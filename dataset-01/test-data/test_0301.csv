4,Viewtiful isn't so beautiful after all.,"I played this game once, and I put it down about 15 minutes later. What I didn't like about this game is the ""showoffy"" main character, and the cliche plot. These 2 things alone add up to a sucky game. The only thing I liked about it are the controls. They're easy to memorize. This game is only worth renting."
4,this is the greatest,"this is a good game .when you beat kids mode you get a music video called viewtiful world. when you beat adult mode you get silva as a carater and he takes double damage. when you beat v-rated mode you get alsaterand when you beat ulta v-rated you get captain blue!!!!!!!!!!!!i can't wait untill viewtiful joe 2 comes out. but it will come out at december 1, 2004. it has more bad guys,silva can be played in the beginning, new backgrounds, and a new abillte called replay which lets you do triple the damage. so save up for viewtiful joe 2 or ask it for chrsmas"
4,Excellent debut novel,"Mallory makes a hit with her debut novel. Despite some unfortunate plotting problems--minor but irritating things like people standing and then standing again or, worse, leaving the room and then leaving again a few lines down the page--this story exhibits strong main and secondary characters, a reasonable suspense plot, and deft, interesting writing. Mallory's descriptions really set the stage, and the romance moves along at just the right pace.I loved the hero, and liked the heroine; her acid tongue and sometimes nearly irrational hatred of the nobility occasionally went too far, but they did show her as a likeable, intelligent but imperfect person. James' friends will likely be heroes in the upcoming books, and that's a good thing; they're just as interesting, if not more so, than James. I did think the big declaration lacked punch and the epilogue was a bit weak. But overall, it was a most enjoyable read. For a first novel, it was very, very good."
1,WASTE OF MONEY - AVOID THIS ITEM,"This should have been a serviceable item and I had high expectations for it, all of which immediately went sour.Tanning salts are still leaching. Nicks along right side of leather strop that destroys a straight razor. Crackling on leather strop which is from imbeciles coiling and shipping in too small a box. Gray metallic stripe on center of linen strop.I AM SO UNHAPPY AND DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS. It would be more of an inconvenience to return so I kept this garbage item and it sets my mood each day when I strop my razor.1-Star Rating."
1,Product discrition is less than accurate...,"Maybe the seller doesn't understand that nylon webbing is NOT canvas? Canvas is a heavy-duty COTTON cloth with a relatively smooth surface... The leather is too hard for use on a sharp razor. With some cleaning and conditioning it can be usable, however the ""canvas"" side is worthless for straight razor use."
3,satisfactory strop,This was also a gift to go along with the razor i bought at the same time. So far my son has no issue with this item as it has worked fine for the little he has used it.
3,leather is lower quality,"The leather side looks like a section purchased from a ""Seconds pile"" rendering factory after all the other good leather was taken the scraps were used to make this Strop.. Bottom line: you get what you pay for.. kinda low rent!"
3,Priced appropriately for quality.,"Not expensive, but also not a high quality product. The leather grain was uneven, and inconsistent. The leather is too hard to properly strop a straight razor, and the canvas side is too coarse."
4,Clever and Touching Story,Frank Capra has taken this clever story and populated it with his great character actor ensemble for a warm and fuzzy happiness.
5,Chevrolet Custom Towing Mirrors,These mirrors worked great for us. They fit over my existing mirrors perfectly. We used them to haul hay on a flatbed utility trailer and could see just fine. They don't rattle and are still in place. We left them on simply because they were so nice that we forgot that they were still on there.
5,THE BEST EVER.,"I have a 1995 GMC Suburban, let me tell you it easily went onto my mirror, and just tighten the towing mirror. That easy, no hassle, and I am very happy with this product. Very fast delivery, and my package arrive safe with no damage inside. Oh plus it serve it's purpose on the road. I did a test drive with them, you can see clearly to the back, plus when your not towing no more you can easily take them off and store it away until you need them again. Two thumbs up for that."
3,get it off,The glove is great until you try to take it off! There are no pull tabs to help remove the glove.
4,Awsome,"I really enjoyed it. Everyhting that I exspected and as good as the last one ""Dark Star"" :) I definitely recommend it"
4,Easy for photos and audio clips; Difficult for video Clips.,"This frame is much easier to use than others I have previously bought for displaying photos.Other frames require changing the images with different proportions in order for them to appear correct on the frame. With this frame, if you maintain image sizes of 480 X 234 pixels, they will appear correctly on the frame without any further conversion.The images and the audio clips will play as soon as you plug in a memory card, and turn on the unit.The only troublesome feature is video. The frame requires MP4 encoded AVI files for video clips, which are a lot of trouble to convert to from MPG or WMV files without special software."
5,"Finally, a real achievement for the PSP","Tekken Dark Resurrection is the first game since the debut of the PSP to ""wow"" me. It has unbelievably crisp graphics, in fact it looks almost as nice as Tekken 5 for PS2 on a similar sized display. The sound effects are also along the lines of part 5, where they were given a little extra depth. The music is also phenominal, and really shines on a decent set of earphones. There are a slew of game modes, in addition to bonus games (Tekken Bowl is back!), and a really fun customization system, where you can alter players colors and add lots of unusual accessories. Most importantly, the gameplay is as precise as ever, although it will take a few rounds to adjust to the PSPs slightly more cramped controller.This is not only the best looking PSP game thus far, but also the very best fighter ever released for a portable system by a wide margin. If you own a PSP, this game is essential to your collection."
4,"Great, but...","Yes, this is a good game for the PSP and I will not repeat all the good things that have been described in the previous reviews. However, this is not a perfect game and some issues remain:The first one is inherent to the PSP joystick, it is very difficult on a PSP to do a diagonal. And Diagonals are very important in Tekken: you have moves that include diagonals and often you cannot do them; the timing to press 2 buttons at the same time is very, very difficult to get and it seems more often than not that it is just luck.The second issue is related to on-line tournaments: you can register for a tournament only if you were able to perform 10 move combinations, and guess what? These combinations include diagonales... So far I was not able to compete against others and this is saaaad..."
4,Great Game,"Probably one of the better games for the PSP... the graphics are great, and the sound is really good.My only complaint would be maybe as to how repetitive it is, but hey, it's a fighting game."
5,Colorful autobiography of a very successful pet behaviorist,"Warren Eckstein and Denise Madden, both self-proclaimed animal lovers have outdone themselves in composing their new book.It is a personal, funny, sad, and loving look at Warren's colorful life. He is unlike other celebrity dog trainers. He is progressive in the way that he approaches animals and way ahead of his time in his attitudes toward animals.This book captivates his love of animals, his experiences both as a child growing up in New York's Long Island and as an adult training celebrities' animals.Warren's autobiography is entertaining and delightful. His love of animals and animal welfare comes accross very clearly. He is definitely not like his colleagues who talk the talk, but don't walk the walk.I hope that you will enjoy the book as much as I did and think of giving it as a gift for that animal lover in your family."
3,Not really hardcore at all,"Best movie on disc is ""soul of the demon"".Other movies on disc is kinda lame and I say this because I'm a True Horror Fan.Worth paying $4.00 for,not much more.Pendulum pictures should have a ""Best Of"" dvd collection without some of these lame movies.From a Zombiemaniac,James."
1,I agree!,"I ...was really disappointed upon ...listening to it. It's definitely a remix, shallow in sound and nothing close to the original songs. From now on, I will definitely read all reviews before buying something like this. I wish I knew about the Amazon reviews sooner...Now I'll have to buy another CD of hers but I'll just make sure it's the real thing! ...."
3,"Good short stories, but has nothing to do with bedtime.","This book is a nice collection of short stories, but none of the stories have a thing to do with falling asleep. Buy this book because you want more of Richard Scarry's wonderful stories, not because you want to soothe your child to sleep. I myself feel let down because I thought I was buying stories to put my child to sleep to."
3,The book wasn't bad but it wasn't great either,"If you like strong women in your book this isn't the one for you. Yes the main female character has lost her sister and had her nephew kidnapped but come on. Throughout most of the book she needs someone to take care of her. It drives me crazy. I really wanted to love this book but I just couldn't. I found myself giving up almost towards the end. I just started to lose interest. The other thing I had issue with is how the main female and main male characters fell in love so quickly. I know some people believe in love at first sight but come on. It would have at least been nice to see them slowly fall in love. That would have made it all the greater. SIGH. I don't know. I can tell that I'm in the minority here. Go head, read the book. You might actually like it, but I didn't."
2,sharp and bulky,"blade is sharp, but handle is heavy and a bit unwieldy. i use a pinch grip and the bolster isn't beveled and has sharp edges that make a pinch grip uncomfortable unless you are cutting the softest of vegetables. good for the home cook but if you are a professional or have developed good knife skills you will want to look for something with a better balance. also knife hit the wood floor of my kitchen (accidents happen) and the tip of the blade was bent and chipped."
5,It Happened One Night,"Frank Capra's sublime romantic comedy swept the 1934 Oscars, and it's still easy to understand why. Few seventy year old movies hold up like this one. Colbert makes a charming, deft comedienne (check out that hitch-hiking scene!), and Gable was never more appealing, winning his only Oscar for this role. The scene where Peter takes off his shirt and exposes his bare chest was a first, and reportedly, sounded a death knell for the undershirt industry. Hail to the walls of Jericho!"
5,This is a really good movie.,"If you like classic movies, this one happens to be for you. You should get it, no matter the cost."
4,It happened One Night,Sorry have not watched it yet -- really can't assess -- but anything Claudette Colbert will always please me. It was the first film to win all 5 major Academy Awards and I would like to see why
2,Great Collection; Horrible surround mix,"Everything on this SACD has been previously released with the exception of the bonus track (which is essentially a 48-second instrumental version of ""I Can't Help Falling in Love with You"") The stereo layer is no great improvement over the previous issue, but the new surround mix is horrific. The vocal is overbearing for some strange reason, rendering the surround mix virtually unlistenable. Disappointed!"
4,Kingsmen: Standing Room Live Video,"This is a Live video from the Kingsmen Quartet from 1991. Group members include Big Jim Hamill, Eldridge Fox, Greg Fox, Anthony Burger, Ray Dean Reese, Gary Sheppard, Parker Jonathan, and Gary Dillard.Song list on this video:I'll Be Satisfied,We Represent the King,A Beautiful Life,Anthony's Salute to the Troops,Ring Out the Welcome,Prodigal Son,Bought By the Blood,Wish You Were Here,God's In Command,I Just Stopped By.A very enjoyable video."
3,"Not great, not terrible, ending great.","Wade Rouse's slightly better than average memoir elucidates snippets from his life growing up fat and gay in the Missouri Ozarks. He lives in an exceedingly rural community with an overwhelmingly close but loving family and therefore spends most of his life pretending he is not gay (although, as he states several times, it's quite all right to be fat). Most of the stories are humorous, such as when Wade dresses up in his mother's bikini and crowns himself ""Miss Sugar Creek,"" and others are heartbreaking, like the entire section regarding Wade's brother's death.Rouse is an engaging and descriptive writer, and I enjoyed reading about his life. I was going to give this book a completely average review, but the final section of stories, about Wade finally coming to terms with his sexuality, completely redeem the rest of the exceedingly mediocre book."
3,Poor Judgment,A very unusual storyline with explicit language and activity. Rarely seen erotic material involving a woman who appears to be at least 65 years old. Lot of pathology to think about in a family that shows chronically poor judgement in almost all areas of their lives.
3,Appreciate Effort...But Not Impressed,"The Mother was an interesting attempt to portray a working-class woman of a certain age (well past her prime) and the life/love/passion she still longs for. Well acted, well directed, but the writing was lacking something that could give some deeper meaning or understanding of this sad woman's life. The depression of the lead character overwhelms the film and leaves a void so that the audience can only pity this wretched woman; but never truly comprehend her pain."
1,Disappointed with this supplier.,I can't sat anything about the movie because it doesn't work. Now I'm stuck with a movie that can't be watched or pay for shipping back to the U K that cost more.
5,Good Knife,The knife appears to be of high quality steel. The design is very balanced and is the perfect size for many uses when an 8 or 10 in. knife would be too big.
4,Love these knives! But NEVER put in dishwasher!,"Well that pretty much sums it up. Great knife, good balance and feel. Keeps an edge most of the time. But never never never put it in your dishwasher. This purchase was to replace my previous knife which went through the dishwasher routinely. Then one day, we noticed the handle was warping and had hairline cracks all around the tang area. So lesson learned. And the warranty is only good if you don't use the dishwasher. Enough said."
3,Midling film with some good period footage,"WUSA is one of the late 60s/early 70s Hollywood's take on the new ""counter culture"". It's neither one of the better nor one of the worst examples. The story, of a radio station controlled by a wealthy elite promoting reactionary propaganda to stir up far-right hate, might have been more dramatic or even prophetic if handled better. Newman performs well but he can't overcome the weak script.What I wound up enjoying the most about the film was the extensive amount of on location footage filmed in New Orleans in 1969 and 1970. Mardi Gras parades, the old Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and lots of scenes of New Orleans of yesteryear. (Of course the actors talk with the stereotyped accents that sound nothing like what is heard in New Orleans, as seems to be the case with almost all big studio treatments of the city before ""Treme"".)"
3,OK But Not Great,"Scissors blades are OK, but the action is a little stiff. Maybe there's a way to lubricate it, but the vendor did not provide any information regarding this."
4,Expanded classic for toddlers,"My 10 month old has recently become interested in sing-along books so I thought this would be one of the classics to get. However this isn't the original Itsy Bitsy Spider version. My fault, I should've paid closer attention to the description that said this is the EXPANDED VERSION of the classic song. I'll have to try this book again when my daughter is older. Right now, she can only tolerate a few words on a page at a time and she needs bright close up pictures of people or animals."
3,"Not horrible, but glad I didn't buy it","I was able to borrow this from the library before purchasing it. I'm glad. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth it as compared to other books I've read to prepare for pre-schooling my kiddo. It's a diary of one mother's experience, which is fine. It wasn't bad writing, but it wasn't really good writing either...and didn't give many details of actual activities they did, which is what i was looking for."
5,"wonderfully meditative,peaceful music","Most of Richard Burmer's best works are exhibited in this collection. It is music for the quiet of evening or the stillness before the day starts at dawn. Richard Burmer takes electronic keyboarding to a very acclaimed height. Highly reccomended if you like Enya, Ray Lynch, Patrick Ohearn and Yanni!!!"
1,Postwar,"A very bias, one sighted view of Europe at the postwar period. Some statistics quoted highly unbeleivable from dubious sources. It would seem that Judt wanted to describe the period based on his pre-existing views, identifying Communisam and Stalin as real villians of the time where Nazism, Fascism, Hitler and war time Germany were only a curtain raisers. What a hogwash!"
3,Poor presentation,"This book lacks a good presentation, therefore it lost me, and probably many other readers as well. I'd imagine this text is intended to be sold to students and scholars, and although scholars might like the format, students will hate it. The book has a constant feel of jumping from place to place without any transition. Even something like subtitles in the chapters would have helped the reader focus a bit more, but even that is non-existant. Rather it just seems like Judt is rambling on, throwing in numbers and facts when necessary. The book also downplays the role of America in shaping European history. I would not recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know European history in the second half of the 20th century well already, because you will have a hard time following Judt's presentation."
3,"A terrific book, but one big problem","First, this is a magisterial book written by a writer who has always been brilliant, as a reviewer and as a historian. But I'm surprised he (and his publisher for that matter) have not been taken to task for not including endnotes and a bibliography in the book. No matter what the stated reasons for not including it -- there's a footnote in the book that explains the author's rationale for excluding them -- I think it borders on the scandalous that they're not there. Even more inexcusable is the fact that reviewers in major newspapers and book review journals have not even mentioned the glaring absence of such important pieces of scholarship."
4,"Not quite what I was looking for, but","The information will be very useful in the near future, see my other reviews"
4,An amazing depiction of life in Arthur Pendragon's court.,"This book was absolutely amazing to read, told by the wife of Arthur Pendragon, high king of the British Isles. She tells of all the conforming pagans becoming christians, of her struggles as the wife of a king, and the suppression of her own feelings, only for the dignity and honor to her name. A truly memorable book. Look for the prequels and sequels and tell me the names of them."
3,ah that explains it,"It was fun seeing this story form the womans point of view, and again somewhat believeable (as in book one) I must admit though , that I am not interested in book 3. there was just not enough to interest me in reading more, at least not at this point. I feel this second book draged just a bit."
4,Good second book in the trilogy,"I enjoyed this book, as an extention to the first in the Trilogy. Gwen continues her journey thru life as a young woman, and a 'partner' to her young husband, not a 'trophy wife'. She's still a bit of a tomboy, and jointly rules the emerging kingdom with Arthur.The unpleasant parts of the Ledgends are dealt with, but not dwelled on - time to get on with life and pulling all parts of Britian together."
4,Queen of the Summer Stars,I enjoyed reading all 3 books in this trilogy. It is eloquent in writing style and kept me interested enough to be excited to start the third book.
1,not for Mac,"I have the updated version of this CD which includes the Pisgah District. I bought it for a MacBook and find it impossible to load. They indicate that it has to be installed on the hard drive but when I copy all files to the hard drive, the downloaded software upgrade cannot find it. Very frustrating. I loaded it on an old XP and it worked very smoothly. Looks like a good PC product but you must have to be a Mac wizard to make it work on an Apple.Jim L"
3,"Ok, for a textbook","Its basic at best, nothing new or innovative. Kinda boring, makes a horrible text book ok reference guide."
1,Ripped me off... Bait and Switch PRO's!,"I ordered this item and it was a complete bait and switch... I was charged 51.00 US and was shipped the ONE piece (hand masker ONLY) and was NOT given my change back nor DID AMAZON do anything about it once I complained to them of these guys pulling the bait and switch. This said I STOPPED spending my hard earned money here altogether, as they need us/our money much more than we need them. Until they either give me the product that I actually PAID for I am not spending another dime within Amazon which is unfortunate because most vendors here do indeed have great products and morals as to NOT pull the old bait and switch. The major problem I have here is that Amazon did NOTHING after I placed a complaint in their system... You think they have your back until you actually get ripped off to find they actually don't care.Bu-buy Amazon."
5,2nd edition...manufactured 2002,"out standing writing instrumenti got mine from e_bay for 200$, for collectors.. MUST HAVE pen"
1,Dissappointment,"This game is a big dissappointment. With the anticipated release, this game is laden with bugs and game play errors. It installs fine on the computer, both XP and Vista, but never gets to game play. Always crashes, the EA support team doesn't provide any support for this problem. Their response is always canned and scripted, no real support. DO NOT Buy this game until you read all the user forums on this game. Waste of money. Buy at your own risk, if you have 50 dollars to throw away, go ahead and purchase."
3,HAving trouble,"I love this game and was replacing a MAC version because it is no longer supported in the new OS. Had difficult finding the required hardware specifications. When I received it and loaded it on my spar computer, it would not work due to the video driver not meeting the minimums. I am looking to replace the video card and try again, but it is difficult to get anything not made for Windows 8 these days."
5,Soldier's In Iraq Give 2 Thumbs Up,Command and Conquer 3 is great. I have shared it with my fellow Soldiers and we all agree. This is a great relaxer for us and very entertaining. Thank you.
2,Real Time Slaughter (Tiberium sun was better),"First I don't like the balance in this game. Everything dies so fast that there's not really much chance for micromanaging. Eventually the low tech troops are just meat shields. Graphics are ok, effects like lasers are fine. But there is basically nothing new. It seems like a game that could have been released five years ago and for me that doesn't cut it today. I grew up on the first 5 or so C&C games and those were great. IMO, C&C as a great series ended with Tiberium Sun."
2,Reed succumbs to literary cliche,"A beautiful woman murdered, of course. A Yale-educated DA running for office, of course. It seems that Barry Reed is more concerned with looks and education rather than plot and dialogue. In this novel where everyone seemed to have ""fresh, Nordic features,"" Reed focused more on the characters than the story. The only bright spot was attorney Dan Sheridan, who is a down-to-earth, broken-nose kind of player. With each description (which could have been stolen from a soap-opera script) was the educational background of each character. Character description is important, mind you, but not the solitary component of the work. I don't believe that a woman who has been lying face down dead in a marshy area for hours is the most beautiful woman the medical examiner had ever seen. It just doesn't happen. And neither did this book. Barry Reed should read Robert K. Tanenbaum, whose characters are believable and enhance the plot, not replace it"
4,devils claw,my husband used this for his back pain. It worked well.he had a lot less problems when he took it regularly.
4,Not the Version Listed in the Description,"This review is for the VCI Entertainment release of ""The Perils of Pauline"".Strange! When you open the Amazon page for this item, it says: ""The Perils Of Pauline (1914)"" and starring Evalyn Knapp. But Ms Knapp was not in the 1914 version. She was in the lesser 1933 version.IMDB rates the 1933 version 6.1 stars, but the original 1914 version gets 7.4 stars. That's the one I was hoping for. Oh well.Apparently, the original is only partially available as a shortened European release. Guess I'll get that instead.Perils of Pauline (1914 Serial)"
1,NOT Samsung - buy other,"I was considering this for my printer when I noticed on the graphic it is ""Compatible"", NOT SAMSUNG! For nearly the full Samsung price! Why would you pay full price for an off-brand knock-off? We should either buy a toner cartridge at 60% or get genuine Samsung for this price! Shame on Amazon for advertising this as ""Samsung"" brand."
2,TANGO?,"I saw Gotan on DWTS a couple of weeks ago and liked their modern version of Tango. However, when I listened to this album, I was disappointed. I expected traditional Tango and the music was very disjointed. I based my decision to purchase by the reviews on Amazon. I was woefully disenchanted."
4,good condition,"Good condition product, it took a while to be delivered, but it is in a really good condition, Thank you"
2,Not tango dance music,I love to dance to modern tango music. I was disappointed that album was not this type of cd. The first 4 songs start off hopeful but then it fades further away from sounding like modern tango. Contains one classic tango which sounded nice in comparison with some tracks containing rap mixes.
1,Don't buy this phone.,This was by far the worst cell phone I've ever had. You can't hear anything and people on the other line can't hear you. The buttons on the side are very touchy and also control if the phone is on silent or not. Mine will hit against something in my purse and turn itself on ring. This phone is horrible. I do not recommend it
3,Kurland,"Not Lynn Kurlands ussual fair, but ok for fast reading.Other authors are a mix. Not sure I would buy it again."
2,they rust,These knives stain and eventually rust if they are not cleaned by-hand and dryed after every use. They have a nice sharp edge but it doesn't make up for the high maintenance.
2,Not durable,"I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria. I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year. I had the Peg MT single first and loved it. So thought the product quality would be the same. Used it for 2 years with no problems. But have to say stay clear of the aria design. Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc. Its not durable at all! We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too! We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off. My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product. She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno. It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second."
3,Buy the cheaper Graco model,"I am writing this review 18 months after I purchased this stroller. I bought it when my daughter was 15 month old and my son was a newborn. We are very active and I fly quite often by myself with the kids. I would give this stroller high marks for the fact that it folds flat and it lightweight. I give it low marks for the wheels. There is something wrong with the design in that they get turned and you will get stuck. You need a walking start to get through tight doorways and if you stop, you then have to back up and try again. Sometimes it takes me 3 tries to get through doors and I have been using this for 18 months! Overall it has been okay, but if I am paying more than $300, it should be fabulous! Get either the Graco model or the Combi model."
1,Couldn't get past step one!!!,I bought this stroller and couldn't even open it! I brought into a popular baby store that carried it to see if they could show me how...to no avail. They were kind enough to take that one and give me one from their stock...but that one had the same problem. I gave up and did not try again. Unfortunate b/c the 14lb weight was sooo appealing!
2,Not so Great,"I got this stroller when my daughter was 2 and my son was a newborn and I have been trying to use it for a year now. It is VERY difficult to use. When there was a weight difference in my children it would always pull to the side of the heavier child. The wheels do not work well at all. We recently took it to Disney World with us and used it only one day at the park and it was so hard for me to get around with it that I ended up paying $18.00 per day for the remainder of our trip to rent one of their strollers. The positives are that it is lightweight and folds up flatly, though it is difficult to open at times. I would not recommend this product. The cost definately does not equal the value."
3,Its alright!,"Well I really was looking forward to the CD..I couldnt wait..When I saw it on the internet, I jumped on it...When the mail arrived, I slapped it right into my CD player..Well to no evail, I was disappointed....It was to much hype and not enough of the original Loose Ends sound...To much remixing or maybe not the right remix touch....Oh well, I'll listen to it because they one of my favorites in there era..."
4,Different kind of time travel romance,"This time travel romance novel is different from other time travels. In this one the hero travels from medieval england to western america in the 1800's. The dialogue is witty and the characters are fun. I didn't like this one as much as I do other time travel romances, but I read the whole thing and it stuck in my mind, so it was good enough."
4,Suspense of the First Order,"Another pearl of the Ross Thomas oeuvre, two protagonists wish to seek refuge in Durango, a town that makes its income with a very curious illegal enterprise. Again Thomas used his knowledge of political chicanery to imbue his characters (a disbarred lawyer, a crooked chief of police, a convicted state judge) with real life hubris. Lots of fun from the late Grand Master."
4,Good purchase,I had no problems with the seller. My only issue is with the bag... love it but the hard plastic sheet to keep the bottom flat cracked in half. Not really a big deal.
3,Leg Warmers,"They are warm and comfortable. However, they are too small for my legs -- I will not be wearing them. So, my daughter is making use of them. Back to the drawing board!"
1,Returned them - awful,"I bought these based on the good reviews. All I can figure is that some of us get different products than others, because what I got was so bad I had no choice but to return them. The ones I got were weirdly long and narrow. They seemed like they would be awfully tight especially at the top and bottom. But the kicker was the smell. I expected them to be made of synthetic material, and new synthetics usually have a little odor, but the smell of these was awful, like nothing I've smelled before. I left the tags on, wrapped them back up, and shipped them right back."
5,Warm and Cuddly,"I was very pleased with the quality of the leggings I ordered from this seller. They were thicker and warmer, but yet still very pliable. They fit nice and stay up well without binding! I would highly recommend this purchaser and this brand."
5,Great!,I got these for my Halloween costume to stay warm. These are super soft and cozy. I can't wait to wear them outside of the house!
1,cheap quality,I researched different leg warmers before purchasing and thought these looked and read like high quality - I was wrong. They barely cover my short legs. Women with long legs ...look elsewhere.
1,Terrible legwarmer purchase,"I ordered 2 pairs of these a few years ago and they were great. So I ordered a couple more pairs a couple weeks ago. I am very dissatisfied with both pairs. They are very tight and uncomfortable, it was a waste of money."
3,Description,"I dind find where to ask a question, so I did it this way, where can I the details the components of this productoThanks"
5,Delightful!,Ms. Spencer has done it again! She's created a fast-paced story with wonderful characters. I love how the mighty Sebastian meets his match with Lily. This is definitely another keeper!
2,Heavy and broke too soon,I loved the power of this dryer - however it gets VERY hot and can burn your hand if you touch the metal. Also - it is quite heavy to hold.Mine started to smell like smoke so I had to throw it out- it didnt last too long. But the power was great.
2,one I never reread,"Nothing to like in the characters here. Didn't like the characters, the setting, the mystery. All very negative in tone. A reader has to have some hope, some enjoyment, to keep going. The author has forgotten that in this book"
4,Not the best,"I bought it, I always buy these, but now I wonder. I love Holly Winter, Rowdy, Kimi, Tracker, Steve, etc., but where were they in this book? There was way too much time spent on other areas. Eugenics yes, but not the whole book. I would have enjoyed more with the dogs and less worrying about sick cruel humans."
4,Well written and engrossing mystery with interesting charact,"Evil Breeding is the latest of the Holly Winter mysteries. As usual the mystery part is engrossing, but I miss the usual characters and dog show settings. In this mystery, the dogs were just peripheral characters if you could call them that at all. This is a fine mystery novel, but not really a dog lover's mystery as it is billed."
1,"Hack, hack!!!","This series is getting worse and worse! Holly is becoming so obsessive and one-dimensional... In Barker Street Regulars, she was absolutely so obsessed with Sherlock Holmes that, even though she professed to know little about him, she was spitting off quotes here, there, and everywhere. In this book, she rants and raves constantly about Geraldine Dodge this, Geraldine Dodge that. Conant needs to clean up Holly's character and make her a little more realistic and more... I don't even know how to say it. Plausible? The melodramatic spittle and long passages of babbling on and on are horrible. I couldn't even finish this book, and I have a Malamute and love mysteries!! Let's get this show on the road!!!! If you want to read a really good dog mystery, I suggest Carol Lea Benjamin's or Laurien Berenson's books, they're fascinating and readable."
4,Overlooked treasure,"Funny how many have overlooked this treasure. At first glance,it appears quite dated and difficult to follow. If nothing else this book is worth a fortune for buying bottoms. That's right,buying bottoms."
3,It was okay,The book was helpful but it has the same techniques as other books. I thought secrets of mental math was more helpful then this book.
2,Very poor explanations,"I dont think the other reviewers are quite accurate in their assessment of this text. The book does offer many examples, and the pseudocode is very helpful in implementing these methods. The real problem with this book is that many of the explanations of the methods are written in pseudocode. This makes learning the concepts extremely confusing and difficult, as they are written in code. The proofs are helpful, but with the confusing notation in iterative methods, there is no way near enough information to correctly learn what is going on. I took this class in graduate school and never used the book unless I wanted to see some code. My advice: Take notes from the professor, and if you need to code up a method, go to the library and copy down what you need. A VERY poor teaching aid!"
5,Great Choice,"I love a board book, and a giant board book is even better! My daughter LOVES this story. It is so fun and easy to remember, so she loves even more that she knows the story. A great choice."
1,The Worst Book Ever,This book is about a girl named Silly Sally and she's going to town! Along the way she meets some friends. She also does some crazy things. Read to find out what she does and who she meets.I don't like the book Silly Sally because the author kept repeating the words over and over and over again.
5,A favorite book,"This is a great book my 2 year old daughter loves. We checked it out from the library because she loves going ""upside down"" and I finally had to break down and buy it! Such a fun book she can rehearse the whole thing by heart and we read a lot of books!"
3,What went wrong?,"I love RJD2. I actually saw him 2 nights ago at first ave. in minneapolis. He put on a hell of a show complete with a live band. The best part was after the show them man hopped directetly off the stage and took pictures and talked to anyone and everyone who wanted to. I got several pics and asked him some questions and the man couldnt be anymore of a gentleman.Now we come to this, it pains me to say this alot but this album is very very below average. We all have a standard of what we expect RJ to come to and he doesnt even come close. RJ needs to go back to his roots and keep his voice OFF his tracks!!!"
4,Good record,Rjd2 is just trying to give you the full regalia here. Check out his prior records for other great material. I expect good things from Rj in the future.
5,My daughter loves it,"We bought this for my 3 year old daughter and she will play with it for hours. She loves the wide selection of clothes and accesories. And great for mom she can put all the clothes on by herself. The only concern I had is how small the stuff is, but by having her play on her table or on a clean floor we've been able to loose only a couple pieces. Not every child can put the clothes on though because her friend always asks me for help. My favorite thing about it is it all fits in the little closets and closes up for easy storage."
4,Blue Guide to Barcelona,I have just returned from a 8 day tour led by Michael Jacobs. He was extremely well informed and amiable. Before our trip I purchased his book on Barcelona. I found it to be very readable and entraining. On visiting Barcelona I found that his detailed descriptions of the architecture and art to extremely useful for the person who wants more than an ordinary superficial guide to the city. The only disadvantage to this book is that it is by its nature larger in size.
5,"Damn, good album !","Good album i have to admit, the first time i was listening to it i was not impressed because it had to grow on me and now i realy like it, i haven't hear such a good rnb album in months so i'm realy glad with this album. My favourite song is what if the beat the lycrics the vocals the emotion the whole song is perfect i listen to this all the damn time i never get tired of this song everybody that is in the same situation can relate it's self to this song one of the most realest songs in years. Another song that i like is let this go it got a great vibe and the beat is quite tight they could have done this song as the third single.Also my mistakes is a great song all the four members take a lead on this song and bring a great harmony togheter also the production is great.I'm looking forurd to there next album and let's hope that they wil keep focused so they can come with another great album like this."
2,waste of m oney,"I was not impressed at all. Same ole, same ole, same ole......Nothing new or original, in some cases it was just raunchy. I enjoy 112's previous work, but this CD was a real disappointment."
4,How many Tracks r on this CD?,I found an 18th track on the internet and I know sometimes that amazon doesnt always post the correct listing. THe 18th that I found was a remix of track 4. It is for sure a remix but I dont know if its actually on the original cd. I need to know Cause I only want whats on the original. Thanks Folks.
1,Terrible album. No Talent.,"Terrible. Bom bom bom is the only decent song, the rest is absolutely terrible. Absolutely no talent...the songs are terrible, watered down crap, no catchy guitar hooks at all, (the first song only has TWO notes). The drummer is terrible, he cant even get simple loops right, not to mention there are maybe two fills on the whole damn album. DONT waste your money. If you want to hear classic rock-revival music, listen to silvertide. The absolutley disgusting dispicable crap ""the living things"" puts out isnt worth the plastic its burned into. The sad thing is MTV will probably give this terrible band hours of airplay."
4,Chaney bio,"This was always a must see whenever it played on TV when I was a kid, so I'm very pleased to have my own copy that I can watch any time I desire. Jimmy Cagney gives a bravura performance as Lon Chaney, Sr. One of my favorite scenes is when he first gets to Hollywood and is taught what background extras do. He whips open his makeup kit to transform himself into a pirate. Great!"
2,Cheap writing about important subject,"I was sorely disappointed in this novel which attempted to address some issues that will confront us about human cloning. I was constantly distracted by the trite, ""pulp fiction"" writing style, with telegraphed plotting. Sorry, but barely high school level construction or suspense."
4,assembly was very quick and easy - no tools needed,I assembled this unit in less than 30 minutes by myself. Love the heavy duty wheels and the option to have the shelves at any distance apart you would like!
5,Great shelves!,"I have used these shelves before for storage. They are great, easy to assemle andthe casters with brakes make them easy to move if necessary with out unloading everything, and you can set the brake to keep unit in place."
5,A VERY ENJOYABLE READ!!!!!!!!,"If you like romance with a twist, then this is the book for you! I have read several of Carla Cassidy's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Her books always grab you from the beginning and are hard to put down. Dreamscapes is a great series of romance with twists on the paranormal side which add spice and mystery to the average romance novel. This book and the others in the Dreamscape series are a delicious change of pace and makes you crave the next one. Each book is a novel within itself and therefore you don't have to read them in order and it doesn't get boring!"
5,"Samsung HLT5676S 56"" UltraSlim 1080p DLP HDTV","For the money on this rear projection -vs- plasma and lcd, you can not go wrong. Electronics Express (thru Amazon) had the unit here in 2 days and with shipping charges, was still $400 cheaper than retailer. I am very happy with this tv. I have large front windows that allow light to enter room. No problem here. Side view is no problem. I have small child and was afraid of plasma screen. Still fine tuning with it, but if you want a great 56"", this is the one. Football and Nascar are unbeleiveable difference in HD. I truly did not know what I was missing out on!!!"
1,Jumping picture and weird sound,"I ordered one of these through Amazon - it arrived quickly and I was really impressed. It looked great - but the picture didn't. When I walked around in the room (it's on a solid stand) the whole picture shaked. And when changing channels the tv made a nasty clunking noise. Clearly, a lemon. Called Amazon - they were terrific and replaced it. Second one arrived. Same problem. Another lemon? Or is there something not right with this TV? I'm going with the slim one now. I hear they're great and the picture stays where it's suppose to be."
3,"Screen blemishes, no international warranty !!!","I like the TV, but my unit came with blemishes (small dark smudges) on the screen. SAMSUNG does not provide a warranty for international customers who purchase from the USA !!! (I buy in USA & ship to Trinidad)I am an Amazon Prime customer & if I purchased from Amazon directly there may have been some redress.I bought this item through Amazon from OneCall due to a better price at the time. So, I have to live with the black spots on my screen...oh well, you live & you learn.My only other comment is that the audio quality should be better.Edit : Two years later the TV starts getting white dots on the screen. One first & within a few weeks....hundreds! Apparently these white dots are stuck mirrors & the DLP chip needs to be replaced. Expensive & Samsung says not covered under warranty.Another problem, the three HDMI inputs stopped working & I'll be needing another new lamp soon! Talk about high maintenance!!!2.5 stars...because of defects."
3,Avg TV,"My TV was delivered just after Christmas 2007 from Amazon. I had to call Samsung today because the brightness decreased considerably, and peoples faces were green after only four months of operation. I was on and off of hold for 40 minutes because their computers were not working. I might add I haven't even used this TV that much because I have a Samsung LCD that I watch most of the time. I'm very disappointed to have problems like this already after spending so much money for a TV. It is a very good picture when it's working, but I'm now wondering if I made the right decision to go projection if these lamps are going to be a problem. Also, if your looking at this TV, spend the extra few bucks for the 61"". I regret not doing so. All being said, I wish I had gone with a plasma."
4,"Works as a great replacement, doesn't charge unless you want it to.","I originally bought this to use on a plane but to be honest, there are better alternatives which are lighter. (Look up Kensington items.)Having said that, I use it as my primary AC adapter at home for my laptop. All rechargeable batteries have limited charge/discharge cycles. (I.e. the more you charge them, the faster they run out.) This item has a button you have to press to actually charge the battery, otherwise it just provides power to the computer. Translation: this should make the battery last longer."
5,Both accessible and scholarly,"More professional historians should write books like this, and more publishers should encourage them to do so. King Death is well-written (no academic baffle-gab), well-illustrated, and well-designed. It is a joy to handle and read.The subject of this book is the long-term consequences for English society of the Black Death. (If you are looking for an account of the plague itself, you should probably go elsewhere.) Colin Platt works his way through the effects on religion, economy, marriage and family in topical chapters.The general reader will get a lot out of it -- will come away with a much greater knowledge of later medieval England and of the effects of population trends on society. I suspect many scholars will find this a useful book, too. This is not a rehash of long-known material, but a study that's as up-to-date as it is accessible."
2,Doggies did not like these.,"Not a bad product, my dogs just did not like them. These are rawhide that is minced and shaped like sausage links. They are supposed to taste like pork. I returned them."
5,If you have every visited Haiti.,"I had a chance to visit Haiti twice in the 1970's while stationed at Guantanamo Bay. Once during Papa Doc's regime and then again shortly after his death. This movie really enlightened me as to what was going on and the scenes of Haitian life, the people, and Port-au-Prince were just as I remembered. Thngs don't change much in Haiti. It is a haunting movie and one I will never forget. And yet it is positive and uplifting."
5,The Agronomist,"The Agronomist is a great documentary about Political life in Haiti. Back home we have a bad political practice, anytime a leader did something wrong The Big fellows came for their rescues. Why, in USA if a leader does something wrong, he/she will be put in Jail. When the Big Fellows stop supporting the dictatorship in Haiti, the haitian people will live a better life."
5,Too short..,Enjoyed reading this book very much. Started the book late afternoon and finished it by the end of the day.
4,Not Bad,"Very fast delivery on the forks. For the money, they are fairly heavy utensils. They just arrived today, and I immediately unboxed them. The only issue I have is that two out of the dozen have slightly bent tines."
4,They're okay,This flatware is okay but not to my expectation. I thought that it would have more shine to it but it is okay for every day dining. I wouldn't buy them again because I like a better quality of stainless steel. These don't shine like I like them to shine but they are not a bad buy.
5,An great first solo album for Toto's guitarist,"Steve lukather writes and collaborates with lots of talented musicians such as Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx and Steve Stevens (just to mention a few) to create this album. It'a mixture of great guitars and some ""80's super group"" type songs - ""Lonely beat of my Heart"" (track 7) is a excellent example. Track 3 ""Fall into velvet"" is a nice example of different guitar effect sounds with at least 3 solos from three different guitarists including Steve himself. I originally bought this album because I'm an avid Toto fan, and I was curious about the solo work of individual members. I was not disappointed, another album ""Luke"" by Stve lukather 9 years after this one shows how his music has matured in style, if you like this one, you'll probably like that one too, it complements this one well (it's quite different)."
4,Great for TOTO fans,"After finally accepting the demise of what was arguably one of the most enduring rock/pop bands in history, I decided to research Luke's solo career in search of more familiar music. Although he does sound a bit different on his own, you can tell that he had a big impact on TOTO's music and vice versa. It's no wonder the TOTO sound had become harder edged in the latter part of the band's career.Yearning for the familiar 80's sound, I found this collection very comforting and enjoyable. I also like the fact the there are well known contributors on this album including friend and former TOTO drummer powerhouse Jeff Porcaro (RIP Jeff, you are missed).Any early Luke and TOTO fan should enjoy this album."
5,Get Them While You Can,"FINALLY!!!! After Transformers, G.I. Joe, Voltron, Thundercats, Silverhawks and M.A.S.K. The Smurfs are finally coming to dvd, I have been wating years for this to come out and now thankfully, it is here and it will be mine forever."
3,Loved the Smurfs as a kid...Cheap quality DVD set,"Great to have Smurf episodes in all in one place. Volume terrible. Menu screen is normal but episodes are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. Still, its great to be able to show a cartoon that I loved as a kid to my 5 year old son."
1,What a rip-off,"I live in Costa Rica and my 4-year old twins do not speak English yet. I bought this item specifically because it said Spanish as a spoken language in the product description. I just got it today, and to my surprise,and to my kid's disappointment, the only spoken language is English. I feel completely deceived and ripped off by Amazon."
4,a dark read but worth reading,"This is less a novel than a triptych of novellas each of which deal with World War II and its aftermath on German citizens. The novellas are arranged chronologically so that as we move along, we get further and further away from the war. The second installment ""Lore"" was recently filmed, but my favorite installment is the last one. This is an important book that poses important questions about morality and avoids glib answers; I found the structure of the book one of the most important things about it."
5,The greatest American animated show continues.,"The Earth kingdom laid out in all its splendor an intricacy. Zuko challenged to define a new destiny, And then there's Toph, she's just too good of a character. You gotta love her. Sokka get's in touch with his inner Captain Kirk. And the Earth Kingdom capitol reveals it's disturbing truths. It's more dramatic than season 1, but just as comedic."
5,Cool!,"There are 5 CDs in this package, four of them have the shows (5 episodes per CD) and one is a bonus CD. The shows are season 2, the Earth set. Our whole family enjoys these shows together--the good guys learn from their mistakes and continue to get stronger and make better decisions, some of the bad guys are doing some real soul-searching and other bad guys step in. In this set, the Avatar meets the ""best Earth-bender in the world"", a blind girl who pushes her limits to do great things. New gadgets and characters are introduced, which adds interest for us. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. Season 2 did not disappoint."
5,Amazing,"This DVD box set is a good purchaes, you will definitly be getting your moneys worth if you decied to purchasses it. I mean season two a of Avatar is amazing and this is a great colletors item, but what makes it even better is the fact that it comes with a whole bonus disk full of other enternaing things. Not to mention the deformed shorts which from my experience are halrious. There are also interviews and other things that take you behind the scenes. It's season two and more which makes it all the better. BUY IT!!!"
1,Don't waist your money,"This book is just like the Jesus Seminar. A sham. It is a bunch of egotistical atheists trying to rid the world of Christianity. They like to pick and choose what is true from the Bible based of their great wisdom of the first century. They really like to remove anything that would convict them of any wrong doing in their lives.If you enjoyed the Davinci Code; IE. You are easily entertained and like to believe lies rather than the truth, this is a book for you. If you want the truth about Jesus try, ""More than a Carpenter,"" by Josh McDowell or ""The Case for Christ,"" by Lee Strobel."
2,Great disapointment & definitely not worth the price you pay,"It is a total disappointment. I decided to return the book five minutes after I start my initial glance. The design, style, format, and writting syntex of those job descriptions is kind of outdated that in my point of view warrant major overhaul. The 10 pages job description writting guide is so simple that they provide common intuitive knowledge. The ADA part initially seems somewhat like a selling point. However, I also find it disappointing as it is again very general & simple. They are many public sources available for such kind of general information that I don't need turning to this book for solution. I bought this book with the intention of shelfing it in my HR department's toolbook collection. After reviewing it, however, I believe it does not serve the purpose as it won't help our HR practitioner much. To conclude, It is poorly written and edited that definitely not worth the extraordinary high price of ()."
1,A major rip off!,"As one review has already stated, these are not the original recordings. The sad thing is that it is packaged as if it is a quality disc. The art work is misleading and the title Essential has recently been used on a number of original recording sets. The fine print, once you know to look for it, only says, disc one 1996. However it is blended in to the middle of the paragragh on the back. Major con jop. Shame on this record company. The only redeeming quality is that John died in 1997 and there is some sentimental value to the fact that these recordings were so close to his passing."
5,An excellent summary of Jerry Brown's talk show content,"The book is vintage Jerry Brown. The various people with whom he holds discussions on a variety of issues builds a consistent humanistic position with regard to the current situation in the United States. These are views that come from ""reading between the lines"" with regard to what is happening in our country--and in the world. The discussions are truthful, impactful, revealing and very intellectual in nature. The dialogues will open up your mind to events and conditions, even if you disagree with the stated positions. And, the discussions should make everyone more aware of what is happening around them, particularly in the areas of the economy, the environment, politics, social agendas and military research."
1,for fans only,"i bought this album at the urge of a couple of friends who are big NIN fans. of course, they think this album is the best thing ever put out, but i hate it. maybe trent reznor's sending messsages, but i'd rather just read the lyrics in the cd jacket than listen to his aimless yelling and screaming and the offkey melodies. NIN is NOT prog rock and they don't compare to pink floyd. do waste your money on this album if you're ""trying"" them for the first time."
3,incredible,"You have to really understand NIN to be able to listen to this CD. For the most part, Trent makes flowing LPs, and this is no exeption. Many complain that there aren't enough standout hits, and this is true, because he doesn't write that way. It is intended to be listened to the whole way through, and when you do that, from Somewhat Damages to Ripe (With Decay), you'll come out feeling a bit overwhelmed. But that's why a true NIN fan would listen, because there's more than music here, there's actual feeling that some people just don't get. Give it a shot, it's a beautiful work."
5,best cd ive ever heard,"well even if no one reads this it doesnt really matter because i wanna voice my opinion anyways on this cd. When this cd first came out i was unsure of getting it cause of the price tag(it was like 45 at first) so i waited until i finally saw it for 25, and i must say the this is the best cd ive ever heard, i listen to it everynight with headphones on when i go to bed and all the time in the car. why you ask? BECAUSE EVERY SONG ON BOTH CDS ARE GREAT!!!! my mom is totally against trent reznor because she thinks he is satanic but i was listening to la mer one day in my room and she goes oh jared this song sounds nice i like the piano in it. seriously, if youve never heard this guy before im sure youll like at least half the songs on the cds, the songs are great, the song writing is ingenious, and the music is the best hes ever done, he really outdid himself on this double cd set, ITS A MUST BUY!!!!!!!"
5,An Inspired Masterpiece,The Fragile being my first Nine Inch Nails album I bought it because it was on the top of so many best of 1999 lists. Even had I not know that Reznor did everything on the album I would have guessed seeing the cohesive thought. Good. Buy It.
1,zzzzzzzzzzz........,"Wake me up when it's over. This is the most boring album I own. There are too many interludes and any interesting musical idea is dragged on six minutes too long. This album makes mid-seventies King Crimson albums sound focused. The only similarity between this and The Wall is that there are two cds. Pink Floyd kept things moving, conveyed its ideas and had GOOD SONGS. I don't need to go track by track because each one sounds like the last one. Glut of content does not make a good album. Trent is creatively dead. This cd gets one star for ambition, zero for performance."
5,Trent doesn't only rely on SFX,"No matter what a lot of people will say about trent reznor, he does rely quite alot on artistic inspiration to conduct his music, his music is more than the rattling chain, ghost scream and other BS that would come from most retards given a computer to play around with. This music is some of the only real truly inspired music to be found it mainstream. To the person who assumes trent only uses a computer to make interesting noise, i would like to ask; you're in a band aren't you? and you're band sucks right? that could be the only explanation for your bitterness and contempt for something that is so obviously aesthetically correct. Also piano don't always sound good, they usually suck (billy joel, elton john). Trent's voice is not a pretty voice, that is why he plays emotional music, he knows this, and his music would not sound as good with a choir hymn, rock is meant to have guttoral trashy singing (think Kurt Cobain or even David Bowie)."
5,Best Album of the Year,"This CD is addictive, there's no other way to put it, it's that good. I had never bought any of their cd's previously and didn't even consider myself a fan, until now. It was only after watching their performance at the VMA and reading the reviews that I decided to buy The Fragile. Every song in it is great, especially The Big Come Down. TRENT RULES!!!!!!!"
5,trent scores again.,"This cd rocks! Trent Reznor has come back in a big way and this album is definitly worth more than a few listens. This is exactly what rock needed even though Trent does not want to be classified as rock, this cd is definitly the best thing to come down the pipe in a long time."
4,Both Trent Reznor and the brink of despair are back,"Nine Inch Nails sound better than ever in this two-disk collection. It took Trent and the other Nails more than five years to fill these disks, and he sounds better than ever. Although the album still is filled with the expected dose of hand-wringing lyrics, only NIN can create these sounds. A must buy!"
5,Definetly as good as I expected,"I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this album with ""the perfect drug"" and ""burn"" seeming to set the stage. But it is a beautiful mixture of grinding guitars and quiet harmonics. Although a bit slower than TOD it is very worthy of any and all acclaim it will recieve. Trent Reznor continues to amaze, astound, and sometimes confuse me but this album is a must for any true NIN fan."
5,Exactly Where Nine Inch Nails Should Be,"This is everything I expected from an anxiously awaited new NIN album and more. I remember in some interviews that Reznor had always wanted to do a type of album that could be thought of as a clearly classical work of art. This is completely what I'd imagine he'd make of that idea. It's amazing and has to be played on a great stereo with great volume without distraction. I love how the songs flow. My favorite tracks are Somewhat Damaged, We're In This Together and Pilgrimage. Reznor has proven himself a master with this one."
4,Their music is a little out ther but I do like some of the songs,I did not like all the songs but overall it is still a good cd. The songs I do like made it worth buying
5,"""The Wall"" for the 90s","Nothing less than a comparison to Pink Floyd's crowning double album will do for this masterpiece by Trent Reznor. Such a magnificent achievement in songwriting, producing, and performing has rarely been seen: it was like a huge rusty nail that shot out of 1999, the year of the huge pop revolution. Needless to say, it was far outsold by lesser albums by Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys, which is a terrible shame. ""The Fragile"" is one of the rare double albums that doesn't drag on too long, doesn't contain more filler than killer (at least to me), and it was a soundtrack to the first year in high school for me along with Dr. Dre's ""2001"" and Beck's ""Midnite Vultures."" A masterful achievement, you shouldn't look it over - beside the raging rockers, the quiet atmospheric songs (the final two songs on the ""Left"" disc are particularily wonderful); beside the tortured lyrics, the pleas for sanity. A great album, and a definite trip for anyone who dares take it."
5,Has distortion ever sounded so artistic?,"This is a brilliant album. ""Downward Spiral"" showed glimpses of what's in ""The Fragile"", and even thought DS holds a special place in my heart, TF is the definative NIN album for me. One thing about NIN that really makes the band (or should I say Trent) stand out is the track-list order. This album really is best listened to on the computer, one song flowing into the other, both Left and Right CD's, and then just delete the so-out-of-place ""Starf***ers Inc."" track. This is not an easy album to get into, but once you've given it a chance it'll easily rest atop NIN's other excellent works with its cohesive design."
3,Even though Trent Reznor is a good musician...,"He dint do well on this album. I own PHM, Broken, Fixed, TDS and i love those albums but this album lacks the energy that trent reznor had in 1994. On the older albums he had stand out songs, on this its the same quality as marilyn mansons albums. I think that when Trent signed him on Nothing that he got really screwed up and marilyn manson became succesful, its tragic."
4,Reznor moves from noisescape to soundtrack,"Ever since David Lynch's Lost Highway, Reznor's perfection as a film score writer struck me as a natural progression for this post-industrial soundscape creator. The Fragile is a multi-layered and evocative ""soundtrack"" which, if you listen to at a low level, has the ability to make effective (if trendy) dinner party muzak, but if turned up will shake the floor and fill you with an unnamed anxiousness. And this is Reznor's strength: combining unique and often confrontational ""melodies"" with a sense of real emotion; regardless of whether it scares the shit out of you or not. Never one to rest on past achievements either, Reznor has once again changed his style, which is certain to open up new discussions on how effectively he's done it and how important it is. And it is important."
1,"boring music, moronic lyrics","I WAS a NIN fan...until I bought the much anticipated, much delayed Fragile 2CD experience. He takes five years to write this stuff, and whadda we get? His BAD Aphex Twin impersonation. After trying for 3 days to listen to the first CD through, I got to the marginally better 2nd CD. Of course the songs that caught my ear, I soon realized were the ones that sampled from his previous CDs. Nothing caught my attention (not a problem with Broken, TDS, PHM & FDTS) The lyrics were also crawling up my butt, cmon, ""I try to save myself but myself keeps sliping away""? please! Maybe he can help the local High School write their rally cheers too. The album is boring, bland and a shining example of filler gone wild. So my point is, save your money, keep your pants on and buy ...Sarah MacLachlan she seems to be doing harder stuff."
1,Its painfully obvious that Trent has exhausted his talent,"I was always a big NIN fan as a youngster. His early work (PHM, TDS) was excellent. No question, he basically defined a whole new genre of music. Then all those remixes and stuff started to show up and it was obvious that he was slipping. Now we have this 'thing'. This albums sounds as if Trent let some 8 year old fan of his write the lyrics and some dope head off the street arrange it. Pure trash, it seems only the seriously hardcore NIN fans can enjoy it, just like some blind devotion to dying religion. I mean, listen to the words! ""even now after everything, you're the queen and I'm the king"" I wrote better poetry than that as a child. Give me a break. Not to mention the sound on the songs is way to harsh and fuzzy. I used to be able to relax and really get into his music and now it just makes me laugh. Too bad there's no 0 stars rating"
2,Eh.,"I've been listening to this all day and it isn't doing much for me. The melody of previous albums isn't there. Mostly, it's just loud and repetitive."
3,The more you listen the more you love,"One of the most complex albums I have heard in a long time. Any Reznor fan should own this, it will go down in the books as a ""Revolver"" or better yet, a ""Downward Spiral"". Reznor really is the man of the hour with The Fragile"
5,HOTNESS,"These cds are (...) awesome the lyrics are awesome the instrumental is awesome , its very good if you get tired/ bored of one cd (which is just gay if you do)you can just switch, trent is the man and he is the pure hotness and he is pure love"
5,Damn good,"OK, I'm not a NIN fan. In fact, I bought this CD just out of my curiosity for NIN. This is definately a good buy for anyone interested in NIN, though you should check out ""The Downward Spiral"" first. The ""left"" disc has some particularly good tunes, including a few good instrumentals, while Trent experiments with a few different styles on the ""right"" disc (my particular favorite on this CD is ""Into the Void"", he even tries heavy metal with Starf**kers, Inc.). You should check this CD out."
2,Refreshing,"There is better music coming out since TDS (Moby, haujobb, Delerium, etc). But, you gotta give it at least 2 stars just because of the high quality of production done on these discs. I was also rather surprised at how much maturing the reznor sound has undergone in 5 years, its much more playful. Some of the tracks are absolutely beautiful, Just like you imagined, and La Mer are awesome. Stop singing, and this album is 4 stars (is anyone just a little tired of the the whole angst/personal issues thing?)"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I am not a fan of NIN. I was hesitant to pick up the album once I saw it was a double disk (and would drain my wallet).But, out of sheer curiosity, I got it. It is absolutely tremendous. The dark and heavy stuff here is balanced with beautiful, underlying rhythm and bits of hope and progress. Some of the voiceless pieces, like 'Pilgrimage,' are programmatically excellent. You actually get the feeling that you are on some trek, with people talking and laughing and marching. In ""The Wretched"" you hear people screaming in the background, as if you were descending into hell. What seems like monotony is bolstered by clever tweaks and semi-melodic passages. The only kinks are the lyrics, which are, sadly, trite. Otherwise a truly excellent achievement and better than anything out in popular music today."
5,Excelente,"Es un gran disco, cargado de atmosferas y sonidos electronicos donde quizas se echan de menos los riffs industriales de sus otros discos. Pero es una obra completa con muy buenas letras quizas las mejores que haya escrito. Lo recomiendo, no solo a los fans, sino a todo el publico."
5,Can't imagine a better book on the topic,This book is a very good and thorough treatment of the topic of love and the results of failure to love. Powell is convinced that unconditional love is the only true love. Anything else is manipulative.
2,Several hours of life that I will never get back...,"First off this book was very well written. I have met the author and she is a very intelligent woman. However despite her intelligence and writing ability, this book was terrible. The entire book is a soap opera, the characters sleeping with one another and then blaming their actions on someone else's black magic. Would I recommend it to anyone? no."
2,NICE THE SHORT TIME IT LASTED,"Bought this cooker approximately one year ago. Have used it less than ten times. Washed only by hand--never in the dishwasher. Tonight while hand washing it, the lid fell out of the black rim. The silicone seal was partially detached and starting to tear. Could only rate two stars as it did not last very long considering how few times it was used."
3,Really MINI - not a great deal for the price.,"I should have read the description closer than I did...I assumed mini just mean shorter (still fat) chalk sticks for little hands...but these are TINY! They are the size of the chalk sticks my teachers used back in elementary school. These are fine for chalkboard use, but they aren't going to be great for sidewalk chalk. Between the super tiny size and that a bunch of the sticks were broken when we received them- I don't think these were worth the price (almost $5) at all. I was disappointed with this product."
4,"Good overview,coverage and easy to understand","This book provides a good coverage of the technology,methods, and the core ideas of four leading biometricsystems. The various real-world applications for thesesystems, the performance, current state of art are alsodescribed in details. It also discusses the benchmarksfor comparing the performance and for systemimprovements.This book is easy to understand for readers who arecompletely new to world of biometrics. It providesuser an overview of each system, their practicaldrawbacks, providing the reader an idea of whattechnology to choose for a particular type ofapplication and enough information where he canrelatively make a choice of which technology to investin taking into consideration the time of deployment,cost etc."
2,Wrong Title,"Dissapointing ... I bought this book and find how far is the content compared with the title. It should have been ""A Brief Introduction to Adobe Photoshop from A Wedding Photographer"". The book is just too basic."
1,"Don't buy this, missing outtakes","Don't buy this dvd, it is missing all the outtakes from the television show, particularly from playboy model kelly monaco"
5,Wonderful Stones!,"Ruth Stone's poetry has often been seen as melancholic or ""dark"" ; but her more recent pieces have an edge, a fierceness of diction and imagery that startles the reader.""Living in hell, as I do,the devil lies in my ear.Violent endings, devastation,I am either the shipped out cargo ..."" (""The Jewels"") etc.Her National Book Award ""In the Next Galaxy"" carries her voice to greater peaks still. That voice will never grow old... different, yes, but rejuvenated."
1,boring,"The cd I am reviewing is average. Nothing standout, it has its moments but all and all it's basic death/thrash from Germany. If your into buying rare and expensive metal cds, this is for you. Otherwise there are far more interesting bands to check out. I'd much prefer Vomitory from Sweden."
4,Anime romantic comedy lovers everywhere will love this one!,"Hello there! If you love Romantic Comedies like Love Hina or Please Teacher, you're going to enjoy Happy Lesson: Mama Mia Ova series. After following Chitose through fourteen episodes of man abuse mayhem by 7 beautiful women, you would think that there wouldn't be anymore insanity left. However, that my anime loving friends, is were you would be wrong! The beginning starts off hilarious with an alternate version of the very first episode. Next, you join the whole family as they take a vacation at a quiet sea side resort. And finally, the holiday season will never be the same after you've spent a crazy Christmas with Minazuki, Hazuki and the five Moms. Poor Chitose, We only watch what he goes through with these girl for an hour or two. But he has to deal with them 24-7!A must see, must own, Romantic comedy! Enjoy!"
4,Craftsmenship,"Nick is now a folk, alt-country roots guy (and for a time Johnny Cash was his pappy-in-law) who has followed up his previous LP Party of One with a less humorous but more consistent effort. In fact, its a bit sad, dealing with lost loves, alcoholism and moving on. But music has to be sad to get us through the rough patches. The writing and fine production yield little nuances with each listening.If you enjoy John Prine and John Hiatt then you'll love this. Mines the same turf musiclly and holds up well with those fine songwriters."
2,WARNING!!!! WARNING!!!!,"The product itself seems okay. It was a gift and I've gotten no complaints. As for the company I purchased it from I would NEVER recommend anyone order anything from them. I ordered this product on December 4 and did not receive it until December 26 (AFTER CHRISTMAS). I had canceled my order on December 12, when I was told that the item was out of stock. At NO point when I ordered this was I told that the item was out of stock.WARNING!!!DON'T EVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!! AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! NO ETHICS!! ECT!!! I am in the process of filing a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau against this company."
3,"It's all right, I guess.","It stays sharp for a long time, just like my 8"" Victorinox Chef's Knife (which I love). However, the handle feels really loose and the metal blade is flexible and bends around. It does the job, though, and was worth what little I paid for it. But I eventually want to spend more money on better quality (because I don't think in this case I can spend as much or less for better quality - it was on sale for about $8, I think). If you're just starting out in your new home as a beginner cook, like I was, I guess I'd recommend. Otherwise, go for something else."
5,Nice Little Knife,"Well, of course this isn't a high end, expensive knife, but it's a surprisingly nice little utensil. The handle is larger than the one on most paring knives, which is a good feature, especially if you have large hands. I like the knife, but my husband loves it. The blade has kept its sharpness really well, and it's thin and flexible, but not flimsy. We find ourselves using it quite a bit for peeling, slicing and dicing all kinds of vegetables."
4,the little knife that could...,"This knife made me realize that a sharp knife makes cooking more enjoyable. Apparently my knives weren't sharp enough! I love this knife. It is inexpensive, and so far, performs beautifully."
4,Pretty good paring knife,"Thin blade and sharp. Somewhat light for optimal handling. Cheap and used every day, so a bargain in all the important ways. Needs sharpening again after moderate use."
4,backing,Easy to work with and comes in all sizes. Also adds a little more resistance to cold or hot air intrusion.
1,Terrible!,This table and chairs set was not at all what I expected. I thought I was getting an inexpensive plastic chair set. It is coated cardboard. The box was damaged and the contents were already ruined. The picture makes it seem like it's much sturdier than it really is. I am planning on returning it. I do not recommend this product at all. It will not last even for the most quiet and reserved children's play. I did not even want to give it one star. JUST TERRIBLE!
3,A BLAST FROM THE PAST!,I LIKED THIS CD OVERALL BUT I LIKE THEIR OTHER MUSIC BETTER. tHE 1ST SONG ON THIS CD SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE LED ZEPPELIN BUT ITS A GOOD SOUNDING CD - GIVE IT A GO!
2,Not durable look for others before u choose this one,"my Sansa e250 ripped on the side as i was sliding my MP3 e200 into the pocket, the reflective striping cracked and broke on the side. The actual pocket is made of a really nice stretchy material, but the outer covering has no give. it is also bulky compared to other slimmer ones outhere. not worth the hassle of returning it if its going to break wihtin a couple of days."
4,Works for what I need it for,Has a tendancy to slide down the arm if it is used frequently and the sansa easily slides back out of sleve
3,Cheesy Tunes For Cheesy People,"This album is too cheesy in my opinion. There is; however, a few good songs. Eye opener is a superb mix. Having the vocals of this song slowed down sounds so much better, but I'm able to do that on my own dj system. This album is not a bad price for a 3 cd set, so if you want to give this album a chance I say go for it."
1,This is not Made in the USA,"I just got this set after searching for flatware made in the USA. This popped up, but it is not made here. The set is somewhat lopsided as well. Just thought you'd like to know just in case you made the same search and didn't read the description in detail like me. This doesn't seem to be as nice as the price would indicate. My Old set was cheaper and more detailed and symmetrical. This looks more like a $50 product.Edit: Now I'm disgusted even more with this--cost me $10 for all the shipping. Insult to injury."
4,Candy anyone?,I make candy during the holidays. I have found that the glass thermometers work better than the metal one for my project but I break about one a season. This was a reasonably priced replacement as they are increasingly hard to find in home goods stores. The alternative is to buy one of the hi-tech versions with all kinds of bells and whistles for megabucks.
5,Inexpensive product that does its job excellently.,"This deep-fry thermometer, despite its cheap price, is extremely well-made and sturdy. I haven't encountered a significant problem with the holding pin. I needed a deep-fry thermometer to make fried breads, and this one does the job perfectly. It holds onto the side of frying pan and stays there during the whole frying process, letting me know the oil temperature at any moment!"
3,Decent for the price,"I got this for candy making, and it did its job. The clip for holding it to the pan was a bit loose, so that was annoying, but I made do. I used it for deep frying a couple of days ago, and it blew out the mercury. Like, it's in little drips and drabs all up and down the thermometer. I know this is partly my fault because I probably let the oil get way too hot, but it's annoying that this thing is so fragile.. Still, it did it's job."
4,bowling bag,"good quality bag, holds shoes and ball and accessories well in individual compartments. Good carrying handles."
2,Did not work out,I purchased a queen size and like it fine. It took about a week for thearoma of the foam to go away.This full size did not work out for me. I tried returning online but was routed to a empty website. I also called and left a voice message but have not received a return call. I just want to return the full size and keep the queen size that does work for us!
2,Pinion setting tool,"I can't give this product a favorable review as there isn't much to like. First the ""standards"" aren't marked as to length. After a little time wasted, they can be figured out. Next, there is no way to attach the mounting arm of the gauge to the bearing saddle. The picture shows a person's thumb holding the arm to the saddle. (They have to be kidding!) So, you have to drill a hole in the arm. Next, there are parts included that don't seem to have any function. I asked around the shop, no one could guess what they're for. Finally, the carrying case has no holders for the tool. The depth probes are easily lost, rendering the tool useless. Nothing to recommend here..........."
4,Almost Perfect,"I would have given it 5again stars if there were an exterior flap that covered the zipper. There is an interior flap but in heavy downpours I find that I have a little wet strip down the center of my chest where the zipper is. To combat this problem I wax the zipper to waterproof it.Other than that...Its a great product at an affordable price. The logo does not pose a problem for me as far as size because it is reflective. If it increases my safety a bit than that's worth at least a star. Comfortable, extremely lightweight, breathable and packable. Great for backpacking and bicycling or just walking around town or hanging out at a camp site."
1,Closing mechanism does not work correct,"Unlike other reviews I did not think it was hard to install. I installed it myself, husband was not home, in about 15 minutes. The part I do not like is that the handle does not work, so I am using the sliding sections the handle is supposed to move myself. I think that the babies will be able to figure this out themselves, but our main purpose is to keep the dog out when the babies are on the ground and it does that."
3,The gate could be better,I like the fact the gate worked for a very wide opening. In fact it was one of the only gates I could find that would go that wide. What I didn't like was the part where the screws broke. We had to use other screws on parts of it because quite a few of them broke. Other than that it has held up very well to two small/ medium dogs. Plus a few active teens.
1,Other Options,"There was someone who was asking for another option other than this HORRIBLE GATE!! In the BRU Store you can buy the Summer Exspansion Gate. It is sturdy and trustworthy. Forget this gate, Customer service stinks too. Their response--i called them thinking there was a recall on it (it was that bad) and they said the gates weren't meant for babies or toddlers to handle. i am suppose to teach him to stay away from it. Learn not to go near it. Well, if it was that easy, I would not need the gate at all. I could just tell my nine month old son to stay away from the stairs!"
2,Disappointed,"My husband installed this gate into a high traffic area to keep our dogs our and our baby in, it took at least an hour to install. While it looks nice enough, our 10 month old daughter easily pushes the gate open and has fallen onto the hardwood floor plenty of times. We are not happy with the baby gate."
1,When safety means nothing to your little ones,"I'm am wholely impressed by the amount of engineering it must've taken to put so many 'features' into this gate. The first 13 pages of the instruction book is smartly used to describe the construction of this gate with parts that aren't even included in the box. And after you do enjoy the hunt for the description on how to put the thing together, get ready to embark on a fascinating journey of incomprehensible instructions anyway. And of course, who could forget about designing the gate with an actual lever or handle, and instead focus on the unique design of compressing molded plastic as a locking device. Which is probably not needed anyway, since any little weight on the gate will open it. But that's fine, the last thing you want is for your child to whine and complain when they want to fall down the stairs and have to get you to open the gate for them. Pure genius!"
1,Yikes!,"The only thing good about this gate is the look! It is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to install. My engineer husband was so frustrated with the vague, backwards instructions, he almost gave up numerous times! Once we finally got the gate togethor, we realized how flimsy this gate is! I am afraid that my 8-month old daughter will either break one of the slats, or push this gate so hard that the screws will come out the wall, because there is so much ""give"". I would definately NOT trust it at the top of stairs! Now, after 2 hours of frustration putting it together, we are considering taking it apart and looking for another gate!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! It is so hard to find a sturdy gate that fits a larger opening than the average! The pressure mounted gates seem to work the best, but they are a pain to get by if it's in a high traffic area! -Vicki"
1,Don't Buy This Unless You Love Complicated Directions,"I bought these gates today to install around a fireplace. After reviewing the directions for 10 minutes, I realized I'd be spending an entire Saturday figuring out how to install them from the 20+ pages of instructions. Back they go... I wish I had read the other reviews here first."
1,A complete waste of money! Worst Gate Ever!,"If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these."
4,I liked this gate...,"This was the only gate we could find for our large opening from kitchen to living room Although it does take some work to put it together, if done properly it works great! We never had a problem with it popping open or falling over on our child-she would even try to stand on the bottom in between the slats and hold onto the top!! In the beginning the latch is a little difficult to open, but once you get used to it, it's fine. I would rather have it difficult than too easy!"
1,First Time Mom,"I wish I would have had a chance to read all the reviews before I placed my order for this gate and the extensions. I would not buy this gate again. It is not stable and the gate is not really very easy to open. My husbands exact comment was ""I am just going to step over it"". I would go with the majority on this one and say it is not worth the money, invest in something else."
1,Piece of Junk,"Don't buy this gate system. We spent three hours putting it together and my 8 month old son broke through it in less than 60 seconds. The connections to the walls and panels are so flimsy, he simply pushed one of the panels and the gate unlatched and opened up completely! Now we have to either replace it or drive screws through the floor to secure it. Aaaarghhhh!"
2,Passably interesting but...,"A passably interesting look into life of an ""old school"" agent/manager with some real insights into his client's lives and the behind-the-scenes machinations of Hollywood. WARNING: You'll have to wade through a considerable amount of self-aggrandizment that I found tremendously off-putting toward the end. It's a rare occasion when I don't finish a book but I found myself skipping through the last third and ultimately bailed out with just a few chapters to go."
1,Buyer beware,"I have spent three hours trying to get this remote to work correctly. It will control all your devices, but getting into the menu's and doing things is a whole different story. What a waste of $80, this thing is going in the trash."
1,Seller Review,"Twice I have tried to order this product from DBRoth. Both times the product has been in stock. Each time, 2 days later I receive an email stating,""We're sorry, but the following order from DBROTH has been canceled.We apologize for any inconvenience.""Huh? The remote was part of a much larger order that went through without problem. Only this seller canceled my order... TWICE. Since I cannot leave seller feedback because you must actually purchase a product to be able to do so I am writing this. It is the only way I can try to inform others.Good luck getting your remote. If you really need it. Order elsewhere."
2,Not for me.,"If you believe your home entertainment equipment is smarter than you then this is probably the remote for you. If, however, you believe that you are smarter than the equipment, then this remote will do nothing but frustrate you. It thinks it is *way* smarter than you, and by default includes many, many superfluous commands that just impede rather than enhance the control experience. This is really designed for people who don't understand (or remember) how their equipment works and it is intended to provide a ""dummies"" safe environment. If that doesn't describe you, then you will be disappointed in this remote."
3,Nice Hammer to look at,"I bought this hammer to have a lightweight sturdy hammer for pinging bolts at work, but with minimal force and only after 3 days of use the head separated from the handle and i ended up with a paperweight.."
5,A slow drift,"I never really had a taste for ambient music until I came across this album. Each song peacefully drifts into another, as if your were slowing floating on water. Perfect to relax, meditate or contemplate to. If you don't think you like ambient, you just might like this. Great album."
3,what do you do when one dvd in a set is defective?,"i loved all the movies in this collection,except the young philadelphians dvd because the vocals were out of sync with the video and there were places where the action would halt for a few seconds and then proceed.i believe that this dvd is defective, but how do i get a replacement for just one dvd in a whole set??? the rest of them played well and were a great trip down memory lane."
5,WHERE ARE THE GREATEST HITS VOL. 2 & 3,"THIS COMPILATION IS GREAT AS IT CONTAINS THE COMPLETE EXTENDED VERSIONS OVER 15 MINUTES LONG. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL MANY OTHER CLASSIC DISCO HITS THAT MR. CONSTANDINOS CREATED DURING THE DISCO ERA (MID TO LATE 70'S). THE TRACKS HERE ARE AMONG HIS EARLY WORK AND BETTER KNOWN. THESE TRACKS WERE ALSO BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED BY DON RAY AND CONDUCTED BY JEAN CLAUDE PETIT BUT AGAIN IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT THE GREATEST HITS VOL. 2 COMES OUT. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT MR. CONSTANDINOS HAS ENOUGH MUSIC TO EVEN DO A VOLUME 3 OR EVEN A BOX SET OF 12"" SINGLES (A BOX SEX WOULD BE AWESOME) BUT I WOULD SETTLE FOR GREATEST HITS VOLS.2 & 3."
1,Not so much...,"I love fantasy. I teach high school literature. I read - a lot.And I'm not that picky. I devour books. But this series? I don't think I've ever had as negative a visceral reaction to fantasy, and literature in general, than I had when reading these books. I stuck with Goodkind and read every novel in this series. I wish I had the last six months of my life back. Yes, they were that bad. Obviously, I'm a completist (OCD will do that to you), as well as a glutton for punishment.Before you click ""add to cart,"" do yourself a favor and check out anything and everything written by Robin Hobb. She is simply the best fantasist writing today. Period. There is a depth and complexity to her characters and world building that Goodkind never quite gets his pen around. George R.R. Martin is also stellar, and his ""Ice and Fire"" saga is captivating.Taste is subjective, and I know the positive reviews are heartfelt. I simply cannot recommend this series to anyone. Ever."
3,Starts out strong but gets repetetive,"The setup of the world was fantastic, and reading through the first several books was fast and very entertaining. Right around Pillars of Creation the story-line started to get repetitive, and I lost interest quickly. The formula of (1) Introduce two lovers (2) Get then together (3) Split them apart and rob them of power (4) Bring them back togetheris overused anyways, but to put it SO MANY TIMES in one series is just lazy. Read the first several storylines, and just pretend the series ends there, you'll be better off."
3,"Story was great, but the novel quality was lacking.","I love this series, the shipping was very quick, the only thing I disliked was the quality of the novels themselves. They seemed just like a mass produced paperbacks with missing words and misaligned pages."
5,"Great style, substance and themes.","Goodkind's writing seems to mature with each book, adding nuance and layer to his seemingly simple themes and characters, leaving the reader to wonder to themselves about what ""good and evil"" really are.The stories come alive with great characters, plenty of action, and the wonderment that magical concepts add to the stories. All the fun of being a kid again, but with the adult themes that will keep you reading far into the night.Have fun!"
5,Almost invisible,"The added warmth from this filter is insignificant -- which is fine with me. All I needed was a clean, clear glass shield to help protect my lens, and this filter provided that."
2,There's a reason it wasn't released sooner:,"""Imps*"" was filmed in the 1980s but was never released until now. After seeing the movie I can see why it wasn't released sooner: It just isn't very funny. It's not a conventional movie with a story but a sketch comedy likeKentucky Fried Movie. Unfortunately, most of the sketches just aren't funny at all. As a comedy, it's not recommended. So what about its other asset, the cast? The movie has lots of famous actors in it, from then-unknown Jennifer Tilly to veterans like John Carradine and Keenan Wynn, but most of them only appear for a couple of seconds, delivering a line or two. So it's also not worth watching for the cast alone. In conclusion, not a movie worth wasting money on."
5,Essential Reading for the Horseowner,"This book is excellent. It is written at a level for the new 4-her to understand, yet detailed and advanced enough for the Veterinary Medicine student to use in her studies! I have owned this book for 11 years and it is my favorite. It helps the owner to understand ailments, anatomy, treatments, etc. Well worth the price!"
1,mastey hc+B5 intensive hair mender,"Mastey Shampoo is very good however this well recommended product is a disaster. When you spray it on your hair as a permanent condition it comes out oily and sticky. You have to wash your hair again to get the residue out for you can not run a comb or a brush thru your hair. Perhaps if your had very thick hair you might be able to use it. I dont, I have fine hair. I would never recommend this product or use it again. The distributor would not let me return for refund so I have thrown it in the garbage."
3,Lionel Hutz it a bit limited...,"i was really looking forward to this set because Lionel is one of the funniest characters in the show! However, he only says one phrase in this set ""If I hear 'objection' and 'sustained' one more time, I think I'm going to scream!"" While that line if funny, one is not enough. Phil Hartman was brillian and I want to hear much more from him.... though the blue haired lawyer's ""drinky drinky"" is hillarious."
1,My First Pointe Shoes,"These were my first pointe shoes and I absolutely hated them. They had an extremely hard shank, the box was rounded and restrictive and bulky. They had a great demi, but terrible look and feel on pointe. I would not recomend these as a first shoe because it's likely that the dancer's feet are not strong yet, and even though it's neccesary to have a supportive box and shank, you need to be able to go over the box and have a more pliable shank."
3,Alright but not great,"These shoes are very hard to break in and it takes a long time to do so, and even when they break in they usually don't break in right. The shank is hard and the vamp juts out of the shoe after wearing them for long. I found if you take the nail out of the shank they'll break in easier though. The large platform is helpful for blance though and the hard vamp is supportive."
1,"Afraid to use product, threw it away","When I received my flatware, I was so disappointed. It felt like it was made of tin. Sharp edges and very cheaply made. I threw my order out. I do not recommend the use of these if you have children or for older adults. My cause cuts."
5,well written and compelling,"This is extremely well-written, and does not seem to suffer for being a translated work. The characters are fully-formed, interesting people, and the story is very compelling. I also enjoyed the journal format, as it keeps the story moving well. This book paints a very vivid picture of life in modern-day Damascus."
1,should provide more info on product,"So you buy Music Blocks thinking this is all you need? Wrong, they plug into something else, not even shown on the same page, now try to find the block they plug into!Products that require something else to work should be referred to that item, so the complete package is available!"
2,Thin and and wrinkled,"I purchased this coat online for my husband. He needed a new topcoat to wear over his suits at work. Although it looks pretty nice in the picture, it is poor quality. This coat is pretty thin and wrinkles fast. Because it is so light in weight, it doesn't hang well. It also had a small white mark (almost looked like wax) on the lapel. It is not the same quality as most department store top coats. If you are looking for something that looks professional, I wouldn't recommned it. I found a better topcoat for the same price on sale at Macy's by Ralph Lauren. I returned this coat to Jos Banks."
5,A very good book,"Mercedes did a great job getting into the head of Alberich in this book. I can very easily see both his confusion with the very different culture he has found himself in and the problems the people around him have in trying to comprehend his view of the issues.It is also makes a great companion to the Mage Storms trilogy in that there you have a sheltered teenager's take on Valdemar, while in this book you have a war-hardened adult's view. The two views make a really good contrast.This is one book the will be read many times by me."
2,a lightweight Valdemar novel,"I feel that Mercedes Lackey's recent writings have been divided into two categories: light-weight feel-good fantasy and gritty, gripping immersive worlds. The latter characterizes Lackey's original works and is what largely drew me to her writing.The former I recommend largely for Lackey fans or fantasy fans in need of ""mind-candy"", the latter to everybody.""Exile's Honor"" falls into the former, light-weight category. While it fills in some back-story holes nicely for Valdemar fans, the plot is lackluster (although it does pick up nicely in the last 20% of the book), with the ""good guys have little trouble"" sort of simplicity that has characterized recent Lackey writing with some notable exceptions such as ""Take a Thief"" or ""The Shadow of the Lion"" which fall solidly into my second category.As such, I only recommend this volume to hardcore Valdemar fans. Hopefully its recently published sequel, Exile's Valor, is more substantive."
2,Awkward,"This was the first book I had tried of Mercedes Lackey, and I found I was simply not able to get involved enough to finish it. The story seemed like a good one, and the plot grabbed my interest, but Lackey's writing style seemed awkward and stilted to me, and was what finally turned me off.I was unable to feel for the main character or to get any emotional involvement with him. We are told what he is thinking as if by rote, explained in dry, emotionless language that would outline how each thought came to his head in turn as if numbering a grocery list. I understand that he does not know the language of Valdemar and is used to a different grammar structure, but his way of speaking reminded so much of Yoda from Sar Wars that I was distracted whenever he spoke.This author seems to have quite a following and I fear that I am in the minority. I will perhaps try Mercedes Lackey again and hope this this novel and not like her others."
2,didn't end up using it,"This book looked like a great idea, and certainly had a number of walks that looked interesting, but after we got to London we didn't end up taking any of them. One drawback is if you wanted to take a walk you'd have to drag the whole book with you. It really needs tear out pages. Part of our problem was the weather - cold and rainy, not a big surprise for London in April - didn't really make walking all that attractive. The other problem was our 13 daughter wasn't all that into any of the walks listed. It would probably we useful for adults and a trip when you can expect nicer weather."
5,colorful artist,"I was looking forward to this film which was unavailable in my area, so Amazon provided it,and I was not disappointed. It arrived promptly in good condition and I found the story engaging.It's of special interest to an artist (which I am)."
5,Salespersons Bible,"If you sell anything, especially high end (big ticket) this is a must read. This is not like ""those"" other sales books. This is really about what I call forensic selling. It breaks down what goes on behind the eyes and allows the salesperson to uncover what the client is probably really thinking which is not necessarily indicative of what they are saying! If you are one of those salespeople that think they know it all, this book is for you! Finally a book on the psychology involved in being successful at selling!"
4,An Inspirational Movie,"This movie echoes the theme of another Dilip Kumar starrer under the Chopra banner, Naya Daur (New Road), the theme being the need for capital to respect the contribution of labour and not exploit it. In this movie Dilip Kumar throws in his job when he joins other workers in funeral of a worker killed in an industrial accident, and the management wants to dock their wages. What happens next is that Kumar builds his own mill on the basis of social justice.The romantic element involves the poor textile engineer taken in and virtually adopted as a son by Dilip Kumarwhose daughter, played by Padmini Kolhapure, falls for, while he has fallen for a rich girl.An enjoyable movie because of the strong performance by Kumar, who brings his trademark intensity to the role, and because of the reminder of days when Hindi cinema could produce movies that questioned the status quo"
3,"Hella Optilux OK, but not much light output","These are a good set of lights for the price. They are well made metal housings with a true glass lens. The cut-off pattern is excellent, but the light output is pretty weak. I mounted these on a motorcycle and I'm very pleased with the hardware, wiring, relay and switch provided. The kit should provide all that is needed for most any installation. I'm am going to try and convert these to HID as I think the housing and lens will accomodate such an upgrade."
1,"Good book, but it was hard to understand.","I found it very difficult to understand as I am an idiot, but the different colored grey boxes displaying ""Quick information"" led me away from the body of the text and created confusion for myself."
5,Great Book!,Great explanation of accounting! Highly recommended for all accounting majors before taking an actual class! Great reference during course as well :)
3,Good,Good reference for the non-degreed financial persons. Somewhat hard to read and the examples are not the best for what I needed this book for.
4,"Cute, spunky heroine","If you are looking for a strong heroine who is self-confident and would rather play sports than dress-up, this is the story for you!The main character, a girl fond of baseball and not afraid of getting dirty, finds herself the princess of a fairytale. Naturally, there is a prince running about attempting to be heroic (and failing). The 'princess' ends up solving most of the problems on her own and rescuing herself rather than waiting around for the prince (or another hero) to help her.Honestly, while I enjoy strong heroes, I found this one a bit too...feminist? And by that I mean that the prince is a stereo-type of the wimpy male who is both incompetent and cowardly. I don't think that a story needs to make men extremely weak in order to make the women look stronger.But that's my only quibble (and it's a minor one). This would be a fun adventure story for girls!"
1,Not compatible with Mac,"Hello,I'm really frustrated because I just bought M-Audio Torq Xponent and since in the description it says it works with Mac I bought it. I got it and I can't get my Mac to recognize the device because it's not compatible with ALL of OS's versions, specifically the latest one which is 10.7.4. You should specify this to customers, now I don't know what to do."
3,important info,"Nothing is more important than knowing about Depleted Uranium, but this dvd could be a little deeper.The shipper was fast, but this info can be seen online.I hope more and better DU movies come, soon, but at least, this is something about DU, now."
2,Williams is slumming it,"Williams's score for Revenge of the Sith is almost entirely overbearing, lacking any emotional subtlety. The music is overcomplicated and even a bit confusing, especially in the tracks that correspond to action sequences in the movie. His overuse of choral tracks and vocals is too bombastic and irritating to be listened to without the explosions and laser blasts of the soundtrack to soften them. (Yes, this music is actually softened by the sounds of warfare.) Worst of all, much of the music has simply been lifted from earlier scores. At times his self-imitation was so blatant that I actually wondered whether the editor who had complied this score had made a mistake and I was listening to The Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope. Also suffers from not including the entire score, in some cases cutting out musical segues in obvious and awkward ways."
3,Disappointing soundtrack to a GREAT movie.,"While the movie was great, this soundtrack does not hold up well on its own.The biggest problem is that it's not in chronological order. Soundtracks should have the score in the order it appears in the movie.The second problem is too much choral music. The LONDON VOICES are so overpowering that a little goes a long way, and there is certainly more than a little of them here.Also, there are too many boring tracks that don't do anything for me at all: Palpatine's Teachings, Padme's Ruminations and Anakin's Dark Deeds, to name 3. If you must buy this, like I did without listening to it first, pick it up at Target. It includes an extra CD of 13 tracks from all 6 movies."
3,I really wanted to like it...,"... but my reaction is pretty luke warm. Sure, there are some interesting moments but it mostly comes across as filler. Some really memorable themes would have been nice, or any even. ""Battle of the Heroes"" is the only thing that comes close -- minus the voices it sounds like Williams was going for something like a chant, perhaps ""Dies irae"". I like ""Palpatine's Teachings"" and ""Padme's Ruminations"" but not for their themes, just for the atmosphere. Compared to the scores from the original trilogy, giving this one three stars is generous. And the DVD is just dull. What I had hoped would be an in-depth look at Williams' composition process over the course of the six movies turned out to be nothing but a music video. Yawn. I'm going to give it more time but it will never be in the same class as Williams' best work."
5,Very serious encounter of the first degree in Brazil,"Two singers - Maria Bethnia and Gal Costa- and two composers/singers - Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso -- they were the main leaders and performers of the Brazilian cultural movement known as ""Tropicália"".This album is a rare show when they decided to play together with music and lyrics by Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil.It's a live recording with limited quality but it's a doc of an era, full of politics coded message.Maybe a disc for those who understand the Portuguese language and the political hints of those times."
4,Great series. Lots of Fan Service,"I really got a kick out of this series. It was fun and easy to follow. Great art, nice take on the comic. Overall I enjoyed this series a bunch."
1,Please do not subject your children to IMP,"I excelled in mathematics as an 8th grader. After 4 years of IMP, I did so poorly on a mathematics entry exam at UCLA that I was required to take a lower-level math course at a community college before I would be allowed into the math courses at UCLA. I went from receiving tropies at my middle school for top grades to barely scraping by with a C+ average in mathematics courses at UCLA. Luckily, I survived and worked my way into graduate school at Yale - no thanks to IMP."
2,Pastry Bag,I really wanted to like this bag and at first i thought I did as it is light weight and cleans very easily. But I have now used this bag 3-4 times and every time the bag leakes not out the top as that would be me but it actually leaks through the plastic and canvas making my hands very slick and hard to control the bag and what I am piping. I feel like I wasted my money!
5,Good pastry bag,"This is a good, all around pastry bag, and actually the first I have purchased or used. I used it to squeeze out dough into circles for a Paris-Brest cake. It functions well with nozzles alone, as we do not have one of those plastic adapters to switch nozzles with the same batch of gooey whatever. Caveat emptor: we bought the 21 inch... it is huge, and a little bit awkward to clean. Hot, soapy water, and turned inside out, however, and it gets clean quickly."
3,"Good, but not great.","This is probably Lynyrd Skynyrd's worst live album. The band sounds pretty uninspired here. But Skynyrd's worst is better than most band's best, so this is a worthwhile purchase for Skynyrd fans. Of particular note is an electric version of ""Devil In The Bottle"", which is almost a completely different song when compared to the acoustic version on Endangered Species. The rarely performed ""Down South Jukin'"" and ""Double Trouble"" shine here as well, with an extra solo at the end of the latter. ""T For Texas"" is another surprise, but it pales in comparison with the version on ""One More From The Road"". The band did sound pretty stale here, though that was remedied a year or so later with the addition of Ricky Medlocke and Hughie Thommason (check out Lyve From Steeltown for the definitive post-plane crash live album). Anyway, if you're a hardcore Skynyrd fan, buy this one. But don't set your expectations too high."
1,Who Wrote This?,"I'm usually a fan of Lori Foster's -- occasionally you just want to read something fun and rarely does she disappoint. However, after about 3 chapters of Jude's Law I had to flip to the front to check out the copyright -- I thought maybe it was a reprint of one of her very, very early books. The dialogue was ridiculous and reminded me of an unknown author's attempt at a Harlequin Romance book. It was also unbelievable that May's family would treat her as badly as they did and she just bravely smiled and stood by them because they're family, blah-blah-blah. Towards the end when one of the ""bad guys"" escapes and her idiot brother is as usual hysterical, it had to be explained to him what an APB (all points bulletin) was. Is there anyone alive that doesn't know what an APB is? The whole book was like this."
4,Home run,"Lori Foster delights us again with her writing skills. It's the not so typical story of a Hollywood hunk falling for a plus size woman. Got to love those underdog stories. And nobody tells them better than Foster. No folks, romance is not dead and when Foster writes them they absolutely sizzle."
1,bummed,"i loved Jude! May was super annying. i got to 43% and coulndt read anymore. I've read 4 lori foster books. this by far was the worst. it had such potential too!! i love the ""ultimate fighter"" background. this book just didnt do it. totally unbelievable!!"
3,Hmm....,"This was my first Lori Foster book, and it wasn't exactly bad, but I didn't love it either. The perks of the book is that the main character isn't the typical skinny girl, but a curvy 140lb woman. Also, the sex scenes were descriptive, passionate, and very straight forward, yet unconventional.I felt like the story was rushed, I felt like I missed something along the way. There wasn't enough time for the characters love to blossom and it was just sorta smashed together. I'm looking forward to reading other books of her."
1,?,I've read a couple of Lori Foster books and I've liked them. I couldn't finish this one. Just not worth the money.
5,A NECESSARY LOOK INTO CREATING A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP,"Trust can be the one factor that can bind or erode a couple's relationship. Dr. Block's excellent book confronts this issue by recognizing triggers that interfere and destroy that trust. Through the recognition of one's past and the learning to separate it from the present,as well as developing a more forthright style of communication, Dr. Block's book leads a couple in a most useful and positive direction that can only correct, improve, and enhance their chances for a successful relationship. An important book that is extremely instructive and useful for all couples to read. It is very highly recommended."
5,Within Temptation,"Love, love, love this album! It's creative and beautiful, not the typical lead singer is a chic rock band."
4,the heart of everything,"nice cd especially the track ""All I need"". sometimes a bit too heavy metal(for me). i prefer the more gentle melodies."
2,How to fall in love with your stalker,"This book really irked me. I hate that so many romance novels use the dumb-naive-bimbo-meets-stronger-older-man thing as their premise. Please! The so called hero of this book is a stalker and the woman at the heart of the story is a brainless twit. Not saying much considering she is supposed to be an early childhood educator.I wanted like this book as there are many Sandra Brown titles that are worth reading. Maybe it was because this was a reprint from the 80's. I don't know, but this book just never made it onto my radar. I couldn't find the book entertaining as it was just to silly to get into on any serious level. There are far better romances out there."
2,Words of silk,So happy she doesn't write like this any longer terrible read. Couldn't wait to finish. I'll be more selective next time
1,Silly & Simple- Don't Read,"That's all I can really say about this novel. SIMPLE! It doesn't deserves to get any stars. ZERO, NADA, NONE! Plot is weak, and very unrealistic, not to mention dated (I'm 26, but I can't imagine any woman falling for this caveman-stalker-bully even in the 80's) No way. If you're looking for a fast read, try The Rana Look or 22 Indigo Place. They have a little more depth."
4,Best emergency flashlight I have owned,"A little pricey, but this is the best emergency flashing out there -- primarily because it is rechargeable. You can just forget about worry about batteries."
3,great reference,this was helpful and i have shared with others who also purchased this item a must have if you are going to compete
5,Lovers together again!,"Chance Qualtrough is a woman's dream lover...caring and gentle, sexy, patient and determined to protect the woman he loves. It takes Hallie a while to realize this because she's running from real danger and is reluctant to drag Chance into her line of fire."
3,"Good story, but needs more background description","While this story was both interesting and entertaining, it could have been improved by a more detailed description of the setting. Nevada has several distinct characters - the highlands, the Mojave desert lands and the Great Basin valleys. The start of the book had me recalling blinding snowstorms I'd experienced out in the lonely sagebrush scrub, but later on, it became clear that Primrose Creek actually lay somewhere around Lake Tahoe, within easy reach of both Carson City and Reno. Unfortunately, that magnificent landscape - which could have become a major character in the novel - was never adequately described. Okay, the entire point of the book was to tell a love story (and it's probably too easy to criticise authors who've clearly sweated blood over their work), but I do believe that setting is important, especially when the author chooses a location as fabulous as small-town Nevada!"
1,Did Not Live Up to Expectations,"I received the Samsung T9 as a birthday gift, and after spending almost 8 hours struggling with trying to get it to run with music services (Rhapsody and Yahoo Music), I gave up. I was online and on the phone with technical support from Samsung, as well as Rhapsody, but could never get the device to be detected with either of the music services. I did find in Samsung's knowledgebase that they don't test this device with any music services to see if it works, but that it 'should' - and they market it with free trials of these services! Maybe they should try testing it, since that what most people would use it for.It was cool-looking, small and sleek, but if you're looking for using it with Rhapsody or Yahoo Music, I would try something else. I subsequently purchased the SanDisk Sansa e260R, and I love it. Also small and sleek, it installed seamlessly and worked right off the bat."
4,Old school,I have not heard this in 30 years but is was still just as funny. Nice mix of some favorites.
3,TEXASSHOPPER,"Mom's Mabley is an old school favorite - I regret not purchasing a DVD to see her in action - she is hard to understand on CD, particulary with the sound being not as advance back then as our technology is today. However, would recommend due to being a collector's item."
2,Seemed a little too cynical to me.,"I read this book as a young father and didn't get too much encouragement from of it. I loved Cosby's comic routines and the Cosby Show, but I guess I was expecting some deeper insights on fathering more than all the cynical humor about all the trouble kids cause their parents. I also wondered why the book needed a lengthy introduction and afterward by a Harvard psychiatrist. Dr. Poussaint seemed to be trying to salvage Cosby's content with some expert professional advice on raising kids. Not that this advice was any more helpful, but I would rather have had it from from Cosby himself, in his own words and experience, than from an academic."
5,Superb,"I received the package faster than I anticipated and holy cow I enjoyed the book to the core. Bill Cosby is a Genius, very insightful & funny writer. Thanks Amazon for creating this platform for people who can't afford the cost of a new book to buy the the used ones at a low price . Keep the good work going"
4,Classic Book for All New Dads,"Some of the humor is getting a little worn, but this is still the classic funny book for all new Dads, written in a warm and easy-to-read style for the average joe Dad and the Dad with 2 college degrees. If you're looking for something that goes a little deeper, try, ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler, which I found the most hilarious, roller-coaster and emotionally rewarding book on what being a Dad and a man is all about. Chapter on taking four kids to the ladies' room is a classic!"
3,"Good, but I've heard it before","While Cosby's stories are funny, many of them are reworks of his standup skits. It is a quick, easy read and had me laughing out loud at times but I wish it had more new material. If you know his standup well, skip the book; the standup delivers the material better. If you don't, by all means enjoy! Also, pass on the forward and the afterward commentary. It has nothing to do with the book but instead is Dr. Poussaint working out childhood demons and lecturing us against being a traditional parent."
5,Extremely Durable,"These batting gloves are the best gloves ever. They might not be the best looking for design, but they last forever! I like to wear my gloves even when running bases so I don't scrap up my hands when I'm sliding, and all other gloves that I've had before tore up really easily. The last pair that I had lasted about 2 years when most other gloves I had didn't even make it a full season. I will continue to get these until they stop making them or if someone finally makes something even better (which is doubtful)."
5,Hands on grammar!,"I have many grammar activity books, but this is definitely the best! It includes many ideas for learning grammar in a way kids don't even realize they are learning because they are having so much fun doing them! For example, my students loved to make ""animal prepositional poems"". I had another teacher borrow the book, and she bought it herself! With this book you are teaching quality not quantity."
3,So-so quality,"One of the most affordable 19"" LCD monitors around, this Acer flat screens has average image quality and performance. Don't be fooled by the ""fast 16ms response time"" marketing talk. Most decent LCD monitors these days have 16ms response time. The Acer has only so-so image quality. Text is not as crisp as on better brands like Sharp or NEC. Colors are a bit washed out but still acceptable. Brightness is lower than most recent LCD monitors, and the 140"" viewing angle is narrower than today's typical 160"". In short, you are getting a value-oriented LCD monitor which won't disappoint you most of the time. But if you demand excellent image, go with a Sharp or NEC or Mitsubishi or even a Sceptre (a relatively new brand, also sold here on amazon).E-mail me if you have any LCD questions and I'll see if I can help."
4,Good insights,"Good use of Infancy Gospels. Teachings on ""Self-responsability, and Spiritual progression through the life of CHRIST.A blessed work indeed."
4,Great Story,"For anyone who is a history buff, the question that jumps around in all our minds is ""What if"". This is a great story that uses American historical figures and heroes as the source of most of the characters, which gives it familiarity but also thoroughly develops their character from what we know from history and attempts to predict what they would have done in this situation. I was wishing the story would continue at the end."
2,Obscure Paintings of the Hudson River School,"This book is a reprint of a 1978 exhibition catalogue of one person's private collection. There is a short (7 page) essay at the beginning which gives an overview of the Hudson River School. The rest of the book consists of illustrations of around 60 paintings, each by a different artist. Most of the artists are obscure, while the well-known painters (Bierstadt, Church, Cole) are not represented by their best works.If you want an in-depth study of the Hudson River School with illustrations of its best paintings, this is not the book for you."
5,Contains rare single-only tracks!,"Contains the track Single Girl plus 3 non-LP tracks - exclusive to this single! The songs are: Pudding, Demystification and Shut Up."
1,This broke immediately,"I maybe used this for a month. It started cracking from the fattest part of the bottom, as did the soap dispenser."
3,"good economy gate, with limitations","I have two in my household to block with gates; my 16 mo. old daughter and my Siberian husky. I've been glad these are inexpensive, my Siberian husky chewed one down to nothing. We were finding splinters from that gate everywhere!I've not been able to afford a pricier gate (I think I need an all-metal one!). This has been OK so far for my use. One limitation that's been even harder to work with than my dog chewing up the gate has been my 6 yr old daughter. My 9 yr old is tall enough to step over it, as I do. My six yr old is not, and I'm afraid she's going to try and end up falling. She lacks the strength to pull the bar up and take the gate down to go through.As to her little sister, yes, it works good for keeping her where she's supposed to be. But it's been a bit challenging to work around the problems, so I'm shopping for another gate."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste any money on this type of gate. Spend a 'little' more and get a plastic pressure-resistant gate or one that affixes to the wall. They are too hard to get locked into position and if your walls are not even, then forget it."
1,VERY DANGEROUS! WATCH OUT!,"Our extended family was renting a home on a weekend vacation and we asked the owner to get a gate for his large staircase. He purchased this one- we were disappointed because we had tried it at home and our 18-month old was able to push it over with no problem. Needless to say, we knew that we couldn't depend on it and chose a bedroom downstairs in the house to be safe. We started unpacking the car and my mother-in-law said she'd watch my now 20-month old son while I brought something downstairs. When I got to my room, I heard the gate go tumbling down the stairs. I freaked out and when I got to the stairs, there was my son, along with the gate, screaming. THANK GOD, he was not hurt at all. Honestly, I think it was a miracle. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS GATE-- DO NOT DEPEND ON IT IF YOU ARE USING IT TO PREVENT A FALL DOWN THE STAIRS."
1,Looks good but does not work as it should,"I bought two of these thinking that since they were simple cassette recorders they should work OK. They both shut off when in the record mode without coming to the end of the tape because the ""end of tape"" auto shut off operates. I have had them for over a year and during the year the manufacturer gave me several tips on how to get them to operate properly but none of them helped. I used to be a electronic designer and an electronic repair technician for consumer electronic equipment and I feel that for both of these units they must have design defects. The manufacturer refuses to repair them since the short warranty period is over. I feel they should have in my case since I have two units in hand both have the exact same problems from day one and they are not related to any ""wear and tear"" on the product. I normally do not write any reviews but since I am so insulted by the manufacturer I have written this one."
2,good for about 2 months.....,"granted i'm detailing cars everyday, however, the metal that holds the bristles broke at the base near the pastic. this is allowing only 2 of the curved bristles to do the work and it is not adequate....this is a decent product for a 1-4 x a month carwasher...not an everyday detailer..."
3,It does work!,"First off, you wouldn't believe the amount of brake pad dust that can accumulate on and around the lug nuts. So yes, that brush has a purpose and it is not a dumb useless gadget. I love mine. But, I find that after only a few uses, the bristle flattens very quickly. If anyone has tried a different model with better quality bristle, please post a comment."
4,Great band,"Great band! Catchy tunes, great lyrics. If you are into bands like weezer, the rentals, ozma, or the anniversary, you will like this band."
2,Not what I expected,"My son lost his compass. Obviously, it was a toy, but replicated the compass Jack Sparrow used in the movie and was something he was very fond of. I bought this to replace the lost compass; however, like the last reviewer, I found out it was BLOCKS on Christmas morning. I was very, very disappointed with this purchase. The description says nothing about it being blocks. I wanted a compass, not blocks.If you are looking for blocks, I'm sure this toy will suit you, but I give it bad reviews because it was not what I expected."
5,Reed & Baton Flatware Chest,Great Product (The wife is happy!). Solid & very elegant looking. The flatware chest came on time and was well packaged. I would deal with this company again.Reed & Barton Bristol Flatware Chest
2,Reed & Barton Bristol Flatware Chest,"The exterior of the Reed & Barton Bristol Flatware Chest was in good condition. However, the slide-out drawer would not work. I finally got it loose and the wood was raw and untreated in order to make it slide. I had to wax all of the surfaces that the drawer contacted. It still didn't slide very smoothly, but I kept the chest.I'm wondering if these items are ""seconds"", and hesitate to order from vendors through Amazon.com"
3,There is potential for this series to be a favorite,"This is my first Peter Diamond novel and although I had a rather difficult time becoming engaged with his character and the story, I did manage to finish the book and enjoyed it. I like that Diamond searches long and hard to find the guilty party, even after he realizes that he was responsible for having the wrong person convicted. In parts he is a bit too ""old school"" for me (turns his nose up at the value of computers, for example) but I think it's part of his curmudgenly persona.The town of Bath provides a great background for the mystery surrounding a murder, leading to another murder and a kidnapping."
2,Doesn't look like the picture,"I ordered item according to image shown. The teaspoons are not nearly as long, nor do they look like image. They have a very cheap design on bottom of handle, which you can't see on image. The price was cheap but shipping cost more than item. Can't return item because shipping would then be twice the price of item. It will probably go in garbage."
2,Not as advertised,"These spoons were not the same brand advertised and, of course, not the same pattern. Bought them trying to support a US company but labeled China. Quality is OK, especially considering the price. ( Price should have indicated to me not to expect too much.)"
3,Fog lights,The lights were a high quality product. My only problem is a rock broke A lense and I can not find a replacement. I have searched Amazon and have tried [...]got nowhere.
1,An extreme disappointment,"I cannot recommend this book. It is very basic, poorly laid out and the index is very poor. Just as an example, one of the many weaknesses is the poor treatment of plant depreciation. Three pages contain a very padded discussion of straight line versus Interest and depreciation methods without any discussion of their relative merits or fields of application. More seriously, there is no good data on the actual inputs to be used in the methods, eg economic life of plant etc. This is typical of the book, only the trivial aspects of estimating are covered."
5,Great Photos: Moving and passionate presentation.,"The pictures in this book capture the pain and the joy of the efforts behind the UFW. And what's more, it captures a piece of history that many would rather ignore. You deserve to know the truth. Many of your neighbors probably care more about the people who empty their trash! What do you know about the people who pick the food you eat?"
1,False Advertising,"I ordered it and they shipped me something else with the excuse that LifeStyles no longer makes this product. If so, why do you state that you still sell it? I would recommend not buying anything from this company."
1,It stopped working :-(,"It doesn't work anymore :-( It stopped after 6 months of working fine. In general I was happy, but now I'm sad that I can't find the solution. No fuse is broken, just it doesn't work, no support from the vendor."
1,Broke the day after,My 3 year old was so excited when opened this for Christmas. Unfortunately only lasted a day. May aswell be thrown now. Disappointed as he enjoyed it to start with
1,How do these people sleep at night?,"This is a horrible product. When I opened the box, I just disappointed at how small the claws looked (I had bought two of them). When I picked them up, I was even more disappointed at how cheap they felt (and I paid $10 each). When I turned them over, I became angry when I discovered that both of the toys were broken. I don't blame the packaging - I blame the product.This product symbolizes how our society is regressing for the almighty dollar. Companies make a cheap product and expect us to pay a higher price for it. The hit to your reputation is worth more than the expenses you save in production."
2,Save Your Money,"Save your money. This toy is a piece of junk. Micheal""s Craft Store had just about the same item for $1.00!!!!!!"
3,"decent first novel, nothing more","I bought this book based on the glowing reviews on the cover, but found it fell somewhat short of expectations. Aside from the fact that Billingham has made the goal of the serial killer slightly different than usual, and puts us into the head of an immobilized victim kept on life support, there is really nothing new here. The frequent use of British slang and references to British pop culture may make it a bit difficult for the American reader, though I don't hold it against him. The final chapter *is* heartbreaking, though, and is likely to haunt you far more than the rest of the novel."
5,2nd Thorne novel for me - looking forward to continuing in the series,"Excellent mystery writing and character development. Very original story line.As a side note, I don't recommend the TV show on this though - they just don't seem to do these books justice in my opinion (though being from across the pond, its interesting to see the city/country - and the actor playing Thorne is right on)Look forward to the next Tom Thorne - novel."
3,An OK novel,"I personally thought it was kind of middle of the road. It's true that 'Sleepyhead' is an easy read, the writing wasn't particularly spectacular. I liked the usage of British vernacular and pop culture references. I am a little bias because references were made about places that I have actually visited in London. I guess my main gripe is that the writing was a bit too simple. I liked Thorne's character and the 'internal' dialog of Alison Wiletts. With that said, I would still consider reading other works by Billingham, I wasn't completely discouraged."
4,I really like this author,"This was a very good book, I enjoyed it. It's too bad the TV show writers didn't read the book first."
3,"Good First Effort, But Ending was Disappointing","Normally I would give this a four-star rating, but after wading through 400 pages, I found that the bad guy wasn't a very worthy character. I won't say any more, but the ending left me unsatisfied. However, the rest of the book was well-done and the characters very well described, in most cases. The book is full of distractions and tricks to lead you (and Detective Inspector Thorne) off the track. And the dialog, particularly that of ""locked in"" victim Alison Willets, was very well executed. I like Billingham as a writer and will read his other works. As I say, the only flaw -- and not a bad one at that -- was the ending. But I still would recommend the book."
1,"Still a snoozer, not worth the money","I wrote a steaming review of this document several years ago. Apparently, Amazon.com decided a new edition deserved a clean slate.I've seen the newest edition. It's no better than the old one. It's more or less a sales pitch but you pay for it. It's a brochure project from Advertising 101 class that deserves a D."
4,Actually fits hampers,"These bags are nice because they actually have the stretch to fit over hampers. Any other non-mesh laundry bags I have tried don't have the extra stretch to go over the edges and stay on. I just bought #3 and #4 (2 more mesh bags finally died) and I noticed this time that they are 100% polyester. I thought they were cotton... I associated ""jersey"" with the cotton jersey bed sheets (basically what you get)... I guess I assumed with the first 2 and forgot to check. The cats of the bag now. Still nice bags but I was looking for cotton :-/"
3,Good Condition,I didn't have anything wrong to say about the seller. Its the manufacturer whom I would like to get on. this book was delivered on time like it was supposed to. I thought it was a shop repair manual but its still gives you more than enough information than a owners manual.
3,poor music,"I found the music very distracting, almost like a whale in distress.I enjoyed the doctor's voice & what he said, but the talking meditation was not long enough for me. I bought this tape to help me go to sleep, but at the end of the talking, you are guided to open your eyes & to be awake. The music which was was not relaxing to me, continued after & I always had to turn it off. Thumbs up for the doctor's part of this relaxation, sleep, meditation cd."
1,SAMPLE MISLEADING,"When I listened to the sample, I was impressed. But after hearing the whole CD I returned it. Mr. Hardin over emphasizes (for lack of better description) his s' and c's which is very distracting. Also, I was expecting the sound of a stream of water (Drifting Downstream)for the musical part, but it wasn't. It was a horrible pounding noise. I don't know, may be I just got a bad cd. But is was not relaxing for me."
5,Great book,"If you're interested in the universe and music and math and all that that pertains too, purchase this book."
4,Care bears,"These are nice. Our daughters love them. Safe and durable. Very, very fun. Glad we got them for our two girls. They always play with them."
1,Disappointed Due to Inadequate Description,"The description of this item, here and on the manufacturer's website, is inadequate for determining if the pads will fit your particular trailer/jacks:Pack of 46"" diameter padsFor use on Light Trailer Stabilizing JacksReading this one would think these pads fit any light trailer jack.Unfortunately, it will cost you 8 bucks (return postage) if you guess wrong.The photo is inaccurate as well. The actual item is painted black."
4,Musically complex,"I enjoy listening to music, partly because I enjoy discovering the rhythms and patterns. ""One Mother"" was a special treat -- on almost every track, just when I thought I could anticipate where she was going next, Kathi took it in a new direction. I wouldn't term it consistent, because the music did NOT do the same thing over and over. I found myself listening very intently, trying to anticipate, and being surprised when I guessed wrong.I look forward to her next release!"
2,waste of money,I get these socks because as a massage therapist it is more comfortable to work with barefeet but that isn't always acceptable. So when I got these I was excited but that was short lived. Ther was a loose string hamging from one sock and I cut it not thinking anything would happen but to my surprise half of the sock came undone. Now for the money one would think that cutting a loose string would destroy the whole sock but it did.
3,Didn't Work For My Feet,I really appreciate that they have large sizes for men's big feet. My problem was that the toe sizes were still too narrow. Also the length of the smaller three toes of the socks was much longer than my actual toes so they rolled under my feet.
2,Not as good as my last pair....,I have always loved ToeSox but the two pairs that I purchased this time are very uncomfortable. The toe in-seams are too long so they cut into the soft tissue between each of my toes...gradually getting worse as I workout. I would send them back but have worn and washed them now... I wonder whether these were seconds or not. I can't recommend these socks unless you have very long toes...!!
2,Socks Don't Last,"I thought these socks would be a good alternative to going barefoot in the gym during my son's family karate practice. The practice involves basic moves and is not highly physical with jumping or spinning, but the rubber no-slip buttons on the bottom do not last. Just walking on the gym floor causes them to come off the fabric. He used them maybe twice, and hasn't used them since. I found a nice pair of Pine Tree Martial Arts Shoes that are very comfortable and more durable, although more expensive. The shoes were a much better choice for this activity, and would work even for other types of exercise. I would have to say the socks are good for home on the carpet if you want them to last, but for that there are cheaper and softer choices than these that will last.http://www.amazon.com/Pine-Tree-Martial-Arts-Shoes/dp/B0086OKWL4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1354903814&sr;=8-1&keywords;=pine+tree+karate+shoes"
4,Worth the money,"My ToeSox arrived quickly and fit like a glove...which, they basically are. The construction is pretty good and the little grippers on the bottoms of the feet and toes are exactly what you need to keep your feet from wanting to slide off the mat. Plus, they keep my feet warm, which is a great bonus!"
3,Don't read more than Half of this book,The first half of this book gives good formulas and visual aids...The second half starts to psycho bable nonsence....Don't buy this book unless you are good at sorting through useful and un-useful info
5,Martini glasses,Great design. Different markings help keep track of whose glass it is. Great price. Knock off of more expensive version.
3,Helpful,"This book is jammed packed with helpful phrases and information, but it is a bit difficult to use on-hand when needed. The list of household words I find to be incomplete and there are many scenarios for which I could not locate the correct phrase. All in all it is better to have it then not to have it, but it could be improved upon."
3,Just okay,"I thought this would be more of an intimate perspective. It's good for people that know absolutely nothing about what happened, but it is very pro-Catholic, and ushers non-believers into Catholicism."
2,Weak suction power!,This model is only useful for vacuuming dust and very small crumbs. The vent placement is poorly designed because it blows stuff all over the place. Battery life is not all that great either. If you are going to use this type of vacuum cleaner daily a seriously suggest to invest more money into it.
1,Worst Product I Have Ever Bought,"I must say, without reservation, that this is absolutely among the WORST products I have ever purchased.I went for the cheap cordless handvac, and cheap is what I got.Absolutely no suction power and the battery is gone in less than 5 minutes.A total piece of trash."
4,sushi maker,Great service. Arrived on time & as described. Haven't used it yet but that's my problem.
4,Alot of fun and easy to use.,"I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it says you can make sushi with this without using Nori. When we tried it without the Nori, it fell apart...yes we were using the correct rice and it is very sticky. However, with the Nori to help hold it all together, we have made many delicious sushi rolls."
5,LOVE THIS GADGET!,"Could not wait to get this. We love eating nigiri sushi. It takes me forever making the rice rolls. This unique item makes it easy for creating rice rolls. At first I pressed too hard and flattened out everything. LOL! But, I got the hang of it and I could whip out a sushi meal in no time. The roller for making rolls is much easier than wrapping bamboo in plastic wrap. Clean-up is easy as well. This is a must-have for the sushi lover!"
3,"Quirky Thriller , satisfies but has holes","This book has the plot tension to be a great thriller, but falls short. The protagonist is not a likable person, who abandons his family. The book moves rapidly enough to keep your attention. But in the end leaves you feeling empty."
4,"Not his best, but I liked it","This was a quick, enjoyable read, but it is readily apparent that this was his first novel. It pulls too heavily from other sources and doesn't have deLint's distinctive voice that make his later stories so spell-binding."
2,Not really that good,"I mean, the songs are so dull and not at all heavy. Why did Nuclear blast sign them?"
2,Dull,"I was hoping for some gripping tales of cads, bounders and scofflaws; what I got instead was some vague writing about people the author thinks are are cool. Granted, Mr. Whitbley's enthusiasm is a little infectious, but he persistently fails to deliver the goods, viz. why these people are cool in the first place. If you're looking for a rollicking good time, try Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle or the Flashman series by George Macdonald Fraser instead."
4,Ghetto Gold &Platimun Respect,"Mad Lion is the first to combine the two musics such as hip hop and reggae. Since Mad Lion has stepped on the set, there have been alot of copy cats. I feel that Nervours Records didn't get Mad Lion the propor promtions and marketing he really needed to compete with the rest of the hip hop artist at the time of his releases. Lion should be a super star like all the other artist that came out around 1993 and 1994. It's a same that some artist that have a large following have to remain undergroud. Big up your chest Mad lion cause the real reconize the real. Lick mad shoots."
4,Not bad . . .,"Zak and Tash ""rest"" on the planet Dantooine, where their uncle Hoole takes notes on the natives that live there. Tash has a dream about the dark side of the Force and she begins to use the Force for evil. When Hoole, Zak, and Tash run into another adventure, Tash must choose between the light or the dark side. The outcome really surprised me!"
4,"Not Really A Hits Album, But Still Great!","It may look like a hits album to some, but this set of cuts from three latter-day Madness albums is a must-have for fans who can't get the originals or want one great set to complement their first and second albums (which are also out on CD). In any case, it's a great place to hear ""Michael Caine"" (featuring the noted thespian himself), the incredibly poppy and fresh ""Our House"", the gospel-tinged ska-workout of ""Wings Of A Dove"", the kinetically constructed ""Victoria Gardens"" and ""I'll Compete"", as scathing an attack against (for?) the vagaries of the music biz as one could ask for from these punk survivors. So don't dump on this one 'coz it doesn't have ""Night Boat To Cairo"" or ""One Step Beyond"" on it. Instead, revel at their incredible pop smarts and give it righteous marks for originality, invention and hook-filled toons that stick in your mind long after the CD's ended. A winnah!"
4,Excellent except for one thing...,"I just got this player today and this is a fantastic unit capable of nearly every possible feature your full-sized DVD home theater player can do except one very important thing (to me)...it doesn't appear to have a ""Random"" or ""Shuffle"" option for audio CDs/MP3 CD/DVDs. So when you put a DVD in there with 1200 MP3s on it, it will start on track 1 every time - no way to make it random. This is a huge oversight in my opinion. If I'm somehow missing how to do this - please email me at [...]because I cannot find the option anywhere within the unit menus or the manual."
1,A star for Morris Chestnut,"Yup , I am only giving this play 1 star because Morris was in it. The characters are so flat and bland, the play lacks a foundation and substantial plot. Eye candy is about the only positive with this movie, found myself fast forwarding throughout just to skip over the overdramatized singing solos. This was a waste of my time. It was wack wack wackitty wack. The end."
2,Well...,"I had listen to some of the tracks and fortunately I knew someone who owned it and borrowed it off them, well Orbital is an unusual choice it is an ok song although arnt they ambient? New Order shows its usual icy sound and well the rest of disk one is chock a block full of good to bad sounds. If theres one thing I noticed theres no Stabbing Westward or NIN on here oh well. Meat Beat Manifesto makes a good contribution. The only thing that made me hate this set was disk three. Dont get me wrong I love industrial but this disk 3 was terrible, the sound was cheap and didnt have any POWER. A good collection somewhat marred. If you want a really good compilation get something like the Black Bible or Music of the Shadows volume 3."
1,A Terrible Hand-Vac,"The old Dirt Devils that I used to own were awesome - they would last forever even when taking lots of abuse. So I bought this updated one with high hopes. What a mistake! The biggest problem is that the agitator brush is air-powered, rather than electric or belt powered. Consequently, the brush stops turning whenever it hits anything soft (high carpet, plush upholstery) and is even less likely to turn if the filter is clogged up from cleaning. Time to find a new hand-vac manufacturer..."
3,Effective and Worth the Money.,"I admit that I only bought this item for house cleaning but I have had no problems with it. I had a lady bugs all over my cottage and I brought it there and it sucked them all up without difficulty. The same can be said of dust, spider webs, dirt, and just about everything else on the floor. I thought it a good, but I admit to having no industrial purposes for it."
1,Blows more dirt around than it picks up,"I was initially disappointed in this unit's awkward design and heaviness. I was thoroughly disgusted, however, when I tried to use it on our staircase: it blows so much air out the back I could see the dust and dirt whirl far away even as I tried to vacuum it up. It really has no extra ""reach"" via its hose because if you turn it around to get the benefit of the length of the hose, that blast of exhaust air is aimed even more accurately at whatever you were trying to clean. Ridiculous!! This vac is a design disaster."
1,Dirt Devil Doesn't Suck...and that is the Problem,"After years of good performance our old hand held vacum with a rotating brush finally died. We looked all over for a new model with a rotating brush and we found few models available. We purchased the Dirt Devil Power Reach.We have had this vacum a year and use it rarely.... usually on stairs. Well, the brushes now stop rotating the minute we set the vacum down on ANY surface.. carpet, linoleum, etc... It still sucks, but without the rotating brushes it is almost not worth using. Avoid this model and buy a handheld vacum that really sucks."
1,I'd say it sucks...,"But that'd be a compliment. I got one of these as a gift to use on stairs, couches, and corners my upright doesn't reach. The body of the machine is bulky and difficult to handle. The beather head rarely spins freely or at an effective speed, regardless of how clean the head is and whether it's touching something. The hose that allows you to remove the beater head and attach a crevice tool to is too short. The vents on the body of the vacuum blow dirt away from the hose when you try to use it. The vacuum also spins around and doesn't sit upright if you attempt to let go of the handle while using the hose attachments. The hose is clogged about 95% of the time, even if I'm trying to suck up sand or something fine.This is really one of the most impressively designed machines I've ever used. It's terrible. The long cord is great, but what good is that if you can't use the vacuum??"
1,Very Poor Design,"I've had the unit for under a month and only used it a few times. The rollerbrush failed to turn after a few uses. Long story, but talked to an ""authorized repair center"" and was told that the rollerbrush design is junk. They had 5 units in for ""repair"" just this week. The shaft gets clogged with lint and the rollerbrush stops turning. Even talked to Dirt Devil ""Corporate"" and was told that there was nothing they would do. Looks like I'm out $40. Dirt Devil won't get my business again."
2,"I agree with everybody else, pointless beater bar","I am not usually prompted to write reviews, as a matter of fact, this is my first. This thing is pointless. The beater bar doesn't do a darn thing. This thing really is mediochre at best, it doesn't really do anything well."
1,Should have read the reviews first,I made the mistake of buying this without reading the reviews first. I bought this because I wanted a hand vac with a revolving brush to vacuum my stairs. The problem is the brush stops revolving when it comes in contact with the carpet. What's the point? I took it back to the store the next day.
5,very happy with Amazon.com and Dirt Devil,"I was completely satisfied with my Amazon.com purchase and delivery and performance of a Dirt Devil vacuum cleaner. I'm a very busy single mom, working two jobs and I just don't have time to run to the store to shop. This is soooo wonderful! I saw a piece on CNN about how Amazon.com operates and decided to give it a try, and I LOVED it! Thank you so much. This is a wonderful blessing and help to families like me."
3,DIRT DIRT DIRT,"LOTS OF POWER , GREAT FOR SHORT CARPET IN MY BOAT, BRUSH WILL STOP TURNING EASY ON CARPET IN THE HOUSE ,BURBER CARPET MAYBE OK."
1,Bad reprint,"Excessively bad reprint of that valuable 1975 pocket dictionary all tattered and torn that I wished to replace by a fresh copy. No way, this one is looking like a blurry photocopy of the original book. One cannot tell a gimel from a nun and so forth. Almost useless. I'll continue to consult the old and tattered one. Shame on the publishers."
3,Goodbye to All That,I thought this book was going to be about the state of British culture which caused the war (WWI) to be fought poorly and the further degeneration caused by the war itself. I can't say where I got that idea. But the book was actually just a memoir about the author's experiences in the war. He describes how bad it all was but does not really make any judgments. It's an interesting book but anything special.
2,a bit disappointing,"Disclaimer: I normally love all of Victoria's workouts, and have most of her DVD's. This one, however, did not come close to living up to her usual ones. It's an entire floor workout, and there's just way too much talking. I've done some great ab workouts where you mix it up and do some standing up, so this was just boring.Sorry!"
1,Editing?,"There is quite a bit of information in this book but no one ever read it. The letter h is printed as li, U could be ll, R is almost always E as in Eobert. It is interestingly odd to read, like reading a cipher. It must have been scanned by a digital reader, but please, look at it before you charge me $6 for it. It is frequently illegible."
2,Disappointment is the name of the game,"This film, obviously based upon Ayn Rand's book of the same name, is an extreme disappointment.It might be worth [something], but nowhere near [what]I paid for it.It leaves out almost everything that made the book a vivid portrait of extreme hardship and poverty."
2,Poor subtitles...,I was deeply disappointed in a poor subtitle job which made it very difficult to read. White letters on a white background are illegible!
2,Badly Written,"After reading this book, I found it hard ot imagine it was written by a grown man. It has less literary value than the vandalism of derranged lunatics inside the stall of highway service station rest rooms.If you're looking for a book on the Congo, which I reccommend, as it has a sad, yet fascinating history, I reccoment ""The Poisonwood Bible""."
3,Not the Lennons,"Fans of the California group, Venice, featuring members of the Lennon family, be warned, this is a different group. It's a Scandanavian quartet and the CD is less than a half-hour long. That being said, it's kind of intriguing, sort of a combination of Midge Ure and U2, though they evidently went on to the ""V's"" for the group name. Probably not the style that US-Venice fans are looking for, but not bad, with some retro-'60's organ riffs thrown in."
1,Worst ever!,"Thought I would save a few dollars and bought this piece of junk for our lake cabin. If anything could go wrong, it did. Handle breaks easily. Nothing stays on board. Suction horrible. Hoses stretch out of shape after just a few uses. Belt slips and burns. Tips over VERY easily. Incredibly loud. Filter is useless. Worst purchase I have ever made. Spend the money and get something that will function and last! I can't even give this 1 star but had no other option. Would have used a negative if I could."
4,cool,I love this series. It is such a girl series that I introduced my neices to it. I was finally able to complete my box set.Pearl
2,Not a big fan,I am not an action game fan but I still wanted to give it a try based on the great reviews. Well I was not thrilled with the game. Only played it a few times and then gave it to a friend. He liked it more than me.
3,Steath fighting.,"From the viewpoint of never having played any of these Metal Gear games, it was mixed in terms of enjoyment.This is definitely an infiltration into enemy territory type game. Hide, calm down and regenerate turned into break time to avoid using health supplies. Not a direct shooting game like Resistance. The concept of stress on combat and the camouflage suit gave the game an unexpected plus. Solid game mechanics. Good weapons. This gives the 4 star rating.But without the deeper story as this game expects you to know already, as going through the missions, something was always missing. The cut scenes were amazing in terms of graphics but and there is the but: You are expected to know a lot of the interactions between people and background. So this brought it down to a 3.Great but missing something was the feeling throughout the game. Even going to the wiki site to read some background, it only filled it somewhat."
2,Numerous and long cut scenes..,"I had never played Metal gear solid so I did not know the story line. I went about going by the reviews on different sites and all were going ""ga-ga"" ""5 stars"" etc. That made me look at this game with interest. It started with a long movie which I had to cut in the middle. When the game play started I really liked it. But I completed the mission in 5 minutes and then again another 10 minute movie started. It started becoming irritating. This could have been such a great game but the creators were busy placating the MGS fans by finishing off a story and tying things up. In a way the game is fun to play while it lasts but the frequent appearance of movies (some very emotional like ""Marry me"" ""Don't cheat"" kind of stuff) put me off. The guns are fun, the enemies easy to kill. Finished it off in two days.Not recommended for people who have not played MGS before."
4,"Fun game, but too much cinematic","Simple as that. Often times in-game you take a few steps only to watch a cinematic. Take a couple more, another cinematic.Gameplay is fun, you are just inandated with long...long....long sequences of video. Between campaigns there is almost 30 mins of cinematic. At least you can skip through them. I get about 10-15 mins in, occasionally I've watched the entire thing, but I end up skipping. I bought the game to shoot stuff.Overall, its a pretty good game despite its long videos. The fact that you can skip them and get to the makes up for that flaw, but keeps this review from 5 stars."
2,a huge disappointment,"I picked up this game when it first came out in the ps3 bundle, because I was a big mgs fan. I really dug the first play through, but hated the ending. Then I immediately played through it again, and the second time was nothing but disappointed in the lack of actual substance the game had. I didn't like most of the changes it made to the formula, because they took the game away from the entire style that made it metal gear solid in the first place. Not that I am against innovation, but the game is not innovative in its own sense either, it just takes ideas from other genres and implements them clumsily into places they don't fit. On top of that, I recently tried booting it up again, and the cinematics are just awkward, stiff and long winded. If you want a cinematic experience on the ps3, go for the Uncharted franchise."
1,Big disapointment.,"The people giving this game good reviews, did they even play it?Worst game I have ever played. WTF! It took 30 minutes of cut scenes that did even make sense just to die over and over again. What's up with the ""talk show"" video scene? The ""fried egg"" scene? A video of someone cracking eggs over a pan. Yes, this is what you will see in the first 15 minutes of playing, and it goes on and on. The developers must be on crack!The game itself is boring. Sneaking around and getting killed if you get caught. Sloppy game controls, tap X to crouch, hold X to lie down. Hold X again to stand up. You will find that in a confrontation you are end up crawling on the ground when you're trying to run.The animation of solid snake is terrible. Who wants to run around looking at a hunch back from behind?Buy ""Gears of War"" for Xbox 360, or buy a PC and play real games."
1,If you like B-Movies,"check out some of the cable channels or HBO re-runs. If you're looking for a video game, look somewhere else. Graphics are nice but that's it. After 15-30 Minutes you will be so bored you just want it to be over.Overall game play is very repetitive, the story dumb and the cut-scenes are just neverending. Don't get me wrong, I loved most of the other MGS titles but this time it's not much playing but a lot of watching. If this is the kind of video game experience you enjoy, you might want to consider. If you like to use the controller at all, stay away.Funny enough, the guys at the local store of a big video game store franchise praised it all over. At least I was able to get some trade value after 5 days and I learned this lesson: Don't ever listen to the guys at the large chains.Biggest PS3 disappointment so far."
2,SNAKEEEEEE!!,so i have a pre-used PS3 not the problem though. been looking forward to this one game and it wont play it past a certain level. i cant watch the cut scenes without it telling me the disc can't be read. i have no problems with ANY other games
4,complicado,"el juego es bueno pero muy complicado el manejo del control para realizar las actividades del personaje, son demasidos comandos que interfieren con un adecuado juego ya que se distrae la atencion en como usar el control para desempeño del personaje, viene en español"
2,One big smoking ad.,"The graphics are really good and the game play is excellent. The number of video stories got boring after awhile. While the game was installing it subjects you to one long smoking ad. Throughout the game it makes you watch him smoke several times and even rewards you for smoking. At first the balance between videos and game play was about right. As the game progresses it gets unbalanced, the videos get longer and the game play gets shorter. I really enjoyed the game while I was able to play, but after awhile I found that I spent almost as much time skipping story videos as I did getting to play. In the end I gave up playing because it became tedious and boring."
1,"No fun, no gameplay.","MGS4 offered about 30 minutes of actual playtime in the three hours I ""played"" it before returning it. The rest of the time I watched boring cinematics that had too much unnecessary information. The gameplay of this title was fairly boring, with several of the levels being less than 1 minute long before another extremely long cutscene.Cutscenes aside, this game really had nothing to offer me by way of gameplay. Sneaking is really not necessary in this game as blasting your way through the few enemies you find is far easier than trying to run around them.Ultimately, this game is geared toward extremely hard-core Metal Gear fans. If you aren't one of those, then I would suggest disregarding the hype and picking up another title."
2,Boring!!,"I must be missing something! This game takes forever (which I usually like) but for every 5 minutes you actually play, you are put through 30 minutes of drawn out long winded boring cinematics! At one point I forgot to save so I had to re-play about an hour of the game, skipping the cinematics that hour took less than five minutes!!! And the names? Big Boss? Big Momma? Zero? And about six different Snake characters... D- for effort on naming...I have finished the game since posting this first review, total time of gameplay was 24 hours... So I played it again, this time skipping 95% of the cinematics, total time of gameplay.... 8 HOURS!!!"
4,An excellent end to a saga,"I am a huge MGS fan and have been since the early days. I do not own a PS3, I borrowed it from my buddy just for this experience, but I have to say that I am impressed. The game play is excellent and the storyline is as engrossing as ever. I got hooked out of the gate and even my wife who is not a fan of video games found herself engrossed right along with me. The only real complaint that I have is the lengthy cut scenes that appear throughout the game and at times are a bit annoying. The ending set of cut scenes are far too long and the explanations and story are a touch repetitive at times. Overall this game is a must have for any fan of MSG the throw backs are nostalgic and the revisiting of characters is fun and exciting. Excellent game!!"
1,Hate it!,"I can't believe I spent good money on this vacuum. I've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems: why it won't vacuum without pushing it with all my might, why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children, why the filter won't stay in place, and why it SMELLS LIKE BURNED RUBBER every time am forced to use it. I have replaced every filter and belt. Now I am going to throw it away. I'd gladly give it to charity, but I can't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim!"
1,the worst I've ever owned,"I bought this vaccuum 2 years ago based on the online reviews. I am sooo sorry that I did! After one year it quit standing up on it's own, soon after that it literally started coming apart - there is a gap down the side of the machine. Now it smells like a burning belt every time I use it, even though I just replaced the belt. The canister needs to be emptied about every 2 times I use it (at least it picks up dirt), but it makes a HUGE mess to knock the dirt off the filter. I have to go outside and I still get all full of dust. I contacted the manufacturer after about 6 months of ownership and they just said to call a repair shop. The repair shop wouldn't tell me what was covered under warranty, and they said I would need to leave it for 10 days or more so they can look at it. I am now going to go back to buying a Hoover with a bag. I'd rather change the bag than deal with these filters."
5,a great resource,This was just what we needed to help us with our Conversational Spanish class that we are enrolled in just for fun. We would highly recommend it.
3,dictionary,"I was o.k with the dictionary, however I did not get the CD that was supposed to be included with the order."
2,Didn't fit very well,"I am 5'-7"" and this product did not fit me very well. I had no illusion it would fit like the woman pictured, but I hadn't imagined it would bunch up. The garter straps are not adjustable, which makes it difficult to get a good fit. If you are a short woman, I would purchase with caution."
4,Great View!,We enjoyed this DVD greatly. The acting was superb. We wished that it had shown events later in Dorothy's life.
3,Hoping for better roads,My husband and I were disappointed in this book due to some of the roads aren't in very good shape and others were dirt. Not that great for a motorcycle.
3,into the classic sound groove!,"i love both songs and they are both rare and this single is truly a collectible dance hit from madonna. i have nothing against the songs in this cd. what i'm after is the quality of the sound recorded. it never sounded a cd to me. it seems that i'm playing my recorded tapes as it sounded like one. i hope warner remasters this and make it sound like a cd. a vinyl will even sound better. but for any madonna fan, its still a must have. go buy just the same like i did."
4,It would get 5 stars if it was smaller,"great, leaves my skin smooth soft, doesn't scar the way shaving does, but it would be nice if i could use it on the underarms or bikini area. but its too big for that."
5,Willima Lee Golden,"This is a super album of Golden as a soloist. Contrary to what this page says, he was still a group member when the album was made. The Oak Ridge Boys even joined Golden on two songs. For those who may not know, Golden rejoined The Oaks in 1996, and has made another solo album called ""My Life's Work,"" which is available at oakridgeboys.com"
2,Misses the Mark,"I'm sure Mr. Watts is a very smart fellow, but I find this commentary (and Watts' 2nd volume) mostly unhelpful. Watts holds to a rare theory that Isaiah is a play written in its entirety by a 6th century BCE (i.e. post-exilic) anonymous writer. This is a very unconventional theory and I'm not aware of any other major commentator who shares it. It's neither the traditional Isaiah nor the Deutero-Isaiah theory.I gave it two stars instead of one because maybe Watts gets some credit for creative scholarship - which at least gets people thinking. But as a useful commentary for most people, I'd avoid it. I am disappointed that Word chose this as their Isaiah commentary. I generally like the Word Commentary series, but this one totally misses the target. My advice to Word - dump it and commission another Isaiah volume by a different writer."
3,buy ear plugs!,"This is really a great machine; a must have if you have young children or pets. It's very powerful and gets the job done. I have ceramic tile, wood, and oriental rugs; it's perfect for cleaning all those surfaces. Also great for quick pickups on wall to wall. It's light weight, easy to use, and stands up on its own, unlike some other stick vacs I looked at. I would give it 5 stars, but the noise is so deafening, I cannot recommend this product without a warning."
1,Totally Worthless,"I bought this vac to replace an older Dirt Devil stick vac that I had for about ten years. I really liked the old one and thought I was getting a more powerful version of the it. The new one is more powerful alright, but all the power is situated in one tiny section of the floor brush. If you don't aim that section right onto what you are trying to pick up - forget it!I agree with some of the other reviewers on the noise level. It's so noisy I feel I should be wearing ear plugs. Also, I can't figure out what's with all the air that blows around while you're trying to focus on your one little area. I think that's where all the power goes. Dust, debris and hair blow all over the room.I'm going this weekend to buy a new stick vacuum that works. Maybe I can sell this one in a garage sale.My advice to others is DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I only rated it with one star because I had no other option."
4,Torquey,"I concur with all of the reviews ranging from 1-5 stars on this vacuum. It is loud and the exhaust does blow very strong. These ""cons"" are attributed to the high power that this unit has. It picks up dirt and long hair very well. And since the vacuum head doesn't have a conventional brushroll, it cannot jam with hair. This vacuum is used in an apartment with approximatly 800 sq.ft. with 50/50 carpet and tile floor. It loses one star for the noise...although loud, it is bearable."
2,I'm giving mine away,I liked this vacuum at first but I think it was only because I had a Bissell broom vac that was terrible. It really doesn't have enough suction. Spend a little more money and get something with more power.
1,The Worst Product,I have never hated a product more than this one. It is so loud that it hurts your ears. The dirt is just blown around and you spend all of your time revacuuming spots.I am getting rid of it. Don't waste your money!!!
2,There's a tornado in my apartment!,"Plug your ears! What all the other reviews say is true, it is really loud. My major complaint is the filter. Emptying out the cup isn't bad, but when you have to tap the filter on the side of the trash can to loosen up all the fine particles, they fly right up into my face and make a huge mess. Plus the blower on the unit blows the dust around my room before I can vacuum it up. Often I'll see dust/pet hair on the sink, etc. after I use it. Gross!"
1,Powerful Motor with nowhere to go,I've had my Dirt Devil Power Stick for two months now. The motor has enough power to suck like crazy but the vacuum's design leaves this an impotent appliance. With the handle positioned high the suction is diminished due to poor design inside the vacuum head's knuckle. I'm tall so this is a problem. The front of the vacuum head is really designed to suck best in the very middle making it hard to reach close to walls or corners. Consequently it does not cover much area. And larger particles stay in the head. When you turn the vacuum off they will be redeposited back onto the floor. My Dirt Devil will make it's last trip today.....to the dumpster.
2,"OK, but Awkward","The reviewers that mention the noise are dead-on, this is the loudest vacuum I have used. The noise is not the reason for the low review, it is simply awkward to use. I was looking to replace an old electric broom for use on hard surfaces and stairs and the power stick is not a good choice. It picks up fairly well when the dirt is in its path but blows a lot around and is difficult to get into small spaces or against walls. I did not see any options in this class of vacuum with edge-cleaning but the lack of a swivel feature makes cleaning with this model harder than I expected. I have replaced this with a Hoover ""Flair"" and found it serves my purposes much better than the Power Stick."
2,One of the most poorly designed products I have ever bought,"I bought this to quickly pick up dog hair in between my thorough cleanings. I have a big golden retriever who sheds huge amounts of fur. I have Spanish tile and the ""dust bunnies"" were rampant. All this product did was blow them around faster than it sucked them up! The exhaust from it blew the fur into the air and redeposited it everywhere other than where I was vacuuming! I had to run the air cleaner all day after using this. It made a mess. I also agree with those who said it was too loud. I had to wear ear plugs to use it. It is dangerously loud."
1,"very cheaply made product,works great if they dont fall apart","Hella 2020 Optilux 55-Watt Driving Lighti bought a set of these for my other car 5 years ago,they worked great,great performance and durabilty.then i bough a set for my other car in december.when i installed them,before i even got to turn them on for the first time,one of the glass lenses fell off when i was wiping my fingerprints off with a rag.amazon was very good at issuing a replacement set.when i installed these,the first time it rained and i turn them on,one of the lenses cracked,so i have just said heck with it and gave up.they must be made different now,because my original set from 5 years ago is still working fine.i would not recommend buying these."
4,A true classic,"This is a classic hero saves the day story, except it was written long before Hollywood was ever in existence. It was a good, short, and action packed novel sure to please anyone who reads it. No, this isn't Pirates of the Caribbean, these pirates are the real deal and they don't give anyone a chance. Arrghh, a real treasure of a book matey!"
5,Superman before Superman,"I'm a fan of Superman, while some of the episodes in each season can be a little wonky or cheesy overall, its one of my favorites!"
5,Super Season 3,"I think I am addicted to Smallville. I bought the first 5 seasons on DVD at one time and I was hooked at the first episode of season 1. Season 3 continues the saga of the coming of age Clark Kent aka Superman. It has some really good off the wall story lines as well as the continuing developing story line and relationships between the main characters - Clark, Chloe, Lana, Lex and Pete. All the seasons are good on their own but to get the full effect of Smallville you need to watch it from the beginning."
4,Good Service,I was very impressed and thrilled with my service from the seller. Product was quick in delivery and came in great shape. Will definately order again.
2,Not impressed,Everything arrived on time and the discs work fine but I ordered a new product that was described as factory sealed and was far from it. It was not sealed and it was not packaged like the other smallville seasons. The case was falling apart and the binding is broken. Don't label as new if its not.
2,"Not as good as ""Captive Passions""","I bought this book eagerly, since I loved the first one and its kick-behind heroine Sirena. Sirena's fiery invincibility is absent here - she mourns excessively and irrationally for her dead son and caves to her abusive second husband. Regan van der Rhys is an insensitive jerk and philanderer and so is his son Caleb, who has developed into a major disappointment as a major character in this book. I wanted to see Regan and Sirena's fiery passion, not see them sleep around with other people. Read ""Captive Passions"" again and don't waste your time with this one."
2,Disappointed Johnny Winter fan...,"I'm not really a ""completist"", needing to have every recorded bit of my favorite music people, but I do tend to go a bit overboard at times. So, I've collected a bunch of Johnny Winter recordings over the last thirty plus years. I bought this CD on Amazon, and it turned out to be a colossal disappointment! The song selection is OK, but not outstanding, there are no credits, so I GUESS the tracks are outtakes from the early ""Johnny Winter And"" sessions. To my untrained ears, the performances just seem a little ""off"", or not fully mixed down - something just ain't right! I hope that Johnny is getting proper royalty payments from One Media Publishing (whoever they are), and if not Amazon should drop it from their listings."
2,Ripoff,$16 for a CDR ? I don't think so it should be under $10. I gave it 2 stars just because it's Johnny Winter.
1,Questionable Geology,Deep Time and the Texas Hight Planes has several factual errors. It is obvious that the author area is not geology. He should stick to history.
3,Here's how to program the Audio Presets,"If people would take the ""Tour"" provided in the software, they would find out how to program the Audio Preset buttons. In reality they are Website Presets. Simply go to a website, press and hold one of the Audio Preset buttons, until the Website name flashes on the screen in green. That's it, it's set.My opinion - I don't like the Mouse - I'm using my old MX700 mouse - I love it.The keyboard - Its the best. Period."
2,"Too small, and the software sucks","I've had this keyboard for about 9 months now, and the two things I do NOT like about this keyboard, is that its function keys are too small, and the software is pretty bad.In those nine months I've had to recharge my mouse about 4 or 5 times, and I've had to replace the batteries from the keyboard only once. By itself quite a feat. However, what truly bugs me is that for the SIX WEEKS before the battery actually went dead, an annoying little icon had been blinking in my taskbar, warning me that the battery is low. It's good to know that in 6 weeks I'll have to replace the battery, but I'd really prefer it if I could switch that icon off. If that wasn't enough, at irregular intervals (sometimes only ONE MINUTE apart) a blue little window (the size of a big stamp) moves into view, ALSO telling me my battery is low.If I'd known this in advance, I wouldn't have bought this keyboard/mouse set."
4,Nice Set,"Keyboard has a good feel to it. The mouse is a little heavy, due to the batteries, but it is very ergonomic."
4,Logitech LX700,"This item meets all my expectations for cordless keyboard and mouse. The mouse batteries are rechargable and is shipped with it's own handy recharger. The keyboard is smooth operating and can be positioned almost anywhere. If you are looking for a nice accessory with quality components, this item is for you."
2,Returned for refund...,I bought it because it had the rebate and thought it would be nice deal with a free shipping. I found the mouse on this combo is extremely uncomfortable. Basicaly every time I put my hand on it I begun thinking about the edge under the fingers.If you want it.. go in the store and try it first.
1,An Electric Sander with Low Grit Sandpaper,"You might as well buy a sander, put low grit sandpaper on it and put it on low speed. Ladies, save your money. If you have sensitive skin, I hope you don't break out like I did. I took mine back for a refund"
2,Agree with Gonefission,"I completely agree with the ""Please don't waste your money!, November 9, 2003"" review from: gonefission from Peoria, IL United States.The description of the product is word for word of what I've felt and have experienced except I do not have dark, thick hair."
1,A great way to make your head look like Gorbachev's,"I bought this product hoping I could use it on my head....which in and of itself may seem stupid to y'all.....but, it said it painlessly removed hair of any length. The person who said it was an orbital sander had it right, and it mostly sanded the skin, not the hair. I ended up looking like Gorbachev with mange.....big red blotches, chunks of hair, had to use a razor to get it back into shape, used aloe to calm the burning which made it worse.....So I returned it, I would by only if you want to open a low level torture botique..."
1,Don't waste your money,"It did remove hair on most of the surfaces, but I could not make it work in concave areas. It made my skin really irritated. Irritation was so severe, that I had to go to the doctor and use medicated cream for two weeks.Hair started to grow back next day."
1,I hated it,It just didn't work.I am sorry I order this product and my time wasted and money on returning the item
4,Good for the money,"I suspect that there are better fabric scissors out there, since these struggle a bit when you go through considerable thickness -- but for the money, I'd get them again. They go through regular thickness like a knife through butter."
5,"Great, Durable Phone","I dropped this phone on the very first day. I was sure it was not going to work or that I had broken the display.Neither was the case and the phone has worked flawlessly for two years now. Aside from the scratch across the display, which only sometimes affects viewing, this phone is perfect.I had one of the first blackberry ""pagers"" and was immediately comfortable creating emails and text messages with this phone. I'll buy another BlackBerry Pearl at the point when that becomes necessary. I appreciate the slim size and light weight and prefer that to more feature rich ""bricks"" any day!"
2,Nice design but seriously flawed,I first purchased the blackberry pearl through T-mobile in June of this year. A month later the speaker went out. I could only make or receive calls if I used the speakerphone...I managed to get a warranty replacement.I month later my employer gave my a blackberry pearl for official use; two weeks later it crashed (wouldnt turn on.) I had to wait for 30 days before I got the warranty replacement.Today my work blackberry pearl failed again; the speaker has gone out again..sigh...I have to say this is some real poor craftmanship.I wonder if this is a problem specific to the pearl....anyways just thought id provide another data point for people considering buying it.Guess I have to wait another 2 weeks before I get my replacement; thats 3 blackberry pearl's in less than 6 months..arrggg
5,Pearl is the bomb!,"I've had my Pearl for over 4 weeks now. It was tricky to active on a Blackberry Enterprise Server, but now it works great! Love the size and good looks. This is my first BlackBerry and it's been really nice to have and the web browser is really fast. It's a little difficult (small) to read, but if you need something on the web, you got it! Also, the voice activated dialing works really well, especially with my motorola headset. This is TRULY handsfree! Highly recommend the Pearl!"
2,Pearl - Great. Cingular - Not so Great,"I've had this phone and service(Cingular) 10 days now and am just about fed up. The phone is simply awesome, integrated email in the phone, the size, the user friendly menus, trackball is great, and the method to charge/data transfer is ideal(typical USB cable found with other USB devices, like Canon digital camera).What I'm done with is Cingular. I currently am a Sprint customer, not the best, but not bad either. I just wanted to try a blackberry, and I'm hooked. But I can't with Cingular. From the static on almost every call, to the numerous ""Call Failed"" when trying to make a call to the dropped calls(feweest dropped calls???). I live in the Washington DC area btw, if this matters.Guess my only options are Tmobile or wait until another carrier gets the Pearl."
2,A real disappointment...,"I purchased my Toshiba at a big box store and was attracted by numerous features. I have been using this laptop for about 15 months, and during that time the screen has gone bad and I am having issues with the CMOS battery not able to keep the proper time and date in the system.Due to the cost of replacing the screen, I found it more cost effective to purchase a flat scrren and use an external keyboard.Without a doubt, this has been the worse piece of hardware I have purchased over the past 20+ years."
4,Simple and FREE,"This book synthesizes the best and most simple ways to support your child's development (emotionally, cognitively, socially, and physically) at home.No more, more less.[...]"
2,OK but not what I was looking for,"This book is not for the intermediate or serious armature painter, but is more for an art major. I have picked up other books and DVD;s that are enjoyable. I.e., Bob Ross ""Grandeur of Summer"" and it was great."
4,Great quality,"I bought these for my daughter for her art projects, nice soft handles, size makes them easy to work with."
1,Poor customer service,"First, I loved the product itself. It was very easy to install and looks great. But BEWARE!!!! I have a small closet and had extra shelves so I wanted to purchase additional 47.5"" uprights to complete the look. RUBBERMAID DOES NOT SELL 47.5"" UPRIGHTS SEPERATELY. I had several emails back and forth with a Customer Service person who told me that they only sell them in the kits. Since they sell the 25"" uprights separately, I found this to be completely ridiculous. So, if you want to expand your Configurations closet, you will need to purchase multiple kits or a TON of the 25"" uprights to achieve the same end. While I liked the kit I still feel that RUBBERMAID SUCKS!!!"
4,Nice flexible system,"This is a very flexible system for maximizing your closet space. Take your time assembling it and it will be quite sturdy. I do have a few issues with it. First, the drywall anchors don't work very well; I never could get them to open up properly with the supplied tool. Second, the vertical supports are supposed to be placed 22 inches apart, making it impossible to anchor all of them into studs which have a 16-18 inch separation. Fortunately, they supply enough brackets and shelves so you can put the vertical supports at almost any interval and it will still set up fine. Lastly, if you install it at the height they specify, you will have a lot of trouble reaching the top shelf if you have 2 tiers of hangers. With the second unit I installed, I dropped the height by 7 inches and it is much more convenient that way."
2,"Not bad, but far from great soundtrack","This soundtrack is a good, but far from great score for the very good, but not great film GMK. Like the movie, the soundtrack has a new and unique feel, but too often seems a mishmash of themes, none of which inspire awe or seems cohesive. Too much of a cold techno feel does not help either. Little stays in the memory after the film is over, though the score at least does not offend or clash within the movie. It is never the less nice to have something other than Ifukube once more recycling old music cues from other films, but it lacks the quality of the soundtrack to GODZILLA vs MEGAGUIRUS. And sad to say, none of the composers that have worked on any kaiju film are in the same league as a Miklos Rosza, John Williams or Bernard Herrmann."
2,lack of vision,"Up through Rush's first live album and fifth overall, 1977's All the World's a Stage, the book presents itself from the objective point of view. After that it might as well be My Life as a Rush Fan. It is written at an elementary school level, nevertheless an easy read that could be finished in one sitting in this sound-bite society. The author awkwardly juxtaposes the song lyrics into his writing, and his prose seems especially lame when compared to quotes by the autodidactic Neil Peart. I can't complain too much because I ordered it after a man was handing out fliers at my first Rush show. It has some cool pictures but is for the die-hard Rush fan."
1,Bad Tom Clancy,"Apparently Mr. Blum didn't have a chance to read the manuscript upon which someone put his name. There is no such thing as a 'approximately 96.4 degree inclination,' and if there were, you couldn't get to it from Florida. The TitanIII launch vehicle would fall on Memphis, Chicago or Minneapolis. An eight inch resolution at ninety miles has little to do with the resolution of an orbiting sensor. Even at eight inches, how could the CIA whiz-kid distinguish beards or faces at an eight inch resolution, especially from directly above? If this purportedly true story could be so bizarrely wrong about easily checked facts, how can anyone believe those facts which, conveniently, cannot be verified? Put it with the Late Great Planet Earth and all the Noah's Ark Found books and move on to some good fiction."
4,"Good story, believable, but poorly documented","I read about this story in an archeaological magazine over two years ago and have been tryng to find the book ever since. I can vouch for some of the information presented concerning military works. However, to be a credible book, more evidence needs to be presented. Where are the sattelite photographs that we are told were evaluated by an expert revealing the thousands year old trail of the Israelites? Where are the references for the conclusions for Pollard's spying? I personally believe the thesis, but could not use this book as proof. It is an excellent read and makes me want to know more. I will be waiting for the opening of the new museum mentioned in the book."
2,Too Loud & Clumsy,The vacuum is too loud compare to my old Dirt Devil that I bought 10 years ago. The suction is not as strong as I thought. Do not like it as much as my old DDevil. Not impress.
1,I still see dirt...,"My old vaccum died on the first trip across the carpet after I moved into my first house. I bought this one from a local store in a rash shopping spree because I needed one. Upon use of it, I've found that it does not pick up everything on the floor, even after 3 or 4 swipes across it. The reason I want something to suck the dirt off the carpet is to keep me from leaning over to pick up a tiny clump of plaster or a fleck of a stone. This is one of the poorer vaccums I've used."
5,Garden Digger,"This is a massive tool. Well made. Will last forever, or at least your life time and maybe another generation. I use it all the time. I have others to choose from but I like the feel and wight of this tool. It's a must if you like digging in the garden or any other kind of dirt work."
1,DO NOT BUY,This book is way out of date and contains misinformation. It is worse than useless.I bought it here a few months ago and regret it.
3,"80s cheese movie, but still good","This is a great movie. However, I remember it being much better when I was 13 years old. If you get past the 80s acting, the plot and bike tricks are actually cool!"
3,Good acting but a weak story,I keep saying it but movies first and foremost are about the story. So you can have a great cast with a lousy story and you'll subsequently have a pretty lousy movie. There just wasn't much depth to any of the characters. They were all too typical. Of note is Bacon's performance which despite the characters blandness he manages to breathe some life into it. And as always Laurence Fishburne does a credible job.If you've got nothin' to do on a lazy afternoon this one could fill the time but if there's Anything you'd rather be doing don't waste your time on this one.
2,New York stock trader to messenger?,"I don't think so. Contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script. Think about it: take a dump on a stock and get wiped out; now you are a messenger? I do not think so. I know of a few New York Stock Exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades, but this is crazy. Thank goodness they kept the New York scenes to a minimum. Yes, he was suppose to be at the NYSE and not the Pacific Stock Exchange as a previous reviewer wrote."
4,"Fine entertainment for cycling fans, less so for others","I don't know where the editorial reviewer got the idea that there's an ""uprising ... against the evil bosses"" at the end of this movie. There's no such thing, the climax of the movie is a showdown on the street with a vicious drug dealer. Perhaps the reviewer didn't actually watch the movie...There's lots of great footage of urban cycling, even if some of it is a tad unrealistic. It's a fast-paced movie with lots of cycling action and actually has a multiple interesting plot lines, not related to cycling."
3,A hilarious and ridiculous movie,"This movie is unintentionally humorous, mainly from how absurd it is. Lots of good bike tricks, however. The plot is a bit hard to swallow. Kevin Bacon delivers a truly Bacon-y performance."
2,Try a different one.,I've used many aloe products over the year since I've got dry skin living in the desert. This one dries sticky and leaves a filmy sense on the skin. Try a different one.
1,Among Cultures,"Perhaps I shouldn't be entering a review, because I never received this book. I ordered it about a month and four days ago, and nothing. Hm, I should probably look into getting my money back. Word of advice: Don't order books from the UK unless you actually live there."
1,Lasted for 3 months,The connection into my car's headunit aux port became faulty after 3 months. It worked fine up to that point.
4,Money well spent,"Never having had a juicer, it's all I need... and it's a GREAT price!!! Works great!! Love the juice I made so far. Great deal, great price, highly recommend it for anyone!!!"
5,Great deal for casual juicers,"The product came packaged as if it was brand-new and there wasn't a scratch on it. If it hadn't been listed as reconditioned then I wouldn't have known it. I don't use mine every day so this is perfect for me and the right price but you do have to cut up larger fruit and vegtables because the opening isn't very big. So for someone who uses it everyday that would be an inconvience. It is easy to clean as long as you do it right away but I would recommend getting a bigger brush, the one that it comes with it is too small for cleaning the whole machine."
5,"If you find you are at all on the fence about this, you probably sell juicers...","This is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone.I am not in the habit of writing reviews, but this juicer earns it.Perhaps you are like me, and have never used a juicer before. You want to get one without taking out a small loan, because you just don't know if your that into it. If so, this is your juicer.There are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting. I just want to back those up with my experience. This is a good, strong product."
1,juicer,"product does not remove all the juice from the item you are juicing. I thought it would do a better job, glad I did not pay any more for this."
3,In need of a bit more juice!,The stainless steel outer shell makes this juicer look sophisticated and modern. Easily disassembles for easy cleanup. The cons are as follows- it is big and bulky and will need a permanent space on your countertop (if you use as much as we do). It also leaves a lot of leftover bi-product-the leftover I think could be shredded more to squeeze out a bit more juice. Easy solution-blade is detachable-perhaps Waring can make a revised version for those of us who need a little more juice!
3,Interesting collection,"Kafka is not for everyone, and so it seems, not for me either. This collection contains several stories by Kafka. Many of them are entertaining and thought provoking. But in the end most of them are simply strange and dehumanizing. They often leave you scratching your head and looking for a point. There are as many interpretations of Kafka as there are readers, probably because he was slightly crazy and perhaps didn't actually have a point. This is only for a certain class of reader."
1,A Commute in Overdrive,"This really is a pretty long, boring commute. The traffic doesn't move much, and the road takes the reader through a whole lot of over-complicated and over-decorated scenery. Not to overdo the metaphor (but why not? Marlys Millhiser certainly does) I felt as though I were stuck in traffic, looking out my car window while a group of strangers hurried past me. I didn't care about them, and they didn't stop long enough to include me in the events. Add to that a gimmicky prose style, a virtually unintelligible dialogue, and a synthetic and twisted plot--and you have this novel: a perfectly awful journey that couldn't end fast enough. Avoid the drive."
5,"Logic, language and notations have made all the difference.",Topics builds up in a logical order. The languageused through out is stimulating and easy tounderstand. Mathematical notations are straightforward.This book is a must have for both begginners and the seasoned professionals who do FiniteElement Analyis.Anthony A. R. Lukindo
3,Pop Music,"Ok I admit this may seem a little crazy but yes a college student did find the movie and music entertaining. The movie had a cute cast and a interesting plot, after watching it with my cousins I felt it was one of my top favorite disney movies. As far as music by far the best out of those movies for fun teen pop music. Good album for the kids."
5,awesome cd!,"This is one of my favorite cds that I have. Here are my ratings for each song.Perfectly:10/10 one of my favorite songs on the cd.Nothings Wrong with me:8/10 it's an ok song but person who sings it has the worst voice!Notice me:9.5/10 great song but a little slow.Get Real:9.5/10 I love this song,but it gets a little boring at the end.When the rain falls:9/10 good song but too slow to dance to.If you wanna rock:7/10 it's ok but it's just not my type of songDon't even try it:9/10 I love this song but it's one of those songs that get stuck in your head easily and won't come out.Tru Blu:4/10 this song is so stupid and annoying!"

1,Not if you want a serious pattern book,"As a serious knitter, I was quickly disappointed with this book. All of the printing is done in purple ink, which I found very irritating while reading. Far too much of the book was taken up by strange interpretations of classic stories involving women, mixed with large doses of unnecessary autobiography and new-age philosophy. Some might find the stories interesting or inspiring; I found myself flipping past them in annoyance to find the patterns... which were poorly illustrated with sketches in purple. I truly love knitting and am always happy when someone else shares that love, but this book was neither helpful nor useful to me."
3,Long Lost Favorite,"When Shute was writing, I read every title I could get my hands on. When I moved (twice) none of his titles were available, even at a County Library. I was so pleased to see his name in the Kindle store. This novel I had never seen before.I have several paperbacks of his and they are dog-eared because I have read them so often; they are such good stories and the character are real. I love an author whom I ""hear"" as I read. I expect to buy a bunch!"
2,"O.K., but not as good as the first one","What happeded to these guys? La Sexorcisto was good, straight forward, metal, coming out at a time when all this alterna-garbage was on the rise. On this one they went along the trendy industrial route. The few good songs are ""Supercharger Heaven"" and ""Electric Head, Pt.2""."
5,Can't go wrong with mid 90's rock,"This album rocks! If you think Rob Zombie's solo project is ok, White Zombie rocks so much more. Since Zombie is really into techno-ish beats, this album really make you want to jam out. It has a great pase, which makes it a great party album."
3,Only for hot dog lovers,"This thing works great cooking-wise, but can be a real space hog if you don't eat many franks. More of a gift for those who have everything."
1,Disappointed,"I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend to anyone that they purchase the Hot Diggity Dogger (unless major improvements are made). I was very disappointed with the appliance, once I tried it out. You can only use regular size hot dogs (no jumbo, bun length, etc.) in this machine and even then, the hot dog is unevenly cooked. Let's just call the bun toaster a bun warmer, since that's about all it does. The machine doesn't push the bun up against the heating plate, so only the edges of the buns touch and, therefore, get toasted."
2,ok,I read this book after just having read 'Forever' and I suppose after that stinker anything was good. I thought The Mulberry Tree was ok but very confusing. I had a hard time keeping track of the characters toward the end and kept having to flip back and refresh my memory. Also: how exactly did Jimmy come by the farmhouse in the First place? What was the feud between Patsy & Janice? (Never explained). Why didn't Jimmy just tell her the whole story for God's sake? And I still don't understand why he left the money to Ray & Atlanta. It just didn't make any sense to me.
2,Avid Alabama Reader,"This is not one of Ms Deveraux' better works. The story line was good and if the heroine had overcome obstacles herself instead of having all her difficulties eliminated for her, as if fairy godmother waved a wand, it would have been a better story. If Ms Deveraux' purpose was to lay a basis for future sequels, she did a good job of giving us thumbnail characterizations. The book left me wanting to know the stories of several of the other characters. My favorite Deveraux book is Knight in Shining Armor and that heroine was also showered with fortuitous circumstances. The difference between the two books is that in Knight, we have already suspended our beliefs and accepted the time travel so it isn't such a leap to accept additional beneficence. But the modern setting of Mulberry Tree requires us to leap back and forth between reality and fantasy too often. I look forward to reading more from Ms Deveraux but I suggest she decide in which venue she writes."
1,hated it !!,"I have read all of Jude Deveraux's books and thought that I would always love her books, but I hated this one. She made it sound like staying at home to take care of your husband and your children is a bad thing while going out to run for president while someone else takes care of your kids is a good thing.At the End of the book, the supposed heroine only wants her privat life undisturbed. My goodness what a choice....to be a billionare or not hmmmmmmmmm....to be able to rebuild a town and help people out or to turn down all that money. Lets get real here.... in the future I think I will think hard about getting another Jude Deveraux book if it turns out to be like this one and the last few..."
3,Useful for a Punk Look,"It's great to use after washing your hair, making it easy to style; I don't like the way my hair/head itches afterwards. Consequently, I only use it when I NEED to look special."
2,Doesn't measure up.,"While I absolutly loved The Mists of Avalon, and was rather amused by Forest House, it seems that this book was put out only as a filler. The story lines were rather weak, and highly predictable. It simply doesn't match the author's extraordinary talents"
2,Ack....,"Of the Avalon Trilogy, this was my least favorite. Long, boring, and with uncomfortable breaks betwen sections/chapters, it was very confusing. The only saving grace was that it linked the Forest House and Mists so that they could be better understood when allusions to historical events were made. Read it, but don't expect fireworks."
2,Another disappointment.,"I think it would be better if some authors did notreturn to the scene of previous successes. Wherethe Mists of Avalon was captivating, Lady of Avalon and The Forest House are boring andforgettable."
1,Dull,"This is a dull and unimaginative novel. I'm not sure what book the other reviewers read, but Wonderland Murder is a pure bore."
5,Predictable & Blah!,"I thought writer Braithwaite's debut novel was predictable and blah. A major disappointment to say the least! Hopefully his next book will be less amaturish. I like the mystery books I read to sparkle but The Wonderland Murders (yawn) well, you know what I mean."
5,Excellent Debut,"Braithwaite has broken onto the mystery scene in a dramatic fashion with The Wonderland Murders. I heard him speak at Bouchercon, Cluefest, and Left Coast Crime. I liked his book and I hope future Jesse Ascencio novels are just as good."
5,"Previous reviewers say ""lavish""; I say gorgeous.","This book considers the problem of longitude from a number of viewpoints. While Dava Sobel's book concentrated on the Harrison/Maskelyne controversy, this volume uses historical, mathematical and geographic viewpoints. What is impressive is the genius, dedication and tenacity of the Renaissance scientists. They may not have had GPS but they knew what they were doing."
1,Not yet; Sister Betty . . .,I was very disappointed when I received my copy of this book. I expected a full-length novel for one thing...instead I got a short story....not a collection of stories but one single story! Which by the way; was not all that well written. There was a bit of humor and a bit of truth.....but I expected more.this material probably works better onstage but as the written word;...
3,Notes From the Underground,"Notes From UndergroundI approached this book eagerly having read ÈCrime and PunishmentÈ oh so long ago - and I am crazy for Russian novels. This is not a novel, first of all. It is maybe Èanti-novelÈ. The character is not a sympathetic one. It is difficult even to describe this often dreary person in a brief review. It is a tale that leaves an impression, however and I personally think it is best for anyone who would like to explore the strange world of the character to stumble upon it on her own. I do, also, recommend reading this book. I read it this summer on my porch."
1,HOAX,"There is no evidence presented here. A blurry picture analyzed looks like a chimp. Sasquatch does not look like a chimp. They find a supposed huge nest, go in it see some activity and then leave saying lets leave whatever is in there alone!?!?! Are they serious? Everything about this dvd is crap and false. Please don't waste your time and find other documentaries which have credibility."
2,Technical superiority,"2 1/2Epic acoustic live set from ambitious, operatic prog powerhouse Gildenlow and company is an admirable retooling of prior compositions into something altogether different, but still suffers from arrangement over-eagerness (as usual with progressive music, excelling most in instrumental numbers). I will always gravitate, for better and often for worse, towards artists who take pride in their songwriting, but the majority of PoS leaves me cold from an emotionally contrived manner."
2,Snowscoop Disappointment,"Tried my new scoop out two days ago in 3-4"" of wet, lake effect in Northern Michigan. This was exactly what I bought this item for. I have a push scoop on two wheels but it is too shallow and leaves a line of snow on either edge. I thought this scoop would allow the snow upwards on the scoop itself and eliminate this problem. This did not happen. The snow went up about a foot and then built up on the driveway in front of same. This made it difficult to push and hard on my back. The website says it works well in just this situation, wet and deep. No way!Granted the snow was wet and so was also sticking to my snow shovels. The advertising on the website is extremely misleading however. I also told the guy in Texas (official website) that I wanted it for 3-4 inches of wet snow. He said no problem (in so many words).I have written an email to the website and have had no response.I put some silicone spray on last night and will see if this helps. Oh, it also needs two wheels."
2,The discription didn't tell everything,"I have not heard it yet because I received a mini disk, which I can't play. The discription never mentioned that. This is very disappointing."
3,Cherish isn't one of my faves,"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."
4,Fills a niche perfectly,"It's a fun read. Each chapter can be read independently as the mood strikes. Some essays are outstanding, some are mediocre, but because it is so encapsulated, who cares? This is a good gift book because certainly different people will find something to respond to. I myself loved ""F"" for Fat, and ""M"" for McDonald's. Those two essays alone justified the book purchase for me."
1,Smells like joke,"As a Nirvana's fan i just can say : this CD sux. Probably if you like at least one of these bands, you'll find something good about it, but when i heard this CD it was like ""are you joking?"" The version for ""Smells like teen spirit"" made me cry, all the songs are so similar and they're all played like the worse punk you can hear. A tribute? i don't think so. Just a bad joke."
1,cheap!,this could be a great album but these bands have completly spoilt these excellent nirvana songs. don't buy this for your own good. A pathetic attempt at fantastic songs.
2,A sad unproductive mess,"Sure, a punk tribute to Nirvana is a great idea(in theory). First off, the sound quality is terrible throughout. Almost every song shares a sparse, uninspired sound and wholly non-passionate vocal delivery. None of these groups have added anything new to the songs. Not a single one of them should be covering Nirvana, at all. Fact: Most of these bands sucked to begin with... Cleopatra must have handed them a list of Nirvana songs and pointed to a crusty dump to record them in. This is a joke and not a very good one.I don't see the point of making such a joke. All punk tribute/cover albums: Burn in hell(or the fireplace, or incinerator)."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could.,"Don't buy this .... The only 2 semi good songs on it are the ones by the UK Subs and Agent Orange, and that's if you compare it to any of the other ones. Don't waste your money, and get something worth wile. By the way, I'm a huge Nirvana fan, but I also like the UK Subs and I'm extreamly upset at the cover they did. I am so ashamed for being a fan of theres (UK Subs) at the moment. sad, sad, sad world."
5,vivid poems tap into ancient roots,"Dubie's poems are infused with a paganistic energy--vivid, simple, preternaturally alert, free from any psychologistic traces. The volume's cover has a mask from a Roman fresco associated with initiation into the cult of Dionysus staring out wide-eyed. ""Lizards with sails are screaming to her while the green spade/opens a whole nursery, a powdered vault of spotted dinosaur eggs/racked with loose hexes of eight,..."" (from ""The Young Professor of Wyoming Wears a Red-Banded Skin of Snake on the Spirit Finger of Her Right Hand That Shakes..."") This could all be some kind of surrealism, except that it's more complex than surrealism. It doesn't just try to net the wayward detritus of dreams, but also to continuously evoke irrational but keenly felt fears, mysteries, and hopes."
2,great idea... horrible paint job,"So I don't write reviews very often, I have to feel strongly to do so. the mug is very cute, i love the size, handle and the lid. it doesn't stay warm for much longer than an uncovered one, but I find that it does help some. I can't comment on the tea infuser because i haven't used it.What has bothered me the most is that half of the ""berries"" aren't painted, and that is just poor craftsmanship and poor quality control. I would have expected more from this brand. i would ask for a refund but i didn't notice it until I had started using the mug.i have posted pictures under customer images."
2,Slightly disappointing.,"I purchased two of the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Covered Mug with Tea Diffuser, unfortunately on the first day of receiving the items the diffuser pin broke and the bottom rim of the mug chipped. So, I would not consider these items to be durable, but still a nice item to have for rare occasional use."
2,OK,"I am a movie buff and I'm always up for a good scare. This movie was ok but lacked a ""good"" scare moment if you know what I mean. If your just looking for an ok movie with a hint of scare than you'll like this movie. The acting was great don't get me wrong, but the script was missing something..."
3,Too Much Information,"This book gives a little too much information. Most Professors will require PreCalculus ESSENTIALS. So unless this one is required, get the condensed version of it."
3,call from god,I was upset whin I got my cd I payed for new one and got old one It coust more than it was wirth the saler sent a cd that was reseald and the case was broken. never agen well I get from these saler . james green
4,often overlooked song...,"""The Look Of Love"" is one of Madonna's most overlooked songs. Originally appearing on the horrible ""Who's That Girl"" soundtrack, and inexcuseably not included in the Madonna slow song anthology ""Somethig To Remember"", this is a song to pick up if you are a Madonna fan."
1,bad sound quality,"everytime i used this headset, the person on the line complained that she/he could not hear me well. the quality of this product sucks.i have not used it for a year, it totally died. after replacing the battery, it still would not work."
5,Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset,The Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset works well and looks good. Love the Battery option; no more waiting for the Bluetooth to charge.
1,Spend Your Money on Anything but This,"If you like throwing away money, send it to me instead of buying this thing. You'd getter better value from a bag of warm cow pies.The HS805 must have been designed and produced by a bunch about as bright as a bag of hammers.This product is bulky and balky. It drops calls, loses its connection, and will not repair with my BlackBerry 7100 without my entering the connection settings every time I turn it on.This is my second experience with a Motorola Bluetooth headset. Both products are of the same quality, though the design and engineering of the HS810 far outstripped the quality of its manufacture.If you're looking for a quality Bluetooth headset, ABM, (anyone but Motorola)."
3,San Diego's Finest Live Act Is Best Appreciated LIVE,"Jeff Berkley and Calman Hart are fine musicians, and the last thing I want you to think is that I dislike their music. I am a huge fan. Something To Fall Back On, however, leaves a bit to be desired. There are some excellent songs on this CD, but the whole thing lacks the energy of Berkley Hart live. If you are unfortunate enough to reside in an area where you can't see Berkley Hart in person, then you can get a better feel for their own brand of country-and-folk-inflected rock from their previous album, Wreck n' Sow. These guys have a sensational knack for sublime guitar and vocal arrangements. For a free shot at hearing these fellows, go to a website and download their amazing cut of ""My, My, My."" It's much better than the version on this album. You won't regret it. Then buy Wreck n' Sow, and go experience these guys in concert."
5,Fun with Mr. Munsch,I donated this book to my mom's day care and the children really loved repeating especially the chomps. The children also enjoyed the color changing. They always have fun with Munsch books.
3,A good debut,"I had fun reading this book. I think it would appeal to the young crowd. Where will the two main characters travel to next?One thing I did notice was that it was clear that a lot of work went into research for the book. This is something that I tend to appreciate. It seems the last part of the book, after B.B. meets Gaia has not been edited to the same degree that the earlier parts were."
1,Beware-Item not as described.,"This item is not strapless like it shows in the picture and like it says in the description. I received my item 15 days after I placed my order. I continually tried to contact the company and they did not respond. When I finally got through, I was told the item would be sent fed ex and that I would be emailed the tracking number. Neither happened. I would never do business with this company again, not if the item I needed would save my life. They are unprofessional, dishonest, and have terrible customer service skills. To top it off, when I finally received the item, it was not strapless like they said it would be. Paying 85.00 for a swimsuit is bad enough, but to get this kind of service for it is ridiculous. If you are pregnant and looking to buy a swimsuit, I beg you, go with another company."
1,ONE WORD: BAD,"The special effects were comical. The acting was bad. Richard Greico as a scientist reminded me of me of spastic Brad Dourif. The zombies ""live"" inside a walled area where the military drops a napalm type substance to kill them. When the zombies shoot down a helicopter with a makeshift catapult, a crack team is assembled to rescue them. The zombies prefer to eat eyes and they do try to breed with one female. The movie moves along slow. You can miss 10-20 minutes at a time and still keep up with the plot."
5,Really Cooooool...........,These are so cool. I love them. Their pretty spooky looking when your driving down the road passing my house.. I definitly recommend this product and others like it....
3,Review on Slip N Slide,It is a fun toy for my 4 yr old & his friends. They seem to enjoy it very much.
2,Too expensive for only one afternoon of fun,"First thing DH said when he opened it was ""too short."" No way were our 10 year-old boys going to be happy with the short length of the race track. So we bought a quality 20' tarp, didn't fill up the end barricade thing of the slip and slide, and extended the sliding length of the ""ride"" by three fold. The water on the tarp was the best part of the ride. It only lasted for about 3 hours and then the slip and slide tore down the center. We also had the wave runners which were not popular - sliding on knees was most popular. I guess maybe with some duct tape I can extend it's life to one more afternoon, but for[...] that is not a good enough value/durability for my money."
2,Wrong Item For Gift,I was sent the wrong product for a gift. The product sent made no sense for the kids receiving it.
4,More seasons for us who thirst,"Where's the rest of this story. Alex my be way over the top, but there are people out in the world just like him, so the charater is true and bless the individuals that deal with them in their enter circles. I'd like to see this show develop. Is anyone listening."
5,Noah's ARC delivers on many levels,"This series has been roundly praised for being grounding breaking and at the same time critized harshly for it's bad acting, poor production values, and un believable story lines. While all of the above is true the point is we love and can relate to these charcters on many levels and isn't that the point in the first place. Each week for two far to short seasons we fell in love with Noah, Wade, Chance, Ricky, et al. Watch these two seasons of DVD's and laugh, cry, root for, and fall in love with these characters all over again. Two of the Digisodes, one each on the season two DVD with Jensen Atwwod (Wade) and Darryl Stephens (Noah) while very heavy handed are nothing short of acting/writing brilliance. The chemistry is unmatched on par with some of the best television has ever produced. ENJOY because now all we have are the DVD's and the upcoming movie.Noah's Arc - The Complete Second Season"
1,Kindle description all wrong!,"The Kindle text is not verse, it is prose. It is not the Marie Borroff verse translation of 1967; rather it is a prose translation dated 1898, revised 1900!!!"
1,Don't spend the money!,"My son bought this with Christmas $$$ he recieved over the holidays. When we got it here we discovered that the software is clunky and that are many hoops to jump through. You must set your printer port to 0378, and a bunch of other nonsense. It was not as it had implied, plug and play. The software would begin a transfer and then stop. With no explaination. It just quit. We never did get the thing to work and ended up returning it. The one good thing I have to say, is that Amazon made it easy to return. When I asked online for this procedure, they gave me a printable screen to print the return lable with, and I sent the item back. Look somewhere else for your mp3 player. the raveMP was a big dissappointment."
2,Not So Good,I recently bought a rave mp3 player. Ive Had it for about a week now at it still wont work i called tecnical support but they were no help at all. The stupid program says illegal operation when i try to upload songs. Not sure why but i dont like this product at all.
1,Poor Customer Service,"Device works great..however, there is no updated software that is XP compatable. Customer service told me that they were 'sorry, but the 2100 is no longer a supported product'. They suggested that I purchase a newer model that was XP compatable. Will never buy anything from Sonic Blue again."
5,Just want I was looking for,"I had decided to host an Olympics party 2 weeks before the games began, with the theme, Everything Canada. These were going to be used to shape pancakes for an entree at the party.They're small, perfect sized for party type food. Unfortunately, we got 2&1/2 feet of snow after the item had shipped to me and I didn't end up getting them, due to poor road conditions and closures, until after the party. But that's fine. I'll use them again, probably not until fall though."
1,Not Worth It,The battery that was shipped to me was apparently used and will not hold a sufficient charge. It ended up being worse than the old battery that I already had in the phone. Find another vendor that will sell you a new battery. Don't waste your time and money here!!
3,Cheap yet not as expected. Fast shipping.,The product description led me to believe the battery was new. The battery came to me in a zip lock baggie with crud on it. I returned the item for a refund. Shipping is overpriced.
2,Battery less than expected,"The ""new"" battery holds a charge for much less time than I expected. I ordered one of these a year ago for a different phone and it literally performed like a brand new phone and battery. However this one barely increased the performance time over the battery I was replacing. Can't fault the price, and I was very impressed by the previous one I bought. Perhaps I just received a ""bad battery"" this time."
4,The Right battery at the right price.,The right battery at the right price. Easy to find a replacement battery for my older phone. If I ever need another battery I know where to look.
1,Very little how-to,"Like a typical (124 page) Amherst book, this one also showcases work by the A-list of wedding photographers. You get to see their high end wedding photos and some layouts. These pros talk about how much they charge for their work and what album services they use. While there are indeed inspiring layouts in this book, that's about the extent of it. Don't expect to learn very much about the how-tos of photo album design. There's no photoshop techniques presented or even a chapter about design applications and how to use them. If you like coffee table styled books with wonderful photos, that's what you will get with this book. If you're looking for specific how-tos, don't waste your money like I did."
5,Amazing book,This book is amazing it gives you so many different ideas and sources for wedding albums provided by other photographers. You are able to learn what they know and how they do their albums and it's just a great book. Lot's of information and I highly recommend it!

1,Dr. Duck,"This product is poorly manufactured. You have to pull it from a certain angle to make it work; otherwise, it gets stuck upon itself. Do Not Purchase!"
4,The ending let me down...,"I was very intrigued by the whole concept of the Nazi's occupying Britain in this second in a series of Timewyrm stories by Terrace Dicks. Dicks displays his knowledge of the Third Reich well and feeds it to the reader in a way that does not take away from the adventure in the story. The only problem I had with the story was the lame ending where we find out that it really isn't the Timewyrm that's been manipulating history directly, but rather the annoying War Lords from The War Games series. A fun read but a disappointing ending."
2,The Boys' Book of 20th Century Fascism,"What a terribly rubbish novel. It starts off reasonably promising - when the Doctor and Ace arrive in a Nazi-controlled Britain of 1951, it's a reasonably familiar Star-Trek-adventure-story what-if scenario. But as they go back to genuine, 1930s Nazi Germany, the grim reality shows the story for what it really is: trite, undermining pap. Terrance Dicks seems to take an almost perverse glee in the details, far too glib to respect what actually, horrifically occurred. It doesn't help that the Doctor's characterization, more stuffy Pertwee than scheming McCoy, is insufferably arrogant; you almost want Himmler to shoot the miserable sod. All this, with the Timewyrm arc poorly integrated into the plot, go a long way toward skuppering Dicks' authorial reputation. What was he thinking?"
3,Snoop and Sniff has lost its appeal,"WE bought this for our son remembering the old one from our childhood. Unfortunately it is all plastic! No wood at all to be found. The body and face details are all stickers which peel easily off. Where our son enjoys it, I would not pay the amount asked, it's just not worth it. Low quality."
4,Enjoyed this.,"This is an enjoyable DVD.I was attracted to it through a preview on a TV channel that sometimes airs episodes of Nature, which showed a spider and how her children devoured her as soon as they require their first meal, and she allows it.What i thought was a tarantula was an amaurobius spider, and it turns out its the way of things everytime!It covers motherhood of many different species and is brief but informative with each. I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 because it dragged just a little, but other than that and since I absolutely love nature, animals, and the visual aspect of the footage, I would recommend it. My 11, and 13 yr old'a attention was captured by it as well."
5,I have read and re-read this book a dozen times!,"OK, I admit it, I am enthralled with the genius of this boat designer, Phil Bolger. He has designed more boats than any person alive, 750+. This book reveals his thought process giving a window into his remarkably creative mind.I especially enjoy how he chooses to draw upon the vast tradition and the history of boats designed throughout history, and then updates and synthesizes these boat designs to reflect modern materials and his new ideas. Bolger reveals that in many cases; the modern school of boat design is a 'The King has No Clothes' proposition. Bolger repeatedly questions the conventional wisdom, much in a similar way to how Buckminster Fuller questioned 20th Century architectural and industrial design ideas.I simply can't wait for the next book by Phil Bolger! In the mean time I will re-read this one, and read his frequent articles in the magazine _Messing About In Boats_."
4,Good Collection,"I like this Collection of songs from her.not a Big fan of ""Open Your Heart""&I haven't been into Madonna fully in Years but some songs still are cool.""Gambler"" is a Cool song.""La Isla Bonita"" fits Madonna very well.no Lie Michael Jackson had a chance to Record ""La Isla Bonita' for His ""Thriller"" Album but turned it down.it fits Madonna rather well though to me.the extended version works to me."
2,I really wanted to love this!,"I bought this at a store, and thought it was such a great deal. And it was, until I lit the candles. The candles are made of such crappy wax, that they dissolved within the first hour or so of burning. I gave one to my coworker, and it melted down and burned a hole in his desk. If you purchase this, DO NOT LIGHT THE CANDLES! Let them be for looks only, and if you're happy enough with that, you'll be happy."
1,"Nice tool chest, But Poor shipping care","Well, i got this for my BF for his Birthday, but sadly,it was all destroyed, the Seller should, pay more for shipping, instead of having to replace or refund and loose money just to save a couple of bucks.He should make sure it gets with out damage to the buyer, Im very dissapointed, this seems to be a wonderful tool chest, but who wants a damage one? I will try to contact the seller and see if i can get another one, but he would need to pack it better, cuz i wont takee a damage one."
2,Damaged goods,This is a good product. However it was damaged(per a dent in the side of the cabinet) All packing was destroyed and am unable to send it back) I guess we just have to put up with said damaged item. sincerely dorothea boxler
5,Sturdy,Holds everything a good starter tool box for any mechanic. Arrived promptly and packaged with easy setup. Love this lots.
1,you get what you pay for,"This tool box is junk. Don't expect to push it around too much. I use this at work and have to move it around from machine to machine, and the wheels constantly get stuck. The drawers can't handle too much weight. One drawer I use for my screwdrivers and wrenches and the drawer is falling apart. If you want a good box, you've got to spend the money on it. If you do decide you want it, get wheels."
1,"Awful, terrible, no good, don't buy","First off, it came damaged. There were at least 4 dents. The metal used in construction is very flimsy and easily bends into the wrong positions which makes assembly impossible. Next, the instructions and packaging were created by an idiot. There is 1 page for instructions that is totally incomplete. ""Wrench"" apparently means screwdriver and you have to take it apart before putting it back together. Totally backwards, confusing, and frustrating. DO NOT BUY. I can't return because it was given as a gift without gift receipt."
1,great at first...,"I purchased this player because it was a good deal for a 256MB player with a radio. The player worked fantastic at first, the size of the player is definitely a plus. However, after the second time that I tried to change the songs on the player, the port that the computer cable plugs into broke. I was unable to change songs after this, when I exchanged the player the computer would not recognize the new player, despite reinstalling software, etc. I would recommend seeking out another player if you intend on using this player on a daily basis. (The headphones also broke after a week.)"
5,It's Great!,"I think that this game has very good graphics, great gameplay, and good control. It is not gory or bloody at all. So if you are looking to but it for your kids its okay. The way you get bombarded by enemys if you pass by a security camera or someone catches you is so cool. This is a must have for all gameboyers of all ages."
3,Charming But Meager,"Although this is very nice work I have given only three stars because it is so short. It includes just 17 poems, in 20 pages. There are also 12 pages of interesting prefatory material, and 15 pages of meaty notes, but even so this is more of a pamphlet than a book.That said, I really enjoyed this item. The translations have a breezy, witty, sexy, irreverent tone which seems to capture the poet's intention. The poems are rather freely translated, but the inclusion of literal translations in the notes lets you see where liberties have been taken. Most of the poems selected here are pederastic, somewhat reminiscent of the Greek poet Cavafy, writing more than a millenium later."
5,Cool stuff...,"These poems are really fascinating stuff. If this is what life was like 1,200 years ago, color me disappointed with modern Singapore!"
3,"Good, but not great","I am very grateful for the translator's attempt to get readers closer to Abu Nuwas' meaning, but ultimately I came away from the book feeling unsatisfied. The English rhyme scheme in most of the poems seems trite and force, and when compared to the prose translations in the notes has some serious inadequacies. I disliked that the notes also mentioned Arabic phrases that were difficult to understand, and not even included (or attempted!) in the notes. I would have preferred to have the prose translations alongside the poetic renderings.That being said, I applaud Mr. Tarab for his work- it's a great place to start for a western understanding of Abu Nuwas and his work. I enjoyed comparing prose and poetic renderings, and trying to imagine the world the original poet lived in. A good addition to my library, but certainly not authoritative."
5,A Must for Families or Professionals working with Aspergers,"This isn't a book, it is a ""good deed"" (no, make that GREAT deed). And even that isn't high enough praise. Page by page, we have found answers to dozens of questions that we have been asking, but previously finding no answers. We went to therapists, psychiatrists & psychologists, but until Barbara & Patricia came along with this book, our family was sinking fast.We are buying additional copies to give to family members and for the staff where our kid goes to school."
2,Madonna's Fever,"Before I purchase this CD, I would like to hear the single version. If it is like the version I heard on Saturday Night Live a few years ago (the show was a repeat), I'm interested in purchasing. Do you have a sample to listen to? I do want to buy this, but not if it is not what I heard. I really like what she did to Peggy Lee's song. Fever is one of my top five oldies but goodies and many singers have sung this song. I would like to introduce this version to my DJ, where I go dancing. Swing dancers would love this. Thanking you in advance."
2,And yet the best remix of this song is NOT ON IT,"Great, not fabulous. Something is missing. So I never bought this single. The best remix of Fever is actually the Video Version (also called ""Edit One""). You'll find it on the Rain/Fever import single (available here!)."
5,ghostly good canning supplies,Good set of canning utensils. My brother Dean said it was a waste of time but even he is enjoying all the grape jelly I canned during our down time.
1,Arrived completely shattered,Target employees do not know how to handle mailing glass items. I ordered 2 candle sets and both arrived smashed to bits. I would not recommend buying glass items from this website.
2,"Unclear, sometimes confusing","Concepts are not clearly defined, examples don't have good explanations. I would rather recommend Core Java 1.1: Fundamentals by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell."
2,"Lots of hype, but very poor game","Lara looks like a stick insect and there are so many moves and controls it's very confusing. Also, i didn't even know where to go and the enemies are stupid. Do not go out and buy this, either hire it first or don't bother at all."
3,Whoops it's out of date...,"Shipment went well but content is outdated. Gives basic information about assessment in all clinical areas however, I was hoping for more informal assessment tools (i.e., story telling, Damico's discourse analysis, etc)."
5,Invaluable Resource for Speech-Language Pathologists!,I am an SLP and work in a hospital setting and have found this to be an invaluable resource while working with clients of all ages. It takes what you've learned as a grad student and sums it all up into a useful resource that you'll use over and over again.
1,quirky program,"I think the Aperture program is a bit confusing. It uploads double images of any photos taken vertically with the new duplicate image turned horizontally and I can't figure out how to delete the duplicate photos without going through and deleting each photo individually. I was just looking through the other peoples reviews and am pretty sure many of the glowing reviews are being made by people that are selling the product and/or own stock in Apple, which is understandable. If you hit the help button on Aperture it uploads a pdf of the instruction booklet which again is vague. I also don't like that the program dredges up old photos from over a year ago that I thought I had deleted when it links itself with the iphoto library which takes a while for the computer to be able to update."
4,Aperture 2.1.1,"Great editing tool. A little confusing at first but worth it. One thing Apple needs to cure. When downloading, Aperture picks up all photos, images on your computer and puts them into Aperture"
5,great product,"For only an extra $6 over Curt's 10,000lb, A-6 Hitch Ball, the 30,000lb, A-41 hitch ball is a great deal. Well made, and the peace of mind is certainly worth the extra couple of dollars!"
1,Boring,"Too many feet of film left uncut. Too many details, establishing place, and what not. Get to the action. I was looking forward to seeing the film, esp with the 4.5 stars!I like Wyatt. I also like San Francisco and live in the neighborhood Wyatt's character lives in.But, this just wasn't that compelling."
3,A good product with a totally misleading name,"I wonder why Amazon would call this item ""MIU France Stainless Steel Juice Extractor, 3 Domesby MIU"" when in fact the box does not say anything of this item being made by MIU (does not even has a single french word on it) and it has a ""made in china"" sticker. The juicer does it job and seems to be made of stainless steel 18/10...But honestly you should change the misleading item description. At a first glance the four small pins, at the base of each dome, to keep the domes attached to the base when in use seem like a potential weak point. I really hope they last..."
1,NOT the ILLOGIC you're thinking of,This is NOT Blueprint's Weightless Crew affiliate AT ALL.I got so screwed from purchasing this for the full price and it's inability to be returned since it was opened and followed immediately by tears from a true hip hop head
5,Excellent. Great Buy.,"I had to install the bracket upside down (speaker is mounted on top of the TV instead of below) because the bracket hit the AV cables coming out the back of my TV (Panasonic Plasma 42""). It was no big deal. Still looks great. I would recommend the ""Omnimount"" product line to anyone looking for mounting brackets for flat panel TV's."
1,read only lock problem,"The card I received had a read-only lock switch that stuck out too far. Any time I inserted into my Palm Tungsten E or a separate SD reader it would push the switch to lock, preventing write access. The card does not resemble the photo. Mine was blue plastic with a yellow lock switch, not black on black as pictured. If they are farming out manufacturing then the quality control is slipping, since this should have been noticed."
3,Very Fast and reliable,"I bought this memory card to use it with my digital camera but then I bought a memory card reader and I've been using it to store music and videos, too.The memory has been very fast and reliable and I have never taken as many pictures to full 256Mb. But for the media, sometimes I found 256Mb to be insufficient. Sometimes I think a 512Mb card would have been better for my needs.There's a similar SD/MMC model which is packed with a portable reader (key chain) and you should take a look at it because it seems very tempting."
5,FANTASTIC,IT WAS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR MANY YEARS AGO. I LOVE THE SONGS HEAVENLY AND HEY GIRL. IT WAS GREAT I LOVED IT.
2,"Nice looking, but...","I bought three of these recipe card boxes, one for me and one for each of my daughters. I should have just bought just one and checked it out first. The box is a very poor design. Because of the design of the hinged lid, it is very hard to thumb through the recipes. The are down too deep in the box. You have to take the cards out to go through them."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"This activity book is great for trips, no matter what kind of transportation you use. My younger son (5) had a harder time getting all of it but it still kept him occupied. Everything you need is contained in the ziploc bag attached to the booklet. This is key since the dice, pens, etc. would get lost otherwise. My two boys love to play the license plate game on long car trips.I highly recommend this activity book. I've tried a few and many have been tossed away after 15 minutes but this one kept their attention. Anything that keeps my boys occupied during the boring part of getting to a vacation is a beautiful thing in my book."
4,hail the chief,A COLLECTION OF CLASSIC BLUES FROM THE SOULFUL BLACK KNIGHT TO TO ROCK ME BABY THE CHIEF ALWAYS DELIVERS THE GOODS. HEARTFELT SINGING TO BLISTERING GUITAR THIS IS YOUR CD
1,Mistake or Deception?,"I received the 24-Ounce water pitcher instead of the one I wanted which is the '34-Ounce' . I don’t want to pay for returning the wrong item because it will cost me more than the price of this item. In addition, I may likely receive the wrong one all over again. I don't know who is responsible for the mistake. I made one attempt to communicate the customer support. And I had a terrible time trying to understand what the representative was telling me. This purchasing experience is just to painful to be repeated."
2,"Ok, but not fast acting","DAP seems more about treating the owner rather than treating the dog. I tried this product and didn't see any effects. Nervous about Bonfire night and all the fireworks, I went to see my Vet and they suggested Calmex. I'd recommend it over DAP any day! It gets to work within 30 minutes!"
1,Didn't affect my dog...,"My dog, a 7 year old Chihuahua mix, suffers from separation anxiety. I purchased the DAP collar, spray, and diffuser even though in my opinion they were quite expensive. She has been under the influence of DAP for over two weeks now and I have seen no difference whatsoever. Therefore, I give this product a one star rating."
2,Didn't work for me,I think my dog is in the 20% of those it doesn't work for. For the money it was worth a try though.
1,No Luck!,Unfortunately this collar did not work for my dog who licks her paws/pads daily. I wonder if there is a money back guarantee??
3,Disappointed,"I keep hoping it will help, but doesn't seem to have any affect on our nearly three year old mixed breed dog. She still gets quite upset whenever any person or animal walks in front of our house."
1,didn't work,"This may work for some dogs, but we have a highly anxious dog that this did NOTHING for! For the money i am quite disappointed. However, i do know that these products can depend on the individual. much like anxiety treatment for humans. But, again, these are quite expensive."
2,Calming collar,Bought this collar for my barking dog but it didn't seem to calm her at all.Product had a very nice fragrance to it.
2,This Does Not Work,"I would advise people to buy a ""Thundershirt"" instead of this collar as it did not work for my puppy and he hardly has separation anxiety. I talked to my vet and my PetSmart puppy teacher about these collars and they wished I had spoken to them earlier as they would have advised against it as they know it hardly works for the dogs."
2,Not the best Robert Pete,"I love Robert Pete Williams' music and try to get as much of it as I can, but I'd have to say if I had listened to this one before buying it I would have left it on the shelf. Lots of slide guitar here, but he sounds unfocused in his playing and singing. Also there is an over amplified kazoo (!) being badly played over many of the songs. Go for any of the Arhoolie recordings (especially the magnificent 'Angola Prisoners'Blues) if you want a real dose of what RPW can do."
2,not so satisfied,"This towel looks very good, and it feels very nice too. But it does not absorb the water very well, as someone else mentioned before."
2,can't judge a book by it's cover!,"the towels are beautiful, big, and luxurious, however the problem is, it does not absorb water very well. looks can be deciving. i have to say that i was very dissapointed w/ the quality of the towels."
3,the vanished,"So there is this kid named Nick, and he wakes up to find out that every one has vanished. After exploring, he finds a group of kids, and together they try to figure out how every one disapeared. At first I thought the book was going to be stupid, because the begining was kin of lame. But as the book progressed it got alot better"
5,Most practical and fun nutrition book ever,"I read a lot about nutrition. Before I read this book, I smugly thought I knew my way around a grocery store. ""What to Eat"" confirmed many of the things I already know, but it also provided an amazing amount of new information. Marion Nestle's writing style is funny and down-to-earth. I couldn't stop reading. As I started each new chapter (cleverly organized like a trip through a supermarket), I found myself getting excited to learn about each new topic (""oh boy, milk!""). I love that Marion always shares her own opinions and how she personally shops for each item. I learned so much about nutrition and food marketing from this book. I am able to use this information every time I go to the grocery store. I feel so much more comfortable about my food choices and understand the marketing hype that I see all around me. Wonderful book!"
5,"Not a ""diet"" book ... It's BETTER!","The sheer volume of useful, commonsense information contained in this book is nothing short of amazing. I've changed my eating habits considerably just as a result of reading about the differences between conventional and natural/organic (like many others, I had assumed those two terms were interchangeable and was shocked to find out the difference) produce, dairy, meat and poultry. In fact I subsequently ordered extra copies to give as Christmas gifts to friends. This is easily my Top Pick Nonfiction Book for 2006!"
4,Great product. Lousy hardware.,"The included screws stripped trying to install into studs even with pilot holes and screw wax, and I didn't even believe that the cheap wall anchors could be trusted. So a supplemental trip to the hardware store was in order to get better screws and trustworthy drywall anchors, and that's the one-star deduction. Other than that, instructions were clear, install went smoothly, product holding up great after a month of use."
4,Rubbermaid shelves,Generally a good product that is easy to assemble and has a nice finish. One problem is the plastic end caps on the rods are too flimsy. Also depending on your configuration you will probably need more short vertical sections that are not supplied.
5,"Great product, great price!","This shelving unit is such a great value, I looked at both big box stores and they couldn't even come close on the price and I didn't even have to lug it home, it was delivered to my doorstep. How convenient! It has a ""stainless"" look to it that I like even better than the more expensive white version."
5,"As Good As Elfa, Much Better Price","I used this in a closet measuring 59"" Wide x 24"" Deep. Installation was easy, and the storage capacity of the closet has been quintupled. Best of all, I have enough shelves, brackets and rods left over to do another closet of the same dimensions - just have to purchase one horizontal Fastrack Rail for $15. Also, VERY speedy delivery, even though the vendor is not part of Amazons internal warehousing system."
3,POV not Perspective,"The term POV is often used interchangeably with perspective, and I was looking for a book to help me with writing from different character perspectives. This book doesn't cover that. So if you are really looking for a book on perspective, this is not the book for you.However, it does give excellent information on various points of view available to writers and how to use them."
5,This single gives me FEVER!!,"Tracks: 1-Rain (Remix edit)2-Fever (Edit One)3-Rain (Radio remix)4-Up Down SuiteThe version of Fever (track 2) on this single is the version that was used for the video. Way better than the boring album version (on the Erotica album), this video version - also called Edit One - is very hard to find. It's not even on the Fever single!About the other tracks on this single: Rain is ok, though I think the album version is better, and Up Down Suite is danceable but totally pointless if you ask me and way too long (12:14).Grab it as fast as you can for the track 2, but for the track 1-3-4, well, there's no rush."
2,Just silly,"I feel that this is really just an elongated sticker that could never serve any luggage use. For a gag gift, it still retains its full charm. I just thought the sticky substance would latch on better to the luggage and allow other travelers to also enjoy my goofy sense of humor."
4,The worst singer on earth,"This band's tight, solid, well rehearsed, technically good, and write great songs. Some of the best and most interesting arrangements of horns that you'll find. The instrumental work on this album is what makes it great. The singer's horrible. It seems the Achile's Heel of ska for the last decade or so has been singers. Lots of great ska bands with crap singers. I'd say more than half of the Moon Ska world falls into this catagory with Dr RingDing and the Senior Allstars as the best example.Skavoovie, fire that guy, get someone better.Even though No Doubt isn't, of course strickly speaking, ska people like them because Stafani's one hell of a great singer, and the band is mediocre to say the least. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones is another example of a mediocre band with a great singer...So in the bazzilion to one chance that someone in that band reads this review, please give that guy the boot."
3,"""Without Risk"" Indeed...","Apparently, this book takes the complex and treacherous field of ctonic magick, and makes it safe and easy to use... ""Azathoth for windows"" I suppose... Pray it doesn't crash.A better Idea might be knowing what you're doing...""But what if I'm not smart enough to do it?"" they asked...""Same advice I'd give if you weren't smart enough to operate a vehicle, or use a firearm... Give me that damn thing NOW, and stay the hell away from it!!!"" He said."
4,Is it real? Does it matter?,"Whether or not the Necronomicon is real is rather trivial. If it IS a hoax, it is still a fun read. I have not tried any of the spells because getting up at 3 AM is rather inconvenient for me, but I'm sure they are a lot of fun. If it IS real (and I've met a number of people who will swear on their lives that it is), then it is worth its weight in gold. Either way, you can't go wrong."
3,Simple use and sactisfatory results,"This rituals are quite simple and the result is satisfactory. Personaly I have used a more direct technic to work with this forces. If the practicioner have the experience to do an evocation to one of the 50 names of Marduk, then perform it. Then, it will be a lot simpler to work with the forces mencioned there. Just one last comment, do not use the direct practices of the Necronomicon (the main Sumerian book from wich this one has been extracted) to summon this forces if you are not very well prepared to. Danger is real. To replly to this review, please e-mail me to varcan@hotmail.com"
3,Disappointing Collection,"I waited a long time for this greatest hits package from Faith Hill and I was so disillusioned when I put on the CD and realized that the sequence of the CD tracks differs from the one on the jacket. This is an unforgivable flaw considering the constant push backs and long time it took for this compilation to be released. It would've been nice to get the pop versions of the songs since most of us Faith Hill fans probably own all her CD's which contain the original versions of the songs, it would've given the fans a chance to own these hard to find versions (or a 2 CD set with one disc with original versions and a second disc with these pop mixes, like Amy Grant did with her greatest hits package a few years ago).The DVD is pretty good, but is missing some videoclips, probably due to licensing issues which is understandable.I would be so happy to see a new and improved version of this compilation coming out with the corrected flaws, Faith deserves better."
2,Ignores Early Hits entirely,"If you listened to this, you might get the impression she didn't release any albums before ""Faith."" All her early hits from ""It Matters to Me"" and ""Take me as I Am"" were ignored altogether. I think these are her best two CDS so was disappointed."
1,good idea wrong decade,flav was supposed to make a solo album around 90-91 when pe was at the top of their game but don't know if drug issues or griff's anti semitic remarks or unknown foerces was against it anyway flav now a reality tv star decides to milk his newfound fame to the dust and yes it's a funny cd it would be better if it came out in the early nineties it might have went gold.
2,"Lots of pages, but no meat for a systems administrator","I originally bought this book as a sytems administrator's reference. I was disappointed by the lack of depth provided on most topics, and the poor job done indexing.For example, I ran into an issue where I needed some refresher information on the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. I found a single page of basic descriptive information on p134 compared to the in depth information provided by an out-of-date Sam's Fedora Unleashed (Ball and Duff).I only recommend this book as an orientation to those newly learning Linux/RedHat/Fedora. The book does do a good job of providing links and references of where to obtain further information on many topics."
3,OK,overall ok. There are better children's cds. Some of the songs are really twisted and a little dark for kids. And I am usually the last to say so.
3,Collectors Item,There's nothing special about this cd-single except for the cover. But it is most certainly a special item.
3,Boring and cd errors,"the way this book was written is terrible and cant keep my attention for more than 10 seconds, the CD has many many errors on it."
2,Less than interesting,"I expected to find Sinclair recounting his experiences, his work, his efforts. Instead, a confusing mass of minutiae about people long past, places of little interest, events of little significance and an almost constant self-effacement. Not worth buying, in my mind."
1,diapponted buyer,I bought this for my son. He was very disappointed after receiving this item. It was not a regular Pokemon cards that he had. He did not understand there were different manufaturers for the cards. Topps was not one.I wish there were sample card that he would of seen instead of just a picture of the box. He would of never chosen it if he saw the actual sample card at the site.
3,"Mediocre Remix, Not Worth it",I bought this cd for the remix of Papa Don't Preach. The remix wasn't that great. It seemed unprofessional.
3,"Great Song, not so remix","Reviewing this cd-single export for the extras only is not really worth the price if you are not a Madonna collector.1. Papa don't preach (Extended Version).- Just about a minute longer than the original version, it seems that only added some nre noise and extended the rythm, nothing new.2.- Ain't no big deal.- Dance song, for collectors only.3.- Papa don't preach (LP Version).- The same version that in the album, so nothing new."
2,Goes out of flat,"I bought this stone mainly because I was ignorant, and I did not want to bother with attaching sandpaper to glass or another truly flat surface. I used it the first couple of times and it was fine. After only a couple of uses, it has gone out of flat. On top of that, it's far too small to flatten the norton stones which are 3"" wide.I would not recommend this to anyone, just buy some wet/dry sandpaper and attach it to a known flat surface and flatten your stone that way"
4,"Disjointed narrator, disjointed story","This scattershot plotted book is charming, funny, haunting, but is it a novel? You will adore the characters. Jem examines her family through the filters of medeival history and her somewhat skewed understanding of physics, with charming conclusions drawn. Her compilation of ""evidence"" as to just who and what her mother is (possibly a Druid, possibly a good witch) is especially entertaining. The wordplay between her and her brothers, ""Rule 28,"" and her poetic descriptions of Harriet, her fey sister, make you want to move in with this family. But the book is circuitous and anecdotal, and the glimpses of the modern Jem leave the reader troubled, but with no answers. I was left feeling like a distraught neighbor, wringing my hands and saying, ""But they were such a lovely family! What happened to poor Jem?"""
1,Unable to get close to the characters,Sister Crazy is a story about a middle child who adores her siblings. She be-friends them with their quirky personalities and thrives on their presence in her life. I could not finish this book because I couldn't find the thread that binded the chapters together. I couldn't find the reasoning why they moved around alot or why the main character is actually crazy. I want to realistically assume that it is a genetic disease because her mother is mentally unstable not because her siblings went on with their lives and left her to find her own life.
2,Not what I expected,"After I saw Gall Force: Eternal Story (actually that was the first anime I ever saw - and what I think was spectacular) I'm disappointed in its successors. The story got worse and worse during Destruction and Stardust War, but I kept telling myself that they are only link and preparation to the follow-ups. I actually quite liked Rhea Gall Force, which best part was that people had to get to the very edge of complete destruction to realize that their ideas of the right way prevented them ever to live in peace. But from Earth Chapter I the story is simply nothing. They just put the character together without reason (especially in New Era), and even the quality of the animation doesn't live up to the original series. If you are a desperate Gall Force fan then buy it, else I don't recommend this."
3,hard cover,"Received timely, book was not in very good condition. book contents fell out of cover. was able to glue book back in cover but still not in good condition as stated in review when i ordered it."
5,my love,My love for the dark side and for the love of good these short stories were some of the best I've ever read when it comes to vampires. The magic in the air with is book was sizzling good. hope all who reads it enjoys has much as I did
2,Not as fun as other Axis and Allies,"This game leaves little to the imagination. Unlike the other versions of A&A I've played, this one gives no room for any kind of strategy to the players. Bottom line, this game is not worth forty dollars. If you are going to spend money on an Axis and Allies game, buy either the World Version or Pacific."
1,Content vs quality,The content of course is excellent. The pages are reminiscent of recycled newspaper and very cheesey. Sorry but I was really dissappointed as the story is truly a keeper.
2,A redundant and unimpressive read,"I have a few thoughts to share regarding this book, especially considering its higher than average rating.In addition to this book, I also wanted to read ""How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life"" for some time now. Our local used bookshop had the previous and not the latter, so I picked it up.My honest opinion is, don't waste your time, unless you're easily impressed or have truly never read anything on the subject matter before. I still intend to read the aforementioned book, but I sincerely feel that this particular book is, for the most part, a waste of time. You can ascertain all the information from the prologue and epilogue. I found the author's writing style dry and uninteresting (which is surprising, because it IS such an interesting subject matter) and quite redundant at times."
4,Piece of cake,"Direction were clear, and the hitch fit perfect, but hardware kit should inlude a set of washers to shim out the connection between the bumper and the frame to make up for the thickness of the hitch bracket."
5,Rare ep of Madonna classics.,"First off you get the full 12"" mixes of ""True Blue"",""Everybody"" and Papa Don't Preach"" but the real find is the 9 minute dub of ""Everybody"". This is a really rare mix and worth every penny for it. This cd like I stated before is full of classic early Madonna tracks a very good buy."
3,Too many rules,"I bought Risk Godstorm for my 13 year old son (and our family) to play. I WISH I would have started with Classic Risk. This game was pretty cool with all of the gods and underworld, but WAY too many directions. It took us more time to figure out the rules than anything else. Quality game materials and pieces- could be fun if you just played classic risk on it. If you already know the rules of Risk and want something a bit more - this could be for you. I have played Risk before and this version seemed more ""luck"" than ""strategy""."
2,Heritage Hill Jar,"The glass shape was lovely, but the lid was cracked when I opened it. Unfortunately I had discarded the billing information before I noticed the hairline crack."
3,Good but pricey....,"Good product. As advertised/described, however price was a little higher than I could get locally."
2,no seal,"good glass, but this one doesn't have a seal as I assumed. so don't store food unless your name is Mr. Fred"
4,Very Useful & Very Pretty,"I looked for canisters for a LONG time. None were big enough for my 1-cup measure or a whole bag of flour....very annoying! The 3-qt size holds a whole 5-lb bag of flour. Plus it looks very nice sitting out on my counter (a la The Barefoot Contessa's kitchen)! They're easy to clean and since they're clear, it's easy to see when I need to buy more flour! I have different sizes for sugar and other pantry staples.I would buy them again in a heartbeat!"
4,Love these,"Wife didn't have a convenient place to keep sugar and flour on the counter...so I was not getting many homemade cakes and breads. I fixed that by buying two of these. Now there's no excuses, it's right there on the counter and makes life easier for her, and me fatter around the middle. Happy wife = happy life... and lots of good baked goods too. BTW, the lids are not airtight, but if you bake a lot, this is not a problem. The opening size is sufficient to use a small, round scoop."
4,Would make a good cookie jar.,"The quality and price seem OK on this product. It reminds me of a cookie jar. It isn't fancy, but it looks OK. The top just rests on the jar. I bought it to make kefir in, mostly, and that's what I'm using it for right now. It seems like it's worth the price."
2,smaller than I thought,"It came on time and was undamaged, but was much smaller than I thought it would be. It has a nice seal on it and was very close to the one my grandma had but it was a gift for my mom. I was disappointed."
3,Much bigger than I thought...,And the lid doesnt fit on well. It kinda just sits on top. But it gets the job done. I store candy in it.
5,great gift,This was a great gift to my wonderful neice who is now vegetarian. She was thrilled to receive it.
4,Love the food,I bought this book because I was looking for a way to add more healthy foods to our menue. It has been a great resorce for me. I like her cooking tips and the emince number of recipies makes it like a treasure hunt everytime I sit down to brows through it. I am a serious cook with a large family to please and I need lots of different recipies to try to keep me interested in cooking.[...]
3,Not for cooks who are short on time,"I think this book offers a wide variety of interesting vegetarian options. The recipes that I have prepared have turned out well. (I have made a corn and lima bean cobbler and pasta with beans and pesto.)However, this is not the book for anyone who works and feels the pressure of time mid-week. The recipes are really time consuming to make. (I am an experienced cook and I am familiar with the techniques referenced and I have the equipment.) For example, Ms. Madison does not allow for the use of canned beans but assumes that you will begin by soaking dried beans.I also think that the instructions are sometimes less than clear. For example, she will tell you that canned tomatoes can be preferable to fresh. But, her instructions tell you to use 2 fresh tomatoes and she does not tell you how that equates to a canned tomato quantity."
3,"Good overview, bad on details.","The strength of this book is that it gives you a great overview of different vegetables, grains etc. and the variety of things that can be done with them. On the negative side, the instructions often lack detail. For example, she might tell you to heat oil and saute a particular ingredient, but neglect to tell you how high the heat should be. Also, if you tend to like highly spiced food, many of her recipes are totally bland and really need to be spiced up. For every real ""winner"" in the book, there have been 2 or 3 things I wouldn't bother making again."
3,A bit overwhelming...,"While I thought a number of recipes in this book were great - for the most part I found it overwhelming. There is just SO much in this book that if you are looking for a quick recipe, this probably isn't for you. I'm no gourmet, and therefore, found this cookbook a bit difficult at times. However, if you truly love to cook, I'll bet this is one book that would make a great addition to your collection."
3,No Nutritional Information!!!,"Having read numerous glowing reviews of this cookbook, I bought it through the mail. However, if I had first looked at it in a bookstore, I probably would have passed it over. I am extremely disappointed that no nutritional information of any kind has been included. Particularly beacuse one of my biggest reasons for eating a mainly vegetarian diet is for the health benefits. It is truly disappointing in this day and age, when nutritional info is becoming a must and given that this cookbook is termed a modern classic. People are becoming more educated! Give us the information to make better choices."
5,"Delicious, simple recipes","Madison's book uses everyday ingredients in novel ways. One of my favorite recipes is the root vegetables with a tahini dressing. Rutabagas, beets, and turnips doused with a tahini dressing and set in a bed of beet greens makes a wonderful alternative to the typical potato salad, but is every bit as good. I would have passed those veggies by in the market, but now seek them out. Other vegetarian cookbooks have wonderful but fat heavy (think cheese and nuts) recipes. Madison's recipes highlight the wonders of vegetables themselves."
4,recipes look good,"I've tried a couple of recipes which turned out good (the curried quinoa tumbers are good and the berry corn coffee cake is delicious, also the oatmeal buttermilk pancakes but I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg so my toddler would eat it), but many recipes call for ingredients which aren't easily available, like juniper berries or rose water."
3,Tries do to too much,"Though Madison's knowledge and abilities are obviously unparalleled, sometimes the best chefs aren't the best cookbook authors. Don't get me wrong: this encyclopedic volume is an impressive piece of work. But too often the recipes are just workhorse recipes. And Madison's recipe-writing style can be a bit vague, esp. for beginners.All in all, I wish she focused on doing a few things very well instead of doing too many things adequately."
3,A good reference book but too basic,I agree that this is a good reference book for vegetarian cuisine. However many of the recipes are rather basic and boring. Not a great book if you're looking for something new and exciting to spice up your vegetarian cooking or do some real vegetarian entertaining.
4,Good video for Richter fans,"I love Richter's work. I still remember how exiting it was to see a display of his abstractions at the top of the stairs as I was visiting his retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern art about ten years ago. Like Cézanne's works, they seem to emit some kind of like from the inside of the work.This video is good insofar as it shows him painting and offers some sense of his career. It isn't nearly as robust as the one Corinna Belz did in the 1990s, when she interviewed him extensively. Perhaps it is unfair to look at them comparatively.I think Richter fans will like the film, but it did seem too long and at times a bit plodding."
5,Loving it,this book was well within the scope of my expectations and was well written and comprehensive and inspiring. I shall rate this one a keeper.
1,kick the tires,"...just a suggestion. While you are out there shopping for a vehicle to journey into enlightenment with be sure to do a little independent research. Kick the bleeping tires. If someone tries to sell you an eckan-car to journey into the heart of life with use the same common sense you would use in buying a car. Dont take all at face value or you may pay dearly. But thats life, isnt it? Live and learn.Most of us use less sense in choosing a religion than we do in choosing a car. Think. Doubt. Challenge. Its ok."
4,Quit comparing albums!,"""Open Season"" not only boasts two of the best songs of the year (""It All Ended On An Oily Stage"", ""Please Stand Up""), but also some of the best lyrics and production of any record so far in 2005. Comparing their debut to this album is not only silly, but shows that most people just want more of the same. Instead of going with a formula and duplicating ""Decline"", the band opted to make a classic pop record that has more in common with prime era Psychedelic Furs than early Echo & The Bunnymen. It's truly a stunner of an album from the beautiful second track ""Be Gone"" to the album's epic closer ""True Adventures"", this one grows better with each listen. Those wanting another post-punk noise fest need go elsewhere...."
2,Horrid Vocals,"I made the mistake of checking this album out. If you like Indie Rock and want to know more about bands that make experimental music,then this is for you. I dread the vocals cause they are annoying,weak,indifferent. The melodies seem to playing altogether but have no direction,nor goal. If you like Indie Rock then check this out.Why did I bother to check this album out? I like to hear everything and give most things a shot. Track1 is easily the best on this disc. Track 2 starts and the forced vocals kick in.God Bless MusicSorry,this is really horrid.PS - I suggest Modest Mouse ""Lonesome Crowded West"""
5,hot as hell,This album is nice better than all of his albums put together. Go and cop this album ASAP.
1,What is this???,I'm the person profiled here. This information is incorrect and woefully out of date.
3,wiggly rattle,"I thought this was a dog toy as I was looking for puppy toys was in pet dept, can a dog play with this it says for babys"
4,Giggler did supply some giggles!,"Length:: 1:18 MinsVaughn likes the giggler! One star is deducted because he spat up on it and it doesn't make the noise any longer. They should have considered this possibility. He liked the noise, the look and the shape (easy to grip)."
4,Does the job.,"It does the job that it is designed to do. It slides in to the receiver without a problem, holds the ball correctly, and holds enough weight to do the job. I have the ball positioned to be facing up when the ball mount is in the ""upside down"" position. This gives the hitch a two-inch rise and puts the ball on my old Explorer at the exact right height to hitch to most medium-sized utility trailers."
5,Fins Up for Dolphins at Daybreak,"My name is Grant. I am in third grade. Last week I read DOLPHINS AT DAYBREAK because it looked like a really exciting book. DOLPHINS is my favorite Magic Treehouse book so far. I have already read VIKING SHIPS AT SUNRISE and CIVIL WAR ON SUNDAY. I would give all of the Magic Treehouse books I have read 5 stars, but I like DOLPHINS best because I love dolphins and the submarine adventure was really exciting!!!Here's a bit of what happened: Annie was curious about the mini-submarine and talked Jack into exploring it. Inside the sub Annie pushed the wrong button and it started to go down to the bottom of the sea. They saw an Octopus, which started to grab the submarine...they also saw a hammerhead shark...That's all I will tell you or it will spoil the story for you."
1,What is the deal with the price?,"My favorite show...but what's the deal with the price for this collection? $144 for the first four seasons when you can get them individually for around $30 each. Order them individually, get free shipping, save some money and it's still just as funny, even funnier if you take the money you save and put it toward the 5th seaon. Great show, stupid price."
1,What a gyp,"This item does not come with the vertical bars, it's the shelves by themselves, even though the product description says otherwise. I had to contact amazon and work something out because I felt so gypped. Just the shelves by themselves are 6 dollars at home depot, and since ther's only 2 in the box, that means you could get this at home depot for 12 dollars. It's not am,azon's fault though, the manufacturer is at fault. Amazon is the besty site in the world, but they need to get this product off of their website."
3,basics only,As a new mom this book is good for basics but light on details. I foundmyself having to buy other books once my son was ready for solids.I also felt the information jumped around a lot; it would have been nice to have it organized more month to month rather than topic to topic.Not a bad choice but don't expect to be your only book on food.Good luck!
1,Overpromises what you'll find on it,"I regret buying this book, since it promised to cover different topics, providing lots of different meals ideas, and it is mostly theoretical and has almost no recipes. If you need theory buy this book, but common sense, obvious theory. If you want ideas for your babies meals look for something else."
3,"good, but not the best for Curt 1 1/4 hitch","I purchased this product to tighten a Curt Class I - 1 1/4 inch hitch to an Allen Sports 532 RR (three-bike) bike rack. This product installs and tightens from the bottom. You have to use a crescent wrench as well as ratchet wrench to tighten it. I found another metal hitch clamp that has two bolts that tighten from the side. Much more convenient than this one. The two-bolt clamp also can clamp onto the bike rack (re-tighten) when the bike rack is removed from the hitch. This keeps the clamp with the bike rack. I think it works better because the tightening mechanism is from the side, with two bolts instead of one from the bottom. The two-bolt (not available on amazon.com) is also designed for the Curt 1 1/4 inch hitch, which has a larger, 2 1/4 inch end collar."
5,So Glad I Bought This Item,"This is really simple to install and uninstall -- just slip it on and tighten the bolts. I've used it in conjuction w/ my cargo carrier and it makes a world of difference. No more constant banging around of the carrier whenever I hit small bumps on the road. Ahhhh, no more irritating noises. No reservations about this purchase."
1,Rip Off,"The lower half of this dress is made of plastic with a very sheer top half. It's like wearing a thin plastic tablecloth. With that in mind, it is extremely overpriced and embarrassing. You would be embarrassed to wear such a piece of junk to a party. You might sit down and it would tear. Save your money and don't buy this."
3,Not made properly.,The sash is sewn in the side seams of the dress right under the breast. I will take it apart and lower it to the waist. Other than that the hat has some kind of spots on the brim. Hopefully I can get that out.
5,Great Book,I wish there would be a sequel to the sequel Roland and Carr did. It would be a very interesting series.
2,No Pulse,"Echo Heron was a nurse. Echo Heron appears to read a lot of Dave Barry. Echo Heron moved to Monserrat (sp?) and has a relative named Adele. So she thought, ""Can I write a mass market thriller with these things I have?"" And she did. Her heroine's name is Adele Monsarrat. The setting is a hospital, among a nursing staff. Swinging wildly between required scenes of carnage and suspense (which are anything but) and pop-culture filled extravaganzas of hyperbole found only in Mr. Barry's writing, this novel floats in a netherworld of authorial cheekiness where Heron wants us to see how cutely she can write and yet take her novel seriously as a mystery. Heron refers to Stephen King innumerable times, and while I've recently become disenchanted by Mr. King's writing, I would highly recommend you take up a multi-volume compendium of his work before laying hands on this lifeless husk."
1,Glaring technical errors guarantee you'll not get hired,"I thumbed through this at Borders, and I had to post commentary here to keep people away. The errors just in the web section were enough.""What are ways to emphasize text""? they ask in the web section. ""Use the Blink tag""?!?They also refer to TCP/IP as a generic name for a suite of protocols such as SMTP, HTTP and DNS. Wrong wrong wrong.On the other hand, I figure that if someone is buying this book to scam their way into a job that they don't know anything about, perhaps the incorrect answers are what they deserve."
1,The questions are junk!,"As a MCP, I was asked to review the VB5 section and found over half of the questions didn't prove anything other than you knew the answer to the question. They don't have anything to do with knowing how to program business solutions in VB. Many of the questions have wrong answers."
1,Poor,"This book [is bad]. Poor editing. Poor questions for VB, C++, Java and SQL. Many wrong and poor explanations and answers.I have no idea about Mainframe, Cisco etc sections.Only ASP section is worth reading with a comprehensive coverage of the topic."
1,Do you want that in plastic?,"Hey, I like large breasts and erotic artwork as much as the next guy, but Kevin Taylor's work is not particularly good or imaginative and all his women look like they should sue their plastic surgeons for doing such a LOUSY job on their breat implants! Sure, drawing are fake, but do the characters have to also LOOK fake?"
5,P-51 Mustang,"This is a top-notch, well engineered kit. If you are patient and follow the instructions carefully, the finished model will be a beauty. The kit is well worth the money. The most remarkable thing though, is Guillow's customer service department. Since I haven't done one of these kits in 50 years, I had a few questions which I e-mailed to Guillow. Not only did Susan in customer service respond quickly but she explained everything perfectly and gave great advice. I was so impressed with the model and Guillow's customer support that I bought 3 others and am looking forward to assembling them for my grandsons. I highly recommend Guillow models. Remember though, you do have to be patient and avoid the temptation to hurry finishing the model."
4,A Sideman Remembers.,"Kenny Gill played in Davis' band and got to know the politician/singer personally. Gill's book is valuable because he captures the human side of Jimmie Davis very well, particularly his humor. A very enjoyable read and one recommended for those who want to gain insight into both Davis and country humor."
3,Impossible to rate at this time,"At this time, I cannot rate this service except to say that the ording process was easy. I ordered this book for my grandson who is currently serving in the Middle East. His location recently changed and was told his mail would be forwarded to his new post. I assume his relocation is the reason he hasn't received the book as of this date (one month later). It sometimes takes 4-6 weeks for delivery. Will rate this when I have confirmation of the delivery."
4,Does a good job,"I had no idea what to expect in a juicer. This is easy to use and does a good job. As with most of these things the cleanup is a bit much, but if you want really fresh juice it's worth it."
4,Juicer,"I had never used a juicer before buying L'Equip. This product is easy to clean and easy to use. However, putting a bag on the back cup where the pulp is extracted helps or it could be a lot messier. Someone who works for the company should probably think about product development to generate new revenue streams. No one wants to clean this thing out. I would purchase additional bags if reasonably priced. They don't have to be plastic bags, but having less parts to clean is a plus in my book. I actually enjoy using the product."
5,Liked this juicer,"L'quip Mini Pulp Ejector Juicer is a good value, it's well made and juicing is easy. Cleaning isn't a problem, I put a bag in the back to avoid messes (sometimes the pulp, however, gets on the counter). I use a toothbrush to clean the filter area. Carrots and celery are the easiest to juice. This is my first juicer and the comments made on this website helped, so thanks for the feedback."
3,Watchface too small for a man.,I got this as a gift for my husband but he was not thrilled as feels the face is too small to look like a Mens watch. I agree.
5,Extremely Unique,"Before I start, I must say that this book is not meant to be considered a reference in any way. It is simply a beautifully photographed story greatly spiced up with mythology and spirituality. I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a really unique coffee table book."
3,"Good characters, fast paced, weak ending...","I liked it. I liked the protagonist. I like the fast paced narrative and true dialogue. The only problem that I had with this novel is the ending. The easy answer for ending a complicated mystery is to just kill everyone off. Yet, in order to maintain the integrity of the protagonist, all the bad guys have to kill each other off. This works, if a traditional ""Mexican standoff"" can be constructed in dramatic fashion, but that is not the case here. Frankly, everything was wrapped up in too neat of a package for me."
5,The Best Album Ever,"James Taylor is a dynamo singer songwriter. ""Shower the People"" and ""Up on the Roof"" are fantastic songs. All of them are. This was my childhood and I am so glad he's got this non-live set out now. Why are ""Never Die Young"" and ""Her Town Too"", two huge hits not on this? All in all a great purchase though."
2,Great Material Ruined by Excess Compression,"this cd has almost everything you could want from a J.T. best of, however the sound is extremely loud...almost unplayable, if you spin it for longer than 20 minutes, you will have a headache and frayed nerves....I had to get rid of mine for that reason; also, the swearing in ""steamroller blues"" is edited, what the hell for? You may be best served by the original greatest hits cd, while that one cuts off at 1976, thus omitting the Columbia hits, the sound is fantastic, and ""steamroller"" is unedited...that's, in fact, what I did"
4,"Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda","In answer to the question in my original review, these songs have been remastered (although you can't tell that from the outer CD cover- I'm surprised they aren't hyping that up since it's often a selling point for even non-audiophiles). I've actually lowered my review by one star. The material on here is great, but I'm not sure why JT's ""Best of"" bascially ends in the 70s on this disc. He has put out plenty of great, if lesser known, songs in the 80s, 90s and 00s, and only one is included here. I don't like to base reviews on what's lacking, but in this case its pretty evident. Regardless, if you want a good sampling of JT's well-known songs and a few album cuts, or you want upgraded sound from your original Greatest Hits collection, you can't go wrong with this set. I'd recommend buying the Greatest Hits 2 for some of the good 80s and 90s stuff..."
4,i cant believe i liked it,this was great. reminded me of a karp book. not a scifi fan but great story...murder mayhem and lots of laughs. if somebody had proofed for typos would have made for a easier read and another star.
3,Flat,"The story never builds up. The action remains flat and there is no sense of mystery or anticpation. I stopped reading the book about 20 pages before the end just when things were resolving. I just could not go on. Then I forced myself read the last 20 pages to see if I was wrong, to see if the action would pick up. It does not, the book ends with a thud. It clearly feels written by a woman, lacking testosterone such books need."
1,Total frustration even for a historic ballet lover,"I'm a big fan of Maya Plisetskaya and was willing to buy anything that might present even portions of her fabulous dancing. I knew this was an incomplete ballet because it was only 88 minutes of a 3 hour ballet, but not only was it cut up, the music was not synchronized with the snippets of dance that were included. Different dances are popped into and out of and intercut with shots of audience members who were clearly pre-selected. There are very few of Maya's dances on screen and not one is shown in its entirety. I have to confess that I didn't watch the whole thing because it was making me tear my hair out after about 40 minutes. What a disappointment! Only buy it if you're interested in seeing Soviet society and not dance."
4,Too many views of audience,"The dancing was incredibly beautiful. Plisetskaya is one of the greatest ballerinas in ballet history. However, there was too much unnecessary focus on the audience. I wanted to see dancing -not the audience."
3,Not Stephin's best stuff,"a few good songs, but a lot that don't live up to his usual impeccable standards."
2,Looks nice but not worth the hassle.,"Curtain rods pull apart whenever you open or close the drapes. I needed the 108"" rods so the telescoping was a real problem. I hate the telescoping aspect of rods anyway since the rings never want to slide easily of the joint of the two. I ended up buying two sets for each window so I could butt the thicker rods up to each other without exposing the thinner rods but that doubled the cost and still did not entirely eliminate the problem of the rods pulling apart. At least now when you open the curtains they don't fall down, you just have to push the rods back together before the rings will slide over the rod easily. If I had to do it all over again. I would not buy these rods. I love the way they look but they are a real pain. I would return them but I've already drilled the holes in my walls...."
1,disappointment,"although the drapery hardware looks nice, it breaks VERY easily and I still haven't replaced it... too bad, they are pretty!"
2,"Songs - great, CD recording - a horrible muddy mess!","Some great songs here, BUT the sound quality is horrible. When the harmonies/guitars come together in a song, the recording gets super fuzzy, flat, distorted & muddy. I've made better copies with my old cassette recorder proped up against the speaker! The bonus radio mixes strangely have a much improved sound quality. Why can't the rest of the album be ""bonus track"" quality?This album needs a serious tweeking by competent recording engineers, but sadly it probably ain't going to happen."
4,Great music. Lousy recording.,"I actually have the original vinyl version of this. The songs are great, but the recording/engineering is horrible. The album was purchased as a close-out, you know, where they punch a hole in the album's sleeve and then try and sell it for less. I'm glad I bought it and am glad it's now on CD. But I can't understand why the recording is so muddy. I've heard a few recordings that Hughie Thomasson made in later years (Diablo Canyon, So Low) and they seem a little muddy too, so maybe he just liked over-the-top recordings."
4,Amazingly good for what it is...,"I'm more of a military history geek than a horror movie fanatic, so I approached this movie from that angle. Actually, I was quite impressed with this film. It has some of the best trench warfare footage I've seen and the uniforms and equipment used are all dead-on perfect for 1917. It's not a gore-fest gruesome flick, more of a suspense thing, although there are some fairly gruesome scenes, so this isn't for kids. Given the budget they had to work with, this is an outstanding little movie, and I'd highly recommend it to any WWI history buff."
5,The bunker from the twilight zone,"This British flick a pure success, excellent, excellent movie for those who appreciate a good thrill. This is not your typical horror movie where you have a toothless monster running around killing people. No, this movie is much better than that; it's set to have an unidentified villain, one with supernatural prowess, one that is pure evil. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through. You are breaking your brain trying to decipher what is going on, is the unit dead? Have they crossed a parallel dimension? Are they in hell? Are they in some sort of purgatory? Was it the gas and they are all hallucinating??? Who is the German soldier? How did this bunker become so evil??? Whoa Nelly so many questions and little answers, this will lead to one's own interpretation, and that's what a good movie should do, it should make you think!!! Genius film, just genius"
1,Stopped working after 1 month,"The phone thought it was constantly off the hook and just kept timing, the switch that hangs the phone up on the hand set stopped working.Cheap phone."
2,An Ironic Coda to Keaton's MGM Career,"""What! No Beer?"" (1933) is a terribly uneven Prohibition-era comedy with some classic Buster Keaton moments undercut by the irritating verbiage of Jimmy Durante. Despite his alcoholic condition (evident in several scenes), Buster makes the most of his non-Durante sequences - recreating the ""Seven Chances"" climax with beer barrels replacing boulders. Though a box-office hit, MGM fired Keaton for his uncontrollable drinking and the comic legend never starred in another Hollywood feature. Regardless of the sad ironies associated with Keaton's life and career, ""What! No Beer?"" is worth a look - just fast-forward past the Durante segments."
3,Poor Buster!,"Not one of my favorite Buster movies, although as I've said before, I can't get enough Buster. The poor man was so ill at this period of time, and you can see it: sometimes it seems like it's all he can do to remain upright.I've read many reviews of this film that seem to mock Buster's alcoholism, which I think is downright nasty. Put yourself in his place.But the WORST thing about this film is the MGM-teaming of poor, ill Buster with (gawd) Jimmy Durante. Polar opposites, but not the kind who have chemistry. I'm surprised poor Buster managed to get off ANY lines at all with that jumping bean, Jimmy."
5,Much better than it's reputation.,"Despite being considered a flop by it's creative team, this is the one of Sondheim's ""lyrics only"" musicals I return to most often. It's melancholy charm is underlined by Rodgers' highly hummable tunes combined with Sondheim's reluctant lyrics. They are partly bitter and partly forced ""happy"". I love it."
2,HOOK PAD WILL NOT HOLD SANDER PAD,"HOOK PAD ONLY LASTED TWO YEARS, SANDING PAD WILL NOT STICK TO SANDER, HAVING TROUBLE FINDING REPLACEMENT PAD. NOT SATISFIED WITH SANDER, DEWALT MUCH BETTER."
4,Surprising,"I was surprised by this book and the woman in it. I was totally prepared not to like her. Then, the more I read, the more I liked and understood her. I can usually tell how a story will turn out, but this one had me guessing. I like that.Sandy"
3,Not the correct cable for MW1 remote,Note that this is not the correct cable for the Clairion CMD6 receiver connecting to the MW1 remote. The correct cable is MWRXCRET.
1,"WRONG ITEM, BUYERS BEWARE","I bought this item in october, was unable to install it until spring of this year, realized that the item that they are selling for this ""kit"" is the wrong cable. The Clarion MWRXCRET is the cable you need with the Clarion MW1 remote and the Clarion M309 CD player. Beware if you buy this kit, that you will just be spending more money like me and buying the RIGHT cable. This was my first purchase from AMAZON.com and i am not happy at all!"
4,good and helpful dictionary,I enjoy this dictionary in reading German literature. I find it very helpful. I am only sorry that there is no button for the verbs conjugations on my bookman model and therefore I cannot use this feature.
2,Small Barn Plans,"It's marginally useful with hand drawn, black & white diagrams. You do get a sense of what building a horse barn or shed is all about. There are other reference books out there that deal with the subject in a more polished way though."
4,Nite Ize,"This is a great light for a dog collar or leash at night. It changes color and is easy to see. On the downside it won't stay on for a long time, so by the end of our walks, I'll have had to turn it on again."
4,Amazing for midnight play!,"These frisbees are great to play with in a open field at night, but be warned we always had a little problem keeping the batteries in the disc so I just use a little duck tape on the under side an the they work great!"
4,A hit with a college student,"This is destined for nighttime games in the dorm quad. It lights well, looks cool, and flies as expected. It turns on by twisting a knob on the underside, and it is possible to knock it off when you catch it. Still, it's a simple matter to turn it back on. It's a little more expensive than I would have liked for a product of this type, but it is as described."
3,"Good, could be better.",The switch that keeps the light on could be a bit more robust. Other than that the product is good and I am pleased with my purchase.
5,Flashflight Disc=Fun At Night,"Have been using ours for two years now. Can't say enough about how many hours of fun it has given us. It flies as good or better than any other Frisbee I've used, so there is no compromise. In fact, I tend to grab it rather than other non-light up discs even in day light. Buy it and see!!!"
4,Great book,I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it for anyone interested in rabbit hunting. Has a lot of useful information.
5,Great Artistic Achievement,Loved this album from start to finish. Mark's unusual vocals and phrasing make his peotic lyrics even better. Gary Louris makes an appearance for all you Jayhawk fans.[like me!] Great packaging too.
2,Merely a Southern Baptist apologetic,"This book does a good job of showing how a healthy church must emphasize importance of the authority of God's Word and expounding on that Word. However, if you are not a Southern Baptist, you probably will not enjoy this book. I was hoping this book would be an aid for leaders across a broad spectrum of evangelical churches to assess their health and take practical steps in this area. Instead, about a third of the book is merely a defense of Southern Baptist theology. If your theology is not firmly rooted in Calvinism, then, according to this author, your church will not be very healthy. Some of the other chapters were pretty good on issues such as church membership, but because a third of the book centers on Southern Baptist theology as crucial for a healthy church, it makes the other chapters seem less credible."
1,Yuck!,Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Don't EVER put in your coffee - it will take over the taste with a weird tangy aftertaste. YUCK!!! Never again...
5,Great sugar substitute,"Will recommend this product to those who have high blood sugar and want to have the desired sweetness in their drink, cereal, or other food to be sweetened without the bad effect of sugar."
2,Dent on the roll up hood,"Outside box looks fine and inside bread box got a very noticeable dent on the roll up hood piece. I don't think it's from shipping and I don't like to deal with the returns, so I put some cute stickers over it to cover up the dent. The bread box itself is beautiful just like the picture."
2,not what i throught it was,"the house had two many opennings,the top kept popping off the house was more translucent than i throught the hooks that came with the house would not work and my hamster did not like like it she went it twice and the top kept comming off,and not only i could see her but she could also see me and she did not like that so i ended up putting gray tape all around the house and i also had to cover all the opennings but one because the bedding kept comming out of the house and now see is happy,because she can not see me unless she comes out the house would not buy again."
5,Important Life (and Sailing) Lessons Revealed,"What a wonderful book, by a courageous woman. As I read the book, I felt that I was there with her during her struggles and triumphs. And the ending is very positive and doesn't leave the reader hanging. She's overcome a great deal in life at a young age, and has gone on to become a very solid and interesting wife and mother, I suspect. Yes, the book describes a real tragedy, the kind of thing that a sailor prays to avoid. However, there are real lessons to be found, such as equipment and design flaws aboard her boat, as well as the 'human factors' which she discusses openly. I've made purchases and upgrades to my boat (I liveaboard and cruise fulltime) based on her book and her lecture at the Annapolis sailboat show. Just buy the book, and you won't be sorry!"
5,This is a great soundtrack. have listened to it over & over,Great Movie & Music. Love to listen to the soundtrack in the car. Oh What A beautiful Morning favorite Song
3,Too much added material,"This a gem of an album with too much added material ""mixed in"" with the original recording. If you want to make a CD copy of the original songs only, the ones that flow into ballets don't all end smoothly. The added material should have been at the end or on another CD, like the Sound of Music."
5,if you're reading this....,"You already know about this game. I play this game on a laptop that is over 7 years old (I do this for the safety of those who use my main computer) All of the games are vulgar, offensive, stupid, and probably cause brain damage but I still enjoy playing it for the simple fact that it's fun. Honestly all of these games are more of a novelty then anything else. Plot, character development, dialogue... blah blah blah you can piss on people and use cats as silencers.If you read about this game and want to buy it... just do it because if you are reading the reviews you are interested and therefore you are sick enough to play."
3,Tristan and Isolde...Y-a-w-n...,"This is the second in Rosalind Mile's Tristan and Isolde novels. The first was ""Isolde, Queen of the Western Isle."" The story of Isolde and Tristan continues as Isolde prepares to succeed her mother as Queen of Ireland. Treachery abounds with King Mark, his nephew and Tristan's cousin Andred, and finally with Blanche, another Isolde, Princess of France.The story plods on with Tristan and Isolde losing each other, and finding each other again and again. It is an okay read but the tale is not told with much passion or intensity. The mushy prose expressed by Tristan and Isolde, of their inner thoughts, is at times somewhat nauseating.I've read all of Rosalind Miles novels and this is by far the worst one to date. It's passable read if you have no other book to occupy your time. It is not in the same class of novels as Mile's novel ""I, Elizabeth."" This was a novel that surpassed all my expectations of a captivating, all encompassing novel."
4,Not bad.,"The artwork is entirely from the tv show and doesn't include any originals or from the comics. Much more knowledge included for each date, with more birthdays and international festivals than 2006. May's art is little disturbing though."
3,its ok,"i bought this to use at night, it gives off enough light to slightly light up my 10 gallon tank. and gives off a decent amount of warmth. i recommend this to someone who intends to use it only at night"
2,Video Not Shakin',"I took the instructor's class at a fitness convention and she was great!!! However, the SharQui video was did not meet my expectations. The music was not synchronized with the movements, so the dance moves ended up ""off the beat."" This was very frustrating and annoying. If they could somehow properly ""sync up"" the music, and maybe provide a more intermediate level video, I'm sure it would be awesome."
3,A very basic problem book.,"This book has a set of problems aimed at the beginning player. It would probably be ideal for someone who had _just_ learned the game. I am 26k* on IGS, and I felt that the problems were a little too easy. It would be wrong to say that I learned nothing from this book, but I don't feel I received $15 worth of new information.I would advise anyone who has some experience with go and is considering buying this book to think about starting with volume 2 of the series. If it turns out to be too complicated, you can come back to this one."
4,"Nice, but a beast to assemble!","The fold and store picnic table is very nice and durable. However, it takes 2 people and a lot of time and patience to put it together. Once it's together, though, I believe it will last my granddaughter and her friends for many years to come!"
3,Pain in the neck,"The table works fine, but it is a royal pain to assemble. If you have a 4x4 workbench with access on all sides and a helper it would be tolerable, but without that it is a hassle."
2,Flimsy!,"I was disappointed to find out how flimsy this picnic table bench seats are. We set it up in our basement for my son's birthday party. When there was two kids sitting on one side, you could see the bench seat bow. At the seams on the corner of the bench you could visibly see them wonting to pull apart from the bowing in the bench. These kids are only 2 to 4 that were on it. Definitely within the recommend weight & age limit!!!! Would not recommend! We believe it is unsafe & we are taking it back to the store!"
4,Day Care Teacher Review,I have owned a daycare home for 32 years and purchased many Little Tikes products over the years. This table will better accommodate my six children in care and I expect it will be durable. I have to caution you on assembly...it will try your last nerve! I recommend two people to assemble it and it took me nearly three hours with a little help from my son. I am using one without umbrella for indoors and one with umbrella for outdoors. I'll put that one together tomorrow...ugh!
3,Erotic writing for women...,"It's hard finding decent erotica for women. In this collection, there's sure to be something for everyone... and quite a few things definately not in your taste. The stories (actually, excerpts from complete novels, with the exception of four original tales) are uniformly well-written and entertaining. However, depending on your personal tastes, they are either way too kinky or exactly what you've been looking for.Three stars mostly because there are only a few stories in the collection that ""work"", if you will, for me, but it is certainly not a poor choice if you are looking for some explicit, interesting and fun erotica. A chacon son gout."
5,Recommend,We have the earlier model D680 which is very similar to the D780. The D680 also copies at 16 pages/min and may be used as a printer and fax. Our office uses it mainly as a copier. It is not the fastest but no problems in three years of 5x8 use. Occasionally we use the fax capability when our dedicated fax machine conks out. The D680 uses the same toner cartridge as the D780 and the newer D880. We have to replace the cartridge every month or two. The L50 cartridges can be expensive. We get ours from InfinityImaging.com or Provantage.com.
5,the best stevia,This is the only stevia I buy now. I make sure I do not run out. It is not bitter and only takes a bit to sweeten a lot.
2,No lasting appeal,"When I first bought this album about 2 years ago, I was blown away. The production was amazing, and Eyedea could 'rap fast'. Those two things blew me away back then. Now trying to listen to the album again, I just can't do it. Eyedea never chages up his flow (fast rapping i.e. Twista doesn't mean you are good). The production after listening to high -caliber production i.e. Madlib and RZA (old) cmes off as weak. All that aside, the main point that this Eyedea guy has the WORST voice this side of Eminem. I can't stand that whining after one song. At least other artists like Opio of Hieroglyphics and B-Real can make thier their nasally voices work."
1,Glencoe French a Bord Writing Activities Workbook and Student tape,Workbook would have been very useful if you had sent the tape. Without the tape the book is useless. I'm very disappointed for I did not get what you said you were going to send??
5,Herman's best!,"I don't typically belong to the Jerry Herman fan base, but this score of his is awesome. I am familiar with Hello, Dolly, Mame, Mack And Mabel and La Cage Aux Folles, but this is the only Herman score I find enjoyable throughout. Having the glorious Angela Lansbury singing the bittersweet songs is also wonderful. As this show is one of the celebrated, legendary flops of Broadway history, I assume the book of the show has to take the blame. The score is first rate. Take this from a dedicated Sondheimite;)"
1,Translate Garbage,"The entire line of Lingo translators are difficult to use, full of errors, and the company's support is non-existent. There are very few products that I would classify as a complete waste of money and this is one of them. Please save you money and potential frustration in learning a language or traveling abroad."
1,This is fake Calvin Klein!! Do not buy!,"This perfume only mildly smells like Calvin Klein Escape. The fragrance completely disappears after a few minutes. I've been wearing Escape (the real stuff) for years. This is not real. Do not buy from this seller (Tuccini). If the price seems way too low, there's a reason."
2,Too much narrative .. needs examples,"This is a book that talks a lot about Earned Value in terms of history and usefulness; how it advanced since 1967 C/SCSC to today's EVM standard.To my amazement, unfortunately, this book does NOT show you how to calculate EARNED VALUE. It keeps talking about how to use it to assess progress and predict future progress but it does not show how to get it.This is a MAJOR flaw in my opinion.I finished reading the book and I am disappointed. It needs more examples. There are better books in the market on this."
4,Book has earned it's value!,A great value!! I felt this book provided alot of good in depth information and techniques that I will certainly be implementing. A good buy!
1,Crap,This book like many other PMI books incorporates three elements:-Repeated topics-Dull-Sluggish examplesYou better of spend 20 min on Internet where you will find numerous resources and practical examples for free. There's also an excellent free video posted on YouTube.Don't waste your money.
4,Millionaire meets mayem in madcap romance,"Leanne Banks has done it again. This book is exactly what romance novels should be. It's sweet and sexy, sensual and sensuous. Banks has a real gift for creating characters I'd like to have over for dinner. Where can I meet them, Leanne? And when are they coming back. More, more more!"
4,Tough as nails. Corny as Jiffy.,"Nice and humorous adventure game. Reminds me of the days i would be up till 3AM with Kings' Quest. Realtively attractive graphics. Few minor problems with speech synching. Sometimes the humor is sophomorish, but usually well-delivered. Not too complicated a program, though you may find yourself a little confused at first about what you have to do. Especially if you're a third-person adventure rookie. This program takes for granted the fact some may not be familliar with the different facets of free-roaming graphic adventures. Otherwise, the program runs smooth on a very low-end system. I have come across very few , and very minor, glitches involving a lock-up (during the point where i was changing the graphic resolution fron 640x480 to 1024x768 ) and one point where i lost sound entirely. But, a reboot fixed that, and it never happenned again. Overall, a nice game with few problems. I enjoyed it almost as much s i wanted too."
4,Very nice for the price,"This works well. I wish it was a little more sturdy, but for the price it's hard to complain. It's way better than some. I haven't been able to find a better one for my large sink."
2,"It's white, not stainless steel","The size of this item is perfect. Unfortunately, it's white. I guess it's plastic-coated stainless steel. Definitely not the look I was going for. I could have gone to any local store to pick up a cheap sink protector with the same look."
5,3 stories all for more adventure,"I never was a big fan of romance novels, not saying that this is a romance novel because it isn't but it is a close to one. It's basically a book where you get a happy ending and those are nice with a little bit of love in it. More like it's a love book than a romance novel because not just filled with sex.I got this book because I figured that I could read books by 3 different authors and find out if I liked them as authors. Turns out because of this book, I ended up buying books from all 3 of these authors. I haven't read them all yet but I have at least bought from them. I can't wait to read them and they've got a page or 2 of a book by them so you can get a taste of their book so basically you end up liking it and purchasing it yourself (which is what I did).Very much enjoyed this book and even if it's not christmas you can still enjoy this book. It's not much about christmas at all, just set around that time."
5,Great apricot flavor,"Another Coffee Masters hit! This coffee is rich, full-bodied and very smooth with a light apricot flavor and a hint of cream. Loved every ounce of it. Coffee masters is fresh when it arrives and, with proper handling, stays very fresh until the bag is empty. I will definitely order more."
2,looking at your dreams,This book is a nice addition to the first book: Understanding the dreams you dream. Is not as indepth as the first one but it does answer some questions about interpreting dreams from a Christian perspective. I had higher expectations for its content and was somehow disapointed.
3,What It Tastes Like,"Okay. I tried this because I have had wonderful luck with items from across the pond recently. I'd been wondering about it for a long time. I test tasted this on the following foods: A bacon, cheese, and egg omelette, fried potatoes, and fried bologna. Conclusion: it tastes best on meats. The flavor has a lot of black strap molasses, and is a slow creeper on spicy ( it sneaks up on you). For reference: I hate the taste of Heinz 57 and can eat A-1 off anything! This HP sauce? Too close to Heinz 57 for my liking and has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I won't be purchasing it again unless it grows on me. I believe this product is an acquired taste. I've never been fond of black molasses or black licorice so that's probably why it makes my "" Meh! I can live without it, but it's better than nothing"" list."
4,Works well,"I have an adult boxer who has separation anxiety. He will eat paper products or take articles of clothing, umbrellas, gloves, hats or chew up any boxes or plastic, whatever he can get ahold of when stressed. After a week of wearing the collar he stopped getting into things while I was at work or out for a few hours. Not to say he liked it, he would scratch at it, not sure it itched as much as he wasnt used to wearing a collar all the time. The product arrived in about 3 days after I placed the order so he has been wearing it for 4 weeks. The collar has no odor I could detect. Very happy with the product."
2,Didn't do anything for my dog,"This product did not do anything in the way of appeasing my dog. It was honestly a last ditch effort. He has separation anxiety, that only got worse with the move. He was on a couple of different anti-anxiety medicines, and they weren't helping either. I would not take my dogs reaction as an indication of the abilities of this product. I think he was beyond help. The only this that has mildly helped him, is a walk every morning and evening. So take my review for what its worth."
5,This product works.... but...,"I am a vet student and I have had a ton of success with DAP collars on my pet and on others. It is important for possible buyers to know that these collars are meant to soothe anxious or worried dogs, not dogs experiencing fear. For example, if your dog had a terrible experience as a puppy or is afraid of thunderstorms, this collar alone may not work. Fear in dogs is something that takes time and effort to train out. For example, this might help me feel more calm before a test, but it sure as heck won't help me get over my fear of spiders.If you want to diminish a fear response, try using this collar in conjunction with training. In many cases, seeing a behaviorist can be very very helpful.SHORT VERSION: DAP collars work great on anxious pets, but are not enough on their own with very fearful dogs."
5,Nice and calm....,"I decided to try this at the recommendation of my vet. My 8 yr old blk lab had been leaving 'messes' in our new house and was starting to develop anxiety due to thunderstorms. About 2 wks after wearing the collar, he started to relax and not leave messes inside. Now I have to say, I also have a 5 yr old blk lab and I tried the collar on him as well, unfortunately it did not work as well for him- he is just really hyperactive. I have now been trying a prescription for him. All the same, I am going to keep using the collar for my 8 yr old. I am very happy with the results and I think he is too!!"
4,noticed improvement,"it's somewhat of a pain to get on the dog (hard to slide the collar through the clasp), but we did definitely notice an improvement in our pup. we have a stray, feral dog that we adopted about 6 months ago. she's very shy and timid, and usually spends time in her crate when we're home. about 7-10 days after we put this collar on her she was hanging out in the living room with us pretty much every time my husband and i are in there. for thanksgiving she hung out with my whole family, loud as we were. we purchased two more. it's not going to ""fix"" your dog, but we definitely noticed improvement in her socialization."
1,Lasted 3 weeks,"When I opened the box with this cutting board, I thought- Perfect! Just what I was looking for. Unfortunately 3 weeks after it arrived, I was in the living room when I heard a big noise. I went into the kitchen and the cutting board had spontaneously split completely into two pieces! So now I am back to square one- no cutting board to show for my $35. Clearly, this product is of the lowest quality."
3,More Ignatz Zwakh,"It is years after the events of Dead Girls and Ignatz is still around. He carries with him a bottle with the hastily removed reproductive organs of his love Primavera. He is also on Mars.The nanotechnology plagues seem to be still around but the world is much different. Ignatz is now a Dead Boy. He has been schooled in the art of killing and eating girls.Much of the plot, what little there is, can be confusing. The book is split into seven chapters (the seventh very short). While the chapters each start well, they degenerate into a stream-of-consciousness babble composed of pages-spanning sentences. No real improvement over the first book. I will read the third to complete the series but I have no great expectations."
1,Picture looks better,I purchased this for a family member and returned it when I opened the box. The picture looks much better than the actual item. The eyes are glow in the dark (not listed in description) and makes this item look eerie.
3,sounds like Exodus rejects,"This album sounds like Exodus rejects. If you like Exodus (I do)and gave it 5 stars, you'll probably find this acceptable, and that's the problem: it's more-of-the-same lite. The first half is great background music, but the second half is where the good songs lie. In fact, just buy Legend. Give it 3&half; stars.If you feel that the REAL Wailers are captured by Catch a Fire, and Burnin', then give this 2&half; stars, as the sound is weak but the production is top notch, just what the American pop rock audience wants. The band is on fire, but the writing is lacking, Bob is not singing his best, the I Threes are taking no chances, and the reggae is turned down and the rock is turned up. This probably sold a lot. I like the reggae better when Peter Tosh was around, the music was denser and more mystic, and the beat was more challenging with a real edge."
3,Superb performance marred by overloaded signal,"Open Road is Donovan's finest work, and I've been looking forward to this CD since the CD format started. Sadly, this digital mastering job is seriously flawed by overloaded signal. There is a lot of bass overload on numerous tracks. Quality control was out to lunch. Keep your fingers crossed for a remaster in the US. In the meantime you're better off getting a tape or LP of this wonderful release."
4,Stickers are cool,I am so happy with the stickers I ordered. Price was good and they came quickly. Saved me a trip to the teachers store. Saved me money too! Of course the kids love the stickers.
4,good book,What can anybody say about Samuel Clemens. His books and short stories are always entertaining and fun to read anytime.
1,The Mysterious Stranger,Weird and boreing! I could not wait to finish it. I rushed through it and finished it i two days! Mark Twain must have written this at a very bad time! It sucked!
1,Twain must have had his head up ------somewhere when he wrote this garbage,The title of my review pretty much says it all. Wonder what he was smoking when he dreamed up this discombobulated story. It goes nowhere and makes no point whatsoever.
5,A-MAZ-ING,I love this book! Gena Showalter is one of my favorite writers and I would recommend her books to anyone.
2,Disappointing,"Great premise, lousy execution. The book just never seemed to find good pacing. The end was predictable. This is the second book of hers I have read. The second I have been bored by."
3,Beautiful Shoe,"This shoe is absolutely beautiful but the heel is very high. If you are not used to walking in very high heels, I would not order this."
3,Her first novel,"I read this many years ago and enjoyed it. My only memory of it is that as in some other of her novels, she has a hero who is a scientist (actually in this case a doctor.) Rereading it lately, I am less satisfied with it. It seems that her material got away from her. Her original intention, apparently, was to have the center of the novel the younger brother, a misfit if not actually mentally deficient (at least in the eyes of his family) who becomes a ground-breaking artist. This character is the most interesting in the book.(SPOILER ALERT) But we seem to find the central character ended up being a charming society beauty whose marriage is made for comfort and wealth rather than love, and who is afraid to leave her husband for the young idealistic doctor who loves her.Such a waste! This novel shows Kennedy's promise, but treat yourself to the marvelous ""Lucy Carmichael,"" if you never read any of her other books (which are mostly quite excellent.)"
1,"Brand new replacement battery, dead.","Bought two for my Olympus 510, opened it, charged it, My charger was giving me the green light, but when inserted in my camera it wouldn't even turn my camera on.Follow Up: The second one I bought charged fine, and my camera recognized it with no problem. I will be returning the first one to the manufacturer for replacement."
3,Serves the basic need but not for advanced use,"I was able to pair it up easily with my Motorola V551 phone. But could not pair it up with my PC which has bluetooth. Looks like there is some profile problem.I also agree with other reviewers that it does not fit the ears properly. I use the cord which comes along with this to hang it around my neck.In a nutshell, this is a bargain for thirty dollars if you just need a basic bluetooth handset and don't want to pay much.Update on 08/01/2006: It has stopped working totally after using it for about 6 months, that too when I was using it very infrequently. The earbud came out and after I fixed it back in, it does not work. Though it shows blue blinking lights, and my phone pairs up with it easily, I can't hear any voice in it. So don't waste your 30 bucks and buy something more expensive and durable."
4,Butter Dish,"I bought one of these butter dishes over a year ago, and love it. One of the things that I really like about it, is that you can put the cube of butter on it, and it has tablespoon measurements, so you can easily take only what you need. I also like that you can see through the plastic, and know if you need to get more butter out if need be. My only complaint with it is, that after many, many washings, the blue is starting to come off. At least so far, the measurements aren't coming off. That is my only reason for marking it a ""4"". If I hadn't had this problem, I would have given it a 5 rating. I would like to purchase another one, but the shipping is more than the butter dish! Kind of frustrating."
1,Why is my butter pink?,"This dish turned my butter pink, and the measuring lines washed away with the first wash. Threw it away after a week. Do not buy.Progressive Butter Keeper Dish With Measure Grid"
1,No Good.,I have this butter dish and it sucks! If you leave the butter out and it gets warm enough to melt (summer) it leaks and gets butter all over your counter. There is no lip to keep melty butter contained and the lid doesn't do any good.Don't buy this.
2,Dye ran after washing,"I hand washed the butter dish after I received it in the mail and everything was fine. But when I hand washed it again after the first stick of butter was used up, all the blue dye from the measurement marks and conversion chart began to run. So now it has blue smudged all over it. I will probably try to just get it all off, but that defeats the purpose of having the measurement grid on it which was the reason I bought it."
3,Not Great!,All of the graduated markings eventually wore away. However works as well as any other butter keeper.The big reason I purchased this was for the measurement markings which disappeared.
3,good enough,"i like the measuring aspects...measures both small and large butters. however, i think it would be Extremely beneficial if there was something rough on the base to keep the butter in place...it slides all around, so i always have to push it back in place before cutting it to whatever my recipe calls for. some little bumps like ///// across the bottom would prevent this from happening."
2,Ink not set - rubs off and turns butter pink,"I really like the design of the dish. I wish the ink was set. Unfortunately, it wipes off VERY easily when butter touches it. It turned my butter pink. YUCK!"
1,the blue ink leaks - yuck,So this dish was great... until one day I noticed the blue ink was leaking as I wiped it dry from being washed. Not too appealing to continue using it.
1,Poor Reliability and Warranty,"I have a [...] Sony DVD player. Sony claims a 1 year part/90 day labor warranty. First, the machine simply stopped working after 5 months. Second, to send it in for warranty repair, Sony wants [...] for labor, upfront, plus I have to pay for the cost to ship the item. They don't assess the problem and then give you an estimate, permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through with a repair. Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony. Check out what the warranty, when you purchase. Select a product with 1 year parts and labor. Otherwise, find out what the manufacturer charges for warranty service.Sony will probably charge more for labor for a more complex, more expensive machine. Watch out for deceptive warranty policies."
4,A must for Woodstock fans.,"I bought the vinyl version of this album when it hit the bargain bins in 1973, and I was impressed. There's definitely some good music here, though not the intense highs of the first Woodstock album. All tracks by the Jefferson Airplane and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young are good. For me the high point is Canned Heat's rocker ""Woodstock Boogie,"" which has a ZZ Top sound. This second Woodstock album has a tamer sound than the first, with a lot of acoustic, folk, ballads, and blues pieces. Hendrix's pieces are possibly an exception, but those are all long and relatively uninteresting jams. Melanie sings her heart out on ""Birthday of the Sun,"" although some might object to her strained voice. I actually prefer this live version of ""Marrakesh Express"" to the studio version with organ that sounds overly slick. This album is a must if you're trying to sustain that magical feeling of those 3 days of muddy fun and music."
3,"Ok, stone But....","It is ok as far as cutting, but it will wear quickly and dish on you. It would be easier to use a flat plate and some SC sand paper instead."
2,cooking for two,"This cookbook was ok, but the author mentions ingredients that would be very hard to find. I am not the type of person that likes to shop at a lot of places. My idea of cooking for two is to keep it simple!"
2,Ok...,"I was able to get a couple of recipes out of this book, but did not feel as though it was truly written for the purpose of cooking for two. I was a bit disappointed and felt the recipes were not too inventive."
3,Meet Franz Liszt!,"This book is really not about Chopin. Liszt's writing is exagerated and more often than not, looses focus on the point he was trying to make, that is, writing about Chopin's life. There are very few significant things about Chopin here, but there is a lot to be found if the book is read from another point of view. If read as a biography it is, indeed, disapointing, but if you see it as a way of getting closer to the personality of Liszt and the circumstances of his time, it's pretty illustrating. In a way, this book shows what Romanticism is all about. So, don't expect a great biography, it's more of a private-joke for romantics, but a very interesting one.I would recommend it only if you keep in mind that this book will tell you a lot about Franz Liszt, the educated barbarian, but very little about Chopin --or about music for that matter--."
4,For Genesis Collectors,"Perhaps the best reason to buy this video is for the videos featuring Ray Wilson. To my knowledge this is the only DVD that features these from the under-appreciated Calling All Stations release. Most of the other videos on the DVD have been released in previous collections.I am a devoted Genesis fan, and think that other devotees will appreciate this omnibus collection. There is, as another reviewer has pointed out, a problem with the sound levels on the DVD. I don't know the ins and outs of it, but it seems as if the volume fades in and out to avoid peaking-out.Still, it is a nice collection, and I am glad that I bought it. It should, of course, be supplemented by one of the band's live performances (e.g.Genesis - The Way We Walk (Live in Concert),Live at Wembley Stadium) andGenesis - The Genesis Songbook. Fans will be glad to have it."
5,Amazing,Our most favorite comedian stand up ever he is so hilarious does look like it by the cover but what d they say don't judge a book by its cover in this case a movie! Must see!!!! So funny!!
4,good little camera,"In bright daylight the FE-130 takes bright crisp pictures with vivid colors. At night, the flash provides plenty of light at medium to close range. The ""night mode"" (which keepts the shutter open for several seconds while snapping a quick flash) is a neat feature that I've enjoyed using as well.While not the smallest of the subcompacts, it is surprisingly small and light, and comfortably fits in a jacket or even shirt pocket.There is no memory included, so you'll need to buy an XD card, preferably 512 mb or more.The camera runs on 2 AA's which is convenient, and I've been getting around 50 or 60 shots in (with heavy use of the flash) between replacements, which is not bad for a couple of measly AA's.The included Olympus Master software is intuitive and easy to use.The display is smallish (2 inch), which is a bit of a nuisance if you are used to a larger one but is clear and bright.Overall, I'm happy with this camera."
5,superb little gems,This a wonderful first collection. I bought it on a whim and I can't wait to see more.
5,"The first,the best and should have been the last","Excellent, heart warming film. This only came out on VHS at the beginning of the DVD age. Now here we are in the age of blue ray while they're already developing, supposedly, an even higher quality format and we get this on DVD, in a club edition at that. That's why it's priced so high here as it wasn't on release to the retail outlets. Very good quality video, (better than the VHS anyway) but could have used some color restoration. Although the box states full screen this is definitely in wide screen and all the better for it. I'm sure, given the choice, kids of today would much prefer this version over Homeward Bound 1 or it,s follow ups if only they were to see this version first."
1,speechless,"I'm not one to follow trends but with all the hype, I had to see for myself what was so great about this little book. I couldn't believe this author wrote what he did. Is he truly a Christian? He turned a simple prayer into a list of selfish requests for wealth and other material things. Yes, God will bless us, we just have to ask but it is according to His will, not ours. Not only that, but blessings may not come in the form of material things but in spiritual things. And the Bible clearly says to leave this world behind and want only the treasures of Heaven. Wealth, land, popularity, all those things will mean nothing in the end and to write a book about praying for such things, goes against everything I know as a Christian. God will provide for our needs. I'm afraid this book will mislead many people and cause them to lose faith when their prayers aren't ""answered""."
3,God keeps his promises,"To get the impact of Jabez's prayer and the later annilahion of the Haminites and the Amalikites one must refer to Gen.9:18-29, Ex.17:8-15 and Lev. 18:1-29. Ham (Noah's son)didn't just see his Dad (Gen.) There was a shame, a perversion or lust. Ham received a curse for the pervertion. Shem avoided the temptation by not even looking,thus gaining a blessing. The curse and blessing was to remaining generations. Shem's generations of decendants include Abram, Judah, and Jabez. IChron4 says Jabez was honorable (godly). Because of Godly obedience he was blessed. It continued from Shem's blessing. God chose to do this. Ham's decendants included the people of Cannan. (Hamites, Amalikites). ... See Lev. 18:1-29 particularly v.24,29. Also see God's promise to Amalikites in Ex. 17:8-15. The Isralites were just passing through as many other travelers did at that time and were doing no harm. God promises sin brings destruction"
4,The Prayer of Jabez,"The Prayer of Jabez book is a small one that can probably be read in an hour. There is much wisdom in this short space.I cannot tell you how many times I have read the Bible through and yet had never noticed this small prayer. One of the things the book says is when we ask for God's mighty presence as Jabez and the early church did, we will also see tremendous results that can only be explained by the hand of God.I, for one, seek the presence of God and His hand in my life. Prayer is the answer for this. The Bible says God heard and answered Jabez's prayer. We, too, can pray this prayer and many others to ask God's help for everything in our lives.Jeanetta Bearden Pollard author of ""Mrs. Claus Shares Stories From the Heart."""
1,My Will Be Done,"I was horrified by this book. The premise--that if you just repeat this prayer often enough, God will give you exactly what you want--is so not Christian. It's on a par with amulets, charms, and spells, which the New Testament strongly condemns. The idea that you can manipulate God by uttering the magic words is superstitious and selfish, not to mention the complete antithesis of everything Jesus taught. Remember, ""thy will be done""? ""Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will""? And what about that famous Evangelical phrase, ""Let go and let God""? The prayer of Jabez is a step backward, not forward!"
1,Reflects the shallowness of American Christianity,"I can't believe that Christians are being duped into such an unbiblical approach to prayer and the Christian life. The emphasis of the book is too man-centered, focusing on the ""bless ME"" rather than on God. This horrific book also let's the American dream get in the way of the Christian worldview. Wilkerson is so materialistic in this book it is pathetic. To be sure, there are a few places where he claims not to do so. However, he doesn't do that in the book. He speaks from two sides of his mouth.C. H. Spurgeon, on the other hand, preached a sermon on the prayer of Jabez from Chronicles which is God-centered and shuns the materialistic focus of Wilkerson's book. ..."
5,The Prayer of Jabez,"I was fortunate enough to have this book given to me last week-end and consumed it in two days. I must admit that early on my husband and I both felt awkward and a bit ashamed that we should ask for God's blessings as we have witnessed His immense kindness in our lives already. However, after I really began to read I realized, isn't this what we all desire anyway, the favor of God? ... There are just too many scripture references to dismiss the insights here in this book. I would encourage anyone to take what is relative and helpful to you. By the way, Secrets of The Vine is even better!"
1,The perfect book for our sad times,We have a president (note the small p) who spent his entire life having wealth and success handed to him on a silver platter. Now we have a theology that teaches we should sit and wait for God to hand us a new SUV and a bigger McMansion and a greener lawn.I give up on this country.
3,I understand.,"I get what the last reviewer is saying. We are all blessed by God, so there shouldn't be a discussion. But it is those who choose to accept His salvation that matter most to God in the end. After all, if there was one recipient today who deserved more from God through the ""Prayer of Jabez"" than anyone else, it would be Jesus. That is, he should have been a Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, and Samson all wrapped up in one. But God chose to make Jesus's life humble, and as a sacrifice for all. Hence, ""The Lord's Prayer,"" not the Prayer of Jabez."
1,Theologically Devastating,"A bestseller does not necessarily a Christian classic make. Consider the following points:1. If this is a great secret to prayer, then why is it buried in one verse in a genealogy of the Old Testament?2. The book violates the number #1 rule of sound exegesis: A verse cannot mean something today that it didn't mean to the original hearers.3. When the disciples asked Jesus how to pray He surprisingly didn't refer to Jabez. If this interpretation were true, wouldn't Jesus have mentioned it???4. Our problem as the Bible defines it is SIN. Not a need for blessing.5. Didn't Jesus comment on mantra-like repetitions?The botton line: You can't grab one verse in a genealogy and formulate a doctrine around it. This violates all sound theological practice. Save your money or spend it on sound teaching."
1,Nonsensical booklet,"Another ploy from a smart, savvy t author to sell a quick fixer for needy souls. Pity they prey on people's spiritual need and begin a while marketing campaign using one verse of the Bible. Shame on you, money makers!"
1,As if people aren't shelling out enough money...,"""Hmm, people aren't paying enough for this stuff, let's make an up-scaled brat edition!""That's my feeling on this book, which is a cheap shot and making more money off the stupidity of evangelicals in embracing unscriptural teachings like The Prayer of Jabez. (...)"
1,What a Disappointment!,"What a disappointment! I expected an adventure story with a headstrong, female protagonist with a mystery looming on the horizon. What do I buy? An adventure stor with a headstrong, female protagonist with a mystery looming on the horizon THAT IS SOLVED BY HER HUSBAND. Plus, how could Abigail fall in love with a man who has a terrible, ugly lust for her body? He never loved her, never grows to love her, yet she changes and becomes a model wife. It was sickening. Don't read it!"
2,Very Hard to set up,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, I also received this timer as a gift for registering my purchase with Fagor. And too, the battery dropped out of the package when I opened it - I only knew to search for it because the instructions said a battery was included. It was very difficult to install the battery so it would work. I had to push up the little connector strip (under the battery) a few times before the connection would hold when I screwed the battery cover in place. Also, the buttons seem to take extra pressure to work, but I think the alarm is sufficient-just carry it with you to whatever area you plan to be in when you need to hear it. I am assuming Fagor has concluded this item is not worth the purchase price and that is why they are giving them away."
1,DOA,"I got this as a complimentary free gift for registering my ""pressure cooker"". Actually, It was for registering my Induction griddle and 11 inch Induction fry pan, I hadn't purchased or registered a pressure cooker. When I opened the plastic bubble packaging, I heard something drop on the floor. Turns out it was the battery, which was in the package, but not visible. I put the battery into the compartment (correctly, I might add, with + on top, and - on bottom), and nothing....absolutely nothing. Did a reset. Removed and replaced the battery....still nothing. Either the battery, or the timer arrived DOA. Glad I didn't purchase this for the almost $18.00 selling price."
5,Absolutely lovely!,"I was highly impressed with these pearls, especially for the price. I expected them to be fair quality, but they were beautiful, with only minor surface imperfections and a great peacock sheen. Also, they are expertly strung on silk, and strung loosely enought that they fall naturally when worn. Stunning!"
5,The Best!,"I received this as a gift when I started the RN Program from another Nurse. It is a wonderfully done resource! It is great to refer to in Clinical and in class. I often follow along in lecture and find that the pictures and diagrams are better than the ones the teachers have in their PowerPoint (especially the EKG). It is indexed well and I love the fact that it has forms you can copy or write on and easily wipe off with alcohol pad. Also since I use it a lot when I am on the floor, I can disinfect it. I recommended this to my whole cohort and they have all gotten one after borrowing mine repeatedly.I do prefer the 1st edition formatting over the 2nd edition, it is just as good information-wise but I prefer the layout and size of the first."
5,Real for Teens,"As a high school teacher I am always looking for a book that will speak to the heart and soul of the teen years. This is one such book. Written in the persona of a 14 year old girl, the book has pathos, humor and hope. The characters are believable, lovable and their mistakes are understandable. The minute my students opened the book, boys and girls, they were caught. So was I! There is so much to this unusually written book, that I am only sorry I started it so near the end of the school year.It is a treasure that can remind all of us what to do when we 'get lemons.'"
4,A Complete Surprise!,"Surprisingly enough, I really disliked ""Make Lemonade"" for about the first half of the book. It was such a depressing, painful story about a girl, LaVaughn, who ends up babysitting for a 17-year-old (Jolly) who has 2 young children and no husband. LaVaughn, trying to move out of her dangerous neighborhood and into the world of college, cares for the kids in their dirty, run-down apartment while Jolly works at a factory - until she is unfairly fired. It seems as if there is no way the story could end happily... However, using a unique way of writing by breaking the text at the end of natural speaking phrases, Virginia Euwer Wolff manages to spin a tale of dispair that ends with the promise of hope.Even though I hated this book as I was reading it, the end is worth it. It's such a fufilling conclusion to a riveting story."
3,This is really a review of a reviewer,I was really tickled to read the review of The Victorians by 'a reviewer'. He thinks that A.N. Wilson is a Marxist. No doubt 'a reviewer' imagines that Donald Rumsfeld is a dangerous leftist. Anyone who buys the book expecting a Marxist interpretation is doomed to disappointment ...
2,Ho-hum,"It's telling that, at the time of writing this book, the author and his group were not initiates of the system and were more or less making it up following fairly sketchy outlines.There's some good stuff but most of it is highly duplicative of all the other pre-initiate level western magical books. If you own any of these, e.g. Kraig, you're likely to be disappointed in this, and in some places it's downright misleading, probably not deliberately but out of lack of initiatic information."
5,"Experience Alex Singer's Zionism, Compassion and Strength","If this book had been simply about an IDF soldier who made aliyah, it would have been interesting at that. However, this book is that and so much more. It is an opportunity to experience how determined a young soldier can be, how focused and centered on his beliefs a young man can be and how warm and compassionate a young Jewish son, brother and friend can be... in his own words, at the time he was making these decisions and having these experiences. It is an opportunity to experience Alex's Zionism, compassion and strength. Every letter/journal entry written by Alex moved me and I am not often moved by books and by people whom I have never met. I recommend this book as highly as I possibly can."
3,"OK, but loud","Purchased this HD to get a little more space, and it does that, but man is this thing loud. That being said, it will probably last forever, like most Seagates I've owned."
3,"Good, but loud","Seagate drives are usually high quality, and I have no reason to think that this one isn't, but it is quite noisy, and at a high frequency that really irritates me. It's so maddening that I'm considering unplugging the drive, and only reconnecting it once a month for backups."
5,Great Product,Installing this hard drive was simple and quick. Seagate has done a good job at making the transfer of information from the old hard drive to the new one. It took me about 1/2 hour for the whole process.
2,I had to skim read to finish this one,"I found this one to be stupid and boring. The author spends way too much time on what the characters are thinking.... let's get on with some action!! All this angst drives me crazy! I had told myself that I would never buy another book by Suzanne Forster, so I have no one to blame but myself. She doesn't make the characters engaging.... I never cared about them! She goes into too much detail. I prefer Susan Elizabeth Phillips, or Linda Howard, or Suzanne Brockman.... but I promise that I will not ever read another book by this author."
1,Ripping it by hand is easier.,"Now, I didn't anticipate this to be a heavy-duty paper shredder, but I expected it to perform. It's fine if you are shredding credit card offers and other items, but when I went to destroy some old files, the motor died. At most, I shredded 100 pieces of paper before this happened. I expect a little more for a shredder this pricey."
1,"Looks good, but . . .","Was initially happy with this good-looking addition to my office corner at home, but it choked on a credit card (very important to be able to shred! and the claims said one card will shred fine) and it's now dead. I'm disabled and can't use scissors, so this was supposed to be a very useful tool. Is it worth trying to get it fixed? I sure didn't get enough use out of it to justify the investment, and if I have to go through hoops to get it fixed, it's not worth my time. Wish I'd read these other reviews first. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Buy function, not form (can't seem to get both in the same package)."
2,Scissors would be easier!!,"Wanted cross-cut shredder and it does that. Slowly,very slowly. You would think it was cutting through a log. Does not pull the paper all the way through. Have to use reverse or clear every time. Don't expect that the motor will last as it strains far too much for so little paper.Haven't tried the pencil sharpener,would rather not know,I will hire a squirrel to knaw my pencils for me. ALL FORM, NO FUNCTION!"
3,Compatability problems,"Feels like a high quality cord. The problem is that the receptacle end only accepts a true 20Amp plug. I understand that the plug end of the cord is a 20Amp plug, but the receptacle end should accept both the standard 15Amp and 20Amp plugs. All my 20Amp wall outlet accept both plugs."
2,Caution: Not Compatible With Standard 110V Equipment and Outlets,The main description for this extension cord is inadequate. You have to go down to the technical description to find out this extension cord is not compatible with 110v equipment and outlets. This cord is for 220v service.
5,Delicious,"Creamy white chocolate and crunchy hazelnuts. Wonderful! I have ordered these a number of times and they are always very good. Hard to find locally, thank goodness for Amazon."
2,Don't buy discs that are made in Mexico,"I love the story, am intrigued by the cast, and find the sets wonderful. I do not have a problem with the ""salty"" language. But the DVDs are poorly made. Some will not play at all, others freeze and skip, and one is completely blank. The packaging looks great until you open it and realize the DVDs are not protected properly. By sliding them in and out of the cardboard sleeves they will likely become scratched. Because of the ""Catch 22"" return policy, (only DVDS in original shrink wrap packaging may be returned) you run the risk buying something that will not play. Amazon must know of the Quality Control problems with these DVDS that are produced in Mexico. Makes me wonder if they are bootlegged. Don't buy these DVDs from Amazon.com. Go to a local store with a better return policy."
1,price to high,HBO is out of there mind charging this much for only 36 episodes.its a great show but this is a rip off.
1,Horrible show,This show is so dark and it's filled with curse words. Horrible to watch and it moved so so so slowly. I do not enjoy watching this show in the least. If you like traditional western's do not buy this.
1,"Best series, poor quality.",I gave this as a gift to my friends who love this series. tried two different players and it skips and stalls throughout. quality issues!!
5,Great,"Everything was promised as stated, Great seller, good books , friends want me to share it with them, Its a hard to find item!"
1,"Should be titled ""Dreadfull"".","I tried very hard to like and enjoy this series. The story line and plot had a lot of potential; however, the writers were so inept in their writing they had to resort to using vulgar, nasty, and offensive language, which seemed to be every other word. The language and nudity that was used was too unbelievable and made it difficult to follow the story line. I find it unbelievable that these well known people used that language and in that era. Maybe if it was set today in the intercity of most large cities or prison. It was a disgrace to portray these beloved characters from our past as nasty, vulgar scum. It was just for shock. I am disappointed in the wonderful actors who had to lower themselves to this type of film. I am not disputing the history or the facts, but remember Hollywood is known for exaggerating and taking liberties."
1,Waste of time,"I bought this for my husband because he is a huge fan of GOOD Westerns, we could hardly sit through the first episode because it was so raunchy! The rating on this was mature so I expected it to be geared for adult viewers,but trash is trash, and that is where it went! I didn't even want to give it to anyone else. It could have been alot better without the vulgarity, why do people think that this makes a movie more realistic? I so long for the days of John Wayne & Clint Eastwood."
5,Fantastic series - must see for any Old West/American History fans,"WOW!!! I ordered this series for my wife, who is an Old West TV fan. The first episode was slow for the first 5 minutes, then I was hooked. What great acting, direction, etc., etc. No wonder Ian McShane won an Oscar for this. All of the other actors, Timothy Olyphant, Molly Parker, etc. are just great as well. The only problem with this series is that it is not long enough. My wife and I dred the end as there will be no more. This series, with it's original cast, should be brought back. A MUST SEE for any viewer who enjoys great acting."
2,Incomplete,"There is no such thing as ""The Complete Series"" in describing this product. Since HBO and the producers decided to leave this story completely hanging, the disrespect they showed this otherwise wonderful product, borders on criminal negligence."
3,Missing disc,Everything was fine until we opened the box to start watching and disc two of the second season is missing!! How frustrating!
1,Garbage Series,"This is the worst thing I have seen on dvd. It is profane.(full female and male nudity) The dialog is right out of the gutter The characters are perverse. I was conned into buying this because of the great reviews. Evidenty, the people writing the reviews are without moral character. I wouldn't even give this series away. I used all the discs as targets for my guns. We couldn't even finish the 1st disc."
1,htyl,"Deadwood was made by a group of people who could not figure out how to express themselves without using some very vulgar language, in almost every scene."
5,Deadwood,My husband loves this series. Used to watch it until it went off. Very nice packaging and easy to use.
5,"""Deadwood"" an epic worthy of Shakespeare","""Deadwood"" is a profane & profound look at the rough'n'tumble daily life of the gamblers, gold miners, whores, and con artists who all inhabit this town. Desperados & despicables abound in the gotta' ""get rich"" atmosphere of Deadwood. The pigs eat well, and the complicated machinations of the varied folk are worthy of Shakespeare. Love this series!"
5,Better Watching Than Originally Aired,This series was great when it originally aired on HBO. It's even better when you can watch several episodes in a row. The special features are interesting and provide insights that add to the viewing experience. It's a shame that HBO cancelled the series and didn't make the finale they said they would.
5,"Spectacular,Spectacular!","Recorded during their ""Someone Get Me A Ladder"" of 1973-74,""Welcome Back My Friends..."" showcases this prog-rock trio at the height of their powers.Like The other Shout! Factory ELP remasters-Emerson, Lake & Palmer,Tarkus,Pictures at an ExhibitionandTrilogy-this classic triple-LP set has finally gotten the sonic treament that ELP deserved but never had from previous 80's-90's masters.Remastered by Andy Pearce at Masterpiece London(just like others mentioned above),this mammoth album now has been fully allowed the full sonic impact of live ELP to be heard.Despite the lack of bonus tracks,fans of ELP and prog-rock shouldn't hesitate to pick up this reasonably-priced-at-2-discs remastered jewel."
1,The ELP Gold Vein Is Mined Out...,"Don't get me wrong. I have Shout Factory's release of the eponymous first album, which I dearly love. Trilogy has it's momemnts, and Works is...well, that's another review. But this album, though nicely recorded, reflects the band as stage-stricken with their own hype, and one cannot help but be saddened that the band's edgy creativity became muted when the phony rhinestone glitz got in the way of the expression of true musical genius. The title itself was enough to turn me off, and rather than wait for still more self-indulgent hype, I turned to Bartok and Zappa. But enough said. If you like this album, don't miss out on the Kiss and Andy Gibb albums."
1,this book was truly exasperating.,"i'd give it a -5 if i could!11the characters are so typical and the plot is a chichei don't exactly remember where the too-sweet hero fell in love with the helpless heroine. the book was all about sex and i can't appreciate that. if you wanna read a REAL damsel in distress plot, read a knight in shining armor by jude deveraux. it was wonderful."
2,"A good read, but we are talking E. Lowell here!","The plot is excellent, the main character must overcome several fears that would leave most women in therapy for the rest of their life. The setting (Great Barrier reef Ausie land) is also depicted in the most gorgeous detail. So why didnt I like this book more? Because Lowell can do so much better. Dialogue is perhaps the worst she has ever written. The romance is contrived (real death knell) This is a somewhat sad ""could have been a contender"""
5,Like studying; but fun!,"I just bought this book 2 days ago and I already love it. I have been going through it and I find it has the answers to all of the questions any HP fan would want. It has questions like 'Did Alchemists really search for a magic stone?' or 'Which Fantastic Beasts come from legend?' or 'Where do those names come from?!' It is really like a Harry Potter encyclopedia, but not like all encyclopedias; this is actually fun! It also makes you appreciate J.K.Rowling as you realize how much effort she puts into her books. All said and done, this is the best ""textbook"" I have ever seen!"
2,Confused,I really enjoy Guy Ritchie movies but found this one so confusing that I still haven't figured out the plot. My suggestion wait until it comes on cable.
5,Jason and Guy RULES!,Why rating of 5 stars?Because this is Master GUY Peace with all of the best from Jason (with hair) Statham and unforgiven Ray Liotta in all of their madness that you can enjoy in every minute of the movie.Sound and picture in fusion of the moment (no Oscar Included).Did ever Luc Besson choose wrong?
2,Painful to Watch....,"This movie was way too artsy for me.... Or at least it tried to put a new twist to the typical crime/drama theme dealing with the whole casino and confidence antics so popular today in many Hollywood movies.The cinematography was awesome and so were the special effects. The acting was decent, BUT the storyline was worse for the wear overall. I had the storyline figured out early on as the ending is predictable."
1,Not happy,"The center piece of the dvd case was broken allowing the dvd to bounce around during the shipping process. The dvd was scratched badly and wont play on dvd players, luckily it works in my computer. Secondly I bought three dvd's through this seller at once hoping to save money on shipping, i was still charged three separate shipping fees but the dvd's were all sent in the same package."
3,Revolver,"Good movie, lots of plot twist and you really have to pay attention to everything. I enjoyed it."
3,Not bad ...but..,"Jason Stathem is not know for being in great movies, so this is one of the few that he is in that bares repeat viewing. The screenplay tries to be original failing sometimes...but mostly passing. Ray Liotta, and Endre Benjamin are fun and engaging....again...not an award winner but worth a watch."
2,Definitely not high art movie,"I typically like Guy Richie's film with hazy characters who are not tortured by morality but rather by different ways to make money, beat the scam and be on top of the sleazy game. They talk with working class british accent and are streetwise to a point of gaining credibility of being able to survive in this doggy dog world without any education but their innate will to live.I was hoping that revolver is going to be another movie about the underdog beating the gang of brothers but half way through it I could not wait for it to end. This is not ""Machinist"" or a ""Fight Club"" or any other number of the movies that we have already seen that address split personality or alter ego or some other kind of altered reality. It is failed attempt to create high art.Well, hopefully Richie got it out of his system and the next one will be back to what he does best. Street smart guy beating the odds is his best way to make a really good movie or at its best, good entertainment."
2,Barely entertaining,"The actors and scenes are interesting enough on the surface, but ultimately the film fails to deliver its spiritual message with any hint of clarity. The viewer must work hard to stay engaged for at best a partial and mere intellectual reward of doubtful utility. The filmmaker's message is delivered in such a muddled manner that the the visceral, experiential moment of understanding required for it to be valuable is withheld from the viewer.If you want to kill some time, and enjoy the visuals, some scenes and takes on their own, and familiar actors, go ahead. But don't bother trying to stay engaged in the storyline. The huge effort required yields paltry reward."
3,"Self-serving, but a good story","I enjoyed the story, although some things really bothered me. As another stated, Adele is SO perfect, or seems to be if you ignore her extreme rudeness and just plain nastiness to her nosey, but elderly neighbor. Guess you have to be a patient to see her wonderful, caring nature. Also, her frequent ""Christ on a bike"" expression is unnecessary and offended me."
3,Like the series - this one's okay,"I really enjoy the Adele books and I find the perspective of Nelson a lot of fun. However, as a nurse, I can tell you that we can't afford to get as involved with our patients as Adele does. She really steps over the line at times (as you will see when you read this book.) And by the way, never feed a dog onions. They can cause gastrointestinal bleeding in dogs which is why I'm glad that Nelson had fictional onion pancakes."
2,Great premise ~ Too much technical jargon!,"This book started off with a bang, but there were too many red herrings and far too much technical jargon and explicit descriptions of research processes. The characters seemed one-dimensional and I was disappointed in the development of the exposure of the ""nut case"" in this story. Great premise, flimsy, fragmented development."
1,Boring,"I have read quite a few Robin Cook books and have enjoyed most of them, but not this one. I gave up on it after about 120 pages. I just could not get into this one. The story bored me and so did the characters."
3,much smaller then described,"we have the winterberry pattern and entertain a lot over the holidays. Saw this casserole and it is listed as a 9X13 inch which is standard, but in fact it is only 7.5X12. It is still a nice casserole but just smaller so may need two."
2,False advertising,This is advertised as a 9-inch-by-13-inch but is in actual fact 8X11 so was very disappointed as I specifically needed a 9x13
5,awesome music!,this cd is the best! great message with a great voice and tune! family friendly lyrics that teach about gods love makes it a winner! very happy with the purchase and will for sure be looking into his other albums!
2,Kase should have spent more time backtesting her results + validating them statistically,"Quite a disappointment. I red this book because of Kase her background in mathematics and because she was trader herself. This book has some good ideas but the material on her indicators is very limited + I didn't see any promising backtests (just some charts). On top of that the explanations on the indicators are not clear at all (like a typical advertisement folder for a black box system).Also her idea on the deviation stop was not that clear or elaborated at all. It sounds like a good idea, sure, but that's also where it stops. All in all I found this book very overrated, certainly for someone with a scientific background. If you then consider the price this book is being sold at ..."
2,Make Up Your Mind!,Sensitive guys help their buddy get hitched. Light on plot and lots of whining.I think they all really want to hug the gay guy.
5,More than just the story.,"Lorna Doone is a classic tale of romance and bravery, vengance and villany. What is important about the book besides the story is the societal subtext. When you read this book you get a picture of what made the British Empire great. We see Master Jan, or John Ridd, a simple squire, who catches his own fish, harvests his own wheat at the head of his labourers. This humble man is not afraid to take matters all the way up to his king and expect justice in return. We see a comedy of errors as militia groups vie with each other and end up fighting each other instead of the enemy. The whole tale is told amid the last battles ever fought on English soil during the little known Monmouth rebellion. A remarkable and noteworthy book, which tells more than the main story. It is both a great read and a portrait of English rural society of the time."
5,a classic classic!,"I have no idea how I ever missed this book before. Not only had I never read it, I can't honestly remember ever hearing about anyone else reading it either. The writing is luxurious; the story is compelling and the characters are full and richly drawn. Please read this book and recommend it to your friends; let's not let it fall into the has-been classics category!"
2,Just so-so,"I bought this mill to use to make baby food, and having used ir I wouldn't recommend for such use. It only comes with one blade and it's a bit too corse for that. Other than that it's ok. I might have spent a little more for a better quality unit. But for infrequent use this is not to bad."
4,Rubbermaid customer service is lacking,"I purchased this basket in the titanium style a little bit ago on clearance at a store. I installed the closet system for my coat closet. I loved the product and decided to install the same system in my closets upstairs. I saved this basket for the upstairs. Fast forward to just a couple of weeks ago when I finally buy and install upstairs and go to install my basket. It was broken. Silly husband has already cut up boxes and I knew the store I got it didn't have any more anyway. I went back and forth online with Rubbermaid customer service and I was disappointed in the outcome. Instead of offering to replace the product (which was clearly defective,) they sent me a coupon good for $20 off any Rubbermaid product. Clearly I cannot get a new basket for that and would rather have had the basket replaced."
3,Reckless abandon,Good plot and excellent banter but uninhibited sex probably intended to represent reckless abandon detracts from the light hearted banter and reckless abandon with which the plot itself unwinds.
3,My first experience reading a Stone Barrington novel,"In browsing through the bookstore, the title of this book intrigued me and I thought I would take a chance. The book wasn't terrible. It had some fairly exciting parts in it. But it wasn't a ""read-throughout-the-night"" thriller either.The story line at times seemed a little forced and there were two spots in particular that you could see the author added to the plot because they were going to come up again later on in the story.I wouldn't recommend this book if it was the only thing you could bring to a deserted island but if you're looking for an easy read that doesn't require a lot of thinking, then this is a good book to pick up."
1,Reminds me of a Movie Chapter Plays from the 1940's!,"This book takes Stone and Holly into non-believable situtations. You sometimes feel Clark Kent and Lois Lane are the main characters as in a Superman comic book. Mr. Woods is simply cashing in on an awful piece of work. The book is so bad compare to his earlier ""Chiefs"" book that you would think it was written by two different authors. Mr. Woods in recent years has clearly sacrificed quality for quantity. Not only do I not recommend this book but suggest you remove Stuart Woods from your must buy author list. He has crossed the line from, ""literature to put my name on it and they will buy it."""
2,Worst of the Stone Barrington series,"This is the lastest in the Stone Barrington series and the weakest entry from Woods. There is very little plot in this story; mostly talking heads. Credit Holly Barker for taking about three days to seduce Stone, though. Usually the females in the Barrington mysteries jump into bed with Stone in under 24 hours, which is another part of this series that I have never understood. The stories should be strong enough to not have to resort to the unbelievable sexcapades of Mr. Barrington, where women are all to eager to jump in the sack with him and are never sexually satisfied, leaving the poor sexually starved women trying to arouse Stone for yet another round."
2,Ecumenism and poorly-thought-out pledges: not so good for kids.,"My daughter's class is using this book, and she came home yesterday with a Milestones-written pledge the teacher wanted us both to sign. I wrote back. Summary: Please do not direct children to sign pledges; also, the Milestones people have serious problems in their thinking. They're asking children to promise to do an impossible thing, also misleading them seriously about the power of respectful language. I'd revise the curriculum heavily and introduce as ethics to take on privately, rather than seeking a pledge campaign. Milestones is well-meant, but the quality of the thought is not good."
3,Good in theory,"Right off I want to say, this is a safe seat, and we'll continue to use them, but... This is a fantastic idea in theory, but in reality, it didn't work for our family (we have two of them). We wanted to buy one car seat and have it last clear till the end. They work well as a rear facing seat, but not as sturdy as I would have liked. The do work well as a forward facing, while still using the harness. We are currently using one as a belt positioning booster and it seems a little tippy. I went to use one of the backless boosters the other day and realized just how huge it is and in the process, found out that for the safest ride, you should keep your child in the high back booster till they are done. So if I had it to do all over again, I would buy one seat for infancy, one for rear/forward facing with harness, and another high back booster, all seperate."
3,"OK, but should have been better","All the information in this book is awesome. It's jam-packed with tons of good, solid Bible teaching on discipleship, stuff that really will change your life if you apply it.And that's my main beef with the book. It's got too much information in it. It's packed solid with stuff. I tried using it in a small group, and each chapter was like reading a whole book. There's no way you can retain it all if you plan on doing a chapter a week.So, on the one hand, I want to give this book 5 stars for being so jam-packed with good teaching. But, on the other hand, it's system overload every time you sit down to read it, rendering it almost useless.Great book, but I wish it would have been made into a series instead, with each topic fleshed out a little more and drawn out over a few chapters instead of crammed into one chapter."
5,Impressions on Garden Retreats,"I found Barbara Ashmun's new book 'Garden Retreats' a truly inspiring read. By intimately relating her impressions of youth and how her own style developed, the author encourages readers to look within themselves for clues to what their own unique garden retreat might be. Barbara's book guides the reader in the process of creating a truly individual space. Written in gentle poetic prose, the book transports the reader within the retreats she so well describes. Garden Retreats abounds with practical ideas for creating retreats, from creating a private place, to setting the mood with colors and textures, structures and a lot more. The book glows with stunning photographs by Allan Mandell which makes it so inspiring to copy the ideas pictured. I highly recommend this book to novice as well as experienced gardeners."
1,2 sword wall display rack,"The rack arrived in a timely manner, but I was completely dissatisified with it. There were no directions for assembly, and in trying to assemble it, I found that pre-drilled holes for screws were no alligned properly. Needing to drill several new holes was inconvenient.On eventual assembly,the screws split the composition board used for the rack, and the assembled rack was uneven/warped, needing adhesive to affix it to the wall to hold the swords.The seller offered to replace it, but only after I returned it......not right away.....and it wasn't worth the trouble. They said it was a manufacturers mistake, and I think they should have offered to send me another right away, returning the defective product after I got the replacement.I'll not do business with them again.Bob Lindholm"
4,Fast & Good Service,The order was as good as it's picture. Received ring very quick and ring was in good shape.
5,Who's Counting,"Who's counting is an excellent book, and a must read. Although it would be easier to understand the finite details of the accounting methods with a financial background, this book provides something even more important; an understanding of the interrelationships between people and departments within a lean organization.Jerrold M. Solomon clearly brings to light the difficulties in crossing organizational silos and the challenge of bringing different areas of a company together for a common goal. Regardless of your financial knowledge, the understanding gained about interpersonal relationships through reading this book will be well worth your time."
2,I hope you have really low standards,"This movie has a couple of mediocre fight scenes but sadly most of this movie has to do with (I am not makeing this up) the charicters political life as running for office. The fight scences have little to do with the plot, not that there are very many. Now there are a lot of B movies worse than this that cost a lot more but this just doesn't offer much. I reccomend Daniel Bernhardt, Gary Daniels and Billy Blanks. Their movies usually have more action and quality"

4,A good gift for the statistically curious,"I give my dad an almanac almost every year, switching between the NYT and World Almanac. He likes them."
4,very good book,"Not the last picture show book, but a good and worthy sequel. I enjoyed the interplay between the women and Duane. I can't wait to read the other books in the sequence. Thanks Larry, I wish I had read this book 23 years ago."
1,Zip it up.,"Bad acting,a lead actress thats more concerned about how she smiles and to top it all,some guy in a sweat suit trying to be scarey with a machete.As the above commented so well i feel a little drained as to how further to slate this.So what can you say,yes it started more like a abad porno,hence why i started to watch,but it got no better.If you like pantyhose videos or your into legs and stuff,check this out ,plenty of fluff on show,all be it in the 80's/90's era.Anyhow as a general review.....pants."
3,Balls are nice!,"Thought buying high end balls would be a big improvement. The play a little better than the standard balls supplied, but they getting marked up from regular play and the marks don't clean off. Would not buy these again."
5,Genesis Platinun collection,Perfect collection of the hits. No matter if you are an old fan or a new one you will love this collection of songs. I bought this to get me ready for the long awaited concert.
5,A true Genisis fan,this compelation is the very best that genisis has ever put out. it encompasses the history of Genisis going way back before then there were 3.
1,ONLY TWO TRACKS FROM ABACAB!?!?!?,"And it's missing the other two Top 40 hits from that album! I have waited years for a thorough Genesis compilation & it seems that I'll have to keep waiting. I can't believe they didn't include all the hits on this 3-disc set. There's absolutely no excuse for that. Besides, many of these songs are remixes. Why didn't they include the original album or single versions? I did buy the companion DVD to this collection & that has all the videos Genesis ever made. So why doesn't ""Platinum Collection"" include every charting single they ever made?"
4,Excellent!!!,"If you want to pass the Networking Essentials exam then this is the book to get!!! Easily worded allowing the reader to have a clear and precise understanding of network topologies, cabling and protocols and other important areas as well. Added with the Networking Essentials exam notes and you are bound to pass the exam."
3,"Pretty good, but you'll need more info to pass","Read this book and studied the exam questions provided by the cd. I also bought the MS Readiness Review book w/cd. The Readiness Review book's questions resembled the actual questions on the test. This book is a good study tool although the sample tests don't accurately mirror the questions on the test. I'll use this conbination for my other tests until I find that they aren't adequate. It would be nice if they gave some answers to their ""real world"" problems."
2,Ever heard of proofreaders?!,"Dang, doesn't anybody *proofread* the books in this series put out by Sybex and approved by Microsoft?! The book is *littered* with errors both in the body of the text and the sample tests at the end of each chapter! I also found that to be the case with the TCP/IP study book in this same series. Gotta love it when their answers to the test questions contradict what appears in the body of a chapter! Makes me wonder if the people that wrote the tests even bothered to read the chapters! The individual who scrawled his (or her) name on the back of the book as being ""Technically reviewed and approved by"" should be ashamed. Or, maybe it's an illegible scribble for a reason. Hire some proofreaders, Sybex/Microsoft!"
5,Added Relevance in a post-Sept. 11th World,"Taken by itself, this book is a masterpiece of sophisticated humor *and* political relevance masked as a ""Super Friends""-like cartoon book knock off. There are obscure references to famous utterances associated with each of the ex-Presidents that I hadn't thought of in 25 years or more. To see Jimmy Carter taking on a villian with the line ""I have lust in my heart...to kick your ass."" Man, that's funny stuff.But now, after the terrorist attacks on NYC and the Pentagon, there it is right on Page 1 of the New York Times: ""Bush Appeals to Ex-Presidents for Coalition-Building Efforts."" Life imitates art to a 'T'. Absolutely amazing."
5,Great!,"I have looked for this on CD for years. I had the original on 8 track when it was originally released. This CD is expensive but the re-mix and audio are awesome. If you loved Woodstock, you will love this CD."
2,Not that great,"I'm going to write the same review for all three of the ASE Test Prep guides I purchased.To be honest, I'm not very impressed. I'm used to the study guides for the FAA flight tests which are generally excellent from everyone. These had typos in the questions. One question even said to refer to a diagram which they forgot to print! I also found several mistakes in their subject matter in the study section.I think they are an aid and do help with the preparation but they publisher could have done a much better job especially for the price."
2,"Don't, Britney","I seriously thought this was the only listenable song on the OOPS!... CD but no, Britney had to ruin it with that stripper-like videoclip. I mean, it's not like she doesn't have enough money to afford to get herself some decent clothing. I suppose she never heard the saying ""Less isn't always more"".Nevertheless, the orginal version of the song is just fine. Deep, meaningful and not typically Britney. It just proves that Mutt Lange had done a great job once again and the acknowledgements should go out to Mutt instead of Britney. After, Mutt is the master mind behind this brilliant single.I at first thought that I was going to get this single but the video totalyl changed my mind therefore the two stars aboce goes to Mutt and not Britney."
3,A fine artist finally gets his due.,"Joel Smith, Saul Steinberg: Illuminations (Yale, 2006)Among those artists in the stable of The New Yorker, Saul Steinberg may be second only in recognition to Charles Addams. And yet, until 2006, there had never been a major retrospective of Steinberg's work. This book is the companion volume to the exhibition that rectified that oversight, and it is chock-full of drawings and photographs of both Steinberg and his work, along with a ninety-six page biographical essay by Smith. Even if you don't know Steinberg's name, if you saw issues of The New Yorker at any time during the over three decades Steinberg was working for them, you probably know his work. And if you've been a fan all that time, you may still be surprised at how much farther-ranging his work went beyond that. Either way, it's worth checking out. ***"
5,DeWALT Hammerdrill DC925KA,"This is an excellent tool. It is well made, has plenty of power and was well thought out by DeWALT. It makes fast and enjoyable work out of long and big jobs. It is well worth the money."
2,Little improvement since Act 2000,"Act 6.0 incorporates a number of changes to make it more like Outlook, but nothing for users interested in real customer relationship functionality. There is no way to track competitors, no way to modify the screen for opportunities, no ability to track accounts (group is a klutzy workaround). In short those users who hoped that a little of the Saleslogix capability wwould trickle down into this new version of Act will be sorely disappointed. I learned from a dealer that Microsoft's new product will offer all these features, but it isn't due out until later this year. I'm eager to make a switch then!"
1,What a letdown!!,"I've used act for over 10 years, and am so disappointed that I am looking for another contact manager...probably goldmine. The upgrade really didn't offer many additional benefits but caused many problems with report templates. Tech support only wants to charge you for a problem created by them to begin with. It is a shame to see what was a good program being fumbled by a company such as Interact. This upgrade seems to be about them generating fees for tech support calls. Save your money on the upgrade!"
1,Mail merge changes,"I work in public relations, and have been using ACT 2000 very successfully for a while to send out mail merge press releases. The new mail merge features in ACT 6.0 only allow graphical email documents to be sent out using a merge. A very large file (the last one page press release with nothing but text I sent was 6.37 MB) is attached to the document. Many newspapers I send information to are not even allowed to open mail that has attachments, and many will not accept mail that large. So the new version is useless to me. If there is a way around it, I can't find it, and of course ACT's support is legendarily non-existent. There is no free technical support at all, and their so-called knowledge base fails me most of the time."
3,It does the job and looks cute,"Well i bought this product for my dungarian hamster, she isnt a draft for isnt full size, which is a good thing because this is tiny she fits in it perfectly. it has cute colors but the little lader that came with it doesnt stay on and it was terrible to put together it took me an hour to fit the peices, on top of that its impossible to clean the bottom part because you cant take it apart. but my little hamster loves it and tho the plastic is cheap it has yea to be broken but it helps that she isnt a chewer."
3,Not so bad,"I'm a ""proudly"" owner of C4 for 8 months.They are good looking,very comfortable for walking.I have played in them couple of times,and i m not satisfied. Bad ankle support,VERY BAD cushioning,and bad stability.THAT SHOE IS ALL ABOUT LOOK!"
2,Film Shows Its Age,"This film shows its age in both a positive and negative way. Produced during the 70's, i.e. at the height of the Soviet occupation, it treads lightly while dealing with Poland's war-torn history. At one point a lead character explains that he is willing to accept Swedish rule temporarily in order to use their assistance against Poland's other ""enemies."" Since these enemies - Russians and Ukrainians - made up the bulk of the Soviet occupation forces, it is hardly surprising that they are not named. The acting in the film is overwrought, especially in the beginning. Making matters worse, the lead, Daniel Olbrychinski, is made-up like a silent film star. In an effort to impress the audience with the size of the Swedish army invading the country, the Director marches the same 40 or 50 extras past the camera about 10 times. (...) That said, this film is worth seeing (if not owning) if you're interested in Eastern European History circa the seventeenth century. (...)"
3,Whimsical and Fragile,"I purchased these glasses as a gift. The designs are fun, and have a young feel to them. I was very disappointed when I received the package and there was one glass broken already. I returned them without any problem.When I repurchased them again I had additional problems with easy breakage. While Mikasa has normally a great line and usually there are not any issues, I was very disappointed and will not purchase this line again due to their fragile nature. I know that any glass should be handled in a delicate matter, however, I do not think the craftsmanship was up to par on this particular product."
5,Huge!!!,"If you are looking for large wine glasses, you're gonna want these wine glasses. They consume a good part of the chatting during the wine ""drinking."""
1,"Junk glasses, pretty to look at, break far too easily","I bought 12 glasses each of most of this set of Mikasa a couple years ago when it was on sale from Macy's thru Amazon. Forget washing in the dishwasher, you so much as look the wrong way at these and they break. The wine ballons are especially fragile, I have just a couple left. This with once a month use. They are not durable enough to be everyday use and not nice enough to justify taking up storage space as special occasion glasses. I am VERY disappointed in Mikasa, I would never buy from them again."
4,Mikasa Goblets,"Love the goblets. 4 stars only cause 1 was broken when I got it. I will replace it but ovrrall, I absolutely love them."
4,Great addition!,"The shoe shelves are a great addition to the basic shelving kit. Just make sure you understand how the ""A"" and ""B"" shelves work together..."
5,xmas gift,I got this for my sister in law and she was quite happy to receive to it. It arrived very quickly and in good shape
1,Scary?!,"I bought this CD because I wanted the sound of rain hitting a patio. However, the sound is inconsistent. It starts pretty loudly but about 20 minutes later, both the rain and especially the thunder die off. Also, the sound isn't smooth. It sounds like several separate storms patched together without any transition.My main problems, though, are the non-storm noises. I knew from the sampler of this series that there is a little dog barking in the background, but I thought it was quiet enough to ignore. The barking is present, no surprise. What I can't accept is a faint, disjointed SINGING like a ghost trapped in an insane asylum. Listen closely, and you will hear this phenomenon around 5:50, 6:10, and 9:00. I kept telling myself I was imagining things. Then I leaned over the player and there it was right in my ear: this short passage of yelling like some demon-possessed maniac out in the storm. I was freaked out. Do not buy this piece of junk!"
4,Pretty Good Ice Melter,"Decided to get this torch after we had almost an inch of rain on Christmas on top of 8' of snow then plunging temperatures that created very thick ice on sidewalk and driveway apron between sidewalk and street gutter. The first time I used it the temperature was about 22 degrees and it took a long time to melt a small area of 1"" thick ice in front of rural mailbox. The water has to have some placed to go and will re-freeze at that temperature. When used on a sunny day with temperature of 29 degrees it worked a lot better. You won't be able to just wave the wand back and forth and melt ice, but if you hold the flame on the edge of the ice and use an ice chopper the torch does make ice removal easier. I think the torch is very well made. It's mostly metal construction with a very sturdy valve assembly which makes it easy to control the flame. It lights very easily. Recommend the Bare Blaster as an unique winter weather tool."
5,One of Ray's Best,"I have many of Ray Price's CDs, albums, etc. This one really gets my attention because Ray worked so hard at trying to improve his songs often. In this one I got to listen to him using all the ranges of his voice. This should be in the top five of his CDs in my opinion."
4,Olympus VN-900,This is the voice recorder I've been looking for. It givesyou 22 minutes of high quality recording in HQ mode. Youcan select the microphone sensitivity for dictation orhigh. I keep mine on high all the time. It will pick upbird songs or planes flying overhead. There is a holdswitch on the side of the unit that disables the buttonsso that it won't activate when you are carrying it inyour pocket or purse. The pocket clip is pretty muchuseless; you need to carry it in your jeans pocket orpurse in order not to lose it.
1,poorly,The product was not what I expected and was in very bad condition after I opened the package hadd sevearl hole in the seems where it was not sewn properly I will never buy again fron this company...
1,bad,"this product looks great in the pic. just didn't like the way it looked on the bed. did not like the quality. would not have ever bought it if I realized it had to be dry cleaned. It cost me as much money to ship it back as what I paid for it so, I threw that money away"
5,Absolutely LOVE it!,I really love this comforter set. It is super comfortable and luxury sleeping. Great value at 39.99
3,ok for $40-not if full price,to me this is an ok bargain at $40 but by no means would I have paid $200-its more walmart than highend-I do like the color(moss) and its easy to make match to other stuff.
4,Very comfortable and soft,"This comforter and set are very comfortable and look good. My only concern is with washing, which has not yet come up. I am happy with them so far."
4,uber comfortable,"this comforter is sooo comfortable, only problem i have with it is that you cannot put it in your washer to clean it."
4,Great Value,"I read other reviews of this product and it appeared that it wasn't a well-received product, however, I am pretty pleased with my purchase. The color and print are nice (for either male or female) and the quality very good, especially considering the price paid. I would recommend it!"
2,limited luxury,The comforter did not feel like true microsuede. It is okay for a sparecotton comforter.
2,Poor Quality,"Luxury Paisley Microsuede Queen Comforter 4-Piece Bedding Set, CaféThis is a VERY poor quality set, that I would've freaked if I had paid the original $139.00, not the $29.00 I actualy paid. This is a disposable set. Sides weren't sew completely. I washed it in gentle and cold water like someone else suggested and wound up with a huge lump of stuffing in the middle. Thanks to Amazon, they helped me with the matter!!!"
3,"Come on, $140","I bought this product for $40 a few months ago. Realizing that it was too synthetic feeling for my bed, I followed the lead of another buyer and sought to get one for my dog.Again, it was $40 then, and many elements (bed skirt, overly warm pillow covers) I had no use for. Still, the main comforter is attractive and comfortable.So, I'm a bit surprised to see that the price has tripled. Truly, the quality is not all that great. For my dog (who I'll even admit is spoiled!), yes. But for people, no."
5,Great Comforter!,This was a great comforter. Well worth the money I spent for it. It was even better than I expected it to be!
3,"Paisley design looks nice, quality just ok for price.","After receiving this set I think that it's just an ok deal for $40. It's a 100% polyester set (Made in China). I'd bought another Micro suede set from BB&B with their ubiquitous coupon at exactly the same price, and this set is just about the same quality, so it's definitely not a once in a lifetime deal. The brown paisley is nice, and works equally well for men or women if you use it in a guest bedroom. I did not like the lining on the underside of the comforter too much as it seems under 300 thread count. The comforter itself is quite thin. However, it will be just ok for the summer. To get a more luxurious look for the guest bed I'm supplementing this set with some nicer 450+ thread count matching sheets."
1,Just ample!,"I ordered two of these microsuede comforters; one in green and the other in brown. I was disappopinted in both. The comforter is not plump enough to add richness to the style. Tufting can barely be seen. I ordered queen sizes, but they seemed more like full. Maybe if I had ordered the king size I would have been more satisfied."
2,Good for the price,"Good for the price, but you will need to buy a cover for the comforter. The material is really not comfortable."
5,Thank you,"As with most Jimmy Buffett music, there is a personal story that comes to mind when you hear each song. Thank you for bringing back the music and the memories for me..."
5,an early classic,"Love JB's Montana-influenced music. As I was growing up in the '70s, this was a favorite in our family. We later found out that just after World War I, two great-uncles ran the bank in Ringling, Montana. That made the song all the more interesting. (And we, too, are from a ""dyin' little town."")"
1,An appallingly bad book. . .,"If you love history and historical fiction, if you've been fascinated by Anne Bolyn or Henry VIII, if you love big, juicy period tales----please avoid this book at all costs! I, like many of the reviewers here,have long gobbled up everything I could about Anne, and even played her in Maxwell Anderson's wonderful drama, ""Anne of the Thousand Days,"" and this was a bloody awful attempt at a retelling of her story. I felt nothing for any of the characters---(how on earth can Henry and Anne be boring for heaven's sake!), got confused by the muddying of the sequence of events, and loathed her unaccountable use of modern slang which ruined any hope of getting a real sense of the era---she actually referred to Thomas Bolyn as ""dad"" in the book! I only finished it--scimmed it--out of a horrified disbelief that anything so unredeemingly bad could get published."
2,Not even particularly interesting...,"To think I actually was looking forward to this book! It really is rather horrible. The language is too modern and just makes Anne Boleyn sound like some kind of mallrat...it's a shame that such an interesting historical character is treated in such a shabby manner.If you really want a good read about Anne Boleyn, try Phillipa Gregory's ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" a historically accurate and interesting account that rings true."
1,a silly waste of time,"I could not even go past page 100 - I never quit a book. But, the vernacular described by other reviews is accurate - stupid, out of place and never allows you to feel part of the time. I am fascinated by Anne Boleyn and the other wives but I had to put this book down as a waste of time. The newspaper will probably prove more interesting."
3,Lacking...,"While I love the topic, The Queen of Subtleties just lacked... well, subtlety. Dunn had a wealth of material to work with and yet she managed to make this book seem unrelated to the real historical figures. It lacked depth in Anne Boleyn's entries - and while Lucy Cornwallis' chapters were quite interesting and seemed more sincere this came from a character who, except for her existence, is entirely fictional. One would have wished that she brought the same sense of realism to Anne and made her more human, more believable, but instead she was portrayed more 2-dimensionally.The book was readable, but the lack of continuity (the great leaps back and forth in time periods) was frustrating. The modern language was jarring. I saw Dunn's point in trying to let us more easily understand the language by putting it in modern terms, but much was lost in the modernization. You lost the feel of the era.As a book unrelated to Anne Boleyn, this book wasn't half bad. In context, it was disappointing."
5,Today Is Your Day,"Today Is Your Day... to buy this album! Better than the last one and JESSE's vox are the BOMB. Their shows are amazing and these guys used to go to my College (Berklee) so they are very inspiring to me. They rocked Boston this month and they will rock your city, too."
1,Oh my gosh this is a joke,This is the WORST instructional dvd ever created. This girl really just wanted people to sit and watch her dancing. It was retarded. So I'm returning it!
3,So-So,"The video is a bit tedious and poorly made. The instructor's tips are pretty good, but she is not the most interesting teacher; she is a little boring. She is really pretty and her dancing is ok, but I wouldn't really recommend this video."
4,Very Good,"I only gave it four stars because the speed is a little slow, but for the money it's not bad. Don't get more than one if you plan on using it over and over. what would be the point?"
3,Require text for class,"It was easy enough to read, but not something I'd pick. I had to have it for a web class."
4,Covers all the basics from a Christian perspective,"In ""The Stewardship Model"" author Michael Fluker takes a close look at three types of stewardship - time, personal and financial. For each of these types he breaks down the analysis to four types of stewards loosely based on the biblical parable of the wise steward. The four categories of stewards in his book are the Good Steward, the Efficient Steward, the Effective Steward, and the Lazy Steward. With this framework in mind he develops the ""Stewardship Model"", a basic non-technical model that anyone can follow to improve their personal management of time and finances. The bulk of the book is dedicated to money, debt, savings, and investments. In this section you will find no complex money theories or advanced economics, just simple straightforward basic financial advice. This is the kind of stuff that everyone should have been taught in school, but with a decidedly Christian slant. ""The Stewardship Model"" is a recommended read."
2,Not the best...,"While I really really like Yu-Gi-Oh (I'm a girl too!), this season really doesn't interest me. The duels get annoying, especially after seeing the same episodes EVERY SINGLE DAY on WB. I tend to like the American Dub better than the Japanese version, but when comined with the crappy animation, it's a real turn-off.Mai's new voice actress is the worst match ever...it's so obvious that it's a different person (If they thought the little children wouldn't notice, they totally thought wrong). And if you get annoyed with Weevil's and Rex's voiceovers, you'll hate them even more because they just won't go away!I totally lost interest in the storyline after a while, and I think that realeasing this season on DVD is the dumbest decision Funimation ever made. I agree with other reviews that say Funimation should have released the KC Grand Prix first, since it's SO much better than Waking the Dragons...My suggestion is to save yourself from total boredom and not buy this DVD..."
3,Its ok,"I GUESS ITS OK. IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DISAGREE WITH THE ""WHY PUT THIS ON DVD REVIEW, I THINK ITS WORTH IT."
2,Nostalgia 3-pc Bottle Set,I ordered this set to accompany. the Rretro Hot Dog Steam Roller. was very disappointed the cute holder is just thin cardboard that will need to be tossed in the trash as soon as any of the condiments splatter on it. I assumed it was plastuc or metal that could be wiped off. BIG disappointment.
1,The Heroes Of Telemark,This great movie is spoiled by this terrible disk.The quality of the video and audio is the worst I have ever viewed!
1,The Heros of Telemark,"The Cd that was sent to me by Rarewaves was not set up to run on my CD Player. When loaded it gives the message ""Wrong Region"" with no explanation on how to get to the right region. It is unplayable."
4,Historically inaccurate but entertaining,"A decent action-adventure based very loosely on the sabotage of the Nazi heavy water program by Norwegian resistance. It is a little-known and therefore underappreciated corner of the war and so, for that reason, it is good we have this movie to remind us. It is only unfortunate that hollywood thinks too often it can improve on the drama of real life. It is generally better to tell the story closer to the truth than to try and improve it. Still, despite that disappointment, it is an entertaining film with an exciting story to keep you interested to the end. But you will want to read one of the several books available to get the real excitement of this story."
5,You should read this !,"This is one of the most interesting and breathstopping books I ever read . I like to read medical literature , its fun and educational . This book is about emerging viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), like Ebola, Lassa, etc. And it is told from thetwo reaserchers who conducted all kinds of experiments in Africa and CDC to reveal the secrets of these bloody fevers . If you like this type of books , READ IT , you won't regret it . I know I won't ."
2,meth mic is way to low !! very sad,"red & meth are the best, that's why they call them the doppest rappers, as well cause they smoke a lot. any live shows from them are amazing. but on that dvd, the mic of meth is really low, and we can't heard much when he spit. that's very dissapointed. otherwise terrific show like usually by them. the show is old, so the video quality is average but still better then the sound due the fact of the low sound from meth. watch the hd dvd of meth at the sunset unstead. or buy that one for redman perfo."
2,There are better out there,Bought this when I was in a pinch and needed to find the tool quickly for a project - it does not seem to hold the measurement as accurately as I had hoped for. There are better ones out there but you get what you pay for.
2,"Ok, if you are lucky","This is my second scanner from Microtek, same model. First one was poorly packed and damaged. So it was replaced. I have used this one for 2 months before it died. Scanning mechanism jams on start-up. Now it is sitting dead. I used to be able to unjam the mechanism by flipping the unit upside down. I can get it replaced under warranty but when I need to scan and finish a pile of paperwork in 2 weeks, waiting for a repair that might cost me more time than a scanner that should have been working for more than 2 months to begin with.I would not recommend this. Very cheaply made. A heavy book weighs down on the scanning glass and also jams the scanning mechanism."
5,This is a great book,I bought and built a good sized house kit home but wanted to know how a house is really put together and proper terms after all my years of remodeling and odd jobs in construction.This book covers it all from safety to setting up a table saw to building on site scaffolding or a simple ladder. Not to mention how to build an entire house!I still constantly use this book as a reference on many projects.
2,Self-adjusting whether you want it to or not,"This lawnmower is meant for pristine lawns only. If you have any acorns, small sticks or other non-grass items, the self-adjusting feature will slide on its own and you will be cutting grass very short all of a sudden. It adjusts from a cut height of 1/2"" to 2"". Start with 2"" and see what happens. As soon as you hit any small item, the mower will change to a lesser cut height. You can tighten the handles all you want but you won't be able to stop it.This is a simple, easy-to-push mower. I wanted to like it. But be prepared to get down on your hands and knees and pick up every little object in your entire lawn or expect frustration."
4,Taking the kids to Fred Hutch? This will help ease anxiety,"Families like ours, where one parent has cancer requiring a temporary cross-country move to Seattle's world-famous hospitals, will find this book a perfect one for soothing their children's anxieties. It has lovely pictures of Seattle--including one of the prettiest skyline shots I have seen--as well as descriptions of the people, activities, and history of the region. My six year-old was much less anxious after reading this book, and she enjoyed sharing it with her class as well."
5,Nice book,I looked around a lot before I spent money on buying this book and I ended up being very happy with it. My friend came over and started reading it and wants to buy it now as well. I just started collecting these types of books so I don't know first hand how it compares to every other book out there but I think it is definitely a good start.
4,Solid,"Written in pseudo-Market Wizards style.. consists of a questionaire/interview with some of the legends of this most recent generation. There is some bias towards mechanical systems, but the information discussed is beneficial to every trader. This is one of those books that you can pick up a handful (and more) of ideas to try out for yourself."
3,European hard rock,"This 1991 album was largely overlooked when it came out, but in retrospect, it holds up very well. It marked a return by Europe to the hard rock sound of their earlier albums like Wings of Tomorrow, and something of a departure from the lush keyboard-oriented arrangements on Out of This World. Here the guitar is more prominent, while the keyboards are kept in the background. The songs are for the most part above average, although not stellar, with decent melodies. There are a few standout tracks, notably the closer, Girl from Lebanon, but everything is pleasant and listenable. With 12 tracks running 54 minutes, this CD is a good value for the price."
3,"Nice, but not essential","Nice book, excelent pictures and lots of info related to the history of the scooter, including all sorts of stories about the role of the scooter in its day, but... The book chooses a few models to portrait in detail and leaves out a couple of important ones, including the rally models and the fact that its an ""official biography"" tends to make it lack objectivity very often.All in all it's like a big, beautiful ad for the Vespa and should be bought with that in mind!"
5,Magnifique!!,"I bought this cd for my 6 month old, I am Quebecoise, but living in English Canada, it has been hard to find a quality french cd for my daughter. I took a chance on this one, and we all love it!! There are songs about animals, and she's learning classic french songs, from my own childhood, like Sur Le Pont D'Avignon. I even listen to the cd after she's fallen asleep in the car!!! It would be hard for a non-french speaker to understand some of the songs, but this music will never go out of style, and if you are keen on your children learning french, this is a good way to do it, although you may have to search for the lyrics online if you don't speak french."
5,Delightful!,"Our three boys (6y, 4y, and 2y) *love* this cd! We listen to it almost every day. The music is cheerful and gentle and the singers are pleasant to listen to."
5,Spiffy Spice Rack,I loved this item so much I came back and bought two more! It is the perfect color and holds average-sized spices very well. Quit buying little spice bottles or really big ones so you can alphabetize ALL YOUR SPICES in these SPIFFY SPICE RACKS!They are easy to install and very durable and well-made.
4,outdoes the debut in half the time!,"Nice and immediate, with two absolutely grrrr-eat songs: ""The Beat Goes On"" and ""I'd Feel Better."""
4,Valuable information but could have been better,"The publishers chose to produce this book in the same form-factor as the original ""worst-case scenario handbook"" which from a marketing standpoint makes sense, but this would have been more useful if it were the size of a standard passport and thus could fit inside a money belt, for example. Also, it could have been printed on lighter stock paper to make it more travel-friendly.The advice on what to do if abducted by space aliens is certainly appropriate to a worst-case scenario but makes me question the authors' sincerity. The first handbook's strongest point was that it could be taken entirely seriously; describing how to deal with space aliens struck me as a little over the top."
1,"""How to foil an alien abduction""? Seriously--yes","The person is right who said that this is a lot of how-tos from manuals. There are no stories to go with them. And, really, ""How to foil an alien abduction""? Seriously--yes...not a joke, either. Not helpful and not fun."
2,Mildly entertaining only,"Initially thought the idea of the book funny, but in the end I was disappointed. I think this is because the book has no real story to tell, just lots of instructions on how to survive certain (very unusual) situations and drawings to go with it. The best part is the introduction where the author tells of how he survived Mt. Kilimanjaro - now that's a story! The rest is just a bit dull and rather a lot of common sense and mediocre ideas."
4,Practical yet funny,"At last, a book that teaches me how to escape a mass riot in a foreign country. I got this book because it had good reviews and seemed to be interesting. It is, its a practical, humourous, book.Its written in a serious manner, but there is obvious humour behind it, some of the topics you encounter are so obsurd its remarkable how these guys thought of the situation.It's a funny book that one day might save your life, what other book can you say that about?4 Stars. Not as good as some of the other books in the series."
5,WOW The Mother of ALL Silverware,"I ordered this set hoping it was really 18/10 and a good quality. I wasnt disappointed. This set IS 18/10 and it is extremly heavy. Very shiny and does fine in the dishwasher, no rust. The size is a lot bigger than I have ever bought. It is like the mother of all silverware. BIG forks, knives, ect.. The hostess set is really nice, I dont use them but it is still nice. The pieces are a really elegant design and solid one piece construction that is totally smooth. This is my bargain of the year, top quality and bargain price."
2,"Strong, looks great, but rusted easily.","First off, let me say this flatware set is extremely good looking. It's also lighter than I expected, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. However, I followed Henckels' dishwasher directions perfectly and upon pulling the flatware out of the dishwasher I found some of them already had begun to have rust spots. After one wash!I'm really disappointed. This was the first set of ""high quality"" flatware I ever bought. Even el cheapo flatware from Chi-Mart holds off on rusting for at least a few washes.I am in the process of returning this set to Amazon. Thanks for making it easy to return this stuff, Amazon. I'm going to search for another new set now...sigh. By the way, this set is made in China in case you were wondering."
5,Excellent flatware,"Nice size and weight, well-balanced, very attractive set. Haven't had the set long enough to say how well the mirroring will last but being Henckels, it's reasonable to expect good durability. Very pleased so far."
1,BEWARE!!,I purchased this product from Macy's in Jan. 2012; all the handles are corroding already. I am so sick of spending my hard earned money on cheap products made in China. I thought by purchasing a Henckles product I was buying quality but I guess not.
5,Good Product,Edited:Nice and shiny. Feels good in your hand and has held up well in the short period I have had the silverware.I would recommend this set.I have now had this for about 18 months. Still holding up strong and looks great.
5,Applied Measurement and Math for the Home,This book is full of facts and formulas that can help any do it yourselfer with home projects. Well organized and very well written.
1,"A real ""circuit breaker""","Item worked fine for a short while, then one day I plugged it in and it blew the fuse. You get what you pay for."
2,Poor production quality,"The first impression one gets when viewing this video is the poor audio and video quality. Was this video filmed by my 8 year old son on the family camcorder?The second impression is that Charley Lau is not really a 'people' person. His on camera presence is one of arogance and distain for the high school kids he is demonstrating to. He also continually 'name' drops baseball stars who have no real presence in the video.Note: that all demonstartions are done from the left side of the plate. This may be not be a negative issue, but it should be something to be aware of before purchasing the video."
3,A Good Armand flick,"Partners in Action is a good action flick and was a DTV Armand Assante film,good story and good scenes."
5,Gorgeous,"This watch is better in real life than it looks in the photos. It is very flat, which I love. It looks much more expensive than it was, very feminine beautiful watch."
1,Tried really hard to get into this book.,After pushing myself repeatedly I got through this book. I kept hoping it would improve and live up to some of the recommendations of this author. It never did. This is the story of a boy who dreams a hugh wave is his life. He attaches the ideologies of his life with the components of the wave. There is not enough depth to the story. The story fractures into too many different ideas that do not connect fluidly. This is not a story that pulls you in. You may be interested in this story if you study Freud.
1,Beware of easily breaking glass !!! Very thin !!!,"Love, love the look but all have broken with minimal use. One while I was just drinking water to take a pill and I nearly choked!!! Cut fingers and NOSE now!!! Very sad to say this about a Mikasa product but it is inferior and dangerous."
3,You are right!,Yes they are very thin. Just received a new set. We have a previous set a few years old but these are half as thick glass.They will be very hard to handle without breaking.
1,Glass TOO thin!,"I love the style of these glasses and begged my husband to let me buy them. Now that I have them I hate them! The glass is too thin and they break too easily! DO NOT BUY unless you just want some glasses to look at, but not use."
1,Flimzy,Did not think this was a good product. It was cheap and flimzy.It would break after a few uses. I returned it.
2,"detailed, perhaps too detailed","Purpose: I bought this book for my father who happens to read only the bible and has no interest in philosophy. If your dad hasn't been interested in philosophy up to now, don't bother. And don't buy it for yourself, either.Content: It's awfully thick. I appreciated Pascal, whom i've never come across until now, but the rest is either meaningless or commonsensical."
2,"Gorgeous, but soooo fragile!","As my friend was removing a glass from the cupboard, it basically broke in his hand. Recommend the manufacturer re-look the design. When we use them, we joke that we can't do ""cheers"" and touch glasses---and we don't!"
2,Jena,"One big detail that I could not get past in order to enjoy this book: how does someone who has been deaf for almost all her life learn to read lips? How would she know what words meant? The author even states that Emily has ""no conscious memory of sound,"" since she went deaf when she was three years old. A hearing three- or four-year-old can learn words, slang, contractions, nicknames, euphemisms, and abstract ideas as she grows. But someone who can't hear muffled sounds, inflectios, sarcasm, etc., would find it impossible to know what random mouth movements mean. I couldn't get past that to believe that Emily was able to read lips flawlessly (as another reviewer noted) in almost every situation."
2,Not what I expected to read,"Anyone wishing or has any interest in purchasing this book to read about or to become more informed about the Philadelphia Experiment will be disappointed.The first part of the book, talks about the credentials of the authors and then progresses onto the suspicious murder that took place about a man who allegedly worked on top secret projects that involved working with aliens. Only one chapter is dedicated to the Philadelphia Experiment. The Montauk Project experiment is referred to continuously throughout the book.The majority of the book talks about and to the 'few' people that were involved at a very 'high' level of security on the top secret government projects - bases created underground so the government could work jointly with aliens."
3,I never could've imagined...,"Some of the theories in this book will make you think. The book is split into a few parts, and only the first part deals with the philadelphia experiment directly. This book didn't answer many questions about the philadelphia experiment, but it did have some cool parts with ex-government guys who talk about all sorts of whacked parallel universe stuff and time travel stories. It wasn't what I expected, but it did make for a fun read."
3,not your typical dramedy,"The movie depicts a story of a little boy trying to save the life of one dog. It's not a Disney portrayal of a boy and his dog, but rather a more realistic telling of the fate of racing greyhounds. If you are a big Gillian Anderson fan, be aware that she has a supporting role here as the protagonist's mother, and so her screentime is limited. Also, beware of the lack of close captioning and the sick Irish accent and slang that is the language of this film."
5,Great book,Great hard sci-fi. Great space battle scenes. An interesting look into the future. Will definitely read the rest of the series.
3,18 month old likes it but doesn't love it,"This is a very cute train set for a toddler. The individual trais come together with magnets which is nice but my son gets very frustrated when the magnets ""repel"" instead of attract, and sometimes they come apart easily. As he learns how to play with the set better it will be a better toy for us. He doesn't run to it first, but we do play with it together. It was a good purchase. The track is small! So I highly recommend getting the extra track pieces so its more substantial. I'm glad I did."
3,tough but interesting,"this is a tough read for me, she phrases things weird but over all I am enjoying the story line."
4,I'm with the Band,I enjoyed this look back on a life filled with love and musicians - and the love OF musicians.It seems Miss Pamela was always trying to see the best in others while not recognizing the best in herself. She grew up in the most happening place at the most happening time EVER!! I wish I could have tagged along!
1,Trashy,"Not what I expected it to be. It just a diary of a promiscious women, nothing to be gained reading this book."
1,teenie bopper,"i was origionally turned on to this book after hearing about it on VH1. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed upon reading it. She just sounds like an annoying ""boy crazy"" teen. I somewhat expected that, and it would have been managable if there was any substance or real ""juice"" to the anecdotes."
2,don't buy unless you want to take apart and re -wire.,I bought two of these. The dumpster did not work on the first one so I changed the batteries thinking that was it. It still didn't work so I took it apart and found a wire was disconnected. I reconnected it and it is working without trouble. The other truck did not work at all so I took it apart and re- wired a few wires on it. I am a mom not an electrician. One good thing did come out of this flustrating experience...My sons think I am a extra cool for fixing their trucks.
2,Why Some Nations Are Rich but Most Remain Poor?,Culture and Prosperity: The Truth About Markets - Why Some Nations Are Rich but Most Remain Poor. The subject of why some countries are rich and some are poor has always interested me. The problem is John Kay never explains this in the whole book. Overall this book is a big disappointment.
4,Excellent Resource for Greek Studies,"I have several lexicons and I find myself using this more often than not. Many entries give needed background information, such as word uses in classical Greek and the Spetuagint, etc. like most mid-level lexicons. I also own the 3 volume work by Colin Brown, but that is a nightmare to try and figure out how to use. These 3 volumes stick to the practical format of alphabetical listings of the words, which means you need to know how to read Greek to find the word, but is time-saving nonetheless. Interpretational slants are largely absent from this work, unlike some other lexicons I have, making this a trustworthy set.This lexicon is good for those of us who lack the spare cash to go by Kittel's 10-volume behemoth."
3,Up's and downs,I got this game for Christmas and well let's just say it's not a must have. If you have brothers and or sisters or people that you have to play it with you. Other than that I can tell you that it's not worth the money maybe half the price or about $35.00. But if you want to spend your money on it go ahead!
4,The Best Party Game EVER!,"As if 5 Mario Party games weren't enough, the 6th one was made. Of course, I was a little skeptical that Mario Party could outdo themselves, but man, they did. With about 90 awesome mini-games, and the brilliant invention that is the GameCube Microphone, Mario Party 6 is the greatest party game EVER! (May I recommend playing ""Speak Up!"" in Mic Mode?)"
3,*Dies*,"Mario Party is Nintendo's most rehashed series. I think it needs to stop! I agree with GameSpot's review, this game is just new paint on a old building. The only new thing about this game is the cool microphone, but other than that, it is pretty much the same game.Nintendo should make a ""Mario Party Chronicles"" that includes all the boards and mini-games, and then stop the party."
1,Dane Elec Meizu 2 GB is crap,"Real piece of Chinese made French Crap (Dane Elec). I bought one and it was screwed up from the ""get go""... the touch screen ran constantly and the reset feature didn't work. Worst of all there was absolutely no technical support...zip, nada, none. No way to contact Dane-Elec!Don't waste your money!"
4,A bridge between digital signal processing and VLSI!,"This is a good book on VLSI DSP system design. I still hope the author could talk something more about implementation, especially VLSI circuit design. It seems this book covers too much about theory instead of design and implementation."
1,Edition mistake Pay per click search engine for dummies,"I have purchased the 2011 edition of this book and received instead the 2006 edition. I tend to consider an Internet year a ""dog year"" e.g. one year equals seven human years.This means I have received a 35 years old book....while I payed for a new one. Amazon has provided a refund but I am still afraid to try again.Jorge"
2,Pay Per Click Search Engine Marketing for Dummies,I honestly didn't finish reading it. I say save your money and Google PPC.
1,It was not in English,Description said it was for region 1 United States but it as not in english.That why I rated it the way I did.
4,Rubbermaid Pants Hanger,Takes up less space & keeps my slacks nice and neat! Does take a little extra time to hang them.
3,Works as described. Takes up more space than it should.,"I purchased several of these for my wife's closet. Her pants were folded and stacked on top of a shelf and every time she went to pull one from the bottom of the pile, they would tumble down on top of her. The pants racks solved that problem, but at a cost. She had to give up a considerable amount of space in the closet to install these racks. I really think that using slimmer hangers would have been just as effective and lest costly. No problems with the durability of this product and it does make the closet look customized."
2,"some good tracks, but some really bad","As a Neil Diamond afficianado looking to round out my collection with this disk, I was overall, dissapointed with the quality of many of the tracks. ""Soolamon"",""Kentucky Woman"", ""Yesterdays Song"", ""Thank the Lord for the Nighttime"", and ""Red Red Wine"" were particularly atrocious (Red Red Wine sounded almost like they tried to use the UB40 version, not the original one, and Soolamon were impossible to follow using the original lyrics)""I'm a Believer"", ""I'm Alive"", ""Morningside"", ""You dont Bring me Flowers"", and ""Love on the Rocks"" were pretty good. The rest were , , er, ah, ok i guess, but there are better versions available elsewhere.Finaly, the quality of the disk itself was iffy at best. Many times, in order to get it to play with the lyrics on screen, you have to start the disk over a couple of times.My recommendation is that if you can find the songs elsewhere, do so. if not, you'll have to live with the idiosyncracies of this version."
2,It's not a 'book'.,"I'm an X-Men fan, and I have been for many years. With slight trepidation and nervousness I went and saw the movie...I LOVED IT!! Stupid me, in my haste to read a written novelization of the movie, I ordered this 'book' with mighty expectations. I expected a written adaptation of the movie...sort of like what Terry Brooks did for SWI: The Phantom Menace.Nope, this is not a book revealing the innermost thoughts of the characters...It's a glossy comic book...and the art wasn't even that great.While I love comics, this thing fell flat as far as I'm concerned...I gave it away to a friend...who later threw it into the donation dumpster at Goodwill."
4,Reads Like a Classic,"I admit I am a big fan of the Bogart film version and had thought the movie was based solely on a screenplay rather then this B. Traven novel. Chalk one up to the bonus content on the DVD for clueing me in on this author. Many of the stories and sequences in the book have the ring of authenticity. The book is well written and the author either did a lot of research or, more likely, had experienced this lifestyle."
5,"Awesome, Raw, Real Comedy","This man is amazing and continues to be one of my favorite comedians of all time. Not for the sensitive types though- stick to the lame british guys if you enjoy soft, obvious humor. Watch Louie for real, honest to the bone comedy!"
4,Direct and funny,Louis C.K. - ShamelessNot for the easily offended or faint of heart. Louis C.K. tells it like it is and holds nothing back. I love the impish look when he delivers a good punchline. He is a modern master of blue comedy.Tim D.
3,"Good, Not Great","I actually bought this for my husband's Birthday. We love the show Louie and I thought this would be a good stand-up DVD to buy. It was good, there were some funny parts but overall it was just okay. I love Louis C.K., I think he's a great comedian but I thought it would be funnier."
2,too raunchy for my taste,"this dvd had some funny moments, but overall it was too raunchy for my taste. probably won't watch it again."
4,Change of opinion?,"Having read a few things about Billy Mitchell before this book I had already come to some conclusions about the man. This book was very well done, so much so, that I had to rethink my opinions of what he did and how he did it. I enjoyed the pace of the book the flow and the balance. I do recommend this book; it is a compelling story that explores difficult questions."
5,"A nostalgic, heartwarming experience","A great cast and authentic flavor make this movie well worth watching. It is based on Joe David Brown's novel; although some of the novel's best parts are ommitted, the film is true to most of the story. It deals with community and racial issues, so it's not fluff, but can teach and inspire. END"
3,Put me in the zoo,The book is about a animal that tries to get into the zoo and ends up being better off going into the circus because of all the talents with his spots he can do.The book teaches you all the things you can do when you try your hardest.The age level is 3 to 7
3,Buy original hardcover copy for over twice the story . . .,"Many board books this size are a great deal for little toddler hands. Our 2.5 year old was smitten with the size and content of these books when she was one. At first it was really used for a toy (some oral investigation involved), but they have remained her favorites in her continually expanding library.We give this one particular title 3 out of 5 stars, because the original has SO much more content (61 pages versus the 24 pages in the board book version). Whereas many of the other board books provide more content: for example, Dr. Seuss's ABCs, Ten Apples Up on Top, Go Dog Go and Bernstein Bears He Bear She Bear)."
3,It taught me about the Great Depression.,"I really enjoyed the book. There were some parts that lost my attention but other than that, I liked it. The only criticism is that I wish the book would have told me what happened with Janie and Lonnie."
3,This book is OK.,"I thought this book was hard to understand. I thought this book had no moral to it. Also this book was not that interesting. It didn't catch my attention at the beginning. I've read better books. But, I still think it was OK."
3,bleh,"i have read worse books than this one. This is a story of two boys who have gone out of chicago to make a way for themselves. After experinacing a traumatical loss they venture to louisana with help from a friend. Trouble always seems to follow the young brothers, Josh and Joey. Soon the duo travel in vain to find their friend in Nebraska. I wont ruin the end but this book is better than most summer reading. The story is well written. If you enjoy reading real stories than i reccomand this book if not then dont waste your time unless u have to"
4,good discription of the time period,"The book came alive to me because my grandfather was also 15 during this time period and left his home for the very same reasons (not enough to eat and a father that became increasingly angry at not being able to provide for his family). I think Irene Hunt did a great job at capturing the psychological state of people during the depression years. I found the book a good read. The middle part about the circus got a little dry and I didn't care for his awkward thoughts for Emily but other than that, it was good."
4,No Promises in the Wind: Almost the best book I've read!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Irene Hunt's descriptions bring the Great Depression to life. The suffering, anger, and courage of those who lived in 1932 are portrayed in such a way that I could vividly picture how it must have been to live during that time. Josh, Joey, their family, and those they meet, are believable characters. Ms. Hunt captures the emotions of her characters in such a way that I could feel like I was a part of the book. I would highly recommend this book to adults and teens alike."
3,It was okay.,"This is not really my type of book, but it's not bad.. It is about growing up in the depression. I learned a lot about that period of history. I had not realized people had it so hard."
2,No Promises with 'Promises',"This is absolutely one of the fakest books i've read. The events happening to Josh and Joey are extremely fictional, and you can tell that they are. The novel is also way too predictible, and it loses its charm before long. Don't waste your money on this trash read."
4,No Promises In the Wind,"This is a great novel to use as supplemental reading material while teaching about the Great Depression in a seventh or eighth grade classroom. Students will really get an understanding of the devistation the Depression had on people of all ages as they read of the experience these two young boys encountered. Hunt's portrayal of the characters makes the reader feel as if he/she really knows the boys. The reader will begin to feel the characters diappointments and joys as they travel across the United States searching for work. Trust, forgiveness, family, and perseverance are themes that occur throughout the book. These, and the many other themes which occur throughout the book can provide a great basis for discussion in the classroom. This is a book that both boys and girls will enjoy."
3,"No substance, but a good way to kill an afternoon","This book was definitely NOT up to the ""wickedly funny"" description on the cover, but it did kill a few hours with brainless amusement. I found each character's view of themselves OK at first, but the ""poor me"" attitude wsa really pathetic by the end. The characters had potential, but it seems as if Theresa Alan hit her quota of pages to write so she wrapped it all up in a nice little bow.""Kitty"" was a bit disburting to me - a very bizarre reference.I'd rate this book in the same class as Jennifer Crusie - no substance but a good way to kill an afternoon."
4,Easy and entertaining read...,"This was a cute funny book. Maybe one that you would take to read on vacation in the mountains. It WAS something that I was able to put down on occasion, and there were parts that I actually skipped. ( I occasionaly skipped some of Rhett's chapters.) Overall it was good."
2,"Shallow, light, quick read","This hardly compares to Ya Ya Sisters. Its an okay read, but it lacks in substance. Read it if your looking for something mindless to pass a night or two."
4,A decent workbook.,"""The Joy of Signing Puzzle Book 2"" can be frustrating at times, but in the end, it's a good way to see if you're grasping what you're learning from ""The Joy of Signing: The Illustrated Guide for Mastering Sign Language and the Manual Alphabet."" My complaints are for the word searches: the letters are in finger-signs and since they're on the small side, some of the letters look alike, like A's, E's, and O's. Also, since some signs have multiple meanings, you have to look up each word, per sign, in the search, which gets very tiring. Other than that, it's a good workbook. I recommend."
4,my first,"This book was HOT HOT HOT! I've read the excerts and had no idea just how wonderful it was! I do love Emma Holly's work & now I'm certainly going to continue reading her. The female character seemed more like someone I could identify with, Mrs. Holly made her very real. i almost felt sorry for her then...buy it!"
3,"A bit disappointed, too...","Although I thought the writing and plotting of _In the Flesh_ were excellent, I didn't find this novel as satisfying as _The Top of her Game_, _Velvet Glove_, or _Cooking up a Storm_. Emma Holly is a wonderful writer, but I missed the warmth and wicked humor of her previous novels. David and Chloe weren't as compelling for me as some of her other characters. Like the previous reviewer, I didn't find enough variety in the sex scenes, though they are depicted with Emma's usual gift for arousing detail. If the book were written by another erotic novelist, I'd probably give it four stars for the sake of its inventive storyline, but Emma Holly sets a standard of her own. For me, _In the Flesh_ doesn't quite meet that standard, but I'll be the first in line to buy her next book."

5,zappaesque new instrumental music,"inkl is an artist who with his first two albums already surprised attentive observers and conoisseurs of the Electronic and Art-Rock Music scene by the distinctives of his style and the abundance of ideas in each track.The Munich based musician models his compositions out of influences which stem mainly from the British progressive and art rock of the 70s, but also contain European classical music. But Zinkl wraps his details, hints and quotes in unorthodox sounds and new contexts. This zappaesque humour, irony and the very cunning use of dynamics have become trademarks of the Zinkl-style.Who else combines entertaining and gentle sequences so playfully and wittily with `difficult' and cryptic sections? In a world full of commercially formated and standardized musical boredom, the notorious nightworker Zinkl choses individuality as his option"
3,not exactly hitch,"Although I liked this film, it's probably because I was an early teen when I saw Quaid and Ryan together in Inner Space. This remake is NOT directed well; it's perhaps the sloppiest directing job I've ever seen. Chemistry is nice between Quaid and Ryan again, but it kind of creeps you out that there's supposed to be an age difference here (I really don't agree that Meg is convincing as a 19-22 year old), and Stern is as menacing here as he is in Home Alone. The script is fairly predictable even if you haven't seen the original, and in general the point of this movie was to showcase the two main stars, not to make a good remake of a good but weird old movie."
2,Cheesy,"Given that this is dated, watching it from a 2012 perspective, it starts out like a pretty intriguing film. However, what really lets it down, is the un-believeability of human reactions the characters display. It ruins it. For example, the main protagonist has been poisoned, and is dying, yet he's full of energy, fight, glib remarks and BS. Doesn't ring true. The girl - Meg Ryan - is kidnapped, glued to Quaid, dragged out in a nightdress, shot at with a nailgun, and her reaction is little more than a girl who has broken her nail. Doesn't ring true. Emotion in movies has come a long way since the 80s, but even then movies were done better. If you find the idea of a young Meg Ryan showing a bit of shoulder attractive, you may find something other than the plot to be interested in. I didn't find either worth the time. Cheesy movie - watch something else."
4,Get the drill!,"Got the hitch for my dad's blazer, for a lift for a hove around. The ""no drill required"" is bogus. The back bolts, the hardest to get to, needed to be drilled. My husband was highly frustrated. It took about 1.5 hours to install once he got the drill. Once the hitch was on it looks great. Haven't got the lift installed yet, but can bet it will haul it. Well worth the money. The ones we looked at locally looked cheaped and didn't look like they would would haul my dad's chair lift. This will with no problem. Highly recommend this product, just remember the drill for installation."
5,Deadline: A great avengers novel,Deadline is a great novel. One of the best avengers spinoffs.One of the scenes in the press room is a winner though I don't know what Patrick Macnee put in except his name. read itAlso read Dead Duck.
2,Wrong Book,"I bought this book, and it turned out to be the wrong book. Nicely enough of the company, however, they found out before it got here, and canceled the order for me, then sent an e-mail explaining the situation that they had accidentally listed the wrong book. At least they got the author right though. That's all."
4,"Overall, it's not too bad.","Given that I am very active as an instructor in first aid and CPR, and moderately active as an instructor in outdoor survival, two of my friends gave me copies of this book as a (semi) gag Christmas gift. The parts of the book that I was previously familiar with are pretty accurate, if necessarily very condensed.Obviously, this book would not be adequate instruction in any of the areas covered, but as a somewhat humorous brief introduction it's pretty good."
4,"Serious, yet funny and also practical.","At last, a book that teaches me how to escape being attacked by a mountain lion. I got this book because it had good reviews and seemed to be interesting. It is, its a practical, humourous, book.Its written in a serious manner, but there is obvious humour behind it, some of the topics you encounter are so obsurd its remarkable how these guys thought of the situation.It's a funny book that one day might save your life, what other book can you say that about?4 Stars. Not as good as some of the other books in the series."
2,Not worth the money . . .,"As something to flip through while browsing in the book store, this is okay. Just okay. Out of all the possible scenarioes these guys could've chosen they chose stuff like, ""How to Take a Punch""? ""What to Do If Bitten by a Snake""? YAWN! In this thin (!) book, the authors Piven and Borgenicht tell you in a straightforward manner what to do in certain life-and-death situations. The authors add no humor or life to their topic. They just lay it out as if they were writing a manual for the magazine pocket of an airplane seat! ""In case of fistfight, lean into the punch. Turn head slightly to cushion blow. Etc., etc."" As a gag gift, this might be humorous for about 15 minutes. Then, it will end up in the back of a closet. As anything else, well, it's not worth it."
4,Amusing party fare - entertainment only,Definitely worth the low price as long as you only use it for a conversation piece. A charming gift for the right person; although kind of oversold.A final note: the other reviewers are correct that the advice is *brief* and sometimes obvious. As a real survival manual it fails miserably. Read the endnotes and you will see they did minimal reserach. Too bad; but it's still funny!
2,It was good for a laugh,The best desripation of this book is it make for great bathroom reading. I think is a fun book to flip through. As long as you just read this book and do not try jump for a car you will be fine
3,Entertaining but...,"There were only a few of the ""worst case"" scenarios that I can even imagine I would encounter. However, the book was entertaining and well written."
1,Not worth paying for,This book was pretty lame. All stuff you could find on a Internet search site. I am disappointed I wasted a dollar on the item.
3,life saver?,"This book is interesting reading, but 99.9 % of the scenarios they list, probably will never happen to me. Oddly, I bought the book thinking this might have info on what to do if one is personally attacked on the street by another person. It didn't. NOthing about the best moves for a woman to make should a larger, stronger person grab you on the street, out jogging, or wherever. But, should I ever get grabbed by an alligator, I'll know what to do!"
