4,Passionate,"I found this book to be perfect for the 20 to 30 something age group. The language was age appropriate and the love scenes were hot, Hot, HOT!!. I enjoyed the story line and wished the book was longer. I read this book in one day- Good Job Nobia!!"
3,"Hot book, but weak plot","Nobia Bryant is one of my favourite writers in this genre, I've read all her books and was looking forward to this one. I must say this book has some extremly heated love scenes (I intend to perform them for myself-lol) but the plot is a bit weak, it needed a stronger story line."
1,DO NOT buy this item,"I just have to say that the copy I recived is a fake one.Sad but true.So, do not buy this item.That is all."
4,Fine Playing,"I am not, generally speaking, a Von Karajan fan. But this recording is top-notch, rivaling (though not surpassing) the famous Beecham recording with the Royal Philharmonic (and with better acoustics.) The stars of this recording are not the conductor, but the individual players of the Berlin Phil, beginning with a most wonderful performance by Michael Schwalbe, the concertmaster playing the violin solos. (indeed it was for these that I purchased this recording.) But each player in virtually every section gets his moment, and illustrates why, during this period, the Berlin was the standard by which all other orchestras were measured.My one disappointment is that the sonic extremes of the recording make it difficult for me to enjoy on my car stereo."
4,"Rough at times, but great otherwise","I bought this CD because of Scheherazade, but I found that the Borodin pieces are actually better performed. The music is highly melodic, and the Berlin Philharmonic played them with much enthusiasm. It was quite a pleasant surprise. However, Scheherazade was marred by mere average recording technology. Also, I feel that the Berlin Philharmonic did not play up to its potentials in this piece. The orchestra was not coordinated at times, especially the cymbal player. While this is indeed a disappointment, the excitement of the music still came through. Not very polished, but still very enjoyable."
3,It's a silly show.,"This show was done fairly well by Funimation. It's silly, even though rather crude at times. The only big drawback to the DVDs is that it is dubbed, only. So, if you paid more than $20 for this, you did get ripped off.If this did have the Japanese audio track, I would have given this 5 stars, especially if the subtitles were done well. I thought Funimation had learned from its mistakes about not releasing Japanese audio versions of anime, but I was wrong. I'm going to have to wait until the next one drops to $19.99, too, since I will not pay full price for half of a DVD set. This isn't a kids' show, at least as far as Americans go, so there's no excuse for this being English only."
4,DVD technical details not as described,"This is a review of just the dvd disc itself. While Shinchan is silly and hilarious to watch, it did not include the japanese audio nor did it have subtitles as described."
2,"Nope, not definitive.","Mutter obviously put her heart in this performance but her upper tones are often shrill, steely and piercing. I have heard her art to much better effect elsewhere. The total disaster of this cd is Karajan's accompaniment. His old-age tendency to indulge in slow tempi might work well for Wagner operas and R.Strauss, but it is entirely inappropriate here, in one of Tchaikovsky's liveliest scores ever. Karajan might have imagined that his luxuriant tempi would enhance the beauty of this work. However, given the distanced, low-resonance live-recording venue the overall orchestral effect is very dry and irritating. You are always left wishing he'd hurry up and get on with the music --- which he never does, because the contents of this CD are permanent!"
5,Hilarious and so true,"Having been through graduate school in art history, this book made me laugh until I cried. I have studied, written papers, and given presentations on a number of the subjects Kimball covers in this book and found his take on current academics refreshing. He uses a fine scalpel to dissect postmodern academic art theory, and offers a witty critique that is both scathing and engaging. Citing specific examples, he peels back layers of suffocating theory and redirects us to the works of art themselves rather than the academic intellectual's warped interpretation of it.Let's not take ourselves and our academic enlightened intelligence too seriously!"
3,3.5 stars: a captivating taster,"The elements of ""Music Has the Right to Children"" are all here: packaged in turquoise cardboard, with a braille label, and another backlit photograph (pivotal to somebody's nostalgia no doubt), this EP on the Skam label is both rhythmically sturdy and haunting in its tunefulness. The ingredients of the mostly colour-based compositions on BoC's album, on which the Kraftwerkian percussions recede into the backdrop, are still unevenly mixed on some songs here. The oblique redolence of the synths can at times seem at odds with the spare, insistent old skool hip hop beats. But most of the six tracks (including one later reprised on ""Music Has the Right to Children"") really catch, and while we wait and wait and wait for the next full-length, this EP -if you can find it- is highly desireable."
4,Fantastic,"This EP contains some of BoC's rarer (and more exceptional) songs. Their usual style of dark, sometimes hip hop influenced beats contrasting against ambient background melodies is definitely present here, and they do it as well as ever. Everything You Do is a Balloon is possibly BoC's greatest song of all time, and the extraordinarily innovative rhythms of Hi Scores and Turquoise Hexagon Sun coupled with the wonderfully dark See Ya Later and the fast paced June 9th make this a fantastic album. Although some of the tracks can be found on other releases (Twoism, MHTRTC), it's well worth the purchase, if you can find it."
4,im glad i got this,its a pretty good book. i want to get the other ones and see how they compare. but this was pretty sweet. some gore and blood. good stuff.
4,An Alright Book,"It was a good book, but it had too much going on in it. It was kind of hard to keep track of what was going on. It is a good book to read, though."
3,"good, scary, but a bit to slow, and very perdictable","This book was about a girl who had a mom who wrote about toxic plants. Immedatly, she is stalked, and figures out who the murder is. This book was scarry, but is moved very slowly. For example, she got 100 misleads, and so on. But it was well writtan, and Joan Lowrey Nixon is one of my favorite authors."
1,Uneven,"This cd begins with a boom of thunder -- not bad -- but the sounds continue to fade away until the cd repeats...again with the boom of thunder, which ruins any relaxation you may have begun. The rain sounds like someone is pouring a pitcher of water on the sidewalk. Save your money."
4,Welcome to Bug City,"The Bug Podz are a lot of fun to play with. There are numerous ways to build all of the parts together and my son loves to change around the Podz everyday. They are not large at all and can only house the smallest bugs. A large grasshopper would have trouble getting around the tubes. This product combined two things that my son loves: building and bugs. The pods and tubes are very fragile and would break easily if dropped from a high height or stepped on. Overall they are a lot of fun and I wish I had bought two sets so that he could build more elaborate ""cities"". Next summer I'll get him another set to combine the two."
2,A Dry Great Big Sea,The production of this CD/DVD is very dry and you should never be able to hear their many vocal mistakes that is common to all groups that take to the stage. Where's their vocal blend? Their first live DVD was so much better. It's very obvious someone wanted to blow this out without putting some time in. I love this group and I never miss a live performance when they come to Southern California. I can't believe they let this one out without some solid studio mastering time. I wouldn't bother. It takes too much patience!
3,"love GBS - not great ""Live"" quality","GBS is awesome... and the disc is pretty good (CD & DVD) but the ""live"" sound quality leaves a little to be desired."
5,Actually 10000000000000000000000000000000000000 stars!,This is the best song ever! It is brilliant and I play it 20 times a day! I know every word and I can not find a single thing wrong with it! BUY IT NOW!
1,"The ""Screamin' Demon"" of the keyboard botches more music","Horowitz wouldn't know musical phrasing if you put a gun to his head. If you just like to hear shapeless pounding on the keyboard, however, this disc is for you. If not, there are tons of worthwhile alternatives."
5,The Horowitz Magic Is Heard On This Disk,"This was an important event - much like the Stravinsky return to Russia in the sixties. A great musical artist returns home after too long a time away. While these pieces are not the titanic Horowitz of earlier decades the magic is still there.I was fortunate enough to hear him perform live three times. What I learned from those experiences was that he had more tonal colors on the piano than any other pianist I have ever heard. He also had more shades of dynamic than anyone else. His pianissimo was amazingly soft and yet it filled the whole auditorium. And when he called on his power the piano roared, but the loud seemed so loud because his quiet was so quiet.Every one of these pieces has a lot to recommend it, but I think the best tracks on this disk are the Rachmaninov, the Scriabin, and the Moszkowski. Russian speaking Russian to other Russians.I never want to forget how magical Horowitz really was."
2,So-so,"Some of his other work is much better. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention. I just did not believe the characters. I kept waiting for it to get better which is why I toughed it out to the end, but I was disappointed overall."
3,Where's Los Saicos?,"Not a bad CD but where's Los Saicos, the kings of Peruvian punk? Everything else pales compared to them. It would be great to hear Los Shains too. The ""product description"" includes both of them. What happened? Very disappointing."
3,Read Before You Buy!,"This is a great book if you are looking for a nice way to tell your child there is no Santa Clause. I read reviews saying that the book is good for kids who do believe as well as kids who don't, but any child who puts any thought into it will realize that what the book is really saying is that there is NO Santa. Luckily I read the book myself before reading it to my 6-year-old! She would have picked up on it immediately and I have no intentions of telling her there is no Santa yet."
5,Colossal performance!,"This recording dates of Dec 1985 . It is a live recording from Avery Fisher Hall and it constitutes a true musical document . Bernstein , conducting the N.Y.P made a penetrating version of this fundamental symphony of this notable composer. The wonderful and expansive presence of the strings , metals and woods are demanded requisites if you want to win with this work.Solemnity ; grace and fevered passion characterize this idiomatic performance .The last movement, the well know Fanfare for a common man is played with such dignity level that it will let you amazed .In spite of his fervent wisdom and noblesse , though it lacks the ardour of the version of the sixties but you can not always what you want . This performing is by far unbeatable if you dare to compare with anyone you choice .Memorable portrait and distinguished recording."
1,Windup Galatic Robot,The Galatic Robot Windup by Toysmith was a disappointment. It was damaged and could not windup. Why would a seller send a toy that does not work to a child? The only reason I did not return the toy to the seller is that the shipping costs cost more than this toy. I will not buy another tyoy from Toysmith.
5,Re-released in the Pollini Edition with the Piano Concerto,"Pollini's survey of Schoenberg's complete piano music is masterful, authoritative and possibly definitive. If you want it, it's now available again, coupled with Pollini's version of Schoenberg's Piano Concerto with the Berlin Philharmonic led by Claudio Abbado. They even throw in Anton Webern's Variations for good measure, so you get an outstanding bargain. I'm not really a Schoenberg fan, I prefer Webern myself. However Schoenberg's solo piano music is mysterious and darkly beautiful and shouldn't be passed up."
3,"Fine pianism, but not well interpreted.","Despite the compliments showered by fellow reviewers, I must take a different stance. As an avid Schoenberg fan, I could not help but notice numerous errors where Pollini simply misread the notes. It is a clear evidence that he has not done the work to understand the works, particularly the devilishly difficult Op. 25. His errors are a clear evidence that he did not understand the 12 tone row (e, f, g, c#, f#, d#, g#, d, b, c, a, a#... how's that off the top of my head!?) and therefore fails to present the series clearly.For someone who actually enjoys Schoenberg works, as myself, would be better served by fine, accurate, studied interpretation of none other than Glenn Gould."
5,Josie's debut--- still a classic!,"I know there are 'billys out there who don't like Josie's voice... but I LOVE it... To me it's actually better than Marti Brom's or Candye Kanes-- it's more expressive somehow.On this, her debut CD from old '97, Josie uses that voice to incredible advantage on cuts like ""Long Dark Night"" and ""Ain't Got a Thing,"" the latter being the only credible cover of Sonny Burgess I have ever heard (and I've heard dozens!)Josie (backed here by Hot Rod Lincoln) sounds like Skeeter Davis working out with the Perkins brothers in about 1959-- the music has that much cred with me...So if you like rockabilly and female honky tonk give this disc a try... her voice may be an acquired taste, but once you acquire it... you'll be beggin' 'er back."
3,"fact-filled, but overwritten.","I'm halfway through, and it's getting harder to choke down sentences such as:""Like tufts of hair atop a bald head, two groups of structures would survive within the fire zone because of the actions of residents and employees.""I get it, but seriously, we're not far from ""It was a dark and stormy night"" territory here.Time and time again, the author reaches for the cookie jar of bad metaphor without benefit of an editor to slap his hand away. The book, as a result, is bloated. (pardon me for adding my own, but I couldn't resist.)Such writing, and the inclusion of apparently every anecdote the author could locate make the book a third longer than it needs to be.Worth reading, but I wish a tough editor had read it before me."
4,Well written book,"It is a very easy book to read. I read it over a six hour flight. It starts with the very basics and takes one through to the most important of inequalities in Mathematics. While inequalities themselves can seem quite uninteresting, this book makes them interesting by focussing on the methodology used to arrive at them and the interesting results that they yield. The book is written in an easy converstational style, and intends to impart the reader not only with the knowledge of some basic inequalities but the authors also succeed in sharing some of the charm and fascination that they hold for pure Mathematics.I recommend it highly."
2,Didn't work for me!,"I love Jergens' moisturizers and they work really great. But I can't say the same about this toning cream. I used it in my butt, thighs and arms and it hasn't worked for me. I used twice a day until I finished the bottle and nothing. It was very cheap and it smells good, but that's all. I think it works fine as a moisturizer but not as a firming cream. I have been using another cream for over a month and it works better (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UJHSUI/ref=ox_ya_os_product). Yeah, it is more expensive, but it is worth trying. Maybe the Jergens product work, it has good reviews, but at least for me it didn't."
5,Helps with strech marks!,"I love this product! It made a HUGE difference on my stretch marks after only a month of use, the stretch marks are getting thinner by the day. Much better than other (rediculously expensive) stretch mark creams I tried. Way to go Jergens!!!"
4,"Soothing, not quite firming however","As a soothing agent and moisturizer, this product is great, and for that reason, i will purchase again, however, the firming effects are negligible. Additionally, this product does leave a ""coating"" on your skin, so using it after late showers is probably best. I also noticed that if you do happen to sweat during use, it leaves a bit of an oily feeling on your skin.But other than that, it is definitely the best of moisturizers i use."
1,You will regret you bought this CD.,"I was expecting more elaborate,fun filled music..i.e. full instrumental music to really perk up the celebrations....the various artists (I think only one group sung the entire selections) contained in the CD have brought DISASTER to the occassion.Another ZERO rating for this CD...don't buy this CD."
4,Well worth it...,"I got this for my daughters (16, 15, and 11) and they love it. I have the long model (90 feet) and it stretches almost all the way across the back yard. Even the 16 year old goes on it when her friends come over. They seem to really like riding in the dark.Installation worked well for me, but I already had a platform (a tree house project in the making) for the start and a perfectly placed tree at the other end. When it comes time to make the final connection, you'll need a couple of people to pull hard on the cable to be able to get it taut..."
5,Zip line really zips!,"After a significant amount of research, I purchased this product for my 10 and 6 year olds. My husband installed it from their tree house (12 ft in the tree) across our yard to the swing set (about 70 feet). The instructions are not as clear as they could be, with important details being a little buried. However, my husband and I are engineers, and so we recognize the importance of paying attention to these details. You want to be sure to read these instructions VERY carefully before installing. We made a brake for the zip line using an idea I collected online: a wooden block clamped to the line held by two, 6 ft long bungee cords staked into the ground. My 6 year old cannot touch the ground at the finishing end of the zipline, so this brake was a welcome relief for the ""mommy brake"" (I would catch him before he hit the tree). The brake works like a charm. The boys love this zipline!"
2,Does not work with Wescott's TD5 - spiderlite!!,"I have a Westcott TD5 Spiderlite and wanted to add a Westcott Octabank to my collection.Though the product is robust and hardy, I learnt, to my utter dismay, that Octabanks cannot be be used with Westcott's own TD5, on a TD3 you still need an adapter ring which you have to buy separately.With an appropriate adapter ring (you need to figure out which one!) - apparently works well with a ton of other strobes in the market!"
5,THE Gold Standard,"I've been doing this workout since 1990, and I just bought my fourth copy of this workout. I also like a lot of other home workouts, like Tae Bo and Cindy Crawford's ""The Next Challenge Workout,"" but Jane's Workout Challenge is still my gold standard. The aerobics section is simple, yet intense. The abs section has no equal. The balance section is a little boring for me, but I use it as a chance to cool down after the 20 minutes of aerobics. The fashions are now dated, and the music was never trendy, but when my body wants a workout I hear the music from this workout in my head and feel motivated to exercise! Jane, pretty please release this workout on DVD!!!!!"
5,Sweet Memories!!,"I was fifteen or sixteen when I read this book and I've never forgotten it!Yes, it's not politically correct and some women may find the behavior in this book appalling, but in my opinion this was, and still is, a great, erotic and moving novel.My original paperback is in a trunk in my attic and once every so often I take it out and read it. By the way, I'm 46 years old."
4,An exceptional insight into the human psyche,"I know that a lot of readers were a bit enraged over the whole date-rape thing, but I think that both Ginny and Steve used the excuse of rape to mask their feelings for eachother, and excuse an act that, according to moral code at the time, should not have happened. Why should there only be daring and free heroes? Why is it wrong for heroines to explore the dark side of their passionate natures and delve into the nether regions of their souls? Ginny showed us that a woman can be strong as well as beautiful and loving and giving. Rosemary Rogers should be acclaimed for her ground-breaking work in a time when her concepts were taboo. I have read Sweet Savage Love many times, and I plan to do so again."
3,"unoriginal, uninspired!","The only thing that makes this book unique is that it organizes Nietzsche's ideas chronologically, according to their development. If not for that, there's nothing that makes this book any better than the hundreds of other books about Nietzsche."
1,repolacement needs a replacement,quality of the product is nil this is my second one and i am loading it up with dresses and it collapses.horribly made.
4,Required reading...,"Required reading for all politicians and corporate CEO's who still don't understand how the 'Net has changed EVERYTHING. Dean's success in using the 'Net is just a tip of a huge iceberg. This book gives readers ideas on how to pick up the baton from DeanForAmerica, Google, and the few other institutions that ""get it"" and run with it farther and faster than anyone thought possible. For the betterment of society AND more profits.The book is also a positive message on the potential to change what ails our culture...the ability to get us all involved in deciding our future again. Go read it, then think about it, then get active. The tool is at the end of your fingertips."
4,Duct,The Duct vent came within 3 days. the box was somewhat crushed and the contents confirmed it was damaged in shipment. Lambro had a good customer service department and quickly shipped another one by a different carrier. It arrived undamaged. It was made well enough that I didn't have to tape the seams. I had to cut about a foot off its length to fit in my particular application and it did provide just enough clearance so we could close the bi-fold doors.
5,"Yes, The Best Book On Swimming For Triathletes I have Read","Like many people, I was skeptical about this book. How could I truly learn to swim better from reading a book. But after reading this and practising the techniques I am a believer. I am a triathlete, albeit a 50 year old slow triathlete. But I began as a swimmer, so I am very comfortable there. I am not fast, but love the water. But this book has made me a better swimmer. It's in the economy of stroke. This book will teach you a way of swimming that's more like yoga or TM than those swimmers you see flailing their arms and being out of breath. This won't happen overnight, but as the author says, if you practise at this long enough you will get better."
2,Does NOT fit the Blackberry Pearl 8130,"I got this case and liked the look of it right away. It was just what I wanted EXCEPT - it didn't fit my phone properly. It says for Blackberry Pearl, but once I snapped it together, the cut outs for the jacks and convenience buttons didn't line up. It was actually pressing on my left convenience button nonstop. Had to return it. This will not fit a blackberry pearl 8130."
3,"Outstanding, as long as they last...","My wife and I have a Martini, weekend evenings. I swill mine quickly, but she can't do that without inducing ""nap-time"". So we got a pair of these so that she could take her time and still enjoy a cold, undiluted Martini. They worked great! She could take a couple of hours to finish a drink, and it was still icy and refreshing. However, after a few months of use, the rim of the lower glass, for the ice, broke off in a ring! I don't know if it was thermal stress or what, but they both did it. Regardless, I'm about to order a second pair. At under $15 for a pair, I can afford to replace them every year. Prost!"
5,EXCELLENT,"The pair was excellent,they are extremely pretty and i have received tonns of compliment. Great buy."
2,What a drop in quality,"I think that the most interesting character besides Dexter was Doakes, but this season eliminated Doakes and in so doing, reduced the complexity and value of Dexter himself. By allowing that storyline to go forward and having Dexter do what he did. he is not avenging murders, he is what he was born to be a sociopathic, self-serving, serial killer, no more, no less. A great character has been destroyed and a character with depth is looking more like you would expect the brother of dopey, clingy, pathetic, Deb to look like. Not a good move."
5,Dexter groupie!,"If you have ever watched even just one episode, you're hooked. You definitely have to add Season 2 to your collection!"
1,Missing Disc,"I don't know how else to report this because I bought it as a gift a while ago and the return policy has expired. But the person that I bought this set for just got to the last disc of the season and found that two disc threes were packed in the set. Now she cannot watch the season finale because there is no disc four. Just a word of advise, check all of the discs as soon as you get it."
3,"Awesome, but DVD quality suffers.","Dexter is my favorite live action TV show that airs regularly now (aside from Corner Gas, my other favorite). This season is pretty awesome, like Season One. Dexter is playing this one by the skin of his teeth because his main body stash was discovered in the first episode, and his rival, Doakes, is on to him. Great drama.Sadly, while I want to give this season 5 stars, I really can't because the first new box I got had a semi circle on disc one preventing me from watching part of episode 2 on disc 1. Amazon sent me a replacement (great job), but on the replacement, the disc 2 had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. DVD quality is suffering with this problem lately. I can't encourage folks to buy an iffy purchase when the dvd's may be messed up, now can I? Taking two dvd boxes ot make ONE is kind of silly, and it's a good thing I waited to return my original copy to Amazon or I'd be in the same boat AGAIN."
5,"Different, but still totally Dexter!","This opening episode of Dexter has left me breathless. How will he meld these two worlds? And the ending of It's Alive has left me eager to see what's next. If you enjoy character studies, and can tolerate some ""heebie-jeebie"" scenes because they're a necessary component to that character study, you will fall in love with this series. It's right up there with Lie To Me, and Bones."
3,Dexter season 2,"Received it in time, however discs were wiped with something that has caused disc 2 to not work properly, disappointing, other discs work fine. Suggest that the wiping of discs be discontinued."
5,Question: What do you get when you mix,"some great baseball stories in letter form, a slew of awesome photographs, a nice helping of history and a sense of quirkiness and warmth? Answer: This book. What other book could juxtapose the letters of paul mccartney with shawn green? Or, Ernie Banks and Elizabeth Wrigley-Field? Or tie together the letters of Gaylord Perry and Buzz Aldrin? I found I could not put it down as with the author's other books, but this one really goes all out. I just hopes he keeps doing more of them."
3,one fair movie the other terrible.,"The quality of invisible ghost was fair,but the ghost walks on the other side of the disc was very bad picture quality.Buy at buyers own risk."
2,Bad Taste,"This particular color has a very bad fragrance and flavor to it. I don't know why, but it does. I won't be using this color. The actual gloss is fine, it goes on smooth, looks nice, but the smell and the taste will prevent me from using it."
4,soft nice plumpling effect,"I like this product, and the plumpling last for hours. at least 4 or 5 hours, which is a lot. I like the texture too, it is not stiky at all. I used to use Lancome plumpling, and it was way more expensive, the effect lasted a lot less that the lip fusion's. So 4 stars for this one."
2,too little results.....for too much $$$,"I have to say that over the years I have tried many different beauty products in pursuit of those lusious cushy lips all the celebrities have these days. From lip venom, to lip fusion, to celebrity sexy lips, all of these have given great temporary results, then after about 30 minutes the effect goes away and all I have is sticky, very un sexy lips. This product is also way too thick, which does help keep it on my lips, but my fiance HATES to kiss me with this stuff on. Also, this stuff tastes kind of gross so if flavoring is a factor when you choose your lip plumper then this isn't your product. My advice is to check out City Lips original formula its the only product I have ever seen any results with, and it won goodhousekeepings best plumper award twice, after month long testing sessions."
1,No Effect,I used this product for over two months. I didn't notice any difference in the plumping of my lips during that period. I used it as long as I did in hopes that the product had a cumulative effect; alas - I believe it has none.
4,patience is a virtue,"When I first purchased this product, I was less then thrilled. No plumping. But it was a nice lip moisturizer. Over the winter, I started having some chapped lip issues, so I began to put the product on in the mornings before leaving the house and at night before going to bed, just as a moisturizer. I didn't even use it during the day. Low and behold, within a couple of weeks, I really started noticing a difference. I would have given it five stars for effectiveness, however, I feel like the advertising is misleading. It isn't a one shot miracle product. It requires a bit of discipline. I believe that the difference between those who get results with this product and those that don't may just be consistency of use."
1,Berganza is a bloodless Carmen,"I bought this a number of years ago and was terribly disappointed. Carmen requires fire and passion, and Berganza gives a carefully controlled and passionless rendering of the fiery heroine. Other singers are fine; I love Cortrubas's somewhat rough but expressive voice, and Domingo and Milnes are always fine. I'd say try the old recording with Regina Reznick if you really want a classic, or try to find one with Elena Obratzova --sensuality personified!"
4,"the rave on ""all the rage""","I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT'S FUNNY, SAD AND INFORMATIVE. DEFINATELY AN INTERESTING LOOK INTO ONE'S ROCK 'N' ROLL EXPERIENCE. GOD BLESS YA ""MAC"" FOR SHARING YOUR STORY."
4,secret histoire of the CIA,"trento writes like a college C student...it was however a compelling read..these guys were were so treacherous..one question does come to mind however,how do we know that all Trento wrote was the truth??? after all, all they did was lie to each other and to us for 50 years...alan satz"
5,"Airborne Toxic Event ""All I ever wanted""","I first saw this DVD on VH1 and loved the fact that it was a very special night for ATE. I was not a fan of Nor even heard much of their music prior to seeing the show. But I soon turned into a fan because of that one night. I am a huge fan of live music and love the being in the moment vibe. This was a DVD/CD combo so I again thought it was very well done. I really enjoy the fact that this seems to be the way a lot of musicians release live DVD's Now. Adele's ""live at Royal Albert Hall"" and the Rolling Stones ""Some Girls Live in Texas"" both come this way and its worth the little extra you pay IMHO. If you are like me and love Live Music you will not be let down!"
5,10 min Solution is great!,"I love working out to this video. The exercises are all very different. You are never doing the same thing over and over again. It's nice and even flowing. The instructor is very encouraging. The ten minutes feels longer when you haven't worked out in a while, but once you start doing the video a few times a week, you get used to it. Enjoy!"
4,Reviews?,"This set contains excellent orchestral playing and is recommendable. However, some of the arguments for buying this set are ridiculous. ""Only Russian orchestras can play the works correctly""--absurd! The composer's life ""doomed"" (whatever that means) so the music can't be romantic. This music is romantic, no doubt about it. The composers of the Romantic Period had adversity like everybody else in life. In the case of Tchaikovsky, it was self-induced misery from inordinate preoccupation with his deviant sexual desires. Personal tragedy; Romantic music.Whether the orchestra is Russian or Western is irrelevant. What is relevant is the end result. Mravinsky's interpretations are idiosyncratic, but recommendable. If you don't believe me, read professional reviews."
4,The best 6th!,"I agree with Jeffrey Lee. This 6th symphony is superb! I have heard that Mravinsky was a tyrant and led the Leningrad orchestra with a firm wand. He was a perfectionist. But regardless of his unyielding demands and bad temper, his achievement to bring this orchestra to the hight he did in this symphony is unmatched by any other. Packed with passion and emotion, he maximizes each and every movement with fervor and despair. This symphony conveys life with all its ups and downs. In the end, you can imagine the nails being driven into a coffin as a statement of the grand finale and terminal end. Though rather depressing, it is a symphony filled with beauty and drama and I have yet to hear anyone come close to bringing it to such sweeping emotion as Mravinsky and the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra."
3,Okay but not the best...,"Look, Denon has a great reputation for DVD players but this one is only good. If it were 200 bucks it would garner another star. The picture is is fine. The controls are basic. User interface is okay.However, my main complaint is that if you plan on using an universal remote to control this player, think twice. I have tried to get my Home Theater MX-500 to learn this device but only to partial avail. Some commands simply don't translate -- leaving me to keep the original remote accessible in the event I want to ""rewind"" (and some other functions). It may just be a function of my universal remote, I will grant; however, the 9 other devices it controls work fine though.DVD players have become almost disposable in consumer's minds. I am wondering if manufacturer's have adopted this mindset as well. If they have, then price it accordingly. In the meantime, I guess I will be using this one 'till it meets its landfill...hopefully later rather than sooner."
3,"Jewel in a movie role , about The American Civil War","For a start I did not let the title put me off .I bought this DVD because Jewel was in it , plus a good story line of American history , ""American Civil War""So with that in mind , it was a interesting movie to watch . Once I started it I had to watch the movie to the end .Then I went to the bonus section of the DVD , AND ,I really enjoyed the Jewel Music Video ""What's Simple Is True""."
5,A triumph for an increasingly improving director,"Ang Lee's third major American studio film is arguably his best, where he treads onto a different period yet his all too familiar account of people in dramatic situations remains present. Tobey Maguire once again proves he is Hollywood's finest actor at the moment (and trust me, I am as serious as a heart attack when I say that) and Skeet Ulrich puts in another fine performance. Jewel was equal to the lead man and deserves all the kudos she gets for which is certainly an underrated performance. I won't nag on how this film deserved better than the reception it received in America (and Europe for that matter) and also won't go crazy how Ang Lee, for a second time was overlooked for an Oscar nomination for his flawless work. Just watch this film, and savour up the glorious 2 hours in entertainment it provides. Hands down, the best civil war film ever made."
3,Missing in Action,"The one MAJOR complaint I have to an otherwise wonderful movie, is that there are no subtitles available on the Criterion Collection version. How are the hard-of-hearing & the deaf supposed to enjoy this movie? Unbelievable that subtitle capability was left off!"
3,Entertaining,"I stopped watching TV and films years ago because with only rare exceptions both media are simply anti-western, anti-white male, pro-socialist propaganda. I bought this one on the recommendation of a military historian who swore this movie would not lend itself to such criticism. He was correct.The film's strong suit is not the plot or the quality of the acting (not that either were particularly bad). I enjoyed it because of the effort that was put into creating authenticity. The costumes, settings, and battle scenes are all crafted to look real. The characters are alternately bloody and dirty. Their boots are muddy. Their hair is unkempt. Their weapons are period. The cavalry charge is probably the best one ever filmed.Those who appreciate realism will enjoy it."
3,Dangerous Debutante,"This is the second in the Beckets of Romney Marsh series by Kasey Michaels. Morgan Becket is growing up in a slightly tomboyish way, taking part in the hazardous exploits of her family, which involved smuggling and evading the British soldiers attempting to catch them. So, her father Ainsley decides it is time she got a look at the way the rest of the world lives, meaning London society, and sends her off to join brother Chance and learn the ways of the fashionable world and hopefully get married. On the way to London she meets Ethan Tanner, Earl of Aysleford, who immediately wishes to seduce her and is attempting to make the first moves when it becomes clear she is no busty doxie, but a rather forward lady. Ethan becomes involved with the Beckets and eventually marries Morgan after many political manueverings in the Naval Dept.It is a good read, political and sexy and well-written.Linda Sheean"
3,It was ok,"But I just didn't really like it that much. I plain old didn't care for either of the main characters, and didn't find thier love story believable."
5,Funny and relaxing.,"I just love this show, and owning it is even better. I have bought many DVD's thru Amizon and I am very happy with all of them. Thank you"
5,One of the Best Trilogies I've ever read!,"Absolutely mesmerizing! If you enjoy reading about medievel times you must read this set. I read all three, one right after the other: Here Be Dragons; Falls the Shadow; The Reckoning and could not put them down.I will certainly read them again."
5,walk into that fear,"A must for any ""girl"" that fears money. After reading many articles and (other) books on finance as well as numerous seminars... I got it, finally. Money for me was not about the numbers games as much as it was about feelng insecure and using money to mask issues. This book is much more than psychobabble... it is easy, friendly, and definitely sassy. It helped me get a grip. So I stand here today and tell you I finally understand the importance of taking care of my money matters and really implemented so many of Sharon's ideas and suggestion. It is a breath of fresh air!"
3,Adequately Average,"If you have been completely oblivious of things fiscal and financial, then I suppose this is a good introduction to:A.)Why gaining control of your money mattersB.) what your attitudes toward money are and why (and how this may help and/or hinder you)C.) what an overall picture of financial health is.Ultimately, if you have at least an amateur level of experience of dealing with your money there are several other resources out there that can give you an actual plan to put into action- Jean Chatzky's book to help get out of debt-Pay It Down!: Debt-Free on $10 a Day, practically anything by Suze Orman (she has books for women specifically for women as well-Women & Money: Owning the Power to Control Your Destiny.Also, some of the consistent biblical references may be off-putting if you're not particularly religious, but all and all it's not done in a hokey or pushy way if you are yourself a Christian or even just a spiritual person."
3,A misfire that should have been great,"samuel Ramey was ascending as an eminent Don with the best bass voice for the role since Siepi, and the rest of Karajan's cast, except for the Don Ottavio, is first-rate. So why does this feel like a conductor's show, with almost no humor or humanity? Karajan was capable of much better, yet somehow both this and his Decca Figaro feel steely and impersonal, despite all the musical skill being applied. If others admire the technical accomplishment, I can't disagree. It's just a feeling thing."
5,Not For the Lazy Woodpusher,"It would be good to use this book in combination with another book of Alburt's, ""Secrets of the Russian Chess Masters Vol. 1 - Fundamentals of the Game"". The first two volumes of the Comprehensive Chess Course are workbook format and have a lot of fill-in-the-blank and analysis type questions. These two books will get a beginning chess player off to a good start."
1,Bad History Lesson,Just another very dry revised version of history that doesn't even get it right. [...]There are other books that cover these topics much better and give the true history in a spell-binding manner. Don't waste your money or time on this fiction!
4,Good read,"Good read... Being the first JR book I have read, he hooked me. I've already read the next in the series ''Map of Bones'' and although it wasn't as captivating as Sandstorm, I was still thoroughly pleased. Can't wait to have the free time to start another. Thanks for the escape James : )"
4,Loved it...a great read,I loved this book. Well researched and a great adventure. Rollins always manages to be inventive and entertaining. This will not disappoint if you enjoy his talent for descriptive narrative as much as I do.
4,Love James Rollins,"Ever since I discovered James Rollins, I have searched for his books. Somehow had missed this one. Enjoyed going back to the first of the series."
2,Omaha Dunn??,"Okay, if you'd like a stew of old movie serials, Clive Cussler without the charm, Dean Koontz without the intelligence, and comic book characters and dialog, here you go. This is the second in this series I've read and my last. The heroes are ridiculous and the plots fantastic and completely beyond belief. These might be distracting, however, if you're awaiting open-heart surgery and this is all they have in the hospital gift shop."
2,My last James Rollins book?,After reading EXCAVATION I expected more. EXCAVATION was not a great reading but SANDSTORM is much much worse. It is BORING. Not gripping at all and too long. Shall I try another one? I doubt it
2,"Not His Best, By Far!","Try another of his books. AMAZONIA was OK, ICEHUNT even better.This one is VERY late to get things going then fizzles and dies.Oh, and he may be a vet, yet his science is more fiction than fact!Dug-up...buckyballs to enclose ...antimatter - and all this to cause a couple of explosions and propel a boat...OKMy Advice: Pass"
2,Trying and trite,"To be fair, I've only read up to page 82. But since I have no intention of going further, I will comment on what I've endured so far.The particular sentence that sent me into helpless laughter and caused me to give up was: ""This is my colleague, Dr. Coral Novak.""I'm sorry. I know there MUST be people out there with first names of Painter, and Omaha, and Coral. I just haven't met them yet. But to have every freakin' significant character show up with a wacko name is just too much for me. (OK, there was ""Kara Kensington"", but doesn't that sound a lot like ""Lois Lane""?) All the women are beautiful and angst-ridden, waiting for a Real Man to straighten them out. Please. This is a long comic book, except the art work sucks.I give it two stars because Rollins spelled most of the words correctly and none of the pages fell out of the bindings while I was reading."
3,Not what you would expect,"Since we last spoke is not what I thought it would be. This album didn't have the hip-hop/turntablism sound to it really, it was much more electro. Although I think its ok (not 5 stars though), those of you who are expecting something like deadringer beware: try and listen to it first before you buy it. I got into Rjd2 while searching for more music similar to dj shadow's and deadringer and the horror were great but this one kind of veers away from that sound. The tracks with guitars and rock drums sound kind of weird. Rj's vocals are kind of weird too. But its not bad, its just different, very different. And it in no way is better than the private press, whoever said that."
5,blehhh! i am a sniper!,"i throw on this cd and immediatley i go, ""boo-yeah!"" RJ definitely is an american! with a track like ""1976,"" i go crazy... no wait! not crazy! but INSANNNEEE! and ""through the walls""... i just dance and dance. ""iced lightning"" is one of those great ones where you actually feel the need to sing along with the synthasizers. but the best track is probably the first and title track. ultimately, this record is the musical equivalent of danny tanner's proficiency when it comes to cleaning. goodbye."
5,"Very good, it is what I was looking for.",I needed to get my hands in this new type of connectors (FME) that each day are being used in RF devices more and more. I received them and used them with no problems. They seem to be of good quality. Only time will prove otherwise.
5,Great Book,"I must have read this book when it first came out in 1984, and it was one of my favorites. Now, reading it again later (for a Children's Lit class), I can see why. It's a bit sad, but a wonderful book."
5,"useful advice, quick read, essential for all film lovers","If you need sound advice, this is the place to go. Veteran actor Michael Caine illustrates his principles with amusing anecdotes. Even if you're not interested in film acting, this is a delightful read filled with interesting tidbits about stars like Stallone ... who apparently cared more about writing the screenplay to his Rocky sequels than acting. My only quibble is I wish it were twice as long."
4,Love Evil,"I enjoyed listening to the CD. Good stories, but it left me wanting more.. gonna have to get the next in the series."
1,Either Buffett is an idiot or the authors of this book,"Either Buffett is an idiot or the authors. In Financial Calculation # 6, the authors do a price analysis on Berkshire based on its equity growth. If you apply the formula to 10 years holding period versus 14 years you will get a different current price for the company. The current fair price of a company should not depend on your intended holding period. In that calculation using a 14 years of holding period they come up with $5499 as a fair price for Berkshire in 1986. If you change the holding period from 14 years to 40 years the fair price for Berkshire in 1986 (according to that formula) is $33,667. Now how stupid is that?Go figure."
2,Wish I could get my money back on this one,"I love Bollywood dancing, I love bellydancing, I love hip hop dancing, I love dancing workout videos. I did not love this one, I didn't even like it. First of all i don't consider ""the Pony"" a bellydance move. I found the instructor to be extremely annoying. I found it really hard to get into the dance. Like the title says I really wish I could get my money back on this one because I shelled out 9.99 for it and it was not worth it!"
4,To sum it up,"What others made a long story I will shorten for you.Dance off the inches Belly Dance has to offer:Belly Dancing - very littleBollywood - alotregular arobic dance moves - someFUN - YESGood instruction - mostlyWorkout - mildMuch better than the other Dance Off videos I have tried. This is just a workout, not dance instruction."
4,very satisfied with this product - really reduced my cholesterol :),very satisfied with this product - really reduced my cholesterol :)the delivery time was satisfying toothe only negative point is that doesn't really taste very nice so I usually mix this into a fruit juice
2,Worst textbook ever,"This text is full of information, but is disorganized and dull. There are hardly any graphs, diagrams, pictures....useful techniques to teach information. No chapter summaries. Lack of problem sets. No glossary. This book needs to be rewritten."
2,So long to a FANTASTIC band!,"It's sad that FNM have parted ways but now after hearing this CD I have to say it was for the better. ""Album of the Year"" in no way compares to thier earlier releases like The Real Thing and especially their best, Angel Dust. Maybe it was when the original guitarist left and the guitarist from Mr. Bungle came in that things started to go downhill for FNM. If you want to hear this band at their finest, listen to Angel Dust and check out Mike Patton's other numerous side projects."
3,Not very impressed...,"The album is fine. Thera are some nice, energetic songs, but it also has many fillers. The production sucks; apparently King For a Day... is their highest point in terms of sound. But if you like Faith No More and appreciate their work, you'll dig it."
2,"Funny Title, But Not Very Adequate","Despite some apealling moments that show this bands` uniqueness and stenght (""Stripsearch"", ""Mouth to Mouth"", ""Last Cup of Sorrow"", ""Ashes to Ashes""), ""Album of the Year"" is nothing special for the most part. The majority of the songs aren`t bad, yet they never seem to rise above average, merely listenable material either. Overall, this record lacks personality and staying power, presenting bland and not very intense rock tracks. Faith No More can do better and quirkier music than this middle-of-the-road effort without distinction or impact.Not memorable enough."
5,Judy Graman,My kind of book! Kept me hanging until the end. Anxiously looking forward to more Taylor/Graham mysteries!!!
5,Wonderful!,"I bought these books for my 9 yr. old daughter as a Christmas present. I ended up reading them before she did. They are wonderful stories, full of wonder and magic. Wonderful tales of good vs. evil. I highly recommend them. I could read, on average, one book a day. Great books, well written classics, hard to put down."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,The product was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived on time in the condition stated in the product description. The seller was very helpful when I emailed with questions. Overall I would buy from them again.
4,Audio CDs [Unabridged] Review,"Audio CDs [Unabridged] Review.There are 7 books with several CDs in each book (31 total CDs that play for about 1 hour per CD). There are several nice illustrations on the book pages and on the CDs. The audio quality is very good.A different narrator reads each book and they are all very good at story telling. I was pleasantly surprised to find that switching narrators between books did not take away from the experience at all.I listened to the books in chronological order (book 1, book 2, etc.) and found it to be very enjoyable.Over all it's a great value for some very entertaining stories."
3,Disappointed with the abridgement,"I loved reading the series, so I borrowed this tape set to listen to with my kids. The narration is great, but I was disappointed that the books were abridged. I found the audio versions not as meaningful with the changes."
1,Extremely disappointed,"The set I received was damaged when received. There was tape on it trying to repair the packaging. When opened, several of the CDs were found to be scratched. Was obviously not a new set as advertised, set was retutned."
5,timeless classic,"My mother first read this series to me when I was 5 years old. I rediscovered these books in high school, and since college I have tried to read the series once a year. Lewis' ability to speak to many different kinds of people at the same time makes these 7 children's books meaningful for adults as well. They are beautiful and rich, simple yet deeply significant."
4,Enjoying Audiobook,"I read the reviews about Narnia and decided to buy it. I really enjoyed listening to the stories, and I also recommend the order in which Lewis wrote the books."
5,Great book and illustrations,Our family loves this book and the illustrations just add to the wonder of the collection! We've given it as a gift a numbver of times as well. A must-have!
3,Wrong book order,"The books themselves get 5 stars, no doubt about it. This is one of my favorite series of all time. However, the new book order deserves 1 star, so I compromised.I wanted to buy a new set for my children, and I find out that some IDIOT has decided to change the order of the books. Chronological order is NOT always best. When I read this series as a child, I remeber reading _The Magician's Nephew_ as book 6, and thinking, ""So THAT'S why..."" Having this book first ruins that whole sense of discovery. When read in proper order, the reader has a chance to question many little details in the books, and wonder, ""Why?"" Having this book first answers those questions before they've been asked.The original book order: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magician's Nephew; The Last Battle. This is the way that C. S. Lewis had the series. Who knows better than the author?"
5,Great Audio,The audio quality is just wonderful and their choice of voice actor was equally wonderful. He does a great job of making the characters come to life. This set is making my drive to and from work something I actually anticipate. It'll be too sad when I'm done with them. I highly recommend this set.
5,Wonderful!,A captivating story of fantasy and wonder. C.S. shows people how to use thier imagination.
3,"Great radio theatre, poor CD quality","The stories are timeless, the story telling is excellent. However, several of the CDs had tracks that wouldn't play right out of the sleeve. No scratches or any sign of a blemish and it's always the last track that fails. Not on all the CDs, but a few of them. I'm not too happy about that. If my family could actually listen to _all_ the stories, I'd give this a 5, but in this day and age, this kind of rookie recording problem is unacceptable."
5,Timeless stories for all ages,"Read these over 30 years ago, loved them then and now. Interesting to read them in a different order. Classic fantasy for all ages."
4,amazing journey by: DS from North boulevard school,"The book I am reviewing is Chronicles of Narnia The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S Lewis. This book is about 4 children, Peter, Edmund, Lucy, and Susan who hide in a wardrobe for a game of hide and seek and find a magical land called Narnia. While there she meets a horse man named Mr. Tumnus. When the white witch comes and takes him!!! The children go on an amazing journey to find their friend. I recommend this book to any one who loves to read. This book deserves four stars because it is really good."
4,"Great work of a classic series, but Aslan's voice is disappointing","The CD series captures the story line well. All actors were well-cast except (unfortunately - regretably) Aslan. Other than that, Focus on the Family did a supurb job. If you've read the books, you'll not be disappointed with the CDs - just try to overlook Aslan's voice and focus on the story - and try to imagine what Aslan's voice is really like."
4,Not as Great as the Original,"I love the Chronicles of Narnia and would recommend them to anyone. But I think it's horrible how they changed the order of the books. The way they are printed now, they list ""The Magician's Nephew"" as the first book to read. It is not! The order Lewis originally wrote them is: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe-- Prince Caspian-- The Voyage of the Dawn Treader-- The Silver Chair-- The Horse and his Boy-- The Magician's Nephew-- The Last Battle-- I would not buy new books in the order they put them now, since it is not the order Lewis indended them to be read. If you read them in the right order they make a whole different story. But the books themselves are great--I guess it's the publishers I'm raging against."
4,Really good,I got the item in a good amount of time. I had no problems whatsoever and the product was in perfect condition.
5,Narnia books,"These are some of my favorite books. Lewis was a towering Christian. In the Chronicles of Narnia, he puts profound theology into enchanting stories. And the books are SO much better than the movies. ... Enough said :)"
5,Awesome,These books are great. This is a great value to get all of the books in one volume. C.S. Lewis is a wonderful writer. Enjoy!
3,The Chronicles of Narnia,It was in used condition but in very good condition. I was very happy with this purchase.
5,I love this series!,"The ""Chronicals of Narnia"" are a series of books about children who find magical passages into another world called Narnia. C. S. Lewis writes about wonderful characters that most writers couldn't make seem at all realistic or lovable. I especially love parts with Aslan in them, the way he describes the lion literally makes your heart beat faster. I could never say enough about these great books!"
5,Great book!,"This is an awesome book from C S Lewis. It is more than a simple ""fairy tale"", its quite amazing all the things you can perceive while reading each chapter. The narrative is great, the imagination and settings are amazing. Greatly recommend it..."
5,An excellent series,"I have been a Chronicles of Narnia fan for years, and took the opportunity to purchase a new set to replace an old worn out paperback set. If you are just hearing about this series because of the movie, take the time to read the whole series and enjoy all that is Narnia. I have always read the books in the originl order, but am going to re-read them this time in the new order and give it a chance. I like the idea of the hardcover set because they hold up better than the paperbacks, but aren't too big and clumsy to take with you wherever you go."
4,Fast read that keeps your attention.,These books are all short and easy to read. They are not exactly pretty to have on your book shelf either. With that said these books are great for all ages. I'm 23 and read all 7 books and enjoyed them all. I would recomend these books to anyone.
5,repeat reader again & again!,"I have been reading this series since the 3rd grade and have often re-read them because they are such an enjoyable set. I am now reading them to my own son, and I would always read them in the order where the Magicians Nephew is first. I suppose it does not really matter, as long as whatever book is picked up, the reader will enjoy them all for many years and want to continue to read them. I think this is a great first series for young readers, at every next book they will be wondering what will happen next in Narnia.....and they will be excited about it! Whatever book they read first, at least they will be reading!"
5,Pure literary mastery,"I just re-read these as an adult, and I love them even more than I did as a child. It is a priceless masterwork! The alagorical teachings in it are extremely well thought out and written, as are the characters and story. One of the (many) triamphs of this book is that it is great literature for Christian and non-Christian alike -- it appeals very well on both levels.In my opinion, one of the best fantasy series ever written. He and his friend, Tolkien, have pretty much dominated the genre!"
1,Story good - poor quality,"While I was reading, the middle pages of the first book started to fall out. The binding wasn't creased or damaged in any way. Even though it's a paper back, I thought I would get a few readings out of the book, not less than one. I am very dissapointed in the binding quality.The story was great though - my daughter loved it."
3,"Product excellent, delivery not so much","I ordered this product as a gift and requested 2nd day delivery. Product arrived in good condition, but it arrived a week after I had ordered it, which means that it was not delivered in the time period that I had requested and paid for."
5,Awesome collection,C.S. Lewis is wonderfully talented. You and your children will definitely love his books!
3,There was an unexpected variety of different publishers in box set.,"i thought all the books would be from the same publisher and similar cover styles. However, It was all the books from different publishers that had original cover styles and some with the the movie cover photos. The seller apparently Through the arrangement into the box and re-shrink wrapped it and sent it to me. Oh well, at least all the books were new and there."
5,Great series of stories,All the books in one. They have been rearranged in the order in which C.S. Lewis meant for them to be rather than by their copyright date.
5,The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set,These books are Awsome! As soon as I open one of them I can't put it down! C.S. Lewis Rocks... I enjoy the FairyTale with the twist of the Bible in it. These books are Great to read to my kids at bedtime... I highly recommend this box set as a gift or just for your own personal enjoyment. You won't be dissapointed!
3,Love the books....but very chopped up,"Since I know these stories backwards and forwards, the parts missing in the audio version are blaring gaps in a perfect story. Please don't let this be your introduction to Narnia, read the books first...you'll miss a lot!"
5,Chronicles of Narnia on Audio,"The Complete Chronicles of Narnia is a wonderful addition to any family's entertainment collection. Even the boxes and discs are beautifully illustrated. More importantly, each of the seven novels is masterfully read by a talented actor who breathes life into the stories and characters. We listened to several books while moving across country and it certainly helped the miles go by!"
5,Only one complaint...,"This is the first fantasy - the first real novels - that I ever read. (The second, for the record, was Ursula K. LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness). They are still among my favorite books and they started me on a long life of reading and imagination.I have only one complaint, and I know it's a picky one. The current printings have rearranged the order of books to put them in chronological order, not in the order they were originally written, published, and boxed together. Somehow, I just prefer to read them as they were. If anyone is interested, the original order is Lion-Caspian-Dawn Treader-Silver Chair-Horse-Magician-Last Battle."
3,Outdated but a Must Read,"I finally finished this about two weeks ago. I had been reading other books inbetween each of these. Word to the wise, read them in the order they were printed, not how they are numbered here! You can get by but some things just won't make sense or will be spoiled. All and all I thought the series was good. The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe is probably the best and is the most known. I liked Voyage of the Dawn Treader the most after that probably. I think anyone who is a fan of the genre must read these books, but like I said they are a little outdated, but that isn't really a bad thing. They can be childish at times which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4. I know this is a box set of children's books, but other serieses I think are more enjoyable to both children and adults on different levels. You should go out there and pick this one up and give it a try yourself no matter what I say though."
5,The cronicles of Narnia Boxed set,Im reading the 5th of the 7 books.One cant read fast enough to get to the next book!Fantastic stories!
2,"The book is Great, my review is on the quality and misleading NEW ITEM advertisement","I love the stories and bought this books to read with my kids in the future. It's a very good family collection to own. My 3 stars go to the quality of the product. The book is listed as new and the one I received, it way more than used. All edges are already white and scratched. the pages were turned and some even look like they got wet. I was very upset but my Husband was right when he pointed the returns policy will take way too long and it's always a pain. If it wasn't for myself I would definitely return it."
3,a bit heavy,"This book is a little cumbersome because of it's weight. If you like reading at a table there'll be no problem, but if you like reading in bed you may not like this format. What we do like is that there are pictures mixed into the text and that this book is a complete set."
4,The book of legends,Love the stories. Started reading it too our children. The eight year old loves it but the 6yr old found it a little bit too much and somewhat scary. For children would be better to read the abbreviated versions.
5,Book set was in better condition that I expected,"I bought the Chronicles of Narnia paperback box set used from Thrift Recycling Management, Inc. Considering the price was just under $5 and it was listed in ""Acceptable"" condition, I was expecting them to be pretty torn up. Well, the books arrived today and I squealed like a little girl when I opened it. I've been wanting to replace this set (lost mine when we moved years ago) for a long time, but didn't want to spend a ton on them. The set I received was so much nicer than my old set! Six of the books looked brand new. The other book (Book 3) had a small bend on one corner of the cover and some wear on the spine from normal use. I couldn't be happier since these are my favorite books of all time. Now I can read and re-read them over and over again like I used to."
4,"Not for the faint of heart!!! Hard, very hard.","Gin Miller is an excellent instructor. I will buy all of her videos. She is better than any class I've been to. This video is very hard. I like the challenge. Sometimes I'm afraid to do the video, because it is sooooo hard - even the beginners portion."
4,A great workout!!!,This is one step workout that had me working for the entire duration of the video. I used this tape when jogging was not possible due to time constraints and felt as though I jogged for 30 minutes after the workout. An excellent advanced step workout. You must try it.
2,The case was cracked,The case was cracked I hope the cd is okay its a gift and its bad enough the case was broken
5,great child entertainment,My 6 year old daughter loves this cd. She turns it on in her room and sings along. Great selection of songs!
5,ray gelato is a must!,"Well, if you like swing and Louis Prima, this CD is for you. I've found all the tracks absolutely fine and professionally recorded. Good Fellas are simply fantastic and Ray Gelato too.Add few bucks and get this title. You'll be not disappointed.Antonio, Milano, Italy"
5,Classic.,"I dont know how I stumbled on this album, but I am glad that I did. It is absolutely amazing to an extent that I cant bare to describe, the singing and guitars are some of the best I have ever heard.Its is funky, jazzy, heavy rock with a hint of blues and folk."
3,"Digital is nice, but the older performances are nicer","Bernstein, like so many other conductors, liked to record works more than once. Fortunately, his vision wasn't limited to rehashing the staples stable. In this case, both Harris and Schuman are given a 'second look.' While the digital sound is appreciated - especially in the final Toccata of the Schuman 3rd, the performances seem to me more humdrum than inspired. The earlier recordings of both works made in the 60s are still, to my ears, the preferred performances. Ogden Nash's famous bon mot ""Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker"" applies here. Digital candy, analogue liquor."
1,Sand from the Beach,"This is the worst protein powder I have ever had. I wanted to try something non-dairy, and this seemed to get good reviews. I was hopeful that this would do the job. When it arrived, I tried it in some water. I was like trying to swallow a mouthful of sand. I coughed and hacked. So I added some more water hoping that would help. Nope. Deciding I needed to get rid of it, I tried mixing it with yogurt, milk, cooking it into muffins. Nope. I nearly choked to death on the yogurt. Don't buy this stuff. Terrible."
2,Didn't taste good,"I'm normally not real picky about how things taste,so I wasn't real worried when I bought this as it was cheaper than other alternatives and I've been putting rice protein in my oatmeal for months. But I can't stomach this stuff. When I opened the jar the first time I had to look at the label to make sure they didn't send me something else. It had the smell of banana to me. I hoped after a few days I'd get used to it but I haven't."
3,"Serviceable, but kind of gritty and tasteless","The main advantages of this product are that it is super cheap, relative to the other vegan protein powders, and it has very high protein relative to carbohydrates. The servings/container is deceptive - one tbsp of this is not enough, I would say two or three.It's kind of gritty, even when blended. I also find it flavorless and thin - I never drink it as the basis of a smoothie by itself. Instead, I cut it with other protein powders, whose flavors are too strong or sweet. It's pretty good at the task of mellowing out oversweet protein smoothies."
2,Blehhh!,"I gave this product two stars based on the taste and texture. It is grainy, and definitely does not taste like vanilla. I'm not really sure what it tastes like, but it is very gross (at least mixed with a glass a milk) I have not tried baking with it like the other product reviewers have mentioned, so maybe that will help with the taste. I'm glad there is a product out there that can meet peoples needs who have allergies. Maybe the chocolate tastes better?"
5,Just What the Trainer Ordered!,"I loved finding out that I can buy this in a large size. My trainer wants me to get more protein, but I don't eat meat and my body doesn't respond well to whey. This is just what I needed!"
4,The Works of Louisa May Alcott (23 Books with active table of contents),"The Works of Louisa May Alcott (23 Books with active table of contents)like to mix it up, nice to referance back and refresh."
3,disapointing,"This movie was disapointing after reading the play. i felt the play had a lot more depth and the movie just didnt explore all of this. stick with the book. although the movie has some good points, i found the book to be much more entertainting."
3,A daily special book,"This is a very easy read but with a lot of characters which were, for me, a little hard to keep track of. It isn't a book that I would urge someone to read. It's not bad, but not exceptional either."
3,Playing: Excellent. Recording: Average.,"Zimmerman's interpretation of the 4 ballades, easily my favorite set of pieces for solo piano, is exceptional. Unfortunetly, this recording is blesmished with a strange whirring/scratching noise which I find very distracting. The slower portions of the 4 ballades are marred by this noise, and, although Zimmerman plays masterfully, I find it difficult to lose myself in this recording."
5,Full out Swinging fun,These cats know how to get a house jumping. They do some covers of old Doo-Wop songs yet put a kick of fun and an extra beat for those of us who like our music with a kick. Great CD. Great live band. Watch out for flames!
4,Big Six coming again...,"This second album is a very good one too. Though I like the previous best.The title song is the best. And it promises a much more than you get here. The sound is as it should be, but what I miss is slapping bass on some numbers.Blue Moon and Sh-Boom is interesting rock 'n'roll with reggae rhythm, Giving My Love to You is a rock 'n' roll ballad and the only real ballad that they ever recorded.Recorded with pretty much the same line-up as the first one with exception of Mike Sanchez (piano). Now piano is under guidance of James Sumner (Soul Hooligan).If the first record was mostly covers, on this one you'll find mostly originals.This record is 100% fun."
1,A Huge Dissapointment....,"Perhaps it's just not my style, but I won't even consider this CD to be swing. It sounds more like a 1950's sock-hop than a 1920's Dance Hall (Or even a 1990's Club). Everything from the tacky suits on the cover to the music itself was painful to me. If you like any real modern bands (Lee Press-on, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, etc.) don't get this. If you like the classics (Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, etc.) I still wouldn't waste my money. Preview this before you buy it, because you'll know by the 1st track if it's your style."
1,Aerobic Workout,"I was not impressed by this tape. Perhaps in a video it would be better, but I doubt it. It was difficult to follow and the instructions were minimal instead of being thorough for a sound only presentation. Much of the beat seemed off for the exercises."
1,What were they thinking?,"Why in the world would you release a audio workout tape and have a..., completely non-relevant counting track ruining the score? Buy this only if you want to be tortured or enraged while working out."
3,"Good premise, but didn't quite live up to expectations","I was very excited to read this book, as an art historian who lived in Florence for a time in grad school. I wasn't as drawn into this story as I had hoped to be. Susan Vreeland's The Passion of Artemesia is far better and more enjoyable."
3,"Enjoyable, but slow at times","I enjoyed this book, as it got my brain juices flowing. It puts the reader in the place of fifteenth century Florence, and gives a modern reader a feel for the social stratosphere of the time--women and the poor at the bottom, especially-- as well as the tragedies that might affect a person's life in the time--plague, death of children, theocracy.But, much like ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" I wasn't thrilled with ""Birth of Venus."" I can't put into words what about the novel didn't reach out and grab me. My boyfriend said to me, ""You must not like it; when you like a book, nothing can stop you from finish it... you don't even stop to eat!""So, in all, it was entertaining and informative, but not the greatest book of all time."
4,Worth studying!,"An enjoyable, colorful tale set in the changing times of the Italian Renaissance. My only criticism was that the author often pulled me out of the story when her research seemed to overwhelm the flow of the text, the characters' reflections felt forced rather than naturally spoken, especially when discussing art and politics."
4,A wonderful book,OK this book is a great read. All things are not historically accurate but that is why it is called fiction.
2,Disappointing Birth,"I read The Birth of Venus with great hope, based on reviews. I found it silly, trite, a sort-of feminist romance novel. It certainly is a fantasy, not a book of developed characters or place. We have the heroic, self-actualized slave helpmate, bad sex and fantastically badly written sex, Evil-doers, and a precocious girl/woman. A mysterious woman-fearing man who is overcome with love for the precocious girl. UGH!"
5,A must for every woman,"By far this is my favorite book of the many books I have read. It themes of liberation and finding happiness for women, is touching and inspiring. I have read this book five times and each time it touches me more than the first. Highly recommeded for every woman and peopel that appreciate art."
2,Mediocre,"I am a fan of Sarah Dunant, having read and enjoyed both Mapping the Edge and Trangressions, so I was enthusiastic about this novel. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The protagonist, Alessandra, is not sympathetic and it's very difficult to bring oneself to care about her struggles. The novel does have a few redeeming qualities - Dunant's skill with words and her knowledge of Florence. Her descriptions of life in Renaissance Florence are fascinating and carried me through the novel even when I had lost patience with the narrative. In fact, all of the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. Dunant is definitely a skilled writer but this book is not her best."
5,fascinating and imaginative,"I have to admit, I'm a sucker for anything taking place in Florence. That aside, I couldn't put this book down! The characters are very well developed, the story line not only moves along at a comfortable pace, but the developments and plot twists are mature, interesting, and just a tad shocking. I can not say enough great things about this--particularly as a vacation book when you can sit down and devour the whole thing at once! :)"
4,Anyone else offended by use of contemporary speech?,"I enjoyed this book. Descriptions of 15th Century life, art and artists, politics and religion in Florence are beautiful and no doubt accurate. The story is gripping.I'm no prude, but fewer minutely graphic details appealing to prurient interests would have improved the book for me.Most of all, however, I deplore the inclusion of contemporary terms in the speech. Each example shocked me back, at least to the 20th Century. How could her editors have let these pass?How can this be considered ""great"" writing, in spite of the many positive features of this book?"
2,Disappointing,I generally enjoy historical fiction but I really just wanted this book to end. I thought the setting was interesting but at times lengthy descriptions just made the book dull. I could have done without much of the graphic and explicit scenes (over the top - we get the idea without that kind of detail.)Parts of it were more engrossing and encouraged me to read on but honestly it got boring and drawn out in the middle and the ending seemed so ridiculous to me.Just me $ .02 worth.P.S. If you'd like a good historical fiction novel try City of Lights set in Buffalo N.Y. at the turn of the century.
2,The Birth of Venus,"2.5 starsThe book starts when a nun dies and leaves instructions not to touch her body. The sisters ignores them and they discover that she had a shocking tattoo on her body. Then book gies back in time when Alessandra was young girl in Florence. She loves to paint and when her family hires a young painter she becomes fascinating by him. But she gets to be married to an older man who isn't all that he seems to be and learns something involving his brother.I have to say that I wanted to like this more than I did. I don't know much about Italy and I wish I'd knew more about the things that happened in the book. I didn't feel connected to the characters and the only one that I wanted to read about was the painter, who isn't mentioned by name. I did some skipping in the beginning but it did get better towards the end."
5,Excellent!,"I loved this book. I recently read both this book and the Girl with the Pearl Earring, and I have to say I enjoy this one even more, although they were both intriguing. There is far greater detail, and I learned some history as well. This book has everything: sex, homosexuality, art, the French invading, secret affairs with the hired help, the boils, God's wrath, and the plague. What more could you want in a novel?"
5,"""Birth of Venus"" birthed a new interest in reading.","An interesting drama nicely tucked into a very interesting historical time. I was recommended by a friend to read the ""Prologue"" at the end; doing so and reading the author's ""notes"" and ""reader's guide,"" made the book that much more interesting and enjoyable. ""Vivaldi's Virgins"" (by Barbara Quick) was a good followup read. It savored my enjoyment and appreciation of ""The Birth Of Venus.""By the way, I don't generally read women authors, but these two ""ladies'"", if I may, books have certainly turned my head. On the book ramp is ""In the Company of the Courtesan,"" another Sarah Dunant novel I look forward to reading, as soon as my book partner lets go of it."
5,"The Herb ""Bible""","This is the very first Herb Book I ever had. I got it years ago, right after it was published and it was such a great starting point for the herbal knowledge I was looking for. The book finally fell apart from all the use it got and after not being able to tape it together anymore I broke down and bought a new one.In addition it has been my ""go-to"" book about herbs and natural healing when the other books just didn't have what I was looking for. There are line drawings of all the herbs he covers as well as easy to read info that isn't ""dumbed down"". He also covers mythology of herbs, folklore, fabric dyeing and many other subjects. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Beethoven and Kremer heard by a 2 year old,"Me and my very active two year old child sat through the whole Spring Sonata (programmed in a local classical radio station) in total silence, both delighted with Kremer's virtuoso interpretation. I was not amazed to hear that it was him (I didn't know at the beginning) since I already own several Piazzola CD's also magnificently interpreted by Kremer. My son said at the end: Mummy, beautiful music. I will buy this CD very soon."
4,An interesting school of thought on our National pastime.,"""Baseball and Philosophy"" melds different philosophical concepts with baseball. It tackles issues ranging from the credibility of the Hall of Fame with or without Pete Rose to the zen of hitting. Each chapter is divided into two sub-chapters (the top and bottom of the inning), and tried to show the game so many know so well in a new and sometimes provocative light.This book probably isn't for the casual baseball fan, but for those fans who want to challenge their notions of what they think they know about baseball, this book would be an excellent read."
3,Loch Ness,Love this movie but not the product. The first one we ordered quit working so we had to order a new one. Hopefully we will be luckier this time.
5,the coolest book ever,i have been obsessed with this book since it came out when i was 8 (don't ask how i had access to it.) i am so happy it's coming out again.
5,Don't be a jazz-prude...get up and dance!,"I've seen the band live, even promoted one of their shows, and let me tell ya, they know that there are mistakes on this record. SO WHAT! If you're a headphones and easy-chair listener, this CD is not for you. Like any live recording, it is not about perfection, it's about energy. I play this CD every week in my DJ gig, and no matter what song I play, everyone get's up and dances. If you want to hear Benny Goodman, buy a Benny Goodman CD. If you want the most volatile jump-swing asylum break ever heard, buy this NOW!"
3,Overpriced,"Apple monitors are seriously overpriced. It is a decent monitor, just much too expensive. For your money there are better alternatives.If you want a good photo editing 24in LCD look at the NEC 2490WUXi. It is about 200 more but the screen is much better. It has an A-TW polarizer which increases the viewing angle and comes with an internal LUT for better calibration. Colorcomp help insure even colors across the the screen. Check out Reviews and you will find it is a pro quality monitor that matches monitors 2-3x the price. There is also a 26in version (2690WUXi) that is Wide Gamut, for those than need it. It is about 100$ more for that version. There are ""spectraview"" packages that include a one eye calibrator and NEC's software. Check out Hardforum.com for LOTS of good info on the subject."
4,The biggest display you can get for a Mac Mini,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Apple seems to have solved the ""pink issue"". I have been using this display for over a month now, with no issues. No dead pixels either.I bought this display for use with my Mac mini. I started with a Mac hooked to my PC monitor/keyboard/mouse. I've always been a fan of using dual monitors on my PC's, but had no way to do this with a Mac mini. So I decided to get the largest single monitor that I could.The 23"" cinema works just as well as dual monitor for me. The extra wide display allows me to place applications side-by-side and not have to be flipping through windows. The display is very clear. It does produce more heat than I expected, but it is by no means ""hot to the touch"".The extra USB and Firewire ports are nice. But I wish Apple could have put more than 2 USB ports on it. They certainly had the space."
4,A quirky but amusing mystery,"Greeley, a Catholic priest and sociologist, writes a mystery series featuring Bishop ""Blackie"" Ryan as an amateur investigator. Far from being a procedural, this story spends more time on church and Cold War politics than it does on investigation. In this case, a Russian monk teaching at the University of Chicago is found murdered in an apparently locked room. The reasons for the monk's stay in Russia are more interesting than the crime. It turns out that the body on the floor isn't the monk in question. Though the Bishop's dwelling place is shot up by Russians, he never loses his aplomb. Greeley tries to leaven the story with humorous repartee, but the Irish jokes wear off by the middle of the book. The locked room question gets lost in the narrative, being resolved in an off-hand remark. The ending is anticlimactic. Yet the book has a certain quirky charm."
2,Iceland - Europe's Wild Gem (A Review of this DVD),"If you want a DVD about the wildlife of Iceland, and particulary birds, this might be the travel video for you. However, I was expecting more of a historical perspective as well as a documentary that focused on the people and culture of Iceland. I must say, I was disappointed with the DVD and would recommend viewers look elsewhere."
1,Poor Quality,"First thing that tipped me off was out of the package, it would not lay flat on a bench, when fully closed. I pulled out the extension rule, it was not straight. It is not a solid brass bar, it is a thin ""U"" joint strip of warped metal.When I extended the ruler around three feet long, one of the hinges wouldn't hold. Other hinges are also loose, and some are so tight it will snap soon. You are supposed to oil the hinges, but then the unit would just collapse.It says assembled in USA of foreign components, it may as well be made in China, because there is no quality control, but then again almost all tools are crap these days, nothing is made to last!"
1,:(,This is not the whole novela it's only the main parts. There is alot of it missing don't spend your money on it you'll be as dissapointed as I was!!!
1,It rocked on TV but sucks on DVD,"This novela totally rocked on TV! But it breaks my heart to have to say that it sucks on DVD. I know that I'm not the only one on here complaining about the editing but its true. They chopped this sucker up pretty badly.Don't buy! In fact, be careful of all TV Novelas on dvd. I've bought a few novelas on DVD in hopes that it would be a different story for every individual DVD set. Sadly I was wrong every time."
1,This novela was butchered,"Don't waste your money. The novela was cut so badly, it was very disjointed. Hard to know how you got from point A to M because everything in between was missing. It is 2 disc, but the 2nd disc is bloopers, filming, no story at all. I will have to fill in the blanks on You-tube."
5,Truly enjoyable story,"I picked this book up through Amazon Vine after seeing the positive reviews. I was not disappointed. The book is an emotional story of a couple's struggle to adopt a child in a foreign country.The book is very easy to read, though there is never too much time spent on any one part of the story (it jumps quickly between his home life with Vita to a harrowing adventure in another country). He also draws attention to the AIDS crisis plaguing that country.I would love an update to the story, as so much time has passed since the book was first published. As Zimbabwe's news hardly makes it to the US, I am also unaware of how life has progressed in that country since Neely left.A highly enjoyable book."
4,Cadence,This book was a good read. The characters were easy to love. This is a curl up on a rainy day book. I'm waiting for a Tracker to come into my life .
2,overrated mumbo-jumbo,"Having been touted by seemingly every magazine possible, I decided to try my luck with this novel. While the prose was definitively poetic, the plot was disconnected and often incoherent. Leave this one for the true ""critics"" if your a regular person just looking for a good read."
1,Not what I expected at all,"Based on all the glowing reviews, I eagerly bought this whistle thinking that it would be loud and easy to use. Not so. I need to blow really hard to produce any adequate level of sound, which is basically just a high-pitched squeak. I was expecting the whistle to make a shrill but booming sound like the ones that referees use, but this whistle doesn't even come close. Severely disappointed in this product."
5,A must for officials,I have used the Fox 40 Whistles ever since I started officiating soccer. These whistles are extremly effective on the pitch. It's very easy to control the shrill of the whistle on the situations that would be needed. I recommend these whistles to any soccer official or any other offical who needs a whistle. Great investment.
1,"Burner Covers, not so good","I returned the burner covers after inspecting them. Although they were pretty, they were cheaply made and did not sit flat on the stove top."
5,A MUST HAVE TOOL!!!,If you do much wood working this is a must have tool. Keep it on the table saw fence or in your apron for getting really accurate measurements on smaller work. Much easier to use for small work than a tape measure. I've been using these for 15+ years and lost 3 of them over the years and ALWAYS buy another one when I lose them. A great tool. I HIGHLY recommend this tool.
2,Amazon auto database flawed,"Wrong part sent, but not according to Amamzon database, also found wrong information stateting ""This will fit your 1968 Dodge D100"", and on a few other parts, double check different company websites for correct parts. Amazon's database for car parts is lacking for older vehicles, it's happened to me twice this year to return parts(First time ever in years). I feel like returning this 3rd item because it was suppose to fit my truck. They need a better auto parts database."
1,Don't dare read this!,"This is an awful book: Ayn Rand is insane. I couldn't stand it, and barely read any of it, but I didn't need to read any further to find out what a sick, twisted fascist Rand was. Don't ever read anything she wrote, especially not Philosophy: Who Needs It or Atlas Shrugged (her cult's bible). No, I don't hate Ayn Rand, since hatred is evil, but I sure don't like her either! Just don't read this book!"
4,"well bound, low cost and durable","the binding seems to hold up well through a full reading and multiple reference readings. even in my back pocket while biking around you dont see page losses, just some minor bends. I generally like the construct.:)"
3,Cute--with an interesting ending,"Definitely glad I didn't buy the film, but it was great for a watch. With all the CGI available now, I was really disappointed we saw so little of the dragon herself. The human action just wasn't enough to keep me intrigued all the way through."
2,This is definatly a movie to rent not own.,The movie is so dedicated to not being stereotypical that has become stereotypical. The cg is horrible and the acting is meh. If you want a movie to watch on the couch with some popcorn perhaps it's worth the $1 rental fee at redbox.
3,Good Watch - POOR Band,I've had this watch over 2 years and it works just fine. The problem is that the band has fallen apart twice (the pins holding the links fall out).
3,One great song,"I bought the whole album for one song - prettiest birds - It is a wonderful song and my kiddos know it by heart - the rest of the CD is really good, just a bit slow for my taste - But everyone should have this song on there iPod - it makes ya smile"
1,Out of stock,"I ordered this because it is suppose to be a great product and like the previous review, the seller wrote to advise it was not available and they were refunding the money. A complete waste of my time!!!"
5,An American success story,The book Rough Edges is an honest autobiography about a young man who was deep into all sorts of wrong things as a young man and yet turned himself around to be a successful US Judge today! It is an easy and entertaining read.
2,OK flag for one season,I was surprised that this flag was not as nice as I expected for the price I paid. I purchased a couple of other flags for less money from another supplier that had more detail and were much nicer sewn. I will not purchase flags from this manufacturer in the future.
3,Description is false,"It says above that includes 3 clone troopers and a droid, it's not true. Also, the wings, which should be assambled, are kind of loose"
3,Cool but will not stay together,"Overall, this is a really cool toy with a lot of features.....basically, the same thing that everybody else has written. The only MAJOR complaint I have is that it DOES NOT STAY TOGETHER. The wings fall off very easily, as well as the guns that mount to the bottom of the wings. It is very difficult for my 5 year old son to fly around the room without it falling apart in some way. It is also very difficult for him (at his age) to fly it around the room without accientally dropping the bombs (which is a minor problem)."
4,I LOVE THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the greatest toy ever!!!! I love the dropping bombs, opening hatches, spring open wings, and firing missles!!!! Get this toy for your Star Wars fan kid right now!!!! I might not include the action figure clones, but who needs an action figure? My cousins lost their R4-P17 for their Jedi Starfighter, so it wouldn't matter with the ARC-170 Starfighter!Trust me!!!!"
4,Not bad for Hart,"I am a huge Ellen Hart fan, although the Jane Lawless series is my favorite. I met Ellen a few months ago (she is a MN local) and she was very gracious and charming. At any rate, this is a good read--it will keep you guessing until the end. However, it's not my favorite Sophie Greenway. Still, a solid read. Ellen's got a new site up ..."
5,BRAVO SR. ABBADO,"Una vez más Claudio Abbado nos demuestra su extraordinaria habilidad interpretativa en el repertorio operístico. En ésta obra cumbre de Alban Berg. La obra es sencillamente sobresaliente de una fuerza psicológica tremenda, la interpretación de Abbado estupenda. La Wiener Philharmoniker está a la altura de sus antecedentes. La DGG se saca 5 estrellas, por la grabación y una hermosa presentación, con muchas fotografías de la obra. Qué más se puede pedir!100% RECOMENDADO"
4,INTERESTING ALTERNATE VERSION,"Turning a comedy such as Figaro into something tragic is not an idea that I find attractive. Yet it seems to me to have some merit, after watching this production. I consider this a DVD that is worth watching once and a while, bit by bit. Be prepared for a Countess who is too abused to have any fun cross dressing Cherubino. The Count is portrayed as an axe murderer, again this is plausible. I find many Salzburg productions easy to hate, but this slow dark vision has some traction, despite my initial thoughts of consigning it to the Eurotrash bin."
2,Boring to death,"The staging of the opera is boring, the movements of the singers are extremely slow and within 40 minutes you want to go to sleep. Perhaps the only thing remarkable is the vocal performance of Cherubbino, the other singers though good aren't outstanding."
2,""" About As Enchanting As A Root Canal""","This production of ""Figaro"" has to rank as one of the most ungainly ever staged. Although it has a cast of distinguished singers, they are sabotaged by a conductor bent apparently on proving the old canard that Mozart's music has too many notes. Perhaps this is why he lingers unduly over each one, moving through the score at an elephantine pace. Similarly, the stage director has eliminated whatever in the text is light, bright and sparkling, matching the conductor in weighing down this sharp comical satire with an inappropriate dourness. I agree with earlier critics of this DVD, wishing only that I'd read their comments before I purchased it. Question: Are there any productions from M22 that seek to do other than be ugly and boring in novel ways?"
3,"Different, but...","Musically glorious if you can accept the slow pace. After this no one should accuse von Karajan of slow tempi. Visually takes some getting used to. Not the usual sumptuous period costumes, rather stark but interesting. The ""addition"" of the cherub character was distracting and was in whole a negative for this production. Doesn't compare well with the Glyndebourne Opera production with Te Kanawa, von Stade etc. for total effect but musically it holds its own pretty well."
4,bring in the young people,I second a previous reviewer's concern about the lack of interest in this art-form by our young people. We need to get them into the operahouses and musical theaters and this production is just another way to accomplish that; most of them wont listen to any musical theater and equate Broadway musicals with opera.
4,"superior performance, great sound","Levine leads a stately, robust performance with much more attention to phrasing, dynamics and orchestral clarity than is usual from him. The vivid but unexaggerated contributions of the horns and trumpets are especially welcome. The orchestra's playing and the choral singing are gorgeous and the soloists are quite decent. Best of all, DG's sound is open, clear and fairly lifelike; it is completely unlike the flat, boxy sound they so often inflict on the great orchestras they record. The old DG recording with Ferenc Fricsay was more propulsive and Maria Stader's ecstatic performance of all of the soprano solos was matchless, but the orchestral recording for this version was pretty dim. Levine's version is an excellent second choice and enjoys the best recorded sound I have ever heard for a classical choral work."
1,broke in less then 4 hours,this train failed in less then four hours of use--never heard back from the company when i asked if i could return it for a refund or replacement
5,ISH,What a beautiful book for children. Gives them the encouragement to try - even if its not quite right - gives them confidence to draw whatever they want - I love the definition of 'ish'. A must for children.
5,Any video game fan MUST own this,"This game, along with about four or five others (thief, deus ex, homam2, ff7, jedi knight), are the only really good single-player computer games.Why is Baldur's gate so high up there? Huge game world full--really full--of things for your character to do or not do with plenty of consequences either way, tons of characters to interact with, some very difficult and challenging sequences, and huge replay value for the wide variety of characters the game lets you create. It even has a fairly good-quality story to go along with it.Get this game from whatever source you can."
4,differant styles,"I like the hangers, but my order had 4 packs of regular hangers and 2 packs of heavy duty hangers so my hangers in my closet do not match."
1,How is this good?,"How can people like the song play? Its by far the worst song this year. Heck, The Whisper song was better! I cant belive I see all thses 5 star reviews! Thanks to this guy and ALOT more, rap is dying. Please, if you like REAL rap, buy some Kanye or Common. I have spoken..."
3,"Not for the conservative, didn't see it coming!!!!!!!!!","This is the first Banner cd I have bought and I am quite surprised. Don't get me wrong, I like the cd, but I think it is for the 21 yr olds, not the 30 yr olds. I bought the cd because I saw the videos and I live in Mississippi(support), and anyone knows that the cd and the videos are totally different. This is one I have to play when my son (13), is in the room watching tv with the door closed while I am cleaning. Sad to say it won't get played much and this is my first and last cd. The language is down right dirty. He really went overboard."
5,Learn to sing or just stop it!,"Vintage book is a must on any actor's, vocal coach, or singer's shelf. The first paragraph on Breath reads: ""To assert that to breathe is to sing, or to say, ""Allow the breath to take care of itself,"" or, ""When the breath is correct the tone will be so,"" is to talk utter nonsense, and greatly deceives those who would like to sing and who might learn to do so were they given the right funadmentals with which to work. Never will they sing correctly nor anything like correctly so long as their study is from the angle of breath alone."" Sing it, sister!Other chapters include Tone versus Vowel, Attack and Poise of Tone, Consonants, Interpretation, Requirements of a Great Career, and Emotinos and Characteristics of Singers.Quite charming and rare. Red cloth covers with gold lettering Highly recommended."
3,"Great taste, good fortune unfortunately a decade too old","Got this book today. My expectation was high since I saw the images online beforehand. Unfortunately I got this book almost a decade late. The images looks a little dated. There are good elements of design and ideas to inspire, however due to the poor quality of the printing, the images looks faded. Its not a bad buy maybe its about time for a new version of india's projects compiled in a new book."
2,I expected so much more from this book,"I couldn't wait to get this, and now I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. There are no new ideas here, and the book is simply dull. Given India Hicks' pedigree, I expected more spark and flair than this."
2,VALVE SPRING COMPRESSOR,"I BOUGHT THIS COMPRESSOR TO USE ON A 4-WHEELER,WAS TO FLEMSY TO COMPRESS SPRINGS. PROBALLY WOULD WORK ON A BRIGGS ENGINE."
5,ACCEL Coil Adapter,ACCEL makes a coil for the Jeep ZJ Grand Cherokee but no adapter to make it compatible with the ZJ harness. I purchased this MOPAR adapter for the coil side plug only. Removed the MOPAR plug from the adapter and spliced the adapter to the original ZJ harness. The adapter itself is high quality. Easily equivalent to if not better then the factory harness components. If you're upgrading your coil and ignition to ACCEL then I strongly recommend this adapter to make your life a little easier for future maintenance.
3,Accell 140021AH Adapter,The adapter didn't work out of the box. I had to repair the pin connector- wire was separated from connector.
3,Regular,"Some stories interesting, others not much, I believe this is just another exercise of ""what if"" but not very interesting. You might pass without loosing much."
4,Standard Alternate History,"Nothing really special here, folks. A standard series of scenarios on an alternate history topic that's been done to death. On the other hand, most of the scenarios are decently written, and some are actually quite original. If you enjoy this book, you should also enjoy its companion book, Rising Sun Victorious, by the same author."
3,Find the cd version just for burndt jam,"As the product description is a but contradictory, I thought I would review the jewel case CD sungle.It has 3 tracks and the video for the title track. The tracks areWe are all on drugs - best song on make believeWe are all on drugs (urban mix) - a fairly awful remix of bad techno/industrialBurndt jam (live) - the only reason to buy this single, an awesome version of a great song which is unique to this single (and the japanese press of make believe)The last song saves this single as the title track can be found anywhere."
4,SO COOL! ! ! !,OMG IT'S THE BEST TOY I HAVE. IF U PLAY IT FOR JUST 1 MINUSE U CAN'T LIVE WITH OUT IT! ITS SOOOOOO COOL U'LL GOING TO DIE!!!THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT IF IT RUNOUT OF BATTERY ALL YOUR PICTURES ARE GONE!!!! AND THE BATTERYONLY LASTS ABOUT 6 HOURS.HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Very Disappointed!,"I had high expectations for this version, but was very disappointed. The quality of acting, lighting, filming, etc. was very poor. I gave the DVD away the day after I finished it."
3,Pratima,"Although I have not read the book, I did find the skincare online recently. I was a bit shocked by one comment I read that said that in the book there are ingredients that may be possible carcinogens and allergenics. This makes one wonder if you need the book to figure out what is safe in the skincare line."
3,Mahler !,I never know - am I rating the CD or the content? Content has been rated and discussed and critiqued to death already. If you like Wagner and you like the performers - what more can be said?The price is right and it arrived quickly and in good condition.
1,Leaking waterworks,"Looks nice, that's the 1 star. Turn on the water after the second time and you have Old Faithful aiming for your ceiling and you will also need a bucket under your sink. This definitely needs an o-ring. The split sleeve does not tighten enough to block the water. The plumber who CORRECTLY installed for the landlord will be back tomorrow to try to add a o-ring(that is not needed - according to American Standard). If it cannot be fixed, we will not be keeping this."
4,Great Guide,This book breaks down the publishing process in easy to understand steps. The book covers all aspects of publishing. Wonderful for the novice writer.
5,"Buy this good anthology, and never buy a course from these people","Oh Gotham people, why must you force me to bash you on the internet? If only you were simply a short-story-disseminating publisher, spending your days frolicking through the fields of modern fiction...bestowing upon me bushels of highbrow-yet-thoroughly-readable authors...but, no. You charged me $450 for a course (advertised in this book) which was probably worth...probably...$40. Everybody, read this fantastic anthology. But then tear out the pages beckoning for further investment, mail them to the publisher festooned with frowny-face drawings, and spend your spare $450 on 1st-edition novels and internet porn."
3,Maddening,"As alaways, Pollini plays competently, but when will the public finally admit that this beloved artist is maddeningly lacking warmth, poetry, and imagination? He is a stolid pianist who plays with virtually no color."
5,this album rocks,"i can never understand why his albums dont get the attention they deserve in the states. I feel its because the american people cant see David as anything else but an acting legend and fail to appreciate the true genius of this entertainer. The first song will make you get up and dance, then the second song starts with only a second or so gap, right after the first, its really good too. The third song is slow and dreamy, just the way you like them. Then the fourth and fifth songs just shake you!! they are tremendous. After that there are some more really good songs. Well worth the money. You won't regret it."
5,Flawless,After having 3 routers that I had to regularly reboot to keep the wifi working it's been very pleasant to have this router work constantly without any issues.
4,Easy to Use/Works Well,I'll give it four stars because I've just had it in service for a few weeks and have no opinion on it's durability though it looks to be a sturdy unit. Set up was easy; It works well and I get good coverage throughout my small two level home.
5,"QOS and Vonage, a great improvement!","Network traffic used to disrupt Vonage connections. This product, specifically the QOS feature, solved the problem. The Vonage box now sits on our internal network and I've given the device the highest traffic priority. All other devices are set low.The tag ""compatible with Linux"" might be misleading. This device does not care what operating system runs on the client. Windows is required of if you need to use the installer software, but I had no trouble installing the router through the web management interface with my Macintosh.This was an upgrade from a Linksys BEFSR41 broadband router."
1,Don't buy this peace of trash,"I received this router from amazon last week and had to return it a few days later. In my Apt. We have 2 nintendo dsi, 2 ipods and a psp. After setting up the router only the iPods could get connected to wifi, and the connection kept dropping all the time. The other devices could find the network, but woudn't connect. I tried all kinds of settings and resettings but nothing happened. I ended up going to my local Staples store and got a netgear wndr3700. It's double the price, but it works great."
1,don't do it,"there were no set up instructions to fall back on, when the cd didn't work, so I called customer support who offered to set it up for a fee. Forget this one, I'm sending it back."
4,working great so far for over 1 month,i have a 3 story townhouse and i installed this wireless router in 2 floor and the wireless signal has been great and stable. The only one issue i have is to set up security password. It's not a easy task on this unit.
5,Great Router,"This router is excellent. Not only does it do everything I expected it would, but set-up is quick and easy."
3,Wireless failed after 1 month,"I have been happy with Linksys network equipment and never had unexpected problems until now. I have a phone adapter for my Vonage and another Ethernet router that have worked flawlessly. This one was easy to setup and worked great, excellent wireless reception throughout the house, then at the 1 month mark the wireless just quit working. I tried resetting the router, and it worked for about 5 minutes, then back to no wireless. I hope I just got a bad one so I am in the process of getting it replaced with the same. We will see if the new one works better.Before getting this one I tried out a D-link DIR-615 and it was horrible, poor range (barely could transmit from one room to the next), so it got returned right away. I am keeping my fingers crossed for the new Linksys, as I have been happy with my other equipment."
5,Best bang for your buck,I've owned various routers in my long computing history. Linksys always produced the most reliable ones. This router is no different. Excellent build quality and does it's job. Don't waste your time on anything else.
5,Easy to install & use,"I didn't know what kind of wireless product to get and asked other people what they had. They told me to buy Linksys, so I did. I installed it myself and with the CD, it was easy to do. I have enjoyed having the wireless connection for my new computer and have no problems with it."
2,Poorer reception than my old US Robotics router,"Previously was using an old US Robotics router - this worked okay, but the reception wasn't great upstairs (router was recently moved to a downstairs office), and every couple of weeks or so it would go down and require a reboot. Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews on amazon, I thought it'd be worth it to try this new router as an upgrade - but the reception is even worse than before, and it requires a reboot even more frequently. I've switched back to the US Robotics router."
1,I recevied a USED one!,"I purchased this router for a relative of mine. I recently opened the package to find that I received a USED router. There were scratches on the top of the router and the ""install the software first warning sticker"" that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature. Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker. I am not happy about this. I expect more from Amazon and Linksys. I'm guessing I received a return, refurb, or something along those lines. A new item does not look like this. This is the second time in a few months this has happened to me with a purchase coming directly from Amazon. The first issue was with a computer subwoofer from Logitech that had a large scuff mark on the top of it. My guess is someone was resting their shoes on it. It is very noticeable."
1,Never buy Cisco Linksys Router Again!,Linksys routers are a great product for the price. God forbid you ever have to call their tech support! I have been on the phone for almost 7 hours now (4 calls) and the router still doesn't work properly. I finally gave up and bought an Airport Extreme from Apple and (though more expensive) it was so easy to configure and is working perfectly! A tech support friend warned me that he has spent two hours on the phone with Linksys just to return one under warranty. No more Linksys for me!
2,signal is crap delivery is crap,"The delivery of this item was really fast, too fast, the driver for the delivery company used by Amazon did not attempt to bring the item to me, they simply dropped it in the atrium of my apartment building and it was taken. It took me over two hours to find it and get it back, on top of the company that delivered it promising to send the driver back out to help and he never showed back up. The wifi itself is so weak that I cannot pick it up on my touch pad even in the next room. Amazon, Linksys and the delivery company all FAIL."
2,Lasted exactly one year and 1 day,"I bought it on December 7, 2010, and it died last evening (Dec 9, 2011). Actually less than a year because at least 5-6 days was shipping time. I don't recall when I received it.It dropped the connection intermittently during the time I had it.I don't know how long the warranty is for. It doesn't make any difference, I don't want to have to wait while it's being returned, repaired, and sent back to me. I'd have to pay at least the cost of shipping it back to the company.I ordered a Medialink - Wireless N Router. I hope I have better luck with it."
5,An excellent router,"I got this product to replace a WRT54G (v.5) router which I've been using with a Linksys Range ExtenderLinksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G. At a distance of over 200 feet the old router dropped the signal about half the time, but the new WRT54GL router provides a strong and consistent signal all the time."
1,Installation,"Wit help from Linksys customer service I attempte to install this Router withOUT success. We spent the better part of an hour in this attempt before I just quit and sent the unit back for refund, which I received promptly. The service person I had was in the Phillipines and she could not undestand me nor I her"
2,Has problems,The Linksys WRT54GL Wireless G Broadband Router has some connectivity issues. Every week I need to reboot it at least once.
1,CAUTION: DOES NOT SUPPORT MAC!!!!,"Linksys is great. My old router was a linksys, same number except for that little L. So i guess that means limited to PC and will not support MAC! It has Mac filters, but won't work on one."
3,WARNING!,"This thing requires an external modem for internet access. The port labeled ""internet"" will take a phone/DSL line with a ""click"" but it will NOT be able to connect to the internet using your PC's internal modem. All computers connected to it will be able to access each other but not the internet, even if they all have internal modems that work with the inferior, but apparently more flexible, router Verizon sent you when you signed up.Other than that, it's fairly easy to set up IF you know enough about your internet service. During setup it will ask for your connection type and IP address. The instructions are just a set-up guide, NOT an actual user's manual, so even if you have an external modem for it to work with (Cisco-Linksys sells one that's made to stack nicely with this) there is likely a phone call to India in your future."
1,horrible,"I've had this for a couple weeks now, and it is bad. I was so excited by all the good reviews, but the reception is horrible. I live in a 900sqft apartment, and I still can't get a solid signal. The signal constantly goes in and out, signing me out of ichat and disrupting video loads. The speed is also not that great. This is cheap for a reason. I will be returning the router for sure! I'd rather be plugged via ethernet than deal with this."
1,Not as advertised.,"The item arrived quickly from Amazon, which is typical of most of my purchases. However, that's where the satisfaction ends. The product did not automatically install with my computer, and I ended up calling tech support in India. The agent was knowledgeable of her topic, however, she was only able to help me connect one computer. The item did not perform as expected, and I had issues connecting my PS3 to the wireless network, as well as my daughter's DSi. The netbook would not connect at all, even after completing the linksys troubleshooting steps.I had purchased the item because linksys is reported to be the best on the market, but it did not meet my expectations. Perhaps you should purchase this one if you are knowledgeable enough to manually connect the wireless router to all your devices."
4,WRT54GL - still best choice with -g computers,"Wanted a Linksys/Cisco -n device with good reviews for future expandability but did not see any under $100 devices so went with old standby WRT54GL. Great reception, easy install for basic sharing of clearwire with two PCs - one connected by cable & the other wireless."
1,It's a total ripoff,"We bought one of these routers. It failed (no WiFi) so we bought another one just like it. Then after a couple of months THAT also failed with the same symptom. Trying to talk to Tech Support we were connected with a real wise guy in India. He finally said we needed upgrades but he could fix it for about $100. Since the original cost was less than that, and since we really didn't believe him, we hung up. Needless to say we bought another brand and it is working just fine."
3,Works but....,Works BUT the default is no encryption and it is murder to turn it on. My son-in-law got a Belkin and it was a cinch
4,All a wireless network at home with a single apparatus. Good-bye to the cables.,"I am very happy with my new one router, I had seen these apparatuses but never had been able to have one. Not even that were so useful.Very easy to configure. I could not install it with the CD that brings, but since in the browser is very easy and in few minutes this installed."
2,Extremely Slow Connection Speed,"I owned a Netgear router for 7 years. It was working fine until about a few months ago when it started to continuously drop out. I couldn't stay connected for more than an hour at a time.So I decided to change my router with this Cisco-Linksys router as the reviews were generally positive. I installed the software and connected to the router without any problems and the connection speed was great for a few minutes until the speed dropped to 1 Mbps. I tried restarting the router and each time the speed would reset to 54 Mbps but then it would drop back to 1 Mbps a minute or two later.I tried adjusting the settings to no avail. Reading the reviews, it seems its hit or miss with this router, so I'm giving it two stars. Shipped back to Amazon the next day and easy return service as usual.I bought a Dlink router instead for less than half the price of this Cisco-Linksys router and it has been working great."
2,Incompatible with my Verizon set-up!,Use extreme caution if buying this to use with a Verizon DSL set-up. I have been on the phone for 3 days with their representatives and am still not able to use my new laptop unless it is hard-wired. They have reconfigured to a bridge mode and spent several hours trying to make this work and it just doesn't. I am going to have to either change carriers or get another router to be able to use the laptop here at home. I wish I had known this before I purchased something with such stellar reviews.
3,Mac friendly would help,"Having to get installation instructions online for a router just seems silly, since more than likely you will be off-line during the installation process. Why can't more products be Mac friendly and at least provide printed instructions with the product. Frustrating to say the least. I'm sure it is a good product - if I ever get it installed."
5,WOW,This wireless router works awesome. I can get signal across the street in my neighbors living room!
1,Bitter disappointment and complete waste of time,"This was an excruciatingly difficult piece of equipment to set up.The menus for setting the security settings were confusing and locked me out of the network. Even after pushing the reset button I couldn't get in. The package claims 7/24 tech support, but I couldn't find a phone number in any of the included paperwork, or on the package. I guess you need internet access to get the toll free number. The setup software was useless. I have had other wireless devices before that were much easier to set up, including Belkin and Westell devices. If you only have advanced computer skills, and if you don't have IT people at your disposal, I would recommend avoiding this device."
1,wow how bad this was,ok so i guess im supposed to will thisa thing to work no power cord how can you sell electronics and not send a powercordi made my payment what if i omitted the actual cash in my payment.
2,No good for newer eletronics-mac mini,"Just bought this but it's over 30 days now. New TV with Netflix dingle still drops signal. Bought a new Mac Mini and after two days trying to connect to the net, an Apple wireless professional said these ""G"" routers are 4 year old technology. He thinks that G does not support the new Mac Mini or other new electronics very well. Now I have to go purchase a new ""N"" router. I thought I did my research but I guess not enough. At least list that these old ""G"" routers are not the best for newer electronics."
1,Best Router Ever Died in 6 months RIP,It worked good right up until it breathed its last breath. $50 for six months use. I should have purchased the extended warantee. I wanted so much to like you because you were so pretty. Now you are just so much e-waste.UPDATE:I called Cisco today to try and validate my warantee. They tell me that the G standard is obsolete and that they can reconfigure my dead router. The call ended when I threw this obsolete piece of dog foreign matter in the trash. I found out just because it doesn't work doesn't necessarily mean it is defective???? What the cluck does that mean? Shame on Cisco for such a poor design and shame on Amazon for selling outdated mechandise
5,"Working great for me, easy setup & better range than what it replaced.","It's rare when you find a sophisticated piece of equipment that just works. This one was easy to setup up (not through the wizard though, manual through browser was easier for me) & its working great. I've configed a few routers & wireless systems and setting up & using this one was a joy compared to the others."
1,Noncompatible!,"This router does not connect to my Zytel 600 series modem - a fact I found out the hard way since Amazon neglected to list compatibilities. The product manual is useless as is the Cisco-Linksys website. Their website is one of those nightmares written by the marketing guys, not their company techies.There is a workaround discussed on techie chatrooms which are not affiliated with Cisco-Linksys. But it involves rewriting some of the firmware on both boxes, which gets problematic when the phone company owns your modem. And when you can't connect the router to the internet to access OEM firmware updates for the router. So forget it. I'm sending mine back.Any Cisco-Linksys marketer reading this needs to know I consider failure to openly list known compatibility issues (in some obvious place like the box or the Amazon page) to be questionable practice. So I'm going to put Cisco-Linksys forever on the same s*** list occupied by such rising stars as Philips, Kia and Books-A-Million."
5,worked as expected,"I bought this along with a the asus 1000he netbook so I could get my internet to both computers. Setup wasn't too hard, even if this is my first taste of networking. you just need to know your IP address. I just copied all the previous settings from the network connections of the control panel. To change the settings after installation, type 192.168.1.1 into the address bar on your web browser. Linksys has the user manual available for download."
1,Bad installation wizard,Make sure you print user guides on installation from the web before you install this. If you have a problem (like I did ) when the wizard refused to connect my pc there was nothing in the box to assist. There is no help number or manual to assist. Basically you are on your own with this one. Not a user friendly router.
2,not so good,"After a long time using this router, I finally found out why the connection keeps falling....My cordless phone works in the same frequency (2,4ghz) as the router, they can't work together... so everytime the phone is used, I loose my wireless internet connection..."
1,no Adaptor,It takes 2 weeks to get it.very slowand there is no adaptor.I wish I can receive the adaptor as soon as possible.
2,Wrong choice,"I bought this after reading all of the great reviews. I had the WRT54G which got fried by a lightning strike in the yard and this seemed like a great replacement. It was easy to install and get running.The problem I had was that it just wouldn't sustain the connection. I'd work on my laptop for 5 minutes or so and it would drop the connection. I could reconnect in a few seconds but it was just such a hassle, so I returned it."
2,it didn't work,"I couldn't give a clear review for this product because it didn't work. I don't think it was the hardware itself, but rather the software DVD that should have installed it properly that was defective. It was easy enough to set up the unit, but the software didn't complete the installation and therefore it didn't connect to the internet. I returned the router and received a refund for the full purchase price."
4,Not fool proof but maybe the best,"I was so amazed on how well this router gets reception and how easy it is to setup security for the price range. Definately get this router. They have a new model out, but I would still go with this one, because I've heard a few bad things about the new ones. I've had two less popular brand routers in the past, and then I saw all the great reviews on this router. I am a beginner when it comes to routers, so I basically just use the basic settings to get it started. But with the software this router comes with, it is very easy to name your own network and set up a security code so your neighbors can't connect to your network. The range on this router is incredible. We have a two story house and I keep this at the upstairs computer. I can get near excellent reception in the basement which is about thirty feet below."
1,Cisco-Linksys WRT 54 GL,This model is only the first generation of wireless routers - there are many second and third generation models available from other manufacturers for about the same price and are much more sophisticated. The model I bought meets my minimum needs but I should have done more research before buying this one.
1,Difficult to insrall,Item came with a cd for installation . It was not informative very incomplete. Before we could get it to work it took numerous calls to tec lines and talking to a variety of people. They should include settings and explain how to find them . Their cd was not helpful and neither was their tec line.
2,Check on what this unit does not do.,"I am sending back - unopened - this unit because :1) if you would like to run 2 laptops wi-fi + internet blu-ray player and a wirless printer buy at least the E 2500 or better. This unit is 2.4 and 5.0 GHz, better firewall, speeds, guest codes, and more, for $30 more delivered.2) all the hype i read did not cover my problems of constantly having to unplug power several times per hour sometimes, on a identical -other than a few new whistles and bells- of the wrt54gl.3) this is my first return, I received the correct information from Cisco, and, i ordered it today - same price, delivered. Do not open the plastic if you do the same thing i did. I thought i would call Cisco without opening it. So, by the time i ship it back and get a credit or whatever, i'll have what i need up and running.4) shop smarter and don't be in a hurry. sure would love to talk with some informed people at Amazon - not holding my breath."
1,doesnt work with mac,"stay away from this cheap and old router, when comparing to other routers i found out that its slow and old.on top of that it doesnt work with macs, had to return and get a netgear"
1,No Access to Intranet - VISTA,"I tried everything but my laptop could not connect the internet. Maybe the problem was with the VISTA OS, but the company offered no fix."
2,Failed after a year,"It was a decent router that went south just after the warranty expired. The wifi failed and it no longer broadcasts a signal, leaving behind a wired router which is of limited use to me.When I bought it, I was lured by the linux capabilities but now Asus has the WL-520GU which can run Tomato and DD-WRT, has USB Printserver/NAS functionality, and is based on the newer Broadcom chipsets. Plus it's half the price after rebate.That's what I'm using as a replacement and I'd recommend it over Linksys because it has a more solid build quality and so far it hasn't left me high and dry.Don't be fooled by the Cisco name - there's nothing professional about a router that fails after a year."
4,DIFFICULTY WITH WORDS - DYSLEXIA,"Author Ann Farris feels inexplicable pain, confusion, a rushing in the body that confuse and isolate her. Told she is dyslexic and therefore handicapped, she resolves as an intelligent,successful professional to find out why.Dyslexia is defined as ""difficulty with words"". Confusion is not fun but mastering it is.Written in the first person and using drawings when words fail she sets out to heal herself, defining her dyslexia as ""alternative perception"". Ms Farris makes a good case, using and exploring diet, dreams, coloring games, senses, meditation, synesthesia, cleansing rituals, music, eye exercises, warmth, physical exercise, dance and chakras."
5,Great item - exactly what I was looking for,"This was a very hard to get item and was needed to go with the theme of my grandsons first birthday - A Caps For Sale Party - totally satisfied with price, service and item"
3,Admirable classic Ravenloft,"There are some pretty good stories here, riffs off of gothic fiction novels like Phantom of the Opera and a ripping good pirate yarn. My small complaint is the misleading cover which has a sort of Aztec motif and is not reflected in the stories presented therein. Wonderful interior art."
5,Purchase experience reminds me why amazon is the best,"Thank you Amazon. The first time I purchased this book , I did so from a third party on an outside text book website. I still haven't recieved the book. Its been two months. :(. Since then I have ordered from you and your vendors and recieved the book and person who it was intended for has read it. They also said it was one of the finest written autobiographies about someone from from the blues genre."
4,No problems,Don't know why this got average reviews because it worked like a charm for me while in Italy. Will use again for any overseas travels.
4,On the go,"Great gadget to have in your computer bag. Allows you to charge a computer, cellphone or Ipod no matter where you are in the world. Also has a fuse just in the event of a power surge. I used to travel with only plug adapters but ended up carrying 5 adapters."
3,USB should be integrated,"It wasn't clear to me when I looked at this online that you can't plug something in to the adapter, say a PC, and at the same time charge a USB. It's either/or. The two little end caps that swap out if you want to charge a USB or plug something in also have very flimsy plastic connectors that can break if not carefully packed, so I tend to bring only the plug adapter end. I saw a model in a Lufthansa in-flt magazine that had an integrated USB so you could charge both at once."
4,"A very, very good book","I really enjoyed this book. At over a thousand pages it offers plenty of detail. Written in 1965, it mainly covers Kennedy's policies (foreign and domestic) and avoids getting into any personal matters. It's a memoir, not a tell-all. My one complaint: Schlesinger's propensity to make Kennedy into a Saint. Any Kennedy error is almost always cast as him receiving bad advice, anything that turns out well is due to Kennedy's extreme intelligience. And Eisenhower is really mistreated in this book. All in all I highly recommend it!!"
1,I would call them Bread Crumbs not Crackers,"I ordered a case of these a few weeks ago and while they are made with cracker material they are not crackers they are a cross between bread crumbs and crutons. Not one cracker, in any of the boxes, are within ten percent of whole. They are all pulverized! There was no damage on the outer case, or any of the inners, but they look like they were either dropped from the 78th floor or tossed into the truck at 100 MPH. It's total loss. I would not chance it again."
5,Perfect Product,I bought this for my daughter and she and I love it so much. It's really thick and soft. Perfect texture for using a mouse one it. If you have a little girl who needs a mouse pad this is the perfect mouse pad. Great delivery speed to and in perfect conditon when it got here.
5,Good Overview of Pirates,A very well written overview of Pirates. This book has a lot of good pictures and drawings as well as very interesting details on the different types and eras of the pirates rise and fall. A good read.
3,Flat-footed performance,Completely lacking in dynamism.Bohm and Mehta do it better.Hard to make too many comparisons since these very early symphonies of Schubert are much less commonly recorded than the later ones.Mehta's reading of number 2 is a joy to listen to. 17 year old Schubert immortalized. 'Nuf said.
5,Simple isn't a four letter word!,"Simple doesn't have to be a bad thing.This is a great read and you don't have to move to Walden Pond to enjoy it. As all of the Idiots books you don't have to have any in depth knowledge on the subject to be able to take things from it.Its not about being deprived, its about values, what's important to you in life and what makes you happy.Simple doesn't mean being deprived.This book covers money, food and clthes and also community. There are choices to make. Do you want more stuff or do you want time to play. If you liked this book try the classic ""You're Money or your Life"" which takes their theories to a whole new level."
3,Great for beginners!,"The moves are easy to follow.I've been doing step for a while now, and I got bored with the simplicity of the moves. You definitely get a great workout, though! Recommended for people who are looking for a challenge, and are new to step."
5,GREAT!,"This video was awesome! Mine finally broke that came with the Step, and so I'm actually here buying another one. Anyway, I'm totally uncoordinated when it comes to following moves, but this one was a cinch and it doesn't get boring, either."
5,The Best Recording of Classical Spanish Guitar Music. Period,"This recording easily deserves 6 stars.Yepes was a consummate technician and a knowledgeable interpreter of all musical idioms from the Middle Ages through to the height of the 20th Century avant-garde. His playing was characterized by intelligence, sensibility, clarity, power, majesty, poetry, and a devilish ability to separate and sustain contrapuntal lines like no other guitarist could.This is one of his last recordings and one of his best. It opens with Yepes's majestic, evocative transcription of some of the ""Cantigas de Santa Maria"", music of surprising beauty and rhythmic complexity from the court of a 13th Century Spanish king. It continues with a selection of well-loved, mostly 19th and early 20th Century, Spanish music: works that will certainly appeal to a wider audience than the Baroque and Modern works for which Yepes was equally noted.Buy this CD; you will not regret it."
4,British Version is Better,"Like other reviewers, I don't like the fact that the USA gets an 'abridged' version. The 3rd series is complete and I ordered the 4th directly from the UK (I have a zone free DVD player worth the cost just to see the series the way it was shot)."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"IT SUCKS! WHAT A TOTAL EMBARASSMENT FOR THIS RECORDING. I FORGIVE THE SINGERS BUT NOT KARAJAN. KARAJAN MUST HAVE CONDUCTED THIS WHILE HAVING LUNCH. TEMPOS PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW. NO EXCITEMENT, NO FIRE, NO CONDUCTOR.WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?"
2,Overrated,"After reading reviews, I was ready for a fascinating book when I bought The Magician's Wife to take on a trip -- a trip when I knew I wouldn't be around an English language bookstore for a number of days, so it was important to take a book I'd thoroughly enjoy. I read & read, looking for depth and magic, unable to turn to anything else to read, and even in those circumstances, found nothing beyond shallow characters, fleetingly interesting physical descriptions and emotionless interchanges. Wonderful idea, disappointing execution. It was like watching a puppet show with beautiful puppets but no story, no sound. This was my first Moore book so I'll try others."
3,"An ""off"" book in the Moore repertoire","Set in North Africa in 1856, a magician is sent by Napolean III to Algeria to ""convince"" the fractious Bedouins that France has absolute power. To do this he creates contrivances, little devices that appear to give him magical powers. (One is a fake bullet made of wax with which he can be ""shot"" and not suffer any effects.) The Bedouins, however, have their own ""magician"" - a marabout, or holy man, and it comes down to a competition between opposing ""seers.""Although the book can be pretty suspenseful at times, the writing, especially the dialogue, is very stiff. This is surprising for Moore, who usually writes extremely well. It's as if the formal historical setting dictated he write in an almost stereotypically old-fashioned way - a big mistake. An amateur writer might be excused this failure, but not a pro like Moore."
1,"For abusive relationships only, very FEMINIST","This is a good book for those trying to extricate themselves from abusive relationships. While I do appreciate the author's point that the abuse is HIS problem, she fails to cover what to do when one extricates oneself. The fact is that if the abused does not seek help to change her coping mechanisms, she will repeat the relationship over and over again. She ALSO, must learn to change. The author blames society too much. Puts us in a victim role with respect to that. Just as it was HIS choice to batter, it was ultimately HER CHOICE to stay. This book was WAY off base where it attempted to address the families with substance abuse. I recommend this book only for women who are being physically battered."
2,This IS NOT the only book out there with this material,"The information is good, but I saw people complaining about the unnecessarily hefty price tag. I would recommend other practice building books like Kevin Doherty's Building Your Dream Practice, Burton Kent's Never Market Again or Brooke Thompson's online course Practice Abundance. I personally think the people over at Blue Poppy are full of themselves and don't care to give them my money."
3,More for TCM acupuncturists,"The information is a good overview of the business side of things. I haven't looked at the CD yet. However, it really is meant for TCM and not physician acupuncturists trying to integrate acupuncture into their business model. There are some good chapters though on workers compensation. Overall, the info was decent but the text is priced too high. I'd recommend finding a used copy if possible."
2,"As usual, the Emerson's just don't get it","Yes, they play very well, they are always in tune, and they can play as fast as they choose - but they don't understand the music. If you want a great version of these works, take a listen to the Hungarian Quartet on DG, or the Tokyo Quartet on RCA."

5,Just beautiful.,"My friend played me some Elliott Smith in his car, while we were riding. So...I became very curious about this artist, which I have never heard at the time. So the next day, I went out and purchased Elliot's unfinished album 'From A Basement On The Hill,' and immediately became a huge fan. Although, I have listened to Elliot's early works and did not like it that much, but I do love his later albums. Anywase, BUY THIS ALBUM...it's just beautiful."
2,Not working very well,"Instead of this Crimping Jaw I rather buy Crimping PlierThese 2 tools are not working very well, after strike few times with a hammer 2 notches on the tool almost come off ,and also you have a change to hit your finger with the hammer too, if you are not carefullySo if you can afford, then by the Crimping Plier don't buy these 2 small crimping jaws"
4,A Good Primer,A very good primer. Easy-to-read and well-written. Makes a complex subject fairly simple to understand and digest.
1,The Anton Chekhov Collection,"1. Love 1800s drama, but this was so slow, I haven't even finished it and I usually devour the BBC type of material."
4,"Agreat book, with a little history","Bought this book for my kids, as part of an Underground Railroad/Black History month project that we are doing. Didn't expect much out of it--but I started reading it myself, and didn't put it down until I'd finished. Verdi is an excellent writer and a great storyteller. Keeping in mind that this novel is aimed at the preteen set, I had goosebumps through one of the passages (his dream) and actually had started to wonder whether or not it would end in a way I wanted my younger kids (2nd and 4th grade) to hear. But yes, it is kid-friendly in the end, and in a good way that leaves the reader satisfied. In fact, the ending is the only mildly contrived part of the story and even that is told with a semi-smart-mouthed main character's wit that keeps it fun and in keeping with the book. There aren't easy, black-and-white, perfect characters here but believable kids and adults. And it's a great ghost tale!"
5,Adventurous and romantic story,"This is my first book by Cherry Adair, and I have to say that it pleasantly surprised me! I didn't know what to expect with this writer, but now I'm definitely gonna try to get my hands on other books written by Ms Adair!This story is full of adventure taking place in Montana and Alaska. There's a ton of action, romance, drama, suspense, and even a bit of comedy! At times, it can be a little hard for the squeamish, but it's definitely not gory like a horror story.I recommend this book to anyone who is a romantic and has a penchant for action and thrillers!"
2,Two Stars for DEREK only....,"Lily was all right, and Derek was described as fabulous, handsome, wealthy, charming and all the rest and he certainly was that, but the story was borING. It just dragged, which I found very annoying."
2,It's a pity...,"Although I fully agree to highly praising the interpreters I returned this compact disc because - despite otherwise superb sound quality and clarity - there are several technical flaws audible suggesting problems (too high input level) with the microphones during the recording. I even communicated with Deutsche Grammophon (Universal Music, Hannover) on this defect but unfortunately their answer (after having done some research on this) was that the defects are already on the digital tape and therefore would not disappear in any later reprint."
3,I Disagree,"Though this album includes several wonderful pieces of music from several great pianists, there are some glaring problems. There is a constant background 'white noise' that can be heard throughout each and every piece. Understood that this is likely from the date of the original recordings... but DG does have the ability to 'clean' the background noise as they have for dozens of other pieces.Most of these pieces, though performed by great artists, lack the full impact of their recordings on other albums. Even Fur Elise sounds limp, as if being played disagreeably and under protest! This is a good album to listen to once or twice, but I would recommend others for purchase.For piano works check out the albums by Rubinstein, Lang Lang, and Argerich (each of the three have different interpretations and everybody seems to prefer one of these three artists over the others; I myself enjoy Rubinstein).Just please don't purchase based on the collection of popular pieces, listen to it first!"
1,incorrect programme package,"the main problem with this software I believe, is that some of the packages have a limited version software in them. different to what is named on the label.which does not allow conversion from dvd to vdc.under trading standards law this is a serious offence, but since cosmi do not want to know, the best thing to do is to write it off to experience. although to be fair the software originally comes from pinnacle, and their support is also a waste of time.ps the cd copying is ok"
1,Spyware alert!,Do not buy this or any Cosmi or Starshine software. It installs Spyware on your computer and it will take an expert to get rid of it. Don't make the same mistake I did!
1,this stinks,I bought it and tried to rip a dvd.It didnt work. I kept trying and trying. Nothing worked. Idont recommend it.
5,It works,"We've used this for years and I can really tell when I have to go without it. I don't know why it ""calms"" but it sure does."
5,"great product, worth every penny","I've struggled with sleep and muscle tension for years and was introduced to this power powder by a great friend (thanks hil!) who said it worked for her. From day one, it's worked incredibly well. I don't feel drugged or sedated, just relaxed. I agree that it's pretty sweet and strong as far as flavor, but hey, I can deal! Careful: it does fizz up quite a bit and can easily overflow a glass if left unchecked. I'm really thankful to have this product as a natural alternative to the myriad of pharmacological sleep aids. No dependence, no withdrawal, just great, relaxed, restful sleep. Mazel tov, Natural Calm!!"
2,Not sure bottle was sealed,I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it.
5,Lifesaver,"I am an avid user of the NV Natural Calm because it has helped so much for my cramps. Rather than downing a lot of Tylenol or Advil, I just take the recommended dose of this with some warm water and I am set for several hours."
4,Can't sleep with out this,If i do not take this stuff at night i notice a difference. It helps me to fall asleep and stay asleep.
5,Natural Vitality/ Natural Calm,"Natural Vitality/Natural Calm is eas to take, easy and effective on the system . I am very satisfied with the product and will most definitely continue to use this product."
5,"Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure","I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff. I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out. Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem. But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called. Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day. It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night. I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss."
5,good stuff,"Great supplement. Nice and calming before bed, helps me sleep well, nice tangy taste. I buy it regularly and notice a difference when I go without."
5,Great Relaxer,"We have used Natural Calm for some time now, drinking it hot each night. Finding the item on Amazon makes it easier and less expensive to enjoy."
2,Okay,Towel is not thick enough. The logo looks like it was an iron on. It's good if you don't plan to use it.
5,"It's the Gimme Gimmes, what do you think?","I wasn't sure I would be totally into this since it was a live album, but it's way good! Delta Dawn, longest time and always on my mind are my favorites.I love this album, I work with folks with mental disabilties and I turned them into Gimme Gimme fans with this album. Whenever we get into my car they say 'Play that Delta Dawn band' haBut it's awesome, buy it!"
2,To Big,"This is suppose to be a womens watch. Yes we like things big in Texas but, this is to big. It is not made for a women."
4,Very Well done. Great cast,"Ray Winstone was great as always, as was Tamuera Morrison. Beautiful country, good story, great cast. Very under-rated film and a must see."
4,Flasket Brinner - 'Flasket' (Mellotronen),"Double-length album, initially released in 1972 - by this Swedish 'eclectic' melodic rock short-lived two-lp band. Maybe not my favorite genre - but basically, this is just all-around good music. Here on 'Flasket, you get ten studio tracks + six live songs that possess a blues feel (more so than one may expect from Flasket Brinner, anyway). Tunes I liked best were ""Klotet"", ""Anderssons Groove"", the ten-minute well-played ""Grismakt"" and the jazzy ""Bosses Lat"". Might draw in fans [I'm second guessing] of King Crimson, Collosseum, Wishbone Ash and possibly Trad Gras & Stenar."
4,"Cook with help from JR, Stone Cold and Wrestling Superstars","You'll enjoy this cookbook, especially if you are a wrestling fan. I made Edge's Spareribs (very easy recipe for spaz's like me in the kitchen). And there is a little of everything from appetizers, main meals, to deserts and beverages. It's my main cookbook besides my Pillsbury Cookbook (check that one out too). Your next barbeque will be a hit thanks to JR. (Hey is he a Ewing?)"
4,"Not a bad cookbook, for WWF fans","Great cookbook! Not only are recipes featured from virtually the entire WWF roster of the year 2000, but also from the workers that work ""behind the scenes"".Let me tell you that there's nothing wrong with the recipes featured.The only problem with it is that, the pictures are in monochrome! (a bit of glossy color images might have brighten the inside up a bit!)Also most hardcore (like me!) WWF fans, who may buy this book (but not at really interested in cookery) may be looking for color photos or something a bit extra special that you don't get in all other/conventional cookbooks. However, nothing special (bar the unique gimmick recipes) is there from them.4 out of 5 Stars"
2,Not Impressed,"Over the past few years, I've begun transitioning all of my reels to fluorocarbon. I bought a spool of this line in 6-lb test to compare against Berkley Vanish and Stren brand. Upon spooling my reels, I found it to be every bit of 8-lb mono diameter, possibly 10. It was very, very thick as compared to the other brands of 6-lb fluorocarbon. I realize this line isn't pure fluorocarbon, however, I can do without the added diameter. I also found this line to have high memory compared to the other brands."
3,"High quality print, colorful and durable","This is an excellent map for travel between major cities, but if you want detail of particular cities: Santo Domingo outside of the touristy Zona Coloniál or say, Higüey or San Pedro de Macorís, forget it. It is a detailed account of the Dominican highway system, but not the map for in-town travel. To its credit, it does have limited street maps of the tourist central cities of Santo Domingo & Puerto Plata, but not of the business / industrial centers of Santiago de los 30 Caballeros, Higüey, La Romana, San Pedro de Macorís, etc."
3,"Great size, but quality is lacking",I was a bit dissapointed when we recieved these and some other sets of learning resources Jumbo animals. I expected them to be more on the thick rubbery side of plastic rather than just plastic melted together. And of course with all the lead paint scare I wonder about the paint on these??? Other wise my daughter is happy with them and likes to play with them.
5,great cardio with great stress reduction,"My mom had this tape and wore it out so she had to buy another one.This is split up into three parts.20 minutes of fat burning aerobics,20 minutes of relaxing stetch,and the 10 minutes of it is a stress reduction sequence as you lay down and close your eyes when jane talks all the stress out of you.This is a great tape to do on days when I am stressed out to the max or having cramping and muscle pains.This tape burns fat with fun easy to follow aerobics.Improve flexibility and makes you feel great with the stretches.The stress reduction is a great way to end the workout.This tape is a must have for people who are beginning an exercise program and who are stressed out.If you like this you will definately like Jane Fonda`s Yoga."
2,Embarassed,"My mom quite smoking so I thought I would fill a gift bag with items to ""reduce stress"" besides smoking. So I saw this video and bought it. I didn't realize that people my parents age hate Jane Fonda for what she did to those poor soldiers in the war. I was so embarrassed. My mom has never watched this and neither have I."
2,very poor display,"I love Freecell, and wanted a handheld version to take with me. Unfortunately, not seeing one in any store before buying it on line was a mistake; I would have never purchased this one if I had. The layout on the screen makes it extremely difficult to see the suit cards or entire rows/lines of cards, and since the game came with no instructions (other than for the battery) I have yet to figure out how to scroll up and down to see what is where. Very disappointed in this one!"
3,Freecell,"Better than the older version, but the screen is very hard to see when there is lots of light. Best in a darkened room."
2,Not the easiest way to play FreeCell,"I don't like that there isn't any way to see the whole game, only what fits on the screen. I also don't like having to use a stylus."
2,Free Cell Handheld,"As an owner of three worn out Radica FreeCell handheld games, I was disappointed in the Bicycle Touch Screen FreeCell. It is not very responsive to stylus taps, more difficult to scroll up and down, and no where near as handy to play as the no longer manufactured Radica.Nevertheless, it is better than no FreeCell!"
2,lumpy fructose without expiration date,"Although the flavor was great, the claim that this ""mixes instantly"" isn't true. The can also says ""for best results: gently stir, do not use blender"". I stirred, stirred, and stirred--it is still lumpy. What is ironic is that I don't usually even mind lumps, but this went beyond. Pea-sized glopp--. Also, the 2nd ingredient is fructose, 3rd cookies, 4th fructose. Was this to avoid fructose being the 1st ingredient? It does taste good, and did not create a sugar-buzz, on the good side. I did like the quality guarntee from the independent lab. I didn't like the lack of an expiration date on the can. I would highly recommend Shaklee products instead (no I don't sell them)."
1,Buyer Beware...,"I am a dedicated Target fan, BUT this almost ruined it for me. I ordered this CD player, and when it arrived it worked for all of 1 hour. Then the volume didn't work. It went from blasting loud to super soft. I just thought it was one in a million, so I ordered a replacement. Guess what...Volume didn't work on this one either."
2,The mounting plate is NOT universal,"The product description is false. The mounting plate is not universal--it has a bolting pattern of 3.5"" W x 2.5"" H. That's kind of important."
1,"Please, Mr. Kivel, stay away from my son","I'm steering a middle course between the extremes representedhere.I don't hold with the 'you have to fight to be a man' school,but I'm certainly not on board with Kivel's ""there are no inherent differences between boys and girls, only societally programmed differences."" I managed to get through the book with difficulty; his obvious distaste for any school of thought which presupposes some behaviors as innately masculine stuck in my throat.I was a boy, my son is a boy - he's not the way I was at his age, and that's fine by me. He likes to run and yell and make messes - but he also likes chess and math and playing the saxophone. I don't try to smother his behaviors based on whether or not they meet a predetermined template - either Iron John's or Mr. Kivel's. The curious thing is, Kivel is just as dogmatic about what constitutes 'acceptable' behavior as James Dobson - a comparison which would no doubt dismay both men."
2,"Funny, but disappointing","I really wanted to like this one. And, like some of the other reviews mention, it is funny at first. In fact, the first half-hour is hilarious. However, once the unintentional comedy begins to die off, all you are left with is bad acting, bad writing, bad CGI. The main reason I even gave this one two stars is because I absolutely love this kind of stuff. I love cheese movies like Silent Venom, Dinocroc, Snakehead Terror, etc. This one, though, really just bored me. It really seemed like it was taking off at first. The piranha were growing exponentially, doubling in size every 36 hours. Cool idea. But, like I said, after that first half hour the filmmakers goof it up. No more really funny stuff, no good gore, just a by-the-numbers race-against-time that fails to thrill or induce chuckles. A fun idea that never reaches its full potential. Not even close."
1,Keep Looking,"I purchsed this clock from another source a couple of months ago. The first set of new alkaline batteries were dead inside a month. The second set of freshly charged NiMH were gone inside two weeks. Last week, even fresh batteries would not get the clock to work. When it did work, the LCD could not be read when laying in bed and the clock was on the nightstand. To be able to read the time you had to first pick up the clock and tip it.I'm writing this review while looking for a replacement."
2,Far from ideal,"As noted elsewhere, has a very limited viewing angle--digits can't be read from other than pretty much dead-on.And the LED display crapped out after about six months, making it impossible to distinguish a ""3"" from an ""8,"" for example.There must be a better offering on the market."
1,Another hour of my life,"I have just spent another hour of my life trying to reset this clock for daylight savings time. (Yes... I read and re-read the instructions.) My office is where I use this clock and it will not receive a signal here. I took the clock home with me last night so it could ""reset"" automatically. It did not. It never has. I spent the last hour trying to reset the clock manually. It beeped, it went blank, it reset to factory settings but it never would let me set the time manually. My fingers are actually sore.The clock alarm is not as advertised and the temp never matches either of the other temps in my area. It is always sitting around 74 even when the ranges registered around me are between 64 and 84.The clock is now in my tash can. I wouldn't recommend you buy this clock. Spend a bit more money and get something that works... all the time."
5,The best in literature and rhythm,"I've never enjoyed poetry like this before! The Dead Poets offer a fun, toe-tapping take on classical literature that would make Emily Dickenson hide behind her chair. (Like in Emily Dee, where they let us know that every Emily Dickenson song can be sung to The Yellow Rose of Texas!) They weave the classics into modern lyrics in some songs (check out the sample of Crocidile Tears, which does Lewis Carroll proud). In other songs, they simply let the poetry stand alone, complemented perfectly by their melodies (Funeral Blues, by Auden). I've never seen another CD that can be enjoyed so much by both kids and adults. From the hilarious to the profound, these three guys' melodies will have you singing and dancing, crying and laughing from start to finish."
5,A very helpful book,"I found the book was very helpful. I am thinking of buying a horse. I had no idea how to take care of the horse. I have been taking riding lessons for some time ,but never shown how to groom or tack up the horse. I found this book very helpful."
4,"An inspiring analysis of ""The Boss'"" significance","Mr. Cullen has done an often inspiring job of revealing the layers of depth beneath the iconic surface of this fascinating ""pop star."" Avid Springsteen fans like myself will probably find invaluable historical cords in Cullen's analysis that link the singer to a ""republican"" tradition in this country that probably represents the best practical legacy America has to offer the world. It's a rewarding surprise to find Springsteen's work paralelled with, say, a Whitman verse. Nevertheless, Cullen is also careful to avoid over-inflating his subject's importance, even while placing him alongside Emerson, Twain, Martin Luther King, and Elvis. The author's conclusion is brilliantly simple and clear despite the wide scope he brings to Springsteen's themes: Springsteen's work, like that of those other cultural luminaries, is a rich and rewarding tributary of the most enlightened stream of our culture."
5,More irrefutable evidence that evolution is real,An outstanding choice for anyone who is curious who we are and where we come from. This is a very well presented documentary that presents the overwhelming evidence of our origins. They do a really good job of showing how they test hypotheses with empirical evidence and laboratory procedures. In this outstanding presentation they show how (DNA) genetic conservation also very strongly supports the theory of our origins.Becoming Human [Blu-ray]
5,In The Company of Heroes,Excellent read! I saw Mike Durant at a Leadership conference and reading the book was as if he was standing on stage and talking about his ordeal.
5,Honest and Compelling,"Blackhawk Down, the book by Mark Bowden, was almost impossible to put down and this book is no different. But if you read Blackhawk Down, then you haven't read the whole story until you've seen Michael Durant's book. It's a pleasure to read. It's also refreshing to see an author who isn't trying to smear or damage those with whom he worked. On the contrary, Michael Durant does a noble job of telling the true story without attacking any specific person. NSDQ."
4,Extremely useful for me,"I had never constructed or decorated a multilayer cake before reading this book. The first several pages of this book showed me the basics of how to do it. (After watching Food Network heavily for a year, I never saw these basics there.) The book is easy to read and follow. I have tried several recipes from the book, and they have always been big hits at the parties to which I have taken them."
4,"They're not cakes, they're works of art!","This is a good cookbook for those wanting to experiment with new and fun cake designs. The book gives readers a helpful tutorial on how to assemble and frost a cake, and then delves into many different cake projects, each with it's own theme, like a summertime theme or the birthday cake pictured on the cover. There are several multi-tiered cake projects included, but I stuck to the single-layer ones. It also includes patterns to follow for icing decorations. The end product is very nice and people will likely be impressed with your baking skills."
4,Enjoyed but not overwhelmed,"I enjoyed this book but expected a slightly higher quality of cake produced. They are really into vibrant colors and give a lot of helpful hints about that but the cakes themselves were only okay, nothing earthshakingly different or unique. They give tons of advice from beginning to end for creating a cake, this is especially good for a person new to decorating."
1,pronunciation,"While visiting friends in Belarus, they informed me that the examples for pronouncing some Byelorussian words is incorrect."
2,Not helpful for academic reading,"This dictionary might be fine for tourists, but I bought it to try to read entries from a Belarusian archaeological encyclopedia. None of the words I need help with are in the dictionary. The dictionary doesn't give any information on figuring out the Russian equivalents of Belarusian spelling, either, so there's no way for me to use it to look the Belarusian words up in a Russian dictionary. I wish someone would publish a Belarusian dictionary suitable for English-speakers who are trying to read old Belarusian documents and books about Belarusian history."
3,Tedious at Best,"Couldn't hold my interest. Typical of a good wordsmith who is preoccupied with his own mind. He lived inside his own head where he played and suffered. I realize he committed suicide, someone should have helped him open the door to his own interior preoccupation so he could come out and play. Easier said than done, I know, but reading his mental wanderings is exhausting."
2,Infinitessimal macrocosm (sic),"""Post-modernism"" is a reference to literature which has been produced after the discovery and artistic representation of strands of DNA (pertinent). Thymonucleic acid tends towards the form of a helix in construction. (There's a peculiar concept beneath ""helix"" in your dictionary, coincidentally). Mr. Wallace would construct a genetic novel, as it were. Splicing and replacing your information, that he does. He says, ""Take up your cross and follow me, and thou shalt inherit infinite jest."""
5,worth the time & the effort,This book is an unflinching examination of human nature and American culture. Wallace works on so many levels simultaneously that one could probably read this novel a thousand times and still make new discoveries. Reading it has been an amazing experience. Thank you Dave Wallace.
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"I pick up on this book when Wallace's editor recently published a book that he had left unfinished. The reviews sounded interesting and made Wallace sound like some one I wanted to read. The book is about addiction. You almost need to be an addict to appreciate it. It digs deep into the 12 step program and occasionally throughout the book has insightful asides (sort of like Meville describing very species of whale). But it is a poor read the story does not flow. I was more than 1/4 of the way thru before it made any sense. And then at the end it just stops, does not tie the stories together in any way.As you can tell from my title I find the hype on this book pretentious. It is a long slogging read find something else."
5,A grand splendid messy book,"I have read this novel three times, and have never failed to be moved and entertained. Yes, it can be difficult, and yes, even irritating. But there are giant sections of this giant novel that are as deeply moving and riotously funny as anything I have ever read."
5,In the top five of all-time,"Infinite Jest contains so much life, humor, zest, despair, and just plain oddness it leaves you breathless trying to recommend it to a friend. It's hard work, sure. But it's ever so worth it. Vaults to the top with Lolita, Gravity's Rainbow (or maybe Mason & Dixon), Brothers Karamazov, and Light in August. A masterpiece. (So where does DFW go from here...?)"
1,snooze snooze snooze,"To compare this book to Pynchon (among others) does Pynchon a great diservice. At least Pynchon, has humor, literary references, etc. With this book you get 300 pages of sob story amatuer tennis stories and a few paragraphs of interesting subjects. My advice to Mr. Wallace cut the semi-autobiographical tennis crap (no body wants to hear it anyway) and write a good story."
2,Sometimes a dysfunctional experience,"This was like driving across the US w/out cruise control, or better yet reading a long passage without a period in sight. Sure there were some neat things to see along the journey, with the whole time thoughts of finally getting to the coast and a big payoff. Dear DFW, you asked a lot of your readers and all we wanted was a worthwhile reading experience; we appreciate your literary prowess and excused your show-off nature, if only you thought about your reader. I'm big fan of your essays; perhaps it's condensing your focus that's what I like and find very readable. There's a lot of glowing reviews, sorry I just don't get it...reader be aware."
2,Infinite Text,"If brevity is the soul of wit, is this the infinity of a soulless twit?Here's a suggestion: read 4 truly great books instead of one barely interesting prolix ramble.Screw the two stars, I want one back. This gets one star only."
2,Infinite Bust,"I purchased the book with high hopes. Not reading any reviews to spoil it, I just went about the book like a mad woman that I am trying to identify with the message. I skipped through the pages trying to find a hook. Something other than visual trickery to sustain my lack of focus and inattentiveness but then again when I think about it, maybe that was the whole point. Someone like me could never relate to someone like that."
1,one of the worst books I have ever read,"This was one of the two worst books I've ever read in my life. I had hoped it might be like ""Foucault's Pendulum"" by Umberto Eco (a book I like), as some friend suggested. But it bore no similarity at all, except in being dense, long, and somewhat difficult to follow.I found ""Infinite Jest"" to be plotless, self-absorbed, and wallowing in pointless cruelty and hideousness. It gave me a clear image of the author as being arrogant and self-congratulatory, and completely lacking in any kind of moral or ethical center.Life is just too short to waste on stuff like this. I only wish I could get back the time I spent reading this horrible book. I stuck with it all the way to the end hoping for some sort of payoff, something that would tie it all up and make the experience worth it, but there was nothing. It just ended."
5,amazingly thougtful and insightful,"IJ is probably the best piece of fiction written in the ninties. Challenging but worth the effort, the storytelling itself underlines one of the subtle premises of the book; namely that Americans have had their attention spans burned out due to the instant gratification of television and other modern entertainment. This story will grip you by the throat and force you to think more deeply about what it means to be a tv-adled American. The dedication it takes to stick the story out to the end and grasp all the varied threads as they coalesce is well worth the effort. A superbly crafted work that stimulates and challenges even the most jaded reader. Don't skip the footnotes!"
3,To Dazzle and Dizzy,"Wallace's language (voice) is breath-taking, awe-inspiring, and wrenchingly self-conscious. I am impressed, and cannot help but think that that was Wallace's intention all along. The book is a whir of dizzying perspectives, exotic vocabulary and, well, gargantuan (a trophy for coffeetables around the globe). Certainly worth reading, and telling everyone within a fifty-mile radius that you've done so. At the end, though, this massive novel does not succeed in forming a new perspective within the reader, an outlook that the reader carries with her/him after the back cover is slammed shut.That said, when the ugly demon of self-consciousness does not raise his pointed head within this novel, the writing is extraordinary and, in places, profound. If only the sparse profundity could have been amplified and distended, this could very well have been one of the greatest novels in American literature."
2,"D.F.W., F.D.R. F.D.R., D.F.W.","Prose dies now, as supposed ""Great Novel,"" book with pages numbered with zeroes three, subtext of notes with feet, many of: boredoms, longish sentences, plots plodding slowish, andandandndndndndnd: who cares? Pick ye up Mr Jamesish Joyce or Thomish Pynchon for longly novels, or mastery, or fun fun fun.F.D.R. & things dead are inspiration, source of push for D.F.W."
1,How could somebody enjoy this book?,"I'm sorry, but I just don't understand how my fellow Amazon reviewers could have scored this book highly.The first chapter sets up a potentially enthralling narative style, and the concept of a TV show that gives viewers infinite bliss (so much so that they ignore things like eating and living) is great. However, it's all downhill from there.The book seems to spend forever talking about tennis and drugs, without particularly wanting to tell a story. If this is the perfect example of a 'contemporary' story, then I'll stick with the classics.Don't say you haven't been warned!"
1,i thought i might love this book,"I had always avoided this book in graduate school. I suspected it was written by an intellectual who was overstuffed, yet cool and who probably used a lot of big words and deep concepts while still being a very dry writer. A lot of people who were reading what they were supposed to read had this book in their hand and that also made me suspicious that I would find it very boring.And so I never read it.Until I saw that it was about tennis, and I love tennis. So I thought I will pick it up on amazon for cheap.I wish I had thumbed through it at a bookstore before I had done this.It was exactly what my first impression is. I was two pages in and started to feel confused, zoned out, and lost. I must not be very smart and I am not ashamed to say it.This book is either terrible or way too heavy for me.Either way, I wish I could give it no star."
3,Kindle version quite convenient for footnotes,"I thought the book was pretty much a mess, it was all over the map. You really could toss the pages in the air and, except for a few story lines that actually progress through the book, you could shuffle the pages back together in random order and the result would be equally as coherent as currently written. Other reviewers are correct in saying some parts of the book are engaging and others boring, if not downright unnecessary.I have the print and Kindle edition. I have to say, the Kindle edition is superior because the story has more than 300 footnotes and all are hyperlinked in the text, so clicking back and forth from the text to the footnote and then back to the story is easy. In the print version, you have to flip pages to the end of the book then find your place again. Not to sound lazy..."
1,Too weird,"I tried, but I just couldn't get into this story at all. It makes Twin Peaks look straightforward and simple, but wihtout any of the charm and quirkiness of that show. I regret buying"
2,Maybe I am missing the point....,"But I have no idea what this book is about. I feel like I am reading a book written by someone with a large vocabulary who's trying to use all his big words. This is a cumbersome book, literally and figuratively. I have no idea what is going on!! Save your money and go look in the bargin area for some good books!"
4,"Adorable Fill-In, just a tad smallish",I love the cute vintage look of this book. It is just a tad on the small side for holding the memorabilia that I was looking to include. Ultimately went with another book for that reason only.
2,Not quite what I expected,"Make sure to note the size of this baby book before you buy it... it is very small...just barely wide enough to paste a picture in. The illustrations are cute, but there were some pages with which I wasn't too thrilled. The arrival of the baby page has the baby falling out of a top hat with stars like some magic trick and there are playing cards decorating the page. I returned it and will look for another..."
2,"OK, considering no other unsalted options","Trying to cut back on sodium, yet being a sunflower seed junkie, I thought I'd give these a try. They took some getting used to at first, but I warmed up to them rather quickly. The size of the seeds are a bit much (they can make your jaw hurt after awhile if you have to turn them upright to crack inside your mouth). I pretty much mowed through 4 of the canisters, thinking that I would probably order some more before I ran out. However, after getting most of the way through the 5th one, I poured some seeds into my hand, along with a weevil. I was disgusted by the possiblity that I might've eaten one or some already without even knowing. I then looked in the bottom of the sixth container and saw a weevil in it as well. In all the many years I've been eating sunflower seeds from David or Frito Lay, etc., I've never, not once, encountered this. I would not buy these again!"
5,You won't find these hotels in any travel guide,"Much has been written about luxury hotels, but Paul Groth has chosen an overlooked subject: the bottom-rung hotels, often known as SROs (single-room occupancy), that serve as homes for those at the margins of society. Groth is an architecture professor who has actually lived in such places, which gives a refreshing personal touch to the book. He discusses the physical characteristics of such buildings, combined with a sympathetic description of who lives in them and what their lives are like. At the end of the book, Groth argues that SRO residents have been overlooked in urban renewal, and he explains how naive it is to expect that demolition of SROs will cause their residents to disappear.The book has a distinct San Francisco emphasis. There are over 150 illustrations, mostly photos, but also including 12 floor plans. If you've ever wondered about the down-and-out hotels that are in every town and city, Paul Groth explains what is behind the facades."
2,Not funny,"The first Harold and Kumar film was funny and uplifting. I enjoyed it very much and recommended it to friends. This sequel is mean spirited and just plain not funny. It's not even stupid funny. Many scenes lead nowhere. It doesn't even approach clever or creative. A good film you can watch many times and enjoy it. This film was a slog to watch even once. These two make a great comic pair, I would like to see them togeather again, in a worthy script. I was disappointed."
1,Very disappointing,"I really enjoyed the first Harold and Kumar movie. This one was a complete disappointment. Filthy, vile, disgusting -- moronic at best. I very much like Kal Penn as an actor (esp. in ""the Namesake""). He has already made a name for himself and has a bright future. I have no idea why he would agree to do a movie like this. I now have zero regard for him as an actor."
1,"This Ain't White Castle: Greasy, Empty Calories","A four year hiatus from the almost-cult classic status of H and K Go to White Castle was not long enough to pull off this sophmoric film.In a desperate attempt to appeal to young males as its target audience, it features grossness-- such as explosive diaherra, killing Bambi, inbreeding, and gratutious, bottomless (as opposed to topless) parties-- in place of humor. White Castle made us laugh as it took us on the road to nerdiness,kindness,impossible situations and improbable coolness. In this film, all of that is replaced by prison rape, dopers and a sadistic Dougy Hooser. Where did they ever get the idea that misogyny was funny?It was not successful at the box office. It won't be any funnier in your living room. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,harold and kumar,this movie seems to be made for the world were they joke about red necks butt not the other type of people. i guess if your not white you may like it it has it great moment and few sexy ladys butt im getting sick of the low blows to red necks and white people.
3,not half as good as the first one,Although I love the Harold and Kumar movies I was rather disappointed in this one. I wqs expecting it to be as funny if not better than the first one and it surely wasn't. It was silly and not that funny.
1,does not work because of all the scratches,they inside of the dvd case on BOTH dvds was broken and didnt hold the dvds in place. they are both covered in scratch and barely play. might as well be garbage.
5,Hilarious,"this movie is hilarious through out. definitely alot more raunchy than the first one but so many funny moments in this movie keep it good from start to finish. the racial jokes are also very funny, messed up but hey oh well. every comedy is aiming towards racist jokes. recommend this to any body who liked the first one"
1,A Waste of Money,"This book was a total waste of money for the price. The information is useless on a practical level. There is no information concerning ""real"" lost treasures. The only one earning treasure from the book is the author. If this book sold for $8.95 I MIGHT not feel so ripped off. The price is absolutely exorbitant!"
3,Strong On Melody,"I believe Mel's strengths really shine in her ability to create pleasing, memorable melodies. The ballads here, such as Connected and Fences, are equally as impressive lyrically - one beautifully simplistic, the other a remarkable adaption. With a growing demand for this kind of music among spiritual devotees, I would recommend this work for choirs, gatherings, services, etc."
2,Difficult to use,"This travel guide was very hard to use...maps were cut up into parts, and further they could not be enlarged so were pretty useless. It was not possible to search on a particular topic. General history was interesting, but local information was not very good, except if you were looking for entertainment and eateries.We were very disappointed because we have used print versions of other Lonely Planet guides successfully."
4,"Not as hot as Tom of Finland, but good....","I enjoyed the pictures, not as graphic as Tom of Finland, but good. Worth adding to any collection"
4,Nice backpack .,"This is a nice backpack . I like the single large compartment and love the lumbar cushioning . So far so good . The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the price and it doesn't have a center strap . Other than that , it'll work . I'll update after a couple of weeks ."
2,stay away unless in cold weather,"i am hoping i can still return this product. while it is full of features as advertised, looks are not impressive, and the rubber part in the design begin to melt out in the heat, and when stored even a short while, the rubber begin to attract kinda (white) fungus patches which need cleaning, but same time reflect poor thought by designers to incorporate poor quality material. so stay away, if are travelling anywhere in summer time weather..."
1,"Total junk; cheaply made, fell apart within a month","I bought one of these bags during a sale at our college bookstore. My faithful REI backpack, which lasted me nearly ten years, is finally developing zipper problems and so when I saw this bag for $20, I figured it was a good replacement for my current pack.Unfortunately, this backpack went to pieces pretty quickly. In particular, the straps on both sides began to fray badly at the lower joint, within a month of purchase. I haven't done anything with this bag but carry books in it, but it's literally coming apart at the seams. My old REI pack, on the other hand, is still in pretty decent condition despite having been used on camping trips as well as for school.On top of everything else, the bookstore refused to give me a refund since this was a clearance item... so I'm out twenty bucks and I need a new backpack again. Now I know why they had extras left over. Buyer beware."
2,Disappointing,"After anxiously waiting for this book, I began to study it, and was very disappointed. Chess Tactics for the Tournament player is a disappointing book.The themes presented in the chapters are in no logical order! They are just randomly slapped there for you to study.As another reviewer mentioned, the commentary in this book is very sparse. Sometimes they give examples to easy for the intended audiences (1 or 2 move combinations) and then give very difficult ones right after it (6 or 7 move combinations).Thye book crams many themes, sometimes 3 or 4, in one chapter. At the end of the chapter, they only give 12 excercises! How are you suppose to learn this stuff if they give an average of 3 excercises per theme?!Overall, I was disappointed.I own Just the Facts!, the 7th volume in this series, which is very good. If only the authors mirrored the style in that book with this one.I ordered the king in Jeopardy, the 4th volume of this course. Hopefully it will be better than this one."
4,LUFKIN TAPE,I recently purchased this tape for work. My last lufkin tape had a large handle. This works much better & is easier to carry. I am an appraiser & used it everyday.
5,Wonderful Product,"This reader is great!! It treats each flash card as its own drive and is very fast!! You can use it to move files from one card to another. Yes!!!! It is backwards compatible with usb 1.1 . I have Windows XP and it will warn you that you are using a high speed device in a low speed port, but you can close the message and it works perfectly fine. ( Just slower than the 2.0 port). It's real convenient having a 6 in 1 card reader thats fast and fits in your pocket."
4,Good but not perfect,"I had been looking for a MP3 player that was inexpensive, had plenty of storage space, and used AA or AAA batteries. The T10 filled all of this and I found it on sale. The interface is fairly easy to use though not the easiest to change folders while running or fast walking. That is not a major issue for me but it might be someone else that likes to use lots of folders to store their groups/genres of music. Another issue was getting used to the rounded back. It doesn't sit flat against your body when it hangs from the included lanyard. I wish they would have included an armband holder in addition or instead of the lanyard. Overall I have been pleased with my purchase and the battery life of a AA is superb."
3,Comparison with IFP899,"Big disappointment!!! The previous version of this player by iriver (IFP 899, 1GB) sound is MUCH superior. Why??? I read somewhere that they switched from PHillips to Samsung chip, whatever the reason the result is really a step back and not forward. I was suprised that this is only $150, but now I see how it because so cheap in price (by going cheap in quaility). I bought T10 for my daughter, but was planning to buy it for myself if I liked it, but definitely sticking to my old IFP iriver (which I would definitely rate as 5 star). Plus: More storage space, compatible with audible, Minus: Noticable drop in sound quality from the previous version."
2,Not her best work,"I am a big fan of Ms. Buck's work. I read and loved 'Pavilion of Women', 'Imperial Woman', and 'Peony', but this book was lacking. There were just too many things left unexplained. Her husband's disappearance seems more of a cheap plot point than a real plot device. The death of her daughter felt again like a cheap plot point, and her son's death... ehh. I enjoyed this book at first, but as it went on, the story didn't feel as coherent as it had before. Sorry to say, but this isn't the best of Ms. Buck's stories. I guess you can't win them all."
4,Interesting but not as profound as I'd hoped,"The book was fine, I found the articles interesting but some of them were not as thought-provoking as I'd hoped they'd be. I bought it as a gift for a friend and decided to read it first. Some of the chapters just sounded like they were written by academics with too much time on their hands or grad students making a first attempt . . . a lot of analysis without any really profound conclusions that I wouldn't have drawn on my own. The more interesting ones were ""Tony Soprano as ethical manager"" and ""The Sopranos and subjectivist ethics."""
1,The most horrible movie I've seen!,"I recently viewed this movie, and I have to say that it has few or no redeeming qualities.I chose this video because it was in German, and because it was rated with 3 1/2 stars, but this was very misleading.The violence in the movie was senseless, perpetrated by a couple of sick, demented men who had a taste for playing with people's minds and emotions, and who had no value for life.The couple of times that it seemed that the movie could take a turn for the better, it left the viewer disappointed.The movie dragged at times when there was no action, no music, and no dialog.Definitely not worth seeing!"
4,Jerry Bruckheimer Production this ain't,"A family goes to their remote vacation house and is visited by two seemingly harmless boys. Unfunny games ensue. Haneke likes to provoke, and this movie is no exception to that rule. He has some very interesting ideas about onscreen violence, and how the audience likes to participate and interact with it.This is definitely a movie to watch with several other people.I watched it with some friends and there were moments where everyone would applaud or squirm or groan in boredom in unison, but if you're like me, and you like to observe the reactions of your friends to movie scenes, you'll enjoy the effects of Funny Games.Of all of Haneke's films, I like this one the best, because you can atleast identify with someone, even if it's the doomed protagonists.4 stars doesn't mean you'll want to watch the movie more than once. So perhaps you don't want to buy it, but it's definitely a movie that once you see it once, you'll know whether or not it's one to buy."
4,"Perplexed by dismissive ""art-house"" pigeonholers","I guess if you live in the city of cities, or even in the ""un-city"", New Orleans, you've seen enough ""European"" cinema to be able to dismiss something pretty authoritatively. Whatever. Maybe you had a talkative date or a Monday morning business plan that needed writing--something must have been directing your attention away from this whirlpool of suspense. Yeah, we all knew as soon as we heard Zorn's Naked City over the opening credits that it was going to end violently--that wasn't the hard part. The hard part was who was going to do what to whom. Just like always, it's the nuances that pull you in or leave you waiting for the next Central Station."
2,an okay movie,"i thought that the story was excellent, kinda missed up, but the movie was in german and had no english dubbing wich made it boring for me. i like to watch my movies not read them. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you don't watch it, unless you like readding your movies."
3,Pretty good film.,"I've watched Funny Games a handful of times. I'm not a big fan of it, but there's no doubt that it's quite different. The plot deals with a family that takes a trip to their lakeside house for some respite. From there they meet a couple of young guys and trouble begins. This is quite an intense psychological film that doesn't hold back. The acting by everyone involved is good. I don't consider Funny Games to be a great film, but it's still satisfactory and worth a watch."
4,great book,"for a just-above-elementary learner like me, getting started learning Hanzi, this is a wonderful book! five more words needed for review"
2,Over 15 Minutes and No Relief,"This book falls short of its promises. I have followed the core and weight-lifting programs for two months & continue to suffer the same wrist/finger pain I had when I started. Based on the reviews here as well as the author's claims, I would have expected relief by now. Second, I have yet to do the core or weight-lifting programs in 15 minutes--both claims the author makes. Lack of exercise alternatives for weight machines is also a complaint.On the positive side, I have gotten more limber and certainly stronger due to following this program. I have also learned that some of the exercises I was doing may have caused more problems.All in all, I think there are better books out there focusing on Pilates/yoga or weight lifting that are more flexible. Their programs may not take 15 minutes, but neither does this."
5,The Core Program,"As an orthopedic physical therapist, I found Peggy Brill's program to be sound and complete.Most importantly, focus is paid to balancing the body's muscle strength and flexibility while strengthening muscles most important to good health and wellness. Her asides are excellent and the pictures of her exercises look great. I have already used some of her examples ie posture and correct ergonomics while at the computer for home exercises for my patients. She has pulled some of the best Pilates based exercises and Yoga postures to make her program current, unique and fun. She is a great advocate for the physical therapy profession, and I will highly recommend this book to my own patients."
4,A Gregorian Chant Medley!,"The Monks of L'Calcat do an outstanding job with the classic Gregorian Chants hymns, however the Exultet sounds a bit 'grainy' and may need to be digitally reworked, if possible.For anyone interested in Gregorian Chant music, I would certainly recommend that they add this reasonably priced CD to their collection."
4,One Little Problem,I puchased this for my Bride to complete a set of 8. The only problem is that the new setting is made in China instead of England. The English made place setting included the Bread and Butter plate instead of the larger salad plate that comes with this new Chinese set. Not a big problem. I just need to find 4 more bread and butter plate or the larger salad plate. Whatever my Wife wants.
5,Perfect Match,I love this place setting because it is a perfect match with my 40 year old Friendly Village set for 12. A few pieces had chipped over the years and this place setting replaced those pieces.
5,Mind melting low-fi genius !!!,"Wow!! If you like to spark one up and melt your mind to the likes of ween, Bowie, Buthole surfers, then you will love this. This is a pure collection of bedroom recordings on a par with Ween's ""The Pod"".There is such a range of sounds involved in this album, ecclecticly fantastic!!!"
2,cheap plugs,"These plug were cheap. I used in a 05 Katana, and my bike didnt run very good. Put new expensive plugs in, and the bike runs awsome."
1,you may get what you paid for,"my new subwoofer lasted one hour exactly, and died. Cycling power on/off lets it play 20-30 min max, before it dies again.Waiting for resolution from the vendor."
2,Godd for beginner but not enough to do stuff,"This book falls somewhere between ""The most USELESS book..."" and a book that is not detailed enough to really use. For beginners yes, its probably a good start, although XPe is not for beginners, it for serious programmers that need to crowbar XP into small things. I ordered this book and ""Windows XP Advanced"" by Sean D. Liming, and found that ""Windows XP Advanced"" was all that is needed."
2,"Save your money, read the online docs","While it may have been useful in 2003, in 2010 the book tells very little that can not be learned from the online documentation. I have been working with Windows Embedded Standard 2009 for four months. This book has helped me exactly once; everything else has come from Microsoft's MSDN or from online forums.Bottom line: Save your money. Other books may prove more valuable."
5,unsual and diffrent book to read not the norm,I found this book intreaging. It kept me moving to the end just to see if this little girl could acomplish just what she set out to do. With out the helping hand that some times is not wanted.I also found out that there are several seriver tips along with a strange way to use your belt. that no mater what things can get bad but if you keep going you can come out on top. tthis book is diffrent from most romance novels with the norm you can gess that the man get's the girl here the girl gets the man and a good life. check it out you will see the diffrence. you like indania jones this is simular.
4,Bob,"I had to buy two copies. I had one for my wife, but then I started reading it and she wouldn't let me take it to finish on a TWO DAY business trip because by that time she'd started it and didn't want to put it down. Good read."
5,Strong cinnamon flavor! Cool packaging.,"This is my first day reviewing on Amazon, and I have already written 2 for Hint Mints, because they're the coolest breath mints out there! I have yet to try the other flavors (chocolate and licorice), but love the peppermints. Cinnamon is really good, too, and some people prefer it to pepp. INCREDIBLE prices on amazon- Lovin' the amazon shopping! But 5 reviews in one day is enough, i think :)"
2,Easy read but poorly edited.,"Book presumes a general knowledge of Irish history and is therefore a little hard to follow. Poorly edited: index is inaccurate, blank spaces on pages, grammatical errors. Refers to people without explaining who they are. A chatty tone makes it a fairly easy read; seems to have an anti-British, anti-Protestant bias. Not what you're looking for if you want an overview of Irish history (which I did!) Found the part about Easter Uprising of 1916 especially confusing, even though there were several bios from that era."
5,Stunning Film! A Must-see!,This is without question one of the most brilliant films that I've seen. It's hands down the best film of 2011. I love it so much and recommend it to everyone.
4,Great pictures,Purchased this book as a gift for my mother-in-law and we have all enjoyed reading it and looking at the pictures to indentify the hummingbirds that visit her feeder. Gives lots of helpful advice on care and maintenance on the feeders as well.
2,The Hummingbird Book,"Was hoping that this book would have more detailed information, plus it was published some years ago. Might be helpful if you know nothing about hummingbirds."
2,"engine malfunctioned, only ran for a few minutes before it quit runnihg","the train engine only ran for about 10 minutes before it quit working. in process of trying to get it replaced. very unhappy 8 year old, this was to be his first electric train."
5,You'll like it,"As the disabilities host on Bellaonline, I recommend this book. This book covers Cerebral Palsy, and what it is like to have a child with cerebral palsy. It talks about the family dynamics, how to encourage your child to be independent, how to handle friends, and how to discuss the disability.I'd recommend this book to both parents and educators."
1,Had to replace it after 1 years and 6 months,"Hard drive is crap, it only comes with a 1 year warranty and this piece of ... started acting up after 1 year and 6 months. In a nutshell, it has some bad sectors and it won't boot if it's hot. Got to wait a while for it to cool off and before I can boot from it again. Guessing it's just a matter of time before it goes out completely.Note, my system boots fine from other hard drives..."
5,HD,"Installed in about 10 minutes (plus the 15 minutes reading the book to make sure I was doing it right). Installation is breeze, but most of the time was making sure I was doing it right."
4,Western Digital 500 GB SATA Internal Hard Drive,"I added this SATA disk drive to new desktop PC. This system is using Windows Vista. Although I have only had this drive for a few weeks, it seems to be working well. I have used the drive for video capture and editing. My only surprise was that I needed to purchase a $5.34 cable to convert normal 4-wire power to SATA power. If I needed another hard drive I would purchase this same drive again."
2,Not so great for injections.,"Tip does not keep the needle on well. The numbers are easy to read, but so big they obscure the fluid level."
4,"For an adult - no, for a kid - YES!","To an adult collector, this toy will likely hold little attraction - I'm a 30-something Dad who still loves toys and thinks a lot of Star Wars toys are cool... and I looked at this thing and went ""Blechhh"".BUTMy little son absolutely loves it, there are many play areas, many little things to do and it takes the mind of a child to really appreciate it.Blasting lava balls, breakaway catwalks, a flip-over lava pool that your ""Star Wars guys"" can vanish into, a tunnel under the mountain (just a tunnel can be magnificent fun to a kid, remember?), a spinning platform and two action figures with limited articulation ( a negative for the adult collector but a BIG plus to a little one who gets frustrated with the 'super poseability' of some action figures).It won't hold the interest of a 30-40 year old huddled in his or his folks' basement - but a 4 year old will be enthralled."
5,Great toy,"I got this toy a few days ago,and I really like it.Over all it can do five things.1.Breakaway catwalks 2.Spinning jedi action 3.Flip over lava 4.Blasting magma 5.Mid-air battles. I put all my action figures on it and it looked really cool.A really cool toy."
2,"Big change in Sigil, but not much fun.","This is not a good adventure to buy if you liked Sigil the way it was. Most of the factols are dispensed with in an offhanded manner that does not involve the PC's at all. It is good if you are getting tired of Planescape and want to change some things, but don't worry about it if you want to keep your Sigil as it is."
4,Girls' Voices not the Issue,"the novel, which deals with church politics and life in a small community. I agree that the number of characters reduces the depth in which each is presented, but this is a technique deliberately chosen, as with Dickens, when socio-ecclesiastical-political matters are at the forefront. 'The Choir' is a well-written novel, an enjoyable read, with more serious concerns which never bog it down in authorial pontification."
2,Robert Kushner: Gardens of Earthly Delight,Very disappointed with the book. I was hoping the book would have more flower-paintings since the book calls Gardens of Earthly Delight.Although over half of the reproductions (about 50 of 80) are of abstract people and other abstracts instead of flowers.Colorplates are small - pages are with huge margins.If you like flowers of Robert Kushner rather then his other abstracts I do not recommend the book. You will be disappointed.
5,Highly recommended for aspiring chefs of all skill and experience levels,"The Best of Lidia is a DVD collection some of the most beloved recipes by public television chef Lidia Matticchio Bastianich, best known for her sumptuous Italian cooking that the whole family can enjoy. The Best of Lidia features recipes from Lidia's travels across Italy, from zesty starters to quick pastas, main courses, and desserts fit for a prince! A wonderful addition to culinary DVD libraries, The Best of Lidia lives up to its title with easy-to-follow instructions for preparing delicious recipes, and is highly recommended for aspiring chefs of all skill and experience levels. 85 minutes, widescreen, closed captioned."
4,"Passionate, Driven and Unrelenting","As soon as I heard that NY was releasing the Raw version of his acclaimed yet controversial record from 2006, ""Living With War"" I knew right away that it would pack a punch, minus the choirs and minimal overdubs, that would place it up amongst the best rock albums the man has ever put out. Neil has written better songs but you have to take your hat of at the continued passion and drive and urgency that still runs through his veins. This record has an instant impact and rocks, sending home all the messages Neil wanted to put out in regard to the records subjects. A power trio recording captures the essence of the material and gets a thumbs up from me."
2,The German Raider Atlantis,"I am sorry, but I was very disappointed with my purchase. I ordered the same title from another company (thru Amazon also)at the same time, because I wanted to give my 2 children one each. (My father was captain on one of the ships which were captured by the Atlantis). The book from the other company came first and was in good condition. The book from IPB-Books was in very bad condition and cost 3 times as much as the good one. I am sorry to be negative, but this was a big disappointment. The very first since I started shopping from Amazon many years ago."
2,Lilly Sells Out,"I'm a sucker for a good historical romance, and I'm mildly obsessed with the Lowell mills. Sadly, this book failed to satisfy either of my passions. The writing is clunky and the historical accuracy dubious in places. The religious messages seem awkwardly inserted and more appropriate to modern Christianity than that of the 1820s. And Lilly is an unsympathetic heroine who causes a near-fatal accident--to which she never confesses and doesn't even seem very sorry about--in her misguided attempt to bring down the mills, and then happily abandons all notion of doing anything to improve the lives of the mill girls once she gets married. This book had the potential to make some important points about the consequences of industrialization, but it, like Lilly, gave up that notion in the pursuit of romance. Hooray for internal improvements!"
4,"Great dress, but runs on the small/fitted side","beautiful dress, but the size does run smaller than you'd expect. Order the next size up to make sure the wrap covers completely in the front or its ""peekaboo""."
2,Solitaire Game,"I have played electronic solitaire games before but this one was strange. I couldn't put a lenght of cards over to another pile, as if I was only allowed to play the cards that were showing on the small screen.Very strange.I wouldn't recommend this particular brand to anyone because of that feature."
3,2 in 1 Solitaire,"The game is okay....just not what I was looking for. Works fine, plays fine. I just need a bigger screen."
2,Okay if you're into academe . . .,"The editorial reviews of this book gave me a different picture than what I found when I read the book. While I read on a postgraduate level, and therefore didn't have difficulty understanding and absorbing the essays in this volume, the same would not be true if I didn't read on that level. For the most part, these are academic essays not easily accessible to the average reader. Considering that the subject matter should be one of real concern to much more of the lesbian community than those buried in academe, it would have been an improvement to either change the review to reflect this, or change the essay language to provide accessibility."
3,Too dark and too much panning,"I bought this tape because the other reviewers had such great things to say. I am disappointed. The music is pretty boring - a lot of drum beats. The screen is too dark and they pan the camera too much. What's with the fire?The video is a bit monotonous. It does make you sweat though. The moves are not very complicated but as one reviewer said, it makes for sore knees. Not my favorite video."
2,Lousy Picture Quality,"The quality of the DVDs is terrible. I was about to return the set, because I felt that it was defective, but understand that others have expressed the same frustrations about the quality. BluRay verses DVD would be worth the extra money."
2,Poor Video Quality,"The first three seasons we purchased had very clear video quality. The 4th Season DVD was very grainy, almost like it was from an old VCR tape that had been duplicated several times (i.e., a copy of a copy of a copy etc.). Audio was ok, just wasn't clear."
4,my kind of t v,"give it a trywe liked it you should give it a try we have been fans of ""chuck"" for years"
3,The Illustrations Save the Day,"This is a nicely illustrated book that just misses the mark.The story is of 10 little fox cubs who find a little lost girl in thewoods. After pinching and prodding the girl to discover what kind of thing she is, they help her make enough noise to help the girl's father find her. Since the story is told from the fox cub's point of view, it's not quite as scary as it could be. It still might be too scary for 3 or 4 year olds unless a little judicious editing takes place while reading aloud. The words are a curious mix of rhyme and text, which makes it a bit awkward to read. The illustrations save the day with the happy little fox faces and cute little girl, and lots of items to point to and name."
5,If you miss and love the show Friends......,"Then buy this set. I own all the seasons of friends, but it was nice to watch these compilations of some of the best shows. Each one is set to a different theme, and it's just neat to watch. It also starts with shows from the beginning up to the end, so it is fun to see how they actually ""grow up"" as the years go by. Definately a must by for a die hard Friends fan, and even someone who just likes the show. Would make a great gift!!!!"
1,Disapointed,"Received watch, removed from packing and found out that the watch didn't work. Seller told me to return and a replacement would be sent. Setter received and told me it would take a week or longer to mail replacement. I told them I thought this time was not fair, they had my money and I had no watch. Shortly after they informed me they were out of stock and would refund my money. They did!End of story I purchased a Timex from Fred Meyer"
4,Perfect first birthday present,"I bought this (for a LOT less than the $45 buy new price) for my only daughter's first birthday. I love how it came so beautifully packaged, and I love the ""classic"" look of the baby (I couldn't find a single non-cartoon looking baby doll on the shelves of 2 different chain stores). This doll is the perfect size for a toddler, and the little sleeper is easy to remove and put back on (at the repeated request of my daughter). The body (and everything but the head) is soft but well-formed which is also ideal for a young child. As much as I love this doll, I don't think I'd be willing to pay the prices I've seen it listed at since my purchase. For that reason, and because one of the baby's eyes often gets stuck in ""sleep"" position, I'm giving this four stars, but I'm still thrilled with my purchase."
1,I was unexpectedly disappointed,"Yes, this doll is durable and has a classic face. I was disappointed though by the ""dog squeaker"" inside the doll's belly to make a crying sound. It is literally the same sound my dog's toys make. Also, the doll's right eye is stuck shut more often than not. I had read, prior to my purchase, in another customer review that they had this same problem but I was swayed by the other overwhelming positive reviews. I will be returning this overpriced one-eyed dog toy. The fancy name brand doesn't make up for the price."
5,Godmother of City Planning,Great Book. Ms. Jacobs was ahead of her time with many planning concepts and theories. A must for any planning student.
5,"This is my favorite nonfiction book, period","Jane Jacobs is the metropolitan Thoreau. She makes her arguments about urban structure and its undeniable connection to social well-being seem like timeless explorations of the social urge itself. As a lifelong city-dweller, this book has really made me love my town, in all its messy glory."
1,"Great book, Bad Editing in this Edition","I chose to purchase a hardcover version of this classic because I wanted a good copy for my library. This edition by the Modern library, however, is filled with odd typos. I've already noticed at least five and I'm less than a fourth of the way through! I don't recommend this edition!"
4,A milestone for city thinkers,This books presents some clear ideas of how to make a city livable and safety. With some concrete examples of bad and good urban policies in North American cities it shows the importance of diversed land-use neighborhoods for the 'life' of urban areas.
3,"If you have to read a Bio of Jefferson for school, this is the one","This book is informative. That is all it is. My negative feelings for this book are mostly based on the fact that I had just read John Adams by David McCullough, and by comparison nothing will be as good. It is not a page turning, maybe I can read another ten pages before I fall asleep kind of book at all. But if you have to read a Bio of Jefferson for school, and you are not really that into the subject, this book is pretty much a Cliff notes Bio that will do fine. I am looking for a McCullough type of Bio for Jefferson so if anyone knows of one let me know!"
5,Jefferson - Short Biography,"I have read many books on Jefferson. This biography captured a lot of what was known to me and was a good refresher. For anyone not inclined to read long books, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson. I found it balanced in its presentation of the man."
5,Jefferson unplugged!,"I have had a yearning to read about many great Americans before I leave this world. Many biographies are 600+ pages, So I was skeptical when discovering this one to be ony 200.After finishing the book, I am a convert and believer. This author is amazing at condensing and distilling. It is just what I wanted; an interesting, enjoyable, and enlighting read. it fulfilled my self-imposed criteria perfectly. Another great American that I can check off my reading list!"
2,Doesn't live up to the NPR hype,"I heard about this album on NPR, and from the blurbs they played on air, it seemed like something I might like. But when I played the album, all the songs sounded pretty much the same, and nothing cought my ear as I had hoped it would. I may give it a few more listens, and who knows, maybe it will grow on me."
2,And the ending is...,"I love Fern Michaels books, but this one was really strange. I think it was kind of ragged and left you hanging about too many things. You were given people in situations - and then they were gone. I feel she jumped from from thing to another with out a complete story. And the ending...I still can't figure out just where things stand at the end. The explosion came too fast and was glossed over , then the book was done.This is just one to chock up to the WASTE list. Parts of it were good, but, overall, forget it."
1,Not Really Worth the Cost,"This was a book that jumped around a lot with characters in the middle of the book, they had no real purpose in the book, and was hard to keep track of them. It was sort of unbelievable at times, with a teenager moving in with an unknown middle aged man. The actions that the teenager takes in the most part are understandable and teenager like. The biggest part the explosion, was extremely short and hard to picture. The ending just ended. I did not like the book. I read the whole thing and will most likely NEVER pick it up again. Rent it from the library, save the shipping cost."
2,dissapointed,"Thought these gloves were an awesome idea. After only wearing a few times, the gloves are already wearing out and getting holes in them. Wish they were made a little sturdier."
3,A some what interesting historical look at guns used in various countries.,"This is an example of the saying, ""You can't tell a book by its cover."" This book looked very interesting by the photograph on the cover, but turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment.It is filled with good photographs and drawings of soldiers from numerous countries holding their rifles and handguns. The chapters include small arms up to the Napoleonic wars, from the percussion cap to nitrocellulose, modern small arms from 1914 to 1939 and from 1939 to 1986, sub-macine guns, pistols and other weapons. If you are seeking a book about pistols(handguns)there are numerous other books that focus specifically on those weapons.In conclusion, this book is about rifles used historically in numerous countries, but says very little on actual handguns.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Monadnock Defensive Tactics System)"
1,Crew Fleece Sweatshirts,"Item was HUGE, not suitable to wear to the gym for a workout. Item was returned."
4,"Comfortable sweatshirt, but runs a little big in my opinion.","I was looking for a crew neck sweatshirt that would hold up for awhile and also be warm. Luckily, I found one by a name we all know, Champion. The only problem I have with it is the size. I normally wear an XL for all my shirts and sweatshirts, but this seems a little large to me, even after I washed it. Doesn't stop me from wearing it though!"
2,Disregard normal sizes!,"I normally wear a large size sweatshirt, but after reading several reviews which indicated these run large I ordered a medium. Apparently I should have ordered small, as the medium is too large in the chest and shoulders, and the sleeves come nearly to my fingertips. They're 4"" longer than a size large Izod sweatshirt I own. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 175, so unless you're larger I suggest you order the small size. Other than that it's a decent sweatshirt for the price."
5,Excellent memoir,"Dr Vega gives an excellent and spellbinding account of her journey to Santeria. She dispels the myth that African based religions are withcraft or ""paganist"", forcing the reader to re-examine ideas of blindly accepting western religious practices without asking some serious questions.A must read for any student of religion and/or religious history."
4,Santeria!,"I had to read this book for a religion and race class, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by it. The visual imagery that the descriptions give you about Santeria are amazing. The book is also very informative about the religion itself. Marta Morena Vega has written a great book! If anyone is looking to learn about the religion of Santeria or needs to write a paper about it...this would be the perfect book to get."
5,Big Kid at Heart...,"Now, I don't care how old you are, this is a great album. My personal favorite is the Apples in the Stereo song, which if you're lucky you might catch the video for after one of the Powerpuff Girls episodes. Good entertainment!"
4,More Mojo For Your Jojo,"I originally purchased this on the power of the bands involved (Apples in Stereo, Frank Black, etc.)and hoped that there might be a few good cuts overall. Whoa, what a pleasant surprise! Anybody with a taste for supreme powerpop would be doing themselves a major disservice by passing this by. Every song is good...real good. In fact, I almost burned this out by playing it for my kids (ages 7 and 4). One spin and it was a must play for EVERY car trip. Interesting to note that ""Bubbles"" owes a huge nod to The Free Design. Oh yeah, the dialogue between the songs is great too."
5,"Widely gathered information -- places, people, pictures","This book is a reference for my travels, or wished-for travels.From the smaller Alsatian museums (such as in Bouxwiller, France) to the unique insertion of Elijah's chair into the front wall (in the older synagogues of Provence), the sheer amount of information and photography provided in this volume is impressive."
3,Not recommended for younger children,"My 5-year-old son saw this in the store and just had to have it, however, he constantly needs help getting him changed from Darth Vader to Anakin. Like other reviews, I have major trouble getting the boots on and off. Vaseline does help, however. Additionally, the head is hard to put on and I also have trouble getting the hands on. The head and hands are always falling off. It is even difficult to get the Darth Vader outfit on him. I would only recommend this toy for a child/adult who has the time and ability to get this guy dressed by themselves, or just leaves him as one character or the other and doesn't keep changing him back and forth like my son wants to. My son loves this toy, but I paid $44 for this thing and now wish I wouldn't have!"
5,FUUUUN,"It is great for all ages. Nothing i can rate low for this toy. I don't see what all the fuss is about the boots hard to get on because with me you just slip them off and wiggle them back on. Other wise its fun changing him from Anakin to Darth Vader in a minute. Includes 2 robot hands, 2 human hands, 2 gloves, 2 sets of boots (4 boots), cape, belt, 2 heads, and two changeable outfits AND MUCH MORE."
5,More Than Just Another Book for Men,"I read Jacob's Shadow on the recommendation of a friend and came to it with the scepticism that a man who in fact needs a book like this might be expected to bring to it. I found myself seduced by its clarity and was grateful for its lessons. In ten chapters the book covers ten areas of living in which men might well encounter challenges and benefit from wise advice gently offered. The need for men to acknowlege vulnerability and then confront that vulnerability with courage is both a chapter and an overall theme. In fact, in writing Jacob's Shadow Herbert Anderson made himself vulnerable and in doing so has given the reader a gift which is more than mere words."
2,bleeds,The rings look absolutely awesome. Unfortunately they don't like my skin. They bleed out on my skin. Because of that I can't give them a great score.
4,Beautiful phases,"It is to expect that sterling silver doesn't last that long under hard daily wear. However, I'm surprised that mine lasted pretty well. If I have money again, I'd definitely order from this guy once more!"
4,Memory Card PS2,"This device is very helpful, it goes along well with the Tomb Raider games I purchased because there is a lot of storage"
1,worst card EVER!!!!!,"This card didn't let me put ANY MEMORY AT ALL on it!!!When i go into the card sellecter that card said ""0 MB avalable"".The card is worthless."
3,Won't work with MultiTap,This memory card is not detected when connected through a MultiTap. I have not yet filled it above 10 MB so I cannot confirmed the reported problem with file saves to cards with more than 10 MB
2,Is very fickle...,I bought this card for about 8 bucks elsewhere and I have found it is selective in what game data it corrupts and what it doesn't... I've played both Japanese and American games on it and about 75% of the time it works perfectly. It's good if you have way too many games and never enough space and don't mind taking a test run of the save feature to see if it will pull through for you or not.
1,Works for the first three months...,I have bought this product a total of three times in my life. I bought one for me and my brother about 18 months ago. It worked fine for about 3 months until it just stopped working altogether. I cursed lots because I had a lot of saves. 8 months ago it was the the only PS2 memory card they had so i bought it. YET AGAIN. 4 months later it stopped working.
5,One of my favorite movies,I saw this a few years ago and have been wanting to see it again--awesome plot!!
5,An excellent class exercise,I have used this book as an example of concise but riveting writing skills for my communications lectures. Student held their own competition using this format. Their work was exhibited in the hallways and caused much excitement on campus. This exercise led to excellent year end exam results. I recommend it as class material.
2,The best short stories and a few that don't deserve the hype,The reason I give this book a 2 out of 5 stars is because only 2 out of 5 of the stories are good at all.(ratio) Some of the short stories are great.....but a lot of them are terrible. It's hard to judge a story in 50 words but that is no excuse for understanding the difficulty and excepting it as a good story.
1,When Mental Patients Write ...,"I am so embarrassed for Ms. Kennealy. This book, along with the vitriolic, highly repetitive ramblings (rants) on her website, are proof positive that she desperately needs some kind of in-patient psychiatric treatment to snap her out of her delusions."
3,as a matter of fact,"re: other feedback - several states, including Washington and Montana, still require fetal death certificates for abortions performed after 20 weeks. According to the Guttmacher Institute, New York is one of four states requiring abortion reporting under its fetal death laws. Regarding this book -- I found it to be a well-written divafest. The abortion details made the author more sympathetic, not less, despite her hyperbole on other topics."
1,This book is a piece of trash,"If you want to feel what it's like to be kicked in the teeth then read this book, otherwise save yourself the aggravation. Kennealy thinks she's smarter than everyone else for some reason (even though she belives in werewolves, demons and witches) and thinks she needs to tell you that. The truth is is that Morrison wouldn't be caught dead with a cook like this if he were alive (or sober at the timeof this ""torrid affair""). Buy a bootleg or An American Prayer instead of this nonsense. I only wish I could give this ""book"" no stars."
3,"Good to see, but not chock full of info.","I'd been waiting forever for this title, and when it came out I was pleased to see it 1) maintained the overall quality of the New Vanguard releases and 2) had some pix I hadn't seen before but was disappointed that 1)it seemed to have been written from an Israeli Arms brochure and 2) lacked any technical data of note. Worthy but hollow."
5,Extraordinary recording,"This is Kolosko's second release and again his musicianship is breathtaking. Wonderful realizations of Villa-lobos, Lauro and Powell with haunting renditions on bass flute by Carl Dimow. Extraordinary recording,a must have cd."
4,nice to have one at home,"Fun to play. Reason for 4 stars is the case. It seems little hard for small children to think that they need to divide cards in two piles to put them in the box. They just try to put all cards at the same time in one pile, which break the case easily. So, If there is an inner case, it would be very nice."
5,Uno Cards are the Best,You can't go wrong with UNO. It is simple to learn if you've never played them and they don't get old if you've played them all your life.Perhaps it was the particular company that sent me Toy Story UNO cards when a purchased regular ones. But the Toy Story themed UNO cards are fun and create visual interest. They actually have an extra card with a new rule that makes it more fun.
4,You Know Uno!,"If you are reading this review because you have never played Uno, you are in for a real treat. This card game is fun and easy for the whole family (while allowing for strategizing). It's actually addictive and families will tend to play this card game for weeks once they have it in their homes.Highly recommended for family entertainment or even over beers with friends. I have not met the person yet who doesn't love to play Uno."
4,Value for money,I received this in NZ in a week. It is a good value for money multi purpose axe. Shame I can't get other axes sent to NZ.
5,great ax,"Best ax for the money I can find. Its weight is in the head, which makes it swing nicely. The solid metal construction should make it durable. I haven't had long enough to give it a true long term test"
2,Campers axe,"The only problem with this axe is that the top blue part of the handle is hollow, so it could and will break easily."
3,"An uneven album, but not without merit","When Arlo is good (""Oklahoma Hills"", ""My Creole Belle"", ""Running Down The Road"", ""Stealin'"", ""Coming Into Los Angeles""), he's very, very good. His lesser efforts (everything else on the CD, unfortunately) are first-rate soporifics."
5,Excellent,"Reading Kevin Canty, you know the world is an uneasy, dangerous place, and people are peculiar, jumpy beings. The stories in Honeymoon show what's behind the mask. It's a familiar world, you think. It's also a deeply unfamiliar world. The writing is exhilarating the way the best fiction is. Highly recommended."
4,what you see is what you get,Product arrived in a reasonable amount time and packagedappropriately. It appears to be of good quality and most important my nephew got what. He wanted. I did find the item at a lesser price so always shop around for the best deal.
4,"was a college reading, informative, not too heavy, succint, good read","clear simple and sweet overview of urban cultures and how they developed in American cities, not much depth but great overview, enjoyed."
4,...,"I enjoyed this book. It is primary a discussion of cultural and sociological characteristics of various groups within a sub-area. For example, a chapter is on China Town in San Francisco. He talks about its origin and its ebbs and flows.I would have liked a little more rigor has to how to test, measure, or evaluate an enclave versus an area which just has many ___fill-in-the-blank__ people/businesses. What type of density or synergy is necessary? How many industries, besides restaurants, does it have to have? I would have liked a little more empirical rigor, i.e., numbers or maps that could denote an enclave or its boundaries. It tended to be too generalized."
5,larry,"I used this to drill deep holes aound my shrubs and trees. You MUST have a good drill with a reverse. I tried using my cordless and an old Black and Decker electric drill but those could not handle it so I bought a Chicago Electric 1/2"" heavy duty low speed vsr drill model no. 93623. This worked very well and was able to drill several deep holes with ease.I also have theYard Butler WST-1 Deep Root Irrigatorthat I use first in any area were I thought there were underground utilities or other obstructions.Our area is under an extreme drought and water restrictions are soon coming so this auger will help save my trees and shrubs with minimum watering.A local tree company wanted several hundred dollars to do what I was able to do with this."
2,This is heavy duty?,"The digger's length is a big help for tired backs and even without flat edges it held pretty tight in my drill - 1/2 inch Milwaukee. The problem is how easily it bends. I know the length is a factor, but my soil is probably as soft as it gets outside of a pot or flower box. First time it hits anything, root, rock or whatever, it'll bend. After that it's pretty much useless. Instead of a 2 inch hole you get anything but and the loose dirt is always knocked back into the hole. In sum, you get what you pay for and this is OK as a disposable."
4,Does the job.,Works great but only if you have a high torque drill. A battery operated drill just won't do it.
4,"Wow, best seat cover out there!","I really liked this seat cover. It has great support built into it, and lumbar support. The material is slick and silk like, or Neoprene like Nylon. Cleans well! Easy to put on the seat, and fits tightly! One issue I have, Lumbar is set and can not be adjusted or removed, and it is pretty thick."
4,Excellent First Step in Understanding General Relativity,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning the basics of one of the most important physical theories of all time.All the key concepts in the theory are clearly explained. Some important consequences of General Relativity are covered in some detail - gravitational waves and black holes for example.The mathematical level of detail is moderate; a knowledge of basic differential equations will get you through. The mathematical tools of General Relativity: tensors and one-forms, etc, are covered in early chapters.Problems are provided at the end of each chapter and range in difficulty from straight mechanical computation to challenging. Solutions to selected problems are provided at the end of the book."
1,Useless as a text,"Since the book is well written, why did I give it the lowest possible evaluation? Because the only way to learn physics/math is to do problems, problems, problems until you can do them in your sleep. For this reason, the traditional and time-tested method has been to allow the student access to the solutions to the odd numbered problems while leaving the even numbered ones to be assigned by the professor. For reasons unknown, author Schutz has decided not to make any solutions available to the student struggling to see whether they are doing a procedure correctly. The student is left floundering with no way to evaluate their progress with the problems presented. For this reason I regard this book as totally inappropriate as a text. (PS: As a 1973 Ph.D. from Kent state, I have repeatedly requested access to the solutions to problems in the text, but because I am retired, he is unwilling to provide such.)"
3,"OK, but not the best","This book was OK, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. You'll get a much better understanding of the topic by reading THE book on the subject, Gravitation, by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler. There's no reason to read Schutz as an intermediary before reading MTW, because you can instead read MTW's ""track 1"" selection of topics. MTW's track 1 covers about the same range of topics as Schutz, and is about the same difficulty level as Schutz, but MTW explains things more clearly."
4,undergraduate book,"This book helped me survive my first course in general relativity, which I took at a time when I was not prepared to understand the textbook of the course (Wald). I have mixed feelings about the book. On the one hand, I could follow it is as an undergraduate; on the other, the level of the discussion was such that I never really felt like I ""got"" GR from reading it. Maybe that is the paradox of a low-level book, but for comparison I did not experience this reading, for example, griffiths and jackson. There, I felt like I grasped E&M and one level, and then learned it better at another. Perhaps general relativity doesn't work that way, or perhaps another introductory book is better. I don't really know which."
1,Too much vocal.,"I guess the album is O.K., but I was expecting all instrumental like ""South of the Border so I was very disappointed that it was mostly vocal. My fault for not reading all the info. about this CD before ordering . I'll know better next time!"
3,Nice Story,"Gordon Liu has another hit, this time the story is how the Wu Tang Clan came about from the Shaolin Kung Fu. I like how they keep the two Arts as friendly as possible and complimented each others styles. The plot was good I thought it would be killing each other styles but no each schools. Instead there was class and friendship and respect for each others art. The Bad guy wanted both to kill each other so he would be number one, but no the two arts, through a contest, became great friends and good respect for each others schools. Nice film to own and watch."
4,Get this on DVD!,"You may miss an amazing opening sequence without the DVD. One well worth the price of the dvd alone. Storyline is good. I'm not a big Wuxia school fan and felt the drama was a little over acted, but on the other hand because its Wuxia, fight scenes are extremely well done. A must have at any rate, even on VHS."

2,I am in full agreement with the review posted on 9-9-01.,"...This movie is another round of mindless, glorified immorality. Even worse, this movie has an attractive setting with attractive actors (especially Morris Chestnut) but it's the same old tired WHORISHNESS that only African Americans advertise about themselves. There's NOTHING entertaining about this movie. In fact, it was nauseating. Either it's a Boys in the Hood (black on black killing) or another cheap knock off of Waiting to Exhale (Black males and Black females degrading each other). ... Tacky acting, tacky plot if any, tacky production. Better entertainment can be found in a strip joint."
1,Glorified fornication passing for a movie!!,"We take turns in book and movie reviews. Here is my say on this so-called movie/dvd.The only way to enjoy this dvd is with the sound turned completely off. That's right, just watch the entire movies in silence. At least your eyes will enjoy what will otherwise torture your ears and mind.Let's see what your ears/mind would miss. (I wish mine had.) Marital breakup over oral sex. Hmmm, oh, father and son dating same female (there are old testament laws against such). Black males and black females can't get along, what's new. And the big mouth no-talent d.l. hughley, yuck.I knew something was wrong when all my bookclub member could say about this movie is ""uh, well morris chestnut is fine."" I mean that's all she could say.Save your money on this dvd and buy a poster of Morris Chestnut, it's less expensive on time and money and mentality."
2,Passable,"After the recent success of films depicting African American actors I was pacing around with bated breath for the release of this film. It was okay but nothing to write home about. So many films and books portray men in a negative light and I thought the brothers would use this as an opportunity to finally have their say. What a disappointment. Denise having had a relationship with her lover's father - trashy !!, that could have come straight out of a scene of a tacky chat show. Another guy having problems because his wife wouldn't perform intimate acts - majorly immature!! One guy dating other races because he feels that sisters are losers - redundant, boring, inexcuseable behaviour !!!! Terry literally ditching his bride at the altar - It would take more than a hug for me to forgive him. The only thing that saved the film is a half decent soundtrack and the fine Morris Chestnut, other than that I wasn't particularly impressed."
3,"It's pretty good, but not worth the money.","My daughter is 8 months and likes this toy but there isn't a lot she can do with it. The nose is soft plastic and she likes to bite it while it shakes. She can't make it go on her own, she can't press the nose hard enough. It is pretty funny to watch her shake with it, though."
5,Great Translation,"I've read a couple other translations of Chuang Tzu and this one is by far my favorite. I think it conveys a lot of the intent of the text, including fairly specific instructions for meditation, better than the other translations I've seen."
1,The Worst PKD novel I've read,"Mary is a flake who practically dares you and the other characters in the novel to find a way to like her. She flits from one job/lover/domicile to another with some internal logic that seems completely inexplicable. I found no interesting philosophical quandary being explored as is true of much of Dick's work, just the flakiest of all his flaky female characters running from or to whatever runs through her mind or passes in front of her eyes with little to no explanation why. I found this book truly devoid of interesting characters, situations or ideas."
2,sports bra,this sports bra did not work for me mainly because the shoulder straps have no means of adjustment otherwise it's very nice.
4,best sport bra i've ever tried,"This sport bra is wonderful! It's both supportive and comfortable. It actually has cups so your bust is not smooshed into one big sausage roll across your chest like most sport bras. It lifts and separates and is very flattering. The firm support structure is on the outside so no wires or bones dig into your body. It also prevents most vertical and horizontal movement. The only negative is that it is thick and not made of those new high tech wicking fabrics so if you sweat a lot, it will get damp and stay damp for awhile. Although it definitely looks like a bra, you could maybe get away with wearing it without a top. I've seen women wear less at the gym!"
5,My favorite bra of all time.,"I started buying these bras years ago and thankfully Lily of France has not changed the style. It is a great sports bra for bustier women (I wear a 34DD).I wear it all the time, It is a great minimizer and so comfortable.It's not pretty, but that's not what it is designed for!"
1,Weirdest bra I have ever tried on.,"This bra had the weirdest shaped cups I have ever seen. I am a perfect 36 D, and this bra squeezed me out the top, and had a pointy little cup. Reminded me of a pre-puberty shaped breast. It was terrible! The structure seemed like it would be great for support, but it misshaped your breasts when you put it on."
3,Looks good in the book but not on a chart.,"I really wanted to like this book and i really tried to apply the methods to my trading but, it is not very accurate at all you might hit 1 out of 20 trades (which is not a very good ratio too me atleast). And the pitchfork is in every charting package that you buy so, i guess the market just fades thease moves."
3,You have to recognise your peers.,"He claims that his book is the only book as far as he knows that deals with this topic. He has not done his research then, so you can say that he is not qualified to write about it. What about: TImothy Morge, Gregg Fisher, Gordon de Roos, Ron Jaenisch to name a few? They are not exactly hiding in the woodwork. A quick google and you can find them all. What was he thinking? That his readers wouldn't know of these guys?"
3,At least it was cheap,"I purchased this costume to wear for a western themed party. It fit well, but the product is different than the advertised picture. In the product picture, the fur detailing seems thick, but the actual product was very thin and the fur started unhemming itself the first time I tried it on. Also, the corset is confusing because there is no logical way to tie it in the back. I actually had to sew the corset on and bought a longer ribbon in order to incorporate the corset into the costume. Although it lasted throughout the party, I was disappointed in how much pre-work I had to invest in order to adequately wear the costume."
2,a book with sentences,Never have I read a book with so many sentences. Complete ones at that. There is nothing more irritating than an imcomplete sentence.
2,"Good plot, poor fight scenes","While there is no doubt that all the actors in the movie had extensive martial arts trainning, their talents were wasted in the badly choreographed fight scenes. The fighting movements were slow, a trait of old kung-fu movies where directors were still under the impression that audience should be able to see each move of the fight. So don't expect this to be like the jet li movies where the fights were fast and hard. I give a two star only because the plot had the potential of a great movie."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"The Feet in the Gym is a fantastic book that kids are sure to enjoy. The story is fun, the language is snappy and the conclusion treats the reader to a wonderful surprise solution that is just spotless. I look forward to future books by this talented author."
4,George Ratterman,"The book arrived very quickly and in good condition. I don't know what I expected from the book, a Jim Bouton or Jim Brosnan type of expose of daily life in a professional football team of the 1950's. I was somewhat disappointed as the book lacked specifics, names, stories etc., but this was no fault of the book dealer which responded very promptly and professionally to my purchase."
1,Was not New like advertised. Disgusting.,"This item was not anywhere near New, it was very USED. I didn't even have to open the packaging to realize it. It had scratches and scuffs, but that's not even the worst part. There was HAIR inside of the packaging from the last person who used it! Nasty, nasty, stuff. I promptly returned it. Never thought I'd receive an item in that kind of shape from Amazon."
1,Off-label use I guess but it didn't work out for me,"I admit I got this rather on speculation because I was hoping it would provide a quick and easy solution to a woman's occasional lip or chin hair. It didn't work at all for that. It just glided over the skin and, while it did no damage and wasn't uncomfortable, it really didn't do anything about hair removal either.It really is hard to find products suitable for women's facial hair and yet it's a pretty common problem. Ah well. Back to the razors designed for young men I guess."
4,Great at trimming eyebrows but not nose hairs,"It's not very throughout at cutting so you have to keep sticking it in your nose and trying to get that last hair. Also, it trims the hairs too close to the skin. It didn't pull any of my hairs though.This product is much better at trimming my eyebrows."
4,It all depends,"Before I bought this item I looked at most of the reviews and was struck by the great differences of opinion over what is, after all, the same little appliance. It seems to me that much of the divergence of opinion is due to differences in expectations of the purchasers. If you have used these things before, you know that they are slow. You cannot see the nose hairs and have to wave the cutter head around in your nose for a while to get the job done. With experience, you will learn where most of the nose hairs are hiding and will be better able to target them.Also, the cutter is next to worthless for removing ear hairs that grow along to rim of the ear. Use a razor. The same is true of sideburns. To me the appliance does its primary job as well as anything does."
2,Stick a carrot up your nose,"The Wahl Personal Trimmer is better than nothing. But it doesn't trim nose hairs well at all. I agree with the reviewer who said you'd be better off sticking a carrot up your nose. Also, I can't get it to trim ear hair very easily. I'm not happy with this purchase."
3,"HATE TO BE NOSEY, BUT...","GOOD PRICE, MEDIOCURE PERFORMANCE. LOOKS GOOD, WORKS POORLY.VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM. MAYBE IT'S LACK OF POWER ISCUZ' THERE'S ONLY ONE BATTERY, BUT...NEXT TIME I'LL JUST DEALWITH NOSE HAIRS (THE CROWD SCREAMS!) WITH CLAM SHELLS & GREATBRAVERY."
4,Gets the job done,"Not really sure how you rate a nose hair trimmer - it cuts all the hair and it hasn't pinched me once in 4 or so months I have had it, so I guess that makes this trimmer pretty good. It is very quiet (to the point where some may think it lacks power), but I have had no problems with this trimmer at all. Its cheap and it works well - I have no complaints."
1,Compete and Utter Rubish,"This product is abysmal. I purchased it as cheap intermediary protection for my L-series canon lens until I could afford a solid uv-filter, so I wasn't expecting much. My expectations were apparently too high. The glass was just that, a piece of cut glass with horrible glare in a cheap bulky ring. And to make it worse, it wasn't even tightly set into the ring; the glass was loose and jiggled around (which made perceptible noise). Completely unacceptable product, would not recommend under any circumstance. I ended up throwing this out; save your money for a better filter."
2,Terrible Towel,I figured it was about time that I bought myself one of these. I was really excited when the package came only to realize that the black used to make the print was smudged everywhere on the gold. I'm quite disappointed in the quality of this towel.
5,Good enough to burn......,used it to burn in the tailgaiting lot at a Bengals/Pittsburg game.....makes a nice fire....lol. a a a a a
5,Terrible Towel - only if you're a competitor!! :),"Pittsburgh Steelers Terrible Towel. This is the product it claims to be. 12 more words required, but not much else to say!Go Steelers!"
3,Terrible Towel,"The item reviewed claims to be ""Original"". It's not even close to being original. The top logo says Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel. The bottom logo says an Pittsburgh Original. The Terrible Towel is for sure a Pittsburgh original but this towel is not. The Original towel is about 10 inches by 17 inches, it is in fact a real towel, in that it has a label that states it was made by ""Cannon"", 86% cotton, 14% polyester. The front shows a fan waving the towel. The term, Original, was misused/misapplied!"
1,Had Mixed Felings,"At first I got it and I loved it, but then I started getting these weird feelings toward my guy friends... im sure its just a phase... also i took an IQ test and noticed my IQ dropped 35 points. Now technically my IQ is below 70.."
5,Go Steelers!!!,Best price I found on the net for the OG Terrible Towel. Show your support for the 6x champs! :)
2,Titanic 2,The acting wasn't that great and the story is your typical trying to escape with limited time and water rushing in. Nothing new.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever,I don't know of a worse movie that I have seen. It is boring and the special effects are the worst I have seen. This movie is an absolute mess and I think they only made it to bank on the Titanic name. You couldn't pay me to add it to my library.
1,received,Did not like at all because it was not what it claimed to be and extremely poorly made. Would not recommend.
1,not good,"Help!!! Can I get back my four dollars and the hour and a half of my life I just wasted watching this no star film? Bad acting, looks like they used a cheap digital camera, but if you watch it you will laugh at all the bad effects."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Now lemme get this straight.....A Tsunami comes along and just happens to be carrying an iceberg along with it that crashes into the side of the Titanic II and rips it open???.........WOW, what a script!...How freakin' original can you get?, then of course, a much bigger Tsunami comes along a little while later and trashes it altogether just to make sure that we don't see TOO MUCH similarity from the first one.This movie was terrible, no wonder it went straight to video. There is so many things wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to begin so I'll just say what I said about EAT, PRAY, LOVE......I am a BIG MUCHO Titanic Fanatic and I hated this film, especially at nearly the end of the film when....Oh I don't want to ruin the stupidity of it for anyone but in my opinion, IT WAS STUPID!I am shocked that Bruce Davison associated himself with this schlocky film!Save your money and rent it!"
1,Was delivered in a timely manner,I do not recommend it to anyone it is not as good as it seems to be . The first one is the best.
1,not even worth it.,"I forget which site I bought this movie off of and I was so amazed by Titanic 1 so, I tought Titanic 2 might be a little bit better, boy was I wrong. The first Titanic was the best. I thought the second one would be the after life of it but it wasn't. So, I wouldn't recommend any one buying this. I traded mine in recently."
2,"Painfully plodding, tedious, non-Canonical","In nearly 400 tedious pages, we get enough uncorrelated plots to construct four or five good Holmesian pastiches of ordinary length. Holmes and Watson here do not even get around to questioning the major suspect until around page 215. Neither Holmes nor Watson runs true to the Conan-Doyle form; often they spat like a pair of old queens. As another reviewer has noted, Watson even commits the unforgivable (to Victorians) sin of addressing characters by their first names, about 3/4 of the way through the book, and consistently thereafter.The book cries out for an editor, who could have carved a pretty good 200 page novel out of the raw material here.The text is full of vexing misprints, typically several per page. Four or five are so extensive as to render whole paragraphs unintelligible.I didn't enjoy the book, and found it a real chore to get through. Not recommended."
4,overall a good set,cool train set although some of the wheels keep falling off and the cars are a bit cheaply made (engine is good). also if you purchase consider buying extra track...especially if you are running it around a Christmas tree!
1,Game was a flop,I gave it to my daughter for her birthday and the game did not work at all. I compared it to her other V Flash games and there is a piece missing from the back. She was disappointed because she never had the oportunity to play the game.
3,Eh,"Of the three Atticus cds this would be my least favorite. Not as exciting not as hard but still some good bands on it (LYDIA, BOSS' BRO IS DRUMMER)I would buy it again cause I love atticus but choose for yourself. You could flip a coin on this one."
4,One Of A Kind,This is an excellent book and in a class by itself. I haven't found any other bridal or special occasion books that offer such comprehensive explanations and diagrams. It's a must have if you want to sew high quality bridals or period pieces.
5,Best All-Time Gospel CD!,This CD touches every area of the heart. She has been able to put into words the incredible feelings that most of us experience on our quest for life's answers. What an awesome experience this music is! I'm buying one for everyone on my gift list.
4,Great workout,"I recently added more floor aerobics to what was an exclusively step workout regimen. This tape had more complex coreography than I had done before and it took me two times through the workout before I was really getting it. Nonetheless, the workout raises my heart rate and is fun. Great tape!"
4,Another excellent album from the band,"I bought the import version of this album because I couldn't find any news about a domestic U.S. release at the time, but now it's coming out here on Minty Fresh. It's another excellent album from Bettie Serveert. I like it better than Log 22, but it doesn't quite measure up to the classic trio of Palomine, Lamprey, and Dust Bunnies, at least not yet. It has that kind of potential, though, and I need to listen to it a few more times. Bettie Serveert is still one of the best bands in the world, so underrated. If you're a fan, don't miss this one."
5,You just can't help it...,"Loving this record, that is. I must admit, when a friend lent me the record, I was very skeptical, but the haunting vocals and catchy hooks drew me right in. This is a great record, and I'll defintely be looking into their past efforts."
4,A landmark text.,"The late Dr. Davis produced this book as part of the material used for training his grad students in WWII about chemical engineering aspects of explosives. However, the best part of the book is probably the section on the history and development of explosives. Davis was one of those scientists who had a rare grasp not only of the theoretical and practical aspects of his field, but also its historical underpinnings. This book doesn't compare with Urbanski as far as chemical engineering goes, but rather gives a brief overview of many diffrent materials that were in use in the mid twentieth century. I wouldn't recommend this book as a lab manual, but would heartily endorse it as a place to begin the study of the history of this aspect of science."
5,A real treat if you are interested in chemistry,"I ran across this book (earlier edition) as a student. I am not a chemist but I loved chemistry. The book is well written, draws from a wide range of sources and gives fascinating details of reactions and practical details which I just never found anywhere else. I read it with great enjoyment and I hope you do too. Just don't be a bloody fool and maim yourself or kill anyone else. The chemistry and history are fine. Buggering about with them can be a bad, bad move; trust one who has tried!"
4,color problem! help!,"I purchased my Canon S110 and I guess it's a good camera. After some intense researching, I finally decided to go with this camera due to hearing good reviews. Also, like any first time owner of a digital camera, I was excited to use it and try to learn all the functions. However, the only problem I'm having is the color mode. When I take pictures indoors, the color is off, even after playing with the exposure mode. Can anyone help me with this? Also the flash makes an area of the image too bright, this is when I'm close to the subject.Everything else seems fine, the movie mode is fun to use.One more thing, what's the difference with super fine, fine, etc.? What is the best mode to take a good quality image?"
5,"TINY CAMERA -- GREAT, BIG PICS'!!!!!!!!","This is my first experience with digital photography, so maybe I am missing something here, but WOW -- this little camera takes AWESOME pictures -- and this from a person who usually manages to jiggle the camera (OTHER cameras, anyway) just enough to make the picture come out blurry. But with THIS camera, one vacation and about 500 shots later, NOT ONE picture came out blurry because of my unsteadiness!!! And the simplicity of loading the pictures onto the computer -- even a computer neophyte like myself can do it. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants an excellent print from a simple to use (and just the right size to carry in your pocket) camera!!!"
4,Almost Perfect,"Let me first say that I LOVE this camera. Its tiny size, high image quality, and loaded functionality. A lot of Wow factor when other people hold it. My 5x7 blowups could pass for my 35mm. 8x10s begin to show digital artifacts. Let me post a few complaints to encourage Canon to perfect the product:- Movie mode stops at either 4, 10, or 30 seconds depending on the resolution. Other cameras can film continously until you run out of memory.- There is an annoying delay between the time you press the shutter and the time the picture is taken. It's so long that I can't even capture a bride walking down the aisle without her moving out of the frame. Fortunately, the vast majority of my pictures involve stationary subjects."
1,Stupid,This would of been better if it was actually a porn. It was really stupid. I dont really have anything else to say about it but I had to add more words so.
5,Critical for those who want to be respected in life,"Most of us grow up with bad communication habits inherited from our parents. Often times, we don't even realize they are bad. This books roots them out and replaces them with magic recipes for being liked, listened to and respected. I highly recommend reading the book and practicing its principles."
3,Worthwhile to the real jazz fan,"If like me, you have been a lifelong jazz nut, this is a must have album.I have the picture hanging on the wall of my Living Room and the DVD completes the set.If jazz is not your bag, it does not have much for the average viewer.Don Mather"
4,Excellent video related to one of the best photos of jazz musicians,"The famous photo is probably one of the most important in the history of jazz. Although not every jazzer of the day is in the picture, there is a ton who are. The video is most interesting and informative.If there were more interviews in the DVD, I would have given this 5 stars!Elliott Vincent"
3,A very different take on things...,"This book delves more into the intuitive and subconscious interaction with the Quartz crystal. It is because of this reason that the author so readily pursues the use of shaped, polished, and even lab-grown quartz because of the linking of these forms to the subconscious. While not a great book for everyone interested in crystal healing, this is a must-have for any extensive library because it adds diversity to the discussion of working with crystals."
5,Just what he wanted,My husbands favoritensong is possion he was so happy when he got this it was just what he wanted! Thanks!
4,Best single disc comp out on the market for now!,"22 songs pure alice classics and over 75 minutes can't beat it for the price. Nice remastering from Rhino. No ballad of dwight fry but that is just nitpicking, go buy this now!!!!"
1,Dont buy this toy,"We bought this toy instead of the Little People barn which two of my friend's children love because of the corn rowing aspect. However, as stated by other reviewers, this farm falls a part very easily, doesnt close and is very frusterating to small children. I do not recommend it."
2,Not worth the money at all!,"My 20 month old son got this for xmas, and it leaves A LOT to be desired. The other reveiws are absolutely correct. The barn is ALWAYS falling apart, when closed all the pieces fall out, the animals tip over easily and when you put them on the pegs to make the animal noises, it often doesn't work. You have to really wiggle it to get it to make the sound. And if the animal is put in sideways or backwards, it makes the wrong sound. My son like the tractor, and I think the corn part is neat. But that's about the only pros to it. The plastic is really flimsy and the barn always looks like it was hit by a tornado for all the pieces that keep falling off of it. Within a week, my son had chewed the bottom of the farmer to the point where the round plastic disk on the bottom came out (a choking hazard). I caught it before it fully dislodged and pulled it off. It might work well for older kids. All together though, not worth the money."
3,"Silly movie, good but misused cast.","A typical ""bumpkin"" comedy with a story that is basically a Chinese martial arts version of ""The Dirty Dozen"". Most of the ensemble cast is skilled, acrobatic and fast (particularly Mark Long and villain Jack Long). Disappointing finale emphasizes goofy acrobatics over technique."
2,Ok but not quite on the nose,"For a book titled CHINA CLIPPER, THE AGE OF THE GREAT FLYING BOATS one would expect to read about the airplanes that conquered the Pacific in the middle 30's. Not so. It took this short 170 page book 99 pages before the China Clipper flew and then only 44 pages were spent on the golden age of these flying boats in the Pacific. Nice book about flying boats so if that is your cup of tea-fine. If you expect to have an in depth book on the operation of the ""China Clipper"", save your money"
3,Dissapointed,I searched for a vice made in the United States for a long time. I purchased this because the manufacturers website claimed it was made in the USA. When I received it I discovered that it was made in China. I would not have purchased this had I know that.As far as quality goes it's nice and heavy. The vice closes at an angle though so one edge is always tighter than another. Given the opportunity I would buy another brand.
5,Took Two,"I used two books on my visit, the other was Driving and Discovering Oahu. They complimented each other and gave me all the information necessary for a wonderful time. There were no surprises, both books tell it like it is. What a place. In seven days there wasn't enough time to do it justice so I guess I'll have to make it back when the airfare drops again. For restaurant reviews, this one was the best."
2,Cheaply made,"I know, how can I complain when it's so inexpensive? Well it looks even cheaper and the black paint is missing in a few areas. To its credit, it is heavy and likely will work well as a trivet. The idea and pattern is nice, just poor quality."
5,Una obra que transcende el tiempo,"Este libro me fue regalado por mi abuela cuando era muy joven. La inspiracion del maestro y sus historias han sido algo que me ha inspirado toda la vida. Lo recomiendo al joven que empieza en su camino y al viejo que recuerda su jornada. A pesar de ser algo del siglo pasado, la historia transcende el tiempo."
5,God's Food is the Best Food!,This book has changed our lives. Eating fresh vegetables and fruits enables us to have living enzymes enter our bodies and obtain optimum health and plenty of energy. We have been applying the principles in this book into our lifestyle and have seen great benefits and many health problems just leave along with a good weight loss. This book is full of truth and gives a plan for a long life full of vitality. We highly recommend it for anyone who is serous about obtaining good health. We are so grateful to George Malkmus for helping us and many others to leave the SAD diet for an easy and simple lifestyle free of diseases.
5,"A great book on dealing with, but not curing, autism","This book is a wonderful story about a family dealing with a severely handicapped child. The anger, love and desperation all show through Josh's journal entries. Noah never does get better, and you can see the pain this causes his family. There is still no treatment that cures all autistic children, so there are still many families like the Greenfelds."
5,I love this book.,"I love this book. In the 2 weeks since I purchased it, I have read it cover to cover twice,in addition to picking it up for reference frequently. Mr. Mackenzie covers the gamut of watercolor painting in such a way that no other ""how to"" authors do. I particularly like the encouragement he delivers...since I tend to be very critical of my own work. I found his tips on techniques extrememly informative, and the illustrations are wonderful. I also appreciate his sense of humor (I can relate to the cartoon of the lady with the bulging eyes and the magnifier)! Mr. Mackenzie gives sound, down to earth advice, and he makes me wish I lived down the road from him...(so I could take private lessons)! Thanks, Gordon. Jacquie"
1,Stay Away!!!!,I purchased one of their bathroom faucet sets less than a year ago. One of the copper fitting burst about a week ago. Their customer service is crap and they expect you to pay shipping/handling for replacement parts for their faulty products. After this the parts will not even reach you for 7-10 days. I'd advise anyone to get a Moen/Peerless/Delta they at least back up their warranty.
5,like this pillow,"It took a little getting used to, and deciding whether to use the bigger or the smaller side, but after this we've really liked the pillow and no longer use a 2nd pillow for comfort. It's a little hard to fit into a standard pillow case which is too narrow and too long for the pillow."
2,Great title,"....after all such a faceless and dull bit of ""alternative"" is completely invisible, to me. This album is commonplace just like anything else that comes from the likes of Coldplay, Stereophonics, and the rest. I honestly believe this stuff belongs more to the ""adult/contemporary"" genre than to Radiohead. Buy this album if you liked U2's latest or something lame like that. But if you liked OK Computer, you aren't guaranteed to like ""The Invisible Band"". I know I didn't."
2,"flat songs, flat production","with the exception of a few decent singles (Side, Sing, Flowers in the Window),Fran Healy and company deliver a staggeringly generic set of tunes here on their third album. the lush, alluring arrangements that propelled ""The Man Who"" have been all but abandoned... instead, Travis now blesses us with tedious acousting strumming and consistently dull chord sequences. the fact that a lifeless clunker like ""dear diary"" would be sequenced as the album's second song speaks volumes (such a song would probably not even have been included on ""The Man Who"").as if this isn't dissapointing enough, the usually brilliant Nigel Godrich turns in the first dud of his production career. inexplicably, most of ""Invisible Band's"" tracks suffer from extraorinarily high levels of compression, giving the album a rather flat and uninspiring sound. let the buyer beware..."
2,Invisible music?,"Travis'second (commercially successful) album proves that they get far more credit than they deserve. After conquering the world with their overrated The Man Who, Travis ease out a new album with songs that could just as well be outtakes from the man who. ""Sing"" is a waterproof radio hit with such poor lyrics and songwriting that even though you're hearing it the first time, you can guess what's coming up in the next few seconds throughout the song. Possible future singles such as Side and Follow the Light add nothing, this is super-melodic, acoustic guitar driven stuff free of any highs and real emotions that the listener can feel attached to. Nevertheless, I feel there is still hope for Travis. From time to time, excellent production and sound help cover up Travis' dull songwriting. Plus, Pipe Dreams is an excellent song, which is out of character from other songs here. Travis can and will enjoy more commercial success, but they're still gonna be a below average pop band."
5,"Any can ""sing"" along to this...","travis's 3rd album comes out better and greater than the 2 before and equally as interesting and sing-along-able. ""flowers in the window"" is a truly lovely song that'll make any1 feel all happy and in the mood for love. the only problem is u cant stop listening to it! althought the words are often very simple they are real sweet and makes you feel like you can understand what fran's singing about. Fran is a true genios and i recommend any of their albums to EVERY one! although i know some people dont agree with me, i think this album is a truly great album what lots of people would enjoy so go and get it now! :D"
3,"Bad power wire, good speaker wire","Well as a power wire, I doubt this will be any good at all. It is very heavily insulated, and there is not much wire for 8 gauge. I will be using this wire as speaker wire for my subs. I'm sure this will be better than 16 gauge.. I hope.0 stars for power wire; 3or4 stars for speaker wire."
1,Not 8 gauge as specified DO NOT BUY THIS,"I received the wire I ordered today and was very disapointed. My first clue of a bad purchase was the weight that UPS listed on the package. 2 pounds for a total of 50 feet of 8 gauge wire, get real. I have some real 8 gauge that I purchased from Lowes, it is twice the thickness of what I received. The pictures look deceiving because the thick clear insulation makes the wire look huge. The wire from Lowes is 3 times more expensive per foot, go figure it is twice as thick and made of real copper. I cannot risk burning down my RV so I will be going back to Lowes and buying the real thing. The only reason I did not buy 50' from Lowes to begin with was I wanted something more flexible which this wire definitely is."
5,Very good power cable,"Great price on very adequate power cable. Seems to be true 8-gauge wire as well, unlike some products out there with double insulation to make them appear thicker. Running a Kenwood Mono Amp and Pioneer 4-Channel amp with this cable and both appear to be getting sufficient power."
2,Very Unhappy,"I cannot rate this item because it was never delivered to my daughter in Orlando as I ordered. On June 25, I placed an order online and requested that I receive an e-mail confirmation. When an e-mail was not received, I called the company and was told it was sent. On July 2, I called because my daughter had still not received the item and was told to give it a couple of more days. On July 6, I again called and was told that it would be resent. Today is July 17 and nothing has been received. When I call the company, I feel like I am bothering someone and being unreasonable to expect that I receive a product for the money that was paid. I will never use this company again and would never recommend this company"
5,awesome irish music,"i have many celtic cds and all i can say is that if you have any interest in this kind of music get this cd as soon as possible. it really is awesome, this guy is the real deal. in addition he is backed up by some a-rated musicians. i doubt you will be disappointed."
2,brown suspenders ( leather) they are not leather !,"The product was advertized as leather suspenders . The only leather, is the tips where they connect to the paints ..So there for the suspenders are not leather. this is definetly a misleading advertizment and also it says (NO returns)wonder why ??John Eanes."
2,plus size skirt,"I wouldn't have bought the skirt had I known from the description that it had a slit, especially since the slit was in the front and so couldn't not be concealed."
4,"a concise lexicon, with usable entries","Apte's dictionary is one of the handiest sanskrit lexicon's around. While nothing can beat Monier-Williams' for thoroughness, Apte's brief entries are highly usable. He has restricted himself to listing only the more frequent uses of words and roots. most entries do list multiple definitions, as well as examples of usage culled from Sanskrit literature. This is a good portable dictionary. It served me quite well for the first two years of Sanskrit study. As with all books published in India, there are occassional pages where it is difficult to read the print--don't complain, this is part of the Sanskrit experience. It is good preparation for reading manuscripts."
1,Poor printing quality,The printing quality is so poor that many pages are unreadable making this dictionary largely useless. If you are looking for an English-Sanskrit dictionary it is best to look elsewhere.
2,Readability,The printing and type are very poor.Difficult to read.Some words are illegible beause of bad printing.
5,Perfect backyard swing,"My daughter is at that age where she's ready to say goodbye to her baby swing. This was the perfect replacement. It's made of a very sturdy, thick plastic. The width of the swing makes it so comfortable for her that it's hard to get her to come in for dinner! Installation was a snap. While it did not come with the clips that attach it to the swing set, we had some left over from her baby swing, so we just unscrewed that one and hooked up the new chains. I also love the blue poly coating on the chains - no pinched fingers!Great swing for a great price - highly recommended!"
5,It's a sweet swing.. for little ones,"This swing hangs in the tree that our sons used to swing on when they were little. That strap broke and I bought this one in yellow. The ropes from years ago were still on the tree and we attached this regular length chained swing to the ropes. Works great. It is colorful, fun and my granddaughter loves it. She swings normally and lays over it. It is durable, soft and hugs the child. It does not have a protective strap but we love it."
3,swing,Kind of cheap - not sure it will hold up. Had to replace a rusted rainbow swing and the quality of this one is not nearly as good. You get what you pay for ...
5,comfort,I prefer mens socks to the sheer womans knee high. They are very comfortable and stay up all day without causing discomfort at the knee. Great for winter but I think they will be too hot during the summer.
5,New edition covers the bases,"I thought this new edition was very good. It has the info on shore excursions but also provides tips on getting around independently in all the ports. The excellent color photos and maps add greatly to getting a handle on the attractions and focusing on what you what to see. The background on the Mediterranean is also quite helpful. How can you go to this destination without knowing, and wanting to know, the fascinating history of this region."
2,Not what I expected,"This book has a nice history section and some beautiful photographs. However, it does little to help the cruise traveler to know the highlights of each port. It offers nothing as alternatives to the ships shore excursions. It does not provide best use of time or potential itineraries. It does not provide recommended tour companies, restaruants or travel options from the ship. It is a nice overview of the port and history, not all that different than what the ship provides while at sea. I wanted a book to help me maximize my time and value in each port and give me some options other than buying the ships limited shore excursions. For my purpose, this book was disappointing."
1,History Book not a Tour Guide,We are planning a Western Med Cruise and wanted to get information on the different ports of call. The description of the book led us to believe this was the book we needed. What we received was a book that provided an extensive history lesson on the Med!If you want to know about the different ports and what to see and what not to see find another book.
2,Little for the Money,"This book's title is correct; it does cover the entire Mediterrean. However, if you are looking to use this book to make plans it is rather thin. Too little information on each location and not enough detail to really help. Some good maps, but little else"
2,Useful characterization when you disagree with someone,"Didn't read it. Bought it just to prove a point that my account and internet activity was being monitored!US Intelligence agencies use and experiement with this stuff too. Try searching Amazon for more related topics and see what you get. Also, pick up the autobiography of J. Edgar Hoover."
3,Good content but only an essay,"Ordered the kindle edition and received a short essay, when I thought I was getting the whole book. I have asked for refund."
4,Important.,"Szasz is changing the world one by one; read this book and have a new perspective shown to you. Many may criticize his ideas just because they explode the nice neat answer of certain behavior being signs of a ""disease"" but, as I think you will agree after reading Szasz, THE DIAGNOSIS OF MENTAL ILLNESS IS UNETHICAL FOR THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. ""mentally ill"" is a value judgement imposed upon people by doctors and by society as a whole. Mental Illness is a cruel label and mocks humanity.That's right, you academics out there, UNETHICAL, oh, yeah, baby.... wake up and smell the pluralities. The good, better, best game is SO OLD."
1,worthless clamping mechanism,"I received this product in a large box, with the clamp unattached to the light. There are no instructions, and I have had numerous people look at it to see if they could figure out a way to attach it with the parts that came with it. So far, I am still waiting. One of those people, I might add, is a Registered Engineer with the state of NC. Don't waste your money."
1,"Not comfortable, not an improvement over stock seats.","I think the ""comfort"" people report here is largely in their heads. They buy the seat, they want to believe it's better than the old seat, so they believe it is. I bought two of these, and neither of us liked it. I describe it like this:The discomfort usually felt on your bottom on a standard bike seat is reduced right in the center by the Cloud 9 seat, but it transfers the discomfort to the rest of your bottom. So instead of being sore right in the middle, I was sore across my whole butt. In addition to this, the extra wide seat rubs on the back of the legs while pedaling, making a very uncomfortable experience. There is a reason good quality bikes don't come with double wide seats: They restrict leg movement.The seats have giant springs which creak and pop as you ride.All in all, I wanted to believe this seat was an improvement, but I find myself wanting my old seat back.I'm returning both of these."
3,Bike Seat Review,"I'm perpetually looking for a bike seat that's comfortable. I wouldn't say I'm absolutely in love with this one. You know, I wouldn't marry it or anything. But it definitely is wider than a typical bike seat, so it seems to distribute my weight more evenly, and reduce strain on certain pressure points. I guess I just think that after having three kids, I don't really know if there's a bike seat out there for me. I'm kind of looking for a bike seat shaped more like a papasan chair. Or perhaps a papasan chair filled to the brim with chocolate cake. Now wouldn't that be comfy! Bike seat manufacturers, feel free to take that idea and run with it."
3,Cloud 9 Bicycle Seat,"I was disappointed with the seat I received because it was harder than I expected. A friend had Cloud 9's on two of his bikes that he'd purchased about a year before and they were a lot softer. I don't know if my seat was from a different batch or if they've changed the technology. So, in closing, it was more comfortable than the thin seats but it was harder than I expected."
4,Good Time with Good Songs,San Francisco is better than London. Both discs have songs and by play which will make you smile. Glen Yarbrough's voice is outstanding.
2,TINY!,TINY! The seller should do more to make sure the buyers are aware of the tiny size. They are about 1/4 the size of a standard rubber ducky.
5,SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought these ducks for my 12 year old son. He loves ducks and when I gave them to him he started to jump up and down. you should buy them!!!
4,Excellent selections. Good introduction to music.,"I bought this CD when my girl was 6 months old. She really enjoyed the music and always smiled and laughed when I had it on. I liked it so much that I purchased the rest of the series. The liked the Playful Baby a bit more, but they are both worthwhile. My baby did not care much for the soothing CD, but they were all good and the best series I found after buying a couple of other CDs."
4,Uniden headsets for Walkie Talkies,"Excellant product, excellant price, hope to do business again, ty, for fast speedy shipment, a pleasure doing business with you"
4,Great square,This is an excellent tool that I have used extensively over the past few months. Good price and is a quality piece.
1,misleading- picture shows 3 units all different sizes,"the how description is misleading. there are a set of 3 drums shown. however you only get one of them when they arrive. and for the $20 we spent the 3 would almost be worth it but when we only recieved a 1/3 of what was expected, big time dissapointment. In the picture it looks like perhaps they are attached similar to what bongos would be. and no where in the description does it say item is different from picture you will recieve only one of these drums."
1,"Poor textbook, especially on the economics side - could be about 300 pages shorter.","This text book is very wordy and does not have enough economic examples or principles. Additionally, it is also very bias towards environmentalists, often coming across as a 'green' promoter, rather than an economics text that explains both sides of the story."
4,Pretty Good...,"This was a good history book, I enjoyed learning about two knew explorers. The illustrations really helped me to seem as if I were right there. The only problem was I couldn't Identify his thesis of the book, and that's why I needed to read it. If anyone can clear this problem for me it would be much appreciated."
4,rainy day in brooklyn,movie was bought as a present for one's birthday and they said the movie was great and very entertaining....thanks for the bday gift I was told ...
3,This movie will be lost on the younger crowd (including me),"I love Al Pacino. He's a dynamite actor and I'll never, ever be able to say anything bad about HIM, but I don't know about this movie. I agree that it's not really a comedy. I can't really put my finger in what it was, but this movie seemed to be missing something for me. Something about it didn't really click with me, and I think a small part of that is due to he fact that I'm not over 30. One of the seemingly important aspects of the movie (the Attica stuff) was completely lost on me. And while I love some of the absurdity of the movie, at the end, I was less than impressed. I think part of that is because despite Al Pacino's dynamite (as usual) performance, he alone wasn't enough to make up for every other aspect of the movie, which seemed a bit weak."
5,one of the best films of the 70's,"Pacino gives one of the best performances by an actor ever. Then add to that a clever script, Great direction, and fantastic supporting characters and you have a classic. GREAT!!!!!!"
4,ATTICA!!!,"I had always heard about this movie but never watched it. I gotta say.... great movie. A good story, great acting and a few totally unexpected twists. If you haven't seen it... your missing a gem of cinematic history."
5,A Good Small Camera Bag,"This Nova 1 bag from Lowepro is just the ticket foe carrying a small cameraand a few assorted accessories in a way that is not loose and sloppy but in a way that makes getting your camera out quick and easy. It's not push and spread and dig to get it out. I consider it light to carry and has a very nice strap with a shoulder cushion with a ""tacky"" feel so that it does not slide down your shoulder. I have not been disappointed with any ofmy past Lowepro bags and this one continues the good quality trend. I definitely recommend this bag."
5,Digital delight,"What an elegant piece of equipment.This is the first digital camera that I have owned or used.The compact design was,I have to say,one of the prime reasons of selection.A camera that I could use in any situation.I also own a Contax SLR&Yashica 35mm compact. The Stylus performs so very well in so many ways,as to compliment to my photography in areas where the other two are impractical.The zoom feature was particularly impressive in such a small camera,as is the picture quality.It does exactly what I expected & more.I shall be purchasing a higher capacity memory card,only because I am using it more than I thought I ever would.I especially like the top ""roller mode selector"".One problem of having"" labourers hands"" are the small buttons on some cameras,on this, no problem.In my opinion,just the job!!"
2,The Keep is a Book,"Meh. I also recently read the other The Keep by F.P. Wilson. It's about Nazi's vs. Vampires: Egan's book is better, but only a little. Egan's book also more fantastical. Not because it may (or may not) feature ghosts, but because everyone in the book is a fantasy: rich 35-year-old who owns a castle... former rock-star meth addict... intellectual, romantic prisoner... and so on. Books like these are supposed to be high literature, but they are just as silly as the genre fiction and comic books read by, well, genre fiction and comic book readers."
2,Not quite sure how I feel about this book,"I am really torn between 2 and three stars, maybe 2-1/2? I was very excited to read this book, the description was exactly the kind of story I usually enjoy reading. It started off OK, then got better, then ended....I think I wanted more. I haven't read any of Jennifer Egan's other books, and if they are similar to this one, I don't think I will."
1,kept getting lost,I felt this book jumped around way too much in the beginning. Then all of a sudden Danny was in jail. Up until then I wondered why he kept making comments on how the writing teacher had never been in prison but didn't understand. I must have missed something? When did he go to jail and why? At that point I got so frustrated that I just couldn't finish the book. It's too bad I really wanted to like it.
1,Don't waste your time,"I read this book based upon an NPR interview and newspaper review. It was odd, bizzare, and a waste of time. I wish I hadn't kept wasting time waiting for it to 'get good,' it never did. I enjoy and appreciate different writing styles, but the weird ""colon"" approach to defining who is speaking, thinking, or being discussed, not only was hard to get past, but constantly reminded me I was reading a story and prevented me from becoming fully absorbed into the plot. When people say the book is 'weird,' I took that to mean ""creepy-scary weird."" This book is just weird- odd, strange, hard to read."
2,Waste of Time,"I was in the middle of this book before I realized that it wasn't going to get any better, but I finished it anyway. Like other reviewers, I thought I would be reading a richly detailed gothic novel. Instead, I felt that the author set up all kinds of intricate themes that readers were supposed to ""get"", but forgot to write an engaging story around all of the themes. I have not read any of Ms. Egan's other books, so I'm not able to compare this to her other work."
5,I Thoroughly Enjoyed This Book,"Others have covered the subject matter so I don't need to go into that.At the end of the day and to put it quite simply, I was endlessly fascinated and cared about the characters. I think you might be better off if you keep an open mind while reading this and not assume or even try to know where it is going. Enjoy the ride. One more thing, what an eternal joy it is to find an author who can tell a story in a reasonable amount of time. I am soooo tired of bloated literature."
2,Best thing about this book was that it was short,"I don't know what all the hype is about this story - you could guess the ""secret"" from the beginning. I really hate stories that I can see where it's going early on in the book. Also, the ending really wasn't an ending.As another reader mentioned, this book was a welcomed relief from the bloated books out there. Too bad it wasn't better."
5,Really lovely stuff,"The book does a remarkable job of keeping you enthralled as the layers peel back and the truths emerge. I haven't read anything in a long time that felt this fresh and contemporary. I found the voices of the characters clear and distinct, I found the metaphors all worked with the simple elegance of a perfect card trick, and I found the story built to a completely satisfying and cathartic conclusion. Can't ask for much more than that. It was just such a treat."
5,"INTO THE GRIPPING SLEEP, THE KEEP","Amazing. At last a book that lives up to the hype. This is what I think Danielewski was trying to do withHouse of Leaves, but Egan has made a dream construction real. I don't want to go into too many spoilers, but there is a scene to watch out for, about two thirds of the way through, where Egan throws a hook we (well, I) had completely forgotten about; and if that scene doesn't make your scalp crawl, well, you're not a person whose scalp can be made to crawl, and I feel sorry for you. If you want stories about upper middle class couples going through painfully slow marriage break-ups (which seems to be the default mode for 'literature' at the moment), you probably won't enjoy The Keep. But if you love a good Lynchian dream sequence and a spiral staircase,this is unmissable."
3,Didn't get it,"I agree with the naysayers on this book. I think this ""might"" be a good book to read in an English class where someone could help explain all of the plots that didn't seem to mesh for me. I think it could have been a very good story if it didn't bounce around so much. Question: Did Holly commit suicide in the end to be with Danny/Ray? Or did she just jump in the pool. I wish the author had just stayed with the story of Howard and Danny."
4,a real page turner!!!!,I actually saw this book at the library and picked it up because I thought the cover looked interesting. I read the jacket and decided to check it out. Wow I'm really glad I did. Rarely do I read a book without first checking out the reviews on amazon. I actually couldn't put the book down once I got about half way through. It's a great read. I will definitely read more of J Egan's work.
3,Disappointing,"On the basis of a sparkling review in the NY Times Book Review, which compared aspects of The Keep to The Magus (John Fowles), I started this book with enthusiasm. The writing was clever at times and the structure, which cut between three or four venues and characters, was somewhat original. But the main characters - a cyber-punk loser, a hard-core criminal and a junkie/mother - were hardly appealing, the ""magic"" was minimal, and the story ended with a whimper. I felt the book needed another 100 pages or so to complete the story. Perhaps, like Fowles, Egan will rewrite and augment the ending at a later date. In short, this writer has talent but this is not her best work."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is not effective. I have a clogged toilet and traveled almost an hour to pick this up. I should have saved my time and my money, I wasted both.This product does not seem to be any more effective than a standard plunger. My toilet is still clogged, this plunger sprays dirty water around where the plunger handle connects. Not effective at all. If I could take it back, I would. I feel the manufactorer cheated me out of my money."
5,WHen the student is ready ...,"This book came just at the right time in my life. I needed to move forward from my then, dead life. It taught me that I was special and my achievements from now on can be what I plan them to be. It is well written and goes straight to the point, something that was alian to me before, having wasted most of my adult life deliberating and coming up with escuses for my inaction. I recommend anyone who like me before, is stuck in a rut, afraid to take action for fear of the consequences. It showed me how to plan and develop belief in myself again. I am telling all my friends about this and more importantly applying it myself."
2,Front cover damage,"Good book, but disappointed that the front cover had been folded over backward at some point in time so as to leave a visible crease."
1,"Terrible, Truely Terrible","I went to see this movie with my cousin, as he likes Cedric The Entertainer, and I find him ok. I went into the movie not expecting much, and walked out with only one thing on my mind: ""What a peice of crap""! I mean, this movie wasn't even funny. Who ever greenlighted this garbage wasn't thinking clearly. And, to make matters worse than the terrible reviews and the even worse box office, they bring out this PG rated edition. Now I'm not complaining because I wasn't gonna buy this movie in the first place. I'm just saying that even the DVD sales are going to do terrible now. They just butchered the original show right in front of our eyes so that we'll never think of The Honeymooners as the delightfully fun TV show, but rather the horrible boring movie. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!"
3,"Quality frame, buggy firmware","This is definitely a nice frame, a cut above the cheaper frames for half the price. The screen is absolutely its best feature, being sharp and bright. It comes with a good feature set, ie battery and 16mb of memory.Unfortunately, the firmware is very buggy, and crashes consistently after a few mins of turning on the frame and it goes into automatic slide show mode. I have an SD card with over 1000 pics preformatted and resized to the frames specifications. I made sure I have the latest firmware version. I tried it on two Philips frames, and the crash is repeatable. My other gripe is that the frame is missing other standard features such as speakers and mp3 playback, wireless/network capability, etc.If Philips fixes the firmware, I'd recommend it. For now, I'd go with something else if I were in the market. Especially so, since this is usually a gift for others, likely less technical folks, and for that, you want a frame that just works."
3,Philips 6.5 inch Photoframe,"So - it doesn't have a wooden frame, but for the price this is a good small size frame with a quality LCD panel. It does not come with a remote control and using the buttons and controls is not easy. If only Apple made photoframe at this price, or Philips engineers learn how to build a user interface from Apple products !I also regret not having bought the 8inch or larger as this is a wee bit small."
3,"Great book, but should yonge people follow this??","OK, so I am 23 years old. I came across this book and started doing the exercises. I notice that I feel pretty good while I do it. Same as the times when I was doing yoga stretching exercises. My question is: is there a point for a young person my age to even do these exercises?"
3,One more thing....,"I am still considering this book (that's why only 3 stars). I am sure the exercises are beneficial, however, judging from other reviewer's comments on experiencing stress, (...), back aches, fatigue, etc.. - these are typical symptoms of dedydration. As with any exercise program or just living in general, the body needs lots of water - a lot more than we normally think as being OK (other liquids such as juice, soda or tea does not benefit the body like water).I strongly recommend ""You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty - Water: for Health, for Healing, for Life"" written by F. Batmanghelidj, M.D. He explains why water is so vital, the benefits and how to do it. Water helps all bodily functions to work more efficiently down to the cellular level. Please note that among water's many benefits is the tendency to slow down and prevent premature aging.He also recommends vitamin supplements as well to round out your water regimen.So stay hydrated and enjoy your exercise!"
5,Great CD!,Road to Lisdoonvarna Castle is an excellent CD by Scott Williams. This CD is definetly for anyone in the mood for a traditional midieval/renaissance sound. The hammered dulcimer produces the soothing sounds for most of this CD and is a remarkable instrument. I just purchased this CD from Scott Williams himself during the Las Vegas Renaissance Festival. A must have for anyone looking for a relaxing piece to sit at home next to the fire with.
1,This book should not be for sale anymore.,Imaging for the 20th Century. Not recommended for those interested in CURRENT anatomical imaging.A waste of time and money.
2,minnie mouse shoes,"these simple shoe trees were exactly what i was looking for but was very disappointed when i tried to use them on most of my shoes which are not triple ""e"" wide. these shoe trees/stretchers do not fit into normal width and tapered-toe shoes."
5,Entertaining and informative,"One of the best written books I'v read that deal with training ferrets and what to expect when you think you've you had it all figured out. This books tells of dangers that could happen, how to remedy the situation.Beautiful pictures and useful addresses of ferret organizations, I truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing a ferret and wanted to do some research."
3,Thanks.,Pretty good book. It didn't cure my ferrets' behavior problems but it helped to put them on the right track.
2,boring,"this movie takes place in the lives of a couple of gangstas who do stupid stuff and bad stuff comes back to get them. doesn't sound too bad of a plot, but the problem is the lack of definition in the characters and budget. for example, a guy gets shot, but magically there is no blood. there was a few shocking scenes like a man getting tossed in a car trunk and set on fire and a preacher getting shot. only problem is the pace is just too slow. this isn't an action flick. it isn't even a good hood flick. i only watched it because ving rhames was in it and he is one of my favorite actors, but you can't fix bad directing.in other words, don't waste your money here. go and buy friday, boyz in the hood, dead presidents, or menace 2 society. those are much better."
3,"works for one dog,not two together, just like kids","I bought this trainer because of my dogs passion for chasing cars that speed down the dead end dirt road, in front of our house.If one dog was out it worked, but two together ignore whatever signal it sends to make them stop.We asked the neighbors, who have pets and grandchildren of their own, to slow down. Maybe they need the trainer collar."
5,Walter Mitty has nothing on Dick Terrific,"How many of us truly have an inner being just trying to get out? This book does a wonderful job of intertwining the two main characters in a fast moving humorous tale of murder and intrigue. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end. I love how Shaw allows Terrific to drop into the classic detective diaglogue with witty comebacks, it reminds me of Elvis Cole at his best. So, pull up a chair and cast your peepers on this one some weekend afternoon."
2,Poor arguments,"The USA has spent the equivalent of one trillion dollars in social programs whose primary recipients have been african-americans. There is actually plenty of data that suggests that all of that money tore down the african-american family and left it in tatters, where prior to the 1960's. african-american families and communities were relatively intact, drug free, and non-sociopathic. It is the social programs which have created dependency and sociopathy. The authors can forget about reparations because it isn't ever going to happen. The attempt to get them will only polarize the races even more so. In a land of opportunity where even the most recent of immigrants can succeed fantastically, african-americans need to look at themselves and find out what is amiss in their thinking, values, attitudes or behavior that holds them back while everyone else is getting ahead."
3,its not that bad,"This movie isnt that bad, it's not a big bugget movie people shouldnt complaint just because a movie dun have enough special effect to fool ur logical determination for how good it should be. THIS movie does make a point, its kindda taking the danger of eating mad cow meat point to a further side, u can even consider this is a sci-fi movie. Some of the scene have taken the materials too over-done and the cuttie Jena Malone is good but not that kindda acting u would say good if u compare it to something like ""erin brockouich"" from Julia robert, which u can kindda put this movie to the same catergory with EB."
2,Cheap and flimsy,I usually don't write reviews... but I was shocked at how cheap and flimsy this thing is. Maybe I am just used to beefier snow brushes being from Ohio. So not very super deluxe in my opinion
3,It will eventually break on you,"I've had this snowbrush for years, but today in the ice storm I did manage to break it. It lasted about 6 years but this winter got the best of it. It is a simple construction and I can say the brush part still works and is intact. Also the brush is sturdy and it has never scratched my car. I recommend it but you should buy a spare. I'm not a reckless brute with tools and it did break so be warn. Of course in New Jersey I don't consider the winters to necessitate a better/more expensive snowbrush."
1,"don't buy, it's useless","when using the brush, the shovel constantly scratch other parts of the car.bad design."
3,not as big as you see in the picture,"when I received it, it is pretty small, I have not used it but it should be OK, I guess. It would be better if it is a little bigger."
2,Not that good,I think oarnge rhyming dictionary is one of my best cd's. It ranges from crazy math rock to full blown emo to rock. This new album reminds me of listing to the radio. It has the same catchy lines and dumb lyrics as matchbox 20 and Sugar Ray. I was very disapointed with this album. So I think I'll give it to my little sister who likes to rock out to Matchbox 20 and then just pretend they broke up or something
4,You got Jawbreaker fans all wrong,I am huge Jawbreaker fan and as a Jawbreaker fan you have are used to angular aggressive music that changes tempos from song to song and sometimes within the same song. Jawbreaker was ahead of its time. I think a lot of people who have never listened to them believe they are some sort of pop/punk flash in the pan and that just simply isn't true. they have to be one of the most influential bands of the 90's with Nirvana and Green Day. The reason why Jets to Brazil gets so over scrutinized is because a certain singer/guitarist was in the oh so influential band. If Jawbreaker hadn't been so great than JTB albums wouldn't get bombarded with comparisons. Unfortunaley they lo longer exist but if Blake records with another band or releases a solo album he will get ripped by Jawbreaker fans. It's sad but its true. This album is not bad but is I would get Orange Ryming Dictionary first to get used to their mellow tempos and style.
1,Boo,"and i say that with deepest regret...this is where jets started to lose its footing...and the record to follow...wow...logical steps down from greatness...not in leaps, just strides, VERY boring album"
3,A little boring.,"This is a good album. But it doesnt hold my interest as well as ""oarnge rhyming dictionary"". Which was a better release then this one. First of all, this album is good for relaxing. But it seems to drone on withought too many changes or exciting things going on for a long while. Their previous album was far better. I suggest you get that one before this. There are some good singles on this one, but the album as a whole is not the best."
1,Fire and. Ice California. By Janet dailey,"This story is about a very rich ,very beautiful women who had a very rough childhood and built a wall around her heart. To get custody of her sister she has to marry and live in the house for one year with her husband. The road to love is interesting and encounters some trying experiences."
5,The best source for the life and testimonies of Quakers,"This is the first person account of the founder of the Quakers (Society of Friends), George Fox, and it is the best resource for the life and testimonies of Quakers. It is an exciting read full of action, truth and common sense living."
5,Steadfast Love and Living Love By: Debbie Alsdorf,"I completed this study (my first one ever), 3 years ago. I enjoyed it and having it been my first one, I got spoiled right from the start. This study was meaningful, informative and touching. It's a study that can be done in small groups or large ones. I highly recommend it to all people. It's personal and can have great impact on your life. The content of this study helped me to understand more about myself and how I can begin to align my heart with the direction the Lord has designed for me. P.S. It makes a great gift too!! Enjoy!"
2,"mediocre ~~ and I'm out the money, too !!!","These thigh high compression stockings by Truform have disappointed me. Although they do fit well on my legs up until the kneecap area, they slide down from the thigh despite the elastic at the top and this leaves red irritation marks on the skin behind my knees.I will say that they are easy to put on and take off, which is a plus because they are long; therefore when they go on easily over my ankles and legs it's great. Trouble is, as I mentioned above, they just don't stay at the thigh; they ride down after just 30 minutes or so and that's not what I wanted.Like another reviewer says, I will now stick to knee high compression socks. Try these if you want; but if you want thigh high compression stockings I would look for another brand."
3,slips,The Stocking slips down the leg a lot through out the day and rolls causing pressure to be applied else where.
5,Spectacular,"I own eight or nine recordings of the Well-tempered clavier, and can (or could) play some of the fugues. Prior to this recording the Schiff, and in some places the Gould, recordings were my favorite. Fellner's interpretations though are sublime - with the fusion of spirituality and technique that marks greatness. I've listened to his interpretation now thirty times and I just love his playing."
5,"Great Level, Amazing price!!","This is a very nice, heavy duty level. I was very surprised at the build quality for the $$ and would gladly purchase again."
5,"two classic albums from the Amazing Rhythym Aces/ Stacked Deck, Too Stuffed to Jump","Two of the best albums in the Genre, period. The Aces musicianship is top shelf, fabulous killer lyrics ! These albums are timeless, and should be in everyones collection!"
1,Sam Edelson Allyson Ballet Gold Snake,Lovely to look at with a great big problem.The heel on the shoe was plactic and wore down after the first wear. On the second wear the heal became slick and I feel down in the street and hurt myself. I threw the shoes away because they were hazardous. Rubber heels would have saved me a great deal of pain anc scares.
2,Leg on one of them was broken,I was very disappointed when my granddaughter opened this gift and the leg was broken off of the Stalter figure. I assumed there was no replacement for them and really could not track where it came from so we glued it back on. But the leg cannot move like it was advertised to do. These action figures were more expensive than I would have paid but my granddaughter wanted these figures so bad. So we were quite disappointed. Thank you
1,Not so good to a Kottke head ...,"I bought this CD after learning that Larkin is opening for Leo Kottke at a few concerts this spring. Expecting a fingerstyle guitar performance worthy of an opening act for Kottke, I was very dissappointed with the mediocre guitar performance. I was further dissapointed with her singing style; dark, monotonic, uninspiring. If you are looking for a Kottke peer performance, look elsewhere. If you think that Lisa Kudrow's character in 'Friends' puts on a good musical performance, you'll like this CD."
3,Tray is slightly warped so wobbles,"I had to add a stopper/pad under one corner to stabilize the tray. Otherwise, this a nice lightweight cutting board."
2,I thought it was good but it needed somemore pictures.,I think it would have been better if there were more pictures and more areas shown.
2,Review,"The shoes looked wide in front but upon trying out, my toes are squashed and it can be quite uncomfortable. Nontheless, the heels are nice and presentable. Can only be worn for a short time."
3,You get what you pay for....,"Overall this is a decent cup holder, however I found that if we made it too tight the plastic holders popped and it no longer worked. Buy it, use it, just don't over-tighten it!"
4,Never head a story like this I love it,It is so detailed with the situation that was happeningI like it so much they are a different kind of hero
4,Exciting Adventure and Mystery about Owls,"Young owlets are being snatched from their nests, eggs are disappearing. Something sinister is going on in the Owl Kingdoms. This first book in a series tells of how young Soren a barn owl, and Gylfie, a diminutive elf owl, survive the rigors and brainwashing of the evil St. Aegolius Academy. They band together with two other orphans and a blind snake in search of their families, and the Great Ga'Hoole Tree, a legend where ancient knights on silent wings went to do battle against evil and perform deeds of greatness. But first they have to fight their evil jailors who were out to attack other helpless owlets. At the end of the first book they set off ""To Ga'Hoole!"". And the reader is hooked and must get ""The Journey"" which is book #2."
5,School Book Project Review,I am aged 10 and have read this book for a school 5th grade book project. I gave the book 5 stars becuase it has a nice combination of fantasy and adventure. It has very creative characters and I really liked the way the book ended because it had a twist.My favorite part was when Soren and Gylfie escaped from St. Aegolius. The author Kathryn Lasky has written many great books including the rest of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole series.
2,Has nothing to do with real owls...,"Hey, this is a mildly entertaining book. It's an action/adventure sort of story with cute little owls. But the obvious deviations from owls' natural history are too much to ignore! This book (later books are worse but this initiates things) distorts natural history in an attempt to make owls look better: it makes owls seem very intelligent when in fact owls are some of the stupidest birds. In addition, it completely disregards the fact that owls are not the only birds that regurgitate pellets, or even that that's all they do! In addition, when *possible spoiler* one owl speaks of how some evil owls ate his brothers, everyone acts surprised, when in real life, bigger owls eat smaller owls all the time! This book could even be called out on minor technicalities (one character loses her tongue and now cannot make any sounds whatsoever). Like I said, later books are worse than this one, but this entire series must be dismissed as complete fantasy."
4,I lucked out to pick this book.,"I picked this book when I went to Win Dixie and needed to get a book for my English assignment. I just randomly picked this book and it turned out to be good. Though this book was obviously intended for a younger audience (probably 4th or 5th graders), it still managed to draw me in even though I'm a Junior in High School. Although I have read better stories, for being a young-adults book it's very good. I would highly recommend it to any elementary/middle school kid wanting to read a good book, and I would also recommend it to anyone else who wants to read a decent book."
5,the capture(the devouered by amanda),"Soren is supposedly knocked out of his family tree in the forest of Tyoto Kingdom of Barnowls. He meets his first friend in the pit of St. Aggies academy orphanage. Glyfie is not moon-blinked like soren, so they try to find others who are not. Hortense was actually 3 she was just really small and killed by puff(the pit caretaker). They will keep trying and hopefully find there famillies.This book will show what nature is really like Its REALLY REALLY REALLY SUSPENSFUL. iTS unimanigable to how much this is simaler to life."
1,Librarian,I am very disappointed in the quality of the library binding. The book is NOT library bound; it is not sewn at all.
1,For all You Owl Loving Nerds,"This book was fantastic! I love how Soreeeen and Jyle Fly resisted the evil MOON DWENKING by recited legends of the great and noble GAHOOLEE owls. I wish I had my own set of Battle Claws, and thet I could have met the CHAW OF CHAWS!P.S. I was being sarcastic. Its a HORRIBLE book."
5,It works and it fit.,It performed as expected. A wordy review is required to submit this rating. Everything after the 1st sentence is filler.
1,It is fake uniden battery,"I used Uniden phone with its battery for almost ten years. Earlier this year, the battery seemed dead, so I bought one BT-446 around $5 from a marketplace in amazon.com. It looked a smaller than real Uniden battery, labeld Ni-MH 2012H. To my dismay, it was dead by now, less than a year."
3,not the quality i expected,"This battery doesn't snap on to my phone battery space (just loosely connected). Since it stays loose, sometimes my phone dies when the battery comes off the battery inlet (sometimes just by moving the phone). Not close to the Uniden supplied battery which stays tight in battery inlet in the phone. I would have given only one star but the fact that it is less than 8 dollars compared to the real Uniden phone battery costing 27 dollars and it still charges my phone (and I could live with being disconnected once in a while), I decided to give it a 3 stars."
1,Ordered BT-446 - received fakes,"I ordered two UNIDEN BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden ""by Uniden"" from Technox Store.UNIDEN BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for UnidenI received something labeled:BATTERY PACKBG00043.5V 800mAh Ni-MHIMPORTANT: Please charge for 16 hours prior to first use.WARNING:Do not burn of punctureMADE IN CHINA"
2,weak battery - poor replacement,bought a pair of these battteries for our aging Uniden phone (that we love). One lasted 3 months and the remaining one has very limited time (+- 10 minutes) of talk time before requiring recharge.Just ordered replacements for these replacements.
3,Haynes Repair Manual,"I rember the old Motors manual and the trouble shooting section on automatic transmissions, for instance I have a 1991 Oldsmobile with slipping transmission when starting to move car in drive,l -- also it would slip when shifting from 1st to 2nd (now this was a Hydirmatic) When you wanted to go you had to put the selector in neutral and rev the engine a couple of times to pick up (unknown why at the time) oil from the transmission oil pan because the o ring on the pick up tube was gone|? Which the motors manual stated would cause the start in drive slipping, ""it was right on"", the slipping from 1st to 2nd was diagnosed by Motors manual likelly caused by a faulty neutral clutch bypass valve spring in the valve body which was again right on. Dont expect anything like this from this Manual. It is somewhat incomplete in my opinion. Thank You, Harry"
5,Great shoes,The large square toe box is especially nice due to the extra room. I walk 18 hole twice a week and these shoes keep me from having foot pains.
4,the sixties are alive and well and living in joy zipper,"of course joy zipper owe a lot to 60's 'surf's up' period beach boys amongst others, but they have enough wit and verve to be their own thing too.It should be noted they have a knack for a catchy chorus (i've been singing the words from christmas song' i love you more than a thousand christmases' all week ) and a sense of humor, albeit a little sick (see 'alzheimers')The overall effect of listening to this album is like a drugged out day at the beach in late summer. You know that it's all going to be winding up soon and that you're never going to be happier than you are at that moment"
5,most excellent book on nakshatras,"this is the best book i have found on nakshatras of the several out there. prash trivedi and veno(illustrator and editor) have provided great inspired intuitive insight into the 27 mansions and how they apply to character and action. the lavish color illustrations are truly magnificent and exploratory and the text can be read over and over. i refer to the book every day regarding position of moon and other planets and what they are doing (to us, to each other). for jyotish interpretation, not tropical. most excellent."
1,Don't buy direct from ultimate chopper,"I purchased this item directly from the Ultimate Chopper web site and their policy said they would not bill you until the product was shipped. They lie about this. I was billed on Nov. 3, 2004 for this item and still as of Nov. 18, 2004, I have not received it. They said that on Nov. 3 my order was sent to warehouse for packing and shipping. So that gives them the right to bill me???? One thing nice about Amazon you can count on them to bill you WHEN they ship the item."
1,Worst experience ever!,"After using this unit for a month the hard drive just quit recording!I had it sent in 3 times to Sharp Repair , every single time came back in the same state it was beforet(unrepaired) but with a note from Sharp Tech Dept that nothing is wrong with the unit!Only after filing a complaint with Better Business Bureau they decided to refund me the money I paid for the unit because THE UNIT CANNOT BE REPAIRED!A Class Action Lawsuit should be filed against them because I think they knew that something is wrong with the design of this particular model but they still do not want to admit it!"
4,smells good,"The lotion smells good but the consistence reminds me of my boyfriend's shaving cream. but it feels great on my feet, not heavy at all."
5,Worthwhile book,This book has so much information that I did not know.I believe that now is the time for this information to be givento us.I highly recommend this book.
5,Boot Camp click is my favorite group,I am a 33-year-old white dude from the suburbs in New Jersey. I am not a music critic by any means but this is real hip-hop I do love this type of hip-hop I don't even think people today are even close to having the skills that this group has. The rhymes are good the flow is good it's original. True New York City hip-hop East Coast style jersey wild. Reminds me of like a Wu-Tang Clan kind of group. I wish they would put out a new album
5,FIRE!!!!!!!!!!11,"BOOT CAMP CLIK WASNT PLAYIN WITH THIS ALBUM. AINT NO FILLER TRACKS HERE. THEY TOOK THEIR TIME WITH THE PRODUCTION ON EVERY TRACK WITH SOME OF THE ILLEST PRODUCERS IN THE GAME ON THE BOARDS. AND THE RESULT? A CLASSIC!!!. THIS LAST STAND MIGHT TURN INTO A NEW BEGGINING FOR THEM. THE BIG BANG, FISHSCALE AND NOW ""THE LAST STAND"" ARE THE 3 ILLEST ALBUMS OF 2006 SO FAR. STAY TUNEDDDD."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE NIGHTMARE,"I bought these mats for our Kia mini-van. I tried to cancel the order an hour after it was placed (I read several negative reviews about the company) and was told that it was. It was not. Mats came - in seperate boxes no less. Long story short - it was a hassle (numberous phone calls of ""I don't know who you spoke with...but..."" game) to get the company to pay for return shipping and a BIGGER hassle to get my money refunded to my credit card. As it turns out, the dealership sells mats that fit exactly (unlike these mats) and are comparible in price. I spent hours on the phone to learn this lesson the hard way."
3,Not a bad read,"Oldie but goodie. Solid training advice using time proven methods. Hal doesn't really give you training schedules though, so that is lacking. I think there should be more emphasis on what needs to be done to optimize development, which I pulled out to be 4 quality runs per week at 75-85% HR."
3,Flat Needle Broke,"While the cranked weaving needle is quite sturdy, both the flat needles are very thin and cheaply made. The flat cranked raffia needle broke at the thread end within a month. I was afraid the the other flat needle would do the same, so I didn't even bother with it and just ordered a better needle. I used the needle for lacing braided rugs, so there was some stress on the needle at times, but nothing major. I'm sure these would be fine if you were using them for something that didn't put any stress whatsoever on the needle. Otherwise, I would skip these if you are looking for flat needles."
5,"A quick, inexpensive way to expand your playing deck","My son has me hooked on the Duel Masters trading card game. As a surpise for him, I purchased two of these 5 pack expansion sets while he was on vacation. You should have seen his face when he opened the box and found 10 fresh packs of cards, waiting to be explored.This is an incredible value! At nearly $1 per pack for 10 cards, this is virtually 75% off the typical $4 retail price. These cards allow you to collect the 110 cards that comprise the Base Set. At the time, I took advantage of free shipping, which made the deal even sweeter. The package shipped first class and arrived in only 2 days!!!Take advantage of this great offer while supplies are still available. For me, I'm hoping the Survivors of the Megapocalypse and Shadowclash of Blinding Light 5-packs go on sale next! Enjoy."
5,Fantastic,"This is responsible for me being an expert strength chess player, and rising. This and Fred Reinfeld's 1001 combos book, for practice. Don't put the cart before the horse, studying advanced strategy while you routinely leave pieces hanging or get checkmated. LEARN TO PLAY"
5,absolutely great,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. I actually read it front to back although I did not follow by knitting samples like the book recommends. With knitting books I have found that different writing styles are the key to whether or not you understand the written instructions, techniques, and tips. Maggie Righetti is clear and very understandable. I have almost finished my first project from the patterns in the back of the book (the shawl) and it has improved my speed and confidence."
4,A surprise!,"When I first looked at the book, I thought there were no ""pretty pictures"" to look at. Then I started to read it, and couldn't put it down! I really learned a lot in the first couple chapters and decided to keep right on reading! I found that ""pretty pictures"" were not necessary because her writing is so clear and enjoyable to follow along. I am probably more of an intermediate knitter and found out all kinds of new things to ""keep me in stitches"" and not tears!"
5,Must have for new knitters,"Very well written, many essential tips for creating well made hand knits, as well as intersting perspective on the craft. Discriptions and illustrations are easy to follow."
1,How can a company survive?,I really wanted the Kichler Pendant light and tried TWICE to get it. I have to commend the chat line -- they really did try hard to help me out but both times the light came to me in pieces. I don't know if it's Kichler's fault for not packaging the light correctly or Amazon's. Whoever is responsible (perhaps the shipping company??) I was very displeased.
3,poor instructions and missing parts,"It is a nice light fixture but the instructions were very very very poorly written. The exploded diagram of all the parts wasnt any better. A few parts were missing out of the box. It is worth mentioning that the glass globe is at least 20 pounds, so be sure your ceiling can support that weight. The glass fixture has a few air bubbles inside which shouldnt be the case for something in this price range. If we had to do it again, I would have found a less complicated fixture to install."
1,Don't buy these!,"After weeks of moving these things around, new cables, etc. etc. the audio still drops out frequently. They are only 8 feet between the transmitter and receiver. Still bad even when my wireless network is turned off! Very frustrating. And I'm not exactly a novice either... Have been a broadcast engineer for years, and I know my audio and RF techniques and theory well. Creative seems to be no help at all, but I am still trying to get someone to let me return them."
5,Great product,"Worked right out of the box. No issue with interfering with wireless network or 2.4G phone system - have the transmitter sitting next to my router and 5 ft from the phone base. Built in sound enhancements sound great. Have it feeding into my Home Theater system in the next room.Paid $50 wi free shipping - caught a one day sale on the manufacturers web site. Within span of three days price on their site went from $100, to $50, to $200. If you want this product - worth auditing Creative's web site a while."
1,Got ripped again.,I now know why this was on sale. Nobody in their right mind would pay full price for this waste of equipment. Totally disappointed with this product. The sound card on the board sounds better. Don't waist your money on this device. It does send sound to another set of speakers but the quality is terrible.
4,Creative X-Mode Wireless Transmitter/Receiver,"I run the Creative X-Mode off a wireless lap top. Setup slick and easy. Sound awesome!!!If you are having a problem operating Creative X-Mod with your wireless internet connection disconnecting, like myself, it will in all likelihood be your wireless telephone. If you wireless telephone is running on 2.4 Gigahertz, it does interfered with your Creative X-Mod wireless because of conflicting band frequency.Replacing your 2.4 gigahertz wireless phone with either a 5.8 gigahertz or DECT 6.0 wireless telephone should alleviate this issue."
3,"Good Product; However,","Good product; however, it does interfere with my Linksys 2.4 Ghz wireless router when it is ""plugged up"". it doesn't even have to be turned on to inhibit me from finding the wireless signal on my laptop. otherwise is a great product, it does a great job on transmitting the audio with Super quality, just be mindful of the wireless network interference. I know the product advertises that it won't interfere but it did with mine, maybe it is a ""router"" specific problem. So, give it a try!!"
2,It skips,"This device was quite easy to set up and use. But it ""skips""--from a momentary skip to a pause of a few seconds--an average of more than once an hour, I'd estimate. This happens even when the sending unit is only 15 feet from the receiving unit and in direct line of view. I think it may be unsatisfactory as a way to deliver music from my PC to my stereo system."
3,Its works,Its works great! However it does interfere with my router signals ones is turn on. On the flip side it does what it supposed to do. Sound quality is great.
2,Wireless G network killer - severa collateral damage,"I have this and the Xdock also. They both simply killed my Wireless set-up - especially G band. If you have N band, then it is okay. But I have a mix of both G & N devices and router is set-up to broadcast on both. It is as good as brand new. In fact the xmod is not even opened after I tried Xdock. May be one day when all my devices are N band, I could use this. The quality is great though and it does increase the fidelity of music by adding some high frequency elements. Pity a good product cant be used due to the collateral damage it causes"
2,Cuts in and out,"I've been statisfied with Creative products, including my Mosaic player, so I bought the X-Mod. Easy set up. Sounds great. Cuts out to the point that I can seldom get through a song without lost audio of 1-10 seconds. I started out with the transmitter and receiver about 40"" apart and they're now less than 36"" but the problem persists. Would give it 5 stars if worked."
3,Windows 7 users be careful..,"There is a known issue with Windows 7 and the sound compression used, as it creates a crackly sound from time to time. Sometimes it's horrible, sometimes barely noticeable. Also, the overall volume level is very reduced. It's an easy plug and play solution, but if you like your music loud and clear.. I'd look elsewhere such as the Roku system. Also, the transmitter is a very bulk box that has to remain plugged in via USB. So, being mobile with your laptop you have to drag around this connected thing the entire time if you want music. I'm selling mine as we speak.."
2,can't beat it for the price - just don't expect it to last,"First off, this product is incredibly easy to setup. Everything just worked right off the bat. About the only hitch was I had my transmitter placed to close to my lap top which caused interference, but Creative did a great job of communicating this limitation. Sound is crystal clear and the device is attractive and compact. I plan on buying additional receivers for the bedroom, the kitchen and den. BTW I plan on using 2.1 computer speakers since they give great sound and are very affordable. I strongly recommend Logitech speakers since they always have great sound and build quality.I've owned these for a year and a half now and it's not transmitting anymore. Creative has no tech support on this product at all and have been totally unresponsive to my inquiries. It was very disappointing to find this out."
5,awe inpiring,"This is by far the greatest movie i have ever watched. Emmanuel is a great, action oriented hero with great one liner like ""EASY!"" and ""OVER Here @$$hole!"" And the late Kadamba was a very talented actress who deserves a nod from the grammy board. Grim, with his rock teleporting ability and great teeth, is one of the scariest monsters I have ever seen, just short of the horrifing Barbra Striesand (spelling?). And when Grim makes his Grim stew...well, its magic!"
4,"Murder, family secrets, love affairs . . .","What more could you ask for in a mystery? This is the only William Pease book I have read, but it won't be the last. This story had well-developed characters and a plot that was different and certainly more involved than the usual ""legal thriller."" I will admit that there were times that I wondered where the author was headed, but just as quickly as my interest waned, my attention was snapped back and I was reading with peaked curiousity. Although Mr. Pease may not be a household name (yet) I highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading his other works."
1,I have no knowledge of ordering this book. I do not have it in my possession.,I cannot give you a review. I have no knowledge of ordering this book now I have it in my possession.
4,Pretty Good,I bought this and it's pretty good. The grease comes off the bacon and the bacon is nice and crisp and tasty.The only negative about this product is the skewers it comes with are cheap. Both my skewers broke after the FIRST TIME I used them.The product still worked well even without the skewers though.
1,This is a cheap Quality Product,This product is not working anymore. this think this is not Toshiba Genuine as the iteam was described before selling. I want my money back or replaced by new item......
5,Small and convenient way to connect to the internet,As someone who travels quite a bit for work I am always looking for ways to carry less. This product is both small and light and a much better alternative to carrying a longer Cat 5 cable in my bag. It is well constructed and feels very solid.
1,I love EL wire - When it works,"El wire is really really cool. You can light your home, decorate you tree, or sew it on to clothing. It is amazing, but only when it works. I got one of these, tested it and it worked. I put it down for a couple months until I had a use for it. Then, within an hour of turning it on, one of the connections went bad and it died."
4,exactly what I needed,"I bought these markers to go with myBoard Dudes 11 x 14-Inch Plastic Framed Magnetic Calendar (12032UA-4). I wanted different colors so I could tell at a glance what day bills were due, I had appointments or meetings and such. My only (minor) complaint is they are called fine point but still fill up the squares on the calendar, it would be nice if someone made a super/ultra-fine tip. Easy to clean and low odor, these are a must-have accessory for anyone using a dry erase calendar to keep the household organized."
2,What you pay for is what you get.,"I picked this book up at a used bookstore for a dollar. After reading the cover of the book, I thought I was going to read about Lilith, the first wife of Adam and what she was doing in the world today. However, there was hardly anything mentioned in this book about the first wife of Adam. The book built up quite a story about persons (namely females) who had specific powers and a conspiracy dealing with HIV. Then it dropped me flat and left me wondering if someone else wrote the ending."
5,"Fantastic slippers, hubby is happy!","I bought these for my husband for Christmas, and he LOVED them! Super soft inside, and extremely well made. This was an excellent purchase, and I highly recomend these slippers."
2,"Get an American editor, Ben!","I've only just started the book but so far my biggest criticism is that it does a painfully bad job with the american idiom. Elton's rendering of americans is truly horrible. Imagine if you will reading a book by an american author about contemporary Britain where every Scott says ""och aye the noo"", every Londoner says ""cor luv a duck"" and every Northerner ""eh by gum lads"" and you'll start to understand where I'm coming from."
2,"Nice, but they don't charge the batteries...","The lights are very nice in every way - good quality, good looking, well packaged, etc. Only one BIG problem: I bought TWO sets, and NONE of them will charge the batteries. I removed the batteries and charged them in an AC charger and replaced them. They worked for a week, but then died. Clearly, the solar panels aren't charging the batteries. It's not the batteries, of course, since they took a charge on AC. I don't know if I can get my money back, now that it's been several weeks. I will give these another try and update - maybe there wasn't enough sun the day they ALL decided not to work, but it's a sunny day today, and these things better work tonight..."
2,Get What You Pay For,"I ordered 20 of these to line the walkway up to the house. The price was right to buy sight-unseen. They are fine, but the posts are plastic and very tough to drive into hard ground. When on, they look like Haloween lights, because the glow is orange. All in all, I am luke warm on this product. UPDATE: The lights faded greatly since installed. I think I will replace them this spring with a better product."
3,Looked better online,"When we received the lights they were pretty easy to put together. When my husband put them into the ground, one of the top portions fell off. There are screws on the bottom that are very tiny and easy to lose, but you must ensure that they are screwed on properly. There were a couple of more lights that ended up falling off as well during a rainstorm one night. They serve their purpose, although some of the batteries were already dead when the lights arrived and had to be replaced.Amazon worked great though, the lights arrived here in a very short time!"
4,Dated but wholesome values still there,"While the story, written in the 50's may be dated, I found relating to this character quite easy. My main enjoyment is that all the books are void of much of the violence that is so prevelant in todays television, books and computer games. I could relate to Connie Blair when I first read them in 1967, when I was 8, and I still do. If you are looking for a good, quality book for your child, you can't miss with these books. I only wish they would come back in print."
1,Disgraceful!,"The star is for Secretariat the horse NOT the DVD. This abomination is embarrassing. The footage appears to have been shot using a cheap 8mm camera from the 1950s. Most races are so blurry you can hardly make out one horse from another. This ""tribute"" to the world's most legendary and loved thoroughbred is a disgrace to his legacy. Whoever is responsible for this travesty should be ashamed of themselves. Unfortunately, the opportunist who made this was more concerned about a quick buck than honouring the greatest race horse of all time. Please, I beg you do not waste your money on this piece of junk. You can buy the Disney movie ""Secretariat"" for half the price and believe me enjoy it 1000% more."
3,Love the Horse...,"but not what I expected for $50. Repeated race footage seemed to be ""filler"". Expected a lot more non-race related scenes of the horse and interviews. Not worth the money in my opinion"
5,Holy Amazing!,"Even though the seasons to come would follow in disappointment, nothing could top the first season of the O.C. It was addicting drama and hilarious comedy all piled together-the perfect dramedy! Seth Cohen, especially in this season, rocked my socks!"
1,TV has really come to this.,"This is the Stupidest show I've ever seen. It's for people with no lives, and apparently no sence of moral values. The O.C.'s perfect for you if you have recently got into a car accident and are suffering brain injurys,oh wait even that dosen't justify why you would want to willingly watch this. I'm sorry I hate it so much, but I just can't help it. If you do have the desire to watch a teenage soap, at least try One Tree Hill, it's cheaper and you'll see Chad Michael Murray. So to you people who like this show, I say let the negative feedback pile up!"
2,No Asians in Newport Beach???,"Okay....Newport beach has a high Asian population, but there is no Asian character in this show. UC Irvine has more Asian students then UCLA. The real estate prices in Newport beach, Irvine and other suroundings got expensive due to the hight Asian population. With the story was more realistic...."
4,competent service delivery,"Having order the liquidmetal head Racquet from Midwest sport from America, i am very impressed of their service delivery. As promised, the item was delivered wwithin the agreed time frame and installed a level of confidence in me regarding purchase of product from countrys outside of the uk.. The product, on up to date usage, it's good, i have notice improvement in several aspect of my game and adequately designed to absorb shocks. all in all i am satisfied with the product and extremely satisfied with the service. Thanks Midwest sport.."
4,Great way to increase your fruits and vegetables,"I have been using this product for about three weeks now in my smoothies. I don't use it often enough to have noticed any substantial change in my health as other people have stated, but it is definitely a quick and easy way to increase my daily intake of ""fruits and vegetables."" I put it in all of my smoothies, from banana to berry and everything in between, and can't even taste it. It does affect the color of the smoothie, as it is green, but as long as that doesn't bother you (and I don't know why it would) it's a great nutritional addition."
4,Blast From the Western Show Past,"I was looking for Elmer Bernstein's ""Magnificent Seven"" theme music to enhance preparitory lessons for my students before they attended the symphony. I ran across this and it has been playing in my car ever since. For those cowboy movie/tv show lovers who were around since the 50s, this is a good mental reminder. The musicality of the performances is very good as well."
1,GARAGE SALE MERCHANDISE,THIS CD SET HAS A VAST COLLECTION OF TV AND MOVIE THEMES FROM WESTERNS. I GIVE IT HIGH MARKS FOR THAT. THE DUST JACKET IN THE CD JEWEL CASE WAS VERY SKIMPY. THE RECORDING IS GARAGE SALE QUALITY. I WOULD PAY $5-10 AT A GARAGE SALE FOR THIS SET.
3,"price was right for this kit, drill isn't heavy duty","don't expect drill to be a high performance unit.I would call it a forty dollar drill. whats nice is the quick charge batteries ,the light. the chuck is hard to get very tight. I had a dewalt chuck laying around and put it on instead. be careful not to drive too many screws and it will do just fine. this is a economy drill in their line of drills."
1,Not Really a Marshalltown,Purchased 8 of these for an archaeological field project. Did not pay any attention to the trowels until I was on-site and then saw that they were cheap knock-offs. By that point it was too late to do anything since I was in the middle of Russia. Bottom Line: don't buy from this vendor; you won't get what you paid for.
4,Good plugs,"I am an audiophile and I build my own cables and these RCA plugs work well for my DIY projects. They solder very well and allows a good thickness cable through. Signal transfer is also excellent. However, they are pricy and for the price, I expect better quality. You are pretty much paying for the Monster name here, so don't expect high-end audiophile build quality."
4,Reprint of classic study,"This is a reprint of Cohen's 1949 book. (Sansom wrote the foreward.) While amended in some respects by later work, there is a great deal here that is valuable and unique. Cohen provided much of the economic information for the U.S. Strategic Survey reports on Japan; this is much more detailed and comprehensive in most respects."
1,wrong product,the stylus did not fit the product. It was shorter than the original stylus and did not fit properly into the Sharp ZR-5800 and kept falling out when not in use. At one point it fell out and broke! The only positive thing is that I was only out $10!
5,Great dvd for kids.,As usual Thomas and friends dvd's always teaching kids about friendship and good behavior with others. Really recomend this dvd!
4,WHAT A READ,"What a find this book was I loved it. It was smart, witty, sad and extremely believable. Julie Darley has wrote a story that is truly a journey through life's rich tapestry, I loved the way she brought Janey to life and made me feel like I always wanted to read more. This book is an absolute gem."
5,A good read,"Stepmotherhood is hard, scary and unrewarding sometimes. Burn's honest portrayal of what it is to be a stepmother, without the rose colored glasses, may be scary, but it is honest. This book made the bad seem less so and made me appreciate the good that I have in my stepfamily. Her wise words, honest situations and the real-life examples are the reality that any woman going into life as a stepmother needs to see."
5,This book saved me hours of therapy!,"After ten years of doing it all for my stepchildren, and feeling like a failure, I read Cherie Burns' book and now I know I'm not alone. Why didn't someone tell me earlier that my expectations were too high? This book would be a god-send to any woman marrying a man with children. I had to read this book in one sitting. I am now rereading it and highlighting specific areas that I want to reflect upon, and live by. My husband and I have discussed much of this book and our marriage is better for it. Thank you Cherie for telling it like it is!"
2,need work on volume,"the phone overall is a good product, the one thing that made me decide to abanon it and buy another phone is, the earpiece volulme. the phone setting doesn't have anything to adjust the volume which makes it impossible to use outdoor even indoors it's a struggle to hear. i don't know the reason they setup the earpiece volume so low, but if they were to fix this problem i would probably buy another one."
4,comfy mattress,"I've had this mattress for about a month now, and it is very comfy.My only complain would be the lasting latex smell that stays for over three weeks.And I didn't like that the mattress didn't come with any instructions.I knew I had to let it expand for about 72 hours before sleeping on it, because I read it on this reviews.Other than that is a great mattress for the price!"
2,Kept Receiving wrong size.,"I ordered this product a month and a half ago. It was delivered in about a week, but when I got home to check it out, I received a Full size instead of Queen. I called Amazon and they returned it very quickly and easily. They said they had to wait for the Queen size to come into stock before they sent me one since they were currently out. After about a week they shipped one out to me and it arrived another week later. To my dismay it was another FULL! Amazon has returned the product and is offering a full refund. Amazon customer service 5 stars. Their product shipping dept: 0 stars. This product: I have no idea, still haven't received it."
1,omg do NOT buy this!!!!!,not comfortable at all. ive had it since feb of 2011 and its still not soft. my back aches and i get no sleep at night at all. absolutely worst purchase ever!!! we thought that after a couple months it would break in and be soft but its been all year and i cant wait to buy a different bed
4,nice camera for the money,I really enjoy this camera. I have also owned the 3 date. Both are similar; extra features on this one. Once in awhile the pictures are blury. This is probably due to operator error. One problem with the Minoltas is that they are quite breakable. My sister also owns one and we both broke the first models in the same place. (the back covers broke off) They were both dropped but from a short distance onto carpet. Now I make sure to always use the strap.
3,"Interesting, if a little slow","This book would probably be better for someone who had a better grasp of early european christianity than I do. I tended to get lost in the names & places. Still worthwhile, though."
3,Works as Advertised,"I purchased this unit to add accessories to my Tacoma. All the wires were clearly labeled and the instructions were easy to understand. The hardware was a little on the cheap side. My biggest complaint was the appearance of the fuse block and sealant applied to the back side. It was very messy and caused the mounting feet to be uneven. For a company that claims to be the leader in the industry, I would expect more. Other than those couple of complaints, the fuse block has functioned properly every time I turn on the accessories."
5,Here is all there is to know about the illithid race,"This book talks about the life cycle of the illithid, their form of reproduction, rituals such as the coming of age, entertainment, structure of society, new psionic disciplines for illithids exclusively, their view of life and the world surrounding them (individually and as a community).......... Also about ancient history, theology, forms of communication they use beyond telepathy and even more. Although the artwork is pretty average, the information presented here is really ALL you need to know about mind flayers. Excellent work!"
4,"good, but basic","well organized and pretty good definitions, but limited. Even just watching japanese news/tv, you quickly find yourself outpacing this dictionary."
4,sayonarajado,"This dictionary has the kind of format I like best. There are plenty of example sentences and the font is clear and doesn't strain the eyes as some dictionaries of Asian languages tend to.Furthermore, since the reader has no other option but to look up the English translation of Japanese words in Furiganga, there is constant Kana practice inherent in the design of the book. From an educator's standpoint, that is a very positive reinforcement tool for first and second year students who might still have trouble with Kana.Nevertheess, I only wish this dictionary were more comprehensive for advanced students of the language."
3,One Complaint,"The book is useful in that it gives sample sentences but sometimes when I look for a word the dictionary doesn't have it listed. Actually, this has happened several times now. Why are they skipping words? This is my one complaint."
1,Lame,"This book is fluff -- its description of the hedge fund world is laughable. You mean to tell me that scalping Nikkei futures is how the ""Ivy League cowboys raided the Asian markets for millions""? Clearly, this author is in way over his head attempting to understand the complex strategies employed by hedge funds to achieve their extraordinary returns (as well as blowups). The description of the Japanese sex trade is a boring diversion that eventually becomes an irritating pebble in the shoe of the book. Ultimately, the book is a superficial story lacking any real insight into how real money is made. And why is that? Because they ain't going to tell you!"
4,An entertaining read for someone who works in finance,"As someone who works in finance, I found some of the technical details of arbitrage trading in tokyo to be fascinating. Not sure where fact, fiction, and exaggeration intersect in this tale, however. Am pretty sure that the book is at least based on fact and, as such, provides nice insight into a foreigner's Japan."
4,Ben Mezrich is the master of creative non-fiction.,"Mezrich has a bit of Arthur Hailey in him and well, it is a compliment. Ugly Americans is a well-written book. I'm not too aware of financial terminology, but then I didn't miss a beat. It is not blinded with science. The style is engaging and racy. I loved it!"
1,Piece of Crap Book,"Absolute hogwash - the book lacks total credibility among my circle of friends - many who worked in Tokyo in late 80s and early 90s. These ""stories"" in the book are actually rehashing of bar tales we all heard back then about ""a friend of mine was in Shinjuku last Saturday and....etc."" I bet this guy collected this stuff while sitting in the ANA Hotel near Roppongi watching english-language cable. As for the trading...there was never any mention of an assistant to Nick Leeson back during the Barings scandal, the description of which is totally false in the book anyway(as is much of the other technical explanation of hedge fund trading strategy. Just nonsense...."
3,Quick Read,"Easy and quick read, worth the time. Interesting story about expat invasion of the Asian markets. The story doesn't really flow well and I couldn't find myself caring what happened to any of the characters even knowing they were fictionalized but based on real people. Enjoyed ""Bringing Down the House"" by Mezrich much more ."
3,Just like the 1st Motown Set,"It's nice that the first Motown set has finally givenMichael's career the momentum it lost throughout the years.I still love his 1st solo album after he left the DoobieBrothers. On the 2nd Motown set, I think he's chosen some bettermaterial to cover like the duet with Toni Braxton ""Stop, Look,(Listen To Your Heart), ""Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever""""Baby I'm For Real"", ""Tuesday Heartbreak"" and the beautiful""You're All I Need To Get By""- that arrangement is one of thebest I've ever heard. However, all the other selection didn'tgrab me. I have never cared for ""I Second That Emotion"" or""Mercy, Mercy Me"" and ""Reach Out (I'll Be There)- no matter whocovered them. However, it's good to see Michael get his props. He's still an amazing vocalist and songwriter and i'll definitelybuy a cd if it contains songs he's written or co-written, justas I always have."
5,Une suite très attendue,Le grand retour de l'ex-leader des Doobie Brothers.Quel plaisir de pouvoir réécouter tous ces standards de la musique noire des années 60-70 avec une qualité musicale inégalée . La voix de Michael est toujours un régal . Merci !
5,My songs,I turned my leased car in with this CD still in it. Was so glad to find it here. Loved all the songs and missed hearing them. I will make sure it's not in the next car we turn in............lol
3,Good value for money,The performance of these Advent speakers is yet to be adjudged since I dont have any 6.1 DVDs that can give me an idea of how these speakers sound. However when listening to FM radio I find the sound to be pretty good. As an Amazon.com customer for over 6 years I have always found their service to be excellent.
5,A Must for the home crafter starting to sell,"Very good author! Very good book. I was clueless on pricing to start out, this was so much help! It made my 1st and 2nd craft shows a success! Thank so much for a well written book and others by this author."
5,Cleaning brushes,"I use them every time after shaving and they work fine, and the packing was very good. I recomend this merchant"
4,"Practical, cheap, disposable","These brushes work well, and if you like you can trash them after each client. They are cheap and can last if taken care of."
2,uninteresting,"as brilliant as richard bandler is, he cant write a book for his life, based on a seminar and very dry reading some of his students like robert diltz write alot better books"
5,How to be a better communicator,"I have read people's mixed responses to NLP and comments on Amazon about Richard Bandler's background. Fine, approach NLP and hypnosis with some healthy skepticism. However, say what you will, let me quote one tiny paragraph of the book: ""We have found that there are three major patterns in the behavior of every therapeutic wizard we've talked to- and executives, and salespeople. The first one is to know what outcome you want. The second is you need flexibility in your behavior... The third is you need to have enough sensory experience to notice when you get the responses that you want. If you have those abilities, then you can just alter your behavior until you get the responses you want."" Brilliant. I got it. I can do that and it has helped me tremendously. This simple advice explains to me, why in spite of criticism, this book offers a practical guide to communicate with, build rapport with, and influence people."
5,Heat Wave (1990),"An outstanding and extremely underrated film about the 1965 Watts Uprising. Brilliant performances by Cicely Tyson, James Earl Jones, Blair Underwood and Glenn Plummer. Top notch writing and visual storytelling that is compelling, enlightening and even quite humorous at times. At long last an important movie about the African-American experience that s told from an intelligent African-American perspective!"
3,Curiosity,Bought this book out of curiosity. Haven't read it yet lent it to a friend that is an OT with children with various disabilities.
2,Outline of History by H Wells,Quality of the scanning was occasionally unreadable which detracted seriously from value of this book. . Interesting background on early days of Christianity.
2,CAUTION! 2nd volume only!,"This is the 2nd volume. I didn't find the 1st volume anywhere. And the reproduction quality is also not great, especially at the bottom of almost every page. But, to be honest, that doesn't upset me. The real problem is that I felt cheated, because nowhere in the title of the book or in the description it's said it's only the 2nd volume. I think Amazon is not to blame in this case, but the publisher could have described it better."
4,Roman British History,"I really enjoyed this book. I have always been interested in this period of British history. This book is too scary for young children: I would not recommend it for a child less than 10 years of age. The Outcast is a Roman boy, found nearly dead on a beach after a shipwreck, fostered by a Celtic family. He is thrown out of his tribe when a series of misfortunes convinces some in the village that they have offended their gods by harboring a Roman. Going to the Roman village, he is captured by slavers, and a truly horrible four years as a slave begins. The book reveals the Horror That Was Rome, when we have too often heard only of the Glory."
2,Okay book,This book wasn't what I expected. It has several people and their homes that I have never heard of. Just not enough detail about the people you have heard of. I think there are better books out there that deal with the same subject. It was kind of boring. I know I skipped through several parts of it.
5,Good product,The cable is just as advertised. I have had no problems with it and recommend it if you are looking for a male-to-male USB cable
3,GOOD CABLE bad Gender,"Cable was as described, got here FAST! But, oops I screwed-up........ Needed M/F . Should have checked further."
1,wrong cable,This cable was listed with the Canon scanner that I purchased. The cable is not compatable with the scanner and is of no value to me. The only positive thing that I can say is that it was cheap and arrived on time
3,Deserves more credit than its current rating,"I found this book to be alot more useful than another review I have read on it.The book is a good reference book showing very clearly in illustrations and instructions what you have to do to achieve the feature you wish to use in Photoshop and is very good at doing so. The book also packs every feature that Photoshop has to offer.This book would be well suited to a person that likes to learn by taking a digital image on their PC and following the well written instructions to achieve the desired effect you want to achieve for that photo.HOWEVER, having said this, the book is not a textbook with exercises to practice your skills and is does not inspire you to get stuck into Photoshop and enjoy indulging in creativity.In other words, as the title suggest it is a very good ""How To Use"" book (i'd give it 5/5 for that), but not great at teaching you how to be creative with Photoshop"
5,Fit the bill. And they're quite pretty :),"I wanted these for an art project, but the function of these is as striking as the form. Nicely matched gears."
5,Loose Watercolor,"Honored to have this in my watercolor library. Actually, just bought one of his originals."
3,Wish the title was true . . .,"Ok, so this book will not give you any secret that will get rid of your morning sickness, so don't buy it with that exectation. Do buy it if you want to learn some coping strategies and get some comfort from the author, who is clearly a sympathetic person who understands what youre going through. The book was worth getting for me since she mentions that some women develop lactose intolerances during pregnancy, and that bit of knowledge very helpful."
1,Very disappointed customer,I purchased a used cop of this book for my pregnant daughter. When she received the book - it smelled of mothballs which immediately caused her to become sick. What seemed to be a good idea turned out badly. I will not trust any future used book purchases with Amazon as they have no quality controls in place. A disgusted customer.
5,Perfect for my job,I do have 2 other spark plug sockets but I was not happy with them. This Kastar S28 3/8-inch drive magnetic spark plug socket is much better and more reliable to hold spark plug inside the socket.
5,The Magnet Holds the Plug Just Right,"This magnetic wrench works so much better than my old one with a sponge rubber insert. Each spark plug in my Honda Civic is at the bottom of a deep, narrow well, so I have to use an extension with the wrench. The problem with my old wrench is that its foam rubber insert holds the plug too tightly. After tightening the plug, I have to pull so hard on the extension that the extension unsnaps from the wrench before the wrench can let go of the plug. This leaves the wrench stranded at the bottom of the well (how I got the plug tightened AND got the wrench out is a long story). But with this new wrench, the magnet holds the plug securely enough, but is not excessively strong. I can get the wrench off the plug by pulling on the extension.This wrench appears to be well-built and durable. One of the other reviewers said that the magnet in his wrench came loose. Mine seems secure, but I put a couple of drops of super glue on the edge of the magnet just to play it safe."
2,To cheap material,"To start the casing is to weak, It won't last long for what it holds. Plus the product was made in china. These drill bitz either bend or break asap."
4,Delta Force is a different type of Special Forces Unit!,"Overall this was a very good book to read. Charging Charlie Beckworth tryed for years to start a unit in the US Army that was the same as the SAS. But the not so smart officers above him in the army didn't like it. Delta Force is the best Special Ops Unit in the United States. If it wasn't for a bunch of poorly trained pilots, they would have pulled it off! At least something good always comes from something bad. Just get the book and read it for yourself."
4,"Good book on the unit, but Haney's is better...","I really enjoyed this book. It gives a great history of the formation of Delta Force, but if you are only going to read one book on the subject; INSIDE DELTA FORCE by Eric Haney is much better. That said, this book is a page-turner and well written. There's a bit of self-congratulation; but Beckwith was an impressive individual."
4,Good military memoir,Good telling of the life story of a legendary man. I've seen Beckwith's name cited in several other special forces histories and it is great to hear from the man himself.
5,The best laid plans...,"A fascinating example of how the best laid plans for military operations can be altered and undermined - to the extent of being doomed to fail - by personality clashes and turf wars within and between the services. (One would like to believe that the military learned from the failure of the mission described here in detail, but I wouldn't bet the ranch on it.) This is also a telling examination of leadership, and as such can be read profitably by those whose interests are not primarily military related (e.g.,by those in the corporate world)."
4,Great Military History,"This is a well written book about the formation of Delta Force and the crucible of infancy. I found it informative, with great background in the reasons and struggles to get the unit off the ground and into reality. It wasn't intended to detail training or tactics, so don't expect that, but enjoy."
3,A little disappointed,"Like the last reviewer, I carefully inspected the cover and it made no mention of music. I was disappointed to hear any at all. It's true that it's fairly unobtrusive, but I was looking forward to water sounds, wind in trees and perhaps the occasional wildlife sounds, not music.I'll keep looking."
4,Something unusual in surf sounds,"Amidst all the temperate zone surf recordings, this one adds a very distant steel drum band, just on the edge of audible, and an occasional jungle bird. Occasional -- it does not sound like someone threw pakalolo seed in the aviary, but realistic, like the jungle next to the apartment I used to live in. I don't use these for sleeping, but for mood and to drown neighborhood noise while I work. This one feels warm and sunny."
5,I agree! Best Surf CD Ever!,"I've had this CD for about 10 years and it is one of my favorites. I am a big fan of steel drum bands so I love the sounds of the band; it's as if I'm on an island and they're off in the distance. The bird, surf and musical sounds are very calming with no jarring noises. I listen to this as I drift off to sleep; especially in the cold winter months. Anytime I have a miserable cold or just want to think positive, warm thoughts, I put on this CD and drift away. Love it!"
2,Good lasting Shine But....sprinkles black dots in your paint,The Product is i good and has a nice shine but you have to apply a considerable amount...and lasts a good week! but it does stick to the tire very well. I dont know if it splashed black sprinkles in my car because i was forced to use a considerable amount or if the product just do not stick well to the tire. either way I probably will not use it again!
3,Not as advertised.,"First off, it's advertised as white, but in actuality it's more of a beige color; not a big deal, but seriously, just advertise it as its right color. Secondly, the joints to the gate are plastic. Now why they are made out of plastic, I have no idea, but it's a horrible one. This is supposed to keep my dog in a specified area and the joints are plastic? They easily snap in half, which happened twice with me. Also, if you still want to order this item after my review, just know that my dog learned how to climb over the gate using the horizontal bar that's above the mini gate as a stepping stool to get over. All-in-all, awesome price, because it was cheap, but there are several reasons why it's so cheap."
4,Works great!,"This gate is flexible and sturdy, it works great to keep our dog contained where we want him."
2,Another reason to avoid this,I agree with the earlier reviewer and I'll add another reason: For $18.00 you can buy an electronic version of the Standard from ANSI as a PDF file. Same content (except the TR which I think is available separately) and no issues about binding. It won't feel like a book but somehow I doubt that Programming Language Standards are read at bedtime with a cup of cocoa at hand...
4,Good for kids or beginners.,"The magnets are really strong. However, the flights are a conical mesh with a totally different feel than a regular dart. That being said, there are no holes in the walls as there would be with regular darts. That's huge. I only gave the durability a 4 because we haven't had it long enough to judge the durability. It seems well made. The replacement darts are about as much as a whole new game, so keep track of them. I'd buy this again or give it as a gift."
1,Not happy with it,"I have used similar product before and it was fun. However this one is not with the same quality, the dart can barely stay on the board if you throw it from two meters away. More than half of the time the dart will simply bounced back and fall to ground. Even it stays, it shifts a lot. You have no idea where the dart will actually stays at."
3,the darts are too cheap.,I like the board. but the magnetic darts are not much good. the plastic guide's are not put in straight. I would not recommend this product.
5,Wonderful book! Great depiction of a brave hero...,"This is one of my favorite books! From Theseus' charming nature, to his adventures with Pirithoos, to the passion between him and Hippolyta, this book was beautifully written. Having hardly known anything about Theseus, this book got be completely obsessed with ancient greek history. It portrayed the Greek culture in eloquent words, and showed me how people lived. Mary Renault truly shows her talent in this book. What a novel!"
3,"Too short for 24"" stud walls","The product is well-designed, with one very major problem -- the mounting bar is only 23 1/2"" wide. This is okay if you have an older home with 16"" stud spacing on your walls (the pairs of pre-drilled mounting holes accommodate 16"" spacing), but much modern residential construction has studs 24"" on center. To use my unit, I had to use a drill press to make new holes at the extreme ends of the mounting bar, and then angle long deck screws into the studs. It worked, but this was far from an ideal installation."
4,An interesting tale of obsession...,"Bruce Dern is downright creepy in this. Maud Adams is sexy, beautiful and makes a great victim. Tattoo artistry forms the backdrop for this otherwise garden-variety tale of obsession. Something very Psycho about this film. Will take you someplace you've probably never been."
2,The e-boat book from vangaurd,"The book was fine, the history of the german schnellboots was very interesting. I was hoping for more photographs of the boats. I was hoping to use this book for building an e-boat model, but the limited photo supply was disapointing. If you want some history than the book is fine. If your looking for photo references this is not the book for you."
2,A Few Laughs But An Overall Dissapointment,"Stranger with Candy was a good TV show but didnt translate well into a movie. The story line was stupid like the show but stupid is the word to remember here, not funny. The movie was a bit painful to sit through and felt like it dragged on about an hour too long. It was cool that they got a lot of the original cast to rejoin for the movie, but the magic just wasnt there."
4,"for heaven's sake-it's ok, not horrible!","Granted, it's not as good as the TV series. But, it does give us a chance to watch most of the old crew in action and they make a pretty good run of it! It certainly has it's moments (the joint-smoking freak out floored me!!) and it's nice to see them having fun again. ""We all want to be homecoming queen"" and we all wish they had made a movie a little more like the tv series but it's fun just the same, makes ya laugh and I appreciate them doing all the hard work to deliver it to us!"
3,Ehhhh...maybe I should have gone with Crayola?,"I purchased this set because the picture showed that it came with two brushes. Two brushes, it did not. I complained to customer service. They were sort of helpful. You should know that the yellow brush doesn't exist. The eight colors are just okay. I could have gotten more for my money with a Crayola set. Next time?"
1,they don't last,"Although these were a BIG hit with my three-year-old, the paints lasted about 10 paintings, or three painting sessions. It was so disappointing for my little guy, as well as for me. I always think of Melissa and Doug as selling high-quality stuff, but these paints are an exception for sure. I've heard that Crayola makes better paints so I plan to try those. Soon!"
1,Don't bother buying this product,"I have nothing good to say about this product. Like some other reviewers noted, the colors are very pale. The most disappointing thing, however, is the fact that the case contains hardly any paint at all. My 2 year old spent 15 minutes ""painting"", and managed to finish several of the colors in that short amount of time. What a complete waste of money."
4,An essential addition to a Japanese bookshelf,"While I was living and working in Tokyo I was given this book as an essential. It is. No other book is as clear on ""stroke order"", an essential part of writing kanji. Without this, Japanese people will instantly see that you have ""drawn"" the character, rather than ""written"" it, and will laugh at you. Though not a tutorial, no Japanese language reference shelf would be complete without it. Mine is a well worn 1961 edition."
2,"A very limited dictinary, not a guide. Read on for better ..","Twenty years ago this was an OK book, but life and Japanese learning texts have fortunately moved on.Kenneth Henshall's ""A Guide to remebering Japanese Characters"" on the other hand is a real beaut, buy it, enjoy it, remember the characters!Gambatte ne!"
1,Don't buy if using Vista or Windows 7,"Software doesn't work on Vista or Windows 7. Installed update 2.9 and still didn't work. The software will sometimes install but not Run. The Keyboard Wizard operates. But that's it. Works on Windows XP but it has a lot of quirks and buggy system errors and stalls. Sometimes while installing you would get ""theory video will not open"" and the software will not install or crash.It seems like a good program judging from the videos online, but if you are a novice at computers, don't waste your money. If you try to email customer support for help, you will only get a basic auto suggestion on how to fix the problems."
1,Not a QTC85 Equivalent!,"The Electrochem QTC85 is 1"" in diameter.This part is 1.25"" diameter, and doesn't fit."
3,"Not quite as colorful as picture, eye was made of paper & glued, fell off when packaged open. Tail fin is frade","eye was made of paper & glued, fell off when packaged open. Tail fin is frade will unravel in wind."
1,Brotherhood of What?,"I am a vampire freak, but this movie is not cool. And if somebody doesnt find this review helpful, lets make a real movie. Contact DeathWishStar at hotmail.com"
2,MOVIE IS OK BUT,I DID NOT THINK THAT THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE KIND OF INTERSTING TO SAY THE LEAST. MEN IN UNDERWEAR AT THE END NOT SO GREAT.
2,Bright colors but hard to erase,"Make sure the marks have dried completely before you try to erase them, or you will leave dark smudges all over your whiteboard. Even when dry, marks do not erase completely. I will probably stick to the regular markers from now on and steer clear of the low odor ones."
2,"Good story, poorly written, in dire need of an editor",What could have been an exciting three generation story of three actresses is hampered by too much useless detail and too many cliches. A good editor could have made this story much more readable and praiseworthy. I was attracted to the book because of its settings in Hollywood and Israel. I finished the book because of the story line.
5,Forbidden doors for young adults,"These are very well written and I strongly recommend them. I am 11 years old, but an advanced reader, and I like them. They are astonshing and you really get deep into them. If you are an adult, teen, or an advanced preteen, I suggest you read this book. Suspense, horror, mysterys, thrills!"
2,not very sturdy,"I'm a contractor and have a slew of levels and really like this company, however the things that make this level so ""nice"" are the factors that make it a bit flimsy... it bent as I was taking it out of my truck! It didn't bend on the straight edge side (the side you use with the bubbles), it bent sideways. Strangely enough, I was able to ""bend it back"" in place and it seems to work fine (I checked it againtst my other levels) but I guess the fact that it is so long and light (the ""good"" things about it) are the same things which make it so weak. Anyway, I thought it was unusally inexpensive and that may explain it. I wouldn't [try to] return it as it arrived in good condition and it was my fault it bent - just be aware how gently you must use this tool."
2,Scary,"My two year old loves Little Bear, but this video was too scary for her. She had me turn it off when they were running from the golbins. She did not like the scarecrow either. It's to bad that they couldn't have made it a little more fun."
5,60 years old but still a gem,"This book celebrates its 60th birthday this year but it's difficult to top it for the most straightforward, comprehensive overview of the curriculum process. There are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by Tyler, in part if not in whole. The style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that Tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. The best modern book on curriculum is by John Biggs (""Teaching for quality learning at university"") and he pays tribute to the influence of Tyler's book on his own work. Unfortunately Tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read ABOUT but few have actually read. Do read it - it has pearls of wisdoms for today's educationalists or for anyone interested in schools and what they do, and it is only 128 pages long!"
2,Great Premise....no staying power,"Giant obelisks of an unfamiliar form of matter sent from 20 years and three months in the future to the past to announce great military victories of a messianic leader named Kuin. These obelisks have the annoying tendency to obliterate great cities like Bangkok and Jerusalem. Wow! What an imaginative start to a story.Whoops. That's all you ar going to get. Nothing more happens. No character development. No plot development. Some wierd little diatribes about anti-smoking laws, gun control, pacifism and custody issues. There is a twist at the end that was obvious, oh, about two hundred pages earlier."
2,"Pretty Good Writing, Pointless Story","I tried to read Darwinia, an earlier novel by this author, and put in down due to its inability to interest me in what was a most intriguing plot. Chronoliths was much better written, but the ending left me cold and disappointed. Why this novel was chosen as a ""best book"" is beyond me. There are much better sci-fi novels and collections out there, you just have to look harder to find them."
5,Excellent book for learning at a quick independent pace,"I'm really quite impressed with this book. I felt very comfortable with the language very quickly. The only thing was the tape wasn't available with the book when I purchased it, so I missed out on all the pronunciation exercises which are really very important when learning a new language. But I subsequently went to the associated website and downloaded all the relevant mp3 files.Would absolutely recommend this product. I'm looking to use it to learn Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Twi later on."
4,German Vocals as Modern Day Soma,"This is the kind of kick-back music you play when you're lying in bed in the middle of a weekday watching the work world run around like crazy outside your window. At least that's what I feel especially when I listen to ""Die Anderen"". It's calm and playful."
4,Good ramps.,"Good ramps for the price. Use them for changing the oil in my wife's SUV. Grip the tires well but do move just a bit when first pulling onto them, which was a bit un-nerving the first time."
5,Great For The Young Star Wars Fans!,"I read everything I can get my hands on that has anything to do with Star Wars. Yes, even kid's books. I liked this book a lot, because the untold stories are even better thn the movies."
3,A charming women,"Mary Nisbet was the definition of an aristocrat. She lived a life most people dream of: She was good looking, charming, intelligent, extremely wealthy, and was admired and respected by some of the most powerful people around.So what will you get out of by reading this book? Your be put into the shoes of Mary Nisbet and her extravagant lifestyle. Your get to know her spendthrift husband and his preoccupation with marbles from Parthenon. But really not much else.The book is based off of Mary's diary, which really helped give the book life.So, I'm giving the book 3 stars because the book was written fairly well, but the story was a little boring."
3,Who is Snowdon Parlette?,"I don't have a review, but was uncertain how to direct the question I have...which is, who is Snowdon Parlette? I searched for biographical info and found none. What I have read of the book thus far seems helpful and engaging, but I would like to know more about Snowdon Parlette (which I perceive to be a pseudonym) and his credentials. How is he qualified to draw these conclusions and write this book? I will submit an honest rating when I've finished the book and ascertained whether or not he has data to back up his assertions."
1,Is putting other dating books down just to sell yours...,... an example of how you date? I was searching for a dating book and came across a comment from this author in the reviews section of another book basically saying only her book is the correct dating practise. I was immediately turned off. Kind of like a woman that walks in and tries to steal your man because she can't get her own. If the book reflects this metality at all it isn't worth the cost for shipping none-the-less the cost for the book itself.
1,Don't take a chance,"The Taiwan built grill arrived on time (as everything from Amazon does). Assembly was streight forward and pretty quick as advertised on the Minden website. The grill burners initialy lit but went to very low flame within minutes. From there it would no longer light. I found the inlet hose was bent where it goes to the burners therefore not allowing propane gas to get to the burners. The design of this grill is very poor. In order to streighten the gas line out, I had to alter the cabinet. Sent three emails to customer service -- none answered.Unless you want to re-design this grill on your own -- stay away."
2,Dell Axim X51v ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protectors (3-Pack),"It is durable, but a bit too thick. Although Boxwave says they guarantee their products, they are very slow to respond to a request for an RMA number. I opened the first one and want to return the other two, and am still waiting for an answer. Not recommended."
5,Outstanding and delightfull,"Very simple, very plain and yet very delightful to read. I guess the beauty is in the simplicity withwhich the author present her case. Solid biblical background, what makes it even more delighteful to read. Righly recomend, not only for young folks, but also for the mature ones who could use some encoragement in their love life.Rev Paul Santos"
2,Emotional Purity: an Affair of the Heart,"The book was disappointing. First of all, it is not well-written. Second, it appears that she's propagating her own beliefs for which supporting research and convincing evidence is lacking. Her premise is valid, however, the way it is presented seems irrelevant in today's world"
5,Love the singing Goober bear!!!!,"This is one of the cutest toys I have EVER seen. His little foot moves with the beat, and when he sings, his mouth moves EXACTLY as it would if he were actually singing. The sweet little face melts your heart, and the message, along with his relaxed position, convinces you that you truly should not worry, and be happy. I can't imagine why they decided to stop making more, but that's what I was told by the company."
5,Great!,Item shipped as expected. In great shape and worth the cost.Husband was pleased with it. Thanks for helping make Christmas great!
2,"Great concept, poor execution","I've only had this Toshiba 2032SP from Sprint for a few days now, and I'm really regretting it already. It is a rather poor cell phone (speakerphone or wired mic/earbud ONLY - no option for holding the phone to one's ear), and a so-so PDA. The dim, powerhungry screen is shameful. The Toshiba 2032SP won't last more than about 36 hours on a full charge of this new battery. Horrible performance from a cell phone (and don't forget, this is a cell phone). The TFT screen is dim and fuzzy even at it's most intense brightness setting. At it's lowest, power-saver friendly setting it is so dim and illegible as to cause headaches. Despite the bulk, a full-featured PDA (iPAQ anyone?) and a well engineered cell phone (nearly any Motorola anyone?) are a far better option than this paperweight."
3,No Keys = bad concept,"Because this phone has no real keys, it is impossible to dial without looking directly at the phone. This is tough if you use your phone in the car. Even if you are on speaker phone; if you try to press a key your eyes must be off of the road. This almost put me into an 18-wheeler."
5,Just what I needed!,"I purchased this kit as a CNA student who was nervous about being tested on vital signs and wanted extra practice outside of class. I chose the purple set to keep it from getting mixed up with the classroom supplies. The stethoscope was much more comfortable in my ears than those provided by the school and I liked the pouch that made it easy to transport the B/P cuff. My only wish was that the stethoscope could somehow fit into the pouch to make it easier to transport in my book bag. Anyway, this was a wonderful kit and I passed my vitals on the very first try! Thank you for such a great product!!!"
1,"Not Bad, But Also Not as Good as Reviewed","This kit is OK, nicely fits under my car seat, good for light fishing.It would have been much appreciated had the rod been a bit stronger and more solid."
5,good product,had mine for about 5 years use it all the time at least once a month . if your only fishing in small lakes or ponds this is perfect you will not have miles of line with this pole it wasnt meant for that ive still managed to catch plenty of fish with mine and just recently broke a section (user error it was crushed by spare tire in the bed of my truck ) . it will catch respectable fish ive caught kokanee salmon walleye tons of rainbow and a few bass on this pole the case was the first thing to break no biggy it fits in my messanger bags spare compartment perfectly anyway . good product thinking of geting another one just to have around for freinds on hikeing trips etc
4,A Light Storm,"This CD starts with happy dogs barking in the background and birds singing. Then the birds fade as the frogs pick up thier song to welcome the increased humidity and the coming storm. The rain soon follows and I'll admit I was disappointed the first time I heard this CD as there is a decent amount of thunder. As a result, it's not really a great CD to sleep to (unless you love storms) but I do enjoy relaxing to it. I close my eyes and am taken back to the time when I was a kid growing up in the south, with the windows open (or partly open) on a rainy night. : ) I think the CD is worth having."
3,"A few good songs, but not the greatest",Highlights:1. Rock Your Body Justin Timberlake10. Big Yellow Taxi Counting Crows featuring Vanessa Carlton12. Stuck Stacie Orrico18. The Road I'm On 3 Doors Down20. Clocks Coldplay
1,Not Now,I have every single Now 1-10 but starting at 11 theres only a few real good songs. Now 13 is where this should end.

2,Came broken,"I've bought one for a present. Presented several days ago, it was broken, side was seperately. We fixed it with a glue, and now it is not comfortable to open it:(disappointed("
2,Much less here than meets the eye.,"I don't get it. What IS it about the Gettysburg Address that left-liberals like Wills find so profound? Do they somehow see it as some form of grand permission to expand the powers of government ad infinitum? This book contains some interesting historical background, some semi-interesting literary analysis, but does nothing to make the G.B. any more than what it is: a nicely written little dedicatory speech at a cemetery. It is not and should not be regarded as one of America's founding documents."
5,Written in stone.,"John Jerome is a compelling wordsmith. Though I've yet to read any of his other works, ""Stone Work"" is definitely the craft of a seasoned writer. He conveys his thoughts and feelings poetically, yet concisely; all ruminations have a drop of personal philosophy in them, yet are incredibly grounded in the day-to-day actions of laying a stone wall, living in the country, and being a writer. And therein lies the strength of the work - his ability to tell a story, paint a beautiful moving picture, and convince you of the veracity of his thoughts, as though you were there doing the work yourself. As an honest and beautiful portrait of a slower, more attentive life and the work to be done in it, this is a piece not to be missed."
3,A provocative book on a subject few have knowledge of.,"The book uses a question and answer method of writing which makes for a quick read. The questions catch your attention which make you want to read the answers.I learned a lot about money, the Federal Reserve and questions I would not have known to ask.The book could be improved on, in my opinion, by including some other authorities comments on the answers to the questions"
5,I Moved and Lost My Duster!,I am sure the new disposable dusters are fine. I just think there are a few too many disposable items in our lives and this product works wonderfully without any chemicals. I can dust my entire house and I may need to shake the thing out halfway through if it has been a while between dustings. Try this before you go disposable.
5,Sonic Mole Chasers DO Chase Moles,"The Sonic Mole Chaser REALLY DOES WORK but you have to follow the directions. You can't just buy one and think that will do it. The number needed will depend upon the size, composition and configuration of your lot. I have 1/2 acre lot that is heavily wooded and I have be plagued by moles for the last 20 years. I have tried everything else---commercial products: spring-loaded mole traps, mole bait, smoke bombs etc. and home remedies: Juicy Fruit gum and toy windmills. Nothing worked. Then I tried 6 mole chasers and I have not seen a mole in 5 years."
4,Worked For Us!,"We live on one acre and this item is really working great for us. We had a terrible problem with gopher mounds appearing nearly every day in our front yard very close to our front porch, but after using this product our problem is gone! I bought one of these for my husband for Christmas and he installed it in March so we have been using this product for nearly three months now. We are very pleased with this product and have ordered three more for the other areas of our property. We must remember where we install these though, because once the battery goes dead, they will be hard to find in the yard if looking with a hazy memory!"
3,Good,I changed el.supply to constant 6 volt suply using 220/6 Vadapter from the house. It has been working about one year. Result is good but success depends much of the kind of soil. With one I covered about 3000 sq.ft in sandy soil. No moles appeared any more in that area.Suggest produce some pieces ready for using with adapter. That would eliminate frequent change of the bateries and drop in the Voltage specially in cold weather. Connection by el. wires throug soil is very easy. Such a solution could give a possibility to decrease the size.
1,waste of money,"I have mounds as large as never before and just few feet from those devices. It looks like moles got excited with the ""music"" produced by molchaser and became more productive.Total waste of money. I have bought 2 from site that gives 60 day trial, will return them asap. Will see how that goes. Shipping costs lost anyways."
1,"SOLD A BILL OF GOODS, RIPOFF",Warning to all potential buyers! This product is a total farce. I bought four of these and placed them way closer than the required maximum distance. And yes I put brand new Duracells in these things. The moles actually burrowed right next to thems. Save your money and buy the old fashioned traps that actually kill the moles. These things don't work.
1,doesn't work,"We have a gopher in our small lawn and flower beds. I read the previous reviews and was dubious, but bought two of these noise makers, to make sure they covered the area. I followed the instructions and the advice people gave in their reviews to bury each of them down to the line and then packed the dirt down around them. Even after a month of use, they haven't chased the gopher anywhere. It continues to create new dirt piles.Because of the continuing problem, I have since read more about gopher control and the ""experts"" don't recommend these, but do recommend traps instead."
1,Our moles are no doubt amused...,"...by these silly devices and by our foolhardy belief in the hype that convinced us to buy them. We used them scrupulously, exactly as instructed, for two months. And the moles? There were new tunnels within a few inches of one of the Mole Chasers, just days after insertion. By the time we gave up, there were at least as many active tunnels as before. For our moles, at least, these devices were completely useless. Buy a kill trap and learn how to use it if you want to get rid of moles (e.g. Victor plunger style mole trap, available on Amazon).WOODSTREAM CORP #0645 Plunger Mole Trap"
5,rawlaw,A Cannabis tour de force! This is an instant classic - incredible photos and commentary :) Namaste :)
5,Who Killed Daniel Pearl ?,"The story of the death of Daniel Pearl, so shocking when it happened, is quite an amazing story on it's own, and would have been enough to read, but, the devotion of Bernard Levy taking a year out of his life to try and follow questions he had in his heart, is an amazing parrellel, story. I was very moved by how both of these men walked towards fear and kept asking difficult questions, when most of us would have turned (or more likely run) away."
5,THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AND NOT LET GO!,"THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AND NOT LET GO! Be prepared to read the whole book once you start because you won't want to put it down until you finish it!I met Michelle Whitedove when she was doing research for this book at The Lodge in Cloudcroft, New Mexico where I work. I found her to be a very exciting and intriguing person.Ms Whitedove has the uncanny ability to include you in the saga as you travel with her, so that you experience what she experiences as she travels from California to Louisiana visiting famed ""haunted places"" in Ghost Stalker. In many places you can feel the hair on your neck stand up as you participate in the adventure!I am very honored that Ms Whitedove saw fit to include my non-fiction short story, ""The Unruly Guest on Friday the Thirteenth"" in Ghost Stalker."
5,Messy to Neat Ignition Wires,I installed a Magncor 8.5 mm ignition wire set on my vehicle. It would not fit the separator on the vehicle which took the OEM 7 mm cables. I used this set to separate the Magncor set and it did a beautiful job. I have enough parts left in the kit to do at least two more vehicles.
1,"BAD PRODUCT, DREADFUL SERVICE","Although they say that one unit covers 9000 sq.ft., I put 3 units in my backyard, that is only 25' x 75' (only 1875 sq. ft). Even so, with 3 units, one month after I put the units in my backyard the moles are still really having fun on it.I tried to have support by e-mail but they never answered me.Then I tried to send a fax but the fax number was out of service.Then I called them. But allmost always a record machine answered my call. Then I left a message. But they never called me back.Finally once, a guy answered the phone but he told me it wasn't the support department but he didn't give me a support phone number.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL!"
4,so far so good,"There was a mole digging in my back yard. I had a solar power mole chaser, but pacific northwest winter is too cloudy to provide solar energy. I bought this one to drive the mole away,so far mole activity is gone. The build quality is so so, but it is acceptable given the price is cheap. It needs 4 D-size battery to work, not sure how long before I need to change batteries. It geneate a loud noise, but when I plug it deeper to the soil the noise is reduced.so far so good, I hope it can keep moles away for a long time."
2,loud and clear,"not sure if it works or not yet, but very sure I hear the noise, loud and clear. I gave it a 2 stars for now, but if it does work, I think it deserves a 4stars."
1,no activity since I installed - see update,With all the mixed reviews I was skeptical to order. I've been fighting these little !@#$%! for months now and they keep popping back up. For the price I figured this was worth a shot.It's been 3 days and no activity. This is a highly active area where I've even seen gophers in the morning hours. Keeping my fingers crossed. I'll post an update soon.
3,"OK, but not as good as PC version","Is missing a lot of the features from the PC version. The game is ok and easier to play for my son, as it is not as complicated, but boring for grown-ups."
1,Disappointed,"I should have done my homework before I purchased this game. It was very complicated and did not have the ""fun factor"" that other DSi game possess. The instructions for this game did not clearly guide you through the process of the game. I do not recommend this game at all."
5,Great Educational Gift,"I bought this for my younger sister. A great educational book, and she really enjoyed it. Perfect for any older child showing an interest in science."
5,DK Does It Right,I've always admired the books published by DK. This one is very cool. I think the big attraction with books such as this are the images. Great reference book to have if you are studying the human body or are into the science of nutrition.
4,Really entertaining,"Beautifully shot, intriguing and very entertaining. A little stilted, but the lead actors are so great, its still fun. Masterpiece Mystery tradition intact here."
3,Inspector Morse die-hard fans are just too picky,"Nothing lacking in this film (see headline, above). I have watched each episode of Inspector Morse at least once, know every furrow of his face, all the plot points and sub-plots. Shaun Evans is almost convincing as the youthful Morse; he is a fine actor, nuanced and believable.At times he reminded me of the mature Morse. That will have to do. Otherwise, an excellent plot and well played."
5,"Run, don't walk to get this book","I bought this book after reading about it in ""Popular Photography"". I have trouble thinking of an adjective that could properly describe this book.I found it very moving with poignant stories about the courageous photojournalists that gave their lives in pursuit of their art."
3,Soyo 32 inch LCD TV not bad......,I have owned this set since October 10th and I like the picture and the hook up was very easy to set up with my DVD player. The sound quality is very good. Up until today. I turned the set on today 11/28/06 and the tv is popping thru the speakers there is no sound from the dvd player just this horrible cracking popping sound. I have unhooked everything and rehooked it back up and the tv is still making this sound. I will try again tonight and I base my fair review on how the return process is going to be. Keep you posted.
2,Soft Science,I read this book shortly after publication. It seemed long on anecdotes and short on empiricism. It still does.The author included a web site to keep readers apprised of current developments. The site was never activated.
5,An Unforgettable Western Epic,"This is one of the best westerns I have ever read, right up there with McMurtry's ""Lonesome Dove,"" Guthrie's ""The Way West,"" Bergers ""Little Big Man"" and the works of Elmer Kelton. I strongly recommend it!"
3,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in my purpose. The print is small, the rules are sometimes insufficient and lack examples, and often when I am playing part of the screen disappears and I cannot continue."
4,enjoyed it,"I bought it because I wanted to understand the white side of the Austrian attack. The layout and text size is reader friendly and the suggested lines are easy to remember.Another interesting forcing line for white to play that is good for surprise value is the Chinese variation. 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.g4 h6 6.Be3 c6 7.h3 Qa5 8.Qd2 etcI combined it with a look at the Pirc in current tournament play, and tried it in some of my own ICC games.Worth buying."
5,That book is a show!,"That book is a show! Big! A little than John Buscema could do with a pencil. He was magic, as it was in whole its works. A book marvel to have and to consult whenever it is looking for inspiration. Wonderful!"
4,Daughter-in-Love,"I think the sequence where Lupe is talking with her mother-in-law an Idigeneous Mexican Indian was very moving. Finished the book on our way to San Francisco were we visited our daughter-in-love"" and our son and grandchild. Have been struggleing with the ""Thirteenth Sense"" all my life, and if I can't make it on a beautiful barrier island on the Gulf of Mexico, with my husband of 37 years, there is no hope for the rest of us. Buying the book for Christmas gifts to give all the people who give meaning to my life. Beautifully written and with such sensitivity it makes you want to invite Victor for dinner."
5,Fellow author bought it for its title but loved it...,"I wrote ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"" which came out at about the same time as this. Ordered it just out of curiosity because the titles are so close, and loved it. Perfectionism is foisted upon us at an early age in todays society, permeates the tean years, and persists through schooling and beyond. Those who seem to go further than the perfectionists ironically are those who seem to ""not care"" but instead live by internally set priorities and not for the outside approval of others. Reminds me of the line in a Joe Jackson song ""pretty women walking with gorillas down my street"". Self confidence is so much more important than outside kudos. The book expressed this so well...May I suggest ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"" as a general companion book to leading a brain-healthy perfection-free lifestyle...All the best to Dr. Curnan...Kenneth Giuffre MD, author, ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"""
3,"ok, not great for the price","this is the fastest card out there.. but the price is also the highest. price per performance is not good. If you have a high end card already, don't buy this, it will only be a small step up. you might as well wait a little longer for the brand new GPU core to roll out. The fan seems to provide better circulation.. but you r case will be more cramped with this two slot card. I would rather buy something in the $400 range. I use WhoSave.com to find deals."
3,What Evolution Was,"Although it might be a good introduction for beginners, the views presented by Mayr have a feeling of 80s and 90s. Mayr does little to include the cutting edge research in evolutionary biology and his vision for the future of evolutionary biology is at best short-sighted."
2,Where was the editor?,"This book contained a lot of good information, particularly in the emphasis on the individual as the object of selection, and a very clear explanation of the two-step process of evolution (chance generation of variation followed by selection).But where was the editor? There are obvious places where several alternative paragraphs were written and rather than chose the best one, all of them were printed! Some of the errors are humorous, for example, ""I [the author] recognize seven classes of restraints"" followed by eight numbered paragraphs! There is a refutation of the claim that ""morphogenesis"" is contrary to Darwinism, without any explanation of what ""morphogenesis"" is. The first 5 chapters are almost impenetrable to the lay reader, containing much arcane jargon. The glossary is only occasionally useful.I think it's a shame that a highly respected authority in the field would be so ill-served by his publisher."
3,"Seen it before, yet still find it compelling","I won't reiterate the other reviews, they are pretty much on target. We have seen a lot of the style of this film, which take several seemingly at first disparate storylines and manage to tie them together as the story continues to its conclusion. Most effectively done in Quentin Tarantino's films as well as Greg Marcks' ""11:14"". As far as teen/young adult boredom and angst comes into play the film ""Over The Edge"" also comes to mind. While many of the characters are unsympathetic and make bad choices, I still find the overall trials and tribulations of the characters somewhat compelling. A good film, not great, but worth viewing."
4,CAN Open Book,"This is an excellent book. If you are implementing CAN Open for your Embedded Processor / System then you will need this.Also bear in mind that you should get the CIA spec (it is free), but this book describes all the aspects that you need, particularly the Object Dictionary."
1,Rough Shape.,This book was highlighted and not in good shape. The pages were folded. This was a bad experience. Overall Disapointed.
1,BLEEERGGGHHH!!!!!!,"Please, every person in the world...don't think this mediocricy represents the brazilian music...this is horrible, with totally childish lyrics and an absolutelly identical sound...all the songs seems the same, and all are boring...terrible, this kind of crap can destroy an person brain in seconds...beware!"
4,What about the music?,I recommend the wedding song for the new couple be the very special one in the book Defenders of the Holy Grail. It is in the scene where Katherine married Reed.
3,Multiple personalities in one body,I have never read a book that handled the theme of multiple personalities as well as this. The woman in the story is tasked with destroying or subverting a foreign computer network. The problem her handlers are not aware of is that the GodHeads are just ecstatic to have her join them. You are unaware of almost all the nuances until you have reached the last part of the book. You truly are in the dark as to what is going on and what is at stake.The only major drawback to the book is that the main character(s) are never in any form of control. The ending is a little weak as well.
2,zen floor lamp,"This lamp is beautiful, once it's together. I didn't realize the panels were plastic, and I thought it would look really cheap, but you can't tell. The only problem I had with this is that I ordered walnut and received black. Also, there was a gash on the wood."
3,better value elsewere,"Surface rust on steel mounting flange, just not a good quaility product giving the specs of capabilitys and cost. Any one looking for larger or limited avaiable hydrolic fluid needs may find it thru Baldwin applications. My Japan made, Kubota dealer list, was better quaility and less cost."
5,culmination of Human mind,"Ocean: Wings to fly your soul of your humanity The words cannot describe my feeling after the time finishing another swim in my oceans of questions. Ocean is the best! On it is not appropriate term. When the nothing like to compare the meaning best is worthless. It deeps you. It is space sheep that guide you, when it was nothing you wont loose your way. It prologues with warning, It decays with crashing, It ends with agony of the genius."
2,Forcing reality into a pre-conceived box,"While the book reviews interesting insights about the stability of ecosystems and emphasizes that most preconceptions are invalid in one or another circumstance, it pushes a preconception of its own that is so abstract as to be nearly meaningless. Phenomena are forced into phases of a model even when the fit is unreasonable. The book reads as though the editors fell in love with a nice idea - and a pretty diagram - and proceeded to ignore subtleties and refinements that, if incorporated, could have had real value. One significant flaw is that the wasteland of a devastated ecosystem, such as an overgrazed scrubland, is conceived as the 'same' ecosystem as the mature one (rainforest) that preceded it, and that a 'cycle' will bring it back around - and this in contradiction to the book's own opening chapter. Some redemption is achieved by authors of later chapters, who do not fall into these traps."
3,Good but included too much,"I gave this book three stars because I felt that the editors were applying the kitchen-sink approach to this book and were trying to fit the theories of resiliency to encompass all political, cultural, and societal behavior as well as ecological processes. Much of the other material I've read about resiliency is strictly applied to ecology and I think that, by taking a broader approach, the editors of this volume dropped a large group that may have otherwise subscribed to the resiliency theories of sustainability.With respect to ecological processes and sustainability, much of the initial material in this book deserves five stars. It's just when people who have backgrounds in aquatic ecosystems and economics start getting all sociological and psychological on me, they lose me as an audience member."
5,Good for toddlers,"These crayons are good quality and the hard plastic case is nice. However, after reading a previous review I had high hopes that these crayons would solve the eatting crayon issue but, unfortunately, these crayons are just as tasty to my son as regular crayons."
2,Ehh,This book was recommended by the Gestalt Therapy Institute in California. I suggest that you don't buy it. I thought think that there are better books out there that explain the same crap in a simple manner. If you are more advanced you may prefer but if you are a student or beginner don't bother. Even if you are advanced the book sucks.
1,Linear story disguised as module written in tournament style,"I must disagree with Michael Varhola's gushing review of this module. But then my palm isn't being greased by TSR or Cordell. I read the entire travesty of an adventure. It's a not an adventure, it's a prolouge. Linear as heck, no getting of the set path. Characters move in a straight line from one encounter to the next. I really wish TSR would find some people who could write adventures that AREN'T in a tournament format. Give the players some freedom of choice for once. Stop treating us like little kids who must be led around by the hand(nose). While we're at it, TSR should stop churning out these politically correct, sanitized, lumps of pablum marketed as adventures."
4,Sweet and Heartwarming,"I'd never heard of Elizabeth Keys, so out of curiosity I thought I'd give Reilly's Law a try. While somewhat different than I expected from the back blurb (thought this would be more paranormal), I was plesantly surprised with the writing and the story. Emmalynne and Bryan were honorable and sensitive characters. While I would have liked a bit more friction and sexual heat between these two, the bad guy added enough spark to get me to the end. The message of trust, love and family is sure to please many."
3,AMA Encyclopedia of Medicine,"This book needs an update. It's too old, the information is outdated. I tried to locate an updated version but none was found. If you can recommend a more current reference like this I would like to know about it. Thank you."
2,This Book is Too Old,"I didn't realize that this book has not been updated since its copyright--1989. The date of information probably is 1988 or earlier. While this book is clear and well-organized, anything that's 14 years old has little credibility with me. I feel that I made a mistake in getting it."
5,Intriguing! Good information,I found this book intriguing. It gave me a great look at how to treat others. We really need to listen to what others say. We need to know how to respond. I love the written and the play on words. Excellent writing.
5,A must !,Chick Corea at is best. Impressive virtuoso. Avishai and Ballard perfectly tuned. Three genious.Highly Recommended!
5,Great movie!,One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies. Wish I could have gotten one with a digital copy and DVD combo though.
4,from a marine,"a lot of the other reviews say clint over did the gunnery sergeant role, i disagree as a marine myself he did an outstanding job as a lifer gysgt that believes in the marine corps. he believed things should be as the corps meant them to be, the men should be discipline now as they were in bootcamp. times change not the corps or its values so he whipped his men back into that shape using whatever it took including whipping their butts. the language was realistic people do use that language in the corps sometimes thats the only thing young knuckleheads hear. its not always needed but some older men like gunnys use it to prevent using their hands this is an awesome movie. my favorite is calling for fire with a credit card call to the camp lejeune operator, you try this today youll get a recording press 1 for this press 2 for that.GUNNY HIGHWAY reminds me of one of my old gunnys."
4,Pure Clint,"A good picture of the Marines, idiots, and base town life. Loved the film, Clint, Mario, and the crew there."
5,A very good example of Clint Eastwood's acting ability.,I found this DVD with Clint Eastwood was very special. He has always amazed me with his talent and knack of being able to actually become the character he is playing. In this DVD he shows how making the right decisions are not always easy but in difficult times you have to and he allows the viewer to actually know how he feels. I highly recommend this as a collector's DVD to be kept and viewed now and again.
3,classic worth rewatching,"Worth rewatching, if only to hear Clint Eastwood's one liners. PQ not that much of a step up in Bluray, AQ also so-so. Worth buying if u dont't have it in DVD. A bit corny though, watching it after all these years."
3,"Dismissed by too many as one long non-stop 'cuss-a-thon', but...","Clint Eastwood looked fit and fan-tastic here, @ age 55 as the sortofover-the-hill Marine-in-his-last-Tr.that many didn't notice that thismovie took longer to play out thanthe ACTUAL invation of Grenada thatit portrayed. Everitt McGill and M.Gunn (Shaft, others) are outstandinghere as well. As for Marsha Mason (isshe one?), ""Goodbye, Girl."""
4,DVD,"This is a long time favorite. I am an avid Clint Eastwood fan, and this one doesn't disappoint. I like the 'going home' and 'losers-to-winners' stories. Lots of great lines and a love story to boot. The late President Reagan said it was a favorite, as well. Worth the time!"
3,Total Football - A Total Mess,"Total Football is one big mess. Take a look at the Player Register - how do do find anyone?! Youhave to know that Joe Smith's first name is William - so he ends up between Walt and Wilson Smith! Then those stats - could they possibly bein a worst looking, jumbled format?1Good info - horrible format.I think I'll check out The Pro Football Encyclopedia."
4,"Not usually my thing, but...","I just picked this up one day at the book store because I was looking for something different. I was not disappointed. The Lieutenants was very interesting, and well written.This wasn't a ""page-turner"" where you just had to find out what happened next, but the characters and situations were so engrossing that it was a very quick read anyway. I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. I will probably read at least the next book in the series, if not the entire series.I would recommend this book even if you are not a big fan of military fiction, and if you are, then I'm sure you'll definitely enjoy it."
5,Start of a great series!,This is where it all starts. It's a great read with dialog that is so accurate its scarey. The attitude of the main characters reflects the feelings of the times. Historically its a fun and interesting book. It is well worth ones time!
3,"Does the Job, but Hat is cheap","The engineer's hat is quite cheap. It's a very thin material and the clasp in the back is the plastic kind that usually ends up breaking, making the hat unwearable. I cut this plastic piece off and stitched in a piece of elastic instead so that my child can easily take it on and off without the plastic clasp breaking or coming apart.The train whistle that came along with the hat is great. It's sturdy and a solid piece of wood. My 2 year old loves it...he's always pretending to be a train engineer."
2,Wrong Color,"I ordered this hat after looking all over for one that would match my son's striped overalls. When putting the picture of the hat next to a picture of the overalls they appeared to be an exact match. I happily ordered it as soon as I saw it. Unfortunately, the picture on the website is not accurate. The hat is actually much, much lighter. I'm definitely dissapointed."
2,Not the be-all end-all BBQ brush,"My experience with this brush is different than some users, apparently. The scrub pad on my Grill Wizard unravelled quickly and didn't do that great a job on its first or subsequent uses, either. And when it started unravelling, which was on the second or third use, it started leaving bits of the scrub pad on the grill. I would not buy this again or recommend it, and I'm sorry that I bought some extra scrub pads with the initial purchase to save on the shipping. The combination of Weber's ""regular"" brass brush and Weber's 21"" T-brush works much better."
2,Not so great...try another scrubbie?,"We also bought this b/c Cooks Illustrated recommended it. We were very disappointed. The scrubber comes apart when the grill is cleaned, leaving tinsel-like bits over the grill that have to be picked off before grilling again, or else it gets in your food. Also, the vendor charged quite a lot for shipping, and our order was mis-routed."
3,very informative,This book was very informative because it had dozens of different professionals contribute to each chapter. What I didn't like about the book was that it had a lot of jargon in it. The authors sometimes go into great depth on their subject and it made the reading difficult sometime.
5,Just like the characters!,"These figures were just like the characters! The set contains the charactrs played by Michael Madsen, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Tim Roth. They each have sunglasses and a gun. Madsen and Keitel have cigarettes in their mouths. Michael Madsen has a ""5 o'clock shadow"" and comes with a cup with a straw and a gas can (if you saw the movie...you know why). Buscemi has a black bag (which, in the movie, held the diamonds). These characters are very well made and look just like their characters! I cannot speak to their durability if played with, as this was meant as a collector's item."
3,humor - a difficult medium for learning spanish,"Humor relies on so much. Cultural,political and socialogical norms all have to be known in order to appreciate a joke. Throw in another language and appreciating jokes from other countries becomes that much more difficult. It would be better to have translated US cartoons.But it is still a welcome relief from some of the spanish resources."
1,Don't buy this!,"Thank goodness I just checked this book out of the library and didn't buy it! This book barely provides one helpful strategy, and instead is more about theories and case studies. In the foreward she mentions that this book is best read BEFORE you have a second child. Well, I have a feeling most people are not that proactive, and instead start looking for help once their kids start fighting and really struggling with sibling rivalry. Skip this book and find another one!"
5,Excellent book,This is an excellent introductory book for Sql Server Notification Services especially when time is a constraint in learning the technology. The author does an excellent job in explaining the technology and uses a sample notification service application for doing so. The book also comes with 2 bonus chapters and source code for the sample application that can be downloaded from the publisher's web site after registering the book!
2,Didn't tell me anything I didn't already know,"A confusing little book - from all the hype you'd think there was some earth-shattering discovery enclosed therein.But this was just a collection of little essays about the web, the contents of which would be so plainly obvious to every 12 year-old I know. Yet for an over-40 who'd never used the Web, they wouldn't understand it either. So who is the target audience?It doesn't even merit being considered as ""WWW Futures 101"". Very disappointing."
5,"Small Pieces, Big Story","I hope David Weinberger's book reaches a broad audience, not just because I consider him a great guy and a friend. He's on to a major story: this Internet thing is big, not because it puts shopping malls on our desktops, or because we can chatter till we drop, or trade quail egg futures in markets around the world. In weaving a new world within the void of our historical moment, the Web is less a tool than a response, in small pieces, to a wish we'd nearly forgotten we had. For too long, we've been dining on beastly thin cognitive gruel. The Net's unbelievable size, irreducible weirdness and uncontrollable energy reflects how starved we are for the smallest bits of madly inspired life. The above is taken from a review posted here: http://tom.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$891"
4,This collection comes off as something less than artistic.,"When dealing with photography of the nude, one must always be careful that he doesn't cross the line into pornography. Whereas Weston's photographs were great studies in form and composition, Newton's photographs show dolled up women, virtually always in high heels, and appear to have implants. The only thing that separates this from a playboy layout is that it's in black and white"
1,america is a sad place,"i've read this book as well as michael moore's, and michael moore's version of things meshes with my own experiences. i do tend to be a liberal being unfortunate enough to be both black AND female (with an education no less!) trying to make it in the academics/science worlds; and well ,this book is just attempting to cover the sores in america without treating it and healing it. this book is a truly truly sad example of how america insists on continuing to stick its head in the sand instead of admitting that there is a problem that they need to fix."
5,Cool!,This a really good book and I would reccomend it to any Star Wars because it gives an account of Han Solo's stay in Jabba's dungeon. It's cool how a B'omarr monk comes in and interviews Han on his journeys and adventures. A must have for any Star Wars fan.
3,Truth in Advertising,I was told that this was a hard cover book. It's not. Oh well. I'll give it to my kid's school library and continue to look for one for my home library.
2,On Mexican Time,I have lived in San Miquel and this is a good book on the city and the people. Things have changed a lot in the past forty years and we need another update.
4,The good and bad,"Having lived and worked in a town near San Miguel de Allende I enjoyed this book. It brought back lots of memories of the area and people. Being able to picture every city, street, and building that Cohan mentioned, since I have seen them all, helped to create wonderful imagery for me. I do think it is important to point out that San Miguel is really a tourist town. There are lost ex-pats living there and everyone speaks english and many times prefer english to espanol. Rich Texans take weekend vacations there and only the wealthy Mexicans can afford to visit a place so important in their history. (Many of my Mexican friends call it Saint Michael - because of all the Americans). In a way it is sad that Tony Cohan's book is good, because I think more people will visit San Miguel de Allende and the historic little mountain town will lose its magic. But at the same time the economy of San Miguel de Allende deeply depends on las turistas. I guess it's a Catch 22. Enjoy the book!"
5,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!,"This book is packed. If this is what they meant by minimalism, then they seriously underestimated minimalism. Or perhaps this is minimalism at its peak. Doesn't matter. Here's the book. Call the style anything but call the book unstoppably funny, wrenching to the bone, wise, and different from anything you have ever read."
3,A little expensive,It certainly seems to be potent. I did cause some itchiness at times. Not sure I'd use it again.
1,Yuck!,I love most Donald Pliner shoes. These were cute in the picture but ugly on the feet and not that comfortable.
4,good documentary,"i wish it had better views of the fingering positions but it was like a friend sitting with you teaching you guitar, very patient and down to Earth."
3,So-so.,"It's okay. The characters aren't terribly realistic, nor is the plot. If someone clubbed my mother to death, I'd be a tad more concerned than this heroine; one town doesn't have all the good folk or all the bad folk; and I don't believe that having an illegitimate child really prevented a frontier woman from marriage or even respect.The book is good for what it is, and I'd recommend it for a boring, rainy afternoon when a little foolishness and some suggestive passages could fill an hour or so."
2,Definitely Not Low Sodium!,"While Mr. Piscatella promotes a Mediterranean Diet with lots of fruit & vegetables, most doctors also recommend lowering the consumption of sodium. The receipes in this book, with exception of desserts, are considerably high in sodium even for a healthy heart. Most of the general information can be found easily at other sources."
5,"Amazing, hilarious book about the Oilfield","If you have never worked in the Oilfield and think the stories about the situation that happen are all just inflated, you will love this book. They are of actual events just told in typical oilfield fashion which make them even better. Great read and will leave you wanting more."
1,Disgusting!,I ordered these because the pill version makes me nauseous... this was no better! Holy moly was the taste soooo bad! I had one and I threw away the package.
2,:[,"I hear this gun is good, but then i found out.... it cannot be purchased in california. real big downhill part. So for you people who don't live in the states stated in the important information area, lucky you, for us unlucky fellers, :[[[[["
1,Sex and Blood,"If all you want is SEX and BLOOD, this is the book for you. If you are interested in plot and character development, choose something better. Ms. Hamilton's characters are pulled around like puppets by a series of bloody, mindless events. When she runs out of gore, they all jump into bed and have sex in excessively detailed ways. This is the first Laurell K Hamilton book I ever picked up, and I will not waste my time or money on any of her others."
5,Hamilton does it again,"After reading all of the other books in the Anita Blake series, I didn't think it was possible for Hamilton to add more spice to Anita's life. The triumvirate finally hits home and all hell breaks loose. I'll admit it isn't the best of the whole series, but it has that classic Anita Blake ""feel"" to it that draws me to reading the books over and over again. I hope that she writes another one, because I just can't get enough of Anita's twisted world."
1,Yuck and Yuck again,"I miss Anita. I miss her raising the dead, working out with Ronnie, sparring (verbally) with Jean-Claude, fighting danger. This novel goes in a sad strange direction that loses all the fun of the orginal few books. It needs more plot, less sex and more sex appeal. I had to force my way through this book, as I did through OB. Fortunately, I have the earlier books which I still very much enjoy reading over and over, because this is the last in the Anite Blake series I will read."
2,Boring....,"I have to agree with the other readers, this book was sooo disppointing, where is the Anita from the earlier books???The book has absolutely NO plot, JC is nothing but a shadow of what he used to be, Anita has lost her sense of humor and is transformed into a very arrogant and very tired woman. I loved the books untill Burnt Offerings but since then Ms. Blake has lost her appeal, because of the munin and now the dreaded ardeur she is most of the time so out of control that her personality is barely reconizable, I'll read Cerulean Sins but from the reviews I read I have no hope for this series."
5,Wonderful!! Can't Wait For The Next One,"I waited anxiously for this new Anita Blake novel..and I wasn't disappointed. Old friends and new faces take Anita on anothe wild ride through the city of St. Louis. I was a bit disappointed that Edward didn't show up at some point, but Ms. Blake had enough to deal with what with all the wereanimals and vampires to deal with. The aition of the werefox could have been left out a I don't feel he added anything to the plot of the story, but otherwise another great story by LK Hamilton..I couldn't put it dow!!"
1,What The Heck...????,"Is this an aberration or a ""new direction""? If its the former, glad to hear it. If its the latter, thanks its been fun but I'm done.You ever read a book and think....what was/is going on with this author that this book is the result? Thats how I felt about this book.Maybe its just me, but having your main character screwing around every chapter with another male with an enormous schlong and calling it ""characer development"" is laughable to the extreme.If you're a Jean-Claude or Richard fan, BEWARE !!! They are badly written, dumped on, and in the case of Richard, unbelievably mangled. Ah, but not to worry, Anita has a new instant soulmate, Micah. A character so flimsy and useless the most memorable thing about him is the size of his willy.You had me until this one Ms Hamilton...."
2,The weakest link.,"A huge step back for Laurell K. Hamilton, the newest Anita Blake novel seems to lack a lot of things.The character development we've all learned to love disappears into thin air when contradictions galore appear with old characters and new characters just seem to pop out with no back story. While it's fine and dandy to have Anita take a 90 degree turn in her personality, we as the readers want to see the turmoil happening. You don't just jump from point A to D without explaining B and C or putting some depth into the story. It ruins the moral climactic moments readers love.Bad guys are thrown into the mix sloppily so it seems like they were just attached onto the story for no good reasons. The plot is secondary to the all mighty sex, so we're left with a soft porn feeling. Most of the sex scenes sounded like they were recycled from the old books anyway. Sorry, if I wanted to read half a book full of sex scenes, I would have bought an erotica."
3,Narcissus a little self-absorbed.,"I think that I've read most if not all of Laurel Hamilton's Anita blake series books. The first few are outstanding works of fantasy/horror. Narcissus maarks the beginning of the mediocre anita blake books. at this point in the series Hamilton stops writing content and starts churning out mostly porn. Don't get me wrong, a litttle sex just adds spice to the story, but when most of a book is sex, I wonder if the author has run out of Ideas. At this point in the series, I'd reccomend that readers check the local library before investing in the book."
5,Loved it,"Obsidian Butterfly was such a sexual drought, that it made me appreciate Narcissus in Chains more. I prefer Anita when she is getting some because she seems to mouth off less; the endless poking at people far bigger/stronger just because she is a runt annoyed me last book especially. I was happy to have some Jean Claude and Richard back in the story, and think Micah was a good addition. I like all the new aspects introduced to her character as well. Can't wait to read the next one and wish the people who ""hate"" the books would stop reading them!"
4,narcissus in chains,I found this book to be very good though I was surprised at Richard's behavior he is not a good ulfric without Anita. I was glad she has met someone she seems to comfortable with and maybe able to really love.
1,This is my last Anita Blake...,"As I said in my one-star review of Anita Blake #9, Obsidian Butterfly, if the next book in the series wasn't better edited, I was done, done, done. So, here is #10, and it is even more poorly edited (typos, repetitive scenes, and overly-long descriptions - how many times do we need to hear about Nathaniel's ankle length hair?), but even worse, there was no story arc. Really, no plot...nada, none, zero. Anita moves from violent episode to violent episode, and from sexual encounter to sexual encounter (wash, rinse, repeat MANY times), but there is no plot to hook it all together. The final straw is the insertion of a whole new villian in the last few chapters! I won't be reading any more of the Anita Blake series, and, given that I couldn't get past Chap 6 of the first book in LKH's Merry Gentry series, it looks I'm done with LKH as an author."
5,AWSOME,"I can't believe anyone can say anything bad about this book! Sure it is a departure from guilty pleasures but totally in a good way. The last few books have been leading up to this so for those who say that this book hit them too hard than obviously you havent been reading the last few books. For anyone who reads at all, buy this book. I rarely ever give 5 stars on the books I read,I am a very critical judge of books, so that tells you something about this one."
3,"Not very good, but I kept turning the pages.","This is easily the weakest book in the Anita Blake series, and yet even the weakest book has the power to be a page-turning read -- even if sometimes you're turning pages in a desperate effort to get to some semblance of plot or action. There's far too much navel gazing, repetitive conversations, not-particularly erotic sex scenes, and arguments that don't seem to go anywhere. Ms. Hamilton needs to get back to the fun mysteries and intriguing plots that made this series such a success in the first place."
1,"I want the ""old style"" Anita back!","I absolutely love this series and was so excited to crack the binding on this newest edition. Unfortunately, it is pretty awful. Ms. Hamilton has abandoned the formula she used for the first 8 books, the formula that made me such a loyal fan. The writing itself is pretty bad and the characters are superficial and not terribly likeable. And why are all the guys skinny with long hair?! Please give the rest of us a man with another body type so we can stay interested too (Richard doesn't count anymore). I miss the police work. I miss her job as an animator. I miss the wit, the morality, the other characters I'd grown to love. I do sincerely hope the next book will be better than this one!"
1,What Happened!!,I started reading the series and fellin luv but in this book I really felt cheated. When I heard there was a new Anita Blake book comming out I counted down the days until it was out. And when i read it i was really disapointed. There is waaaaaaaaaay to much sex in this book what happened to anita's morals? And what is up with all this new magic stuff.LKH better make it up with the next in the series. I will still look for the next one
4,She Crawls Before She Walks,"True, at first glance there may seem to be differences in the book and Anita's character, but when you look at the pattern of the books you can see that Anita's power is always expanding and we as readers are learning with her the limits or lack thereof to her power. Certainly Anita acts out of character and does less than moral things in this book, but just as she needed training and practice to become a sure-shot and fast-draw, she will need to learn techniques to quell new desires and experience to bring fledgling abilities to second-nature skills. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt and that there could have been less sex, but overall I'm excited to see Anita to grow as a tough character and anxiously await the next installment."
1,Disappointment :(,"I really loved this series when I got my hands on it.It was gripping, and interesting. I couldn't put them down. I read each book and just couldn't wait for the next. That's what made it so hard to read the last few books. They became one big mess. Anita was no longer this strong, stubborn yet smart woman. Now, she's a horney know-it-all. I found myself rolling my eyes and saying ""oh come on"". It just became too predictable and trashy. So, needless to say, I will not be buying this disappointing trash anymore. So sad :(."
4,Narcissus in Chains,"...I am new to the Anita Blake world having discovered it in August. I enjoyed the book. I was not disappointed in any way except by Richard. I felt that this book showed a maturing Anita, I felt that it was time that she make some decisions in her personal life, it seems to be the one place she is not aggressive. I like Micah and and development of Nathaniel into asupportive person, and one who is not so needy. I will agree that there is alot of sex in this book, and that in some ways Anita is like Merry, but I think that Hamilton can still keep the characters seperate if she tries hard enough. I do wish that the books in the series would come quicker than once a year, but I guess that those are the breaks."
5,Don't listen to Nay-sayers!,"This book is absolutely worth the read! A bit darker than the previous books, but wonderfull all the same. I am definatly sticking with this series."
1,Getting Worse,"The glory of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books is, in my, view the toughness of the central character. She is the terminator, she doesn't give in, she doesn't stop and she never backs down. Added to this are the imaginative plots combining gothic fantasy and detective-noir.Ms. Hamilton's books have always had a strong element of the erotic. In her earlier books this element was pretty much under control and, indeed, usefully established the ""otherness"" of the world co-existing with our own. Unfortunately in this book, like her last, this element has been allowed to dominate, resulting in a sado-masochistic farce. Not only is this excess boring in itself but much of it is predictable - there are striking similarities between scenes in the last few books.A plea from a fan - drop the touchy feely stuff and please return to the hunter-killer mode and the imaginative plot lines."
4,pretty good,"I have never read any Anita Blake novels before and started with this one. A couple reveiwers are right about the repetitiveness of the wording in some parts. However, I have read a lot of vampire novels and this one is the most descriptive bar none but Anne Rice and she is the master in this genre. So if you are out to have an awesome, attention catching and sometimes perverse read, here it is!"
1,One angry and childish woman,"Maybe if I had read the other 9 books featuring character Anita Blake before this one I could get a better grip on just why this woman becomes violently angry in every other paragraph. In this particular book when she isn't having sex in some form or other with the main male characters, she's threatening to shoot them. I found the Anita Blake character and this book childish and rather melodramatic. Considering the subject line you'd have thought there would have been more meat on the bone as the saying goes but alas the was no real plot to follow unless the ardeur was to supply that also."
4,Anita Blake is a wonderful heroine,Laurell K. Hamilton gets better with each book. This one had a twist that I wouldn't have predicted as possible. A definite great read.
1,Last LKH Book I'll Buy,"Okay, we figured it out 5 books ago. Anita hates loving J.C. Anita is one tough cookie. Anita and Richard have unresolved issues. Something fairly new: Anita as a tramp.Consider these elements:1. Anita having sex with anything sporting the proper plumbing2. Anita whining about #13. Richard not happy about #14. Anita telling everyone around her how tough she is5. Anita / Richard / J.C. triumvirate not working outRemove these elements and you'd be left with a story that fit into 50 pages.LKH comes up with interesting ideas and unusual characters. It's too bad that her last several books have primarily belonged in the porno rack. It's not even GOOD porn, the kind that titillates -- it's just the kind you skim over, wondering when the story is going to start moving again.Come on, LKH, you can do better."
2,A Genuine Disappointment,"How is it possible for a talented writer to follow up one of the very best books in a series with one of the worst? It's baffling. I really wanted to like this book, but often found myself skimming through the seemingly endless (and humdrum) sex scenes and discussions of mysticism. There was very little action (internal or external), few captivating characters, and a sense that with this novel, Hamilton has decided to head in a new direction. Now, don't get me wrong...I often love it when authors veer off in new and exciting directions, but Hamilton's choices are neither.Reading this book was a lot like listening to a friend who has created all kinds of problems in their life, but refuses to make the choices that would be necessary to get their house in order. They whine and moan, and eventually you give up on giving advice or even listening. Laurell, I'm about to stop listening to Anita."
2,Stop with the kinky sex and emphasis on bodily fluids!,"I have read all of the books in the Anita Blake Vampir3e Hunter series. Each book had a new twist and a different type of enemy for Anita to face. However, I have noticed that with each book the sex gets kinkier and the emphasis on bodily fluids has become grosser and more prevalent to the point of disgust. While I have liked most of the books in the series, this one was over the top and I have not been able to finish it and dont know if I will. I have just found I no longer care about the characters or their over the top relationships. I hope that if Ms. Hamilton continues the series, she will revert back to the things that made the books special; the different monsters and the mystery of finding and destroying them. Enough already with the sex and messier aspects of the stories."
1,",,,deleted my original review","A disappointing mess of an entry in a series that absorbed and amazed me for many books.I'll leave it at that, since so many one star reviews of this book are vanishing."
