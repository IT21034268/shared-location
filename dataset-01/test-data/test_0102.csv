2,Will this never end,"Having stuck it out through all 11 books and the sequel, I am astounded that such a brilliant plot line could be turned into such a boring set of books. You have to conscientiously make the effort to drag on a story as slowly as this one has gone. On the rare occasions that the author gets around to advancing the plot, the books are interesting but unfortunately this doesn't occur very often. These 11 books could have been condensed into 2 or 3 fast paced, attention getter novels. I only actually read one of these books, the rest were listened to on audio during gym workouts and long drives. I learned they are a great sleeping pill substitute. If a 12th book is indeed printed, I will read it but I will have no thoughts of being saddened that the story is over."
2,Why 4 or 5 stars?,"People say stuff finally happens and gives it 4 or 5 stars on that basis, why? Ok, a few things happen but they are completely out of proportion to the time spent building them up and the resolutions are something I would expect a 10 year old to come up with. No offense to all the 10 year olds who think Jordans writing is juvenile.This book gets two stars for finally resolving stuff, even though it is done in a unbelievable and unintelligent manner. I am starting to believe that someone else wrote books 1-4 for Jordan, because no one could go from writing well-written(but highly derivative) books, to the dreck in the past few installments. Either that or Jordan has suffered from brain damage."
1,I hate Robert Jordan's books!,"Robert Jordan owes every person who has ever read a page of his books a personal apology. I have yet to receive mine.This book is only fit for wiping one's posterior (though I would personally recommend Charmin - it's more interesting to read).As you know George R.R. Martin's Feast of Crows comes out in November. Run, don't walk, to buy it.Also:""As our history doth not, like a newspaper, give great characters to people who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again, the reader may hence conclude that this excellent woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history.""TOM JONES, Henry Fielding. Take a lesson Mr. Jordan."
1,Good Lord what's with all the spanking???,"OK, like many others here, I'm disappointed (but he got my $20 anyway...). Simply stating that its not as bad as the last book isn't praise. I think this series actually died a few books past, but for some reason I had to continue to read. This one was the nail in the coffin though. Too many minor characters taking the main stage, too many plotlines that I really dont care about.And what's up with all the spankings!? I mean honestly, enough already.Jordan said in an interview there will be one more book in this series and then its done. I've decided after this many books NOT to buy that one because I really didnt enjoy this one, and I really cant see how he's going to neatly tie everything up in one novel (unless its about 5000 pages long).I still think Jordan is a great writer, I just think he let himself go with this series and wrote himself into too many corners to get out of successfully."
3,"Good read, serires back on track with this book","While Knife of Dreams was not the best book of the series, it certainly took a step in the right direction and was MUCH better than the previous installment, Crossroads of Twilight. I felt like the pace was much faster, the story had the benefit of better editing, and a few of the smaller story lines where brought to conclusion. The main stories moved along, and the characters are one step closer to the final battle.As with the last few books, there are a couple of stories that tend to get too much attention and over the top with details."
4,Moves the story on well.,"Robert Jordan's latest work was a satisfying read. Towards the end of the book I kept hoping that suddenly another chapter would materialize to allow the saga to continue. Alas, we will all have to wait until the next book of adventure arrives.No spoilers: The book ties up a number of issues from preceding novels and interjects some interesting twists that leave the reader wanting more. I'm not jaded from this series. It is a pleasure to read about a world being fleshed out carefully with each new chapter rather than simply having a hurried ending trying to messily tie up all the details.Bravo!"
4,"Finally, improvement.","I have been reading this series from when the first book came out. I even went back and bought the first book in hard-back (very hard to find at the time). The last few books have been a chore to read, although I felt that the last book (Crossroads of Twilight) wasn't that bad, probably a 3 star. The writing and storyline of Knife of Dreams recall the first 5 or so books of the series. Not as good, but close. I am just hoping that book 12 (the last?) won't be 2 years in the making. I just realized that this series has stretched over 15 years, with The Eye of the World published in November of 1990. 15 years!"
1,Class Action Lawsuit,"A book series is a contract between the Author, the Publisher, and the reader. The Wheel of Time violated every contractual obligation implied by continually attempting to have us readers buy books without end. This series should be completed, and the final book should be offered FREE of CHARGE to all owners of the first 4 books.If this does not happen, I propose a Class Action Lawsuit against the Publisher and Robert Jordan's estate.May Robert Jordan rest in peace.P.S. I wish I could rate this series a 0, for all of the disappointment it has caused to most of its readers!"
3,Disapointing,"I was very excited when I was finally able to buy this book; I have been looking forward to it ever since I found out the date it was going to be released. However, after reading Knife of Dreams I was very disapointed in the book. I don't feel like it was as good as many of Robert Jordan's books. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it, but it seemed like not much happened. There were a few key events, and a few of my suspicians were confirmed. But everything that happened seemed like it was rushed through, I think half the information that was revealed could have easily been added to the next book rather than have a 760 pg. book of pretty much just fluff. This book is vital to the series...but if you have to don't buy it borrow the book. Overall well-written, but it seemed like a waste of my time. Very disapointing!"
3,Knife of Dreams(or how do we pronounce their names),"The book started off fairly good and then it swap back and forth between charactors who I could not remember from the previous book, much less pronounce their names,and also I get tired of who has what on, lets get back to the to the story line and plot, move faster on the action, and for pete sake, have them quit keeping secrets and open up with a little trust in the charactors."
2,There may be hope yet,There may be hope yet. I have been frustrated at these last couple books. They are full of things that I do not care about. Characters descriptions of things that do not matter. The only reason I will read this last book is because it is being written by Brandon Sanderson. He is one of the best authors I have ever read. If anyone can bring life back into this series it would be him.
1,Where did I see that before?,"There is so little originality in RJ's books. Now that Martin's Jaime has lost a hand and become an interesting character, Jordan does the same to a lifeless character here. Except that there will be no point to X losing their hand in RJ's world, and he can't hope to touch Martin's characterization, despite this desperate attempt. This Wheel is Dead. Don't bother to read this junk."
1,Getting Ridiculous,"I've read the other comments posted on this book. Congratulations to all of you. You actually made it past the 1st chapter. I myself began to read this and quickly got lost in all the excruciating detail that Robert Jordan has come to be famous for. He could have finished the series a long time ago if he would have chose to not go into so much detail, and actually leave something to the readers imagination.As this book stands, he leaves once again very very little to the reader's imagination, forcing the reader to try and keep up with exactly how Robert Jordan wants his world imagined.I myself have given up on the series. For those of you who have just read Eye of the World for the first time, I recommend abandoning the series before you waste your time."
1,Yet Another Failure,"IT is clear that RJ has hired someone to write positive reviews for this book. Many were posted here before the book went on sale, which shows that TOR and AMAZON know that they'll never sell this junk without cheating. I've read this book. It stinks. Here's why:Once AGAIN RJ delivers junk. Rand is AGAIN MIA for most of this book. When he appears, it's only to be whiny and annoying for a short time. There's more on Mat here--which is NOT a good thing. Once AGAIN the Aes Sedai are skirt-smoothing, icy-staring, sniffing, scowling, tea-drinking bosomy witches. Once AGAIN RJ's chapters meander into the realm of FILLER and once AGAIN the ending is a quick burst of unbelievable garbage that makes little to no sense."
1,There seem to be 350 unneeded pages (again),"Look, RJ must have been spending time reading Harry Potter, and at the same time trying to write the end to these useless WoT books. I can picture him reading Potter, and falling asleep with a WoT blank page in front of him; and picture him waking up the next day with 50 or so useless pages that were mysteriously written while he was asleep the night before. Dont waste your time. Semirhage kills people, Rand loses a hand (and isnt mentioned til like page 353 or something), Perrin ""rescues"" Faile, Mat and Tuon sort of get married, Elayne gets her required backers (and becomes Queen), Egwene gets spanked (unfortunately RJ didnt add pictures of this - that would have bumped my star rating up at least 2 stars), and Oh yeah - Moraine is still alive - Mat is supposed to ""rescue"" her. Dont bother, this is the worst WoT book yet. The next one could never be this bad, so we at least have something to look forward to."
1,Meth is GOOD!,"Hey all of you gloomy RJ fans, if you liked this series, I have an idea about something else you might like. That's right...METH! You get hooked on it and are always looking for the next high never quite being able to attain that first euphoric experience so you keep coming back for more while the product delivers less. It will waste your time and take you nowhere and in the end someone is likely to die! Sound familiar? Yippee! Meth!I'm sure glad he took the time to write that prequel."
3,Better than the last book... but still some slow bits!,"I am still reading this book (aprox half way though), and agree with a lot of the other reviews I have read.It is definitely better than the previous few books, but that isn't a huge achievement. Also, there is too much written about minor characters. Can't RJ just kill a few off to keep the book focused on the main ones???My main gripe is the speed of the book. The Perrin and Mat sections have been good thus far, but the prologue (85 pages!!!) is far too slow, and when it took Elayne some 30 pages just to walk from the outside of the castle to her room and get changed, it was too much!!! Supposedly this has had a full editorial review. Bah! Get new editors and speed this thing up a bit! Sheesh, we all know that WoT books can be good, have been good, and hopefully will be good again before the end.Still, I will finish the book, as it is mostly good, but mostly because I have been reading WoT for too long to stop now..."
1,Couldn't make it past the first sentence,"I picked this up at my local Wal-Mart, and read the first sentence, and nearly passed out from boredom. Really, first lines should be a hook, and this was not."
3,The worst fear of any WOT fan - Health Problems,"After reading and re-reading thousands of pages from the WOT series one of the largest fears in my life would be that Robert Jordan would die before the end of this series.I was on the TOR web site where Mr. Jordan has stated that he has come down with some disease. I cannot understate how much I wish him well, but PLEASE finish the series."
3,so far so good,"An easy read. Have read every book in the series thus far and this is among the best. One is caught up in anticipation that something's going to happen - right around the corner versus a few of the books, of late, in the series, that seemed only to be placeholders. I was reluctant to purchase this, at first, for fear it would be another one of them but it's not and I'm happy that I did."
4,"Still not like the first ones, but much better.","Although Knife of Dreams doesn't have the same break-neck pace as the first few books of this series, it definitely moves faster than the last few. I was very glad to see some of the plotlines that have been going on for the last three books come to an end. I also have to say that the stuff about the Aelfinn and Eelfinn intrigued me and seems like it's going to make the next book very interesting. I'm really looking forward to that next (and maybe final) one."
5,Good read,"The book was very informative though appeared padded by newspaper accounts of terrorist activities which made the book longer than it really needed to be. Excellent historical background which linked the past with the present, providing a how and why of our present circumstances."
3,Won't Work,"I'm returning this ladder, because my wall thickness at the window sill is slightly more than 13"" -- and the ladder support brackets are slightly too small to fit over the window ledge. The specs say 6""-13"", and I assumed it would work, since my wall thickness is around 12""; but there is one course of brick under each window that sticks out a little. So, be sure to measure your window sill before ordering.Looks like a well made ladder -- too bad the brackets won't stretch open a little further."
5,Great Product- Reusable,"This is a great product. It is built well and it necessary for any 2nd floor. I took it out of the box when it arrived, opened the ladder up, made sure it works, wrapped it back up and it fit back into the box easily. It is now under my bed. Definately recommend."
4,Fire escape ladders,"After seeing the movie ""Fireproof"" we decided it was time to protect our family. We searched for a good price and a company with a good reputation. The ladders came quickly and we checked them thoroughly. After a practice we have put them in place and are hoping to never have to use them!"
4,Very important to have!,An escape ladder is very important to have in rooms that are 2nd story or higher. This ladder is very affordable and sufficient to allow the access needed to escape through a window to avoid being burned or having to jump. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OAPT0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,2 story ladder will not work with wall thicker than 10 inches (at widest point),"The description on the Amazon website says it will fit walls 6 inches to 13 inches thick. This is not true for the 2-story ladder. The widest the ladder can open is 10 inches, as correctly reported in one of the prior reviews. The instructions included with the ladder also say the maximum thickness is 10 inches. If the wall is 10 inches thick, the ladder will likely not work, either, since it probably won't hang right. In order to hang as shown in the picture, the wall can only be 9 inches thick. Measure the thickest part of your wall including interior and exterior sills. If you have a brick house, the ladder likely will not work. My wall was 12 inches, and the ladder cannot reach around it. Otherwise, it looked well-made."
3,Excellent Product.,Excellent Product. Manufacturers should stay away from using nylon though as nylon melts if close to fire. I think anything for emergency use should not use nylon to hold the steps.
3,Cate Tiernan's final books,"As with Night Child, Cate Tiernan's final book was a flop. You can really get into this book about Clio and Thais finding out what they want to do with their life, but when it comes to the end.... I felt that Tiernan was just ready to wrap everything up yet leave questions in case she felt like writing a fifth book...which the fourth is suppose to be the final..."
4,Autopsy-- Old School Death,"i was informed to check out Autopsy from a few fellow Heavy Music enjoyers quite some time ago and i have to say, from a Death Metal perspective, its a classic.one thing that i enjoy about older DM is how slapstick comical (granted GORY slapstick) the song titles can be [i.e. Charred Remains, Disembowel, Embalmed, Ridden With Disease].musically, very simple, fast and heavy. twas cool reading the liner notes and seeing Steve DiGiorgio [Sadus, Testament] played the session bass. production, about as unpolished as one could expect hah. one of the telltale signs of being an Old School Death Metal album.its a fun listen to say the least. for the sake of history its worth picking up and seeing where the DM subgenre came from."
5,Star Ocean EX - Continent (Vol. 5),"This is the 5th disk of the 6 disk series of Star Ocean EX. This disk continues the storyline of Claude and Rena's search for the Sorcery Globe. They will encounter more people and challenges as they progress towards and finally meet their destination, the Continent of El. The 5th disk certainly lives up to the name of the series. After completing this disk, I eagerly waited to watch the final disk to see the conclusion."
5,Additional hidden feature in this model not available w/ digital versions,"This is a great, high quality micrometer. The recessed body lets the head get right against an edge to measure.Best part about this model, and why I prefer it over the digital micrometers, is that these tend to disappear far less often. Coworkers will look at it, scratch their heads, and put it down and go look for a digital micrometer to steal. That and no batteries to replace ever."
5,Perfect?,After using a brown and sharpe this one feels much better. It is very accurate. I am using it for my engine rebuild and I get repeat measurements to the .0001!
2,Combinatorial Optimization,"This is a book for mathematic nerds. There are no practical analytical problems in the book to make it useful for those of us involved in quick solutions to solve problems such as payoffs for investments beginning with forces of nature and then going through probability factors to get to real numbers of what can happen to various investment opportunities.I did recognize the value of the book for those who are on the front lines of determining how many and where ISPs might be on a route from Edmonton to Washington but one can use other methods of project controls. The math in this book was of no value --- even a wee bit.When I came across the TSP or Travelling Salesman Problem, it reminded me of how I used to name physics problems for students. But, I always thought the TSP was really the Farmer's Daughter problem. Apparently it ain't so.JR."
2,Could it get anymore DISCRIPTIVE?,"It was sickening, the amount of details used in this short book. I have three words that explain my opinion on all of that unnecessary junk... I DON'T CARE! I don't care how exactly their water looked or how exactly the pioneers stored their food. I just want to know about Willow and her quest to survive. That's why I bought the book for goodness sakes! Not to read a textbook on pioneer life! If the author is so obsessed with putting those details in, the least she could do is put them in in an interesting way. I know these books are supposed to take place in just one day, but one day just doens't work for the Oregon Trail. The only thing I liked was that Willow was a pretty good character in that she was terrified of the river for a reason and in her feelings about her stepfather. But, I mean, where was the stinking survival in the book? WHERE?"
4,Sulpur Soap with Lanolin,"It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I'm not pleased with the smell of sulphur, but that can not be helped. They did the best they could to disguise the smell. Overall, it is good and works appropriately. I gave it only 4 stars, due to the sulphur smell...which is not all that offensive."
5,Great book!,"This book is outstanding! Once again another great book needed for my U.S. Military History class. Even though it is a historical book, it is written more like an actual story. Gives a good depiction of a bushwhackers lifestyle."
3,Negative Book,"This book was very negative. I know people sometimes need that, but I was looking for reasons TO have children, not reasons why I shouldn't. I already know all the reasons why I shouldn't. In the book she states some people feel that children are a lot of responsibility without a lot of rewards. That's exactly how perceive it to be. I wanted help trying to see the REWARDS. This book did not show any of them. So, since this book was so one-sided, I am still looking for help to show me the rewards of children."
1,Don't Bother,"Sadly, the author of this book presents herself as an authority in the baby-decision making realm. And in some ways, she may be, having been a family therpist for over 35 years.However, this single woman tells us in the introduction that she made a decision *not* to have a baby after asking herself the questions she asks of the reader in her book. So she does not possess the authority and insight of one who's been not only through the decision-making process, but also ultimately baby-bearing process.What does comes across is her belief that almost no-one is capable of being a good parent, especially if one were to follow her guidelines. For example, in order to be a good parent, in this author's opinion, one must have enough money not just for clothing and food, but also for summer camp, vacations, dance lessons, and private school. This, in addition to being an unrealistic expectation, is simply classist and highly inappropriate.Don't waste your time trying to work with this book."
1,Pretty awful,"My brother bought this game a couple years ago. I think we played it once. Since then it's been on the shelf collecting dust. Even if you are a LOTR fan (even if you are a super LOTR fan) I would not recommend this game. The riddles are straight out of the book, so if you have read the hobbit or seen the movie, the riddles are a joke. The song part is really dumb too. You just repeat after another person after they read the song. I can't even remember the other parts of the game. Buy LOTR Risk, that's a really decent game."
5,Classic!,"This is the same version that my parents read to to me every Christmas Eve growing up, I love it. The artwork is awesome...and the story, of course, is classic. I was so happy to find this exact version to share with my own children. I'm sure we will be reading it for years to come!"
2,THIS MOVIE IS NOT LIKE THE REST.......,WOW what happened? this has to be the second worst hellraiser movie! it barely has anything to do with hellraiser....very disappointing.....hellraiser deader was the absolute worst!!!!hellraiser is my absolute favorite horror series and the last two do not stack up at all!!!
3,Hellworld,"Hellraiser Hellworld....The movie was ok. it wasn't terrible. it was ok. The reason for this is that I like the way each Hellraiser is different. Yes it is like a teen slasher movie and I like the way Hellraiser original, Hellbound, inferno, and Hellseeker keep to a similar Hellraiser form, but Hellworld was entertaining to me. I look at this way. This series has 7 sequels, it has stayed alive for this long, and at least we get to see some decent kills at the hands of Pinhead. I do hope that the next sequel will return to the original hellraiser formula. As For Hellworld it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. That's my review."
1,I Would Rather Go To Hell Than Watch This Again,"Hellraiser: Hellworld is definately the worst Hellraiser film to date. Hellraiser: Special Olympics would have been a better title. The plot is pathetic, the dialogue is awful at best, as is the acting. By the time a franchise gets to part 8, it's expected to be crappy but this film opens up it's own puzzle box of crappiness. I can't believe the money that is wasted producing horrible movies these days. Hellraiser 8 only solidifies my opinion that the entertainment industry has gone to Hell. Freddy Vs. Jason, Alien Vs. Predator, Hellraiser 8, what are they thinking? Are there any artists left in Hollywood?"
3,HOWS THAT FOR A WAKE UP CALL?,"The movie had a really good plot, and wasnt really like the Halloween movie at all. It seemed to mesh two different stories into one film and it balanced well for the most part. The final scene with Pinhead is always the best, even if the movie isnt great. Just remember the title of the review after seeing it."
2,not like Hellraiser 1 and 2,"I have been waiting for a film like Hellraiser 1 and 2 . But the good old times are over. This movie is like many movies part 1 is very good part 2 is also very good but then the quality is going down. I have now all parts from 1 to 8 ; but after part 4 the quality has changed.Better buy Part 1 and 2 ! Okay for collecting you must have all, but do not hope you get the HELL like before."
3,"Oh come on, its not THAT bad...","You really can't blame Rick Bota for his last 3 Hellraiser installments. After all, he manages to add a true air of creepy grittiness and nice visuals despite miniscule budgets and overall lame scripts.That being said, the screenplay to the 8th Hellraiser installment is far from a continuation of the original Clive Barker concept from the first 2 (or 4, if you're generous) movies. In order to halfway enjoy this movie you have to go into it expecting a typical slasher horror flick. Once you accept that, the movie is decent considering its budget.One reviewer said that there was nothing redeemable about this movie - I disagree. 3 stars for the smoking hot chick that leads one of the dudes to his doom. ;)"
1,s*&t world more like it,"This movie makes even Halloween: Resurrection look like a horror classic. By far the worse Hellraiser movie ever. It does not even deserve to be called Hellraiser cause it has nothing to do with the movies. Deader was crap but this is below that by some margin. After watching the first 4 parts of the franchise again,i only felt anger over this one. Either bring back Hellraiser as we knew it in the 80's or kill it off"
1,What The Hell?,"This movie is an utted disgrace to all horror movies and especially Hellraiser, the plot sucked, the actors and the acting sucked and worst of all Pinhead was only in the movie for a whole 5 minutes. They should this crappy movie in the garbage, get rid of all the a**holes who were in this movie and start over with Clive Barker making the movies. As soon as Clive left the movies really started to suck. Please next Hellraiser movie make sure Clive Barker is directing it and Peter atkins is writing the script cuz these people just plain out suck!"
5,Great book!,"This was one of the greatest books I have ever read. I enjoyed it far more than I expected, it sucks you in and won't let you go until you are finished with the book."
3,Over rated novel of Jews in Amsterdam of 1659,"The author does a wonderful job evoking the setting of Amsterdam in 1659. Miguel Lienzo, a Portugese Jew and trader on the commodities exchange, has entered into a partnership with Gertuid, a widowed Dutchwoman. They are set to corner the market on coffee, which is just becoming known as a drink to evoke the mind, rather than dull it the way alcholic beverages do.It is a novel of repressed longing, misdeeds and the Jewish community of Amsterdam. The protagonist is haunted by his past and is harassed by the ""parnass"" of his synagogue. Amazingly little to do with coffee, and mostly to do with Jewish persecution within it's own community. Not as good as the author's first novel, and much over rated."
4,I love coffee!,"Having recently visited the coffee-growing region of Chiapas, Mexico, we were interested in the further history of this wonderful beverage."
2,A Tantalizing Disappointment,"Reading this historical novel is like going to the bakery, picking out a mouthwatering pastry, and finding it tastes like cardboard. The historical background seems well researched, the characters initially seem to be interesting, the plot promising. But read on, and you will only be disappointed by the shallow portrayal of the life at that time, the undeveloped characterizations, and the excessively twisted and, ultimately baffling, plot. Why did Liss bother? In this material, there is a very good novel. The Coffee Trader is not it. Maybe someone else should give it a try."
3,A painful read,"Like many here I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the machinations of the varied characters. As much as I enjoyed the characters, however, I was left feeling the more interesting ones were pushed into secondary roles: Geertruid Damhui or Alferonda, for instance. The book should have been about them. Joseph Conrad or Cormac McCarthy may have found the jewels of insight that were lacking here.I found the book painful to read. Just when I thought nothing worse could happen, it would...with cups of salt rubbed in. Humanity has no redemption (except maybe some of the errant women). Perhaps that is true, but it doesn't make an enjoyable read."
3,Hmmmm...It's something you have to be in the mood for,"I am a huge fan of Emperor and Mayhem. Before I purchased this album, I knew very little about Darkthrone except that they played all-out no frills black metal. I was excpecting a raw, brutal CD when I popped this one in. There's very little to say about this release. Darkthrone, Marduk, and Burzum to a lesser extent have done this raw, brutal thing to death. This is a CD that anyone who has a craving for primitive, hyperspeed black metal needs for their corpsepainted little selves. For people new to the genre, I reccomend something else. Darkthrone fans will love this, but I'll save Soulside Journey for one of those days where I crave mindless speed and brutality."
4,An entertaining swashbuckler,"Although a little thin in the mystery department, A Famine of Horses presents us with an interesting, entertaining character, authentic-seeming details of Elizabethan life, and lots of action. Sir Robert Carey arrives in the borderlands of England/Scotland to take on the job of Assistant Warden and has to cope with a jealous rival, a funeral procession lacking horses, a dead body with dangerous, revengeful relatives, and the arrival of his lady love--married, of course. How Sir Robert solves both mysteries, of the disappearing horses and the body, makes a fun read that you want to gallop through to the end! I have never read any of this series before and am looking forward to more."
1,No NO NOOOOO,"nothing here but photo montages to songs, and not even crisp photos, they've been altered and are black and white. old footage of 'round and round' in 1984 on an LA station, but altered to look bootleg. it goes on and on! even actual concert footage is not good, you'll be watching an Arcade concert and it skips out halfway through the song. btw, who shot the video for 'in like pink' c'mon SEP I could have done soooo much better for you!! just go to youtube and search for ratt, arcade, sep, etc"
2,Okay While it Lasts,"This is a handy product to have around, especially with the suction cup accessory to hold it upright in your sink. But the sponge is too flimsy to do much beyond glasses or very superficial mess, and the green scrubby portion of the head falls off within a few washes. Definitely not the best dish brush I've used."
4,Do the dishes!,"Nice. I use it everyday. It works on the dishes, glasses and for lite cleaning on the pots. A nice lttle gadget. Buy the replacement heads too.Durable it will last."
4,Great White : Live and Raw,"This was for sure raw.After recently seeing Great White in concert, i needed to have a live concert of them.Since this seemed to be one of the only ones around i bought it.Despite other reviews not happy with it i was expecting not a very good DVD.This was for sure as if someone in the show had their own camera and took a video.It does not meet todays technical dvd's,but this concert was from the 90's.Based on that it was a good concert with their hits songs. I was happy with the purchase"
5,will shop from here aging!,"Great shipping and service, product was as stated and in perfect condition when it arrived! 5 stars"
1,Strong soapy scent...not appealing,"Don't get me wrong...i LOVE JLO's perfumes but this one is a miss! It smells like a cheap hotel soap and is overpowering. If you are looking for a great scent try her ""Live"" perfume which smells amazing. I wear it daily and gets compliments all the time.Stay away from Glow...unless you were an exclamation fan back in the 80s."
3,Nice but not great,This perfume is nice but does not smell like my type of perfume...it is a clean smelling perfume but I perfer perfumes that smell more floral...if you like clean smelling perfumes that smell like soap this if for you!
2,"Like the show, but Limited Questions and Slow Loading","Let me say that I love trivia games, and I still love watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire on the tube. As for the playstation game though I have to say this. First of all the game has a very limmited variety of questions that start to repeat after only a few plays of the game making it bore to play after only a couple of days. Number two, this game could not load more slowly from question to question, its like sitting and waiting for your death. I can get a right answer and wait a full minute untill Regis is reading the next question, its just so slow you will want to scream. My advice, watch this one on the tube, leave the playstation game alone though. Try You Dont Know Jack on your computer or Playstation instead. Its a better triva game suited for at home play with pals."
2,Not the best of games....,"First of all, I don't know why this game has a 2 player option. Two people face off and only 1 person gets to play the game really. Some of the face off questions are so ridiculously hard that you will be guessing for a long time and the game will keep on telling you to try again and again before ending the game. It won't even give you the right answer at the end!! You should have the option to pass to a new question for the faceoff.In the game, now this is where the playstation is showing it's age. The loading speed is VERY ANNOYING. The questions are repetitive after awhile. The phone a friend dialogues are amazingly cool and funny. Regis adds a few wise cracks and you got a less than average game. Not worth buying but go for a rental."
3,surprisingly low quality of illustrations,"It would make a great companion volume to the previous Jim Moran' book if not the poor quality of illustrations, especially modern recreations. 'Modern' photographs are (at least most of them) small sized and not quite 'sharp', uniformed models and details of equipment blend into the background. There are no color illustrations at all. Quite disappointing..."
4,Sure to please!,"I picked this up new and have not watched it yet. It features performances from The Lefevre Quartet, The Chuckwagon Gang, Lulu Roman, The Rambos, The Nelons(featuring Kelly Nelon Thompson), The Downings, The Speers, The Hinsons, The Lewis Family, A tribute to the Cathedrals, and The Singing Americans (featuring Michael English). Sure to please anybody who loves Southern Gospel Music."
3,Low paper weight,"In a rush I bought these envelopes to use for photo greeting cards. The paper weight of these envelopes is low so you can see the enclosed photo and written message through the envelope. Not really top-notch, but serviceable. Now that I know how thin the paper is, I will not buy these again."
1,Amazon's questionable business practice,I would imagine it would be spectacular if Amazon would deliver what I paid for
5,Brooks writing is better than ever.,"I've been a fan of Terry Brook's Shannara books since they first came out in the late 70's. The most common criticism that Terry has stayed ""complacently"" in the old groove is perhaps true on one level, BUT what they don't always mention is that Terry's writing has moved forward in subtle ways with each new trilogy. His story telling is masterful and always enjoyable."
5,Adventurous Page Turner,"This book is a smooth read. The next generation along with some of the previous generation make great traveling companions. Lots of action as well as magical beings. This book is a spectacular start for the new series. It's a more colorful story and even better written than the previous series. After just coming from reading Terry Goodkind's new story (Naked Empire), what a breath of fresh air. It's a fantastic feeling when you can look forward to the next book in a great series!"
2,Jarka who?,"As an avid fan of Terry Brooks from the beginning,I find it hard to believe he authored this book. The plot is predictable, dialogue on the sixth grade level, and the vivid descriptive writing of his previous books is missing. I know this is Book 1 of a series, but I expected so much more than what I got.Get it from the library- I did. Not worth rereading."
5,Awsome movie,"Scarry movie made the old fashioned way.No sex, no gore. Just plain scarry. Well done. Hope to see more like it."
1,couldn't make it through,"This movie was incredibly irritating. I understand that the lines were not scripted and that it was based on improvisation, but all the actors speaking over each other nonstop made this unwatchable for me."
3,Good till about the last 10 pages,"I had heard good things about this book so I was anxious to read it. I really wouldn't consider it a mystery, more of a fiction type of book. It started out really well and about halfway into it, I thought I had figured out what happened. But towards the end, it all fell apart. The ending felt rushed compared to the rest of the book and the way it ended kind of left you hanging. What I thought happened did not, but I almost wish I was right compared to what really occurred. There is a very disturbing plot twist right at the end that caught me by surprise. I was disappointed in the ending and I'm not really sure if I would read the next one in the series."
1,The Cities - enough already,"I am way behind all of the other reviews, and I read this book roughly 6 years after everyone else, and thank heavens I did NOT buy it but borrowed it, I have read all of the bad reviews and they are right on, I would like to add just one more little tidbit in to the horrible writing style, did any one count the number of times she threw ""the cities"" into a sentence? Have I missed something in life here about ""the cities"" I mean really if she used the term once she used it 30 times at least, please tell me there was a point to this.... I gave it one star simply because it wouldn't allow me to leave it without..."
4,Courage in Africa,"If the only thing you ever knew about Stanley and Livingstone was the famous phrase ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume"", but would really like to know the underlying story and enjoy a truly remarkable adventure, this is a great book to read. Livingstone had spend his career in Africa and was probably one of the most famous white explorers of his time, having walked across Africa in the first half of the 19th century. He returned when he was older to find the source of the Nile. He became ill and lost, and many presumed he was dead. The most amazing, exciting and improbable part of the story is Stanley, a complete unknown, who showed resourcefulness and courage as a correspondent on assignnment by the New York Herald. He was sent to find Livingstone and ""scoop the story."" You will be amazed and on the edge of your couch when you learn how he did it by overcoming disease, insects, tribal warfare, and impassable jungle."
1,Incredibly slow-paced,"This 3rd book from the Bren Cameron series is actually worse than the first two from the series. The diplomatic minutia reaches stifling heights, making the book virtually unreadable... I ended up having to skim the last third of this book - and I NEVER do that (I read about 4 books a month).Working my way through this book reminds me of when I was a kid, and was made to force down food I didn't care for... sure it was edible, but it wasn't enjoyable.There are just too many good science fiction books out there to deal with the sluggish pace found here... and I've still got three more books from this series to go!"
3,Outdated,"Overall, this is a useful chart for teaching children about the digestive system. However, the food pyramid is outdated. Time for an update of this product."
4,Standard stuff from this band is another's masterpiece,"First of all I guess this band had to change thier name to Banished (?) after this came out, but that's just here so you can hear more from these dudes. Why? Because you will want to after you listen to this slab of meat. Some of the best, no-frills guitar distortion that NEVER varies in the world of '90's death metal, this band wins the gold medal. NOT ONE guitar solo, but you won't miss 'em, becuse Inherit the Dead is a riff vault, catchy as hell, and the vocals are so low (without sounding gurgly) that you'll swear he's belching. Streaks of Blood was my all-time faviorite song on this release, and I hope you can find a copy with the lyrics because they are sick. For fans of early Deicide, Grave, Entombed, Necrophobic, Immolation, Deceased, Morgoth. Not exactly a technical knock-out, but so riff filled, and almost EVERY RIFF is bad ass and crusty. I loved it when it came out and I still love it now!"
5,Kudos for Kuo,Kuo's tale draws you into the world of Internet mystique and ten figure dreams no matter what your background is. All the stuff you wanted to know about the .com revolution drawing on everything you already did. A fantastic read-
5,Bosch Does it Again,"The Bosch CS20 is the best circular saw I've ever used. It has power to cut through the toughest jobs. The direct connect cord is best explained by - ""why didn't someone think of this before?"" The hook hangs the saw perfectly on rafters, joists, and saw horses. This saw is light and tough. This saw is sturdy and extemely well made. The final selling point is that it bevels to 56 degrees. This saw is the whole package."
5,The New Testament: An American Translation,This is a very good translation of the New Testament. It is an easier read than the King James version. And the translation of words are very accurate.
1,BEARING SECRETS---I GUESS I MISSED IT!!!!!!,"Based on the other review I guess I missed it on this one. I really liked The Innocents so I bought the rest of the Wil Hardesty series. Boy, do I wish I had not. If you do decide to read Bearing Secrets be sure to have a pen and paper in hand and write down each character and how they relate to the book. You will need this as it is very confusing. I don't think I have ever read a book that I stayed so lost with the people in it. It goes back seventeen years and brings you up to date. There are just so MANY PEOPLE and groups involved. I ended up reading several pages twice to try to connect who was who. I guess I will read the next one as I already have it and hope it is like the first one and not the second."
4,Still a good series,"We do not have Tivo or DVR...so for us this was still a good buy. My Son loves LE and we have their other 2 DVDs also. Until I get DVR, this is still a good product if your children enjoy LE (even though Disney is a rip-off)."
4,Margaret Cho is a Genius,She is like a ray of hope in the dark discriminative world. When I watch Margaret Cho I get the courage to be what i want to be.I love you Margaret and I hope you keep bringing the light into our lives.
5,"classic and pure ""Pooh"" perfection","i love this cd! it is my favorite pooh cd. i would recommend this cd to anyone. it has a beautiful, classic-ly pooh sound. each song is played and sung to perfection. you'll find it to be a very irresistable, energetic and passionate performance caught on an album for all posterity to enjoy. if you want to rock on with pooh, then i urge you to buy this cd! don't wait, do it now."
1,Not a good instruction dvd,"This is not a good instruction dvd for spinning in my opinion and experience. First off, the instructor should be on a bike, not appearing during the workout in sunglasses and yell at the participants. You can't hear the music at all and all the instructor's instruction was not comprehensible for even a trained person in exercise physiology let alone a beginner exerciser. I would not recommend this dvd."
4,A solid game.,"NCAA Gamebreaker 2001 is a solid game, and it is much improved over last year's title. I found this to be more fun than EA's rehash, and I really like playing it. Casual fans will probably enjoy NFL GAMEDAY 2001 more, but being a college football fan, I really enjoyed what is here."
4,The thinking of the master,"I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in politics, arts and philosophy"
1,exploring psychology,"never received the book, and when i contacted the seller he didnt respond back. He ripped me off end of story."
2,too hard,"Our cat sleeps in the basement and the nights had gotten pretty cold, so I ordered this item, not realizing itwas made of hard plastic. Somehow I had envisioned something more along the lines of a hot-water bottle.It stays warm alright, but I'm going to switch to an electric heating pad for my aging cat's comfort."
2,Didn't last 24 hours,"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets, and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer, and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover, paw print cover, and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was, so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on, but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."
5,snuggle safe,"This item worked very well when trying to keep animals warm,without having to plug it in, it's safer then a heating pad."
3,I wish I had researched this better...,"I was not aware this item was hard disk based on the description, and remained hard after heating. I'm sure it would work well for others, but my cat was suspicious of his bed anytime I had it under his cushion. Unfortunately, it added too much bulk, like a mound due to the small size. I never used the cover it came with because my pet doesn't like anything that doesn't have a familiar feel or scent to it. I must say the disk does heat up well, and not too hot to touch, which is good. I'm looking for a softer heating pad that plugs into an outlet, and covers a wider area that won't put my kitty on a hill when he sleeps. Not sure how much luck I'll have, but I'm trying."
4,IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS!,"I was hesitant. It does work. I had to figure out the wattage on my microwave first, as it warns you not to over heat it. Aside from it being hard as a rock, it does work - I heated at 10pm and it was still warm at 9 am. Not too warm - comfortable. I placed under a pillow that was not too thin or thick, so the heat could be felt. My dog slept comfortable. I also order a separate cover but it alreadly came with one. Does what it says just wish it was softer."
5,Great for keeping feral cats warm,"This is a wonderful product. I wish it was not so expensive, when you have a colony of feral cats more than one has to be purchased. But I am so thankful for this product. Thank you"
4,"Small and rigid, but it really works great","There is a stray that has taken residence in my backyard long before I moved in. I have other cats that would not take well to me taking her in, and quite frankly - I think she'd be miserable. However, I couldn't rest unless I knew she had a warm place to sleep on cold nights. The SnuggleSafe Heating Pad is BY FAR the BEST product I have come across to keep her toasty and safe. She has a little house outside and all I have to do is heat it in the microwave and put it under her blanket at night and she's happy and warm.Pros: No power outlet neededStays warm for hoursEasy to heat and placePeace of mind that she's warmCons: Hard as a rock (I put a fluffy/furry pet blanket over it to soften it up)You don't need to buy the extra cover that is advertised since it already comes with oneOnly good for small animalsI HIGHLY recommend this product,"
4,Kill Bob,"Stick with this 70s crime curio. The tense, violent second half will have you on the edge of your seat as you ponder -- ""Sydney Pollack directed this?"" Great performance by Takakura Ken."
5,"Fast delivery, awesome movie","Great movie, with a deep storyline but not too difficult to follow. If you are interested in organized crime movies mixed in with a little culture. If you are a gamer i suggest also lokking at the Playstation 2 games of Yakuza and Yakuza 2 as a compliment for the movie."
5,Great Series---read the others!,I have enjoyed this series and particularly like this one as it gives alot of details about Scotland...
5,Wonderful!,Another great Gabaldon! Lots of interesting insider info. So very much looking forward to the newest book in the Outlander series!
3,Companion,"THE OUTLANDISH COMPANION is a fan's handbook that is as engaging as the series it details. Diana Gabaldon's expert early computer skills, Google did not exist when she started writing the Outlander series. She was working with scientific data.The horoscopes were drawn by a fan and make fascinating reading, you wonder if Diana will use any of the information as character points. Tempe ting for a writer but shaky for a scientist.The dictionary (glossary) could be stronger, but I know the problems with that one. What is obvious and what is necessary are vital questions.Read the stories, then the companion and hope there will be a second companion when the series is complete.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Dissappointment in content,"I'm dissapointed in the new reference type book for several reasons: There are no explanations or sketches of the costumes of the period. What exactly are ""breeks"" anyway? Very few drawings of the geographical areas. The glossary is not alphabetical! How can one look up a word or phrase if you have to page through the whole glossary -- not very helpful while you are reading the books. I was hoping for help in understanding or relating to the times. I was not interested in a detailed horoscope of two fictional characters. I'd rather have had drawings of the characters and a lot more hard fact about the period.It is an interesting book. Just not quite what I expected."
3,"New York, I love you",I should have rented it first and then decide to buy later but I really did not care the story behind the title. Great condition and fast service. If you buy this rent it first.
1,Worst movie ever.,Oh....<snooze>....my......<snooze>......gawd......<snooze>. The most boring movie ever! I've officially wasted one hour and twenty six minutes of my life watching a series of short stories that don't tie together.
3,The capital of smooching,"A rather silly little film. It is in no way love for the city of New York which is hardly explored or presented, except as a hunting ground, but evanescent and transient love in New York. Nothing really regular, only accidental meeting and sexual exchanges that are more at the level of the word, not really courting but rather shocking in order to get the fastest and most comprehensive reaction that has to be sexual action. A couple of situations are funny, but never very kosher and that leads to a mutilated vision of New York with only Jews and Chinese. Rejection of the others and stigmatization of those shown. A film to avoid if possible or to see in order to learn the art of the caricature that means nothing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"
1,Mutilation of a Classic,"Just a response to another reviewer; yes, this is Clair's 1950 recut of the film. But the recut is ill-advised, and is generally considered by most historians as a prime example of someone far removed from the circumstances of the film's actual production butchering their own work.Is this the 1931 classic, intact, as Clair originally intended?No, it is a recut, which most critics feel strongly is a disgrace.Do NOT buy this DVD; get the uncut version on VHS while you still can. Once again, Criterion should have restored the original version, rather than presenting this cut version; anything less violates entirely the spirit of the original film."
3,Of historical interest,"Sound quality is pretty bad. The background music comes through fairly well but the dialogue varies from comprehensible to zilch. And, of course, it helps to understand French (I do). All that said, the photography is pretty good. The images of the company factory/society(?) as a prison are quite striking, albiet dated. Not for the weak of heart or casual viewer. It certainly captures a particular view of industrialization and dehumanization fairly common in Europe during the 1920's and 1930's. Important for serious students of cinema/history."
4,cute,These cards are cute but this collection isn't as nice as some of the others with images on both sides. Still a great buy.
1,"obviously not ""new""","Although the box was sealed in plastic, the cards inside were not new. A couple of the cards are smeared with something brownish, possibly soda (?). This is not acceptable, considering these should've been new cards."
2,"Way, way overpriced","The cards are large, sturdy, and well drawn. Each animal has its name on the back in a nice cursive font. But there are only SIX cards in the box!!! At $12.95 per set, I should at least get enough cards to fill the Wee Gallery mobile. I would prefer twice the number of cards at half the thickness, since I don't intend to let my daughter gnaw on them. Come on!"
4,"Beautiful, but wish they were laminated","I got these before my daughter was born and used them with her from the beginning. There is no doubt that the first few months they really captured her attention. And I think the designs are just beautiful. I do wish that I could have found a mobile hanger that would allow the cards to hang horizontally so that she could look up at them, instead I've only found ones that hang vertically, making it almost impossible for her to see the designs.Now that she is 6 months, all she wants to do is put things in her mouth and it would be nice if these were laminate so I could give them to her to play with. I've framed them and they look nice, and will take them out to see if she is interested in them when she is a little older."
5,Gameday Rocks Madden!,"Gameday is a the best football game on the market. Plain and simple. Its gameplay is killing maddens, flat out. Gameday specializes in head to head games making them amazingly fun and stragetic. Unlike boring madden where the game is based off of playing the computer, gameday excels in gameplay and head to head action!"
2,Get Madden,"Gameday is an ok arcade game, but Madden tears it to pieces. Gameday has no where near the graphics Madden has, and Madden offers a more realistic game playing. In gameday a tiny HB can drag a DE for 5 yards. It is very similar too last years model."
2,Not an Improvement,"This game is near identical to Gameday2000. Same music, same sound, same plays. The graphics managed to get worse, somehow. They tried to make size and speed more of a factor, but it didn't work well. Having current rosters is the only advantage.I have owned every Gameday title, and loved every one. They always seemed to bet better and better. This version was such a step backward that I had to laugh. It was like the developers forgot they were supposed to make it, and threw together this version in a few days.If you have Gameday2000, don't bother getting this."
2,very dissapionted,I had never bought a 989 football game before and i wish i hadnt bought this one. The graphics are horrible it looks like I'm playing on a super nintendo. If you're planning on buying this game I suggest you wait until you get a Playstation 2 because that's the only way the graphics will be better.
3,outdated information,"This guidebook ""walks"" a tourist through London. The walking tours are informative and a delight to read. I benefitted by using this guidebook on my May 2004 trip.However, the book lacked three essential components that would make it as my single source guidebook. There were 1) no color coded map of the tube, 2) no overlaying the underground station names with the walking maps and 3) the incorrect hours of operation at many of the main attractions."
5,My 1st opera!,"This is the first opera I have ever listened to in it's entirety. Have never been a fan. But I happened to get the Opus Arte sampler and heard the selection from the Queen of the Night and was so moved I bought the blu-ray version of the entire opera. I am not disappointed. I love all the singing, the set and staging. The sound quality, which got me here in the first place, is stunning. Bluray is the newest hi-res reference sound and will hopefully accomplish what SACD and DVD-Audio didn't; mass market education and demand for hi-res, video and audio. I am looking froward to sharing with my daughters, 8 & 12. We'll see. Kudos to all involved."
5,Mozart would be pleased,"This is simply an immensely enjoyable and timeless interpretation by Sir Colin and crew of one of the greatest operas ever created. What I love about this particular production, is not only the flawless performances, but the undeniable humor and playfulness of Mozart's deceptively simple but utterly powerful music and Schikaneder's ingenious libretto that often sends the audience into uproarious laughter. While the profound scenes and themes of Die Zauberflote are presented brilliantly and effectively (Dianna Damrau is truly incredible as the Queen of the Night), this cast doesn't take themselves too seriously. The caricature of Monostatos is hilarious! The sets and costumes are exquisite but not too much for your senses to appreciate. Any fan of Mozart or opera should buy this DVD as soon as possible and then get comfortable for a few hours pure musical and theatrical bliss!"
3,Yeah but what about all tailgators and bad drivers???,"This is all fine and good but what about the road racers, tailgaters and cellphoners?Isn't some of our Ire a reaction to stupdity???"
5,Excellent Book for any C# Developer,"If you've already written some code in C#, you have to buy this book. It is focused on coding, and its examples get right to the point by including only code on the topic at hand. Each item is clearly labeled in the table of contents and if you want to use it as a reference, it works for that, but it is easy to read from cover to cover, too. Don't make this your first C# book, but don't wait long after you write your first bit of C# code to make it yours.I am a critical reader of grammar and spelling, and (unlike a previous reviewer)I didn't find the grammar and spelling distracting."
3,A stylistic leap more than a forward motion,"Taking inspiration from the rock-n-roll of the 1950s put into a jaded postmodern retrospective in the style of the Misfits, yet in black metal, Darkthrone degrade social image into sadism and madness yet only succeed in aping the third Bathory album. Their next work rectifies this problem. While like anything from this era of the band this album is rendered by inspired genius, its organization and emotions do not come together to a lasting experience of listening."
3,An OK movie,"I had never heard of this movie until I ran across it on Amazon.com. I made the purchase because I like Gene Hackman in just about everything he does.This is a reasonably entertaining movie, but not great. Some of the more interesting things about it are seeing a young James Woods and seeing near nude shots of a young Melanie Griffith.I don't believe that I can honestly recommend that anyone purchase this movie because it is not one that would be watched many times. In fact, I believe I will donate this one to our local library. That way, this movie will be watched by folks that would not ordinarily purchase a copy."
2,y-a-w-n,"I watched this because I'm a Gene Hackman fan. Despite his (youthful) skill at developing a believable shamus, I couldn't get into the three intermixed, sluggish, low-action plots - Hackman's disinigrating marriage, the persuit of the missing girl, or the smuggling. If you've seen Gene in the French Connection, the Firm, or the Unforgiven, don't expect the same from this early work."
3,JUST OK,"Although much praised, I found this film to be just an average noir private eye film. The tape I had showed the photography to be lacking; some scenes were so dimly lit that you could barely discern the action. I believe Arthur Penn's direction is lacking too.It is a chance to see a young Melanie Griffith and James Woods though. Who would have thought at the time how well they would be paired up in the future in ""Another Day in Paradise."""
1,"Cheap, very uncomfortable",This is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept in - I woke up partway through the night and threw it across the room! The seams on the inside are NOT flat so they dig in and leave marks on you. The elastic around the bottom is both very thin and cheap and is unfaced on the inside so it is scratchy. The elastic around the shoulders is also not faced so it is scratchy. I think the only way this might be wearable at all is inside-out...as if it wasn't ugly enough to start with. Totally disappointed with this product!!
1,A waste of money,"Another reviewer stated that this bra might as well have been made of tissue paper and I completely concur. For anyone with a bust beyond A or B - and a band size outside of the typical 34-36 - this bra just doesn't provide any support or fit correctly. It rides up in the back and sags in front providing little to no support. Despite the improper fit, I did try to make it work, only to find that the elastic gave out after very few washings. Overall, a disappointment. Spend your money on another more ""constructed"" bra."
1,Are these sizes based on children!?,"This bra is absolutely not true to size. I ordered an XL and felt like I was trying to put on a training bra. Also, the quality is very poor."
1,Horrid Fit,"I read the reviews for this bra before purchasing it and didn't think I'd dislike it - I have a small frame, so I wasn't worried about the small fit that others have complained about.Not so.The real fit issue for me is that the straps don't adjust in length at all, making the bra too ""short"" for me - and my guess is that it would be too short for a lot of other women too.So although the band is comfortable, and I like the pull to the side aspect of this bra for nursing, the fact that it slowly rides up and eventually over my chest as I wear it means that it is unwearable."
1,doesn't wash well,"Unfortunately the quality of this product is poor -- the elastic edging started to unravel after the first wash! Also, the sizing runs small."
2,Comfortable before 1st wash,"This bra was very comfortable at first, but after the first wash, it shrunk horribly. I washed it on cold and did a gentle dry but it shrunk so much it's unwearable and I bought a size bigger"
2,Not a good fit for large-chested women.,"I suppose this would be sufficient coverage/holding power for small-chested women, but when I nurse I'm a 36DD+, and it was TERRIBLE. I returned it immediately as it did not cover or provide any sort of hold."
1,XL??,"I am a 40C so I purchased the extra large and it is way to small. I was falling out of it, it was extremely tight, and there was no way to adjust it."
2,needs thicker bust band,After washing the bra the band under the breast curls up. The bra also rides up in the back to compensate the weight in the front. It could be that I ordered the wrong size. I went by the recommendation. Target has a night one by Bravado (basics) that looks way more quality. When I get the extra cash I'll be getting this...
5,Great product at a great price,"I was a little worried after reading other reviews but this is a great bra. It never claimed to be a sports bra or push up bra and all I wanted was something to keep my chest up off my belly without tight elastic or wires. I'm still pregnant so I'm not sure how it will work when I'm engorged, but I can't see it suddenly becoming flimsy just because I gave birth. As for comments about the material, it's like an old cotton t-shirt or even just like a pair of old-fashioned white cotton panties. It is thin, and when you get cold it shows, but it's not marketed as an outside the house bra anyway. I wear this every day and sleep in it too. It's a great lounge bra."
5,My wife says it's great,I bought this bra for my wife who just gave birth to our son. She likes it very much and wants another one...so I'm buying a second one for her.
1,NO GOOD,"I BOUGHT THIS BRA SO THAT I CAN BREASTFEED A LITTLE EASIER @ NIGHT, IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. YOU CAN GO TO WALMART AND GET A BETTER BRA FOR A CHEAPER PRICE. IT IS NOT CONFRONTABLE, IT RUNS VERY SMALL."
3,OK,"Product was fine, didn't fit, returned it immediately; got credit but it tooklonger than I expected. Would use this seller again."
3,Not much support,"This bra is comfortable and fine for sleeping, but it has very little support. If you're getting it only to wear during sleep, it'll get the job done, it holds the breast pads against the breasts. But don't expect this bra to do anything for you while you're out of bed."
2,quality could be better,"Bra is pretty comfortable, but the quality is lacking. After first wash the hem started to unravel. Sizing seems to run a little small also - I am normally a 34 C. Went with the Large for nursing and seems like it is a little tight."
5,WIfe loved it,"My wife has worn several different bras but this by far was the most comfortable and she loved it. As mentioned before, they are slightly on the small side, but still very wearable - if you have larger bust then probably go for a size up.They are very thin and breathable, but that's why it's a sleep bra :)"
2,Terrible sleeping bra,I purchased 2 of these bras and I have to say that I do not like them one bit. The material is incredibly thin but the worst part is how high it rides up in my back. I am not big chested so it holds my girls in just fine but it drives me crazy how ridiculously high it goes on my back. I am forever tugging it down but it is as though the back is a size extra small and the front is a medium. I would NOT recommend this bra to others.
2,"Comfortable, but...","This bra is very comfortable and fits well, but I am disappointed that the printed label on the back has started sticking to my skin after only 4 months of wear."
3,Blah. Yet to find a nursing sleep bra I like...,"This bra is made of very thin cotton. I ordered the white one...I have an average frame, and while it fit well on my chest, the racer back kept riding up high so it was practically between my shoulders instead of centered on my back. While this bra is pretty comfortable, it's completely see-through and not absorbent at all. I, of course, wear nursing pads with it, but I also get pretty sweaty in my sleep with all these extra breastfeeding hormones, and I don't like waking up to damp boobs. I prefer the Lamaze bra, but that one isn't perfect either..."
3,Not the Best and Not the Worst Sleep Bra,"I agree with previous reviewers that this bra runs on the small side and that the fabric is thin. I also find that the elastic around the bottom is not the most comfortable. There are better sleep bras out there, including another made by Medela."
3,Maternity bra,"It got here within a decent amount if time. But after first wash, it began to fall apart. Not good."
2,already fallen apart,I was more than happy with the prompt delivery from the seller but the product itself I am not so impressed with. It has already started to fall apart on the bottom chest band elastic. It also was never as comfortable as my other sleep bra.
2,Not comfortable.,This bra is not comfortable to wear at night while nursing. There is no support and it moves a lot while you sleep. It is also not true to size and fits very tightly. Order a larger size then you normally wear if you order this bra.
4,Perfect for the granddaughter,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 1.5 year old granddaughter. Looks like it should be perfect for her. She loves stuffed animals. Our 3 year old grandson (her brother) will have fun with it as well, knocking the pins down."
4,Trick ball and cute soft pins,"I bought this toy for my son's first birthday. The toy is very soft and each pin makes a slightly different sound when knocked down. My only critique is that the ball does not go straight, but it is fun to see him play with it and it helps to teach him about different animals and hand coordination. Good purchase."
3,"It's OK, not my fave","I got this for my son's 1st birthday and he had absolutely no interest. As he got older, he wanted to play with the ball but never the ""pins"". Since he's turned two he is suddenly very interested in this toy. He knows the animal types and he likes to set the pins up and knock them down. When we play together I put them in a triangle and put a book on the floor a few feet away for him to stand or sit on as the ""do not pass"" line. When he plays by himself he just lines them up and throws the ball at them. He could do this for 30 minutes or more. The ball is a little wobbly, which makes hit hard to control, therefore difficult to hit the pins and, therefore, sometimes frustrating for kids (and parents!). Also, the bottoms of the pins can get bent easily and not stand up so well. I would probably not by this set again, primarily b/c of the ball, but like the concept of the game, the animal characters which can be educational, and the soft plush."
4,good but not great,"The ball and pins are soft and great for small kids to throw and ""body bowl"" with. My nephew has more fun with throwing the ball around the room and running into the pins and kicking/body bowling them down. The fact that it does not take batteries is a great plus."
2,The Kids Enjoyed it BUT...,"My children really enjoyed this toy but I really didn't think it was all that great. The only thing they enjoyed about it was the ball. They threw it around a lot.I couldn't get the animals to stand up right, EVER. It is not educational besides the pins are animals. Since the pins don't stand up though the kids don't really pay attention to them.I ended up giving this toy away to someone who had a baby. I thought maybe it would be better for a baby who is learning how to hold things since the game part just doesn't work."
1,Too many important bands excluded,"Well at least they put Kraftwerk and New Order on here, but besides them, they have forgotten many important electronic music pioneers such as: Devo, Gary Numan, Magazine, Pete Shelley, The Buggles, Ultravox, Visage, The Flying Lizards, and Soft Cell. A lot of these bands don't get enough credit for their innovation, so it really should be no surprise that Rough Trade would forget them as well. I just expected Rough Trade to be smarter than that since they were such a good record label back in the '70s and '80s, but I guess not."
3,Not bad and I did recognize a 'Parrothead' mate of mine but not up to: Margaritavision or Live by Bay,More of look at the backstage sideof Buffett show. Released beforeTales from Margaritavision. Mylate father would have liked tosee it.
2,Just OK,"I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same. 1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything. My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray.2. It is a cleaning nightmare. I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!Good points:-pop off tray-divider that keeps them from slipping out-cool colorsI tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less!"
4,"High quality, made in Italy","We've been feeding our baby in this since he was six months old, and while the tray is a little high, it was never a problem. It is very sturdy and should last through at least a few children.My only complaint is that we sometimes pull off the tray and put it on the floor with Cheerios, but the ""Peg Perego"" logo on the front of the tray rubs off very easily. It is almost like a lottery scratch ticket. Since baby lifts the tray when it's on the floor and puts his mouth on the tray, the logo ""ink"" could potentially be ingested. For this reason, I just rubbed off the logo.Otherwise, no complaints. Definitely not a travel highchair but with the addition of the Chicco Hippo, we have all of our bases covered."
2,Is it really worth the money???,"I don't think so. My son has been using this chair since he was 4 months old (he is 15 months old now) and I don't care for this chair too much. When I put the tray on I must shove the tray into the chair 2 or 3 more times to make it ""click"" into place. Otherwise one side of the tray is not properly locked in. (I must do this EVERY time; VERY annoying.) Also, the tan leather doesn't seem to be as ""pretty"" as when we first bought it; it looks kind'f grungy (sp.) now even though I clean it all the time.I do like the fact that the seat raises up and down and also reclines, but many of the cheaper highchairs do this as well.I will not be buying this chair for my 3 month old. Overall, for the money, I would not recommend this chair."
2,Poor mans Dead Poets Society,"When I saw the beginning of this film I thought for a second or two I had stumbled onto the best movie ever made,namely the majestic Dead Poets Society of which this is a very obvious & poor copy. The opening scene even goes on about the importance of honour in a 1950s prep school & some of the students/actors are dead(pun not intended!)ringers for the infinately better Dead Poets cast. With the exception of Matt Damon who is a fine actor. How do the people in hollywood get away with this?? Avoid this silly copy & buy Dead Poets Society & thank me later."
5,Murder on a train,"The third installment of the Phryne Fisher series 'Murder on the Ballarat Train' begins quite literally, with a bang, when Phryne decides to leave Melbourne with her trusty and reliable companion Dot, and travels by train leaving behind her beautiful, fast Hispano-Suiza. Some sinister plot is afoot and Phryne has to shoot out the window of a train compartment to save the passengers. Thus begins the highly amusing investigation into an old lady's murder and a child's background suffering from amnesia and now given into Phryne's care. As the previous books, the story is vastly entertaining and Phryne solves the cases with her usual flair and common sense. The cast of secondary characters is growing and they are immensely likable, as is the heroine. I would definitely recommend reading the series in their publishing order as each of the characters becomes more rounded and a full picture begins to build."
2,Murder on the Ballarat Train,"Dismally un-engrossing, with cardboard characters and an improbable plot. I was not drawn into this story and the characters did not seem real."
4,Enjoyable mysteries,The Phryne Fisher series is great fun and a good read. I enjoy the Australian setting and historical detail as well. Each one introduces different historical elements and while not great literature they are entertaining enough to keep me reading. A great series to read when traveling or just relaxing on vacation.
4,Female vocal jazz,"I am a huge fan of Diana Krall. When I heard Terrie, I got goosebumps! She has a very sultry, yet warm voice that melts me! I will be following her career and buying anything I can of hers! I also liked the simplistic array of instruments to keep the image tighter and more personal. Highly recommmended!"
1,A disappointing overview of what could be a cool subject.,"READ MY LIPS contains photos that are not much more exciting than your usual magazine fare, and a brief text which is surprising dry and even more surprisingly--dull. There is also some misinformation, regarding statistics, dates, and names. It would be nice to see a book on the subject that is more substansive and actually offers information we haven't heard before, written in a more exciting style. A disappointment."
1,Nothing for the serious minded fashion expert here.,"This is long love letter to lipstick, written with the aren't I cool? bravado of a magazine journalist. A tiresome read, with lots of giggly plays on words. For now, I'll stick to Allure, and In-Style."
5,The most believable Hamlet,"I teach Shakespeare classes to adults and have a personal collection of seven VHS and DVD versions of Hamlet. Campbell Scott is by far the most believable, and my students have chosen it as their favorite version. Claudius is pefect--a smiling smiling villain absolutely capable of secucing his sister-in-law and murdering his brother. The casting of Polonius, Ophelia and Laertes worked well. The second choice of my students is the Mel Gibson, which had been number one until they saw Campbell Scott. The scene in the room where they have stored away all reminders of the old king is brilliant. Great film."
1,very disappointing,"Ok, first off, what in the world is up with the bongos and other crappy background music? It just doesn't fit in with the Shakespearian play at all. I can understand perhaps using a little rock music if you want a bit of a modern twist, but the slow jazz music and cheap-sounding piano really downplay all the emotional scenes. The movie wasn't affecting at all. And some of the acting was really crappy. I couldn't feel any sparks between Hamlet and Ophelia and the last scene was so anti-climatic. The swordfight was made too light of a matter - it just seemed as though they were just practicing or entertaining the court. This was the first time I ever saw Hamlet acted out (I had to watch this for a class) and I really like the play, so I was highly disappointed. I swear, you could find more entertainment in just reading the orginal Shakepeare script than watching this."
4,Snap Crackle and Pop,"This is wonderfully fun pop album, a true gem. The songs are immediately infectious, as all good pop songs are. The edges are a little bit raw, which makes the album all the more charming. These guys and gals are having a good time with this one, and it shows.My only complaint is that the album loses a lot of momentum as it progresses. The first six tracks are sheer brilliance, but after that the more forgettable songs begin to kick in. The problem is as much with line-up as anything else. If the more boring songs weren't so clustered together they probably wouldn't seem as boring. As it is, I prefer to listen to the first six tracks, the real knock-outs, and then put something new in the stereo. Really, though, buy this just for the stellar first half. It's not like the bad songs are that bad, but they seem to pale in comparison.This music is loud, upbeat, rolicking; it makes you want to jump around. Especially perfect for sunny summer beach parties!"
5,Pop rock insanity,"Do the lyrics make sense? Maybe. Are they sung with the conviction that they make sense? Yes. Add to this, and more importantly, layers of pop-hook gorgeousness with organ, guitar, horns, everything, and both male and female lead vocals. This gives you a consistently great pop record (in the old school sense) that clearly displays influences without being derivative. A mix of Kinks, Cheap Trick, Beach Boys, maybe some Go-Gos, just a great, catchy record. Listen once and it is OK, listen twice and you have a problem taking it out of your CD player. A big, enjoyable problem. Absolute standout tracks are Mass Romantic, Letter from an Occupant, My Slow Descent into Alcoholism, and the Mary Martin Show."
4,a novel of conformity,"Sinclair Lewis is best known for his novel Main Street. But Babbitt is a fine novel. H.G. Wells said of it: ""I wish I could have written Babbitt."" It's a novel about George F. Babbitt and the city he lives in, Zenith. Some of the greatest lines in the book are descriptions of Zenith, not the least of which is the opening lines. Lewis creates in Babbitt the total conformist and we follow him through his conformity and into thinking on his own. Babbitt is simply a man who wants to be liked by everyone. Babbitt gives expression to the glibness and irresponsibility of the professional social climber. Lewis gives us one of our modern classics."
4,"Long, At Times Boring, But Somehow ""Interesting""","Basically I recommend this book which I ""read"" as a book on tape. The theme is ""a man's life""---and the ""emptiness of life""-------and the search for ""the meaning of life"". You may perceive certain aspects of YOUR life in the life story of Mr. Babbitt. Thus, you finish the book with the idea, ""Hey, this author understands me"".....""I'm not alone. ""Other people have intermittant feelings of ""meaningless of life"" and I'm not alone."" You probably will get ""bored"" with some long-winded passages but overall the book is worth reading. Don't expect any ""deep answers"" to the meaning of life. But, the book does have a ""satisfying"" ending. Email: boland7214@aol.co"
4,listento the rest of the reviews!!!,"i bought this because of the price! wow i cant be more satisfied! i would give it 5 stars but i had no use for the glue! if u buy this i suggest that u go to radioshack and get some fastener hook locks! there like velcro so you can put them up without damaging the wall! other than that, 10 stars!"
1,Do Not Buy At This Price,You can buy this toy from Toys R Us for 59.99. Save yourself some money and do not buy this toy for nearly 200.00.
5,TRACK LISTING:,"1. MUSICA ES - MUSICA E2. ASI SON LOS AMIGO - IN SEGNO D'AMICIZIA3. SOMOS DE HOY - UNO DI NOI4. COMPLETAMENTE ENAMORADOS - UN NUOVO AMORE5. POR TI ME CASARE - TI SPOSERO PERCHE6. Y ME REBELO - E MI RIBELLO7. NADA SIN TI - SOLO CON TE""MUSICA ES"" ES UNA COMPOSICION DE 11 MINUTOS QUE CONSTITUYE EL MOMENTO MAS REPRESENTATIVO DE LA CARRERA DE EROS RAMAZZOTTI EN LA ACTUALIDAD"
4,Italian rock,"Musica è is the original Italian album and the 1991 blockbuster that followed his albums Cuori Agitati, Nuovi Eroi and In Certi Momenti. It's a strong collection of ballads and rockers that sold millions and created a place for Eurorock, a genre that can best be defined by referring to the music of Bryan Adams, for example: big singalong ballads and some rockier numbers, always very melodic. Strongest track here is La Luce Buona Delle Stelle which translates as The Good Starlight."
3,Not as good as I had anticipated,"I did get some things out of the book, such as how he explains the ""social engine"" process as a way to turn a company into a ""customer-centric company"". But on the whole, I felt there was a lot of repetition, and a lot of other stuff just seemed like good old common sense to me...I was a little disappointed."
2,Far removed from their earlier excellent work,"Don't change the pattern if it is working or at least go far away from what made you great - vocals, inspired tunes and dance hall music"
3,Cute but nothing special,I think there are much better plush toys for the money. My daughter had no interest and its cute just nothing great.
5,Cuddly and cute,Very soft and cuddly...perfect for a little one. My granddaughter keeps putting the soft toy next to her face. This is a winner.
4,Kung Fu Hustle,Good picture but sound cantonese just stereo not dolby digital or dts. Overall its a good movie. Dolby Digital just in english translate and its sound funny.
1,Unhappy!,Unfortunatly when I ordered this movie I didn't realize it was in the umd for psp format. I have not been able to contact Amazon or the sendor to do an exchange or refund. It is a shame because it came very quickly. It was my error on the order but it would be nice to be able to resolve the problem. In the future I will be very careful ordering to make sure I get the correct format.
2,Big mistake,"Wacky, stupid and overall unnecessary special effects. Great movie for kids that are 10, 11. If you're gonna do a kung fu movie, why do you have to involve fantasy elements? Why do they insist on doing this? I just don't get it. I admit its a pretty entertaining flick, but is not that great. Sorry, but Jackie chan is still number one."
1,"Great movie, Terrible access","By far one of the greatest martial arts movies of all time, but having the only viewing option as ""streaming"" , rather than being able to download and watch without pixelation from streaming, has convinced me to NEVER buy a movie through amazon again."
2,The Fu That Failed,"Kung Fu Hustle is a really cheezy movie, with a bunch of badly acted stereotype characters. The Voiceover work is horrible, and only barely can be interpreted as being the same dialogue as the subtitles show (and probably even worse from the original chinese).Despite claims to the contrary, it is not 'Crouching Tiger meets Looney Tunes'. The plot is nowhere as complex as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, there are scenes that seem to have nothing to do with the plotline at all, and some of the characters (especially the gay characters) are so ridiculously inslulting as to annoy me to an extreme. The Kung Fu was also pretty bad, the over use of wire work for humor side downright boring, and the reasoning behind what was going on even more ridiculous.There's a point where funny becomes ludicrous and unacceptable... where I lose interest and can't regain it. This movie went there."
5,Japanesse Comedy at it's best,This movie is hilarious. i love japansse comedies and this one takes the cake. I Recommend it for everyone
5,Excellent fun!,"I've been to see this movie three times so far, and it gets funnier and more enjoyable with each viewing. I am overwhelmed by the superb action sequences, the comedic timing, and the serious, touching undertones, all of which integrate to produce a truly wonderful experience. I whole-heartedly recommend this movie!"
5,As much fun watching a movie that you can,"Kung Fu Hustle is one of those films you might easily pass up. But I rented it one day and was incredibly surprised. The story isn't the main point even though it is a good one. But the characters are the big kicker. All the fights are great to watch. Now trying to get the wife to watch it is a different story. But if she is cool or you just want great fun in a movie, I would even buy it without even seeing it first. Especially at the low cost."
3,Kung Fu Hustle,"This is a GREAT movie, however it is subtitled. There is no mention of subtitles on the rental site. There is an English language version. I assumed that was the one I was renting (shame on me). As I said, there is no mention of subtitles on the rental site (shame on Amazon). LET THE VIEWER BEWARE."
5,A Great Comedy!,Kung Fu Hustle is a great comedy! The movie has a great story and tons of laughs. I was laughing through out the whole movie non stop. It is a great movie for the whole family all though there is a lot of strong violence. That is all I have to say.
3,Not as much as I expected but I like it.,"The fit was true I ordered my size hoping it didn't run small. The length was shorter than expected. The robe in the picture I expected but after review I guess it doesnt say it is but, it doesn't say it is not included. For the price I expected it to include robe."
2,Paid too Much,I purchased this to replace a broken Pocket Handyman IV. I was disappointed in the metric to inch features of the new Construction Master Pro. I work with inch to millimeters conversion. The new calculator only has keys to go between inches and meters. The cost of the Construction Master Pro was too much for my use.
3,Good preformance but once again poor sound.,"I've been a fan of and going to Rush concerts since Hemispheres. Saw them 5 times on the S&A; tour alone. They are wonderful musicians and performers. The live concerts rock. And this DVD is a great show but....Why oh why can't musicians of this quality get their act together and produce / engineer a consistent quality sounding product. Rush just seems to have more audio engineering issues than they should, (either lame washed out and tinny with no low end or over amped and distorted to the max), and this DVD is no different. As others have mentioned it lacks low end. Big time. Geddy's bass seems to be almost non existent sometimes. Neil's low end toms and kick bass drums have no oomph or punch at all. R-30's sound quality is better than this....Rio worse.Too bad cause the show is great. Hopefully they do at least one more tour and live shot and produce it with a quality audio engineer."
3,More of the same,"I love Rush, but I'm a little bummed I bought this. I already have the Rush in Rio and R30 concerts dvds. They are a couple of my all time favorites. This just didn't add much to the mix. Don't get me wrong, if you don't have a Rush concert dvd, this is a great one to grab (although I still love the passion and performance and song list of Rush in Rio). Sound quality is terrific. I just expected something a little more special given the reviews on this site."
5,Great concert!,"Here is another great concert from, in my opinion, one of the most talented bands around. If you haven't seen them before, this is a great dvd. As good as it is though, I would say the R30 dvd is the one to get to get a feel for their whole catalog of music. I went to this tour and was a little let down by their playing too much off of the new album. (Which some bands are doing these days). But it's Rush, and I HAD to see them because they might not come around again...you never know!"
5,RUSH is THE best music group literally ever to exist!!,"You will love this Snakes and Arrows DVD for many reasons. As a drummer, one of the best things about it should be Neil Peart's Rotterdam Netherlands drum solo! When I saw Neil play his drum solo in Virginia in July of 2008, it was the best drum solo I've ever seen in my entire life! Well I guess maybe tied with Buddy Rich because I saw him once but that's jazz and he's Buddy Rich - long story. You know, Rush will not disappoint if you get this DVD - they never have. They are hard workers, humanitarians, seem like super nice musicians and in my opinion RUSH is the best rock music band in the universe, but I'm biased! I've been Neil's biggest fan since I was 10 years old! We love you very much Neil, Ged and Alex!"
5,Simply Amazing,"I typically shy away from aging musicians... as they usually disappoint in comparison to their heyday. After attending two ""Snakes and Arrows"" dates in Atlanta however, RUSH totally proved me wrong. This Blueray does nothing short of capturing RUSH at the top of their game. In fact, I challenge you to find any concert DVD (or Blueray) of any other act that beats this one in picture, sound, editing, and general camera work. If you haven't checked out the newest RUSH album, you may want to purchase that as well. Excellent peice of work!"
4,awesome!!!,"I loved the last book in the series! It was so great! I totally fell in love with the characters and i was really waiting for Anothony and Rae to hook up! I could't put the book down once i started reading it. The series also took place where i live, Atlanta, Ga! i often go to Little Five Points so that was a big bonus! I would sit in my room and read it till 3 o'clock in the morning telling myself just one more chapter but i couldnt stop! The only thing that bothered me was the series ended leaving me so puzzled! I keep wondering, did Mandy and Jessie hook up? When does Sam die? Did Anthony and Rae ever marry? Are the gaurds that saw Yana and Sam escape come after them again!? She needs to make another book for me to be fully satisfied! But other than the ending, i totally LOVED the book! Fingerprints is my new favorite book series!"
4,Vabagond Tales,Bought as a gift for my son who is enjoying it immensely. Although used it was in excellent condition and came within a few days.
4,I liked it...,"Really like the desk--good size to work with--the only negative is it chips easily--already has a small area where the paint chipped off the door. Overall, a good deal for the money"
3,its alright,"they came in two big boxes and they're really heavy. It took me about two hours to assemble it with my boyfriend, but it's really pretty so it's alright. However the thing is that when I assembled it the top part of the desk cracked and now there's a thin line on the desk, but I don't want my two hours of work go to waste and lazy to send it for a return so I'm just keeping this."
1,Really really bad film - don't even think about it,"Although the film was beyond brutal filled with mindless nothing, some of the acting was good and believable. Too bad they had the worst script in the world to work with. Nothing else to say, move on folks nothing to see here."
5,Our nephew love it,"We bought our nephew this bag for his birthday. His 17"" dell fits great in it. He even puts his school books in it sometimes."
4,Very interesting and filled with suspense,"Read the book, it was great, saw the movie and it was good, but nothing compared to the book.... In the book, Terrorists seize Air Force One with the president, the first lady, their thirteen-year-old daughter, and more than fifty staff members.The terrorists threaten to execute a hostage every thirty minutes if their demands are not met. Washington has a NO HOSTAGE policy and they refuse to give in to the terrorists demands. The suspense escalates from there... The president is left to protect his family with the help of some of his staff.This is great reading material. I read it while on a nine hour flight, so that made it more intense..."
5,One great book,I'm 11 years and this was one of the best books I read. I know this because when ever I had the time I was stuck in that book. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes suspense and a good book
4,a lesson about true friendship,one day a half mermaid girl finds a hidden cave filled with gold and strange symbols. this cave holds a sea monster called the kraken. the girl emily then looses her best friemd shoma. shona is a real mermaid who is fit for a friemd. but after emily drags shona into the cave shona seems to lay off emily. will emily be abke to renew her friendship and calm the kraken before shona forgets about her and the island allpoints islamd emily liveds on is crushed by the krakem? find out im this adventuew thriller!
2,Not all thats its cracked up to be...,"My son is 19 months old now. I really dislike this highchair. Our nanny, who cleans it, dislikes it even more.I HAD to have this chair..just like I HAD to have a 4 different kinds of strollers (Peg-Martinelli, Bugaboo, Mclaren and a Jogger), 50 baby blankets, a kelty, a bjorn, Mustella (only), ...I could go on...for days..My mom laughs that I slept in a drawer and she used regular soap on my bald head. She still laughs at my baby wipe warmer that almost caught on fire.Anyway, my words of wisdom of my 19 months of momdom, save your money for a nice dinner...get a $30 booster seat. When having company, booster fits nicely in the closet and cleans up in a second.Oh, and forget cleaning the straps...ick!"
2,Surfline video review,I would not recommend renting or buying this video as the first film on the Surfline is out of focus for some reason. At one point I had a DVD of this film and the focus was fine. There is no problem with the focus on the second segment of this video on the California Western Railroad.
3,"Great Item, but not the same as photo",I like this foot muff purely because of its functionallity. It keeps my little one nice and toasty when it's cold.What I don't like is that the footmuff pictured is not the one I received. The pictured footmuff is red with a pattern on the inside. The one I got was more of an orangy red color with just a beige inside with no pattern. My husband describes the footmuff as a lobster fisherman color.I love all Stokke products so the only reason this did not get 5 stars is because I got the wrong footmuff.
1,Piece of Garbage,"1st trip out, one wheel fell off after the other. Apparently, empty the cart is great, however when carrying groceries (i.e. a mile and a half away from home), the cotter pins fall out and the wheels come off.It would be one thing if this were a cheap model, but at $65, it's $65 more than it's worth.Stay away."
5,Scarling is the thing that is missing in your life,"Ever felt incomplete? Confused? Violated by trashy songs that don't exactly complete you? Want something to relate with, something that you know from the second you bought it that it was destined to be? Obviously this cd is the answer to your prayers. I bought every single one of their cds the second I heard the music from So Long Scarecrow. It's spreading like an OCD music disease, but at the same time is welcomed by our age.I'd recommend it more than any other cd I own. (and that's saying something).-Wes (Provo, Utah)"
5,"SO LONG, SCARECROW.","So Long, Scarecrow is a work of art. It's one of the best and most addiciting albums I've ever owned. With each listen the songs get better and better. Scarling. has taken huge steps forward since Sweet Heart Dealer and I believe they have really found their true and unique sound. So Long, Scarecrow is full of emotion, distorition, and beautiful vocals from the truly amazing Jessicka. This 13 song album has a bit of everything. I found the songs truly catchy, original, and full of depth nobody but Scarling. could pull off. I think this album not only shows how much Scarling. has grown but how amazing they're going to be in the future. I would recommend this album to anyone, this is a must have for any Scarling. or JOJ fans.What are you waiting for? GO BUY IT! :P"
3,eh - not the best,"It's not right to compare Jack Off Jill and Scarling, because the bands are basically polar opposites. My musical tastes lends itself more (much more) toward Jack Off Jill, and this CD is just lacking a little something. The songs seem to blend into each other and proves to be a little monotonous. I listened to the full CD about a dozen times before the songs started to become a little catchy, which isn't a good signal that I'm in love with it. I think their previous efforts (earlier Scarling Cd's) were much more compelling and diverse."
5,Fantastic,"I think this album was great, yes it was a huge step away from Jack Off Jill. Want to know why? Because it's Scarling, not Jack Off Jill. The bands only share a common thing which is Jessicka. People should not expect to different bands with different genres to sound alike. I personally adore Scarling, and can't wait for other albums they decide to throw at us. So long, scarecrow, touches on many subjects including narcissism and indulgence in everything. Even songs of changes. I think it should appeal to most people, and be enjoyed."
5,Women in Black,"With this book blurbed by Franzen and Foster Wallace you know sort of what you're in for: verbal brilliance, unusual settings, darker humor. Costello does not disappoint. His novel about Vi, a Secret Service agent assigned to an unnamed Vice President in the midst of a Presidential campaign, also tells of Vi's larger family, her collegues, their 'down time' lives, and a refracted view of America. While Costello seems to fit right into a certain subcategory of novelists (afore mentioned Franzen and Wallace--what category would that be labelled I wonder?) he isn't a clone. He has a more narrative driven, accessible novel here, one where you get to care about some of the characters; certainly he is very very talented with the language; quick wit."
3,Waiting for action.,"Beautifully written book that goes nowhere fast. If it hadn't been so seamlessly written, I'd never have wasted several hours of my life on it. He could have done better with a little effort, too bad."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book thinking I was going to get great inside dope on the secret service and a compelling plot. While Costello certainly includes some great nuggets here and there, overall he's more concerned about trivial, everyday occurances that don't advance the story. By the end of the book, I was left with a big ""is that it?"" feeling. Skip it or borrow it."
4,Recommended novel about the Secret Service,"Costello's survey of a Secret Service security detail guarding an unnamed Al Gore character in the 2000 NH primary has a long lead-up but provides engaging writing about characters as we learn about the people involved in the final scene. (One of the reviewers below writes that nothing happens -- I wonder if they finished the book.) I agree that the book isn't a conventional novel -- see it instead as an Event with the main protagonists drawn in illuminating detail. For example, the description of Tashmo is terrific -- his admiration for Reagan, his aspirations to look like a semi-Cowboy dude, his persistent womanizing, the whole routine about fixing his truck while he is up in NH guarding the VP. Very entertaining and readable.After reading ""The Big If"", I asked a friend who's brother was in te Secret Service whether the job was a tense one. He said that it wasn't - rather, it was boring with occasional flare-ups."
1,couldn't get past the first 30 or so pages,"I love well-written books and read hundreds each year, but this one left me cold. I put it back in the 'return-to-library' pile as soon as the protagonist tossed a live parakeet in it's cage out a car window. UGH. I do admit that up until then I was struggling anyway so it really did not take much to convince me to give up. I just didn't get anything amusing, inciteful or profound out of those initial, awkward pages."
4,The power of a lonesome voice.....,"That tatterd guitar and the years of heart-breaking living come to the surface on this album. You hear strains of ""Me & Paul"" on the title track and the the others bring you back to 'Blue Eyes' and 'Bloody Mary Morning'---the golden years! This is a great album."
5,Great Book for the money!,The book was in excellent condition. It arrived on time for a Christmas gift. The receiver was thrilled as it has historical pictures and a historical accounting of the incident.
5,Little Scarlet,This is one of my favorite authors. I really enjoyed reading this novel and can't wait until the next one comes out.Excellent book!
2,Not Sturdy,"We bought this case for an 80 GB Ipod Classic. It was a tight fit, but that was not a problem. The openings are in the right place, and we had no plans to take it out of the case often. However, the hinge is very weak. After being used only a few weeks, it started popping open at the slightest touch. It will not stay closed now. We decided to switch to a different case."
5,Great Product,"Bare Minerals makes great products that when used according to their instructions gives lasting performance. I'm sad they are discontinuing this color, it makes the perfect base eyeshadow."
3,fun,"love the color. can't use BE every day on my eyes or they swell up. I do love the color, though."
2,Bit choppy...not the usual Medwed read,"I've read Ms Medwed's other novels, however this one just didn't read as well (as the others). I honestly couldn't get past the first chapter. The writing seemed all over the place. Can't say I liked the main character either. I also couldn't get past the names of her kids....Timmy and Johnny. Ugh."
2,Needed more information,"The book was detailed on jobs, but could have used information on salaries. It was also very basic not too much detail involved in this one."
5,"Subtle pedal, nicely built, easy to operate","This little pedal is really nice if you are looking for a subtle way to help your sound. I play bass, and I use this pedal now all the time, although I may use it for select songs as I learn more about it. If you are looking for a radical makeover in your tone, this is not the pedal for you. If you are looking for the finishing touches to an already nice tone, this is worth looking at. The Amazon price is almost half what it costs on other sites, and if you have Amazon Prime, return shipping is free, so you have nothing to lose by trying it out!"
4,LIFE EXPERIENCES,"GREAT BOOK, I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE.ESPECIALLY FOR THE ONES THAT DO CIVAL WAR ENACTMENTS!"
3,Caribbean adventure,"In the mid-1980s, Janet travels to one of the islands in the Turks & Caicos group to do research on the island's history. She befriends Michelle, an unhappy married woman, and the two are more and more drawn to each other. When Janet stumbles on Michelle's brother's dead body, she finds herself drawn into a convoluted mystery of hidden agendas, political corruption, and blackmail. She continues her research and finds some rather intriguing information about one of the famous denizens (which reminded me of Patricia Powell's ""The Pagoda""). Like the other reviewers, I found the book fascinating, as well as sensual and compelling. The love affair doesn't end happily, rather hopeful."
2,A very poor serial,"First there is the problem of the VCI logo flashing every four minutes for twenty seconds. It is completely unacceptable to interfere with potential enjoyment of a product in that fashion.That said, it is hard to enjoy this serial. Virtually the entire serial is a repeat of a basic car chase and the use of some ridiculous gadget at headquarters to resolve the cliffhanger.Captain Video is frozen on a distant planet and headquarters just happens to locate him and send out a defroster beam. Pure cheese.This serial is for completist collectors only. Others should look elsewhere"
3,Stepfather Villain Part XII,"I feel sorry for stepparents. It seems that they are used way too often in films as the villains. This is another one of those.A 12-year-old boy's divorced mother (Teri Polo) remarries the owner of the town's brickworks (Vince Vaughn, once again playing the ""Psycho""). The town thinks he is the greatest (as we are told in far-from-subtle scenes, including one presentation of an award from the Chamber of Commerce), so when the boy sees him kill someone, no one believes him except his poor boatbuilder father (John Travolta, once again playing the noble character--we know this because his first scene involves his selling of a boat below cost, the filmmakers make sure to spell out everything for us). The main reason for his not being believed however is that he lies (which we are told in no uncertain terms at least twice.Despite this being not the most intelligent film, I was able to enjoy myself. It has tension in all the right places and good acting all around."
3,Less than mediocre story...,"Frank (John Travolta) is concerned about his son Danny who is often getting into trouble. It seems like it stems from his ex-wife remarrying with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). Frank's ex-wife also wants him to try to help Danny become more accepting of Rick. Frank finds it hard, but understands the dilemma and does what he thinks is best for Danny. Frank even attends his ex-wife's wedding in order to make Danny feel more comfortable with the situation. At the wedding, Frank meets Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi) whom shows up unexpectedly and it seems to make Rick feel surprised and uncomfortable. It seems like Rick has a dark past together with Ray and it is about to cross Danny's future. Domestic Disturbance is a thriller that has a terrific cast, but they do not save the less than mediocre story."
4,Enjoyable Thriller,"Definately an enjoyable, fast-paced thriller that would have been nothing if not for the performance involved. A second viewing helps, w/ a few throwaway hints (Steve Buscemi agressively calling Vince Vaughn ""Jack!"" and Vince Vaughn telling Teri Polo what stress might do to her) that tighten the plot. One thing, however: Why didn't the DVD include the alternate ending that ended up being re-shot? From what I understand there's about 20 minutes of different material that could have resulted in a very nice, ""Joy Ride""-type disc."
3,Worth Renting For A Couple Of Bucks,"This was a decent thriller with good-guy ""Frank Morrison"" (John Travolta) trying to save his former family from the dangerous new husband. That's not a new theme in Hollywood movies (the dangerous husband) but this is acted well and presented without heavy-handedness. They were smart to keep the story relatively-short, too, at 89 minutes. As a consequence, nothing dragged.To me, the film would have been more enjoyable had the 12-year-old boy been a nicer kid, but he's an annoying brat. The mother (Teri Polo) is not that endearing, either. Definitely a movie that will entertain but a one-look film and nothing more, especially with the ending being as predictable as it turned out."
2,A by the numbers thriller that's way to short,Domestic Disturbance is strictly a by the numbers thriller. Director Harold Becker who made the superior Sea Of Love seems to walk through this film. John Travolta does give a good performance though and Vince Vaughn does ok as the bad guy but I wish he would have been more meancing. After seeing Vaughn in comedy's of late he's pigeonholed in my mind as a comedic actor not a hard a$$.
3,Swing arm mirror,I'm satisfied with this mirror. We placed it on the wall beside the BR sink so my wife can use the magnifying side for make-up and she can take care of the back of her hair as well. The only weak point I've seen is the lack of locking washers on the sides of the mirror.
5,preposterous but great,"The publisher must not have advertised this book AT ALL -- I found it purely by accident -- but it is a wonderful first mystery in the ""screwball"" mode. In fact, I read a great many of these, and this is one of the best -- entertaining without being too strained. As other reviewers have noted, the plot involves writer Cece Caruso, writing a biography of Erle Stanley Gardner and suffering writer's block. Reading old correspondence leads her to a convicted murderer who asked for Gardner's help decades ago and who is still in jail. Cece decides to solve the crime.Following this plot obviously involves considerable suspension of disbelief, but the story moves along at a good clip with entertaining episodes and all the right ingredients -- an old mystery, a locked box, wacky best friend, and so forth. I highly recommend it."
1,Painful,"I got an Ipod for Xmas and wanted something to allow me to charge/play, in one unit. I saw this at a local store. The look and price were compelling. I got it home, set it up. There were a couple of negatives, right off the bat. First, like many others have mentioned, there was a constant light buzz or hiss sound. Some songs were better at hiding the sound, but some were painful. The other big issue I had with this was the button which allows you to change between the FM and ""Ipod"" mode. When I pressed the button to go into ""Ipod"" mode and played a track, initially only one of the speakers worked, then eventually, the other kicked in.I am realistic. I am not expecting a Bose sound out of this, but come on. Right out of the box and both speakers iratically work. Nice.I took it back. You get what you pay for."
1,looks great but sounds terribe,Same comment as other reviewers -- low grade hissing constantly. This is my second one and i'm taking it back.
5,Very Good Whistle,"I like this whistle's slim design. I wear it when shopping in rough areas. If I am apprehended, I intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant. This whistle is much louder than my voice, and carries well across other sounds."
1,Received wrong item,"Ordered this item, which is a clear folding stand, and got a small black stand instead: http://www.amazon.com/BCW-Pro-Mold-Sports-Stand-Display/dp/B000MWM05O/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_cWas a part of a Christmas present so I had to deal with it. I do not appreciate paying $4.28 for an item and getting an entirely different item worth under a dollar. I feel ripped off, be prepared to deal with a mix-up like this in case it happens again."
3,Surprise elephant review,"The product seemed small for its price. Our one year old grandson had played with the toy at a friend's house and enjoyed it. We ordered it for him because our daughter told us that he seemed to like playing with it at his friend's house. It was not packaged very well. It will be loved by our grandson, so that makes its a wothwhile purchase."
5,Great stuff!,"""Todo de mi"" is by far one of the best productions of the year. A very complete CD, with music wisely chosen and Janina's voice is better than ever. It has so much variety of music but always staying in her line and that's what makes this CD an unique product. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,p,"This drive worked beutifully in the first 6 months in on of our school research laboratories, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After they trusted it for work and research data backup, done just once every 2 weeks, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, they simply got nothing. Surperisingly, when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University, they discovered that many of us, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there before."
4,good book,"this is a wonderful book. it is just of photos though, so it will not teach you yoga. wonderful tool for any yoga teacher or anyone who loves to see all the different poses out there.the reason i didn't give this a 5 star review is that the binding on my book came off completely and all the pages are starting to fall out. will have to take to staples or some place like that to see if they can fix it. they squeezed too many pages into such a tiny book.other than that it's a great book, well worth the money!"
5,Asanas,I bought this small book when I volunteered at kripalu.It is very simple. Pictures of 608 asanas of the 900 poses that exist. My method in using it is to hold it in my hand while doing my flow. It works well for me.
1,Never arrived,"I never got the books due to a confusion. The book ""Power Yoga for Dummies"" I never ordered.I want the other 2 books though: Asanas and Light on Yoga.There are confusions all the time and I do not want to be overcharged due to Amazon's confusion.Thank you"
2,Asanas 608 Yoga Poses,"This is a book that has one asana on each page. It's a little thick book. If you practice yoga, you will find many poses you have never seen or done. Each pose has the sanskrit name and the english, but does not include anything else such as how to get into the pose. It is interesting by I don't use it in yoga. If you want a challenge, this might be your book."
5,A jewel,"This little book is beautiful as well as powerful. It is not an instruction book for beginners, but will certainly provide inspiration to anyone on the yoga path, no matter what their level of experience. For more experienced practitioners who seek to elevate their practice or add variety, this book is a gift. The photographs of Sri Mittra clearly show the pose from the best angle to see the necessary detail. Most of the photos were taken when Mittra was 45, but a few shots of a much older Mittra are a shining testament to the rejuvenating effects of a dedicated practice. Each photo illustrates Mittra's grace and strength and hints at a more spiritual aspect of the practice. Any serious student of yoga will consider this book a treasure."
1,Urban Geography - unprofessional seller,"I did not recieve the book I ordered. The seller sent me an old edition, and the ISBN number did not match the number I entered when I ordered the text. The cover does not match the cover on the website as advertised. When I talked to Amazon regarding the problem, they contacted the seller. The seller asked me to return the textbook for a refund minus shipping. That did not resolve my problem. Amazon did, however, help me out. They are sending me the correct textbook."
3,Amazing person - average book,"First I want to say the DVD included on this book is absolutley excellent. I read this after reading a biography of Sandy Weill of Citigroup and hearing of Alwaleed, then reading that he was ""self made"" and had gone to college in CA and was worth so much, I was interested. I got through half the book only however, and I am a pretty hardcore reader - currently reading an 800 page book Titan about John D. Rockefeller. What I wanted to know about most, his early business dealings it unfortunatley glazes over. I was interested how one could make so much money in contracting and specific recounts of these deals, however none were made. While I believe he made his fortune, painting a prince as totally self made and in some cases even an underdog is rediculous."
3,Good for younger children,"My daughter received this for her first birthday, because of the recommended age. She is not very interested in it and will only play with for a minute or two before selecting a different toy. I think that it would be much more appealing to a younger child. Some of the reviews state that they gave the toy to a child as young as 4 months, and I think that age is more appropriate. It is very sturdy and safe - no reason for a younger child to not be able to play with it."
1,Outdated and boring,This toy is too simplistic and archaic. It didn't keep the attention of my 6 month old for very long. We returned it for the Infantino Activity Triangle and have been having fun ever since.
4,One More Try,I LOOOOOOOOOVE the song One More Try!! It is a really good break-up - make-up song. Me and my Ex.. JASON used to listen to it all the time. That and ANGEL OF MINE by Monica. 2 Really really good songs that I cant listen to today with out thinking of him! :)
4,remembering a lady !.,"although dorothy's section was a small one, it was a very fitting tribute to a timeless beauty."
2,Less exploitive than McCoy or Conway..,"..this book still misses the boat on the truth about the celts, or Wicca, for that matter.Don't combine the two until you understand them both separately!"
2,Disappointing,"I've always found the concept of ""what do Black Americans think?"" interesting, so this book seemed like a god-send.Unfortunately, it's one man's opinion, simply written, with broad stereotypes (not negative stereotypes, just shallow thinking applied to a wide range of peoples). The writing suggests a dispassionate discourse by someone on the outside of Black culture, rather than in it. Nor does the author have a sociological bent. It's more like encyclopedia enteries for grade schoolers.The book is published by Trafford Publishing, which, I believe, means it didn't go through an editorial review, explaining the shallow treatment and many typos. On the one hand, vanity press lives up to the spirit of free speech, but the reality is that writing and writing well isn't easy. There are a lot of problems with traditional publishing, but at least there is normally a hint at quality control."
4,"Its big, its bad","A towel holder that stands on its on merit, you can yank a towel out and it don't budge. Would have gotten 5 stars but getting the knob off the shaft that holds the towel was a real bear the first time -- had to use a channel lock plier and left some slight indents."
1,Just trying to make money,"The biggest problem with this book is the it was written by a person who does not believe in God. He trys to make us think that Joseph Smith and Ron Lafferty are cut from the same cloth. He makes huge assumptions such as all mormons know the day and hour that Joseph Smith was murdered. He also attempts to create the illusion that somehow Latter Day Saints believe that grass is sacred and says that at BYU no one ever walks on the lawn. I wonder if Mr. Krakauer has ever even been to Provo, Utah. Here is another bad book that can be added to the long list of books written in an attempt to demean the Latter Day Saints. It makes me wonder what everyone is so afraid of, the truth, perhaps?"
2,"Review of ""Under the Banner of Heaven""","THis was a difficult book to read. It is hard to imagine that the Mormons could be so brutal, especially to women. I understand a lot of them are fundamentalist and there are many who are kind and have good values. I put it down half way through as I got tired of the same old theme."
3,Muddled,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a Mormon, and have no axe to grind one way or another. I read Into Thin Air and really enjoyed it. I think that this book is also well written.However, I didn't really understand the point of the book. If he was trying to convince me that religon drives people to kill then he didn't succeed. (By the way the 3 largest mass murders in recent history; Mao, Stalin and Hitler were all anti-religion. If he was trying to convince me that LDS encourages violence and incest, then the fact that all these sickos were expelled from the church refutes this. In short this was a book that was all dressed up with nowhere to go. He should stick to writing about the facts without trying to make a big statement."
5,Great History of Mormonism,"The first third of the book, a history of Mormonism, is one of the best I've read. The latter two thirds is a suspense-filled non-Fiction. As anything else Krakauer has penned, it is a pleasure to read."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Unfortunately, Mr. Krakauer presents a very one-sided story. I have no affiliation with the LDS, but was appalled by the unrestricted defamation provided in this book. Chapter after chapter I was hoping for any bit of positive insight, but found none.His research does appear to be in good form, but I would like to see this book on the shelves next to the supermarket tabloids do to the negative content. Every story has two sides. Good leaks from the pores of the worst of human deeds."
2,Boring .................,"To me, it's like a textbook, and not a story. The content is apalling; the young women's lives made miserable by sick-minded fathers ""marrying"" a number of their daughters when they reach their twelfth birthdays. Krakauer knows his subject, being brought up as a Morman. But enough is enough when it comes to sordid events described over and over again."
3,"Very entertaining, but just remember it is not very accurate","Very entertaining, and creative.Author writes his own opinion and assumptions, mixed with fact,(but that is his right).Thought provoking but not very accurate in many cases.Never knew so many nut cases lived in Utah,a pretty great state (G).Just so people know, this book is fiction and not fact.The author knows how to write novels that sell."
5,Undoubtedly too true for the God fearing,"I am an individual with solid Mormon ancestry on both sides. I believe that this is first book that seamlessly combines a starkly realistic and accurate account of Mormon history and militant Mormon fundamentalism. In the process, it demonstrates the relationship between the two and exposes the inevitable consequences of strongly held religious beliefs, consequences that are strewn through out history, but are here etched into dramatic relief by a religion conjured up only 170 years ago."
5,Under The Banner Of Heaven,Great book and with the election coming up and people wondering about Mitt Romney being a Mormon this book explains the beginning of the Religion!!
3,Under the Banner of Heaven,"The book pertains mostly to a history of Moron Fundamentalism with a convoluted tie-in to modern-day murders in Utah. The book uses a parallel-story format in which historical narrative is intermixed with a modern-day narrative as the chapters progress. Much of the historical narrative includes numerous names and places that are not particularly relevant to the overall story, serving mostly to interrupt what could have been a smoother narrative flow. A straight chronological format would have made for easier reading, but the author's attempt to add intrigue has slowed the pace and made the reading more confusing than necessary. For me, it was not a page-turner.As a non-Mormon, I read the book to try to get a snapshot of the major tenets of the modern Mormon church, but one cannot arrive at any informed opinions based on this book."
3,Kindle Review Only,"This review is for Kindle users only--the content of the book, like all of Krakauer's books, is worth at least 4 stars. Indeed, based on content, this is a 4.5 to 5 star book.Issues with the Kindle version:1. Footnotes in the text do not have footnotes included--the * in the text doesn't seem to be associated with any text.2. Prefatory section of the book, which includes a map and graphics, is unreadable on Kindle.The text itself in the Kindle version seems to be correct and legible. And, since Krakauer is simply so good, you might not miss these small details--as stated in the header, this review is just a watchout for the Kindle users."
2,COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO THE READER....,I REALLY want to listen to this book. I was raised a Mormon and love history about that church. However the first disc was difficult. The reader isn't that great and there are so many facts tossed out all at once about the history. The book is really about a murder and the killer was told by God to kill two people. So far the READER isn't helping and it's a shame. I hope it will get better on the 2nd disc or else I just won't make it through.
2,nonobjective,"I repect Mr. Krakauer as a writer, however, he has taken on a subject here that is ill served under his biased view.Thesis-antithesis-synthesis. He provides the first steps well, but admittedly is incapable of providing a synthesis to his work due to his anti-religious worldview.Until he has honed his skills to the level of scholarship and the ability to suspend his own prejudice to an acceptable level, he should avoid such controversial themes."
2,A Story of no Faith,"The book starts out telling the truth about some Mormon history.As the book progresses he quotes others and their disgust of religion,which many of us hate also hate.The replacement of gods best for us and mans best for us is unacceptable. He then leans on to a tree of knowledge, mans great wisdom. Later his attack on christianity and all those beliefs (except for giving us the modern day calendar) leaves you spinning. At the end of the book HIS truths come forth........they are....no hopes, worthy faiths, nothing except his wisdom and the culture he accepts."
3,Be balanced,"I am an active, practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The examination of extreme personalities is fascinating to me and Krakauer does a good job of delving into the lives of these people who went far astray. My only complaint is that the vast majority of his research comes from non-Mormons, many of whom are openly antagonistic of the LDS Church. Whatever happened to objective and balanced research? I only gave it three stars because of this reason. Like I said I enjoyed this book but encourage any uninformed reader to take it all with a grain of salt and also look to LDS sources for a more balanced approach to Mormon History. I highly recommend Richard Bushman's new book ""Joseph Smith - Rough Stone Rolling"" which can be purchased here on Amazon.com."
5,History is fact - ce'st la vie!,"I don't enjoy writing book reports, but I though it would be a great disservice not to refute some of the one/two star reviews out there. The point I would like to get across about this book is that re-hashing history is NOT bashing the people involved. Nearly every country and every people in the world have a shameful past in some respect; that doesn't mean no one should talk about it.It should also be noted that Krakauer did a good job of separating Mormons from the Mormon fundamentalists, and where necessary or not blindingly obvious, reiterated this difference.Everyone should read this book if only to see the vast extremes of personalities that co-exist in our little America."
5,What does this say about God's will?,"I loved this book simply because it asks us to delve into the difficult issues of faith, prayer and God's will. How do we know we are hearing God's will? These are tough issues I wish evangelical Christians struggled with more. We all seem so ""sure"" ... well these guys were sure... and they were WRONG. I love Krakauer's writing style."
5,Into the Mormons.,"This book regardless of how people feel certain leaders were portrayed, was very informational. I didn't know much about that religion besides what the media wanted me to know. Now I know more about who Joseph Smith was and what he accomplished, the difference between the LDS and FLDS, and even a little geography. Krakauer made the history of the LDS easy to follow, and I could trace their steps from the east coast all the way west. There's also (which I don't believe but was interesting to know) is how they thought the world was created.This is all just a background to the major piece of the book, which is a gruesome murder of a mother and a baby. Thanks to the information on the history and practices of the LDS/FLDS, I'm more able to make an educated opinion on what the media puts out and can now tell the difference between the extremists and the Mormons who just want to make the world a little nicer."
5,Compelling,"This book really left me marveling at the situation Mormons find themselves in - there is so much to recommend the culture that has grown up around the religion, and yet it's based on what is, to an outsider, silly stuff. I didn't understand until reading this the dynamics around the Smart kidnapping. The sexism which is inherent in LDS (fundamental or not) is invidious."
3,One-sided but interesting...,"I read this book when I was still a member of the LDS Church and although it did not make me leave this religion, it made me question what I believed. Now that I have a more neutral viewpoint, I feel that this book is very interesting from a historical/true-crime perspective, but it does not really give both sides of the story. I don't think Krakauer intended to smear the LDS Church with this book, but he kind of did anyway. This of course angered many of the Mormons around me, but a little criticism isn't bad so I think Mormons should just take this in stride and get over it. However, in the future, Krakauer should investigate multiple sides for the stories he writes to ensure more accuracy."
5,it could happen to you Too !,"this is a romantic comedy / drama from rags to riches kind of movie this is also a chick flick !!! its about a police officer and his snotty stuck up wife and a real sweet waitress . he offers her a lottery ticket because he did not have enough money to leave her a tip, and they agree to split the ticket if they win the New York State Lottery. wife finds out and gets upset and starts all kinds of problems,to find out what happens next you need to rent or buy this movie! if you are a movie collector this a must have movie . so grab the popcorn and your favorite drink and enjoy this movie, I give it a 10 plus a 5 star rating!"
4,relax and enjoy,"This movie is simply about two nice people who end up with crappy marriage partners and find each other. They fall in love and live happily ever after. Their ""exes"" get what they deserve. Hardly a complicated plot.After reading the good and bad reviews on this movie, it is disheartening to see how many people seem to think every movie must be neck deep in reality to be enjoyable. This movie is based on a true story - but it is only a movie! It's not a documentary nor intended to be. The critics must think that writers, directors, and actors are idiots because they can't see what's *wrong* with the script.It's the kind of movie you watch if you're a romantic or just want to believe the world isn't as crappy a place as it treated you today. So open a bottle of your favorite drink, take off your shoes, and sit back to see two good actors put a smile on your face."
2,Not enough features!,"Just checked the demo version - this program does nothing but saving passwords. It lacks most functions that are typical for similar programs:- There no possibility to drag the passwords to login pages.- No Search, no Sort- No file handling, Passwords are saved in a fixed folder.- Only one dimensional category list, no hierarchical structure.- No Password Generator- ...There is a lot of freeware and shareware that has more features. (e.g. Bagusoft Password Safe, Password Tresor, ...)"
5,Infinite,"Souls Of Mischief's debut album '93 'Til Infinity set the tone for years to come from this group, its members, and their Hieroglyphics crew. Members A-Plus, Opio, Phesto and Tajai hailing from Oakland, California giving lyrics and intuitiveness back to hip-hop/rap. Three songs produced by member A-Plus that gives a sense of the group having to take control of their own destiny with ""Never No More"", the title track and ""Anything Can Happen"". All but ""Make Your Mind Up"" contains all four members. ""Batting Practice"" is not practice what so ever, but a display of skills of the Souls. As they all team up on sharing verses on ""Disseshowedo"" its more than apparent that Souls Of Mischiefis noteworthy of their talents and ability to feed off one another. This is not commercial, this is not mainstream, this is hip-hop! No additives, no preservatives. Just 14 tracks of good music."
4,Works as advertised,"I have one of those flat-floor, large all-tile showers.. it was so slippery I was afraid for my life. Went through two rubber mats with suction cups and some stick on rough strips.. all worthless... so I used this and you know what? It really does the trick. The result is a surface that looks and almost feels the same as before but once you stand on it when wet you can tell its not slippery anymore. My only beef is the price... how can it really cost that much for a tiny vial of some liquid... and I have been unable to track down what the chemical ingredients are... probably something really inexpensive right? anyway. IT WORKS!"
2,This album is over rated.,"Support the independent brothers, but do not fool yourself, this album is not ALL THAT."
5,I LOVE PASTOR TROY!!!,Pastor Troy has this style of thinking that is much more complex than the average rapper. He has so much power in his voice. His songs make you feel where he is coming from. I am anticipating to hear his next album. I know it will be crunk. Damn these haters out here. Believe me; it's all good!
5,DOWN SOUTH,"I heard it one weekend when I was in Atlanta, I have been playing it every since I bought it. The Dude got skills, this album will have you CRUNK ATL Style. All the ATL people will agree with me on this one, it is 559 type of music, crunk..............He Ready He ready he ready......."
2,"Some good information, but a little crude","I got this book to affirm my choice to be a stay at home mom. I am so blessed that I can stay home, but sometimes the drudgery gets to me...as it does so many other moms/housewives. I wanted to try to focus on the blessings of being home and taking care of my family, instead of the negatives. This book has some very good information to offer, but the author can be very crude and negative. Some of the words she uses really turned me off, and I ended up putting the book away because of it. I get it back out sometimes if I need a little pick me up, but I try to focus on the good parts and skim over the bad. Overall, I would not recommend this book. One that is full of the positives about being a mom without the negatives is ""The Momstown Guide to Getting it All"". Would definitely recommend that one over this one."
4,great debut,"there's a couple of tracks that i skip over, but for the most part this was a great debut. another classic to anyone's cd collection."
1,"Save $10, Buy the Real Deal Instead","This manual is a waste of your money. You can buy both the actual book and the movie on Amazon for less than $25 combined, and they're both worth every penny...."
4,Enteric coated,"This an economy size bottle of the basic enteric coated stuff. If you can't easily find an economy sized bottle in a local store this is OK. I have been taking 2 enterics at bedtime for 30 years for arthritis, with no side effects and the added benefit of blood thining and heart health. Likely all the brands come from a single huge factory somewhere, it's the size and name on the bottle that controls price."
5,Good case.,"This case is well designed, the clasp needs to be tweaked a little, closure is tight when first used. OK, though..."
3,It's ok,"Not enough sticks, only good for one round of test. But the test results seem to be accurate and easy to use."
4,Water tests,Easy to use but I did wonder at the hard water results of the test. My water is very hard and I do not think the results reflected that.
2,only one test strip?,I purchased this kit to get a better understanding of my water chemistry as I am a home brewer. This kit comes with a single paper cromatography strip for each attribute it tests. For $25 i expect either more than a single test strip or much more precise readings. To be fair it is VERY easy to use and VERY straight forward. But I just can't get over the single use aspect of this kit.
3,Tells you if you need professional analysis,"A good product to tell you if you MIGHT have a problem. Cost is right but, you need to talk to a person well versed on the subject of well water contamination. My suggestion is to talk to a professional at your state university system, which I did. He helped me interpret my test results and go the next step to find professional help."
1,overpriced,The test results for bacteria turned out wrong when I compared it to the test I turned into the city for just $10.00Sorry i bought it.
5,Faithful to this one,"Its been awhile, but i've listening to this one here a lot lately. From the opening track to the final song, it's easy to see that with ""Faithful"". Hi Five comes into there own on this cd. Some of the key songs for me: As One, What Can I Say to You (Justify My Love) w/Nuttin' Nyce, I'm in Need and Unconditional Love. This is a cd that i can folks should not sleep on in any sense of the word.The only complaint that i really have with this cd is that its way too short. I mean only eight songs and its over in less than 40 minutes that however doesnt stop me from really enjoying and listening to what this cd has to offer. If your fan of Hi Five and don't have this CD. You should really give it a shot and even if your not. After one listen you'll be all into Hi Five like they were just released the other day.Faithful has all types of songs, uptempo, mid and slow jams that will rock your ears.Enjoy!!"
3,TOOOOO LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I winded up returning this fan. It was just tooooo loud. We couldn't even hear the TV set while it was running on Low. As far as power, it is very strong, and does give off a lot of air flow, but it's just too loud. THANK YOU FOR THE FAST SHIPPING!!"
3,Good enough,"We have three of these fans in a server room to blow air around a dead spot, they move allot of air but are not balanced well and if they are not strapped into place they will soon vibrate themselves across the room. We've had them for over two years and one is now dead. The vibration overcame the strength of the metal cage around the fan blade and at points around where the motor is attached to the cage the bars have snapped. So after 15,000 hours the motor is still fine but it is no longer attached to the cage. Time for a new fan."
1,POOR QUALITY CAGE,"Ran it overnight and the cage started rattling. Weld on one of the cirrcular veins came loose. Exchanged it via amazon. Ran second fan overnight no problem. Second night SAME PROBLEM... Weld on cage came loose and started rattling.Does a good job moving air. However, I would not recommend this fan because of the rattling."
3,Back assembly broke very easily,"I bought two of these fans for the inside of my horse barn. They work fine, but today, I hit one with my knee, and it fell over backwards.with that easy fall, the entire back assembly broke. Shattered really. After that, the fan would not work AT ALL. The entire thing is broken in the back, the little turn knob that sets the speed.I'm very disappointed, because, for that price, the fan should be sturdier than that. One tiny nudge, and a fall over, and it's broken forever? for $100.00?I will not buy this fan again, unless they agree to replace it for me....I am going to write to them.signed, A horsewoman in Pennsylvania"
5,Classic - One of Hip Hop Top Ten,"Criminal Minded started a brilliant career, but the issues KRS addressed in Boom Bap are immortal. Sound of the Police should replace the national anthem...Black Woman...Mortal Thought...Boom Bap orginal rap. If you don't know - ask KRS!!"
3,"KRS's worst, but that's still not bad","This album is the first one Kris put out as himself. It is altogether good, but is lacking in a few areas.One of these problems is the production. Even though most of it is done by D.J. Premier, it is underproduced and a little boring. It sounds like they were stretching for beats, like on ""Uh Oh,"" where they use an annoying vocal loop.The lyrics are good, but not his best. The album does have many great tracks, like the classics ""Sound of the Police,"" and ""Can't Wake Up.""This is KRS at his worst(that I've heard), but it's still good. If you want Kris at his best, get ""Criminal Minded"", or more recently, ""KRS-One."""
4,"Boom Bap, original rap!","I first heard of Kris on the track 'Hush' (from tony hawks III) and immediately bought this album. It's a good album but I don't think it's worth the 'best album of the 90's' label some reviewers have given it. Classic Tracks on the album are 'KRS-One Attacks' (if only it was longer), 'Outta Here', 'Mortal Thought (Amazing first verse) and I really like 'Brown Skinned Woman'. This is good stuff, but I think he can do better. This Albums made me wanna get a more recent one, to see if he really IS as good as everyone says he is!Anyway, the best album of the 90's is 'It takes a nation of millions to hold us back' Public Enemy forever!"
4,Another Hard to Find Item - Land Before Time,My sons loved this. More songs to sing along with. I only wished it was available on DVD.
5,A great cookbook,"A friend served several receipes from this cookbook and I liked them so much that I bought the book for me and a book for another friend. Recipes are flavorful, not complicated and ingredients don't require an extra trip to some specialty store. Everything I've tried so far has been a great crowd pleaser. Great pictures throughout. I would recommend if you're looking for new recipes!"
3,I wouldn't buy it,"I ordered this Bible from amazon.com. The black, calf skin leather cover was soft and supple. It was just the right size for carrying with you and for preaching. The three stars I gave it are for the leather and cover. When I opened the Bible, I was terribly disappointed. The pages were not at all attractive. If presentation is the key in food preparation, how much more an expensive Bible? There are no center column references and the two columns of text only were just flat out ugly. Nelson has always printed the NKJV in verse form but the verses are not indented. Instead of being helpful, it is confusing and ugly. I understand Nelson has taken to printing the NKJV in paragraph form. That's what should have been done with this Bible. You'd think that a publishing company that has been in the business as long as Thomas Nelson & Sons would know how to print a book that has eye appeal. I was so disappointed with the inside of this Bible that I returned it."
3,"interesting premise and form, but....","From reading the description of this book (I resisted reading any reviews until after I was done reading it.) I expected a dream-like quality and a surrealistic fairy-tale quality. And these things attract me. It has those qualities, and I found the form interesting, but had a hard time getting through this book. I found it difficult to determine the dream from the reality (although maybe that was the point?), and some of the writing was full of beautiful images but I didn't know what the meaning behind the images was."
2,...and so was I,"I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was ""different"", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed."
2,"TWIN mom- son hated his seat at 4 mo, daughter at 5 mo.","I love my Peg Perego Duette stroller, and the Primo Viaggio car seats snap right into it, so I was happy as a clam, until 4 months, when my son was so ""hunky"" that he no longer fit into the seat. I had to buy a convertible car seat for him (which is not even as nice as the clip in's because you have to completely take the baby out EVERY time you run an errand). My daughter is more petite, but she got fussy in her car seat by the age of 5 months. I know people with the graco car seat system and they are 7 months along and STILL fit in the car seat. So, I truly wish this seat would have been wider. I agree with other reviews, these seats weigh a lot too."
3,Read this before you buy,"I have the Peg Perego car seat and matching Peg Pereo Milano stroller which are very beautiful and fit very well together. However, the travel combo is too heavy to lift when you are just recovering from pregnancy. It's also very cumbersome when inside and is difficult to fit past the racks at most department stores. I decided to get the Snap n Go (the infant seat snaps right on to a wheel base to convert to a stroller) but the Peg Perego is the ONLY car seat doesn't work with it. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. If I had to do over I would buy another brand that worked with the snap n go.Also the Primo Viaggio is very heavy compared to other brands. If you put it in the center seat of an SUV you will break your back getting the seat with baby in and out once baby is past 10 pounds."
3,Expensive isn't always better,"It looks great, but in our Subaru was impossible to level. Trip to a car seat safety seminar elicited the info these are designed for European cars, with flatter seats. Solution was a chunk of swim noodle under the base at fold of car seat (the installation manual gives no help on this - it suggested loosening the harness - ouch.) I also have trouble getting the carrier out of the base without violent shaking. Baby won't be here for 3 more weeks, but I suspect this will be a problem! (...) but I still wish we'd bought the easier Graco."
3,Not the best...........,"I bought this car seat to go along with my Venezia stroller. I am highly disappointed. It is one of the safest car seats out there, so that is a plus. But on the other hand, it is such a small seat. My daughter is 3 months old and only weight 10.5 pounds. She barely fits in it. It is not wide enough. My daughter is on the small side, how is an average sized baby supposed to fit in it. Given another chance, I don't know if I would've bought it."
2,too many problems for the price,"For the price I paid for this car seat, I wouldn't have expected so many problems. The canopy doesn't cover the babies face as far at it should and continues to slide back as the baby is pushed in a stroller or snap-n-go. The handle is very hard to move and the head rest never stayed in the shape it was suppose to. After putting my infant in the car seat, I would have to spend several minutes trying to fix the head rest around his head. Lastly, the fabric is very hot and the seat is heavy. Save your money and go with a less expensive seat."
3,Don't get this car seat,"My son is 13 weeks old and 24 inches. It seems like the car seat is already too small for him. He likes being in the car but not the car seat. As another reviewer mentioned, the material seems to make him feel hot and uncomfortable. After being in the car for a little while he cries and wants to get out. After spending [this much], we have to go out and get a bigger more comfortable car seat."
1,Very Disappointed,"I chose Peg Perego because I wanted the best for my first baby. Plus it was the only brand that had descent colors. I didn't want navy plaid. What a waste of money. The seat is very heavy and the base is very difficult to install. If tightening the baby in while the seats already in the car the plastic around the release button pops off every time. I bought the Atlantico, Peg Perego stroller to go with the carseat, also very disappointing. The way the straps are designed with a piece of plastic that hooks them to the back of the stroller seat is a total design flaw. Now that my baby is 3 months old and can sit up the plastic stabs her in the back of the head. All Peg Perego strollers have the same strap design. I would get rid of the stroller and buy some other kind if I didn't pain nearly $$$ for it!!!"
1,worst carrier EVER,"this is a review from a father who has been using this for over 3 years on 2 children.I wish I can give 0 star! but there is no option for one star.the shoulder padding constantly rotates and eventually the shoulder strap digs into your shoulder. THERE IS NO WAY TO STOP THIS!.IF you don't mind the shoulder strap digging into your shoulder and having bruises, go ahead and purchase this. otherwise STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE!!!!"
3,Seventh movie in the series better that the last three.,"This is an entertaining prequel to the entire series. Andre Toulon tells the puppets from the first 6 movies about their ancestors and how he learned ""the secret of life"".Exceptionally bad acting, even for Puppet Master movies. Oh yeah, and let's not forget the standard lack of consistency with the rest of the Puppet Master mythology. However, if you're a fan of the series you already expect these things. Far superior to the embarrasing sixth film, Curse of the Puppet Master."
1,Are They Crazy???,Retro Puppet Master had to be one of THE worst movies ever. It's not even worth watching unless you like watching hot guys crash in burn in such a horrible movie. I feel awfully bad that the lead cast as Andre Toulon as a young man had to make his first lead in such a bad film. Don't even waste your time and money on this movie. Full Moon Pictures really know how to drag a movie series untill it really burns!
4,Better than Average,The costume I received was definately Better than Average and worth the money. I received the costume in the timeframe expected and was not disappointed when it arrived. I would buy again from this seller.
1,Not as relaxing as it was described to be,Still listening as I am hoping with repeated listening things will help. I will say compared to other subliminal CD's it is not very soothing and relaxing. Its rather loud and I would recommend not using when trying to sleep (as I normally do with the others)
3,Thank goodness for Jesse Stone and Sunny Randall...,"...I always look forward to the latest Spenser novel and pre-order it from Amazon as soon as it appears. Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of suspense here - while there was some mystery as to ""whodunnit,"" there was no real sense of urgency or danger. Sad to say, this seemed more like a decent episode of ""Law & Order"" than the latest and greatest from Mr. Parker. I, too, look forward to the next installment - but give us some more Jesse Stone and Sunny Randall, too!"
3,I caught a typo!,"I'm not one to gloat, but sometimes I just can't help myself! On page 288, line 16, the word ""now"" appears. I'm 99% certain that the word should be ""low."" I can't give the scene away to explain, since the plot depends on it. It's definitely not Parker's best Spenser novel by far, but it's still entertaining."
3,"Ahhh, Refreshing","Parker rebounds nicely from the disappointing Potshot, putting Spenser back where he belongs - in Boston, and away from the dirtballs that populated Potshot (well, okay, we do have to put up with a cameo from Vinnie Morris but it's tolerable). The only real let-down is that Rita Fiore has gone to the dark side and become a criminal defense lawyer. Otherwise, we have standard Spenser fare - highly entertaining and able to be read in one sitting."
3,depressing!,"Although I found this story to be well written and imaginative, I thought the subject matter was depressing. Here was a yo9ung woman with her whole life ahead of her making a drastic decision and following it through. If every woman who lost a loved one in a war did likewise, we would have a much smaller population. I just did not care much for this story!"
4,"Not a Pulitzer, but still a good read.","If one takes the photograph of Parker on the back of the dust cover seriously, I would say the man is looking quite healthy for someone who is turning 70 this year. It is too bad his writing hasn't kept pace. While this novel isn't his best, it is most assuredly a lot better than Hugger Mugger. It does show that he is still capable of giving us the kind of action and plot structure we have come to expect of him.Like others, I am glad to see Parker is now writng about other characters, especially Jesse Stone. It is indeed time for Spenser to retire."
1,THIS CD IS SO BAD AT BASKETBALL,"This cd sucks dik like its its job....lets be serious shaq can not rap for his life. the names of his songs and the ryhmes in it like ""i dont give a heck"" and i kno i got (skills), i want to just puke all over that and finish it off with a taco boat w/flag desert.....if u buy this cd immediately go play in traffic afterwards with the cd in ur hands...and if u own this cd already idk wut to tell u throw in the rap towel immediately i guess is the most appropriate thing... peace 1 bitchez"
2,"Meh, the thought was nice.","My friend and I absolutely love Captain Jean Luc Picard, and so when I saw this online I had to order Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.It didn't really smell how I expected. It had more of a chemically smell rather than what I had hoped for (the smell of a strong cup of tea!)Still, it was passable and I guess it's the thought that counts."
1,No Zing in my Ring!!!,"Save your money!!! Impossible to use. After wasting 4 hours trying to create 1 ringtone, I took the disc and converted it into a coaster. Try something else."
1,terrible program / no support,"This program was extremly hard to use! Even when you could try to figure out a few things, it did not work right!What a terrible buy.SENT IT BACK!Called tech support for help, WHAT A JOKE! They could care less about anything.I will never buy another product made by this company!!!!!"
2,Not Happy,"The program is somewhat difficult to use and the online tutorials and help does not seem to be up. I believe the product says it will work with all major phones, I have a very popular LG phone and the program will not work with it. I find it very confusing, but am still trying to figure it out."
4,One of the best of Mayall version 2,"As a Mayall fan of the original albums, I added John Mayall's albums back into the fold after 'Sense of Place' and I have every one since. 'Wake up call' is memorable for many reasons not the least for the guitar of Coco Montoya and Mick Taylor. The stand out tracks include 'Nature Disappearing' a rework of an earlier Mayall track which features the magical playing of Coco Montoya and 'Not at home' a great song featuring Mick Taylor. Also check out the live album 'Life in the jungle' as possibly the best Mayall album."
4,"Good reference book, but it's time for next edition!","This book is one of the very good reference books for UMTS as a starter. The history, UTRAN, Core network has been described very well. But the books seems to be more focussed on R99 architecture, It's almost time to have an updated edition giving more stress on the Distributed switch architecture, Soft switch, IP Multimedia subsystem etc.There needs to be detailed chapter on HSDPA."
5,The Night Stalker DVD,"This is an excellent DVD.I was and I am a fan of this series.The series had comedy,drama,suspense,and horror.Darren McGavin was brilliant as Kolchak.Simon Oakland was equally brilliant as Vincenzo. The interplay between the two characters were excellent.Too bad this series did not last longer than one season.I would also like to purchase the original Night Stalker and the Night Strangler as well.Yet it cost too much. However this DVD is worth the price I paid for it."
2,Night Vision Needed For Night Stalker,"As much as I love the original Night Stalker series I am extremely disappointed with this DVD release. The night scenes, bar scenes and any scene shot in low light are very dark and pretty much unviewable. I hope in the next year or two the studio re-releases this series first taking the time to digitally remaster it to lighten up the dark scenes. I love Night Stalker but this release is not worth the money."
4,Killer Kolchak,"I was really keen on getting this series since I looked forward to it every wk when I was a ten yr old. True, most of the scares I thrilled to back then now seem kinda hokey (especially the last show whose Barney/Sleestack-like reptile is downright comical), but Mr. McGavin & Mr. Oakland are solid & the atmosphere (greatly aided by a shivering soundtrack) is consistently unique in TV eerieness. Caveats: no extras & some episodes seem prone to freezing up disc-wise (especially the last 1 or 2 on each disc). This is NOT a DVD player problem. I have multiple top of the line players which have frozen repeatedly in the same spots, requiring tedious skipping to nxt scenes & then reversing back to just after frozen pts. What a drag! Nonetheless, I still highly recommend the series but thumbs down on the technical integrity of the manufacturing."
5,Kolchak-The Nighstalker,They arrived in excellent condition and in quick time. I was very happy with it. Thank you.Charlotte Christensen
3,Not as expected,"I received this sampler pack and even though it had ten products in the bag, none of them other than the lip balm were the ones mentioned in the description. I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try something different."
2,Fast paced book...,"The French Revolution made it a crime to be rich, and Alix de la Brou was guilty. After her father's savage death, she sets off to the hoped for safety of her mother's house in England. She can't make it there on her own, she needs help, in the form of Rafe Harerest. However, her life is not the only thing at risk, her reputation is as well. The only thing that will save that is a marriage that turns very convenient when passion turns it into a real one. No matter how great the heat between Rafe and Alix, it will take danger and testing to prove their love true.** Danger and passion fill this fast paced book. Alix seems a bit flippant and shallow at times, but Rafe has all the earmarks of a hero, albeit rakish. **Amanda Killgore"
2,Misses the Mark,"I was expecting to hear some extremely original and great music, but this definitely misses the mark. This is an artist trying to sound like other artists, SRV, John Mellencamp, etc. If you were to hear this music you would know its wasn't the artists he is trying to sound like, and probably wouldn't want to hear repeatedly. His voice is fairly weak and indistinct and his guitar is so muddied it is hard to tell what he is trying to achieve. He might be fun to see at your local pub on a Saturday night, but if you like good rock and good blues, buy something by SRV, Eric Clapton, or Gary Moore. I thought this was going to be a revelation, but the only thing it revealed; listen to Johnny Lang for better vocals, guitar, and arrangements; for a young up and comer. This CD is going back to the store for an exchange or trade, but it won't be spinning in the player."
5,This book is a work of art!!!,"I highly recommend SWIMMING TOWARD THE OCEAN. The author is a master at storytelling and the book is broken up into Parts, rather than chapters and this worked so well. Within each part there were short passages which made it a good read to pick up and set down.The captivating and descriptive life of the immigrant family represented in this story was so real. I felt like I had actually met Chenia (the main character) and felt her disgust for her husband, Ruben. The story also spans many years which is fun in a book - to see where everyone is years from the beginning of the book. The title was perfect and the cover of the book plays in your mind as you read this book. It was as if the book was a work of art, IMHO."
2,Not strong like an EDP should be.,"I don't care for the smell, I was thinking it would be more like a green apple scent but it was very disappointingly week scented and not pleasent like a perfume should be. The scent lasted less than the EDT did! Save your money on this one!"
3,Not as good as i hoped,This scent was not as good as I thought it would be. Not the nice apple scent I was looking for. But I've had much worse. I will wear it. But I won't order more. Her chocolate scent is great.
2,Beware if you have little ears,"I bought these in the hopes of using them when I work out. For the most part, the sound seems fine, but if you have small ears - I do - then I would suggest finding a different pair of headphones. I have tried to bend the clips so that they'll stay on my ears, and it's not really that good. My husband, on the other hand, can wear these just fine without any manipulation whatsoever! (He has normal-sized ears.) He thought I just didn't know how to put them on - even after I was wearing them. Now he knows that it's because I have very small ears."
3,You will NOT be getting what you see in the picture!,"The actual product in the picture (the maroon one) I bought from Best Buy AND came with a nifty plastic case which has been supremely useful for preserving the product (I had these semi-cheap earphones for over 2 years of active use at the gym and on vacations!).The product I received was black of a similar shape, but the cord was about 1 inch shorter than the previous one I had and did NOT come with the plastic case. Also, the curved ear hoop part was a tiiiiny bit smaller, about 1-2 mm smaller, which may or may not make a difference depending on how sensitive your ears are.In terms of fit, it may take a long while (it took me about 6+ months of fiddling with it a bit every time I used it), but with enough manipulation, you can kind of get them to fit in your ear securely.Also, I don't know if it's just me but the sound does not seem to be as good as with my older maroon ones! :("
2,"Sturdy, but otherwise not that great","I've been using these headphones for a few months at the gym.Pros:- They are sturdy and well-made.- Sweat does not seem to bother them.Cons:- They don't fit well in my ears. I don't have a problem with most earbuds, so this is unusual. The buds are large and the earpieces don't give much support on me - they fall out easily.- The earpieces are not adjustable.- The sound is just not good when they're not in your ear canal. No bass at all, and the other frequencies are muddy.Summary:I would not recommend these for those looking for good sound. I would also not recommend these for people doing vigorous activity where they're likely to fall out."
3,"Dimensional Flowers, Leaves & Vines",This is a new experience for me. The new techniques are a challenge but the instructions are detailed enough for a beginner with a passion for beadwork. Thanks.
5,Love it!,this shows the heart of a real person that shows his character through love and laughter. It is an inspiring story.
5,Beyond Incredible!!!!,"This was the most amazing movie that I have ever seen!!!! I cried through the whole movie, yet I was laughing at the same time!! I cannot begin to say how incredible the movie was. Robin Williams was brilliant in this. Just go see it!!!"
1,Sickening and manipulative,"An insulting vehicle displaying how great a person Robin Williams is. I can't believe anyone wouldn't want to take a shower after the scene where the ""terminally ill"" children show up to his hearing with the red noses on. How bad of a movie maker do you have to be to take a true story and make it unbelieveable. It's ironic that a movie which touts non-conformity is made up of formula and cliche. If you liked this movie, you need to examine your life and appreciation of art."
4,Excellent movie.......made me laugh and cry.,"This movie was very touching....and the fact that it was based on a true story was even more moving. I thought it was very well put together. Another person wrote that it was a stupid movie, because they kept trying to make you cry......apparently it worked and that's why they were upset. But, in reality they were just telling a real life story...... and life isn't always happy and sunny.....that's just reality.....but, I do believe they did a good job of balancing the laughter and the tears. Great movie.....I would watch it again......and again.....and again. :o)"
3,"Price was the catch, skipping/lag in movie not mentioned","So I have seen this movie before but on VHS. I wanted to add this movie to my collection of movies.I liked the price and that's what made me decide to get it. HOWEVER, the seller forget to mention there was lagging in this particular dvd. Most of the movie was fine except some parts where the movie would lag and freeze and skip part of the movie."
5,The best comedy-drama of the year!!!!!,I think Patch Adams is one of the greatest movies of the year. Robin Williams is at his best in the movie.The movie teaches you to stand up for what believe in. A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,A Disappointment...,"After Robin Williams's Oscar winning performance in ""Good Will Hunting,"" it is depressing to see him in such a trite, predictable film. Though ""Patch Adams"" isn't without its amusing moments, these scenes aren't enough to sustain the movie. The film attempts to manipulate the audience with cliches and over-the-top emotional zeal, the worst being the scene with the butterfly. Okay, maybe that's NOT the worst...the scene in which Patch defends his right to graduate goes way too far. It is clearly included to give Patch one more chance to stand on his soap box, and it is, perhaps, the least necessary part of the film. Also, the attempt to recreate the emotional pathos delivered successfully at the end of ""Dead Poets Society"" (when the students all stand on their desks to show their support for their teacher) by having former patients come into the room wearing clown noses falls flat. Overall, I do not recommend this film."
1,Phony,The worst acting I have ever seen. I didn't believe a bit of the end sequence. The whole thing just stunk.
1,Shameless Film Will Do Anything For A Tear,"Quite possibly the most vile, manipulative tearjerker ever foisted upon the American public. Anyone who was actually moved by this film should have their head examined. It's the two-hour equivalent of those starving children infomercials, only here it's bald little cancer children. Guess Hitchcock was right - you can play the audience like a piano..."
4,"GOOD, but wishful thinking.",This was a good movie. I liked it a lot.It deals with going against the rituals of programedliving.
4,slippery blueberries,"This soundtrack album is filled with gems. Why and how they put this cd together is beyond me, but it is filled with soul and wonderful tunes that probably fit the movie, but their compendium into an album does not make total sense to me. How does Ruth Brown fit with the others? What brings these songs together. I have a feeling that they were culled from someone's favorite records. Norah Jones maybe and used as a background to the movie, but they are too good to be background music. So how this came together is beyond me, but now that it is together it is a great cd of seemingly unrelated tunes. excellent. jack w."
2,Rambled,The book rambled. I have yet to get to the part where there is anything but roaming around. It is rather unclear what the relationships between the various obscure characters are. I may not finish it.
5,"A beautiful, entrancing narrative","Reading ""Alias Grace"" was an incredible experience. While I was made aware of the premise by the person who recommended the book, I was anticipating the focus to be entirely on Grace. I was not prepared for the emotional spiraling of Dr. Jordan, and many times found that I had to stop reading after a few pages to fully process what was happening with and to him. One of the few contemporary novels to elicit from me such a reaction. A truly breathtaking gem."
4,the audio-book is enchanting,"Elizbeth McGovern's reading is 5+ stars. Her accent is mesmerizing, and she turns the descriptive passages into believable poetry. A beautiful work."
4,"History, Mystery, and Murder","This book is a whodunnit with no answer at the end. It is a fictionalized account of an actual convicted (and later pardoned) murderess named Grace Marks. Grace was a 16-year old servant accused of killing her employer and his mistress in the mid-1880s.Margaret Atwood has done an excellent job of researching the events surrounding the murder and the time period that she describes. She changes no facts, but as history was not as well documented in the 1800s, the facts are few. This is where Ms. Atwood takes the poetic license that makes this such a good book.Highly recommended."
2,Difficult and disappointing,"Margaret Atwood is my favorite author. But if you want to read her best work, read Life Before Man, not this unnecessairily dense and pointless tome. I have felt that ever since Atwood ""sold out"" to Hollywood for the HORRIBLE, SOULESS film of Handmaid's Tale, she has lost something significant as an artist and this book simply proves that. I was especially disappointed by the TEAM of people she had working for her on this book. Is that how ART is created these days? With corporate teamwork? I have been shocked at the great reviews for this book. As if people have been blinded by the sheer size of the book and Atwood's reputation. Don't buy into that. If you must read this book (and believe me, you won't miss anything by not) save your money and get it from the library. At least then if you can't bear to finish it, you can take it back!"
2,Annoying,"I really thought I would enjoy this, I love atwood. But it just turned out to be a re-telling of this true story about fifteen times with nothing revealed at the end of it all. There is no signature feminist cry underlying the story. And the character of the psychologist helping Grace didn't go with the rest of the story at all. The worst thing was that Atwood didn't delve into Grace's character. All we knew about her was what everyone else did and a few banal inner thoughts she let us see. I was hoping she would at least speculate on what really happened. But I knew no more about the murder after reading than I did before."
4,Story was beautiful and captivating,"The book on audio tape was giving to me as a birthday present. I was captivated from the beginning of the story and it kept my desire for more even after the story ended. It was beautifully written and wonderfully acted! If you enjoyed this book, you MUST listen to its audio tape!Margaret Atwood's story telling skill has hit an all-time high. I highly recommend this book!The story of Grace gave me a glimpse of life in the 1800s from a poor girl's point of view. The descriptions are so well done that I can place myself it the place and almost smell the scent being described.I was a bit disappointed at the end, perhaps it was because I wanted it to go on, perhaps I was disappointed at how it ended; I haven't quite decided since I just finished it last night.This story has changed my diary writing style (:"
5,Alias Grace,"Loved this book. Many twists and turns. Even at the end, the reader is left with the question, ""What is the truth?"""
5,Tuntsa,"I found this at a used book sale and what a find it was. Very well written, the characters are extremely likeable and it is one of those rare books that you hate to have end. It goes with my elite collections of read-again books."
3,Not what I expected,"Guess I was expecting something different with this book, but it was really quite difficult to play 80% of the songs on the fiddle. I did however get to use it with my mandolin, so it wasn't a complete waste of money."
3,wont stay on music stand,"Finding the book to large and heavy to stay on the music stand....Its was in very nice shape (like new) shipped on time, I was disappointed to find more celtic tunes than blue grass but over all lots of music in here."
5,Big help for jam sessions,"This book is a ""must have"" for those interested in joining a jam session. My daughter and I recently joined an ""old time"" fiddle session in our local city. We were told to purchase this book, as it would help us along in getting familiar with tunes that the group would be playing. I was impressed with the enormity of the selections and the good variety. The music is classified as Old time, blue grass, Irish,English, etc. We went home after our first session visit and found most of the tunes they played in the book. This book will provide a life time of exploration and enjoyment! I highly recommend it!"
2,Dissappointed in Contents,"The book goes from the very basic stokes to the very difficult jumps. It was a disappointment to me as it did not illustrate or describe the ""how to's"" This is not an instructional book but rather a book for spectators or parents rather than the student skater."
5,GREAT JUST AS EXPECTED,HOUSEKEEPER HAS A LOT OF MARVINS SONGS THAT WE LIKE.WE WILL BE REVIEWING AND ORDERING MORE OF HIS MUSIC.
4,"Great sound, but could be improved","Okay, I've had this album for a few years and now I can tell you about it. Some songs are really great, some songs I would like to forget. The best track on the album is definitely ""U ain't gotta lie to kick it"". It's got a great sound that you can dance to. Other up tempo songs that should be worth your time are ""Down 4 whateva, Froggy Style, In my nature"". Their best ballads are ""Don't make me wanna do U and En tu deep"". The collaboration with Hi-Five surely was a good thing, although the song takes some ""gettin' used to"". As for the overload of interludes, I skipped them. You will get nothing out of track 16, 17 and 18, but the rest of the album was a real treat to me. I wonder why there never was a second one."
4,The Amazing Noodle,"While other reviews have focused on the music on this disc, none have mentioned something about this disc that I find just as enjoyable as the music if not more! Take this CD and put it in the CD-ROM drive of your pc or mac. There is a program contained on the disc called noodle. When you open and use this program, it allows you to create your own afro-celt grooves by using samples of beats and intrument sound bites of Afro Celt Sound System - all displayed and munipulated on a visual ""palette"" that is easy to use. This program is worth the price of the disc alone...as it allows you to really personalize the listening experience. It's also much fun!"
2,A couple of cheap laughs.,"A couple of cheap laughs, but not much else. Pretty much got what I expected."
2,TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL,"The people who would enjoy this film are barred from watching it due to the rating. This is an immature sexual romp. High School kids are attending a very hip sex education class. The viewer is treated to a number of skits similar to ""Groove Tube"" but with sex being the constant theme. Poorly written and edited. Go watch ""Grove Tube"" or ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" instead.F-bomb, sex, nudity"
4,Kidulthood Stupid Funny Comedy,"Funny, stupid, entertaining movie of teens playing it hard-or trying to-and their helpful parents which makes this work even better.Much more to watch and to be entertained with thanSex Driveoffers."
3,Not very original,"If you've been reading Slashdot, EFF's newsletter, or similar news sources, you have already read most of the valuable ideas that are in this book.If you know very little about the political issues raised by recent changes in technology, the first three quarters of this book might be as good a place as any to introduce yourself to the discussions that have been floating around the net.The last quarter of the book deals with broader political issues where the author has no more expertise than a typical reporter, and is at least as superficial as what you'd find in a typical newspaper article. For instance, he says ""The World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which exercise wide-ranging influence over the lives of billions of people in developing nations, clearly work for the interests of the developed nations."" I say that they work for a much narrower set of interests, and are probably somewhat harmful to developed nations as a whole."
3,tight,"fear itself is another quality addition to the hiero camp. casual hits you with tight flows and changes his style from time to time to keep himself fresh. some of his punch lines made me laugh out loud. but by the time i'd owned this album for a year or two, a few of the songs i had to FF through. at points the cd staggers a bit, with a string of about three songs sounding the same. otherwise this is an album i'm happy to have in the collection--the last third of the album, when casual's hiero peers join him, is definitely the high point. to me this proves that he's better with the team, rather than carrying the game himself. on another note, though, his production on this and other hieroglyphic albums really stands out."
3,casual nonchalance,"i bought this at the advice of a friend. i'm not sorry i listened to that friend, but i can't put casual on the same pedastal.casual has flow for days. prides himself on the art of freestyle. but freestyles are usually unfocused (quips and jaw-dropping insults that'll test your REW button). and that rule isn't broken here.i take pleasure in one-liners as much as anyone. but not as much as i did when battle rapping was more fresh....'be thousand' is a welcome diversion from redundancy. so is the witty 'i didn't mean to' where cas waxes about being with his friend's girl.the james todd smith sample on 'you flunked' made me smile. 'givin you all a big F' from walking with a panther...del the funkee homosapien is a better rep of casual's crew, the hieroglyphics...check del out."
4,Cramer Blister Foam,"This product is excellent for blister management. Can be used after a blister has developed or to prevent one from forming. The only thing that I would like to see offered is a bulk discount. These are expensive, especiallly in my case where my children use them daily during soccer season. If they could be offered by the case at a discount I would appreciate it. I have found other sites that sell this exact item for less and have considered pruchasing them elsewhere to save money."
5,secrets revealed,WOW...kind of make a lot of sense after you take into consideration what Chuck says...you just can't tell a lot of folks!
1,Give Me A Break,Stop the madness. You're all sleep walking. When are you going to wake up from your religious delusions?
2,Bait and switch,"I thought this would be an objective, unbiased analysis of the UFO phenomenon. And for the first third of the book it is. Then Missler and Eastman veer off into a lengthy debunking of ""New Age"" ET channeling hokum, and from there into some weird christian and biblically textured version of the UFO phenomenon that I simply could not follow.What I didn't know when I started reading this book is that Chuck Missler is a messianic evangelical who infamously, and insipidly, tried to debunk Evolution using a jar of peanut butter. So, I suppose if you like angels and demons and Jesus with your UFOs then this is your book. If not, stay away."
5,Excellent Value,"Tried a set my son bought. Had to have them. Lightweight, comfortable, outstanding sound reproduction fold up compactly for transport or storage."
4,Koss knows quality,"I have been buying a pair of headphones each year and want to stop that trend by purchasing higher quailty headsets. This one by Koss didn't break the bank and sounds great. It's lightweight and delivers impressive quality sound. Over a year ago I bought a better Koss set and that one remains like new dispite teenage use (a good test indeed). This one has a smart head-like guard band to prevent tangled hair from the head bridge. I would like to have given it a five star rating, however, its cord is thin. That weakness eventually results in short-outs.My next headphone purchase will again from Koss; they deliver."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought these headphones as a gift for my husband after reading all the great reviews. They seemed like a great deal, and I hoped he could use them for an upcoming overseas trip. We were very disappointed when we received them. Although they're advertised as having ""maximum isolation,"" we could easily hear ambient noises while wearing them; there was no obvious noise reduction. In addition, a person sitting next to the listener could hear noise from the headphones even when the music source was at medium volume, which would make them inappropriate (or at least inconsiderate) for a long plane trip.On the plus side, the sound quality seemed good and the ear pads were comfortable. They'd probably be good for watching a movie or playing video games at home in a quiet environment, but not at all suited for travel."
2,Not worth the money,"I agree with another reviewer who commented that the treble is muddy-sounding. In fact, other than the over-emphasized bass, the overall sound is fairly muddy. As far as Koss' famous ""lifetime warranty"" is concerned, I obtained these through that program - when I sent in a pair of studio professional headphones which needed only foam earcushion replacement - and received back these [less expensive] portable-stereo headphones. When I contacted customer service, I was told they had already thrown away the ones I sent and had decided these were a fair substitution - if one ignores small issues like twice as high distortion, shorter cord, less expensive, etc. For their warranty service alone I wouldn't recommend a Koss product; however, their A250 ... is actually well-regarded by some professional reviewers."
2,Cord is too short! Only 3 feet.,"I have always used Koss headphones, and this one was a mistake. The sound quality is 'OK' --no better or worse that most low-end headphones (i expected more, due to the specs, which is why i bought these). They are very comfortable, and very nice to look at, and have more than enough bass. However the cord is less that 3 feet long, which doesn't even allow me to lean back in my chair at me desk (i plug it into my desk speakers). One other thing i noted, is with very high volumes the sound takes on too much midrange (makes it sound like it's coming out of a cone)."
4,Good Low-Cost Headphones,"I'm very hard on my electronics, and for years my headphones would only last a few weeks or months. I started getting the UR40 because they looked comfy (they are) and was impressed by how long they survived my ""headphones curse."" I think I've gotten maybe four pairs over the past three years? That's a huge record for me! In other words, they're well-built, and I keep coming back to them whenever I need a new one. The sound quality is great and so is the price. They're not $100 sound-canceling masterpieces, but if you wanted those you'd have to pay $100, so I think these are a great bargain for the low price."
4,A Visit to the Inferno,"Perhaps the part of this classic literature that has struck me the most is the imagery used to describe the inferno. Dante does not hold anything back in the description of this journey through the afterlife. While it is often suggested that the plot of this classic is lacking, the desciption of the place people can see only in nightmares is both vivid and disturbing. At times, the reader can almost feel the same cold feelings as Dante in this cold, dark place.While this book is hardly as casual read for the average person, the imagery description make this a ""must read' for fans of great literature."
2,"The Inferno is hot, the translation is not","I was very excited to recieve this edition of Dante's ""Inferno"", since it had such good reviews, but was very disappointed in the translation. The translation does not reflect Dante's personal writing style (it does not show his artistic or poetic style. The translation is also extremely difficult to follow and understand, I found myself re-reading the same pages over and over again in order to understand the gist of what was being said and what was happening. I became extremely uninterested in tyring to finish reading this until I found a different translation."
4,Better than expected,I was worried about my purchase but overall I have no regrets. I had a professional put it together for me during my home theater setup so I am not sure if it would have been easy for me (being quite handy). We have been enjoying lot of movies on this screen and have had it for about 1.5years now it has been doing well so far.
3,An odd mix!,"There is much to enjoy and equally much to wonder at in this work. It's worth a look if, as I am, you are a fan of Jane Urquhart's work."
3,Very good - but a mess at the same time,"Abandoned by its own director, and notorious for its graphic violence and sex scenes,'Caligula', occupies a major place in film history - but rarely does it seem to get judged fairly.. As an historical account of Gaius Caligula it is perhaps fitting - such an outragous figure deserves this sort of treatment. There is so much that goes to waste in the movie though - great actors, elaborate set designs, not a bad script..the reason it goes to waste is the weakness of focus in the movie - it seems that the camera is always in the wrong place, the greatest monologues of the film are routinely overshadowed by the other things that are going on in the frame. The colors and image are just not the right sharpness for such a grand epic. The entire film has a disjointed feel..like they can't decide what direction to take.. maybe the director abandoned the project too soon to save this film that had so much potential."
3,Too morbid.,I am not really sure of the details of this movie really happened in real life in Rome. Some scenes are too overacted and overblown.
3,hard to see...,curiosity piece -- a film made by Penthouse publisher. Story violent and hard to see on small screen.but it is interesting to watch. is it collectible?
2,Caligula,"Great actors, but this film is pornography - shocking trash!!!!! It could have been a great movie about one of the truly insane rulers of all time. One has to wonder why these great actors chose to be in this picture!!"
4,it's what i orderd,The movie got here right on time. And was in mint shape. Could not ask for more. It was a plesure ordering from this person. Thank You
4,"Naked women, BJ's, hardcore lesbos, and gore","See the title of this review to see what this movie is all about. Nuff said. If this is what you're looking for, then don't bother to read the other reviews. By the way, don't get the R-rated version of this film; you'll just be wasting your time and seeing a bad movie. Get the Unrated version. Nuff said."
5,POWERFUL MOVIE,I LOVE THIS MOVIE STORY WAS GOOD CIMEATORGHY VERY WELL DONE RODDY MCDOWELL CAST AS TYRANT DID A MOVING PERFORMANCE AS(LITTLE BOOTS).
1,"Filth, Porn, totally disgusting movie","This is possibly the most disgusting pornographic movie ever made, which tries to get people interested in ancient Roman history to buy it. It is nothing but graphic hedonistic porn from start to finish. It's a slick way for the porn industry to spread their filth where it otherwise would not be able to. If you are a Christian, stay very far from this movie. It will sicken you as it did me.I bought it only because Peter O'toole is in it. I cannot for the life of me imagine why Peter O'toole agreed to be in this filthy movie.I have marked on this movie case: smut, porn, filth; not worth watching."
1,Are You Serious??,"If this picture was not so horrible it might actually be sort of entertaining as a comedy. Production values, editing, storyline could hardly be worse. The humor begins at the opening credits ... Bob Guccione! ... and Gore Vidal! Do you really need more? It just goes downhill from there. I suppose they managed a few decent name actors of the period due to the subject matter, Guccione's involvement and the overall low tone of the times. Who could possibly spend the time writing paragraphs and paragraphs about this thing? Well, perhaps if one is an aficionado of giant plastic peni there might be some interest in this picture. Its bad enough you just wasted all that time watching it. Can't recommend this one at all."
2,A disappointment,I remember the publicity around this fild at its original release. I expected an epic production. It was a disappointment. Viewing once was enough - maybe too much.
2,Unable to play on US DVD PLAYER,"I was looking forward to viewing this movie which I hadn't seen available since the early 80's. None of my 3 DVD Players (Sony, Yamaha and Panasonic) would play the movie. I then looked at the box and noticed that the movie was for Zone 2 which is Japan and Europe. I don't understand how this shipment could have occurred."
1,Please read this,"I bought this ""Imperial Edition"" of Caligula to satisfy my curiosity. Sets: Good. Lighting: Moderately good. Direction: Adequate. Screenplay: Poor. Acting: Good.Personally I found this entire production to be profoundly depressing and a waste of time to view. Also a waste of money.I have also learned through experience that the majority of films Malcolm McDowell chooses as to appear in are/were awful, with the notable exceptions of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""O, Lucky Man."" He even admits this in his interviews. Be warned."
5,Three discs - Not four!,"If you go to the Image entertainment web site, and look at the actual box art of the Imperial edition (very top of box) you will see that this is definetly coming out as a three disc edition - apparently the fourth disc was to be a complete soundtrack of the film but got pulled due to legal reasons.Lets hope that amazon take this into account and reduce the price of the box set accordingly.Great film by the way - hope this really is the 210 version as it can finally set the record straight as to all the rumours of what was cut out.Would be nice if the long version was also cleaned up and doesn't come out later on remastered as another cash in scheme for the dvd releasing company."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a little more sex, a little less history. It's pretty slow-moving and somewhat lengthy. I still watch it, but only for certains scenes. But for what it was in the year of it's release, I'm sure it was amazing. By today's standards, it's a little too long with not enough action to hold one's interest through the whole thing."
3,Nothing else like this,"It is the most expensive porn movie ever. The actual drama gets a bit overshadowed... Still, great performances by McDowell and Mirren. But the porn thing... Most of it is not very tasteful, especially when it mixes with horrible violence. That's something for the stomach. But there are funny bits too, in the more morbid area of humour. I don't find this big drama / porn / violence mix-up very successful, but -in small portions- it's somewhat entertaining... There's no other film like this, and basically I don't think we need that either. Warning! It's a bad date movie..."
1,Awful,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, even the nudity, etc. could not hold my attention. Waste of money."
1,It Stunk,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't.Waste of money.
2,D movie,I just didnt understand this movie. It was justdownright strange and bizarre. It just did notmake sense. Was a waste of time!
1,Caligula,"This movie, no, porno, was absolutely horrible: poorly acted and terribly written. I only wish I could get my money back"
5,Why so many different ones?,"Why are there so many different caligula DVD case covers? One is blue, one is red, one is white and the 3 disc version has malcom mcdowell's eyes on the front. I don't get it."
3,movies,"Rec'vd movie in good condition, since the movie is an older film. I enjoy doing buisness with the Amazon, their the best."
1,Save your Money,"What a waste of money!!! 2-1/2 hours of some perverted guy's wet dream from the 70's. Bad acting, crappy sets, terrible dialogue, awful music. Even Peter O'Toole was bad. Besides all that, it was not even close to historically accurate, and the costumes were just bizarre.Two thumbs down...let it die."
1,Hasn't Aged Well,I had semi happy memories of this film when it first came out. At the time (a long time ago)I found it campy and sensual in an odd sort of way that helped carry the total ineptness of the film and every thing about it. I'm afraid it hasn't aged well. Today its just tacky and unpleasant. It is shockingly bad.
1,"Good movie, Horrible DVD",Could have been a great movie if they had gotten a decent director and had not butchered Vidale's script but still pretty good none the less. Shows ancient Rome in all its glory. Probably one of the most realistic potrayals of ancient Rome ever made. The film attains good status based only on the great performances by its principal actors. Now on to the DVD. I bought a copy of this horrible ... only because the cover said Digitally Remastered and Fully Restored. The film quality of this DVD is unbelievably bad. The whole thing is very grainy and there were even parts were I could see scratches in the film and also where it had been repaired. I have movies on VHS tape that put this DVD to shame. I can't say enough about how bad the picture and sound quality of this DVD is. Do not buy a copy of this .... Hopefully someday someone will really fully restore and remaster this film but this one aint it.
3,In retrospect I would not have bought this,"Some good performances, potentially interesting characters... but horribly horribly mangled.It's a series of grotesque/macabre sequences that illustrate what might have happened when absolute power corrupted a dominatrix wannabe... It has a Lord of the Flies and an Idiocracy vibe to it with the way civilization is forgotten and stupid/arbitrary logic rules but I'm making it sound much better than it is. Some of the creators obviously got into celebrating and glorifying absurd carnage and the abuse of power a bit too much and they forgot about the characters and any sort of story along the way."
4,Still an interesting watch ...,"We saw this movie when it first was broadcast on HBO a long, long, long time ago ... had to watch it twice to make sure what we were seeing was actually what we were seeing. Then had to watch it a third time to make sure.This is NOT a movie for children to watch! Even if ""Caligula"" was called ""Little Boots"" in ancient Rome, THIS IS NOT A film for the kiddies. Actually, I'm not sure my Grandmother is old enough to watch this! But I am ...Malcolm McDowell portrays Caligula as a lot of history implies - sadistic, degenerate and totally amoral. Reminds me a bit of his role in Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", but not quite as unnerving.Obviously, we cannot attest to the historical accuracy of the content, but it is an interesting film.If you have the chance, watch it for yourself. You'll agree."
3,Mediocre spaghetti-wester...I mean historical drama,"The plot relies on genre convention and the understanding that Cesar's go mad with power. That's basically it. For the sheer amount of nudity and death in this film, there are virtually zero sexually enticing scenes, or closeups of blood being drawn. There is no intercourse even close to being depicted in this film. It's so bizarre. Lots of gaudy unrealistic sets though.You might think I didn't like the film, but it was actually thought provoking. Trying to figure out the mind of Caligula (acted by A Clockwork Orange's Malcolm McDowell) was fun. He made this movie interesting for me. Seeing a young Helen Mirren was actually kind of terrifying... sorry Helen."
4,Calgula,"After years of hearing about this film, I finally obtained a copy of it and found it to be every bit as wild and controversial as I'd always heard. Interesting that there were never any other films of this type, that being a production that included top rated actors & actresses, high dollar production values and an intriguing story line too boot. Aside from the low quality of the cinematograpy, I was pleased with this purchase. It definitely was a memorable film to watch."
1,some stars pretended to be going somewhere else,"I read an interview with one of the principals (O'Toole?) in which he said he ran into Gielgud on the plane on the way to filming this miasma and that both he and Gielgud pretended to be on their way somewhere else, neither realizing that the other had been bribed into appearing in this sad yet expensive waste material.Funny thing is that I think I saw it when it first appeared, imagining incorrectly that it might be more erotic than bleak. Afterward, I pretended I had seen a different film. Closest I'll ever get to being like O'Toole or Gielgud.I only visited this site because I was curious about a Roger Ebert quote that linked to it. I wondered what Ebert would identify as a depressing film he couldn't sit through. I assumed it would be a current film, but I think it's still worth warning people about this discouraging garbage."
2,Overrated,"I thought the ""gory"" violence was pretty tame (just watch ""Hellraiser"" to see REAL violence). And I think a lot of these sex scenes were merely put in for shock value. (See Playboy's film production of Shakespeare's Macbeth for a tasteful use of sex.) Was this film dubbed? I HATE DUBBED FILMS! McDowell is great, but I thought his dance scene looked silly. I loved Gielgud, and O'Toole's character was really creepy!"
2,Hang the Editor,"I previously watched Calligula back in the 80's and was so impressed and moved with the movie, I wanted to see it again. Unfortunately, I purchased the DVD from Amazon.com believing it to be UNRATED but found it to be rated PG. Nothing like I remember. Even the scenes I remembered were removed. Refund Please."
3,Caligula the real Rome.,"This is an interesting movie in it's XXX Rated. It has to be to show the depravity of Rome in general and Caligula specificaly. The history channel doesn't do the depravity justice. This movie is very graphic, with sex, S&M, and torture etc. If your not ready for really sick stuff....don't watch this movie."
3,WHAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT?,"Okay, so this movie has Helen Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Malcom MacDowell...but were you expecting a classic screen version of Gore Vidal's literate account of the corrupting influence of power, performed by the brillance of English theatre talent. Are you on drugs?! Penthouse Magazine is the producer of this thing. In any case, apart from the porno scene additions, this movie does have legs, if you can commit yourself to believing that it's somewhat Fellini-esque in its portrayal of Imperial Rome. The performances are, uniformly, well-done by all the principles (At least by those who took the whole thing seriously.) and the art direction is impressive. And this is the unrated version, so go crazy! As for the much talked about lesbian scene, well, it has been better done elsewhere. (Not that I would know anything about that.)"
1,The mineralogy section is a disaster. An error rate of 80%!,"I am a mineralogist and bought this book for my wife as an office copy. Upon checking it out I found, to my horror, that the mineral entries are essentially worthless. There are an appalling number of omissions and errors. I cannot express too strongly how disastrous this portion of the book is. I have not done a similar check on the geology terms, but there is every reason to believe they are just as bad as the rest."
4,Buy this book!,"The new edition is much better than the previous edition. It includes XML and eliminates earlier errors. It is a great book for people who had the first Java course, Core Java2, Volume 1 by the same authors.I have trained Advanced Java to 100+ people in 4 organizations in the NYC area since 1997. This book provides the basis for the learning. The coverage on advanced Server, JSP, Corba and Jini is missing. The reader can follow up with avanced server such as BEA WebLogic 6.1 or IBM WebSphere if they have them installed at their firms. For the reader that wished to get everything FREE, download the Tomcat server or Apache server, then implement JSP. It will be a great project."
1,"Great film, poor DVD","Pasolini's ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" is one of the great Italian director's most accessable films. It is also one of the few films about the life of Christ that looks and feels as if it was filmed during the time that Christ lived - this is no Hollywood production - this feels like the real thing (the one star is not for this 5 star film.)However I want to warn potential purchasers that this Water Bearer version is a high priced non-anamorphic, poor quality print (although it claims to be digitally remastered), it has burned in subtitles with no chapter stops. I had thought DVD production and quality had improved greatly in the last couple of years, this is an unfortunate (1 star) exception. If you want to see another great Pasolini film with a great anamorphic almost pristine transfer I would direct you to MGM's version of his ""The Decameron""."
2,"Less than expected, but beautifully done",A so-so rendition of the gospel that seems to assume that the viewer already is well familiar with the story.
4,A great album for anyone who loves X-rated funk.,"On this album, Too $hort continues to play his 'pimp' character, in great doses. This album is definitely not for the more sensitive viewers, due to his extremely sexist views, but if it doesn't offend you, you'll love it. This album, as are all of $hort's, is heavily influenced by P-Funk, and there are many great samples on it. The best song is definitely ""I'm a Player"", on which he tells the lifestyle of mackin' over a dope funk beat. This is actually one of the best Short Dog songs you will ever hear, and it is worth buying just for the one song. Of course, all the songs are good though, including the remake of B.J.B., which is probably better than the original. This is also the first album, with $hort's Dangerous Crew partners rapping on many of the songs. Definitely go buy this. If you don't, then you need to ""Get In Where You Fit In, Biiiiiitch""!"
5,If you want a short dog album.. this is prob his best CD!,"You've got to have this, how could anyone not like it...unless you dont like sexual lyrics. Its somethin funky fresh that you can ride to fool! It blew me away if you like funk, pimp rap, smooth grooves, etc then buy this. I'll roll around all day in my impala on dubs to these syrupy beats (produced by Ant Banks!) and FUNNY lyrics... wishin i had an old school rag top cadillac on spokes and vogues too. His album Cocktails must ESPECIALLY be checked out also, but I stronly believe all his old school albums should be in your collection. Not sure about his newer 2001+ albums(theyre probably awesome too, but more of a lil jon, hyphy oakland style since he moved to ATL), but i just ordered ""too shorts greatest hits 1983-1988 the player years"", which has his first three albums that you wont be able to find, all on it on two discs from amazon, cant wait to get them but that stuff is OLD old school."
3,classic,"its ok to have one of this products. It was my first watches box and my watches looked very nice when i lined them up here. Though the box was a little heavy, it was still very cool and classy."
1,What? $110??,"Seriously, is the price a typo? My 2 year old Loves Blues Clues, but 110 bucks for a Notebook??"
1,Not sure what happened here,"I purchased a few of these a few months ago in the 10' length which worked great and were priced very competitively. The seller was Cables Unlimited when I selected the item both times but shows as Discount Cable Store on my order summery.The 15' lengths arrived from MarginMart and the video and audio lines on each were not isolated which created a ground loop hum in the audio line when both are plugged in. Cables Unlimited was the seller that showed up when I ordered both lengths, but unfortunately when they arrived it turned out that they are a different product from different sellers."
1,Cable didn't work,I was unable to achieve hi-res video. I put a continuity tester on the cable and found four dead pins. They refunded the purchase price but I'm out the shipping costs. Why not just send me a good cable at no additional cost?
2,The Cable is of Bad Quality,The cable is of bad quality and doesn't look nice. The Audio cables are not working at all. It is just a waste of money.
5,It just works!,"I was concerned that the combination of the audio and video, especially with how cheap it was to buy, that there would be interference or low quality, but it was excellent!It came in good time, and it worked great! The video quality was great and the knobs on the ends were long enough, unlike many other VGA cables out there.Overall, I'm very satisfied."
3,Decent unless you're watching video,When watching video this cable makes black lines go down your screen. Generally you get what you pay for
4,My 15 Favorites,"I bought this CD for the songs ""Darned If I Don't (Danged If I Do)"" and ""All Over But The Shoutin'"". After I listened to the whole CD I realized I liked everyone of them. This is definitely Shenandoah at their best."
1,Warning: these are not original recordings!,"If you are a Shenandoah fan, do NOT buy this CD unless you already have some of these songs on another CD. Many of the songs are NOT the original recordings and have very poor sound quality. I was absolutely shocked to hear these far inferior recordings that do not match the songs I know from the radio. A couple are originals (it's apparently a bit hard to re-record the duet with Allison Krauss) and sound fine. The songs are so good it's a shame to not get the originals. The best I can figure from the liner notes is that these songs were taken from a re-recording session for the album ""Now and Then."" But NOwhere on the CD does it even remotely clearly indicate you're getting something different. I had hoped to use ""Next to You, Next to Me"" at my wedding reception, but now we'll have to donwload it from itunes. What a waste of money!"
3,A great way to get that Kevlar canoe you can't afford.,"I bought this book and used it to build an ultralight solo Kevlar canoe that I'm very happy with. It is not a complete, step-by-step guide; however -- you will have to use your ingenuity from time to time and read between the lines. I definitely recommend it if you want to build with Kevlar; indeed, it's the only book of its kind. But you should read it three times before you start building, and discuss its method with your resin/fabric supplier, who may give you valuable supplemental information. And, ideally, talk to someone who has already built a canoe using these methods. But the method which the author has developed is straightforward, and you don't need a fancy workspace to build your boat. I built mine outdoors, in the back yard, in a few weekends."
5,New case,"Needed a new smaller case and I absolutely love this new case, it looks sleek and stylish and fits perfectly in my little crossbody purse. Shipped when said and arrived before I knew it. Highly recommend!!"
1,Barely useful,"Because my parents were not falling-down drunks, did not pass out before I came home from school or abuse me in the usual dramatic and overt ways, it was many years before I saw that the lack of complex, deep and interested parenting contributed to my aimlessness and confusion. Ackerman focuses on individuals whose childhoods were mainly marked by, I guess you'd call it, SEVERE alcoholism.Nor is this book is well written, the information could probably be better presented as the charts and graphs he wants to interpret. But it's still not very useful information.I just can't get into the perennial victim space; maybe that's why it falls short for me. On the other hand, I absolutely display the evidence of an ""adult child..."": I have no children (and no desire); finally made a late in life marriage that is failing now, attraction to all the wrong sorts and an ingrained tendency to want to please everyone all the time.Interesting bits in the book, but too much heavy mining for me."
3,Buy it for Db waltz,"With the slow death of WR in the early to mid 80's I stopped buying their lps. I was listening to jazz radio one night and turned it on half way through Db Waltz. I have loved this tune ever since. Hakim gets a groove going on this tune that's awesome! This tune was a return to what made WR great. A good groove and great soloing from Shorter. A nice change from the previous few techno synth albums which ""shorted"" shorter. The rest of album has its good moments as well. If you are a Omar Hakim fan get this one and Procession and invite some friends over to dance. (sure they willl find you strange but what the hell)"
1,DEFECTIVE,"I own a hardback version of this book dating from 1987 so not the same one as reviwed above. My version is full of misprints and poor English, due, I suppose, to poor editing. This makes the book difficult to read and I sometimes find the information incoherent. The subject is wonderful and I wonder if a similar version exists..."
2,Vangelis is the greatest composer of the 20th century,"Vangelis is the greatest composer of the 20th century, but Beauborg is one of his LEAST ACCESSIBLE albums - if you're looking for typical Vangelesian romantic melodies, lush orchestration, and/or amazing special effects, choose a different album. If Beethoven and/or Mozart were alive today, they would often be found kneeling before the altar in a shrine they had erected in Vangelis' honour. Vangelis' music transcends the barriers of time and space, it is cosmic and universal - His music is immediately spiritual without being dogmatic in any way. It evokes profoundly elemental visual imagery and allows the listener to access ancient primeval, chthonic memory sources."
5,A Better Option for Bow Storage and Transport,"This case is a much better option than the old standards. With all the storage options, tackle box, and quality built in, I'm looking forward to many seasons of bowhunting with this baby."
2,PLANO BOW MAX XT,"Great product. This will protect your bow with no issues, the only problem with this product is that it is so big! This thing is giant! Great to put in the back of a pick-up or SUV but wy wife has a Camery and I had trouble getting this in and out of the trunk. If size is not an issue for you, great buy.**Updated 11-30-12**I dropped the review from 4 stars to 2. I think this case is just too big. It doesn't fit well in a trunk unless it's empty. I think someone would be better off looking at a smaller case than buying this large thing. It is a pain to carry around and only fits in the bed of my truck."
4,"Very nice, functional case.","Great case for my PSE lefty bow. The box and compartments hold a lot of accessories. Good options for placement of tie down Velcro straps. Very bulky case, but does the job very well. Good storage case if you have the space."
3,"Not bad, not great","This bow case will do for now, but knowing what I know now I would have bought one of the more expensive cases. The case takes some effort to close, but it serves its purpose."
4,Decent case but...,"For the money, this is a good case that will protect your bow. The advertising said it would fit a Mathews EZ7. Although my EZ7 fits, there is not room for the convenient storage case that comes with it. The limbs of the bow are in the way. So I will mount another storage compartment somewhere."
4,great for the money,It does the job I have a MR7 Monster and it fits just fine (it fill the case but fits )The little plastic case that comes with it in the picture looks like it is devided IT IS NOT and can not be but is great for things like your release I went on ebay and found one the right size that can be devided for the other side for about $7.00 shipped to my door.(there a odd ball size that our walmart does not carry)As far as the bow case it is thinner plastic as well but with the pillar locks it is ok and protictive (I would not stand on it or jump on it or any thing like that its not that strong ) but for a case to take with you in the back of your truck to hunting camp or to a archery shoot or something like that this case is just fine.So over all Good case can not give it 5 stars just because it is what it is a nice case for under $50.00 that just does the job
2,flimsy case,Doesnt fit my Mathews Z7 bow with quiver attached. Had to remove the accessories kit to fit my bow in the case. Doubt it would stand up to a truck on it like advertised. Very poorly made. Not any larger than other hard cases.
3,"Disillusioned, my hero dethroned","I've always admired the person (Bill Clinton) that I had seen on television. He always seemed to handsome, intelligent, purposeful, caring and kind. This book destroys that image. I'm a former Bush hater."
1,from the TOE LICKER himself!!!,Absolute drivel from the pitiful Judas character that enjoys spending money on prostitutes just to lick their toes. This guy has as much credibility as the turd that my neighbors dog left on my lawn.
5,skip coffee geek and buy this steam machine,"I agree entirely with the ""wonderful value"" and ""excellent value"" reviews. I have spent 40 years in search of a perfect coffee machine, going from USD5 to USD1000 (superautomatic). I have tried every method of making coffee I know of. Early on I used an electric moka pot like this, but more primitive. Had lots of problems with steaming and moved on. Recently, my wife suggested it could have been my fault (especially since I now know I prefer moka to espresso), so I bought this. Sure enough, I now know how to make coffee with it. Tips: for cappuccino, use 200 ml (3 ""cups"") of water and stop after coffee hits 2 ""cups"" then steam milk; use espresso grind and tamp it down pretty well; pour out the residual hot water after you are done and have relieved the pressure; always start with cold machine; always brew 2 ""cups"" (not 1 or 4); use good organic milk and coffee. Bon appetit."
3,Mr. Coffee espresso machine,"This espresso machine can barely be called an espresso machine. This machine is steam driven rather then pump driven, which for those who don't know isn't very good. Because it is steam driven it doesn't create a constant espresso every time and makes it taste more bitter. Pump machines like gaggia or la pavoni often work alot better. But for someone who's looking for a cheaper buy, then paying $500 and up for a pump machine this machine isn't the worst. It is comparable to other machines in $100-$200 range. One thing that I especially don't like about it is having to use the glass container to get the espresso into rather then it pournig into small espresso cups. Another thing is that it doesn't create a good creme. Overall for some one starting out it isn't bad to train on but wouldn't be worth keeping more then a couple months."
4,Shake Hands For Ever (Wexforf),"A good yarn with the result not entirely clear until the end. Typically well written, high quality Ruth Rendell mystery"
1,Did not Like this book!!!,I cant read this book and would like to get my money back....Might use it as a white elephant present during the Christmas holiday.
1,Save Your Money,"I read books quite often. In fact, I am also the president of a bookclub and love to support African American writers. In my entire reading experience, there has never been a book that I was unable to read until this book. I tried over and over again to read this book. I even went back and reread customer reviews. I would like to offer another perspective on this book. First this book is a waste of money. It has no content nor story. You are merely reading a journal, not a good one at that. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone. This book was the book of the month for my bookclub. Not one member was able to get past page 15. In my opinion, this is one book in which I was TOTALLY disappointed."
2,did not like these,"If you ride a standard (I'm on an SV650), and want that race bike feel, go for the drag bars, not these. They are the same price and offer a better riding position that is more like a race bike. If you insist on the clubmans, you'll also need to get handlebar risers that give you a 1""-2"" rise and a 1""-2"" back-offset. Otherwise these bars place your weight way too far forward and you're going to be off balance for high speed turns(you'll end up putting all of your wight on the front tire, which only adds to its wear and makes the back end drift too much at high speed).Also of note... if you ride your bike more than 30 mins a day with these, you better be about 20 years old or they'll tear up your back something fierce. Go for the drag bars or buy the superbike bars and install them upside down. I have tried most of the variants of bikemaster bars, and these (clubmans) are by far the worst for my application (""spirited"" weekend rides and track days)."
3,Not for me,"I know the Heisig method of associating the kanji with mental pictures works for some people. But it never worked for me. In my case, the way to go was just to write them out over and over and over, and learn it by rote. Your results may vary."
1,Not what shown!,Received a squeeze tube and was expecting spray. Cotz is an excellent product but I already had a squeeze tube.
1,"Brilliant movie, brilliant performances, out of synch sound!","I have waited forever for the release of this magnificent movie. Amazing performances by Bergman, Brynner, Hayes (incredible) and Hunt. Unfortunately, there was a glitch in the brand new, out of the box DVD AND, the sound in the middle of the film was out of synch. How Fox could have let this go is a total mystery to me. I am very upset about it considering the amount of money that must have gone into the restoration. DVDs' are becoming worse all the time with quality slipping down the drain. Worth seeing and seeing again if Fox could fix their problems. Unfortunately I must return it."
2,Anastasia,The sound quality is terrible; loud one minute and barely audible the next. This should be addressed before any more copies are sold as it destroys the experience of watching an otherwise excellent film.
5,ANASTASIA-The only review,"Anastasia is the heart warming tale of Anastasia Nicholaievna, Daughter of Tzar Nicholas II, The last Tzar Of Russia. Though not Historicaly correct, Anastasia shows the pains and tormoils that 'Anna Anderson' wen't to to prove herself the last surviving member of the Romanov Imperial Family. A tear jerking Performance By Bergman keeps this compelling drama alive, and although the is she/isn't she question is never answered, it doesnt effect the plot at all. I would Also recomend 'Anastasia-The Mystery of Anna' with Amy Irving-A Historicaly correct Mini-series. Watch this film, and you will spiral into the wonderfuly surreal world that is 'ANASTASIA' a Classic!"
5,Best deal on the internet,"I have been purchasing these Depends from Amazon.com for my mother over a year now, and am very, very pleased with all aspects of the ordering process, arrival time, quality and quantity of this product. My invalid mother lives 145 miles away from me, but being able to order these Depends and having them shipped right to her front door is wonderful. I searched for the best deal on these Depends, in stores and on-line, and this is ""as good as it gets""."
5,Must Own Volume,"My poetry professor gave me this book. She buys it whenever she sees it as it is a book everyone who likes poetry should read. I was polite and took it not knowing how right she is. The gentalness with which these poems steal you is quite imppressive. I didn't realize that I had been taken captive until it was it was too late and that I think is the best kind of poem. Too strong and the reader feels trapped, too weak and why both reading, but just right and you've got a winner. This whole book is full of winners."
5,"Yay! Fun, Fun, Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",This is a very fun toy because you can wheel your doll around. use the syringe to inject medicine into her! I also bought the Baby Born feeding set with this toy because Baby Born needed a present for her sickness. I like to wheel the hospital bed around. My Baby Born doll plays around with her teddy in the hospital bed!
3,"Solidly built, except for the most crucial area!","I use this product in my job as a musician. The thing is very solid, and with the back rest (which I can't believe they make you buy separately!) it is fairly comfortable. The problem is that the actual seat is made of very cheapo thin wood.There is a hard metal plate underneath, but the wood extends a few inches on both sides, and after using for a few months, the wood will snap on both sides. If the metal plate was larger, or the wood more robust, this item would get 5 stars. I'm currently searching for a 'furniture' re-upholsterer store that can repair mine!"
4,"Sheherezade, a review",I really like this performance. I have never heard of Suhaila before this. This was lovely to watch. The storyline that was given was kind of unclear in the choreography but it was gorgeous. I wish the dance troupe was not treated as a chorus line through the whole show but the movements were interesting and difficult. Her daughter had a cute routine. The music was so great that I wish she had listed the music on the insert given. This is a keeper for a belly dance library.
5,Beautiful Music,"This is a stunningly beautiful album. It is soothing and centering with it's exquisite harmonies. I find myself singing and humming the songs when not listening to it, and it always feels uplifting.Marilyn"
4,Needs a Part II,"Excellent collection of skits that will get multiple viewings out of any SNL fanatic. A reviewer mentions that there's no ""Haunaukah Harry"" skit; don't worry, it's definitely there (""on Hershal, on Moshe, on Shlomo!!"").What's here is great, but there are so many more to include. Someone already mentioned the lack of Sweeney Sisters. There was also a great Christmas ""Mommie Dearest"" skit with Gilda Radner & Jane Curtin that I'd love to see. If I'm not mistaken, there was also an ""Uncle Roy"" themed Christmas skit. I don't believe there's any Will Farrell on here, nor are there the Christmas Greetings from Frankenstein, Tarzan and....I forget the third person.Release part II!!!"
3,disappointed with colors,I was really disappointed with the colors. I thought it would be much more vibrant. The colors in the kite did not look like the pictures.
2,Not a beginner's kite,"I will preface this, we are novices. I have not flown a kite since I was a child. Also, if the wind was a little stronger or more consistent, it MAY have been easier, but I doubt it.My daughter and I tried to fly this but never really got it up in the air. The kite took a 'nose dive' into the ground every time. We might have gotten it in the air for about 15 seconds at most. We gave up after about 30 minutes. Also, I was expecting the kite to be larger than it is."
1,Very shallow and not worth reading,"Someday an excellent biography of Laura Bush will be written, but this isn't it.Indeed, this book is a great disappointment. It is shallow and uncritical; a ""puff-piece"" that could have been written by White House operatives or the Republican National Committee, either of which might have done a better job; short and amateurish; and it contains ""filler"" material about book festivals and the like that absorbs many of its 200 pages.Having read Julia Reed's June 2001 article in Vogue just before picking up this book, I was astounded by the difference between a well-written, insightful piece of writing and this wasted effort. It is clear that the author merely parroted other writers and provided little that we didn't know already about the lovely and talented Mrs. Bush.Surely Our First Lady deserves better than this. Even ""Millie's Book"" was a better read."
1,Yawn.,"This is the second Chet Atkins album that I have, and I will not be getting another one. He's undeniably a skilled guitar player and a giant behind the mixing board, but this album is just....DULL. With few exceptions, this is an excruciatingly boring collection of songs to listen to. I was hoping for something more along the lines of Speedy West, but this is just poky and uninteresting from start to finish. The melodies are all mildly sunny, mildly sweet, mildly nostalgic, mildly....mild. It's like having to spend all day Saturday at your grandparents' house listening to their stale easy-listening C&W fare when you'd rather be outside having fun."
5,Epically lolarious.,"If you like a snappy, well-written film, this is for you. It's an example of independent filmmaking at its best. Justin Rice plays our protagonist Harmony and perfectly pins the angst and wangst of the newly single. The humor is dry and hits the spot every time. It's not fancy but it will have you rolling on the floor. Buy it, watch it, share it."
2,Not so much.,"I love many indie movies but found Harmony sophomoric and boring (at least the part I made it through). The main character was not at compelling (and nearly unwatchable) and many of the actors seemed to have a look on their face as if to say ""Look at me! I'm acting in an indie movie.""The cinematography was also completely lackluster.Of course, all of the above is exactly what's fashionable in the film festival circuit these days."
4,Great soundtrack starting with the 'B' side.,"Since I had this as a kid on casette, I was blissfully ignorant of the 'A' side of this album. As a big fan of the west coast hip hop scene, especially the Hieroglyphics guys and the Bay Area crews, the album started for me with track 10. I remember being stunned that so many of what we considered underground hip hop artists actually made it onto a fairly large production like this film. And, it seems like the album did what we all hoped it would do - expose the fans of the radio played R&B artists in the beginning of this album to the great hip hop put out by artists like Casual, Souls of Mischief, Keith Murray, Extra Prolific, etc. It's just too bad that I waited almost 20 years to write a review on this album."
5,My favorite movie of all times!,My favorite movie of all time. I cannot say why without ruining the movie for people. Lets just say that it flies in the face of certain steriotypes and common presumptions.
1,Complete waste of time,"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this flick. Having a tracker assist the police, contaminating crime scenes, interviewing witnesses would never happen. Realism went out the window there. Not to mention ""the guys who can't shoot straight"" police and FBI units.If the revenge seeking villain didn't want to live why didn't he just committ suicide and save us all from wasting our time with this movie"
2,"too wordy, too tedious","I enjoyed the first three books in the Outlander series, the fourth less. The Fiery Cross was dismil, and this one I just can't get through. There are just too many long, tedious descriptions. I am also tired of the medical descriptions. The series has lost its charm. This author needs to stop, now."
4,6 Books - Thousands of pages - questions answered and that final one asked,My sister and I have anticipated each and every book as it became available and would actually spend the money to buy the hardcover version (quite a feat for any author to produce work that the queens of second hand books will spend that kind of money on) This was definately her crowning glory. It was fairly fast paced (a rarity for some of her books)involved all the characters that you could possibly want to know what happened to and reached a suprisingly believeable ending. All in all the ends have been neatly (too neatly?) tied together and we are left with just the final question hanging.............the last page. Enjoy the book and definately do NOT skip to the end
1,"She isn't back, and she isn't Dickens","I absolutely loved the first four of this series. I have read them multiple times and gave them to many friends. Therefore I muddled patiently through the Drums of Autumn and, yes, staggered through The Fiery Cross. When I picked this one up, it was with trepidation.Perhaps somewhere in this book is a plot, but it won't be found by me. I didn't make it past page 30. I agree that Ms. Gabaldon can write a lyrical sentence, paragraph, chapter and book, but she has fallen too much in love with the words she writes. When a writer gets bogged down in every detail of every scene, the narrative flow gets lost, and the story goes with it. I am sorely disappointed. I am sad that yet another writer and her editor do not understand that selling a zillion books doesn't mean that the story needs a zillion more words. Her readers deserve more respect. And no more self-serving comparisons to Dickens. Please."
2,GRRRRRRRRRRRRRROAN!,"I loved Outlander, though there were things I did not love, like the descriptions of sadism and rape, but fair enough, I thought. If people are going to be tortured, you might as well have to put up with reading about it. But each book was less good, more full of absurd action-for-the-sake-of-action, while the whiff of deus ex machina got stronger and stronger.This book just plain made no sense--the whole thing with the stones was tedious, unbelieveable and incredibly boring! I can't stand Brianna, and Roger is a simp. I am so sick of peopel being kidnapped, raped and also of impossible coincidences. I was hoping and praying this would be the last book--but no such luck. I can't do it any more! I wish they would all get shot, stabbed and burned up in a big fire--just END it, please! At the least, I agree--EDIT! EDIT! EDIT!"
5,Bad? You've got to be kidding!,"Admittedly, Drums of Autumn was a little tedious, and the Fiery Cross made better sense the second time through. Voyager is by far the best in this series, but after reading through Drums and Cross, I have to say that with this one - She's back! Everything that made Voyager great is back in this one, from the side plots to the characterization to the humor to the unexpected turns! Human nature is unpredicable; people turning against Claire has been forshadowed for the last two books! Ms. Gabaldon wraps up some long-running questions in this one, and some of the action we have been waiting for finally happens in this one. Great job on this one, and well worth waiting for!"
4,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"Gabaldon continues to wind the Outlander saga through new territory and is heading toward revelations her readers never anticipated. I've been waiting more anxiously for the next installment than I did for the past books. So many wrenching events and upheavals need resolution. Hurry up Ms. Gabaldon, you've left our favorite little boy in a dark tunnel too long!"
5,love this serious,"And I just keep coming back for more! Very attached to the characters. Love the history, action, and adventure. The scifi/fantasy aspect of time travel and magic makes me very happy. You keep writing them and I'll keep reading!"
5,Loved it!,"Diana Gabaldons newest addition to the Clair and James Fraser saga is, (as expected),another, grab you by the throat and never let you go till the very last word novel.And as always leaves you wanting more!You follow the Fraser clan through the birth of a country, the fight for daily survival,betrayl, murder and intrigue .Through it all thier love,faith and trust of one another holds them together."
5,Now what.....?,"When my girlfriend gave me the first book of over 700 pages, I put it aside for several weeks before I picked it up....then I couldn't put it down and even before I had finished it, I literally ran to my local bookstore and purchased the next 3 books. When those were finished I bought the others as quickly as they were published. I loved them. I enjoyed her writing, the descriptions, the characters. I can't believe I will not know more about these ""friends""."
1,The bloom is off the rose,"The series should have ended before this volume. It's bloated, repetitive, boring, and self-indulgent, not a cohesive story but a collection of vignettes, often unrelated to the main characters we know and love. A sharp editor should have sliced this huge book in half."
3,Certainly Better than Fiery Cross,"I was one of those readers who had very little good to say about FC, and I admit to being concerned about the quality of this latest installment. While I am very happy that it was better than the last, it didn't seem quite up to the level of the first few books that drew me in to the series to begin with. I was unable to really get in to the reading until the last 100 pages or so, and while there were a lot of questions answered, there were even more presented. But I will still be at the store the very day that the next one comes out!"
5,Wonderful book!,This is a great book in the Outlander series. Who wouldn't want to read about the continuing adventures of Claire and Jamie? Happy reading.
2,Doesn't keep me up at night,"I confess to being in love with Jamie Fraser in the early books. In fact, I read them so many times that the pages are curled. ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes"" hasn't drawn me in like the others. I'm at page 151 and the plot alternates between Claire performing medical heroics, flashbacks to earlier story threads,tiny hints of the coming revolution, bedroom scenes, medical heroics, flashbacks, bedroom scenes. So far, six bedroom encounters in 151 pages, and I'm longing for REAL action. I'm not motivated to finish the story, but will probably keep slogging through, hoping it will pick up the pace."
5,Outlander Series,This book is wonderful and very detailed and exciting as all of the Outlander series books have been.
5,Another great addition to the series,"This book does not disappoint. It is long, but I savored every page. The descriptions of rural early America make you feel like you are there, and the characters remain true to themselves. The adventures seemed realistic, which I've found may not be exactly the case of a couple previous adventures that Jamie and Claire have had in previous books (always exciting- perhaps not totally realistic). Reading this book only made me desperate for the final one or two that are to come."
3,Still love Claire & Jamie...,"700 pages of day-to-day sordid details, short stories strung together, and a rather gratuitous rape. I was tired of the political parts regarding the American Revolution.279 pages of classic, page-turning, emotional, wonderful Gabaldon writing!I did not like the sort of silly yet insidious turn with Arch & Mrs. Bug at the end.I've read all DG's Outlander series, yet I found I could barely remember who Jocasta was, Hector, Lord Grey, why William was with him, etc. These details were lost to me. But I could sort of piece the gist of it together. I think I need to start from the beginning again. For me personally, nothing later ever came close to the first two, Outlander & Dragonfly in Amber."
1,So disappointing,"I eagerly picked up the 6th (and I thought final?) book in the Outlander series only to be woefully disappointed. I just didn't get it. The storyline was disjointed and unbelievable. As others have mentioned, seriously, how much rape, murder, and sex can we have? How many times do Jaime and Claire have to come close to death? And having come to love Jaime and Claire, I got so tired of their constant trials and problems. Can we give them just a little break? Roger and Brianna could have been a great storyline, but the author never really gave them any flesh or bones. I could never understand why they stayed, or their motivations. The end was rushed and unsatisifing. I read through 6 books and felt lost and abandoned at the end. There was no real tie up, no sense of conclusion. I was left with more questions and an unsettled feeling. Such a disappointment. I don't see how anyone could give this book a decent review."
2,WHERE are her editors???,"Her first book, Outlander, was fast-paced and full of detail without the awful, wordy, boring descriptions of every single feeling in this latest installment. Outlander was very tight and very good. My friends and I have described The Fiery Cross as an expensive doorstop, and this one isn't much better. I am betting thousands and thousands of words could be cut from this boring story and it would again be tight and a real page turner."
5,Best series ever!,"I read all seven Outlander books and loved every one! In fact, I'm still feeling a sense of loss at having finished reading them. I hope the author writes more!"
5,A Breath of Snow And Ashes,I have just finished this book and am reading An Echo in the Bone. Have read all the earlier ones and loved each one. Descriptions of settings are breathless. The characters are so well defined that I feel I know them. The stories make me want to get some gems and go looking for standing stones. Wonder if Jamie is still in the highlands of either Scotland or North Carolina.
2,Just Not My Style,"The rave reviews here on Amazon persuaded me to order this book, but it's not a keeper for me. The overall style of the sayings and the clipart are just too cute-sy and country for me. Just not my scrapbooking style. So, I got a few ideas, but overall I found this book disappointing."
1,Disappointed,I found the book to be childish. I was disappointed but my 14 year old niece was thrilled when I gave it to her.
1,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with the book. I had exspected a lot more quotes, instead it was a bunch of cuties drawings. I wish that Amazon had let me look inside the book before purchasing it."
4,scrapbooking,I spend a lot of time looking for the right journaling to top off the paper. I have this with in my reach.
3,A nice addition to a jazz collection,"I found this cd rather enjoyable. Donald Byrd demonstrates his ablilties and musical tastes teamed with the rest of the personnel on the disc and shows that he can put a unique touch to the various tunes, from the smooth ballad Beast of Burden to the driving, almost tribal feel of The Black Disciple with the voices. Consider this something pleasant to add to your collection, perhaps not a masterpiece, but something worth having."
1,Amazon sent open box item,"Amazon sent me a returned item with half the parts missing. Sanus customer support refuses to help if you purchased one of their products from Amazon because, and I quote the rep, ""Amazon does this a lot, and it really annoys us"".If it was only a small connector they would have sent me a replacement, but because half the parts were missing, I have to send it back.A proper review will be in place if the replacement actually has the parts.------UPDATE:Got the replacement items a while ago and after some use I still wouldn't buy these.The stands wobble a round a ton, the plastic ring that keeps them elevated is starting to crack, and they're considerably heavy considering their cheap build."
4,Works great for BOSE 161,"I like the construction, it has a rhino liner type coating. The instructions were terrible but not impossible. The 2 straight rods were placed inside the 2 base rods and there were very difficult to remove. Rating out of 5 putting this together, a 2! But, don't let that discourage you. It comes with many adapters for different types of speaker. I'm using Bose 161s and never thought I would find stands suitable for these speakers. Overall, I love them and was happy to avoid putting holes in the walls. I really like how the speakers look and sound using the 2 angled rods. I also like the channeling for speaker wire, although it is odd that there is a groove where it looks like you can run wire under the base but the wire comes out about 3 inches above the base. I posted some pics."
3,Misleading covers and titles,"Like most Electric Blue videos, this one has a misleading cover and title. The cover sports Traci Topps whom you don't see in the video, and the title sequence is full of bodacious babes that - guess - aren't in the video."
1,Pretty bad,"Book just doesn't seem to have anything useful in it. For what appears to be a basic book on the subject, it totally lacks any general theory of the subject."
1,Non-stick in reverse,"Others have complained about food sticking to the griddle, but that's only half the story. If you have the patience to free the bacon from the surface of the griddle, the ""non-stick"" paint stays on your food! I don't know what it's made of... teflon? Lead?A terrible product that may or may not poison your family. And it makes a horrible noise when it reaches the target temperature. Seriously one of the worst purchases I can remember making."
5,works great,The thing I like most about this griddle is it comes apart easy so you can wash it right away without the worry that water will get in the plug.
1,Almost gave me a stroke,I've never yelled at a cooking appliance before (especially in front of my children) but when I had 8 pancakes stuck to this grill with 2 hungry toddlers crying in the background for breakfast I really went nuts. I destroyed a spatula trying to scrape them off! What kind of surface does that? I seriously couldn't get them off even with water!! I CAN NOT BELIEVE RIVAL WOULD SELL SUCH A PIECE OF JUNK & I WILL NEVER BUY A RIVAL PRODUCT AGAINI asked for a grill for X-mas & someone got me this junk. I just ordered an ALL-Clad over the burner grill & will post that review.
5,Great speakers,"These speakers produce smooth highs and decent midbass, even off stock factory power. They would even better amped. Especially for the price, these are a good value."
4,Cosas Del Amor (Japanese Issue),"This Japanese edition was released in 1999. It features some tracks remixes (present on the album Remixes, 1998), plus remixes of Bailamos. Front and back cover art different from the international edition.Scarce and indicated especially for collectors and fans."
1,False Advertising - Not USA Made!!!,"I specifically chose this Elmo stuffed animal over others because the description stated ""Origin: USA"". I wanted to support local products and I trust our manufacturing laws much more then China's. Turns out the tag on the product says ""made in China"". I expect a full refund and no one else should buy this until it is labeled properly ""Origin: China"""
3,Disappointed,"Disappointed is the one word that comes to mind when I see this toy. I had previously orderedGund Sesame Street Cookie Monster 12"" Plushand that product lived up to its expectation. How a 13"" Elmo is smaller than a 12"" Cookie Monster is beyond understanding. Also the quality was poor compared to the price.As others have mentioned here, the eyes are plastic, but that doesn't seem too much of a concern at this point."
1,Hot Pink Elmo,"He is soft but he is very thin. He actually looks more hot pink than red. When he's up against our other Elmo's he looks VERY pink.Overall, I'm not very happy with this skinny pink Elmo."
2,Poor Elmo has sensitive eyes...,"The big problem with this toy is that the eyes on it are extremely fragile. Our son has dropped it on the ceramic kitchen floor a few times, and already twice I've had to repair the eyes as pieces break off."
3,Face Was Smashed,"I was hoping for better quality but for the price it was just OK. His mouth was smashed almost flat when I received it, so better packaging would have been nice."
3,Low Quality,"The back of Elmo's head split open within 2 days, leaving our toddler to start eating the stuffing that's inside. Wouldn't recommend it."
2,disappointed,"I used this product years ago and loved it. I haven't been able to find in any store since and was excited to find it on amazon. When I received it in the mail I immediately opened it up at put some on. It tasted bad, like it was VERY old. Maybe the reason I haven't been able to find it is because it is a product no longer made?? I wonder if someone who sold Neurtrogena products is getting rid of old stock. Bummer!"
4,"5 Stars for the movie, minus one for the annoying commercial","First, I'll agree with all the other posters on the quality of the story and acting. Swashbuckling, action fun in a way that simply doesn't get made anymore. If you enjoyed Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, you'll like this one too - two of the actors from Robin Hood even appear in Zorro in almost identical roles.So, now to the annoying feature that lost this particular version a star: that stupid anti-piracy ad in the beginning of the colorized version that you can't skip past. I appreciate having the option to watch either the color version or the B&W;, but if I have to sit through that 30-second torture every time I want to watch the color version, I think I'll stick to the B&W; one."
5,The Mark of Zorro - a swashbuckling experience.,"My grandchildren thought it was very exciting, It brought back such great memories.It was wonderful sharing this experience to share with them."
5,Awsome Book!,"VOLCANOES!!! This book can tell you where, how, when, and why the volcanoes erupt. Do you want to know how they are formed? Well, you can find out in this book. Apparently, right now we could be standing on something that used to be a volcano. Did you know there are different types of volcanoes? From Cinder Cones to Dome Volcanoes, this book is a great source of volcano information.I enjoyed reading this book because it has some really cool facts that I didn't know before. My favorite part was a picture of lava that was burning down a building. I loved the large number of photos that were throughout the book. I thought that the writer did a great job explaining volcanoes and I learned a lot. One thing that bothered me was that there wasn't a glossary or an index. If you are interested in volcanoes, this book is a good fit for you."
3,Not that Impressed,"I am on the phone 12-14 hours a day, mostly on a landline phone. This piece was purchased for my cell phone, and it was very uncomfortable for the ear and for listening. But how can I complain about the price, so its now sitting as a door stopper (LOL). Just my personal opinion, so please refer to other reviewers for more indepth information."
1,"hard to fit into ear, easy to break","very difficult to fit the clear rubber attachment into the ear canal.I tried to take the rubber attachment off, but the cap fall off together and broke one of 2 wires.The seller sent me the replacement and I tried again. This time I only tried to carefully rotate the rubber attachment in order to fit into ear, but slight rotation also break the cap off and break the wire.I had to return the product as I could not find a way to use it and it breaks so easily."
5,Condie,"It was an incredible biography. It was especially poignat in that my children went to St, Mary's Academy in Denver. The book was well written and clear complete and concise. It was a testiment that blacks can compete and be sucessfull if the right environment and attitude, is present."
5,I Loved this book! READ IT,"""Forbidden Legacy"" was an emotional funny book that made me think about trusting God and his will for my life, it just.. works out."
1,5 months whitening plus,"After i have used it for a week, i havent seen any noticale results. This was suppose to do a quick5 minutes whitening, but never did. That's why i give it one star."
4,good,I have sensetive teeth so it seems to work on that part . Have not used it long enough to rate the whiteng but i did use the reguar stuff. I like it better than the strips
3,This is the best work up till now,"This is the overall best effort from Walter Trout. The material hold a higher standard than other albums which are featuring mostly non-exciting but very traditional blues numbers. The material on ""Telling stories"" includes some songs that aren't the typical blue print blues, and that brings a feeling of variation. The best tracks are: ""Tremble"", ""Wanna see the morning"", and ""Somebody's crying""."
5,A truly creepy thriller!,"School's Out is a really intelligent, dark, and weirdly funny thriller. The students in Pierre Hoffman's classroom are out to get him, but he's not sure why, and the disturbing messages he keeps receiving aren't helping. I couldn't put this book down! Definitely for fans of Donna Tartt's The Secret History."
4,Not Bad for the BUCKS!,I own a local TV station where I have to depend on good audio when taping. I bought this MIC for a local car show that I produce. The audio worked out great. The range was no problem since the transmitter and receiver were not anymore than 30 -50 feet apart at anytime. Good audio for this price!
3,lots of work and lots of space,it takes about 20min to put it together. it takes a lot of space but is fun to play with for 45 min max- via my 5 yr olds experience. as a single mom the hardest part is finding time to put it together for him (along w/ the discovery). otherwise it is fun.
2,"Great Idea, but, deeply shoddy construction","I just got finished assembling this for my nephew and I'm looking at him play with it. He seems to like playing with it, but his play is interrupted with an ""oh no! Broken!"" every 4 or 5 minutes. the track pieces don't stick together well, the angled pieces barely fit in the trusses. The curved landing track from the tall descent is badly molded that it hardly functions to both turn a corner and change angle at the same time. The walls that attach to retain the engines as they curve at high speeds are questionably attached to the track. When using the walls, the track loses any sort of reversability and the curved pieces that attach to the tall tower don't stick well. It's basically barely standing up and will need constant reattachment and attention.It is a fun idea. Nephew likes taking the trains down the chutes, and the sounds are okay, but it needs a fair amount of rework before I'd recommend it for anyone."
1,not worth your money,"My kid got this for his 4 B-day and all kids just ripped the box trying to open it. Unfotunately. Because once we built it,everything just kept falling apart. My kids get upset everytime we try to built it. If we had a box, i would return it and never ever buy anything like this. Not worth your money, for sure!!!"
2,Disappointed,I bought this toy for my girls and doesn't not hold up to a 4 1/2 and 2 year old gentle girls. It is very frusterating for them to play with.
1,more time spent fixing than playing,"my son is almost 3 and loves the concept yet i spend more time putting ti back together than he does playing on it. the spiral is mostly secure but as soon as you try to go down hill, the support pieces are barely table and the tracks have so little support that the whole side collapses. he can barely use 3 trains and it's in shambles. if i could take it back i would - by far this is the most i've spent on one of these sets and would take it back in a heartbeat. i bought it when he was 2 hoping our results would be different but nwo they're worse - and i wish i never dug it out of storage to try it again. can't wait until it disappears when he's sleeping one night...."
5,1 of the best R&B groups of the 90's,"... What's that in America? Junior High? I'd heard the classics ""I like the way"" and ""Just another girlfriend"" off the first album even though it was hard to come by... My girlfriends at the time and I were always talkin', hummin' and impromptu singin' the tunes. Oh Tony! Such a cutie! It was easy enough to have a crush on him! That's the essential essence of Hi-Five's music-that crush. And those were the lyrics that said it all. If you had a crush, those would be the words you wish were played for you.Anyway, I have all the albums..., So when there was a greatest hits album with never before heard songs on it you know I had to get it. ...This is a great album for those uninitiated and who want a taste of undisputedly one of the best R&B; groups of the early 90's. Forget that boy band ...[stuff] of today, this is it! Even though I'm not a teenager anymore I still love these songs. They're classic for all time. Buy all the albums, all the songs are good!"
5,School Day's,Yeah this CD is pretty cool I'll just sit back throw this on and I can remember goin to School for that 1 girl man. These songs are classic's if you grew up in the early 90's. I was only 10yrs old when there first CD came out but I can still remeber the words . Got me remebering that Girl I had a Crush on WHEW!! What's really goin on! But If you liked them before I Highly recommend that you invest in this CD a cheap price for a Time Capsule.Yall Know what I mean. Peace!
3,Jaded: For Christians in a Wilderness,"Jaded is a helpful book for those experiencing disatisfaction with typical American church life. It is not THE answer, but it provides some answers and direction for those who are wrestling with their church relationship. Especially encouraging in reading what others are or have experienced, and it helped me in reaching a decision. The author makes numerous, relevant points regarding the net effect of corporate Church life on many believers who love God, love God's people, but have come to a place of gnawing disatisfaction and/ or spiritual letdown within their church. If you are struggling with your church relationship and you have been a Christian for several years, and you are not offended and angry with another believer or the ministry, then read the book."
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the review written by Nessa except for two things. My opinion is that two stars and the title ""Not quite there"" grant too much favor to this book. The writings in this book are disappointing and dangerously deceptive. The author generously paints true statements, good statements and Scriptures that seem to apply onto an underlying and antithetical theme.The author quotes Martin Luther, ""Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other. My conscience is captive to the Word of God.""Because ""authorities"" includes authors of books and because this book is missing plain reason and convincing Scripture, I plan to trash this book. Literally."
5,Thank you Dr. Denmark!,"This book is a must have for all new moms. When we had our first baby, we tried to do it the ""modern"" way just like our pediatrician said...feeding every 2 hours, waking her up all through the night - we were all miserable and she was still not gaining weight fast enough. By the time she was 3 weeks old, we were willing to try anything. A friend told me about Dr. Denmark so I bought this book and tried her schedule. By the 3rd day she was sleeping all night(8 hours), started gaining weight faster than she had before, and was just a happier baby. She has slept through the night eversince. She has now been sleeping 13 hours since she was 4 months old. Dr. Denmark is the longest practicing pediatrician in America, so I believe she has some pretty credible things to say and we should listen. I think that anyone who has something negative to say about Dr. Denmark or this book has not tried it with their own baby. Thank you Dr. Denmark!"
3,"Good Historically, Breastfeeding Info Poor","I read this from a historical perspective. I lived in North Georgia and attended the same Medical School school (many years later) as Dr. Denmark. I enjoy the historical perspective and most of the wisdom, however, I was really hoping the wisdom would extend to great intuitive breastfeeding information. The information about lactation (and scheduled feed recomendations) is not what works in my practice to provide support to the nursing mother.Denise Punger MD FAAFP IBCLC"
4,The beginning of my love for R&B began...,"With this cd. My first compact disc purchase when I was 14, due to the song ""Back and Forth."" I enjoyed Aaliyah's style and song interpretation, so when I bought this cd, I was amazed at her vocal talent. Taking aim at the Isley Brothers with her version ""At Your Best(You are Love)"", and completely updating it and acheiving kudos for it? At 15 years of age, not an easy task to acheive. I will forever listen to this cd, with rememberance of walking a mile to the local store to buy it, and turn me on to the wonderful world of R&B."
4,an R&B album with a soft Hip Hop feel...,"I took out her 2 cds, that I own, when I heard of her passing. So young. And due to the 2 cds that I have, along with her other non album singles, she was definitely going somewhere and had wonderful talent ahead to show. I think you'll definitely have to like R&B/very soft Hip Hop in order to appreciate the album. Also, keep in mind that she was 15 when she did this album. Some of the 'young me' favorites on the cd are (quite a few off the album); ""Age Ain't Nothing But a Number"",""Down with the Clique"" (fun beat & rhythm), ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" (R&B love song, pleasant), ""No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do"" (more of a hip hop love song...unique), ""Young Nation"", and I like the R. Kelly remix of ""Back & Forth"" (party song). All in all a pleasant album. And I would rate this a 4 even before her death. Wonderful debut album from a 15 year old, and the songs are what a 15 year old would sing and create (along with her co-creators)."
3,"Back,Back or forth and forth","With R.Kelly in the backround whatever aaliyah lacks its made up by resources in the team that surrounds here.. there are definately some good songs on here, This is just the beginning for this chicago based musician.great things are coming."
5,Even better than Cons!,Went out and got my copy (like I said in my Cons review) and finished it in two days! What great follow-up. This book moves from start to finish and the characters keep you hooked. You feel like you are along for the ride. This would make a great movie (along the lines of Pulp Fiction).
5,Engelbreit books,Lots of interesting projects in this book. I am looking forward to having time to work on some things.
3,"ANOTHER VERSION, PERCHANCE..?","This one truly is an unforgettable mishmash... really enjoyable bad film with lots of laughs in the store for the one who dares. But: this release as depicted above (red cover) is using incredibly poor source material. Amazon.com also sells another version: Navarre Corporation/Reel Values Triple Feature Horror Classics Volume 9 (wow! sounds like a British address!) features The Maniac which looks much better. It's almost as cheap, but it comes with two other flicks which are mediocre but quite watchable. Recommended!"
5,"Ed Wood, John Waters and Russ Meyers - - Envy this !","This one is a real find... I initially rented it at the video store because I love cult films, but this one is a keeper, so I am adding it to my Amazon shopping cart. - Its an orgy of overacting, bad acting, sublime spookiness and just plane goofiness that despite its short legnth goes WAY OVER THE WALL beyond any other film of the cult/horror/exploitation/camp genre ever made. This is Rocky Horror meets Plan 9... Ed Wood and John Waters outdone before their time... You will want to watch some of the scenes over and over again - - and will probably annoy your friends by laying some of the lines on them. And theres nudity too... If anyone can name a film as OUT THERE yet FUNNY as this, please tell me... my appendix will burst watching it."
1,"Be careful, don't buy fake","Guerlain Meteorites are exellent, but be careful, seller evecare.com sales not real Guerlain Meteorites, but counterfeit, moreover, it has expired use-by date."
1,Poor costumer service,I was sent damaged and poorly packed goods. Denied an exchange or refund. And am now the proud owner of a $150 paperweight. Its completely appauling that this has happened.
4,Great lens for money.,"I got the 40-150mm zoom to go with my E-520. While the depth of field is not as shallow and has less bokeh than I'd like, overall it's a very good lens. Compact, quick focusing, and very sharp. It would be nice to have a lower aperture, but that's not a realistic hope. Great bargain for the money."
2,Disappointment,"I usually like both Argerich and Dutoit, but EMI has not done either of them justice, and to me, Argerich sounds less involved than in other recordings. The real drawback, though, is the sound. Decca provided Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony with clear, open sound that made their recordings enjoyable. To me, EMI's sound here is indistinct, bordering on muddy at times. Orchestral detail is lost, and on a couple of occasions the piano just disappears behind the orchestra. I bought this recording expecting something special, but was quite disappointed."
4,Hard Cash is best,Hard Cash is one of the best college student stories ever. It really captures the reader so that it is almost imossible to put the book down. I'm sure many young adults can find themselves in the same situations as Rich (main character).This is a most read!
5,LLLOVED ITTT!!!!,"I've been an avid reader for 40 years and every now and then I become engrossed in a story and morn its ending. I was very suprised to find out that this is John Mackie's first published novel and relieved to learn that there is more to come. I guess what I'm saying is, I highly recommend Manhattan South."
3,not deep enough,"Sheets are really soft,but when i put the fitted sheet on it slips off. I have to put it back on the bed each day.other then that they are just fine"
1,Waste of money,"I'm disappointed with this book. PeopleSoft PeopleBooks and Red Papers provide better explanation. The author, for the most part, did not add any value. I wasted $20 on this book."
5,Nazimova :),"I bought this for the silent version mainly for Nazimova's performance and the music score. Perfect, i can't believe i got it so cheap... only wish and hope they remaster this classic for Blu-ray someday soon. I've never seen the Garbo version and don't care... i bought this for Nazimova alone and it's worth every penny."
4,Wow,Great follow up to the first book. (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty) Definately a page turner and keeps you interested from the first page to the last.
4,insightful,This book is insightful into submissive dominant relationships. It also seems to have rehabilitating qualities in concern to this.
1,Horrid Book,This book was awful!! Ann must think that she is writing for children. The characters are not developed and Beauty seems stupid to me. I hated it
2,The next 50 Shades of Gray? I think not.,Beauty's PunishmentVery boring and repetitive. I bought the second book by mistake so I bought the first one so I could start from the beginning but I wont be buying the last one!
1,Mortified,"I do NOT recommend this trilogy to ANYONE!!! I only read it because a friend read the description & thought I might like it. I downloaded all three books. I actually got queasy at times reading this. I'm not a prude by far, but this is just sick... I was Mortified,Grossed Out, Repulsed, Disgusted and also had nightmares. This was a huge waste of money..."
4,Loved these long before 50 Shades,The only reason this book didn't get 5 stars from me is that I wanted it to be longer! I had read them all years ago before buying them for Kindle and am still in awe of how inventive and exciting they are!
4,Beauty's Punishment,"Fairytale, sexuality in the most raw form. Unusual, but kept my attention all the way through. I'm off to get the final book of the trilogy now!"

2,Tiring - more S&M,"From its prequel's incessant paddlings from the nobles, this story starts with the village auction where the protagonists were sold & their rightful masters punish them according to will. Aside from the change in venue, nothing really changed in the plot. More spankings & whippings but no extreme brutality which would cause a person's death. That's strange! Aside from Beauty & Tristan's willful stubborness to locate a stronger master, nothing much has been dealt with on the psychological level. Seems like the entire story was moulded on Beauty's turning into a whore (pardon the word) & a nympho whilst I could not determine if Tristan is a gay.Just like its predecessor, this book is such a disappointment!"
2,Just as disappointing as the first.,"After reading the first book, I felt compelled to read the second only in hopes that Ms. Rice would develop her storyline. Although she does share the pschology behind the slave master relationship it is still a neverending spanking marathon. Book two was as dull as book one."
4,Blast from the past,"If you ever wanted to hear Ricky Martin when he first got started...here is where you should be. In addition to Robby, Ray, Sergio & Charlie. Wonder where they are? Me too. This recording from 1986, yes....this album does have the sound of the 80's. The album is full of fun loving dance music when times seemed a bit more simple. SUMMER IN THE STREETS and WE HAVE A SONG definately tell you what summer is all about. Even though the album doesn't have the hi-tech sound of the today, but it is a nice trip down memory lane."
2,not worth it...,"I bought this originally to do cabinet installation and it didnt work out as planned. It has too small of a footprint (it's too short) and gets out of level by the smallest of irregularities on any given surface. Well specifically kitchen cabinets. I ended up going home to grab my 6 foot level.Another nitpick with it is the switch. You rotate the switch to turn it on and rotate it to turn it back off. It will easily turn itself back in if jostled inside a tool bag.However our dog just loves chasing the laser beam around the house so I'll probably keep this toy, hence the two stars."
5,Golden ... for the true study of jazz from this guitar giant,"Insightful and in-depth studies. This book, studiedthroroughly, will make you a master in years to come. I'm a great fanof Joe's..."
2,misleading,"this nothing but a copy of the nova pbs program that was produced for the sole purpose og ""proving the single bullett theory"" the program also serves an injustice to the dallas dr's by taking ther opinions out of context by editing making them look like bumbling idiots. not one word was said about nova in the product offer or the liner notes on the package. shame on all of you,keep up the good work on the on-going cover-up.gitjoe45@aol.com"
5,I couldn't put this book down until finishing the last page.,"Back when this tragedy happened, I wondered how Jim Jones could have had such power over so many.This book explaines it in a way only someone who had been there could.It is a very good book about a very sad event."
4,"Compelling but very, very sad. A MUST read!","I read this book after hearing about it in an article recently, given the anniversary of the horrible events in Guyana. It's a compelling story, well-told and I truly could not put it down. I read it in 2 days.I felt so sorry for Debbie Layton, her family and all the others who were fooled into joining Jones' so-called church. I was very young when the events in Jonestown occurred, and I learned a lot of things from this book that I never knew (socialism/communism link, government complacency, etc). Before reading Layton's account, I admit I was skeptical. How could any reasonable person fall into a cult? But after reading this, I can feel the desperation of Layton when she was recruited. She was very young, vulnerable and insecure. She was the perfect target for Jones. I think that anyone with an interest in psychology, cults, religion or true-crime would thoroughly enjoy Layton's account. I hope the people who escaped Jonestown have found peace."
1,Not Good,"The phone is almost unusable. The volume, even on highest level, is too low to hear. The clock is not lit so that it can be seem with out fumbling for a small button at night."
3,Cap'n Crunch,"This tape series was helpful, but I liked the Sum & Substance series better. The Gilbert series is taped from lectures given in a class room setting. This makes them a little more dynamic than someone simply reading from a transcript, but the tape quality suffers for it. It is frustrating to pay 200 dollars for a tape and hear people coughing in the background."
3,It's cute.,"I want to say this is a cross between Father Tim from Jan Karon's Mitford series and listening to Garrison Keillor tell one of his Lake Wobegon stories, but flipping the book over I noticed Publishers Weekly already said it. So, I'll just say it's cute."
5,Life does indeed go on!,I for one love this book and Harmony is a wonderful place to escape. Full of all kinds of characters but with a message or two and lots of laughs. I think it must be difficult being a servant of the Lord and having so many people depend on you for so many things.I enjoyed this book that goes from season to season along with it's inhabitants and all their trials and triumphs.You won't want to miss out on this book. Maybe more people will read this and realize what can they do for their minister and fellow man versus what is everyone doing for them!
5,Blues done right,"Don't listen to the editorial. I'm a big SRV fan and this album is NOT at all a copy and is indeed original. Duarte's sound is obviously influenced by SRV but what blues rocker that has come along after 1990 isn't?? KWS sure is. This is an excellent, up beat album that any blues rocker will enjoy. Buy it today!!"
2,"The ""Real Deal"" turns out to be the ""Fake Deal""","This cd was a big disappointment to all true Buddy Guy fans. Anyone who has ever seen Buddy live on a great night knows that his guitar playing is so intense and raw that no guitar player today (except maybe Santana or Jimmy Page) can match him. This cd sounds overproduced and the guitar playing is kept to a minimum....and brass and horns backing Buddy..come on! Real fans owe it to themselves to track down and purchase the import cd ""Six String Frenzy"" which is the only cd to accurately capture Buddy at his crazed and frenzied guitar playing best."
4,Alan Hovhaness,"Alan Hovhaness is quite a ""comfort zone"" composer. This particular collection is very pleasent and well ballanced. I recommend it, especially since the sound is particularly good on it."
4,a good refernce book for making a car purchase decision,a good reference book for making a car purchase decision. we utilized a non-profit organization listed in this book to guide us through a safe car purchase
3,grape string lights,All products arrived on time as promised and in exactly the condition I expected. Great company to deal with.
1,Gross Out!,"I am so disapppinted in this video. It is like a home video and very poorly made. the exercises are just OK but I expected superb from the description and reviews. In a word, YUK!"
4,Excellent de-frizzer,My hair-stylist recommended this shampoo and I have used nothing else since. Absolutely great product.
2,Legendary?,"Freud would have been proud of Martha Argerich, for her playing rarely transcends raw lust, and the necessity to sublimate it in said 'virtuoso' playing...don't look for any philosophy/poetry here, for it is neither a broad world-view, nor a profound insight into the human condition...escapist, sexual nonsense. I suppose this sort of thing is necessary, but why not tune into Radio 1 for a few cheap pop songs, instead of enduring the depressing experience of Argerich demolishing Chopin's sublime 3rd sonata, or perhaps you prefer her desecration of the scherzo...it's your choice."
5,excellent,"Huss is a briliant artist. Nearly all the paintings here in are highly evocative, and just scream to be examined at length. The way he combines contemporary fantasy art with classical styles and themes is just marvelous. Check it out."
3,"OK, but...",Works as advertised. Now if I could only get airlines to provide coach seats with adaptors I'd be all set.
3,worth the trouble,"If you hate paragraph breaks this book's for you! Hardly any paragraphs and no quotation marks makes us think more deeply about who is talking ie identity. Part philosophy/part thriller, I enjoyed reading this book and loved the ending, but felt left behind a bit in the middle, and my life wasn't changed at the end like I'd hoped. I didn't think Tertuliano got as much out of it either ... shouldn't he have been more moved also? Ie in a good, life-affirming way? Maybe I was picturing a different kind of book ... this one's double? 3 1/2 stars"
3,The Doppelganger(s)?,"This was the first Saramago book I read and I really enjoyed his train-of-thought prose. I felt it fit well with the main character's indecisive nature. Unlike the slower, contemplative first, the second half of the book is like a roller coaster ride with an interesting ending. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the doppelganger theme has been done before and better. That doesn't mean this isn't smart or enjoyable (it's both), I just think your better off with Dostoevsky's 'The Double' or Dumas' 'The Man in the Iron Mask' or Nabakov's 'Despair' or 'Pale Fire'. So, despite a few flaws, I still recommend this book (especially for Saramago newbies)."
4,Replaced lousy Hyundai Sonata horn,"Have an early 2011 Sonata. As one magazine reviewer said, it seems Hyundai took the horn off every scooter in Korea & put them on the Sonata. Based on other reviews of this horn, I chose it. Arrived fast & with all the parts ( a real bonus these days ). The name Freeway Blaster had my wife worried it might sound like an 18 wheeler. But it just sounds like a decent normal horn. In fact, I'd have given it 5 stars if it had been a bit louder. But it's MUCH better than the horn that came on the Sonata."
4,Fiamm Freeway Blaster Horn,"Item worked as indicated. Installation instructions were not very good but I figured out the install. You absolutely need to purchase a relay for this product in order for it to work correctly and it makes it louder. I installed it (both Low and High note horns) on a Yamaha motorcycle, which had two stock horns . It is not an air horn, sounds more like a Buick Station Wagon than a Honda Accord. I would recommend this product but for a louder horn I would look for an Air Horn instead"
4,Great replacement for my stock Harley horn.,"I needed a replacement for my horn on my 2007 Harley Electra Glide Ultra Classic. The factory horn had stopped working several times over the year and had to be cleaned out and had to have silicon sprayed in it after every trip in the rain. The factory replacement was $45. This horn was $10. This horn fit fine under the stock cover, installed in about 3 minutes, and is every bit as loud as the stock horn ever was. The wiring ends went on the same as the stock horn, but were on the top side instead of the bottom side, but there was no problems with installing it. Time will tell if the horn holds up, but I think for $35 less than the junk factory one, I will take my chances."
2,Waste of money,"This horn blows, and not in the way it is supposed to. This is the ""LOW TONE"" version and it sounds really high toned to me. The packaging says this ""FREEWAY BLASTER"" is ""twice as loud as OEM horn"" and ""big rig sound"", a description that made me literally laugh out loud after hearing it. I bought this because the horn on my truck sounded more like the road runner MEEP MEEP and sadly this is only slightly better, and definately no louder. The only reason it got two stars is because it was functional, albeit not as advertised. Pass on this one."
3,"Well, if there's no other way to get it...","The ""LIVE AT LENINGRAD"" performance was originally released as a 90-minute performance and in this DVD it was cut to 50 minutes. This is inexcusable. (probably they cut the songs that would repeat after appearing in the Japanese show - but, hey, these are separeted performances!!)Anyway, this is sheer nostalgy. First, in the 1985 Japanese show, we have Jeff Scott Soto singing at the top of his lungs. Man, this guy can sing! At the Lenignrad show, we have Joe lynn Turner also at the top and Yngwie playing like never.Well, if this the cheap and dishonest way the record company decided to release the Leningrad concert, one must buy it..."
1,Bad video footage,"I bought this dvd because I had Trial by fire but lost it.This dvd has trial by fire but all the songs I like are missing like far beond the sun and black star.They are on live in Japan which is included but the way it was filmed really sucked.It made me sea sick just trying to watch it.The bad camera work ruined this dvd,dont order this,youll be sorry you did,"
3,Hachiko Waits,"After watching, 'Hachiko, A Dog's Tale' which is in my opinion the greatest dog character ever, I was interesting to know more about the real man and his dog. The information flashed on the screen basically gives you only the man's name, location, and the years that the actual events took place. In 'Hachiko Waits', I expected the actual true story of the Japanese professor and Hachiko. Unfortunatley, the book is another re-creation of the story, not the true story. Perhaps this book would appeal to a child but as an adult dog lover, inquisitive about a unique relationship of extreme loyality between man and dog, this book didn't accomplish that for me."
5,behindlings,"This book is strangely inventive and imaginative, ironic in some ways, and impossible to leave it untouched for even a day. Not the ordinary hee-haa comedy sort of book, Behindlings leaves you wanting for more after reading every chapter. Barker's style of writing is fantastic, undoubtedly, and the book is, perhaps, colorful. No matter a bookaholic or not, Behindlings is a book worth your time, money, and focus."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT :( I WOULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS IF I COULD!!!,"This product is absolute junk! It looks well made and is described as sturdy in the product info and picture. However it is the most poorly made disappointment EVER! I purchased 2 of these for my boys for xmas, and couldn't even give these to my children. The tuners are just for looks evidently because the strings DON'T STAY TIGHT my husband tried to tune the guitars for the boys and they would not stay tight and ended up breaking. Even worse I was going to send them back but you have to pay the company it comes from to take them back!!!!! I threw them in the trash, (Austin Bazaar if I could give this item negative stars I most definitely would!!!) Please don't waste your money on this item, I'm sure you will be disappointed too :("
4,Good Introduction,"This book seems useful in that the author provides us comprehensive information of the multinational negotiations that the UNEP deeply got involved in the past. Yet, for those who expect the author to disclose some inside stories of the UNEP, this book might be a bit unsatisfactory."
5,perfect night lights,"We are happy with these night lights. We have them in every room and hallway. We didn't realize that they come 2 in each pack - so we ended up with twice as many as we needed, but are very happy with them. Nice glow, always work, classic looking."
5,Awesome,"I can run through the whole house naked at night, won't run into a thing.. Usually end up at the refrigerator. They are just perfect really if you set them up around strategically around your house.. You'll be able to go anywhere without stumbling for the light switch.They dim in the day but don't shut all the way off unless hit by direct sunlight"
1,Neither worked,"Unfortunately neither of these nightlights worked. One flickered, the other was on all the time. Neither of the motion detectors seemed to work. I moved between various outlets and they did the same thing no matter where they were plugged in. I would return them, but it would probably cost more to ship than I'd get back."
5,Great nightlight,"This nightlight turns on automatically just like it's supposed to, and provides a nice but not overwhelming glow. I have one in my bedroom, which my husband and I are sharing with our infant daughter. It's great for seeing where I'm going when I get up to feed her in the middle of the night, but it's not so bright to keep me awake all night."
4,Night Light,"Good light, but the light sensor is not sensitive and not able to turn off the light unless under direct sunlight."
3,Seizes up in extreme cold weather,"I purchased this for my 2008 smart car in May of last year and it was FANTASTIC!!! Then the winter came upon us in Toronto Canada and I noticed the sound got weaker... when the temperature was minus 20C it failed to work completely!!! If I depressed my horn for a full continuous 20 seconds... it will start to work again, but I don't want to wake up the entire community!! Its great when it works. Really makes people take notice. And it was very easy to install (even for a girl). Last week we had a warm day (10C) and it was working beautifully again. I guess these aren't really made for use in Canadian winters where the windchill can feel like minus 30C. I'm still happy with it, but for next year, I think I will switch back to my factory horn before the first snow fall."
1,A formerly great product now cheaply made but sold at the same price,"I use this horn on several motorcycles. It is compact enough to fit well, and loud enough for its size.Those who want a louder or lower pitch horn will have to look at a larger, more expensive horn.However, since they have outsourced their production to China, the quality and reliability have gone down the toilet. The last one I bought was a terrible disappointment, both in quality of construction, sound and longevity.The chrome plated model is a joke, now. Mine turned green in a couple months in a damp environment. I ride to work, so it sits out in the weather in the parking lot.Too bad. I really like my earlier Italian ones."
4,Better than the original beep-beep,"Installed on a 2008 Miata. Tone like a European sedan - not as many db's as a set of air trumpets, but much simpler and sufficient enough to get asttention. Installation can be effected on the same horn hanging bracket using the OEM power connector. It does require quite a bit of creative manual dexterity, the construction of a grounding wire, and the shortening of the mounting bolt supplied with the kit. All-in-all, a good proposition for the mechanically adept."
2,Not What I Expected,"Don't get me wrong... it's loud alright. But the tone is just awful! Got it to replace the wimpy horn on our 4Runner and it is no better. Be sure to listen to the audio sample... I was researching multiple models when I bought this, so I must've just forgotten to listen to it. I have no one to blame but myself for this but want to pass on to other prospective buyers. Install was pretty easy; it took maybe 25 minutes and that was with a run to the hardware store)."
3,Not terribly loud,I got this to upgrade from my Ninja's stock horn. Not too much louder. It looks like I'll be buying the Stebel Nautilus.
4,WOLO 419 Bad Boy Dual Tone horn,"This horn replaced the standard two-horn installation on my 2003 Camry and is a little louder than the previous two horns combined. Installation was straightforward. There was ample room to install on the passenger side at the mount point of the original horn. My single wire system allowed connection to the (+) side of the Bad Boy, but I had to purchase a connector and wire for the ground connection. I also added a small flat piece of metal to help stabilize the horn mounting as the mount point on the car was made for the original lighter plastic horn. Very pleased with the purchase."
2,Weak,I don't think this is any louder than my stock horn. Its a higher pitch which may give an impression of being loud but its not and I installed correctly with 14ga wire and relay. It definitely doesn't give the sound of an air trumpet horn.
3,Not very loud,This horn was easy to install but it is not a loud horn. I should have gone with an onboard air system and a train horn.
2,I expected more!,"Although it is surely louder than the OEM horn, I was kind of a dissapointed with its loudness. I guess it is good enough, but it doesn't live to its advertizement, but since it is already install, I'll keep it."
4,not as good as speak english or die but,"it is still awesome. i don't think s.o.d. will ever match speak english or die but this record amazes me. its one of my favorites. the lyrics focus on humor but a few songs manage to come off as serious. it still has the s.o.d. polictally incorrect stuff too. i still love the humor though, bands who put it in their music don't get enough respect."
2,Won't purchase this one.,"While I did not purchase this item, I did however try it out to see just how well it works. The packaging states that this product ""kills"", when in actuality it really only dazes the pesky insect. I tried this on a common house fly and was surprised to see the fly get up on its own accord and fly off in less than 5 minutes. Great concept, but a little flawed. The netting is spaced apart far enough that an insect can even go through the net while swatting at it."
5,YOU GO GIRL!!,What a great version..When are we going to give Cyndi a second chance?C'mon..She was awesome live at the opening for Cher..even Cher was amazed..You go Cyndi!!!FIVE STARS..You got to have this cd!!!
4,Great for early walkers on slippery floors,"I bought these when my DS was newly walking on our hardwood floors. They have been great for that purpose. They always stay on, they keep him warm during these winters months, and he's had great traction as he's learned the art of walking. I'm ready to buy the next size up. They are true to size, in my experience."
1,Won't stay on,"I did not like these socks. They were not worth what I paid. They slipped off too easily. They are thin too, where I live I need them thicker. The only socks that worked for me were fisher-price socks, only problem is I can't find them anywhere. I do not recommend you buying these socks if your child always tries to take off his socks. The fisher price socks he can never get off. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Oh No He Didn't,"Lots of travel in this ninth book of the Left Behind series! Believers traveling to refuge in Petra, the Trib Force spread out again....Around the world, those who have taken the mark of loyalty begin to suffer from boils (the first ""Bowl Judments""), and oceans are even turned into blood as we move further into the last half of the Tribulation. As the newly self-declared god, Nicolae ""desecrates"" the temple in Jerusalem by setting up his throne and attempting to sacrifice a pig, a major insult/faux pas/way to make people mad. Hattie takes a stand, Chang wrestles with his double marks, and Chloe goes on a mission.All in all this wasn't necessarily my favorite of the entire series, but I enjoyed this book and can freely recommend it."
2,Even Less Filling than usual...,"Although I will admit to haveing read all of the series (I am hooked on the concept), I now feel the authors are are dancing on the edge of breaking the commandment 'Thou Shalt Not Steal'. This would have been a great 3 or 4 volume series. The good news is that I have found that it is possible to read the entire book in about 3 hours ... (find a comfy chair). Try it next rainy day."
2,Dying a slow death,"Reading this series has become painful! There is so little content, so little suspense and thrills that I have a difficult time staying engaged. What little substance there is to ""Desecration"" could be summed up in a few chapters. Literally! (...)"
1,greedy authors,The series is being stretched way beyond what it should have been. The simple reason would probably be greed. $$$$ seems to always corrupt the good in things.
2,This was not the best book,"This book was not the most exciting book in the world but it was decint. It did however inform us about what has happened in our past, but then goes and puts a huge twist on everything to make it alittle more exciting."
2,Not worth your time,"This book is incredibly boring and really has no point. It has an extreme lack of characterization and the plot is so messy. It skips around from person to person and is written in such a way that you have no idea who is saying what and who isn't. This had the potential to be a good book, but it was written way below its level and seems to be more of an indignity on Christianity than a helpful force. It's more likely to make people fear God than bring them to Him. It kind of does the opposite of what it seems to be there for. So, I'd recommend to stay away from this book."
3,Great story but....,"It's WAY too short. I was one of the few (well, ONLY) who took my behind out to Family Christian store at midnight for their sale October 30 to snag this puppy! Feel now somewhat let down for all that buildup to wait for it to come out! It was a very quick read for my husband as well, he read it in 6 hours, and he's usually got his nose in the books for at least a couple days! He couldn't put this one down though, but kept complaning about how ripped off he felt for waiting for months for this book to come out, and how the type and spacing seems bigger, and margins seem smaller (making the book look fuller!) I am glad that I have checked out the other reviews, I am going to get him that Christ Clone Trilogy if I can figure out who writes it! Thanks so much!"
2,First and last of this series that I'll read,"After all the hype about this series I finally relented to read the latest installment. What a mistake! I went in with low expectations but was still disappointed. I at least expected some high action end-of-the-world biblical stuff, but what was there was just silly paper-thin interpretations of prophecy which displayed absolutely no imagination. What I did find was endless talk about uninteresting characters and the plan of salvation. The Antichrist in this series is a buffoon! For good apocalyptic fiction I recommend Stephen King's THE STAND or James BeauSeigneur's CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY."
3,getting tired,"I have read all 9 books thus far and I have enjoyed the ongoing story to a point. The biggest issue (other than some inaccuracies about the Catholic Church)is that this saga could be told in three or four books, not the nine published so far. The authors spend a lot of time going over the same things in each book. The stories tend to drag on. There is a lot of useless dialog that really doesn't lead the reader anywhere. I will read the next book, but it will be my last if the story doesn't advance more quickly."
2,I'm Glad I Didn't Pay List Price!,"I've read all of the previous books in this series and eagerly await each new installment. But, the last several books have become boring, predictable, slow moving, and devoid of any real suspense. This one is the worst. You could easily skip it and save yourself some money! When you've finished you don't have any more insight into the characters than before you started. It seems as if Jenkins and LaHaye are just marking time until the end."
4,Keeps me coming back for more...,"Another in the excellent fictional rendition of the end times. Yes, there are things about the books that frustrate me. The Trib team's unlimited resources, always an ally inside the government who takes care of everything, technology that works perfectly every time, etc. And yes, there are some theological nits to pick. But on the whole, the characters and stories are compelling enough to keep me coming back. The pace is good (about 2-3 hours/book for me, an average reader) and the stories move along well enough that I cannot feel bored. I cannot give this one a five star rating for one reason (spoiler coming up, for those who haven't read it). Who ends a book with a nuclear bomb in mid-flight headed towards the good guys?!? I mean, come one! But I loved it anyway."
5,Beautiful CD,"Although at first I was a little disappointed when I heard that this Cd would be mainly covers, hearing it has taken all of that away. That voice continues to touch my soul - no other way to explain it. I am happy that Clay is finally writing - after hearing ""Lonely No More"" I can't wait to hear other Clay songs. This Cd should really increase Clay's fan base."
5,Outstanding Vocals,This album offers excellent vocals with hauntingly beautiful emotions and original productions of quality love songs. Clay's voice is a real treasure and this album won't disappoint those who want to listen to music that is sung extraordinarily well.
5,A Thousand Different Ways,"I have to admit, I love Clay Aiken no matter what. But I thought A Thousand Different Ways was excellent in any case. The cover songs on it were favorites of mine from way back but Clay's versions are better. And the 4 new songs were just magnificent! I'm impressed that Clay helped write Lonely No More. I think his songwriting skills are just getting started!"
5,Clays voice is amazing.,I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. So nice to hear a really incredible voice rather than some of the screeching out there today. Some songs soothe and others give me goosebumps.
3,Clay Aiken as a cover band?,I adore Clay Aiken and his voice. The originals on the album are awesome but the remakes are a little boring for this 29 year old. He sings them well but I think he is better than straight up cover. I hate to rob him of the extra $$ but I wish I had just bought the original songs on ITunes and saved the extra money.
4,A Thousand Different Ways,"We really enjoyed Clay Aiken's performances on American Idol. This CD is pretty good, but not up to his best work."
5,get this one,"great cd....sure shows off Clay's vocal range, too. Definitely worth the wait. Thanks Clay! ;-)"
5,Worth every penny!,"If you've ever bought a CD where you've gotten 2 or 3 hit songs with the rest of the CD leaving you wondering if the artist and producers were high on something cause it sucked so bad....well, you can relax.What's there not to like about Clay's sophomore effort? For a mere ten bucks you get 14 great songs (15 if you get it from iTunes). Ok, so he's not gonna win many awards for doing 10 covers- that's Clay's problem. This is a CD that you want to get simply because it puts you in the mood. Just stick it into your CD player and let him carry you to another place - and just unwind."
5,OUTSTANDING!,I just love Clay's voice and this CD compliments his voice! Clay's version of the covers makes you love the songs more than the originals!And the four new songs - loved them all!
5,GREAT,"Clay sang these songs better than the original artists. Great voice, I would like to hear him something a little more upbeat, but it is still a great album."
3,Clay can do better!,"I am a huge admirer of Aiken's talents, but I am NOT a Claymate by any means. It pains me to say this, but I have to ask, what was the point of this CD? Clay's talent is wasted on most of these tired re-treads. Yes, he gives a stunning vocal as usual, but as a fan I want to hear new material from Clay. He deserves to sing ""his"" songs, not someone else's. This CD wasn't a total loss as I did enjoy 'A 1000 Days' and 'Lonely No More'. I surprisingly did like Clay's take on Dolly's 'Here You Come Again'. It was new and fresh to me and I have heard the original since I was a kid.For younger fans of Clay's who aren't familiar with these songs, I would recommend this to you. You'll at least get Clay's beautiful voice. For older fans, give it a pass."
3,Anti Climax,"Why is everyone jumping on the remake album bandwagon? Is there no creativity left in the music business? I love Clay and wanted to give the album 5 stars because we have waited a long time for more music.As usual, he sings all the songs fabulously but the fact that there is no new material on this album is just too safe. I would have been more generous and given it four stars if he put ""Don't let the sun go down on me"" on it."
3,I love CLAY but am disappointed in his new cd,"I am a huge CLAY fan and think he looks great in his new look!! I have waited soo long, as all Clays fans have for his new cd, and although I have endlessly listened to the cd, I'll admit I hate most all of the 70-80 songs. He sings all the cd songs sooooo beautifully, I just dont like many of those songs and didn't when they were sung in the past! The new songs are just wonderful and I find myself just listening to them. I wish Clay would of have had more new songs but I love anything CLAY sings!!I do hope we dont have to wait another 3 years for another cd and the cd will be full of only new songs!!!"
5,Makes my heart smile!!,Clay Aikens voice makes me smile inside and outside. Every song on this CD is warm and loving and he makes it special!!!!
2,I was disappointed,"Well, it's Clay, so the vocals are outstanding, of course. But I didn't realize before I purchased it that the majority of these songs were remakes. And, sadly, most of them are remakes of songs I grew tired of long ago and no longer care to listen to, no matter who's singing them. The quality is good, so if you like these songs, you will enjoy Clay's renditions. So, I guess while I am not ready to sell my copy on ebay, I was disappointed by this one and would recommend his first CD over this one by leaps and bounds. Unless, of course, you are under the age of say, 25, and have never heard these songs before . . . then go for it."
2,WHO IS THIS???,"As a huge clay fan and a self described ""Claymate"" I'm going to be honest about this and not just give Clay 5 stars because I'm a fan. This is not good. The Clay we all fell in love with on Idol is not on this album. Where is the heart and the soul we heard in ""Solitaire"", ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"", even ""Measure of a Man""? This album is more cheesy background drowning out Clay. Not to mention, what's with the breathy, soft voice??? Where's the powerhouse notes? I for one, am soooooo disappointed! Clay, you're selling out to exactly what you didn't want to be....an overly produced, overly marketed ""pop"" album. You were better than this...I hope you haven't lost it!"
2,Disappointing,Sound quality is lacking. I use Amazon Cloud Player but have to turn up the volume when a song from this album plays. I bought a couple of other albums at the same time and they play fine.
4,The Boss Hits The Big Time,"Okay, he may be the Boss, but I was never a huge fan, but a few weeks ago my pal Jen and I went to my other pal Tommy's house and we listened to song after song from the 70s to the 80s playing a game where Tommy would play the top singles of the year and Jen and I would try to guess what they were. Needless to say we were excellent at said game but what I noticed as we hit the 84/85 years was how much I really liked all the singles from this album.I knew I loved ""I'm On Fire"" which always had some sort of exciting sexiness to it, which actually would then conjure up this album cover (helloooo!), but then singles like ""Dancing In The Dark,"" ""Cover Me,"" ""Glory Days"", ""I'm Going Down"" endless good old fashioned rock & roll. Sure, his every working man schtick would probably get boring if I were to have a Springsteen marathon but 12 fairly fun songs keeps me feeling slightly patriotic, if only to stand up and salute that album cover."
3,"Probally should only get one star, but.......","there are a couple songs I like on here like I'm On Fire, an Elvis like impersonation, Downbound Train, OK. But it still goes that I think his vocal presentation sucks, and so does the title track, very overrated and dull to say the the least. But if you're a Springsteen fan, get silly and buy this album, a waste, but enjoy."
5,For Brent,This LP was in Brent Grulke's album collection. Brent was instrumental in bringing Springsteen to be the keynote speaker at SXSW 2012. The Springsteen keynote was like going to rock-n-roll church.
3,Information is great and there.. but to much wording..,"Im an experienced options trader but continue to read to fill in some gaps. Everyone can learn a thing or two and if it makes me money im for it. This book is a 5 out of 5 when it comes to the information. It has everything. However if your novice or someone who's done some trading but not an expert, this book is not for you. Options can be confusing to begin with; you need a book that straight forward and explains it in plain English. This book doesnt do that. The tone of the book is of someone that is extremely intelligent but socially disconnected. If you can get passed that the book is a great resource."
4,Informative and met all expectations,This book is very informative and comprehensive. It met all of my expectations. Well oranized and a great reference for my business library.
5,pretty decent jam,"This was goldy's first and last cd featuring too short, ant banks, bad n fluentz, pee wee. This is a whole funkdafied cd and like most west coast acts goldy samples and dedicates his work to the p funk and gives a shout out to the original funkateers."
5,Back on the attack!,"Yes, they are back....new rock....new greatness....probably touring with AZ greats NGS at least for a little ways. Picture Weezer with Ska riffs and you got it! get this! Buy it now....click!"
5,Best CD ever,"This cd can be played over and over and you will never get sick of it. When I first got it I thought that they were okay now I think that they are amazing. It is a definite must to add to your collection. I also recomend Return, it is a lot different than their original stuff, but it rocks!"
1,"SHAQ CAN PLAY BALL, BUT HE CAN'T RAP!","This CD is terrible!!! I don't know what Shaq thinks is so special about himself, but I think he is awful!! He has a terrible voice! Whoever has this CD, and likes it, needs to get there brains examined! PEACE OUT!"
2,not horrible...,"only a few good songs. Most of the beats are alright but Shaq is one dimensional as a rapper. Biological didn't bother, nobody and my dear are worth checking out."
5,An Interesting Life,"Well-written, for grades 4/5 - 10/12. Jenny Lind was an amazingly determined, self-disciplined, humble woman with an extraordinary voice and life. The peak of her career spanned the 1840's and 50's and criss-crossed the globe. Her early childhood is particularly poignant and that is where this book starts. Her difficulties in finding true friends and supporters were no different from those in the entertainment industry today. Child stars have a really tough time reaching a profitable adulthood without serious emotional problems. But Jenny had an inner strength and focus from a very young age and was able to withstand, overcome, and eventually flourish in her chosen profession. There are other, older youth biographies available. I have read only this one. It is quite thorough and naturally oriented in the female direction. Probably it's best readership will be found in grades 6/7-10/12."
2,"Not enough Stooges, but some funny scenes.","This was a boring film, but there was one scene in it at the end of the movie that made sitting through it worth while. Some actor (don't know who) rivals Jim Carrey with his imitation of different sounds."
5,Great reading.,"Surprising you at the turn of the page, even the after the full stop of the phrase. Easy to read."
3,You don't need this book to read the other Discworld books,"This book is not the best in the Discworld series. If his second book had kept the same quality, I don't think I would have read the remaining twenty-something books. It is inconsistent, ""fumbling"", and I was at times wondering if he had taken some D&D game and just transcribed action from it.But there are passages where his wit shines through, and the book is plain hilarious. He does let his imagination have totally free reins, which is something I miss from roughly book 10 and on: The Discworld should never have been mapped."
4,Colour Started it all...,"Since ""discovering"" the books on a trip to England about 12 years ago, I've been hooked. The Colour of Magic (English Spelling) is a refreshing, ironic twist on the common fantasy novel - and funny to boot.On re-reading, I had to drop it to 4 stars, only because Terry Pratchett's newer works have raised the bar for writing in general.One of the most famous fantasy series around, they are still fresh with 25+ books so far written. Enjoyable, enigmatic, you even have to think occasionally.Cheers,BilFish"
3,A so-so start to the discworld series,"In many a movie series or book series, the first installment tends to be a classic. With the colour of magic, it seems to me that Pratchett was still refining his writing chops and that this installment is inferior to his later discworld efforts.Sure, The Colour of Magic introduces you to the nuances of the discworld, but the first half of the book is incredibly dull and pointless. I'm told the second book in this series is much better, maybe I'll check that one out next. An okay read, but for completists only. As discworld is not a continuous series, you can skip this one and explore one of his later, better efforts instead."
1,So boring and lacking in wit,"I read this as a student after being told it was just too funny not too. Sadly I have never been able to grasp the humour. I found it dull, boring and lacking in wit. I appreciate plenty of people love the story but for me, well, I found it greatly disappointing."
3,It's ok,"I was recommended to read this book because I was in search for something with the likes of the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, but I'm only 75% into this book, and only finishing it just to finish the book. But I wasn't into it that much.But for those that like books about wizards, and magicians and gargoyles and stuff like that, then this would be your book."
5,It all begins with a turtle,"Discworld, What can one say that hasn't already been said. This is a book that makes you want to laugh out loud and enjoy the experience. A literal cliffhanger or is it Disc-hanger. You have to read the sequel ""The Light Fantastic"" To see if Rincewind survives. Just a quick note: Try to control yourself on public transport, people don't understand if you are laughing on your way to work."
1,Wrong Area Code for the DVD,The DVD I ordered was send in the wrong code for South Africa and can not be played in our DVD Player. To return it back will cost a lot of money? Do you have a program I can use to copy it in the correct format to play on our DVD Player? I will appreciate if we can correct this problem.RegardsPhilip BothaItem being reviewedThe Inn of the Sixth Happiness
5,Bringing back good memories,I bought this movie for my mom. She had it on tape but that included commercials because she could never find it in stores. The quality is pretty good. This is a great movie and I was so happy to see it was finally in dvd!The Inn of the Sixth Happiness
4,Interesting read,I enjoyed this sequel to Italian Neighbors. Mr. Parks gives us a glimpse into the real Italian family and day to day life.
5,Niiiiiiiiiiice!,It's The Stone Roses... what more do I have to say? The tones on the album are just as sweet as you can get. They have this auditory sensuality that comes through their music that makes listening to it that much more enjoyable. I could listen to this over and over again... and I do!
4,Outstanding Cover,"This MCD features the simply fantastic cover of Kraftwerk's ""The Model"". Lush and terrifically programmed, former singer Kristin Buckman's breathy vocals make this one a real classic, infinitely deserving of club play.The uptempo Simulator Mix of ""Defeatist"" is far superior to the original version. Very similiar to Olive. The Black Cat Mix and the System 22 Mix while interesting, slow the tempo down a bit too much. ""Lost Again"" is ok as well.Buy this for ""The Model"" and the Simulator Mix of ""Defeatist"" and check out the other tracks every so often."
1,Idea was good so I gave it a star BUT...,"Leslie Stone goes around acting like she is smarter than everyone, judging people about their way of life, mothering, and everything else yet, she is a lousy mom, a lousy wife, a lousy detective and a lousy human being.She neglects her children, she leaves her 10yr old to take care of her 4yr old, she feels absolutely no remorse about her adultery and she is so rude to everyone!Maybe the writer was trying to portray a headstrong, sassy personality, but to me, it just didn't come across that way.I couldn't even sympathize with the trauma she was supposed to be going through.This was the first Leslie Stone book I have read, and I don't think I'll read anymore from the series. She was one of the most unappealing, unemotional and selfish character I have ever seen. Even when she was trying to act like a protective mom, or a righteous cop, It seemed unbelievable like she was faking/mimicking emotion. This woman seemed almost borderline psychotic."
4,Left me anticipating her second book,"This is an enthralling combination of ghost story and mystery. I really enjoyed it. Leslie's story is paralleled by the story told by Eleanor, the ghost, of what happened in Five Mile House years ago and how it affects the present. Novak is a good writer who creates interesting characters and has a chilling story to tell."
4,An Excellent Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack is one of the best that I have ever listened to. The most beautiful song, Deliver Me, is track #13. This cd is worth whatever you pay for it."
3,okay,"I heard wonderful things about this recording... but was a little disappointed. It is good, but nothing spectacular."
2,Slow and Plodding,"The book plods along without a single instance of intrigue or interest for all but the last 30 pages. I kept waiting and waiting. Then the ending is so contrary to the way the characters were consistently portrayed, that it was just not very authenic."
4,Terminal Run,A very good read. Fast paced gets right to the point. Another very enjoyable read from Mr. Dimercurio.Read this and the other books by Michael Dimercurio you wont be dissapointed.
2,The Devilfish AGAIN?,For the most part I have enjoyed this series by Michael Dimercurio. But this latest book is just the same thing as the last. It's still a good book to read as it continues with the story but don't expect a lot of new twists
3,3 inches,3 inches can fit around 300 flashcards fyi. these are pretty durable and large but i give only 3 stars because they have a large piece that makes flipping flashcards difficult.
2,Okay,While I have enjoyed these books they are really starting to drag out. This book could have been reduced to one chapter. I will read them all.
1,"Pretentious, vacuous and boring!","I was greatly interested in the premise of this book as the literary investigation of a character who perceives the world through his otherworldly sense of smell. Suskin however very fast disappoints you by making his character a unidimensional freak (check out his birth!) and for the rest of his book remains at ground zero of the premise that he supposedly intended, although through an outrageously overwrought prose that consumes lots of pages that bring nothing but yawns. What would have been truly magical is the convincing description of a world through smells and the way to make it real to normal smellers. That was something that was too much for Suskin who confuses a sense of magic with the license to lazily concoct turn of events that only the most gullible readers would swallow. The only good thing about this drivel? It was only US$12!"
5,Perfume: A Story I'll Never Forget,"I read this book when I was 15, almost ten years ago. Probably re-read it 5 times just so I could escape into Grenouille's bizarre 18th century world. I lost the book in 1993 (lent it to an ex, never again!) and have been pining for it ever since. Thanks Amazon Books, I probably wouldn't find my favorite storybook without you!"
3,"If you like to read about where you're traveling, then buy this for France","Perfume: The Story of a Murderer the story of a ""nose,"" or a person with super-sensitive sense of smell. For a book about murder, the book moves very slowly. There's very little dialogue in the book; instead, the story progresses almost entirely by third-person omniscient narration that tends to ramble on. Ends are neatly wrapped up...too neatly. Reading about his quest to make the perfect perfume was entertaining and the descriptions of the methods used by parfumeurs was educational, but it's not the type of book that kept me turning pages in anticipation.The first half of the book takes place in Paris and the end takes place in Grasse. If you like to read books that are set where you are traveling, then the descriptions of the settings and the action that takes place in each will appeal to you."
3,Eccentric,"This book is quite unique in the character and the plot. I must say it was quite interesting to read about all the labor that goes into a perfume. The details are incredible. The book begun well, but then towards the end, the author lost me. It seems like he was throwing anything ""mad"" and ""different"" in the end to make Grenouille ""the moster"" he is supposed to be. This author has a promising future, but he needs to make sure the stories stay in que."
2,"Starts out as an interesting read, but fizzles...ZZZZ.","I was enthralled with the premise of the book when I first started reading it, but once the novelty wore off, the story left me feeling flat. By the last third of the book, I ceased to have any interest in the main character's thoughts or experiences, and finished the book only for the sake of completing it as opposed to caring how the story ended."
2,"Wierd, Wierd, Wierd!",If you like something a litle 'different' and than this is for you.A little morbid towards the end....Really makes you smell everything after you read this.
5,"Once you take a whiff of this book,...","...you won't be able to put it down!! I got this book as a sweet gift from my boyfriend. I had just finished reading all three books by Thomas Harris following our attendance to 'Hannibal'. I was thirsting for more literature on a fiendish character who had intelligence, wit, and allure. I was skeptical at first but I trusted my boyfriend's judgement (he had read it previously). Well, when I started to read it, I found myself drawn more and more into the book as if being drawn toward someone or something's alluring scent.The story is about a boy who has no scent and because he has no scent, he did not have a presence. However, he had a gift of smelling. He could smell anything and everything. His nose is so good that he can describe someone without having seen them at all. In fact, his goal is to make the ultimate scent that nobody could resist. And he does this by....You'll have to read and find out!!"
2,"Exceptionally well written, but exceptionally twisted!","I had no idea that this novel was so well received when I chose to read it for a sociology class on deviance. Granted, the author did choose a very unique subject, the search for the ultimate ""smell"", and wrote in a very realistic and vivid way for his audience, but.... I thought the story line to be very tiresome midway through the novel, and the plot, frankly, disgusting. The ending was so unexpected, twisted, and out of the blue, that even the author seemed to be tired of the un-ending storyline. I did NOT like this book. I did not identify with any of the characters, nor did I discover any paticularly meaningful ""hidden message about life"" from its pages."
2,"unique, but not enjoyable","The sense of smell is a deserving subject. For a lighter and more clever take on it, try Jitterbug Perfume by Tom Robbins. Perfume plods along; much effort is wasted trying to garner sympathy for a completely flat character. As a female reader, I find it a bit annoying that the women who smell the best also happen to be incredibly beautiful."
2,(Doo doo brown) Smells like teen spirit....,"Nothing happpens, and when it does it's completely banal. I should have smelled this one comin'. The nose knows and this one stinks. As a friend stated, ""I can see how most of mainstream America i.e those who subscribe to People Magazine would love it."" Sure, Suskind adeptly evokes a time and place , and yes, the idea of a ""hero"" who rises to fame via the sense most taken for granted is quite novel, but these things do not an interesting story make. I read the first 50 pages and didn't care enough to find out what happens. And even when I was told, I was long past caring."
2,This Purfume STINKS!,"Having seen the movie trailer I decided to read the book prior to seeing the movie. I could hardly wait to dive in, since it seemed like a unique idea and had so many good reviews. It wasn't long before I was disappointed. I felt that the characters were somewhat flat and I never felt any attachment to the main character. There were several areas of the book that were endlessly dry and painful to read. The ending had left me feeling like I had wasted my time. I'm not really sure what all the hype is about.Perfume received two stars instead of one, because it was interesting to read about the 18th century perfume industry.I actually chose this book for my book club and, unfortunately, the other members were equally disappointed."
3,Dark,"This is a dark and quirky story. The writing is very descriptive and the book can be difficult to get into, but once into it, the story was interesting."
2,Not what I had hoped...,"This book does offer some great visuals but the character is not likable enough - even enough to pity at the horrors he creates - to want to know what or even why he does the things he does. It does open your eyes (or nose!) to a sense that, I at least, don't pay too much attention to living in our sterile society and I did give my little nephew a big sniff when I saw him and realized that he does indeed smell like caramel BUT still not enough to recommend this book. It's just too dark (and I like dark) without a point."
3,repetitive murder,After finishing this novel and thinking about Grenouille's (that's a little frog in French) virgin perfume... I kinda wished that someone had killed him in the cesspool that he was born in at the start of the novel. The novel would have been much better without the incessant murders and moving on...scentless indeed.
5,A Elegant book well worth the read,This is a fantastic book by a fantastic authur that should be read by everybody.
5,Entertaining Read,I started SHAKEN AND STIRRED on the onset of a trip and I thought I would read it in my down time. The book was so compelling and enjoyable that I ended up reading it within 48 hours. I found myself reading late into the night. The characters were real-life. What I liked about this book was it had some intrique with some romance to hold the reader's interest.
2,The little rack that can't,"While in theory this is a great idea, a simple way to hold ribs on your smoker. In reality the space between the holders is too close, removing every other one solves this problem. But the dividers like to flop around at every opportunity. In a pinch it works, but I would suggest a holder with dividers that do not fold down."
3,building toys,"This was very hard to construct- needed alot of adult help. Good for parent/child project but definitley not a ""do alone"" for child. My son became very frustrated with bricks not staying in place and time delay needed between levels. Cant be completed in an afternoon because of drying time needed. It is nice that it can be put in water and redid later. We have many of the items available in this line. Look ok when complete but not as good as pictures!"
4,fresh from the farm,"The Hiero crew does it once again. If I have to pick a singular group who has added more style and flavor to the hip hop scene in the past decade, then it's the Hieroglyphics. The Souls of Mischief are an incredible sample of some of the raw talent that lies just under the surface and all the way to the bottom of this crew. This album is no different than the rest, in that everthing on it is innovative and explosive. You can't not own every track these guys have laid down."
1,Time to take a day job homies.,"Look into these souls and what you will see is not rap purists but diabolical cynics. Sure, maintaining the head-to-head MCing tradition of hip-hop if admirable (in a pathetic, get-with-it sort of way) but it's just another angle to sell their bottom drawer wares. This person's a wack MC, that persons a sucka MC - who cares. The music isn't even good enough to be hedonistic; it;s just shallow, harmless fluff that gets old after a short while. perhaps it's their upper-middle class upbringing that deprives them of a point-of-view, but surely their somewhat successful (they did get on Yo! MTV Raps) foray into the rap game has supllied them with one. Maybe they're just too shallow to express one. I just wish they'd express anything besides the fact that people we don't know or care about are wack. Grow up."
3,Works but some issues,"Difficult to fit in case. Also I noticed you don't get any use from it until you are more then a few feet deep in water, as I am fishing on a shallow channel, and you don't get a full range to 0 feet. I also noticed sometimes the depth is inaccurately displayed and bounces around. I don't know if theses are limitations in the transducer or the fish finder."
3,seems ok,these binocs are ok for the price they cost. mine provide not great but ok view and everything works as it should. however - particularly with the max. 15 x magnification - the view gets a bit dark and more difficult to focus. they are very compact and come with a ok carry-bag.
1,Neat Binoculars but they have a problem,I received this binoculars as a gift from my wife. They were light and adjustments were fast and simple. The images were very sharp for this quality of binocular....I was very pleased. However after about two weeks the left lens will not adjust when I use the zoom. It seems to be stuck on the lowest power. Obviously this makes the binoculars useless unless I want to use the lower power all the time. I'm returning them for repair or replacement.
5,Great Album,It's a very enjoyable album I wish Angelzoom was better known because the music is consistantly enjoyable and the lyrics are always very clever
3,Did not work for me,"At first it was working well, however the turning wheel get a bit stiff. After a few weeks of trying to adjust all 4 outlets 1-2 got hard to control. Wheel did not turn flow on or off. Maybe its just me but mechanism just not the best. Rated 3 since i think its OK, but not the best option. Have it sitting in a drawer since i cannot risk failure of air circulation. Adjusted air flow, and a few days later had to adjust again. Just not for me, so ill stick to standard air splitters."
4,There is no fault but no fun.,"Mozart's Violin Sonatas of Hahn is too clean instead of the unpleasantness of Anne-Sophie Mutter, and there is no fault but no fun in Hahn's Mozart. I think that it is not more than the average point, though played well in K. 304 and with a rise in K. 526. It is easier to listen more than Szeryng and Haebler, but it doesn't reach far from Mark Steinberg & Mitsuko UchidaMozart: Sonatas for Piano & Violin in F Major, K. 377; C Major, K. 303; E Minor, K. 304; A Major, K. 526in interest.Natalie Zhu is good.Recorded in 2004."
5,Marvelous Mozart! Hahn and Zhu are superb!,One can only imagine what Wolfgang heard in his mind when he wrote this.I imagine it sounded just like this.
2,The only one I could find in the United States.,"This was the only CITY MAP of Saigon that I could find. Unfortunately, it sucks. Many of the streets are not labeled, the layout is a little strange, and the entire back-side of the map is blank (you'd think that they'd find a way to use that space with useful information). I'm glad I got it for some basic planning that I needed to do before I arrived; however, better maps are available in Saigon."
4,The perfect Childrens book for ADULTS,"As with many Dahl stories this book is not really for children, but adults will love it."
4,Absolutly not suitable for children,"It's a black comedy story about kid but not for a kid. If you're adult, You'll like it.(nice picture contain)"
3,So-so comedy with two great actors,"A slow-moving, dry-humored, rather predictable comedy about a divorced couple who get back together after they realize how compatible they actually are with each other. It's one of the first feature roles for a young Jack Lemmon (who already had his sad-sack schtick pretty well polished...) and the not-quite-so-ditzy, not-quite-so-dumb blonde bombshell, Judy Holliday, in one of her lesser roles. It's not a great film, but it is fun to see the two of them, also interesting to see how consistently she upstages Lemmon, right from the start. (Originally released in 1954.)"
3,"It's not bad, but I'd go for Danby or Blackman.",Neusner has compiled the translations of several of his students in this work. There is an unevenness to the quality of translation. Some tractates are well-translated and others seem to lack the idiomatic quality which one who reads Hebrew understands in the original. Prof. Neusner is to be complemented for arranging the mishnayot in each perek in such an manner that they resemble the way they were learned in the oral academies of old and are still learned among students in modern yeshivot. As a second edition to compliment an already existing translation on your booksehlf I would heartily recommend it. If you're looking for that first copy of the Mishnah for your library get Danby's translation (Oxford Univ. Pr.) or Blackman's Hebrew/English (Judaica Pr.).
3,Ditsy Detective,"I really wanted to like this book, and had planned on purchasing others in the series. Sadly, the character Cece Caruso is a dumb bunny. Are we supposed to be endeared by her quirky personal carelessness at 40-something? Cece does not evidence deductive or inductive thought, just a random walk as she accidentally stumbles onto one thing and the next. Solve a mystery? Perhaps the author was being ironically truthful when titling her novel.On the plus side (the three stars), the author does weave in some history about the creation of the Nancy Drew series."
5,Great compilation,"I really enjoyed this book. There are wonderful excepts from many different authors and it gives a thoughtful and profound look into death and dying from some of the world's best writers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who works in hospice, or wants a stronger grasp of the human condition. Truly beautiful and well thought out."
4,Triple price,The suggested retail price is &4.99. Other sellers have this item for $3.99 or less. Why does Amazon sell for $10.99
4,Lot of Duplicate Episodes,If you're a fan it's a good set to have - but - it has a lot of duplicate videos that are on other disks!
5,Such a cute video,"First watched Shaun the Sheep at grandchildren's house.They love the series, ages 7, 4, and 10 mos. And of course me, their Grandmother.Such a nice change for children's shows. I thoroughly enjoyed it right along with the kids!"
1,What a joke!!!,"I read this book and then jumped on a plane to see Dr. Kaplan. My daughter has Autism and a lazy eye. He will charge you a CRAZY amount of money to see your child and then the parent is asked to do exercises two times a day.The exercises were way to difficult for my daughter and it was a big waste of time. Yes, the prism glasses help for a few months to straighten the eyes but then they don't work. Maybe a very high Functioning child would do better than mine."
5,Great book for riders at all levels,"I started riding quite late in my life and this book has been a great help to me. Whenever I encounter a problem I consult it again and it always gives me new ideas which work. I like especially the mixture of at home, on the ground and on the horse exercises. You can try basics safely first before you mount your horse. I am a Western rider and although its focus is English riding I was able to use it."
3,Excellent book...but not for me - yet,"Because I bought this book on the strength of all the positive reviews, I thought it only fair to give a slightly different perspective. This is definitely an excellent and thought-provoking book, but if you're really 'starting out' as a rider, and looking for a basics book, this may not be for you. I learn by reading, so thought this would be perfect, but it assumes a little bit too much knowledge for the stage I'm in, which is brand new beginner. I know that I'll go back to it later, and I'll get a lot out of it then, but I need a more basic book to get me started.So do buy this book, but if you're a true beginner like me, you might also need something else. (I really wish Michael Smith's Getting the Most from Riding Lessons was for Western riding as well as English.)"
5,one of the best yet,"Dear potential readers, This book is one of the best yet. So if you are a fan you won't be disappointed. The bad news is this is definatly the end. For now anyway. Everyone is gathered together. You'll find out just who is going to stay on planet Earth. And who will end up together. One of my favorite parts. There isn't much more that I can tell you without ruining it for you. All I can say is that if you are a Roswell fan this is a must read."
5,Love it,I love Justified and all of the Elmore Leonard books about the Raylan. This may have been the best one.
2,Riding the Rap - Leonard,"I'm not quite sure what I missed when I read Riding the Rap but I obviously missed something. I'm afraid that I can't honestly continue the string of rave reviews. Every character in the novel was flat and few were likable. While the intent of the writing style might have been realism, it was just plain irritating. Leonard has probably written some great books but it'll be a while before I go back to the bookstore to try another."
2,This is not Leonard's Finest Hour,"Having read other books by Leonard, I found ""Riding the Gap"" to be weak in comparison. The book is a tale of three unlikable hoods who kidnap a bookie with the intention of getting him to give them money he has in an offshore account. The kidnapping is investigated by a marshal, Raylan, who is a likable main character, but that's about it. He seems to stumble thorugh his investiagtion. There are few plot twists and little surprise. If this is the first Leonard novel you read, then you will probably enjoy it more than a seasoned reader and writer of hard boiled mysteries like myself. Instead of reading this book, try get ""Get Shorty"" by Leonard and then come back to this one. You will then recognize the tremendous skill of this writer."
3,From a Leonard fan: this is a disappointing effort,"Add up a simplistic plot, an extremely small set of characters, some underdeveloped dialog and you get 'Riding the Rap'. As a fan of Eddie Bunker, Dannie Martin, Leonard, Tarantino, et. al., I was expecting more effort on EL's part. It's almost as if this was written in a few weeks to fulfill some clause in a contract.Don't expect one of his finer works if you do pick this one up. It's cardboard-thin compared to his other works."
4,Very well paced and highly entertaining.,"This was my first Elmore novel, and it's made me eager to check out the rest. I'm a big fan of super-tough cops, and Raylon is right up there. Throw in a cast that's a little bit too ecclectic for the reader to take seriously, and you've got a book that you can't put down. My only problem was that we didn't really get to know anyone, they were all dynamic people, but I didn't think that most of them were three dimensional. And we didn't get enough of a look inside Raylon's mind. But the book goes so fast, any plot holes or gaffes are just brushed aside because the story is just that good. It's the most entertaining kidnapping and rescue you'll ever read."
2,Neither subtitles nor libretto!,"I have to agree with the previous reviews but gave it 2 stars because the performance was actually quite good. Amazon should be more careful about getting the product information correct. If anyone ""googles"" the title, there is a libretto (auf deutsch) available on line for those of us who read German but forget the web transliteration. Anyway, enjoy it if you have it and if you don't, do some research ahead of time to see if you can locate a libretto copy with an English translation."
3,Loves Enduring Promise,"The second book in the Love Comes softly series moves through time a bit to quickly. It does unfold the story of the life Marty and Clark share together. It left me taking a deep breath. Too much happens in it. I felt dissapointed yet ready for the next book. Over all it was a story that modeled how a family could be like and how life really is ""fast""."
2,Outdated,"All who hope to create Quake 4 after reading this book will be disappointed: The game engine described, Jamagic, is rather old and not very powerful. It can be used only for very simple games and simulations. Additionally, the book delivers only a very cursory description of Jamagic. It can be recommended for someone who just starts working with Jamagic for whatever reason, and has no clue how to begin. Not recommended for people who are serious about creating games - there are better tools than Jamagic and better books than this one."
4,good but some drawbacks,"A good quality pan.Drained alot of grease.But... Not safe when trying to get the top part out of the other pan. Exact same size- makes it impossible to remove while hot grease is in the bottom.Please, please wash the pan VERY WELL. I thought I washed it well with soap and hot water. When the much awaited meatloaf was eaten, it was gross, too gross to eat. It had taken on the taste of some chemical in the pan. (no, it wasn't the cook, same recipe I'd used for 20 yrs) So please wash the pan, then wash it again."
2,Her 1977 performance,I'm a huge Ree-head. But this dvd is old. It has been on the market for a few years. It's her 1977-performance in Paris. Don't let the new title and old photo deceive you.
5,"Moody, Dark and Brooding, but Beautiful","I was turned on to Switchblade Symphony by their Serpentine Gallery album, which I still really enjoy, but this (sadly their final!) album just blew me away with its moodiness and sometimes crushing but airy synthesizers. My title describes the way I feel about the music itself. The way the songs are constructed is very ingenious, too. I think these girls were both very talented at what they did and I was so disappointed that they stopped right after this album, since it was a big progression from their earlier work and I was quite anxious to see how they would follow it up. I had to satisfy myself by picking up the Sweet Live Witches DVD since I was never able to see them live. I recommend that for anyone who likes Switchblade Symphony as well."
3,Lots and lots of history,"This book covers a lot of ground. It looks at disciplines, some info on the feeding restriction, some example characters and history and history and history and history. More than half of this book looks at the history of the clan. Much of the description of the clan is taught in terms of the history around the lesson learned by the clan. As history goes, this is well done, but if you are wanting a consice description of the clan you will not find it here."
4,Very hip-hop in the fullest sense from Keith Murray,"I don't think that anything Keith Murray put after this release topped this one. Real, raw hip hop that Erick Sermon produced, but Keith runs the show with some hot rhymes, flows, and beats/music to match with his voice. He can be crazy and funny at times, but it's his style that nobody touched. Many of the songs are funky. I actually like the original version of the title song instead of the version made for radio that interpolates the Isley Brothers' Between the Sheets. The original version is RAW, all beats and scratches, very hip-hop and allows Keith to rap freestyle over the beats! I hope that Keith gets past some minor setbacks to make another hot album because his rap style is definitely missed."
3,Living Sacrifice - Self Titled,"I have been listening to Slayer since 1986. I have been listening to Living Sacrifice since the day this disc was released back in 1991. They do not sound like Slayer! This is a good speed and thrash metal release with excellent drumming and some good aggression in the music. ""Violence"" and ""The Prodigal"" have some excellent riffs to bang your head too."
4,Surprisingly Good.,"Seeing as there is an increase of all these movies on people being transporters [for example foreigner with steven segal] i expected it to be like the rest of them. ... and stupid. However this one was surprisingly good. There are 3 rules and Frank - the transporter manages to break all of them on just one transport. The acting is okay. The fight scenes are originally but in some poorly choreographed, however the originality of it all makes up for anything the movie itself lacked."
4,Great action!,Another fun action movie with Jason Statham. Parts can be a bit unrealistic but overall a fun watch.
2,The Transporter,"Totally wonderful film. Tons of action , but none of is unbelievable (this is NOT Spiderman, thank God). I am personally very attached to the location, in and around Nice, which I visit often. Statham is very cool and low key; Shu Qi is totally delicious. Her English is to die for. The French Commissaire is just wonderful. The driving action (this from a pretty crazy driver) is very satisfying. Luc Besson for ever!! As good as the best of James Bond..."
4,Junk Classic!,"This movie sets out what it intends to do. The ""plot"" as it is, is just a diversion for what guys really want to see. Mindless violence at it's best. I'd put it up there with junk greats like, ""Desperado"", anything by Van Damme, and ""Starship Troopers"". Pure fun all around."
1,The Transporter fails to deliver,"The idea for the film was so full of potential, but they blew it. The 15 minute car chase at the beginning was satisfactory, but still the best part of the movie. The rest of the material is predictable and childishly unrealistic. Was the men-only oil-wrestling scene really necessary? My guess is the producers blew all their money on the car chase."
1,Transport this movie in the Garbage,"This movie had everything bad. Bad directing,Weak script,Bad actors as well as actresses. Weak dialogue and that is the good part of the movie. The action sequence couldn't save this movie. This is a movie that never should been made."
4,decent,"this movie really is quite good. i usually like movies with a little more brains than this, but for some reason, this movie really caught hold of me. i really like the star in this movie. he really annoyed me in the one, and i thought he would in this movie, but he really made me like him. the way his character acts and dresses, he reminds me very much of the main character from the video game series: hitman. he dresses and acts so much like agent 47, it's astounding, all he needs is to be skin bald and have a bar code tatooed on the back of his skull. this is a nice movie if you just want something fun to watch, just don't expect it to change your perspective on the world."
3,"Great fighting scenes, so-so story","I bought this movie out of curiousity. It had an intriguing cover and I liked the guy in Lock, Stock and Loaded Barrel and Snatch. So I decided to give it a try. The premise is actually interesting. The whole rules thing is interesting as well. I can't say it was a bad story as so much as it was kind of boring. The story kind made you want to see the next fight scene, which kept coming.On the fighting, the movie scores an A+. The fighting makes the movie worth seeing. I'd say the fight scenes are just a notch below The Matrix in excitement but in my book The Matrix is the gold standard of fight scenes. Which means that they're pretty damn good.The ending is pretty anti-climactic and ho-hum. It's a good movie but not one I'd watch over and over again (my standard for judging movies)."
5,Jason!,"Wow. He still holds the record for my favorite actor! This is a MUST SEE!!! If you liked this movie, you will LOVE Crank!"
1,I cant believe they make movies this bad,"After the reviews I have heard about this movie I was expecting to be hooked into a thrill ride, but to my disappointment I was sucked into watching the worst movie I have seen in many years. I wish I had turned it off after the first pathetic 5 minutes.Below ""B"" grade acting, pathetic story line, and a sound track cut straight from an early 80s porn movie.The stunts and action was so choreographed that every punch or kick was filmed separately and then put together to try and form some sort of fight scene. It was more a comedy than an action movie as I was laughing at how bad it was. I dont know how this made any money at the box office.I couldn't believe I sat through the whole movie I will never get that 88 minutes back.Wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. There needs to be a rating below 1 Star."
4,An ideal action movie for someone who apreciates good action,"I saw this movie two years ago and I liked it. Very much. Great action, chases, plot points, martial arts and performances.If you like descent action films. Watch this one, but if you do not, watch KUNG POW (what?) O.K. Whatever you do, I suggest you RENT this one. That's what I did, 'cause it's not to watch it a thousand times."
4,Quite a Ride,"I got the feeling that a bunch of European guys got together and said ""let's all get rich making an American style action movie."" The film is formulaic and often predictable. In spite of that, it is a thrill ride. The hero of these stories could not be any cooler. Somehow, in spite of it's flaws, it is a masterpiece. A great success. It's like the Grateful Dead of movies, somehow the small flaws make it all the more endearing, I guess. If you're a fan of this genre of explosions and car chases, get this film. It's quite a ride."
3,Girl Porn,"Jason Statham, shirtless, greased up in a bus station kicking ass. Oh.my.god. This movie has a crappy plot & silly dialogue, but I own in because Mr. Statham is the hottest British guy ever. The action sequences are really good, and he does his own stunts. If Jason Statham & Vin Diesel made a movie together where they get in a fight & accidentally kiss, I would be in heaven."
3,"Awesome Action, Shaky Story","This is a great action movie. It has fast paced, funny car chases, excently choreographed fight scenes, and plenty of explosions. Jason Statham plays the cool, stiff English hero well, but without the deadpan sarcasm he pulls off so well in Guy Ritchie's movies. The other actors are fine when they are fighting, but terrible when they open their mouths. After a great opening sequence of chases and fights, the movie gets a little slow when it tries to develop a story, but fortunately the director quickly seems to give up on that and finishes with a lot more action. As long as you're expecting a classic man's movie, and nothing more, this movie should work for you."
4,"Speakers fine, service not so fine","We received the speakers, only to find that there was no way to connect them to our plasma tv without specially ordered connectors. We would have been happy to order those along with the speakers, had we known. After ordering the connectors, we were told that our total charge with standard 3-day ground shipping would be $32. After receiving a billing confirmation for $76, I called to complain. A CSR assured me that the charge would be changed to $32. We did receive the connectors...along with a total charge for $45. But the speakers work fine."
4,Never got so much attention over shoes,"I bought two pairs of these snakeskin boots a few weeks ago and got the first opportunity to wear the black ones last week. I have never seen so many people get excited about shoes before. No one would believe how little I paid for them (not even including the $20 Amazon kickback). The shoes are comfortable but I did have to return the first set to get a half size larger. The vendor paid for return shipping, so it was only a minor inconvenience but that's why they get four stars instead of five. Oh yeah, the second pair I got were the natural color and they are a little ""whiter"" than I would have liked."
1,Don't buy it.,Don't buy this book if the class doesn't require it. This textbook has many mistakes. Try to save your money or buy another book. Trust me don't waste your money to buy it.
4,Great Reminders,"Our morning Bible Study group is using this book along with the referenced scriptures to remind each of us how powerful our spoken words can be, both for good and for bad, both for ourselves and for those who hear them."
5,Investing Without Bubbles,"Bull, Maggie Mahar's sharp and very readable new history of the Bull Market,offers investors smart views of why the bubble happened, why it burst, who got hurt, who didn't, and where to invest now, keeping in mind financial cycles and important emerging markets like those in China and elsewhere in Asia. Mahar's engaging style and telling anecdotes give readers a bounty of knowledge that's both impressive and fresh. Not just another ain't-it-a-shame account of the bursting bubble, Bull analyzes the hows and whys. At the same time, it's fun to read. Should be a top pick for holiday presents."
5,Wall St. doesn't have my best interest at heart???,"This book does a great job breaking down the boom/bust cycles in the markets. From a history perspective, it is very entertaining. From a reality perspective, it is required reading for anyone investing in the markets. If you learn how people cheat or manipulate, you can sometimes avoid being manipulated or cheated in the future.""History does not repeat, it rhymes."" I forget who said that, but it is true. Learn about the boom/bust cycles and you can profit from them when they return. Understand the cycles and maybe when the music stops you wont be the only one without a chair.If you think the people on Wall Street are your friends, if you think CNBC is giving you good advice, if you think your 401k is a safe investment, even if you think the stock market outperforms every investment over the long run, then you really should read this book."
3,Be careful!,"Star rating based on lack of information in Amazon's description and APC's specifications, NOT based on quality of the product.When I compared these RBC55's to the RBC11's, the specs looked exactly the same based on capacity, physical size, and life. Unfortunately, it turned out that the RBC55's actually have smaller connectors than the RBC11's, which mean that they wouldn't fit into the old UPS for which I'd purchased them. APC's site did not make this clear at all, especially since newer models of the UPS we're using are actually using the RBC55's now. Very confusing. Had to return these and get the RBC11's.I'd love to see Amazon update their description to include information about terminal size and the models which this battery will fit."
2,Be Careful...,"If you're buying a Multi-region DVD player, one thing to note.Many PLAY DVD's from the UK, however they also output the signal in the same format, so you also need a PAL TV! Better to buy one with CONVERSION, such as the JVC XV N142SL (it's also $60 less!). This will play UK & other DVD's on your standard US (NTSC) Television..."
5,good jazz,"I first heard one of the tracks on the radio (I remember April), and was motivated to look it up and bought the album online. It's all top notch jazz from a total master of the piano. I recommend it. Great driving music. As good as it gets."
2,DISAPPOINTING...,"As a huge fan of Andre Previn and the various trios he put together through the years, I was stunned when I played this CD for the first time for a group of friends. They were as shocked as I was. This recording in no way represented that unique classic light inventive jazz style of Andre Previn. Even the producer of the album agrees. On the printed album notes, he says,""His (Previn's) funky sound is definitely of the era, but all his own..."" That era was 1958. There are 6 recordings in this album. Bands 1 and 6 have a tempo so fast, the melody is quickly devoured. Bands 2,3,4, and 5 are so SLOOOOOOOW, there is never a melody to begin with.If you want to hear Andre Previn at his best without his short-lived ""funky sound"" of 1958, pick up a copy of his ""Old Friends"" album. But as far as this album is concerned, forget it."
5,Search for Rebel Gold,"Fascinating book, well written. Interesting subject matter. Seems to be an on-going mystery as to what happened to the gold. Makes one want to go out and start searching for clues and gold.."
4,An excellent album for any fan of Motorhead...,"This album contains some rare and unreleased tracks from the gods of Motorhead. The actuall recordings themselves are a little rough, they are diffently crunchy, but still sound good. The high spots for me where, Shoot you in the Back, Louie Louie, Like a Nightmare and The Hammer. It was nice to hear the roots of Motorhead and realize that everyone starts from somewhere. I recomend this album if you are either a loyal fan or want to hear some real vintage stuff. I wouldn't recomend this album if you don't like the distortions that analog tape can sound like on a CD."
5,508 Stars In The Sky,"As a mother of four children, two girls and two boys, this was a favorite to all of them. A book of this caliber gives the children the confidence to read on their own. Very instrumental. We can't wait for the next one! Thank-you Mr. Allen"
5,The One Essential Album In My Collection!,It's the best record I've listened to in years. Powerful as few others. I recommend it to everyone!
5,"I really love listening to their album,Step one.All Songs!",I bought the album step one when we lived in england. Their second album is due for release there now. I cant wait until it comes here. All of my friends enjoy steps. we use to listen to them all of the time when we got together. I hope they really catch on in the U.S. because this is one group I would like to listen to for a long time.
1,Physically nauseating to listen to.,Are you having a laugh?! This has got to be the most God awful piece of horse excrement that somehow passed itself off as music ever shat into the universe. I hope that blonde bloke with psycho problems gets mangled by an escaped rabid gorilla (Lisa).
5,Great party music!,"I took a chance on this group I've never heard of here in the states and I'm glad I did. This single ""One For Sorrow"" was excellent! This song is very danceable and if you like dance music, you'll like this one. You'll feel like hitting the clubs. Unfortunately, only this one single is available here in the states, eventhough they have several successful singles in the UK. Their album won't be out until October, so grab this one while you can. Hey, it's only $3.00."
3,"It's cool,but could have been Better","Barry Manilow is a very talented Musician. I've always dug his Arrangements,Vocal stylings&the overall versatility of his work. I'm not generally big on Cover projects. this One is Cool because Barry is covering some Burt Bachrach material here. I would have dug some Motown from Barry.I could see Barry pulling off the Miracles ""Tears of a clown"".i was hoping for a few more things,but nevertheless Barry Manilow does pretty good here. Vocally He is on point&the Music is Arranged really Well."
2,Lots of Music...Very Little Passion,"I just finished listening to this album, and it was a labor of...well, let's just say a labor, and leave it at that. Now, I think Barry Manilow is a great craftsman, and maybe I just like his original material better, but this album was a yawn-fest for me. The whole CD sounded like something you'd listen to in a doctor's office while waiting for your name to be called. The only song I remotely liked was ""Can't Help Falling In Love."" His performance just seems phoned-in, that's all. He can do better."
5,FABULOUS ALBUM!,"This album is FABULOUS! Great selections, great arrangements, great voice! I HIGHLY recommend this album. You'll LOVE it!"
5,love it,I recently bought Barry Manilow Greatest Hits of the SixtiesI just love that cd. I thought it was very well done. I liked all the songs on it. I would highly recommend this cd .
1,why can't they go away?,"I don't get it. First Rod Stewart, now Barry Manilow has decided to mangle some classic tunes. They are has been singers who couldn't buy a hit, but for some reason if they warble a bunch of popular tunes, people buy their music in droves. Probably the same idiots that voted for Bush. Reality tv, Stewart, Manilow,... the dumbing down of America continues at a rapid pace. Why can't they just go away?"
4,Manilow - Hits of the 60's,"It's a great cd - my wife loves it! It's probably a better cd than his hits of the 50's, in terms of musicianship and listenability, so to speak."
3,IT COUL D BE BETTER!,"BARRY COULD PUT SOME OF THE FIFTIES, SIXTIES, LATER ON SEVENTIES AND MAY BE EIGHTIES, WHICH THAT I HEARD YOU MAY DO AND PUT IT ON ONE ALBUM,CALL IT ""DOWN MEMORY LANE"".END IT WITH ANOTHER TITLE TRACK SAYING GOODBY TO THOSE GOOD OLD SONGS OF THOSE DECADES. YOU ALSO DID NOT PRONOUNCE SOME OF THE WORDS RIGHT,OR YOUR T'S. THAT IS WHY I COULD NOT ENJOY THESE TWO TRUBITE ALBUMS. I AM VERY DISSEPOINTED IN YOU TO LOWER YOURSELF TO SCREW UP ALBUMS. YOU CAN DO BETTER.I THINK YOU ARE WASTING YOUR LAST SINGING YEARS ON THESE OLD SONGS. STOP LESTINING TO CLIVE DAVIES AND START THINKING FOR YOURSELF."
5,Really (really) fun -- Seriously toe-tappin' stuff,"Oh, yeah, baby. This is some serious 50s groovin'. A really beautiful trio featuring nimble piano, brushy drums, and bass solidly in place. Listen to it over and over until your head explodes."
1,"While he is a fine writer, I found him non-credible","While this man may have missed his calling in life as a writer, I found him non-credible. Why should we exhault a murderer. How is it that everyone forgets that two FBI agents lost their lives? How is it that we forget that FBI agents do what they do to protect each of us every day? How is it that people want to applaud a man that is a murderer? I am appauled at him and those that think he should be freed. Just because his people were persecuted many years ago, does not mean that he is an innocent man. Do we release every black man that has murdered someone from prison because his ancestors were slaves? Many years ago, the white man did terrible things to indians. These wrongs can NEVER be made right. However, to free a man that has not only killed two men, who had wives and children, but he killed two law enforcement officers who gave their lives so that everyone can be free and safe."
5,Leonard is one of this generations Hero's.,"Prison Writings; My Life is My Sun Dance by Leonard Peltier. A book written by one who has benn incarcerated for over 23 years for crimes he did not commit. A courageous man who cared for the welfare of his People, who still cares for his People.

Anyone and everyone who is concerned over the misjustice of our nations legal system and the continued road to extermination of our People, the forgotten minority, should stand in line to purchase this book, It is a book that is raw in emotion, pulls at your heart and leaves one in awe of his stength, courage and love he projects after all these year. He continues to soar. FREE PELTIER"
4,An Excellent Performance video,This is indeed an Excellent performance video of Andrew Lloyd Webber.The best thing i liked about this video is that almost all orchestra is chineese. A good collectors video.
4,reprint of previous works,"this is just another reprint of her older books. it's deceptive because i have accidentally bought ""new"" editions of her work like this just based on the ""new"" title and then found out i had already read the books in the combined edition. both original books are good if you haven't read them, but if you're like me and read everything she writes, it pays to be careful when a ""new"" work by her is marketed to you."
2,"Once again, too much country/blues not enough rock and roll","This album has one really rocking song at the beginning ""Jump In Now"" and then it's all down hill from there.The two reggae songs, ""Shall Walk"" and ""Run-In"", are cool and interesting but not enough to legitimize this album's steep import price.Hey Izzy, you are supposed to be a rock and roll guitarist, so cut out this hokey country/Rolling Stones thing and do a rock album for once.Izzy Stradlin's first album with the Ju Ju Hounds was very good, underated completely, one of the best rock albums of the 1990s, but it's been all downhill since for Izzy.If you can get this album used and cheap, then go ahead, otherwise save your money."
2,Could have been better,"The actual Mysql coverage in the book is sparse. I found very little of the MySQL coverage that i expected as a beginner hidden between dense SQL and interfacing to PHP/Perl and Java.The chapter on accessing JDBC from MySQL had very little of MySQL-JDBC specific coverage,the saving grace was however faces that i had seen on the Linux Programming book from the same publisher."
5,Cagney is spectular in the great film noir!,"Cagney is brillant as a mad dog killer in one of the last of the great film noirs. To truly see the level of Cagney's acting ability, watch this in conjunction with another of his great movies, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". What a contrast."
5,One Of The Top Ten Greatest Crime Flicks!,"It had been a few years since James Cagney's ""Public Enemy"", and his song-and-dance skills had taken him to the top of the movie industry since that epic flick. Returning to the genre as Cody Jarrett provided moviegoers with a timeless performance that serious crime buffs can't afford to miss.Virginia Mayo and Edmond O'Brien round out an outstanding cast that brings this rollercoaster ride through every harrowing twist and turn of a dynamic and visionary plot. Jarrett is the last of a dying breed, staging a train robbery in the opening scene before giving himself up on an unrelated charige to avoid a murder rap during the caper. The police, wise to his scheme, set Jarrett up with an informer (O'Brien) as one of his cellmates. Jarrett breaks out of prison with his jailhouse crew to rejoin his girlfriend (Mayo) and his old gang for one last heist guaranteed to take him to the 'top of the world'.It's Cagney at his best...don't miss out, order a copy today!"
1,Boring & Badly Acted,"I was bored out of my mind when I watched this film. The ""cinematic"" quality is there, in terms of effects and editing, but the plot was poorly adapted and made it come off like it was from a badly-written comic book. I just found the whole thing contrived, implausible, and dry. There's very little done, wether in the directing, or the screenplay, to make you care about the far-fetched plot."
1,sorry this movie did nothen for me,"a wanna be action film , with subtitles 5 stars i think not ill give it one star for few good fights , while looking very fake they did take few chances here and for that ill give them a star , as far the rest these reviews , they seem paided off cause i saw nothen to warent 5 stars . wanna see a good movie on revenge try payback . want to see sick movie about stored hate check out american history x , the bite the curb part at start of that film .this movie could have been 5 stars with a real budget cast and no subtitles. dont be fooled by reviews here u can tell which reviews paided for , and which people bought the dvd with there own money and didnt get what they paided for , and often movies that get poor reviews from critics the ones to see, fight club for one . this about 10th time i have been fooled by these good reviews that someone paided their writers to hype up movie on this site."
4,"CREEPY, EXISTENTIAL AND ULTRA-VIOLENT","Revenge, it's said, is a meal best served cold. The creepy, existential, ultra-violent OLDBOY (Tartan) takes that dish and smashes it in your face with raging.Without explanation, Oh Dae-Su, a businessman with a family, is kidnapped and imprisoned in a dank, dirty room for 15 years. Suddenly he's released, given money, a cell phone and nice clothes. On his way to revenge, he discovers his kidnapper still has plans for him, and it's something worse than what's already happened. Now he's got five days to find him and balance the books.Rated R. Genre: Asian Noir/Thriller. 2 Hours. Actors: Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang, Dae-han Ji, Dal-su Oh. Director: Chan-wook Park"
5,"greatest revenge story since ""The Count of Monte Cristo""","This movie is part action, part intellectual drama, part mystery. The cinematography is highly inventive and dramatic and the plot has to be the greates revenge story since Dumas' ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" There is a moment in this film where it all comes together and it feels like you've just been slapped across the face. Highly recommended!"
5,Gets better the more you watch it,"I was recommended this film by others. So going into the movie, I had very high expectations. The first time I viewed it, I was a bit disappointed. The movie is definitely disturbing. Different. So back then, I would have given only 3 stars. But after a couple months, I went back and viewed the movie again. I don't know why I didn't like it the first time around! I can't describe the movie in one word. It has dry humor, violence, bit of comic book element to it, but it also carries a deep philosophical weight to it that cannot be ignored. I absolutely love it now, and I will be viewing it many times over in the years to come."
5,"This DVD is uncut, 120 minutes","Just to correct everyone out there who is saying this DVD release is not the full movie, I just watched the official DVD and it is indeed 120 minutes long, unedited and uncut. Not sure where the discrepency came from but you can be sure that you're not missing out on anything in the film on this DVD release.As for the film itself...brilliant!"
3,Decent,"This is one of those movies that was decent but way overrated. Don't let the hype fool you. Rent it, don't buy it!"
4,"Not what i thought, but good.","Well i read a bunch of articles about the movie, they all described the movie as great. The truth is that it's not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one. The story is kind of original (it's a pretty good story)however it's not developed as well. What i really liked about it was the style. Lighting, and stuff like that is really good. With a little more suspense it would've been a great movie."
2,not an action movie,"I bought this thinking it was going to be this great action movie, but I was wrong. The cover says ""15 years of imprisonment, 5 days of revenge"" sounds like a action movie right? wrong, its more like a drama/tradgedy, one of those asian films that are sad just for the sake of being sad, their isn't any revenge gotten by the main character, not even a happy ending, just made me depressed. If your looking for an action film THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I have no idea how such a terrible movie got such good ratings."
5,Where were you?,"Fine, this album went gold. DOes that matter to the people who made Reggies' other albums Platinum? It's a shame that i loved hip hop so much at one time, to see it so corrupted by the smell of $$$$$$$. this album is Redman's finest work ever. I suppose rap wasn't as listener easy back then,(my bad). I guess I don't know what rap really is."
1,whut the album,THE CURSE OF THE WAK RAPPER EVERY ALBUM SONG GUEST APPEARANCE ON SONG OR SONG REDMAN HAS EVER DID WAS WAK HE HAS GOOFY SOUNDING VOICE AND WHAT THE ALBUM IS BELOW AVERAGE ITS SO WAK I DIDNT EVEN WANT TO GIVE IT ONE STAR THIS ALBUM IS THRASH MUSIC AT ITS WORST!!!
1,DoNOT buy this!! it does not work with my dell laptop.,"Gosh, what a hassle! I would not recommend this product to anyone! It does not work with my dell laptop and the tech support folks are not helpful at all, they couldn't figure out why it's not working with my laptop (which I bought 6 months ago) trust me, I am a ph.d student in computer science, and I couldn't get it to work."
5,Insightful,"""I love you, Ronnie"" gives the reader access to some of the most beatiful and heartfelt sentiments shared between two people. Through reading the handwritten excerpts copied into the pages of the book, one gains a sense of the special relationship the former presidential pair maintain. I would recomend this book to anyone who believes in love and marriage."
4,"I'm not a Reaganite, but these letters are wonderful","I am NOT a fan of the Reagan era...at all. It was a time of high taxes; high inflation and more. But I must say I always thought there was something special about Ron and Nancy's relationship, and these love letters confirm it. These letters are absolutely lovely and poetic. I mostly bypassed Nancy's ""text/commentary;"" I just read the letters. They are beautiful."
2,Same Old Kindle Problems- Graphics;Tables and Formatting,"Don't get me wrong, this could be a great book and probably is in hard copy. i love my Kindle but looking at washed out graphics of (guess what?) resumes on a gray background is more than disappointing. It makes no sense when you can't read what is on the page. I just can't understand why a book on style and polish of maybe the most important document has such a poor layout with respect to tables, lists and graphics. Come on Amazon, you need to get this right. With 16 shades of grey/black, why not pick one where you can pull the text of the graphics out of the picture. There is nothing more annoying than reading two pages describing a great idea referring to an example and having to imagine what it was you were supposed to see.Come on Amazon try reading the books you sell !Get the more expensive hard copy of this book because this edition is almost unuseable."
5,Loved this book!,"This all-purpose, content-filled resume book has enough humor to focus your interest on what is essentially a very serious matter: you as a marketable product. One chapter (Chapter 3) stood out for me. It clarifies the use of hooks--when to use an objective and when to use a skills summary, citing advantages and disadvantages of each. I also liked the detailed chart on updating your resume for scanning technology and for sending it online. A very timely read!"
5,Best Moody Blues work since Long Distance Voyager album,"I purchased this fine CD a couple of weeks ago. An excellent mix of songs combining nostalgia, lost love, a strong love of life and just plain great sounding tunes by Justin, John and Ray. Even Mr. Edge provides the listener with another of his fine expressive poems put to a great music track. It's as close to a ""concept album"" as they have come for past 18 years. My only gripe I have is that Ray Thomas' track is less than three minutes long. It sounds great and is over too fast. I've listened to this album each day on my commute home from work (when I need to mellow out)and it sounds better each time I hear it. Hope this is only the beginning of another creative burst of energy for the Moodies. Excellent Work."
4,One of the all-time great bands does it again !!,"After waiting for what seemed like forever, the Moodies have released their new album ""Strange Times"". Although some tracks feel more ""moody"" then others, I enjoyed these songs immensely. All the guys were in fine voice and the music was uplifting. I do wish Ray was given more space. The tracks ""Strange Times, English Sunset, and the Swallow"" were my favorites. If you've ever liked listening to the Moody Blues, you'll like this album."
2,warning,this album has quite no musical continuity to Moodies's classical albums from late sixties and early seventies ! no song here could find its place there ...
5,One terrific cd!,"After an eight-year absense (seemed to me to be forever), I was surprised to find out that the Moody Blues cut a new cd. I found this out after a gentleman wrote to me concerning a review I wrote on an Alan Parson's cd (""Time Machine"") where I had mentioned that the Moody Blues were one of my favorite bands, but were rarely performing. It was this gentleman who told me about the new cd, and what a nice surprise to see this great band come back with such a solid offering! This is the Moody Blues at their best. This is one ""smooth"" set, and even the weakest offerings on it are, at the very least, musically interesting. Add to that Justin Hayward's beautiful voice, and I fell in love with this cd almost immediately. It has rekindled my interest in seeing a live concert (I've seen three Moody Blues concerts over the decades). Between 1 and 10, ""Strange Times"" gets a well deserved 9. I hope this is only a prelude to more things to come."
2,Are we all listening to the same album here!,"I agree that the album an overly self-indulgent half-effort. The exception is with THIS ONE, a collaborative piece where the Hayward/Lodge synergy seems to inspire them. THIS ONE should be a hit and could signal a legitimate new direction for the Moodies. Another respectable tune is MY LITTLE LOVELY by Ray Thomas. Why don't we hear more from this guy? Most of the rest of the album consists of sub par compositions, poor lyrics (John, what were you thinking?) and garage band guitar passages. And what a waste of an orchestra. Shame. Sorry guys. I know you are more capable than this."
1,perfect example of record company greed !!!!,"This clearly shows how greedy record companies place sales over good quality music. This album only had 2 good songs and failed by far in comparison to their much better albums such as Keys to the kingdom and Surlamur. OMD, No Doubt, Alan Parsons, and Christina Aguilara also have this same trouble. Except for Vitamin C, Dream, and Garbage your better off buying the singles instead. A few great songs usually no longer reflect on the quality of the entire album. All record companies should be forced to make at least 4 hit singles per artist before being allowed to make an entire album containing the same 4 songs(like in the 80's). That way they can't send out terrible albums based on only one or two hit songs."
2,Strange Times/Strange CD,"Strange Times was very monotonous and I missed the jamming of ""The Other Side Of Life,"" the Moody's greatest CD. The one song that I did like on ST is ""Wherever You Are."" Otherwise, they need to pick up the pace and give us some rock and roll."
5,Includes two extra songs,"As is this album isn't good enough! This Japanese release ofStrange Times includes, Highway (available on Time Traveller &Anthology) and This Is The Moment (available on Time Traveller). Also includes the booklet in Japanese. END"
4,thrasher!!!!,"firstly these guys are not heavy metal(iron maiden,motorhead andblack sabbath)now they are heavy metal.this is thrash.had this album 3 days,played it 3 times and now its getting there fast.changed style since act3(awesome album),stillmore riffs a minute than any other band.the vocalist sounds a lot better,the last track(word to the wise)could be a classic."
4,DEATH ANGEL ARE BACK,"This is a solid cd. I've had it for 3 days now and it gets better with every listen. It's not a straight Thrash album, but after ACT III why would you expect that? They manage to switch up styles very nicely and convincingly. There's a nod to punk, NWOBHM, thrash, some funkified metal, some hardcore. The singing is much better on this cd than any other DA release. There is a lot of energy coming through the music. It's nice to hear them switch up singers as well. Andy sings Spirit, Dennis sings Land of Blood, Rob sings Word to the Wise, and Mark does lead vocals on every other song. I would have given this cd 4 and 1/2 stars, but amazon won't let you. I would have given this cd 5 stars, but I feel ACT III has rights to that rating, this release is just below it. AWESOME."
4,WWII with zombies,"I first got this game for the ps2. Dont buy this game for the ps2. So after i sold the ps2 version I dicided to pick up the xbox vesion. After reading some other revies on this game I seem to find every one is relating it to halo. Why, Halo is like the god of all fps. Nothing can beat halo except halo2. now that we have that out of the way we can get to the game. Basicly looks like Medal of Honor. A game with far more realistic plot. But wait this game supports online play. I do belive that that my friends is a first for the xbox. YAY, WWII online. I love killing Nazis from the comfort of my own coutch(I know i spelt it wrong). So over all is is a fun experience. But if you can get a better game than that I would encurage you to play it. I mean I am not telling to buy this game that is wrong. But it is still good."
4,HALT!!!,"My friend Bobby Charalambos from Giannitsa is the Wolfenstein master and a genius at snipping soldiers form lookout towers and hidden crevices.My comments on the game are as follows:Pros:Excellent graphicsCool sound effects and musicGood enemy AIMultiple locations and many many levelsWide array of weapons choiceCons:A tad ""propagandish""Some missons appear out of context with war themeAdding ""occult"" creatures as enemies dilutes the war theme flavour of the game.Overall very challenging, thoroughly enjoyable and well worth a purchase.Additionaly, this was my very first game on the xBox and admittedly the gaming console is a pure gem!"
2,Good but some really major cons,"I think the game is very cool, but there is one major problem that I have with it. When you play in multiplayer split screen campaign you cannot save the game. Me and my friend played the game for 8 hours one night and then we found out that you can't save in 2 player mode, like you can in halo. This makes absolutely no sense at all why, would you make a game like that. The people who made it weren't thinking clearly. So if you like to play split screen don't get this game!!!"
4,not all that great,"I love first person shooter WWII games so I rented it. I played till I got to the first undead people you fight and was saying "" Cool dead people"" Then started saying "" boring "" Then I faced A huge dead creature and said""awsome"" then found my self saying boring again. The game takes to Wolfenstein then out then back again Plus no cheat codes. this game wasn't all that good."
1,Samsung Blows,"I'm on my 2nd Engine, and it is beginning to show signs of a pending failure (it takes 3 or 4 minutes to warm up and turn on).The Samsung Service dept stinks. I've been passed to different service ""managers"" too many times to count. They assure me that I will be getting a call from someone of authority. I've been waiting 2 months now. DON'T BUY SAMSUNG! 'nuff said."
5,Cost effective technology and a great picture.,"The DLP system produces a stunning picture for the price. Another important feature for those with kids is that unlike a plasma or LCD, you can't ""burn in"" an image by pausing a playstation game, etc. Set is amazingly light. Purchasers need to understand up front that eventually you will have to replace the bulb, generally at 3-4 years. Get a service warranty that includes coverage for a bulb failure.Also recommend purchase the Samsung (or other) DVD with a DVI interface. Movies are stunning with this feature."
4,Not Disappointed,"Harry Potter does it again. This book captured not only my attention, but the attention of the children I read it to. It lends itself well to reading outloud too which can not be said about many chapter books these days. Also, the teachers of the children noticed a marked increase in fantasy books being requested from the library, and the children actually read them.As to the book. It is a fantastical tale of growing up in two *worlds*. One where Harry *belongs* and much is expected of him because of who he is, and the other where he is a misfit, and can do no right.It is a mystery with quite a few surprising twists and turns where not all solutions are magical, and sometimes the most obvious is totally wrong."
4,Azkaban Could Turn You A Lurid Shade Of Pale,"The third book in the Harry Potter series turns a lurid shade of pale as three very important figures are brought into view. Sirius Black escapes from Askaban quickly becoming the wizarding world's most wanted. His introduction is met with ambiguity from Harry who is equal parts curious, scared and brave. Professor Lupin is the new dark arts teacher who has a fear of full moons and a past as one of Harry's father's former childhood friends. The third figure is actually of collective of wraith like monstrosities known as Dementors. How could you not be chilled by a creature that feeds on a persons fear and can literally suck out your soul with a kiss of death.Azkaban brought forth all of the fun one can derive from magical misery. The movie did a good job in copying the books mood. Both were thoroughly entertaining."
2,Kept dragging on,"I thought that this book was exciting at the beginning, but got boring as it progessed. I was very unsatisfied with the story, and the story didn't compare to the second Harry book. I thought that if J.K. Rowling could cut the book down a little bit, it would be much more enjoyable. If you want a short and exciting read, do not choose this book. But if you like stories that keep dragging on, by all means, read this book. That is why I gave this book two stars."
2,Quality so so,This library copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has some quality issues. The sound kept fading in and out requiring the radio to be kept on its highest volume level. (Not a problem until you tried to change the tapes!)
5,a great story,"This is the best Harry Potter out of the 4. It has such unpreditable twists and the finale is great although it makes your mind spin.Lupin is one of the best characters in the whole lot, in fact he and Sirius are my fave ones followed by Snape and Hermione. Harry is growing up and finding revelations about his parents and history. Also he is starting to notice girls. There are bits in this book that make me cry with laughter ...and others that just make me cry. The bit where Lupin and Sirius are explaining how Lily and James died is so moving, and the way Lupin, Sirius, James and Peter all messed up in different ways....If you loved Harry Potter you will love The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock, it's a MUST READ for any fantasy fan"
3,The Weakest of the Series,"Having read each of the HP books several times, Prisoner of Azkaban remains my least favorite of the series. While Rowling's writing style continues to improve (perhaps with the help of editors), the story and resolution in this installment are lacking.As the only book that does not contain a confrontation with Voldemort, the ending sequence lacks the excitement of the earlier (and later) novels. Using a cliched time-travel solution to resolve the story is disappointing. Furthermore, Hermoine's transition from utterly dislikable (throughout the entire book) to saving grace is too sudden.Sirius Black's character is shallow, and not very interesting. While his plight would make an interesting side-story, it is a stretch to use it as the central idea throughout the book.That being said, it is still an enjoyable book. It provides a decent transition to the much more exciting and interesting fourth installment."
5,A shocking addition to the Hary Potter Series!!,"Through the first two Harry Potter books we were amazed by the immagination and creativity that this author has produced. For this novel it is very much the same new characters and creatures are introduced that I believe will have a large effect on the story later on, the history of James is shown a bit more, as well as more of the school. Harry faces some of his toughest challenges yet in this book. Like in the second book many dangers are present off and on the quidditch field. Through reading all of the Harry Potter books up to this point this one is my favorite because of the introduction of these new characters. And with a convicted murderer on the loose you do not know how the story will end."
4,This was great.,I found this book quite interiesing. With ron and harry and herminie. I read it just for fun. It was about serious black and how he ecackeped askeban prison.
4,Better and better,"The most wonderful and satisfying part of JK Rowling is that each succeeding book is stronger and more well-written. This one is definitely a mature, thoughtful, and yet exciting read. I only regret that it's once again somewhat of a mystery novel."
1,I WANT THIS BOOK TO COUNT AS TWO!,"When Harry ""accidentally"" inflates his aunt, he gets sent away to the leaky caldron to meet with Mr. Fudge to discuss his mistake. When Hogwarts is having problems with the raving Serious Black, Harry is tracking him down for a different reason... revenge.My opinion is that this book is not great. I found it too long. I wish it would get to the point faster. I found it better than the fourth book.I would recomend this for boys, and for girls who like fantasy and adventure."
5,Best Book of the Year,"If you like reading fantasy books and you enjoy a great deal of suspense, then I highly reccommend this book. J. K. Rowling has made reading the entire Harry Potter series a most exciting adventure. I especially liked this perticular book the best, however. It is filled with intensifying mystery as well as unforgetable characters. I am fifteen and I know people of all ages who have read this book and who have also liked it just as much I have."
5,third time is a charm,"This is my third reading of the Harry Potter books and I'm even finding things I missed in the second reading. Angelina is on the quiditch team (sp) I probably spelled it wrong. Oh well, I can't wait until the fourth book comes out. I hope it has Prof. Lupin and S. Black in prominent roles. Time will tell."
1,This book is such a BAD PIECE OF WRITING,THis book was awful!! It was hard to understand the plot and the charecters seemed so bland!! No one should actually buy this book. It isnt worth the 9.98!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Did somebody fart or was that the book?,It stunk it up according to my book. I didn't even come close to getting into it. After a few school days i was falling asleep and choking on my drool. It was probably cause I saw the movie before the book and that is the only reason I gave it a 2
4,Harry Potter wins again,"This is a great book that is recommended to all readers. The best part about the book is it is enjoyable for adults and children alike. This is a book that is a must read if you have read the first two books of this series. After reading this book with it's twist and turns and suprise ending it will have you coming back for more. This book will have you questioning your thoughts at the end. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job and shows and excellent imagination. If you want to buy and book that the whole family can read then I recommend this book. The fourth book ,also in stores, will continue the third and prove to be great."
5,Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! for Ms Rowling,"I'm a 36 year old woman, young at heart and I admit that I'm a new Harry Potter fan . This was the most enchanting book that I have read in a long time. Upon reading this book, I fell in love with all the characters. It makes me wish that I went to a school like that when I was young. I bought some copies for my nieces and nephews. They really enjoyed them. One of my nephews actually received extra credit in class for bringing his to school. I also suffer from depression and this book provides stress free reading which lets me explore my new found imagination. As a Christian I don't have a problem with it either. After all it's just fantasy. We need more authors like Ms. Rowling to write books such as these so that children and adults alike can lighten up and experience the joy of youthfulness."
4,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This book is about a kid named Harry Potter who goes to a school called Hogwarts. He has brown hair, glasses, and a scar on his head. He likes to play a game called Quidditch which is played on a broom stick. A prisoner named Sirius Black escapes from prison and everyone thinks he is after Harry.I liked this book a lot. I liked about the parts about Marauder's map and the mentors. There was nothing I didn't like about this book. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5,A great read!,"I am enjoying J.K. Rowling's books about Harry Potter - I don't want the series to end with only 7 books. Maybe she'll continue to write more about Harry after the series is through.This book continues Harry's life in the magical world. In this book, Harry is force to relive some of his past. I'm not sure if his past was repressed, or if it's just brougt to life by the dementors. In either situation, Harry is forced to relive some of the worst moments of his life. Harry is beginning to learn to deal with his past and understand where he is now. He faces a figure from his past that had a lot of involvement with his parents. The books ends in a way you would never expect; just when things seem to be over, new hope is found where you would least expect it."
5,Adult reader gives 5 thumbs up.,"This series is that rarest of events: children's books that enchant readers of all ages. The plots are wonderfully conceived with plenty of twists and turns; the language is beautifully crafted showing a colorful mastery of description; the characters are multi-dimensional, almost real and quite believable; and the creatures...it's hard to find words to describe how magnificent they are. Containing enough detail, and never too much, these books will be my gift to many of my friends this holiday season."
5,Amazing!,"This book was one of the best books that I have ever read! It has lots of adventure and action. I would definitly recommend this book to people of all ages, I am 14 now and I absolutely LOVE these books and so do my friends now that I showed the Harry Potter series to them, so read it! It is worth the money!"
4,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I think it's great. I think that Harry never rests. I think that Ron never gets to rest becase he has to stop Harry.
5,The Harry Potter books are the best in the world!,"This has to be the best of all the Harry Potter books so far, and i mean it! I was so hooked i couldn't put it down! The story line is so perfectly made you wouldn't think that* * * * * * ! Don't worry i'm not going to tell you! When i started off with Harry potter and the philosophers stone, ( that's what it is called over here in ireland ) , I couldn't stop. I saved every penny of pocket money i got, for harry potter and the chamber of secrets, and finally got harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban as a gift. Now i am practilly dieing for the fourth book, it seems like century's until it comes out! But if you have nothing to read i reccomend 'Holes', by Louis Sachar, it is definitly no. two in my top ten! So all i really have to say is, Harry Potter Rocks my world!"
5,The best one yet,"I'm 11 years old, and i thought that i would be too old for harry potter books. But my sister (who's nine) convinced me to read them, and i read all three in about a week. The first one came as a shock, because it was so original, but the third one was definately the best!!!"
5,"By far, the best Harry Potter book yet!","J.K. Rowling continues to amaze me. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an excellent story! More plot twists and bizarre characters than in the first two stories, the same great characters, and all the fun from the first two books. You get a definite sense of Harry, Ron, and Hermoine maturing and growing, and a very gripping story. I can't get enough of Harry Potter!"
5,You CAN'T Put it Down!,"The Harry Potter series are one of my most favorite books. I went on a week vacation that involved a lot of driving. I started with the first book and finished the vacation with the third book, having my dad buy my the next books. The ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was my most favorite. My dad had to force me to stop reading the book! This is a must buy! I loved it!"
3,Hmmm... Kind of a disapointment.,"This book is by far the worst in the series. Not to say that it's a bad book but it's not the best. I really like Sirius and everything about Wormtail was really interesting but this book didn't reach the standards of the others by far. Again, hmmm..."
2,Review of Harry Potter Book 3,I bought this book for my 8 year old daughter but I think I enjoyed it almost as much as she did. Like the first two titles the book had a gripping plot and kept me absorbed right through from beginning to end. Recommended for adults of any age!
5,Yes!,"Awesome! This is the BEST book in the whole series! I like the history between James Potter and Sirius Black. My Favorite thing about the book is the mysteries, the suspense,and action! If you like the Percy Jackson series you'll love this!"
1,Totally Anti-Biblical and Anti-Christian!,"Christian parents beware! This is not a book you want your kids to read! It's amazing to me that Christians have been swept away by the media hype over Harry Potter and have completely overlooked the totally anti-Bible and anti-Christian perspective that the Prisoner of Azkaban was written from. I know that wizards, witches, the magical arts, astrology, necromancy, are all said to be the stuff of legends and children's fantasy. The ignorant and uninitiated say, ""No harm done!"" But I beg to differ! If you are a Christian parent and you are considering buying this book for your children, I strongly urge you to read what the Bible says about the magical arts, astrology, necromancy and the like before you let your children read this. It may seriously affect their spiritual health!"
5,Magic?,"Yeah thats right. These books don't teach violence or killing they teach loyalty and friendship and where to place your heart. Give your kids the books they are such presise and good lititure it's a oppertunity not to miss. I asked my pastor and he says it is important to believe in magic. If we didn't have magic to brighten our days life would be a bore. It is not offensive to religions. Here are some exapamples: Hermione forgiving Ron Ron worring about Hermione getting better Harry paying for his teasing the Dursleys Sirius Black trying to prove himself innocent Hermione never missing an assingment These are just some examples to how the books teach good traits. Just look around at Halloween and see all the Hermiones telling people they should be more organized and themselfs trying always trying to get good grades to be more like her. DON'T BAND OR GET RID OF J.K. ROWLING'S WONDERFUL PIECE OF ART. As Albert Einstein said,""Imagination is more important than knowledge."
5,This Is the best book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!,"This book has excitment,humor, and mystery all in one. Plus its the best out of 2 others."
4,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"As usual, it was great.This book was a stepping stone to the more difficult tasks that Harry Potter faces. It was an elaboration of Harry Potter, his past, his friends and Hogwarts. It was all about detail.Of course, there was very much a plot. Harry is once again looking in the face of danger. This time it's Sirius Black, who could have potentially been the reason his parents died. With true Harry determination, he vows to face Sirius Black if it's the last thing he does.I liked this book because it really did help me to understand the series that much better. It was a very nice read.Great insight. Be sure not miss this Harry Potter."
4,"The begining was exciting, but I did not enjoy the end.",I thought that the begining of this Harry Potter book was fun and exciting. Towards the end I found that the story was not as exciting as the past two books. Overall I will rate this book as 4 Stars.
4,Harry potter,Harry potter is a really cool book. It has a lot of action an suspense but enjoyable. Read it and have fun with Harry potter it feels like your in the book yourself. There's also some time travel so watch out here comes Hermione and her necklace.
5,"I'm your Number 1 fan, J.K. Rowling! I love the book!","Come to Elsberry.We need to have you for our author's visit. This is my favorite book I ever read. Get your fourth one out soon, I'm waiting. I didn't even like to read before I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone even though my mom's a librarian. I recommend this book to everyone. I would give this book 50 stars, if I could."
5,THe best Potter Book yet!,The Third Harry Potter book is by far the best! Rowling's plot twist's and turns so much that you won't be able to put the book down till you finish it! It'll keep you guessing till the end! This is a must read!
5,more than a just a book,"I love the magic, fighting and the three headed dog. Iexperienced this book as I read it. I loved every page of thisimaginative fantasy novel. [...]"
5,awesome book for me,I loved it! I read it 5 times already !!! I love it because Harry finds out that the fake emeny is really his god father and that he is guilty . this book is of surprises for you to find .
2,Harry Potter never stop.,Harry Potter is a great book because it makes people wonder. Is this really magic or a great authors mind? Harry Potter is an eagle who flys over the country. He never stops. Harry Potter is such a great book beacause it is like you are living inside Harry Potter. It is your world that see in his eyes. Harry Potter is good because people see the whole story. You know everything about Harry Potter's world. J.K. Rowling uses her words well.
5,Still amazing!!!!,"I thought that this book was very interesting. It's a great story in an enchanting series. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a very good book, and I will read it more than once. I recommend this to others who are interested in fantasy books."
3,Books 1 and 2 were better,"A decent yarn, but too long in view of the haphazard character development. Struck me as being written in a rush. All significant action was crammmed into the final chapters."
5,A Book to Get your Kids to Read!,"I am the mother of three children as well as a teacher. My 10 yr old son hated to read. We started reading the first Harry Potter book when it came out and he was hooked. We read a couple of chapters together whenever we could. We are still reading #2 2gether, but I read on ahead and let me tell you, #3 is the BEST! I have read it twice alone and can't wait to get to it with my son. These books have made a reader out of my son and we enjoy reading them together. The characters are wonderful and the action is addicting. All the students that I read these books with also love Harry. The Harry Potter series is a parent and teacher's dream! We just can't wait for #4. My daughters' are 4 and 7 and these books are still a little over both of their heads. But for kids 10 and up, Harry is a hit."
5,What makes Harry Potter so successful?,"It appeals to the masses. But why? Simple: it has something for everyone to enjoy. Young kids like to hear about the mystery and the cleverness of each of the characters. Older kids like it because they can identify with the problems that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have. Parents and grandparents enjoy it because it gives them something to do with their kids, and it's nice to sit back and read an enjoyable book. It simply is a recipe for success. I can't wait to read the next book! It's coming out soon!"
4,Plese read me! I'm not boring!,"This was the best book in the series. The introduction of a new carachter (Prof. Lupin) was good for the series. I chose to read this book because I wanted to give the series a second chance after reading the no so great book 2. I also liked it because it gave some answers to the questions left unanswered in books 1&2. However, it didn't really leave any questions itself. That made book 4 sort of boring. Anyway, It was the best in the series. Book 1 was a close second."
3,The Prisoner of Azkaban,It was a thrilling and exciting book. Most of the unexpected came. It was cool. It was very magical.
4,Good Book,"Though J.K. Rowling writes huge books, and this book is no exception along with the rest of the series, once you start reading it you will not want to stop. This series is so popular in fact, that they were developed into movies. The books were so action packed that the movies are just as popular as the books.The novel ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", written by J.K. Rowling, is a fiction book based on Harry Potter and his two friends at their third year at Hogwarts. While at Hogwarts, they learn of a mysterious prisoner of Azkaban that has escaped from the Azkaban jail. Harry wants to find this prison escapee and his friends join him for a wild ride. This book is very interesting, fun to read, and suspenseful. This is a great book to read and it will change the world of Harry Potter and his friends forever."
5,The Book That People Can't Put Down.,"This book was totally spellbinding; get it! I read this book in record breaking time: one day. I liked the first one and loved the second one. This book was about Harry Potter of course, getting in a lot of trouble as usual. It's about the Chamber of Secrets being opened by the Heir of Slytherin again. Get the book and read to find out who the Heir of Slytherin is."
5,The Best Series,Hi I am a 13 year old...and i read all the Harry Potter books already...this is my second time reading them! It still feels like i'm really there and can picture everything going on in the book! When i read this book i would read about 100 pages a night...i'm not known to read! Well it took me a week and half to read all three of the books....i don't think many people can say something bad about this series! If they do...they are just not using there imagination enough! Well i just have to say anyone who never read these books better do so!
5,Harry potter and the prisoner off Azkaban,I think this book was great. It's great for any age. Easy and fast reading. Very fun book to read.
5,Harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban,This is the best book ever. It's even better to read it on the kindlefire. I have read this book about 20times when I was in fourth grade.
4,Great ending,"SPOILER FREE. This is where Harry Potter starts to get slow for me. Don't get me wrong I do like the book, but I find it does slow done in the middle. For me the ending of the book was completely worth the time to get to."
5,Changed the way I work,"If you are a counselor working with teens, this will provide fresh interventions when traditional techniques have failed. It greatly improved my therapeutic skills when I worked in an inpatient teen ward. An easy Five Star book."
3,"Nice Images, Thin Paper","I really like the pictures in this coloring book but I prefer to color with markers and the pages are too thin. My prisma color markers bleed completely through the pages ruining the image on the flip side. Unless you keep them really sharp, crayons would probably be too thick to color the fine detail with any accuracy. That leaves either using sharp pencils or coping the images onto individual pieces of paper. I wish the publisher had either used thicker paper or only put images on one side of each page."
5,Perfect fit and a fair price,"It's now December of 2010 and I bought these mats back in August of 2007: I have been very satisfied with these mats but my front driver-side mat now needs to be replaced. I think this is acceptable since the car is driven virtually every day and I wear hard-soled dress shoes 5 days a week. The mats are attractive, high quality and durable but there is not a rubber ""heel pad"" on the driver's mat."
2,fabulous fanfare and little else,"I agree with most of the other reviews. The pictures are very nice-full color and glossy, but few patterns are given and the ones that are given are simple and repetitive. It's good if you want to see what tatting looks like, bad if you want to get a efficiently done book of patterns."
1,Winchester Cathedral Lawrence Welk,Unfortunately I have yet to receive this item! Actually I have not received any of the last 6 items I ordered. Help!!!!
3,"good texture, terrible odor","I'm not sure how this clay is manufactured but it has a very strong chemical or paint smell to it. Even after drying it has a fairly strong odor unpleasant enough that I took off one star. Other than that it is well mixed, color rich and has a great package. The package comes with a re-sealing tab. The plastic packaging is heavy with a foil lining that folds down well so that the clay is very well sealed after opening properly (has a dotted line to cut on)."
4,Very Important,"This book is essential for any one who works with other people, but is especially important for those who lead or guide others."
4,a pretty good mini-series,"but the all the male casts, except Liam Neeson and those older ones, were too weak and wimpy, even that devilish older brother, although with a vicious face, still looked like a wimp. the other problem we've found out was that we knew its a pretty good movie, but from the very beginning to the very end, my wife and i never shed a drop of tear or felt emotionally touched or moved by the heroine and the story. it's a fine movie but not great, because the storyline was so ordinary and had been told thousand times already.good for female viewers and should deserve a 5-star rating."
4,A Women of Substance,Great movie. I am glad I own it I saw it years ago and I am so happy I found it
4,Just shy of being great!,"Coming Up for Air was a really good book, but the first part made me think that this was just a stepping stone book for Orwell. One theme of the story was rather mediocre; unlike 1984 where Orwell had a make-believe world and told how the world had gone wrong, this book was set in the time period inbetween the wars in England, and Orwell told what was going to happen. In that way, it was rather outdated. But the book then took a shift, and it began to take a deeper meaning. These themes held the book together and made a really good book that is more than worthy of anyone's time to read it. But, nevertheless, the fact that the book seemed to foretell World War II, and everyone should be prepared made it rather old. But I do not know when Orwell wrote this book. He could have intended for it to be a warning, or he could have written in this way not realizing that the book was doomed to fail the test of time. Still, this book is really good!"
5,Orwell's best novel,"It's a shame that George Orwell's two best-known novels, ""Animal Farm"" and ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" are neither one his best novel. The peak of Orwell's fiction is this almost forgotten novel, ""Coming Up for Air."" Set in the last few years before a World War II that was obviously looming on the horizon, this elegant book memorably chronicles the life of George Bowling and his attempt to escape domesticity and the horrors to come for a few days by visiting his old home town. Every time I reread ""Coming Up for Air,"" I wonder what Orwell might have achieved if he had lived longer and had not been as ill as he was in the ten years that remained to him. If all you've read of Orwell is his two ""famous"" novels, you owe it to yourself to read this."
5,Great CD!,This is an awesome Cd. This is the best Cd that Jars of clay has come out with! I never get tired of it. =0)
2,I'm sorry but I don't like it that much,"I'm sorry, but this album doesn't do that much for me. I love Much Afraid so I decided to finally buy this album. I personally only like the songs ""Liquid"" and ""Flood"" quite a bit, and then ""Art in Me"", ""He"" and ""Blind"" are ok. ""Love Song for a Saviour"" is too repitive, and the rest of the songs aren't that great.However, many people won't agree with me. To be honest, this album is too acoustic and folkish for me. Not being a fan of folk music, I don't like this album that much. I much prefer the more pop/rock flavour to Much Afraid and Jars of Clay's great new release, ""The Eleventh Hour"".If you love folk music or acoustic rock you should like this album. I must admit the instrumentation is really interesting, especially on ""Boy on a String"". This album is definitely unique; it's just not my style."
5,Wonderful!,"Definately the best Jars of Clay cd. All the songs are good. i lost my copy so i am replacing it, it's that good! don't hesitate. :)"
2,overrated,"First off, Flood is a killer song. That out of the way, the rest of the album is barely tolerable. The drum machines, redundant guitar strumming, and annoying samples make up an album that doesn't live up to its hype. One hopes that Jars will eventually record an entire album with Adrian Belew, the only producer who's been able to do anything at all interesting with their sound."
2,"Too long, too drawn out","This is the first book by this author that I have read, and it will be the last, regardless of the other reviewer's comments. Reading this book was a total waste of time. Indeed, toward the end of the book, I just simply quit. I agree with another reviewer. I didn't care about any of the characters enough to finish this this long winded tome. I continued to read the book in hopes that I would eventually become interested or caught up in the story, but it never happened, and in fact, the story and characters just became more annoying and aggravating with every page.There are so many other great books out there that a reader does not have to waste days on end reading this book that doesn't provide any excitement or suspense to hook the reader."
2,Decent but not for serious Ping Pong players...,"The table has good bounce. The painting isn't as bad as some people claimed (the peel-off problem has apparently been fixed) on the net, and it is really easy to stow. However, my biggest gripe is with the gap between the two half-tables: in my case, it's a bit more than 7/8"". I called the support line and was told this is by design, though the gap should be 1/2"". Without it, you won't be able to pull the tables up.I just happen to think that's a very bad design which makes the table not regulation size, looks weird and all. I'm seriously thinking about returning it."
5,Excellent Product - Its a better Design and Does Not Look Like the Picture,"Just got this today and arrived in a seriously solid box - well protected and well packed. Took less than 5 minutes to install on my bike with the MC Enterprises Sissy Bar already installed. Remove the two rear sissy bar screws, removed the one back seat screw, lined this up, and put the screws back in.FYI... it was also delivered with longer screws if needed and larger spacers for installs without the sissy bar.It's bigger than it looked and I was impressed at how well it fit and looks. Solid and doesn't move.It does not look exactly like the picture shown by the seller - it has a piece that runs up the middle that attaches to fender through the hole at the back of the seat. I'll upload a pic soon but it's a perfect match to the Mean Streak."
4,An Old Friend Returns,"I haven't heard ""Thirty Seconds Over Winterland"" in years. I'm very glad to finally have this recording again. Although ""Bless Its Pointed Little Head"" is the best live Airplane album, ""Thirty Seconds"" is essential. My favorite tracks are ""Have You Seen The Saucers"" and the extended jam version of ""Feel So Good"". Love Jack Casady's bass solo on this! The bonus tracks are worthy of being here! The CD itself replicates their Grunt Records label nicely. After years of missing this album, it's like the return of an old friend!"
4,great comparisons,"Penglase is one of the leading experts on Greek and Mesopotamian mythology and any influence that may have occured between the two. He promotes what I would call ""big theme"" influences, not tiny details that strip each culture of its own creativity. A bit confusing at times, it is well worth the time of myth speicalists."
1,Disappointed,I agree with the other person who gave this book one star. This book reminded me of SQL books online. If you go to each screen and click on Help it will give you the same information as what's in this book - nothing else. I was disappointed that the author didn't go into detail as to what options are the best to choose - that's what I am looking for.
3,"OK guide, but much information available elsewhere.","The book is okay for people who haven't booked a cruise before, but I found that much of the information they offer as an ""unofficial guide"" may be found at various discussion sites that are easily found through a web search."
5,Very informative and easy to read. Good details.,This book had good details about the various ships cruising in the Carribean. It gives details about ports of call and pricing that other books don't include. I especially appreciated his detailed rating system since you can't use the star rating system anymore. He compared each ship line and individual ship thoroughly.
5,80s THRASH!!!,"This is toltal 80s thrash. The first track is kind of weak and you can hardly hear the vocals but the rest of the album is just total thrash metal all the way. This is for fans of Megadeth, D.R.I., Slayer, Metallica, Anthrax, Suicidal Tendencies, Wehrmacht, Crumbsuckers, Ludichrist, Nuclear Assault, Deathrow, The Accused, Death Angel, Spazztic Blurr, Heathen, D.B.C., C.O.C., A.O.D., Witches Hammer, Forbidden... Yadda yadda yadda, you get the point. Just buy it right now."
2,Disappointing in so many ways,"I am a bit of a memoir ""junkie"" and upon reading the reviews here and elsewhere was greatly anticipating a wonderful story. I was hopeful as Mr. Lawford began his tale, I would up extremely disappointed and actually, a bit repulsed. While the writing was not bad, I certainly did not find it to be of extremely high quality. As others have said I found it a bit repetitious and extremely self-indulgent. The final blow is the unbelievably narcissistic rationalization for the ending of his marriage. At the end of the day, it turns out that Mr. Lawford is simply another Kennedy womanizer. In his case, however, he uses his addiction as a sort of rationalization for its demise. My heart aches for the children of this marriage who have to contend with, not only a divorce, but an adolescent-like narcissitic father as well."
5,great book,My grandmother is reading this book next. What a great view and just made you see a different side to Chris and his family
3,"Alcoholic Drama, Sad but true!","I wish this was better written; it needs some editing. This said, it was still a heart-wrenching and moving story of loss, confusion and the times we grew up in. It is a pretty miserable childhood that Mr. Lawford endured...no one was there to guide him. There are huge gaps in the story, and too many references to the most beautiful women in the world. It is time he grew up and got over it! I recommend this book for all the recovering alcoholics I know, and I know a lot! It is a sad state of affairs when you are surrounded by so many sick drug induced lives. Our parents often forgot to tell us the important things to be successful. I especially enjoyed his reference to Tufts University (where I also attended) and the part about how he blew off Meredith Vierra and ""forgot"" to call her. Some beautiful women were just too smart for him, I guess."
3,Symptoms of Withdrawal,"Insightful recollections of a tragic life of a Kennedy offspring. It's an amazing story of survival and detachment from the reality of the masses. Entitlement to a peaceful ,sane existence isn't necessarily passed on in the name one inherits."
2,Unedited Manuscript Sees Print!,"Unfortunately I have become used to typos in books. Although this was a rare occurrence 20 years ago almost every new book has a few. But this Lawford book has at least one error per page. Not just spelling, grammatical, and continuity errors but also chronological, factual, and historical. Chris goes to a jewelry store to buy a ""bobble."" Do you think he meant bauble? He mentions a cat with a ""gastronomical"" disorder when he clearly means gastrointestinal. Was there any editing done at all? Or did the publishers just rush to print with yet another Kennedy book? And there were way too many glimpses of Jackie in the bathroom. Chris, please show some restraint and have some respect for the dead. The addiction/""recovery"" story is old news but having a few Kennedy connections will always sell a book, no matter how badly written."
2,Replacing One Addiction With Another,"What's amazing to me most about this book is that Chris Lawford seems merely to have transferred his intense need to blot out the ""pain"" of his existence from using drugs to ""using"" drugs. After any number of failed careers and relationships, now he's decided that saving others from addiction is his new meal ticket...oh, excuse me...calling in life. What rings out loud and clear in his writing, however, is that Lawford is still the same, shallow narcissist he's always been, and that even in his 50s, he seems to be immune to any of life's lessons. Lucky for him the Kennedy family coffers are always there to pick up the pieces.Aside from that, the book is poorly written and edited. I can't imagine Norman Mailer's reasons for claiming that Lawford was a good writer, but it must have been payback for something, because he's not."
4,Wonderfully Honest,"Anyone who has experienced addiction in their family will be enthralled by the honesty in this memoir. It takes real courage to own up to all the harm one does to others when addicted, and also, to accept blame for your own condition. I found this book sad, funny, depressing, uplifting, all at once. I recommend it highly."
5,Best Album Ever Made!,"Although I haven't heard this album yet, and in fact haven't ever heard of this Mystikal character before, this cd has received so many rave reviews here that it's just GOT TO BE great!!! Without a doubt, it contains the greatest music ever written. I urge you to buy this amazing cd. You won't be disappointed, I promise."
4,Great album,"One of my favorite albums by R. This is when we had to realize, ""this brother is talented!!!!"" This album was good because he had some of his love songs on it, then the songs to make you groove, and threw in some spirtual songs to round it off. There is something for everyone on this CD.My favorite cuts on this CD:2. Hump Bounce - nice litte groove6. Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby7. You to be Happy8. Down Low - the relationship between he and Isley was born9. I can't sleep baby14.Temp Slow16. Trade in My life - he was testifying on this song!!!The whole album is good, but the songs I listed are the songs I play the most."
5,Fun times,"This season was full of laughs but one thing I want to know is who did her hair and thought that looked remotely nice. She looks like she put her finger in an electric socket. However, the episodes were very different from the first season and this one had a bunch of new scenery in Europe."
5,MORE!,I agree with the other reviews - I can't wait for the remaining seasons. Please release them soon!
2,"light-weight and ""primitive"" but entertaining.","I remember them from when they were on but my wife had not seen them (we weren't married then). We got Season One and found them primitive in story and writing and believablity, but they were nice when simple diversion was desired. The Second Season is more interesting in the European location photography, and the costumes a little less tacky. But the stories are still a welcome occasional diversion."
1,"Would rate as a 5 star, if the season was released!","Love Scarecrow & Mrs. King, but it's been 8 months since season 1 was released! To Warner Brothers, why release season 1, if the following seasons were not going to be released in a timely manner? It's annoying! To Amazon - I understand why seasons 2-4 are listed, so we can sign up for updates if the seasons are released, but if Warner Brothers does not indicate the seasons will be released, take the reference to the seasons off the site or pressure Warner Brothers to release them already."
5,Excellent record of Korngold's film music,"This album contains musical suites from seven of Korngold's film scores: Elizabeth & Essex, the Prince & the Pauper, Anthony Adverse, Sea Wolf, Deception, Another Dawn, and Of Human Bondage. All exceptionally performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Charles Gerhardt. While the diehard Korngold fan will definately want to explore the complete scores of these films, this disc along with ""The Sea Hawk"" provides a good overview of some of the finest music ever written for the screen."
1,Simon Posford has gone 8 clouds beyond this,"Perhaps this might have been considered good when it came out, and when most of these reviews were written, about 11 years ago. However, this is nothing compared to the later work of Simon Posford (the force behind Hallucinogen, Younger Brother, and Shpongle). This one and ""The Lone Deranger"" are quite repetitive... one dance beat repeats all the way through most of the songs. Simon is just getting the knack of his synthesizers on these early works. I only kept one song from these 2 albums on my music player... and even it isn't a standout. ""In Dub"" by Hallucinogen, on the other hand, is much much better, as it was produced years later, and is slower paced, trippier dub. In fact, ""In Dub"" ranks very high on Simon's discography imo. Afficionados of Simon's later work can forget about the two sophomoric Hallucinogens."
2,poorly edited,"This book has a ton of typographical errors. This book and the Arco book appear to be the only 2 books available as study guides for the AFOQT. After buying and studying from both books, I am not surprised the Air Force recommends studying from other guides like SAT, ACT, GRE, etc. The explanations are poor also. I've been studying from these books and bought other guides and have basically been using the other guides to find explanations for similar questions that I do not understand."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this book for ASTB and was sorely disappointed. It was like someone told them the general areas the ASTB covered and they made up their own questions. It wants you to learn things that will never show up on the ASTB and then proceeds to not even mention large sections of the ASTB like the spatial reasoning portion or the Aviation and Nautical Information portion. Even ignoring these elements, the fact that the book has numerous errors made me throw mine away in disgust."
5,"great book, informative","i'm new to online investing and I was looking for a basic, well-organized, clearly presented book to help get me started. In truth I've bought about five books on the subject and I liked this one best. Great, clear, informative. Just what you need without the junk. I recommend it."
4,Get a Hold on Hip Hip,"I believe this was the last true Tribe album. The Love Movement didn't exactly seem like the way they should go out to me. This album reminds me of high school and being down the shore. I can't even explain to you the way I used to zone out to ""Get a Hold"", an overlooked track on this album. The rhymes are slick, as is to be expected from Q and Phife - and the tracks are all soulful and creatively constructed. 1nce Again was the single off this album and it really captured the Tribe sound as it had developed over time.A solid effort from one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time."
3,Bally Who?,"Not bad - but there is some better on the issue out there. Like most of the creators DVD's, I struggle with the over dramatic ""ballyhoo"" showmanship effects they tend to employee - overpowers actual investigative information. I really suggest a rental first or, see of there is a cheaper download to self-burn the DVD if you have that ablility. They get points for heavy dramatics and DVD graphics effects - but it tends to come off like a ""Haunted House"" effect - playing for flash and scares versus focus on the topic -- and the pizza guy? (special features)"
3,Not A Documentary,"I haven't seen the film but I know and worked with Mark Opsasnick who wrote the REAL story about the Haunted Boy (and yeah, the whole Exorcist thing was a hoax).Read the REAL story here:[...]The Real Story Behind the Exorcist: A Study of the Haunted Boy and Other True-Life Horror Legends from Around the Nation's CapitalAnd if you liked the movie that's being discussed here, that's fine. Just be aware that it ain't a true story."
4,Dragnet [Original Soundtrack] Audio CD,"What you see is what you get. All songs from the movie except the film's version of the opening credits. The Art Of Noise track has something similar, but doesn't have Dan Aykroyd's Joe Friday saying ""Ju-Ju-Ju-Just the facts, Ma'am"" as he does in the film. Most of the other tracks are score from the film, but Aykroyd and Hanks' ""City of Crime"" is a great addition to anyone's music collection and is difficult to find anywhere else. The Walter Schumann Dragnet March, Danger Ahead and closing credits have never sounded better. All in all, a great CD but it's a real shame the film's opening credit sequence is missing/changed.-joe"
3,Pricey,My son uses this product and swears by it. However we buy it for under $6 from Walgreens.com & that is for the same 12oz bottle
5,Great Book!,This book is not only full of great advice on how a real relationship should start off and work good for the long term relationship but its also very entertaining so it keeps you amused while your learning!
1,not good,this car mount lacks a pin to fit into your telescope. it therefore moves on the base. you can tighten all you want and it still moves
5,Stress Management for DUMMIES,"This is an awesome book, everyone should read this! It sure has helped to eliminate alot of unneeded stress in my life!"
5,perfect back up protection,This product is sitting in storage waiting for use. We have used the projector as directed and have not had need for the bulb yet.
3,The Home Maker,"When I recieved the book. it was damaged. I bought it new so that I would not recieve a beat up book but I guess something happened in the process of shipping, etc. that it got damaged. Other than that it was in good shape."
4,Who would not love a book like this,"The discovery of the new world is one of the most exciting periods to study. Here is a book that has not only has Drake, Magellan, and Columbus but has the story of less famous mariners as well. This is not a book that has to be read all at once. You can read about one of the explorers and when you are sick of reading about storms and starvation put it aside for awhile."
2,There's a dark side to this book...,"The book is well written and seemingly convincing. But I recommend that the book be read with an open mind and not be taken as matter of fact. My wife and I both read it. I thought it was interesting, she thought it was superb. She's since left me to for the man you suggested the book. She thinks this is her ""soulmate"". Perhaps so, but 20 years of marriage and four small children is a lot to give up for an author who's working on theory. Be careful!"
3,Bushnell Binocular Tripod Adaptor,"As other reviews I read stated the binocular mounting threads were cut inaccurately, mine was the same even though part was made for my model. It was no big deal re-cutting the threads, as I have the tools to do this. Adaptor now works just fine, but if someone buys this and doesn't have access to a tap and die set, it would be an ""irritating issue""."
3,ok for the price,"It supports my bushnell natureview roof prisim binocluars very well. However the design of the binocular leaves very little space to screw or unscrew the adapter, so attaching and removing it, is bit of a hassle"
3,This is what I wanted BUT.....,"This item is what I wanted to connect my newly purchased (from Amazon) binoculars to my tripod. Problem was the threads on the adaptor were not well made or not checked by a quality control person. BUT (again)a fellow in my office has a die set and was able to clean up the threads and the adaptor, now, works perfectly. I don't like sending things back and was glad to ""fix it up"" so it would work but this should not be."
2,Outfield's worst moment,"It just amazes me how the band needed so many years to record their worst album. Yes, the longest, but the worst. If features a GREAT song (Heaven's little angel""). And the rest are pretty much fillers.The most surprising thing is that the production sounds totally unprofessional, with flat sound, totally punch-less, songs that are over before the fade out is done..."
3,Textbook used for quantitative methods,"This textbook did explain the basics very well. Unfortunately, the formulas we were asked to use were different than the textbook required for this class. That made the book harder to learn from."
4,Holocaust,"""This Way for the Gas"" is a frank, sometimes raw telling of stories from the extermination camps of Hitler. It taps into the deep horror and black comedy of life pushed to the limits by brutality. I would not use it with children or young teens."
5,John Coletrane of the Jazz Organ,"This is one of Big John Patton's best recordings. It stretches out in a Larry Young-esque sense of the word, however, one must note that it was Big John who kinda broke the sound barrior and set the stage for Larry. John's playing is very straight ahead and earthy, the grooves both hypnotic and highly danceable, yet at the same time ""off center"" (hence John Zorn's attraction to him in the '90s) - - Lite Hit and Along Came John are faves. After you listen to this one, go out and get either his more recent BLUE PLANET MAN or his Grant Green classic BLUES FOR LOU. The good news... John is amidst a comeback... he's playing and composing again, so call your local club and ask them when he's coming your way. John is also featured prominantly on the new Blue Note Picture calander."
2,"Horrible, manufactured, cliche pop.","I can't believe I actually liked these guys when they first came out. This CD is full of really bad pop songs, most of which have boring lyrics, bad programming and annoying vocals. I have given this album a chance, and they failed. Nothing like some other GOOD pop albums I own.PS: Sorry guys. At least I didn't give it one star!"
1,THIS IS MUSIC ?,"I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THIS CD SELLS , IT JUST PROVES THAT LOOKS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAT TALENT AND MATERIAL WHEN IT COMES TO POP MUSIC. P.S. I REALLY MEANT TO PUT ZERO STARS."
4,Great if you like pop,"I love this cd. i used to listen to it everyday(sometimes more than once). but i have to say that their second U.S. album ""Millenium"" is much better. in ""millenium"" the boys have matured and even written some of the songs themselves. ""the perfect fan"" is and example. it was written by brian littrell, for his mother. how sweet is that? so sweet and touching that he was almost in tears while singing it live at a concert. anyways, ""backstreet boys"" is a great album. yes, there are some songs that aren't that great, (if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy comes to mind) but i have never heard of a cd were you like all the songs. on all of my cd's i hate at least one song. usually more. so i suggest to anyone who likes pop music that you get this album."
5,OMG!,I LOVE them. There music takes my breath away. I have all of their CD's. They are SO CUTE and awsome. I LOVE them. A must buy for any backstreet boys fan!
3,It depends on what you like...,"This is a pretty good cd. It has its slow love songs and its fast dance songs. If you don't like slow, sappy songs like me, DON'T buy it because it's full of them like their newest one, Millenium. The best songs are: Everybody, Quit Playing Games, As Long As You Love Me, and Get Down. The worst songs are: Set Adrift On Memory Bliss, Darlin', and Anywhere For You. Basically this is an ok cd, but certainly not the best."
4,A classic party/dance-pop album,"The Backstreet Boys' debut album, a compilation of the hits from their previous two releases, presents itself as an power-packed pop smash. This album is filled with irrasistibly fun, catchy dance tracks such as ""We've Got It Goin' On,"" ""Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"" and ""Get Down (You're The One For Me.)"" The album is also buffered with several saccharine ballads, the best of which are ""As Long As You Love Me"" and ""All I Have To Give."" Some songs seem overpackaged, like ""Anywhere For You,"" some are almost unbearably so, like ""Darlin'"" and a ghastly cover of PM Dawns' ""Set Adrift On Memory Bliss."" Although detractors of pop music will loathe this album (mind you, for no real reason,) afficiandos of pop and teen-dance will find this album to be a must-have."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG!!,"THIS CD IS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST PLEASE DO NOT GET IT .IF YOU YOU DO YOU'LL BE SORRY.IF YOU THINK THOSE BOY'S ARE SEXY, THINK AGAIN .YOU ALREADY HAVE A BOY FREIND THAT LOVES YOU THE BACKSTEET BOYS DONT KNOW YOU AT ALL.SO GET ON WITH IT."
5,BSB ARE #1!!!!!!!!!,"The Backstreet Boys are soooo talented. They please everyone with their music. How can all the little boys say that these five fine guys are not good singers. they are the best. So, Keep the BSB Pride Alive!!!!! Go Nick, Brian, AJ, Kevin, and Howie..you rule!!!!!!"
2,Thank god they are no More,"The Only Reason I gave this C.D a chance was because my Girlfriend Happens to love these Moronic disgraces of Music. 4 songs on this 12 song album were Decent! the rest Were shoddy Production and too Poppy. ""quit Playing Games with my heart"" a great song has an rnB feel to it. ""As long as you love me"" Great Lyrics and the groove is catchy!. ""all i have to give"" fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it. ""everybody"" the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many times i have the lyrics imbedded in my brain. The rest suck. Im sorry But after Artist like ""Prince"", ""Stevie Wonder"" , ""Michael Jackson"" Paved the way for these young swill Merchants. You think Anyone Would make good music. Well These Puppets for the record companies Suck no Punn intended. if you like this kind of music go listen to Savage Garden at least they have Talent. these morons don't and Im out!"
2,It's a good CD,"They have a lot of talent, but seem to use it in a way that doesn't use it all. They could put a little more workin the CD. It is annoying how all these girls go ga-ga over them just because of thier looks. Nick should cut his hair because its to long. AJ should keep his hair the normal color. Brain's face looks too boney. I think that they shouldn't try to make their fans like them because of their looks. I hope they're more people who think the same way I do. Thanks for listening to me!"
1,Hah...,"What was so appealing about these guys? Its 5 guys singing s***ty love songs (that they did not write themselves by the way) overtop of synthesizers and processed beats (that they also didn't arrange). Theres no talent there. Playing instruments, writing songs and peicing together songs takes talent. The worst part of it? They were likely inspired by New Kids On The Block, who were also horrible and completely put together by their record label (they even admitted they couldn't sing for crying out loud...). I cant wait to hear what a disaster the record their recording right now will be..."
5,This is the book!,"I have bought several different training books but this is the only one that really explains in detail everything you need to know. I live in Europe and there is no way I'll find a western trainer in my area, so I really needed advice, and this book gives it. Very helpful, from what you need in bits, bridles, saddles, spurs, and why, and how to best select it all for you and your horses. Then light handed horsemanship from the very beginning, from the first the minutes of meeting a colt at birth, all the way to how to teaching him to side step, it is all in there. Excellent!"
1,An Ugly Transplant of Misconception,"I wouldn't describe it as enlightened behaviour. But, in summary, the invasion has been an abject failure.This transplant of flotsam and jetsam - that they presume to call a culture - is merely an unwelcome transplant wallowing in a miasma of its own making and irrelevance.Wouldn't it be great if it had been the Aboriginals who started all those bushfires.That awful little syncophant, Howard, would indignantly call them terrorists, I'm sure."
3,Interference problem.,"I love the way this product works. It was easy to install, and the lasers are much better parking guides than the wooden beams we kept tripping over on the garage floor. HOWEVER, the transformer for the lasers generates enough radio interference that the garage door opener doesn't always respond to our remotes when the lasers are on. We replaced our old opener, and called in the service people for the new opener, before we figured out what was going on. Now I have the transformer plugged into an extension cord, so that it's about two feet from the garage door opener, and everything works fine."
4,Excellent Parking Aid,"Mounted this a couple of months ago on the ceiling in our double garage. It was easy to install except it didn't come with drywall anchors and the position I place it in behind the garage door opener there were no ceiling joists to anchor it to. I found that I needed to position the cars in the garage in their ideal positions and then focus the laser on a spot on the dash. Then I had to teach all the drivers in the house what point they were aiming for. Since then it has worked perfectly. It feels like we have more room in the garage now. The only down side is the laser is triggered by motion and anytime you walk through the garage, the laser goes off. It times out in several seconds so it doesn't seem to be a big problem and this is a low power device. I'm now going to order the single laser for the 3rd car."
5,excellent book,"I own about a dozen books on herbal medicine and I keep finding myself back to this one time and time again. It is well written with a ton of useful information ranging from uses,terminology, cautions, and best ways to use the herbs. A must have for anyone interested in herbal medicine"
1,Doesn't work,"Has a lot of fancy print. Many reviews that they probably wrote themselves. This product is alcohol , water, and menthol. Doesn't do anything for an itch."
3,Weak but not worthless,"After 3 straight out consistantly funky albums, Gettin It is the start of the steep downhill spiral of Short Dog. All hes post retirement releases since are complete crap, replacing funk for commercial spastic beats. However there are some awesome grooves on this album but I think you could cut it down to about 6 tracks. The first 3 hit the spot. The opener is a nice placid jam with a good melodic hook that saves it from becoming a bit to monotonous. Track 2 and 3 are typically groove orientated Ant Banks jams that are worth every cent. Track 4 stinks before the smooth **** my car. There are a couple of so so tracks till the albums end there after but in general your not missing to much if you switch the CD off after track 5. This release was a tired production and after hearing the absolute garbage after hes retirement, he should have stayed there"
4,Pretty Solid,I'd say from all of his pre-retirement albums this is about #5. I'd def. go with the pre '96 albums from Short Dog as he is the representation of the old school funk. So get this album it is still pretty dope
5,Excellent all around,Very impressed with the thickness of this product. Compares to Nordicware but not the price. The handles are an added feature that I have not seen with other manufacturers.
4,Por Peteneras!,"This spelling Spanish musical genre has fascinated and even captivated generations and generations. The mystery, the enervating energetic flow, the visible sensuality, the suggesting figures and fascinating bewitch seem to nestle in your spirit once you have listened.Montoya 's playing is filled of imagination and elegant phrasing, he plays flourish on the guitar with nuance and far to make fireworks with his instruments, he builds sonorities.Go for this album and get close to the world of Carlos Montoya. You won't believe it."
5,Love it!,I was nervous about it fitting my microwave but couldn't afford to replace the whole oven. It is a different brand than my oven but it fits well and works beautifully.
5,Tray fits Emerson microwave from WalMart,"Yay! Took a chance hoping this would fit my Emerson microwave from WalMart (just measure your old tray for right diameter). It fits perfectly, both in the center and aligning with the roller guides! Great price (I shopped, others started at twice the price delivered), excellent very quick well-packed delivery. Didn't have to buy a new microwave, and saved space in the landfill! YAY! :-)"
1,bad information,Product not described enough that is a replacement tray for a microwave not a plate to cook on microwave ovens alredy have one in them now we have an extra tray that we have no use for we wasted our money for nothing you need tyo describe it more
2,Barnes' worst effort,"This album was on hell of a letdown, especially after the great ""Warpath"" album. Replacing Allen West with former Massacre guitarist Steve Swanson was a terrible move, as was letting mediocre bassist Terry Butler write songs. Many of the songs are done in early 90's Massacre style (which is boring as hell, second rate death metal). There are about 3, maybe 4 good songs on here plus a couple of halfway decent covers. Uninspired guitar riffing for the most part fill this album. The vocals are pretty good however. I think Barnes should have stuck with the uniqueness of his previous album. He is trying to go back to a ""brutal"" death metal sound which falls miles short from recent releases from Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Krisium, Morbid Angel, and the such."
4,"Its good, but not great","In Love and Death tetters on the line of good and great. Songs like ""I cought Fire"", ""Let it bleed"", ""All that I've got"" and ""I'm a Fake"", are realy what make this album stand out. Now this is not a knock on any of the other songs, but The Used seems to deviate from the sound that made them so popular in the first place. ""Yesterday's feelings"", ""Hard to Say"" and ""Cut up Angels"" are good songs, but they dont do much to seperate The Used from the rest of the bands in the same genre. In the end, everyone should appreciate this record, but unlike their first album, In Love and Death is realy good, but not great."
2,"Wow, this CD sucks......","I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm getting sick and tired of follow-up let downs. Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, Flaw, and now The Used all come to mind. Who are the record lable fools causing this to happen? Why try to mold your sound into wimpy MTV ""Yellowcard"" cookie cutter waste. I have tried to give this CD several listens in an effort to let it grow on me. Didn't work. I do not recommend this CD if you are tired of being let down."
3,"Ok, but not really","So at first i thought this was the crappiest album ever made, and especially cause the used's first was so good. But i gave it a chance anyways, and some songs grew on me. But still, this album has definatly lost alot of intensity...Burt's sweat death screams have all but disapered, most of the song layouts are generic, and some of the lyrics and song chorus's are simply crap. For the oldschool fan's, youll like the songs Take it away, Let it Bleed, Sound Effects And Overdramatics, and I'm a Fake. For those of you who like some softer watered down music--you'll appreciate the rest."
3,In Love And Death,"Well I personally didn't like the first Used album too much. This one on the other hand is a pretty good disc. I will say that there isn't as much screaming on this record and that really does the music well. Most of the songs are good and have some good melodies. My biggest complaint is the basic song structure thru out the entire album. Which really its what most music is. They display alot of the soft/loud type dynamics that just about every band on the planet has done in the past and just like most bands will do in the future. My biggest like of the album is the overall guitar sound on this album. The production really did the guitars justice and Quinn really puts together some nice textures that compliment the songs. A couple songs have really bland riffs. But still the overall ""sound"" is really good."
2,One Good song.,"And that's ""All That I've Got,"" which makes this whole cd whorth 2 stars becuase the song and the music video are just so good. But overall, the lead singer's voice sounds whiny and annoying. If you like the song ""I'm A Fake,"" then I'd reccomend From First To Last, who sounds similar, but is much better than The Used. If you are thinking about buying this cd, save yourself $7.50 and just buy ""All That I've Got"" off of iTunes because it's really the only decent song on here. If you're a new fan of The Used, stick to their old stuff and listen to ""Buried Myslef Alive."""
4,Surprisingly Good!,"The Used is a totally rad band. Unfortunately, i do not own any of their cds... BUT i have listened to both their cds all the way through (well... almost). Needless to say, their first album was better, but IN LOVE & DEATH is actually pretty good. I think they could of done a little better. The first three tracks are pretty good, but tracks 4 and 5 are horrible! They were so bad and just skipped them because they're rather annoying songs. The next tracks are ok, but they kind of odd. Just the tune of the songs, i guess. then there's track 9, the best song on the whole cd with heavy guitars and screaming. Totally rad! the last three tracks are pretty good, no complaints. Overall, a pretty good follow-up to their first album, but it could have been improved. If you wanna get this album go ahead. Either you like it or totally hate it."
1,"This CD is really, really bad... really.","The only thing more depressing than listening to Bert's make-believe phoney suicidal ramblings, is the fact that Bert still hasn't committed suicide. Because then this album would have never been released; saving every asinine 17 year old teenager from forcing themselves to like it so they can tell everyone at school about how killer the new Used CD is. How edgy! Do yourself a favor, download I Caught Fire, All I Got, and Light With A Sharpened Edge, because they're the only tolerable songs on this album. It really sucks, really."
1,Dont Buy This!,"Seriously, i used to be the worlds biggest USED fan, loved their debut and everything. But their sophomore album, this In Love And Death stuff is HORRIBLE. 90 percent of it sounds like they wrote it specifically for 12 year old good charlotte fans. One song, ""Im A Fake"", starts out with Bert saying a corny spoken word poem about cutting, ""Im cutting trying to picture your black broken heart, love is not like anything, especially a ____ knife"". CORNY. The only good song is probably ""Soundeffects and overdramatics"", which features the singer from Coalesce. Save yourself the money, just go download soundeffects on itunes for a buck..."
1,Don't waste your parents money.,I wouldn't give this to Toys for Tots.It's as simple as this.I've seen them live.I've listened to both albums.I'm not giving this band a shot anymore.
1,Ew! The Used! Get it off me!,"It's not that I don't like this cd because it's emo. I don't like it because its bad. I like the first track and thats it. If you're gonna get emo crap, get GOOD emo crap, like the new MCR album. Unless, that is, you want to hear songs titled 'Cut up angels' and 'I'm a fake.'You have been warned."
1,Very confusing,"Too much math.. drawings/charts/etc. are not proper... very confusing...only three colours... black, white, blue...just bores u to death"
1,Poor for Beginners,"As a first time learner of Signals and Systems, this is a very poor book. Examples can be confusing, and the web portion of the book is dated. Hopefully you don't get this book asigned..."
1,Rip-off,"Ok I 'm pissed, they gave it too many in a sleeve that was obviously a poor, grainy reprint of the album cover of the cd I was expecting. The cd looked like an obvious rip-off. I don't suggest buying from this seller."
5,This series is addictive. Keep'em coming.,"Darn you Tim and Jerry, I want more. I foud that this book was a little repetative in sections, only because I read this book as soon as I was done with ""The Tribulation Force"" Keep'em coming!!!!"
4,total excitement!,"this is by far the best of the first 3 books in this series thus far. without giving anything away, the ""edge of your seat"" escape as well as the ending have hooked me completely. im so happy that i didnt give up on this series. if you are reading this as someone who has yet to begin the series, stick with it...it will be worth it. the writing of the 3rd book is a huge improvement over the first 2 and i eagerly await the next installment (which is being passed around the office...thank god im next, or i'd have to go buy a copy for myself!)one more thing....i myself am not a religious person and i know a lot of people who arent religious are reading these books. i am reading this series for entertainment value and in this 3rd book, i am completely entertained!"
2,Worst of the 3 book series,"Disappointing. Loved the first 2 books, but this one seemed like the authors rushed it out to meet a deadline or something. Could've used more thought & originality. Certainly still worth reading, but don't expect the quality of the first 2, which were phenomenally good."
1,More Sheep Fodder!,Why God or Satan would want anything to do with our planet or it's people is beyond me. More Christian (sheep fodder) propaganda masquerading as entertainment to frighten the mental Pygmies into believeing this stuff is true...get a life.
5,A great read! Recommend reading the series in order though.,"This is a thought provoking series that makes both Christians and non-christian think about their lives and what will be eternal and what is going to be ""left behind"" Highly recommended"
2,"Finally, a Christian novel that won't insult your IQ","Why do they always have to make it seem simple? Why are the chareacters always so boring? Why do they always make it seem like morality suddenly becomes black and white? Why do they always seem like they are written for fifth graders? Why areChristian novels so BAD? If y6ou've asked yourself these questions, buy We All Fall Down. Smart, funny, and totally engrossing, this is the best novel about Christianity that I've ever read."
4,A book and a series that I could not put down!,"Nicolae Carpathia is a man moving to world power. The thirdbook in the Left Behind series follows the previous with charactersand points. This book, along with the others in the series, is a must read for our times. For anyone searching for answers, this book can set you on the right path. Well-written, with good biblical references, it was a joy to read!"
4,"Works right into it's sequel, Soul Harvest.","Despite the few nay-sayers of LaHaye & Jenkins' writings of the Left Behind series, I must give it my stamp of approval. The content on the antichrist is enough to make anyone straighten up and fly right, before it's too late. In this sequel to Tribulation Force, after being ""Left Behind"", the characters now find themselves clinging to the word of God so they are not fooled into accepting the antichrist."
3,Good enough,"Compared with the previous 2 books, this one is a little repetitive. For people who didnt read Left Behind and Tribulation Force, it is ok... But in my case, I read bith in the same month... But, after all, is a good history..."
4,Suspensefull,"Like the first two books, it was suspenseful and unpredictable. Anyone interested in biblical stories will find this book very helpful ,knowelgable and resourceful."
4,NICOLAE,EXCELLENT EXPLAINATION OF THE BOOK OF REVALTIONS PUT INTO MODERN DAY TERMS .. THIS BOOK HAS THE STORY OF THE CHARACTER DESCRIBED AS THE ANTICHRIST IN THE BIBLE. MUST READ THE ENTIRE LEFT BEHIND SERIES IN ORDER TO GET THE FULL AND COMPLETE STORY.. I FOUND THEM TO BE GREAT READING. ESPECIALLY IF ONE LOVES THRILLERS. THESE BOOKS HAVE ABOUT EVERYTHING ANYONE COULD WANT IN THEM.
5,Profound,"How wonderful to get involved in reading a series where each succeeding book is better than the one before. This has held true so far in the ""Left Behind"" series. Much of the dialogue in the third book, ""Nicolae"" is downright profound. As the personality and agenda of the Antichrist is revealed to have overtones of Hitler's reign, the narrative turns almost scary. The authors talent abounds in this third fast-paced page turning novel. The insight into the ""end days prophecy"" is not only thought inspiring at times it rings with such reality it is totally mind-boggling. A well written captivating series..."
4,Very enjoyable,"The Left Behind series has been very interesting, the character are strong and keeps you wanting to learn more. I felt that the ""bad guy"" Nicolae should have been in this book more often since his name was the title. But getting to know the seperate characters keeps you reading!"
4,"The book is captivating preview of ""the wrath of the Lamb""","When I read the other two books in this series, I had to read ""Nicolae: the rise of the antichrist"". It covers alot of ground that was left out of the second book ""Tribulation Force"". However, it never let me down, always picking the right moment to cover the ""history"" of the books characters. In the style of the ""Left Behind"", a moving experience for the reader. I highly recommend this book and for anyone interested in a good series of books, read the ""Left Behind"" series, and judge for yourself if you need more in life"
2,Ummm...what if we're all wrong?,"This thought just occurred to me, but what if Nicolae isn't the Antichrist, and actually Buck or Rayford is?!? Wouldn't that be the ultimate plot twist? The Bible says that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, and maybe the good people are really evil and the evil people are really good. Or even worse, what if this whole Left Behind series is really not Christian at all? What if we're just being manipulated by demonic forces? What if these books are actually causing Christians to sin by being more materialistic (buying more books) and more covetous (wanting the next book as soon as possible)? I'm going to be a little more careful about all this stuff now. I mean, what if Y2K hits and all the non-Christians disappear and all the Christians are left on earth to suffer God's judgment? You never know - it could happen!"
5,Incredible!!!!!!!,"Finally a christian novel (series) worth reading, and waiting for. I read it cover to cover in one sitting, couldn't put it down! A must read for all!."
5,What are you talking about?!! Definitely the best so far!,"This is definitely the best book of the series so far. The authors definitely have displayed incredible insight on the events of the end times. I really can't understand why anyone would give the book less than 4 or 5 stars. Anyone who does so is being way too analytical and critical. Take it for what its worth. It's a marvelous interpretation of Revelation and should be taken at what it is; simply the authors' description of what end times could be like based on careful study of Revelation and prophecy. I have read ""The Last Day"" and it is also an incredible description of end time events, however, it should not be compared to the books of this series written by LaHaye and Jenkins. These books are extremely unique in their own right. My wife and I are proud to own the whole series and look forward to the next release."
5,'NICOLAE' is very infromative of what we will experience....,It's the third book of the series of books on 'Left Behind'. It informs us of who and what the Anti- christ is and when he will come. We will learn to recognize him when he comes if we are still here then!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Must be something more somewhere.,"Face it folks, Jerry Furland and Glen Kleier have this series beat hands down. Especially Jerry Furland's ""Transfer"""
4,AWESOME,So.... i love it!!! its huge and its awesome! but it was kinda hard to get on my gas pedal that i have though.
5,Top 5 all time bay area album .CLASSIC,This album sets the standard along with RBL Posse's first 2 albums . Incredible mic skill and unbeatable production make this a must have !!!
3,Tiny as the company name,"This product was as described but I don't remember it saying that they item were ""enlarged"" to show details. These earrings were tiny as the name of the company ""SilverSpeck."" They are a good quality and I do like them but I was expecting them to be larger than they were."
1,Not up to the task,"Initially, I was pleased with this tv stand. I purchased the large size to accomodate a 32 inch TV. After about a week, the swivel shelf appeared to be sagging slightly under the weight of the TV. At first I thought that this was an optical illusion, but the sag has become more pronounced. Currently, it sags about an inch and the turntable is becoming difficult to swivel. I intend to shore up the swivel shelf with a support, but this really should not be necessary for a product in this price range. This is the second time in the past two years or so that I have been disappointed by the quality of a product from this vender. It's a shame because they used to make some really nice, sturdy furniture."
5,My most used cookbook,"I have at least 20 vegetarian cookbooks and this is the one I have used most. I love that the recipes include a full meal plan - main dish and side dishes, as well as suggestions like serve with bread, green salad, baked potatoes, etc. It takes a lot of thinking out of meal planning. My family has enjoyed 80% to 90% of the meals I have prepared from this book and most of them take under 30 minutes to prepare. I highly recommend this cookbook. I wish Nava Atlas would write another one like this one."
4,Nice,"This particular mead notebook has cloth covering the metal spiral bind, so it wont get snagged or damaged from use like many spiral bound notebooks I've had----as long as you keep the notebook closed when not in use (the inside spiral is regular metal). There is also a convenient addition to the cloth bind for you to slide in a pen. Inside attached to the first folder section is storage for half and full size index cards and the first few pages in the notebook are index cards you can tear off--although this paper isn't much stronger than the regular paper. If you purchase a notebook like this with multiple sections (divisions), each divider has a folder on both sides, but only the first divider has the index card holders. This notebook should last a long time, looks attractive, and is practical. I've been using the smaller index card holder for sticky tabs for important notes. However, it's quite a bit more expensive."
4,How to have fun in the music industry,"Metal Molly - a strange trio that could either be the world's smallest quartet or largest duo... This is a fun album, nothing more, nothing less. Nonsensical lyrics lend themselves aptly to the weird and wonderful sounds the band coax from their instruments and vocal chords. I reccomend this cd for the young at heart, the fun-loving, the daring and those looking for a different side to music."
1,Mis-Marked size in slipper,Size is totally WRONG!!!! Ordered another 8N in a different color and it fits fine. This product is defective and should not be sent to any other customer..
4,worth it except for wind,"Was easy to install, took just minutes. Does all it says, except I get more wind through a particially open window than I expected. But maybe it is because its a Jeep."
2,"Pro Sports Car Racing in America, 1958/1974","Some really good photographs and, at times a good account of the object of same. ABSOLUTELY lacking of what races where run at what time and all of the accompaning data that you would, and have come to expect from a book such as as this.As such, if you try to correlate the data from other books with the non-existant data from this book.............Really nothing more than a 'magazine article' which had been given limited pages......A limited volume, which only leads us to wait, and hope for someone else to do a complete job on this subject.Dennis"
