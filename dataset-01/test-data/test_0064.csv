4,It's pretty much what you'd expect,It's a good movie if you like that type of genre. I would recommend it to people. Not much else to say about it.
2,mediocre,"AVP is about an archaeological expedition in Antartica with a group of explorers and scientists going down to find an aztec temple but find themselves trapped down there with Alien and Predator. The plot is ok but the acting is poor with Sanaa Lathan as the main human character Alexa Woods who manages to be the last left, i ain't tellin no more bout that. Anyway I didn't realize there was a battle cause I didn't understand it a bit, not very good. I didn't expect it to be this bad, and the quality of dvd wasn't good (well it was on pirate) but anyway don't watch it."
1,at the mountains of madness,this is the h.p. lovecraft sory. updated and with different monsters niether of which do it justice.
2,Underwhelming,"Turn on the wipers because AvP just hit the windshield. 20th Century Fox has just mocked all of the fans of Alien and Predator.1979 - Alien hits theatres. Groundbreaking.1986 - Aliens is released. Even better than the original.1987 - Predator - An earthbound Alien. A stunning blend of Action and Science Fiction.1990 - Predator 2 - Schwarzenegger is no where to be seen. Audiences are underwhelmed.1992 - Alien 3 - The movie David Fincher set out to make is never released. Instead, a butchered version is sent to theaters.1997 - Alien Resurrection - What was once a great and dramatic trilogy is now a sci-fi popcorn movie for the average movie-goer.2004 - Alien vs. Predator - Since at least 1990 fans of Alien and Predator have wanted to see the two creatures face off on the big screen. What us fans get is a mockery of the two franchises. 20th Century Fox had over 10 years to make AvP. The movie that we finally got is embarrasing."
4,Fun nothing more,"But if you are to truely enjoy this film forget alot of what you know about the Predator and Alien films and just enjoy it for what it is. This is by no means a good film but it is entertaining anf fun, even though it does not make alot of sense at times. I wish it could have been better or even have an R rating. But this is what we got so just enjoy it. Also I know there is a 2-Disc Collector's Edition coming I just don't know when, but wait for an announcment but it will proabably be here by the end of summer or fall..."
2,Inexpensive but Shrill Sounding,I wanted something inexpensive to add a little boost to the high end. Unfortunately these are too harsh for my ears. They're going to be sold cheap at the next garage sale & I'll spend a little more for higher quality.
2,A Return to Christmas,"I loved this book it explained the true meaning of Christmasand how families can be together on Christmas. To be thankful forwhat you have. It is also about an epic journey of love. A familieslove for there children and how there is always hope. I Think itsabout Christmas is more than gifts it is about love and thanks.ItÂ¡s a great book to read to your student, kids, and as a family.nn"
2,"A Jason Fan, but this album just doesn't kick it....","I understand what Jason is going through and i've been a fan for a long time (Perpetual Burn is one of my fave albums). But the only reason i'd buy this album is because it is Jason's, the music is very lackluster."
4,Great Book for Martha Fans,"As far as business books go, this one was pretty good. It was a light read and full of useful information (so much so that I will need to revisit this book in the future). Martha throws in a lot of her personal experiences in the book as well, which is an added bonus for any Martha fan."
2,It's okay,Didn't really get much out of it. Maybe because I have a degree in business and this book pretty much re-iterates what I already knew? Good to have if you really don't know much about business. Gives you an overview of things that need to be done and the little tips of making your business valuable to the customer.
1,thanks but nothanks,"i read a couple chapters in my proctologist's waiting room the other day where i found this book on a coffee table. in spite of it being slightly entertaining, i personaly don't take buisness advice form convicted felons. maybe that's just me? but to each his own."
3,The Thief with 20 faces,"Akira seems like your normal 4th grader. He goes to school, participates on the student council and cooks breakfast for his moms every morning. But he really is the mysterious 20 Faces, a ""gentleman thief"" who steals whatever his parents ask him to. One night while hiding from the police he meets a young girl who instantly falls in love with him. But can a thief really find true love?CLAMP has a wonderful knack for coming up with unique stories, and this is no exception. The characters are very memorable and the art is beautiful. However, it lacks some of the reality and depth of their better works, making this seem weak compared to their other books. A good read, but if you are looking for something exciting I would try Cardcaptor Sakura."
2,Meh.,"Some of the stuff Clamp does is just wonderful, and some of it not so much. This falls into the latter category.Females are always portrayed in this book as needing a male - the mothers have their son do all the work AND have him steel for him. The kindergarten aged girl in the book is obsessed with having a boyfriend and settles on a thief (who's a forth grader). The females are clingy, whiny, and useless.The males aren't any better. They do whatever they are told, coddle the females, and all but one don't seem to have any moral backbone. The one teenager who says that steeling is wrong is portrayed as a food obsessed bizarre person.The artwork seems very juvenile to me. It's not even close to the beauty in XXXholic. It's the kind of artwork I'd expect from a late seventies animae (think Voltron).All in all I'd skip these books and go for something with more plot and more depth like Angelic Layer."
5,What a deal!,This is a fantastic toy for a simpsons collector. It is a great deal for the money. It's very durable and runs great on our hardwood floors. With some practice you can get him to do a wheelie/spin. We customised our Bart by adding a cast on his arm and a bandana on his head. What a hoot! If you know a Simpson figure collector they will love this toy!
2,Fun to play with for a while,"I got this remote Bart b/c it was so cheap, and I have to say it's worth the money. Bart's arms swing around as if he were really balancing on the skateboard. Normal batteries power it for an acceptable amount of time. And it just looks funny!The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't work very well on hardwood floors. I was hoping to be able to run it around the house during commercial breaks, but the wheels don't get very good traction and steering doesn't work very well. Because it's designed to do a wheelie easily, not enough weight rests on the front wheels and they get very little grip. The throttle is either off or full blast so you can't slowly ease it into a turn. And unfortunatley once a little wax gets on the wheels (after about 1 minute), he no longer can pull off the wheelie. But again this is all based on indoor hardwoord floor use. I'm sure he works better on a surface with more grip."
1,Beware: this is NOT Abbado's Deutsche Grammophon recording!,"This recording was made during a live performance in Florence in May 1971, whereas the DG version was recorded in September 1971. The soloists of both productions are exactly the same, but the orchestral and choral forces are not. The recorded sound of the Florence production is quite awful (extremely ""boxy"", bothersome ""humming"" sound virtually throughout)."
1,not as advertised,"even though this is a used book, it was advertised as ""very good condition"" and it was anything but...very disappointed"
1,Extremely mediocre,"I love the Smiths, and I love music and concerts on DVD. Unfortunately this is proof that a good band and good format don't guarantee good content. The lip-synched TV performances are pitiful, and the music videos are not much better. I felt like shutting off the TV and just listening......"
5,Gladiollas Uber Alles!,"This 1992 documentary captures The Smiths ""Rank""-era with a lot of crowd favorites; Charming Man, What Difference, Panic, How Soon Is Now?, Shoplifters, Sheila Take A Bow, and Queen Is Dead.Now that's worth the price alone. Spend 45 minutes with a band so good, you'll pine for those days. Speaking of back in the day, just how is Johnny Marr wasting his time currently?"
5,sustantive information of one's life guidance in this time,"It has been long time since my exsposure to this gem. I like most of you loan our foremost treasures to our confidantes and ""friends?"" The particular book I had was part of a set of three at one time belonging to alocal man of repute his dated inside cover indicating a turn of the century period , as I recall when he so procurred .I surely hope the friend I loaned such {I'm sure!} treats this treasure as I do The world must never lose such heartfelt truth's"
5,Inspiring & Uplifting,This is the only inspirational 'self-help' book you will ever need. Note: It was written in the 1800s !!
1,Sucks!,"This one of the worst Blue Mountain cd's yet!, they sound nothing like ""dog days' or ""home grown"", everything is different, if the remainder cd's are like this, I'm glad they no longer are together, glad I got it used, not so much money totally wasted!"
3,"Comment about ""Torn away""","When I started to read this book, I first found it boring. The beginning was very difficult to read,because I speak German and in the book were so many new english words.But after a few chapters, when Declan was in Canada, it became more interesting for me. The book became better, when Matthew told Declan the truth about his family. The theme of the book is very real, but I `m not so interested in this story."
5,An Exelant Read,"Torn away is a wonderful book full of suprise, excitement, and suspence. I couldnot put the book down. Although it was quite obvious what would happen at the end I was still thrilled to find out what this exciting character would do."
4,Good for the Money,I use this every time I shave and I have seen great improvements in the areas where I share. Bumps starting to disappear and clear it and not as visible as before. I think it's a product you have to use regularly after shaving to get the best results.
3,It's alright,"I don't think this product was worth what I paid. I'm still looking for a different product. I heard so many ""great"" things about it, but it doesn't work that well for my skin type."
5,The Most Underrated Metal Album Of All Time!!!,"You gotta get this if you don't have it. There was nothing like it in the day and there is nothing like it today. Awesome vocals, ripping guitar solos, unimagined bass lines, and top notch drum rolls. This album is heavy doom at its tastiest. Progressive metal before there was such a thing. My personal favorite is ""Master Of The Pit"". With a searing opening guitar intro and one of the best solos ever in metal history at the end. This album is sophisticated,complex,moving and incredible. If you've never heard it. Take a listen. If you""ve heard it and don't have it..get it. If you want something different This is the one. No disappoinment here. A+++ rating."
2,Rapid decline,"It pains me to rate anything by Dennis so low, but this material shows (showed me at least)that he was rapidly on the decline from his Styx years. Even his previous album had 4 great songs and a couple decent. This one side A- all songs were decent at best(grade C+), side B- all songs were basically stinkers (grade D, although 'Person to person' probably gets a C-)."
4,Good value for the price,"I was skeptical that this product would be worth it given its price point compared to the other memory foam toppers. My wife and I had one that we really liked but we moved and it was kind of old and grungy so we tossed it. After sleeping for several weeks on a mattress without a topper, we missed it. This item came in the mail quickly <5 days and included the free pillows. The pillows were just so-so and took some time to fully expand after unpacking. I probably wouldn't use them on my bed but they are fine for a guest bedroom. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and so glad I didn't spring for something high priced just because I thought more money equaled more comfort."
5,Great choice for a new christian!,"I thank God for leading me to purchase this bible back in 1997, when I became a christian. It was very hard for me to understand the Old King James version. This bible is the New King James version, that is much easier to undertand. It really helped me to grow in every aspect of my life. For me it helped to translated the scriptures to everyday life. I would recommend this to teens, young adults or any new christian. You will truly be blessed."
4,A very good book.,A very well writen book.The book does not give enough information on breeding.A very good book.
1,Hott?....yeah right !!!!,"i just have one word to descibe you,cade= UGH!!!! how could toy makers be soo stupid. i mean, they must have designed cade in the dark!! look at his hair!! if you think he is hot,you need help"
5,Strong debut album! One of my favorites,"The production may not be the best but this album is pure fun. Catchy, strange and fresh (30 years after it's release). You haven't heard anything like this before. Some wont like the vocals, but it really is a big part of the album's charm. Guitars are awesome, melodic and powerfull. Buy this one if you like retro heavy metal."
2,No torque at all!,"I bought this kit for electrical work. The sawzall won't cut through 3/4 inch conduit without binding and stopping the motor. When I put the same blade in an old DeWalt sawzall, it cuts through the pipe like it was butter. Save your money and get a Milwaukee or a DeWalt combo kit instead."
2,Bummed.,"I'm not impressed by this cocoa powder, wish I could return it because I don't intend to use it. It's got an off vegetable scent, like the cheaper cocoas, not rich and warming and chocolatey. Out of the package, it has a back note scent of dishwater, it's the only reference I can make, sorry! I've tried ghiradelli, and this is similar to the cheap taste of it. I'm sticking with vahlrona. I baked a cake with this powder, and it had very little flavor, just bitter with a slight scent of chocolate. I gave it two stars, because it is better than Hershey's, ghiradelli, and the other supermarket brands, but, still, why waste time baking and cooking with it if it's going to taste only slightly different."
5,Interviews Out of Time,"This book is a collection of interviews with and stories from everyday people as they lived out their lives. I first read this book several years ago, yet I find that there are interviews and stories that I go back and reread again and again. If you are a Native or a student of Native American History, this is a good book to have on your shelf."
4,Suspenseful,I found this book frightning because being a high school student this could possibly happen at my school... Even though I found it frightning I though that it was very well written and that Lisa Gardner must have had to do numerous amounts of research for this book!
2,Boring,"This is the the 5th or 6th book of Gardner's I read - most of the D.D. Warren series and ""The Perfect Husband"". I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, especially ""The Perfect Husband"" and couldn't wait to get this book, the next in the FBI Profiler series. What a disappointment. I had to force myself to finish it. There was way too much indepth info on why and how a kid becomes a school shooter and it was repeated over and over - different wording, different chapter - boring after the first time.Also, as much as I tried I didn't find Rainie, one of the main characters, likeble or believeable. Of course even with all the time spent on her and her history I didn't have a feel for who she is by the end.I haven't given up on Gardner but I'll read my Kindle sample and the reviews a little better before paying $7.99 for another."
3,Good Start,"I really enjoyed her first book--The Perfect Husband--it had a great story, sexy, thrilling, fast paced. I thought with all the current dialogue about school shootings this would be a knock out book. The story was well developed and left a lot open for a sequel, but I wanted more from it. I ripped through it expecting something MORE to happen between the main characters, but I was left wanting more. Good commuting material for sure."
5,"A review from a sold-out, rocking Christian from Decatur, AL","This album rocks! I've never really paid much attention to Third Day before this album, and I must say that this is one awesome, message-filled group of songs that has a sound similar to the secular band, ""Matchbox 20"". To sum it all up, I repeat my first line, THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Given the time this individual has served in the US Senate, I expected to come away with new insights into the legislative process, and other truths of governing from the perspective of a senior Senator. I was disappointed and now feel my expectations were much too high. This work was nothing more than an unworthy condensation of everything we've heard on ""60 Minutes"" or the national news every night for a number of years. No new insights, no memorable thoughts, no persuasive and careful analysis and certainly no powerful conclusions. Senator Hatch's discussion of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings seemed nothing less than self-aggrandizing. The Senator's unnecessary tirade against a disgraced former President was unnecessary and, I think, below the station of a true Statesman. Recommendation: If you must read, borrow a copy; otherwise, pass on this one."
3,This is Al's Greatest Dixieland hits not his best hits!,"Al Hirt is the greatest Jazz trumpet player who has ever lived and he pioneered the honey in the horn sound not found on this album! If you want his best then get His Honey In the Horn Album! He is good at Dixieland, but his most beautiful and comforting music is not on this album. This CD is Dixieland all the way and do not judge Al the King Hirt strictly by this greatest hits album because it is misleading."
4,The Caterpillar Story,"This was published in English, French, Portuguese & Chinese. Maybe more.In a later version, titled ""The Caterpillar Story,"" it has been offered in many editions & bindings."
2,Good information horribly presented,"This book is in dire need of an editor, preferably one with Maya experience. While it is obvious that Mr. Choi posesses a vast knowledge of Maya, his skills at communicating this knowledge are severly lacking. Grammatical errors abound, and his prose is often repetitive and confusing, if not downright incomprehensible. Many of the images are utterly superfluous, and sometimes they even contradict the text. Also, on a number of occasions, the information given is just plain wrong. Going through the 800+ pages of this book was an utterly frustrating exercise, and as such, I have already advised several friends to stay away from this book."
5,Really good!,"Well, I must say that this book is very very good. Nice tutorials, some are dificult, but with some practice, you're there!If you want to learn caracter modeling, this is it! and also forget the ""inside Maya 5""...that's really is NOT for begginers :D"
5,BRILL in every way!!!,"This was my first christian album and it is brilliant Go West youn man starts with galloping horses and then the funky love crusade kicks in at the bridge with michael raping. This album allso includes the top 5 hit place in this world which proves tht gospel does have the power to cross over. In my opion out Go west young man and live the life are the best smitty albums yet and any one that doest have go west, go west,south,east,north and get a copy Brilliant!!!"
3,SO SO Recording book,"Gives explanations on equipment,such as effects signal routing,basic mixer functions,tells what mics to buy for what job,covers effects to some extent.But far as hands on recording...this book fails miserably"
5,The Little Schemer,"This is, without doubt, the best book I've ever read on computer science. It is also the strangest. It covers an astonishing range of ideas, from the practical matters of Scheme syntax, to some aspects of Goedel's incompleteness results.The pedagogical style is semi-programmed. That is, learning proceeds by question and answer, almost Socratic. I found it most useful to read the chapters away from the computer. This made it necessary to think through each question. Afterwards, I would go to the computer, work through each exercise and then experiment.Were I still teaching Computer Science, I would be inclined to use this book and approach for the first semester of an undergraduate course for Computer Science majors."
3,Quirky book from great photographer,If you are looking to see classic Walter Iooss images there are many better options. The photos in this book are more of a story telling nature and give you some insight into Walter's mind. Its almost a diary. He's a very interesting guy and this is a neat little book to read but not one to look to for great photo inspiration.
4,Reliable Bluetooth Headset,"I've had this bluetooth headset since 2005. I have used it until the battery's life cycle was fully exhausted (2007).Pros:- Easy to pair with mobile phones and my laptop- Nicely priced- Interchangeable coversCons:- After a year or so, a part of the ear hook broke away.Overall, I'm satisfied with the service this headset has provided me. It helped keep me safe in answering phone calls while driving."
3,The Golden Era of Bad Grindhouse Films!!!,"Most of these films are terribly awful like The Manipulator, The Legend of Bigfoot, Twister's Revenge, Voodoo Black Exorcist, Mama Dracula and much more. There are a few that I like such as Prime Time, Katie's Passion, and Black Hooker. Pretty much, the only movie I really love is Prime Time! Prime Time is extremely hilarious! I love all the skits and gags! It's a shame that hardly anyone knows about it and it's extremely hard to find. One night, an unknown source has interrupted all television around the world, and in it's place, some weird shows, commercials, and a sex telethon. There is news about aborting the fetus during it's 5th year of life. Ole Ben Lucas. Trans Puerto Rico, The Charles Whitman Invitational. Manny's Nymphs, The S**theads, and much more! If you love ol' crappy grindhouse films, you'll love DRIVE-IN MOVIE CLASSICS!!!"
5,Hours of enjoyment!,Less than 50cents a piece - what's not to like? Shlock at its best! Most were excellent quality. Perfect for vegging out in bad weather!
4,HER BEST,"This is my favourite Bjork cd, I go back to it time and time again. It hasn't got that stamp of age on it that her Debut has ( which STILL sounds for the most part like half-baked club music ) nor does it have the desperate everything-goes approach of Post. This is meant to listen to all the way through, and it makes for an exhilerating 45 minute journey. The ONLY thing for me that keeps this from a 5 star, perfect rating, is the fact that I like the single mix of All Is Full Of Love ( one of her best songs ever ) rather than the version found here. The cover, by the way, is absolutely disturbing."
2,Alarm call for Bjork,"Bjork should apologize to all Buddhists for her insultingremark towards Buddhism in her song ""Alarm Call""."
2,I think this is real hiphop that u are listening to here,"I think that this is real is real hiphop that u are listening to these fools got dope beats and dope ass rhymes and they got dope ass Mc's like steele,5ftaccelerator,DJevildee,and buckshot. I give it 2 thumbs up. If u want to hear dope ass beats & rhymes u should buy it."
4,Good Quality for the price. A little tight on Cat6,"I guess it's not fair to deduct a star because I can't read the description, but I bought these thinking they would fit on Cat 6 cable (despite the fact that it clearly says they are designed for Cat 5/5e) but this is not really the case.If you do buy these for Cat6 (which is thicker than cat5) you can still use these, however they will be very tight and difficult to slide over the cable. I ended up swabbing some vaseline on the inside of the sleeve part, which made sliding it on the cable much easier.These are the only boots I've ever bought, so I really don't have anything to compare them to but they do the job well enough and are easy enough to put on."
4,Works great,It's cheap and it works. Good for color coding cables. Beats climbing under or over searching for the correct cable.
5,"Excellent, intricate, and fascinating.","""Dictionary of the Khazars"" is written in three sections -- the Muslim section, the Jewish Section, and the Christian section, and deals with three points of view regarding the Khazar Polemic. (The Khazars had a pagan empire; historians believe they may have converted to Judaism as their official religion after inviting representatives of all three major religions).Demons, dreamwalking, and other fantastic elements figure prominently in this novel. This book is not a simple read, but it is a good one"
3,Recommended for Those with ADD,"Per the author's challenge to the average reader to discover his or her reading style within the confines of ""the book,"" I would suggest that the ""Dictionary of the Khazars"" be marketed to people who either 1) are effected by ADD [...] On the one hand, the book provides no reference point; much like hyperspace, the person who likes quick clicks and the illusion of complete control will take to the ""Dictionary"" like (insert your own bad metaphor). Any entrance point can become THE entrance point, and the story (which, by the way, contradicts itself at every turn) is set to provide worlds of diversion to those of us who enjoy the ""casual flip."""
4,Awesome music for the 80s fan,"Michael W. Smith in one of his best albumns in my opinion. Just to tell you my taste range I listen to Michael's older stuff more often than his new music. This albumn takes the music a step softer than project, but the lyrics are more thoughtful. The instrumentals on this albumn are the high point. If you're a longtime MWS fan, missing the synth solos of the 80s or just looking for more material by Smitty I'd reccomend this albumn."
1,College Dorm Decor,"This book's title should have been ""Quick Decorating Ideas Under $20 For People Under 20."" The book might be helpful to someone who is still in school or without funds because they are starting their first job. But it does not provide those on a budget with decorating tips that are useful in making a home look more elegant. Unfortunately, most of the ideas here are just plain cheesey. ""Quick"" is not enough, if it doesn't make it look beautiful."
5,creative,My kids enjoy this 8 in 1. They play on it all day. I bought it because of the color. And they enjoy the fun. With this toy I think that you can't go wrong. It teaches them as they learn. I have one 2 1/2 year old and one 3 year old and it has taught tham alot of stuff. I have a swing set for them that I bought at the same time and it is already rusting and they don't even use it. Plus it does not get it as hot as the metal.
3,assembly too hard!!!,"We got a rain check for this toy when it went on sale and finally got one yesterday. First problem, we needed to rent a truck to get it home. Second problem, assembly took forever! After reading all the reviews we knew it would be hard and had ""oil spray"" and tools ready. My husband and I pushed and jumped on the pieces and after several hours finally got most of it together. The colors are not as shown and with so many white pieces it looks boring.The pros: my son loves the door and the large slide."
4,Durable,"My daughter bought this item about a year ago for her daughter.It is true, they had a great deal of problems putting it together, but once it was completed it looked very appealing in their backyard. My granddaughter was delighted to have and ran outside to explore each and every step and slide it had.It is quite colorful, which certainly adds to the joy of a child's world, but as she is an only child she didn't play much on it. It seemed part of the fun was sharing it with another child. Also, due to our location we had to be very careful to make sure no snakes were hidden inside before she was allowed to play. I believe if you have other children that will play with each other on this, and you are not in a location where crawling critters can be a problem,lurking inside areas you cannot see without checking, this would be a winner. Certainly durable, colorful and entertaining."
5,Great Outdoor Addition,"My mom bought this for my daughter who is only 13 months old. WE were afraid that it may be took big for her but we were so wrong. She loves it. The only thing she has trouble with it climbing up it by herself....But when her older cousins come over they all play together wonderfully. I would recommend this to anyone who want there kids outside. The only negative comment is that the assembly is not as easy as the picture makes you bellieve. It took my husband and his brother to do it and let me tell you there was a few ""rough"" moments. But none the less it is up and My daughter loves it."
4,good well written,good keeps your interest all seem to come together would buy another one by the author ok ok ok ok
4,Nice story to compete the series,"This book completes the series that Maggie Shane wrote about a group of immortal ""high witches"", and I needed to complete my series. If you have not read the series, it is Eternity, Infinity, Destiny, and Immortality. The books do follow each other, so I would recommend reading them in order. However, if you have already read the other books - this is the story of one of the ""bad guys"" from the previous book (Destiny) coming to terms with the choices she has made throughout the years. It is interesting to see how her basic issue is that she is selfish, and that has driven her to do some terrible things. However, it does not cover the same details as Destiny (this is a Novella - a compainon book to the series), so I would recommend reading that book first or you will be confused by some things."
1,empty box twice,"I know that this blade will work, I am just not sure if it is actually possible to obtain one through amazon. About 5 months ago I ordered it the first time. They took so long to fill the order that THEY (amazon) canceled it! I needed the blade, so I ordered it again and the order was filled this time, but when it arrived there was nothing in the box! I emailed amazon to notify them of this problem. They said they would send another blade. the package arrived recently. It was another empty box! Now I am getting emails from amazon that I am suppose to return the first blade that they ""replaced"". I guess I will go down to the local hardware store (that I should have gone to to begin with,) so I can replace a blade I never recieved. Soon, I will probably have to replace this second blade. Nice."
5,One Of Benson's Best Works Yet,"Raymond Benson creats another exciting adventure. He takes the reader with Bond through his experiences from London to several of the exotic islands of Japan.Bond is involved in truly investigative work researching the mysterious death of an English pharmaceutical CEO and his Japanese family. During which he discovers a highly advanced laboratory form of the West Nile virus which threatens the alliance of the western world.Raymond's extensive research takes him to many of the islands of Japan. He shows the region's fascinating culture, history and beautiful locales throughout Bond's experiences during his mission.In this thrilling novel, Benson continues with the exciting Fleming style of great detail and brisk pace, including a well blend of interesting characters....Tattoo is a fantastic read for new and veteran Bond enthusiast!!"
1,maggiemae,"I am a long time James Bond fan and have read every book in the series.I thought TheMan with the Red Tattoo was the absolutelyWORST book in the entire series.Even the dialog-""you are our guest""-except for leaving out the word honoured-is diredctly from OHMSS.MrBenson is capable of much better work.I enjoyd 'High time to kill"" and 'Zero minus ten'."
5,A Quick and Interesting Read,"I couldn't put the book from the time I started reading it. Following the family through several generations was fascinating, especially in the context of the different historical events in Iran. Since I do not know much about Iranian/Persian history, I cannot speak to that portion of the book. I just enjoyed the book for the story it told and the glimpse it gave into the culture for Jews during this time period."
2,lost,"I loved Moonlight On The Avenue of Faith, so was excited to order this book. However, I got totally lost in the details of the story, could not follow who the characters were, and found it to be quite violent. I gave it a good try, but finally gave up."
3,fun to read.,"Jessica and Elizabeth's parents are broken up.Elizabeth is very sad and is plotting to get them back together,Jessica -on another hand- accepts that the relationship is doomed and vows to find a new ,exciting man to get her mother back together with.It is a fun book and I almost wish I had not sold my copy."
3,A good book of 70 of the most common knots.,"Peter Owen has put together 70 of the most common knots and illustrated them quite nicely. The book uses line drawings to show how to tie the knots and provides a short historical and descriptive paragraph on each knot.I felt more verbage should have been given in describing how the knots were tied, and the sections on Choosing and Caring for Rope were inadequite at best. To his credit, the illustrations Peter used were good enough to overcome the shortfalls in describing how to tie the knots. This book is a handy guide to tying common knots and knowing their uses, but is definitely not a complete guide to all knots.None the less, as an editor for a Scouting Magazine, I still feel it is a book worth buying and I do recommend it."
1,"Look at ""who"" reviewed this book.",One person gave 2 reviews on the same day and Midwest Books gave a review also etc. I thought I would break up the dishonesty a bit.
5,a must read,"The authors did an outstanding job writing this book. I had a hard time putting this book down, and will probably read it again before long. Everthing they went through is written in perfect detail. I would recommend this book to anyone who would want to learn more about the vietnam erra."
3,very good resource on the VN War,"Rarely do war books written so many years after the events they deal with have the vividness and detail of this one. The authors are equally adept at discussing the battle itself and the events surrounding it. While this book is not the greatest book on Vietnam (my vote is for Sheehan's _A Bright Shining Lie_), it is a thorough and engaging account of a crucial moment in the war."
2,Problems with facts stated by others,"I have read, with interest, We Were Soldiers Once And Young. I found a number of problems with some of the incidents stated. One vet whom I have interviewed presented a far different picture, one that criticized American commanders for an unnecessary number of deaths. It is important that battle history be as factual as possible, so future combat leaders can avoid pitfalls suffered previously. Amazon has asked that reviews discuss the book and not the author. But with this book it is impossible to criticize the book without criticizing the American commander, Hal Moore, for apparent battlefield errors. I agree that the book should be read. However, I believe all should not take the experiences communicated with self-interest by this author as being the gospel truth. The Vietnam War was lost by its incompetent senior officers... not by enemy offensives."
4,Saw the movie,"I have seen the movie and I thought that the book might be like it, but it is more for the soldiers than for a regular person who doesn't understand what the battles were."
5,Love this!!!,"Let me first to say I was shopping for a Littmann when I came across this one. After reading the reviews, my mind was made up I would give it a try. Boy, am I glad I did!!! I LOVE this stethoscope! Using it just about everyday for work, I can tell you it has great sound quality and appears built to last! Having the color option was just icing on the cake, but I DO get compliments on it all the time and I've had several co-workers ask me where I got it. I am confident in saying if you need this for general assessments, or for personal use, you will not be disappointed- especially for the price!"
5,"ADC ADSCOPE 603 stainless stethoscope, black","I love this product, it is good to hear the heart beat. If it is not better than littmann, it is at very similar level, and it is cheaper than littmann."
1,Good try but ultimately disappointing,"I heard about this author through some blog or another and went on to read about her illness. I enjoyed her poetry and her blog, and looked forward to this, her first novel. It started out well enough and initially I found the characters interesting, but as the plot unwound it became more and more unbelievable to me. And the characterization never developed to the point where I could really care. I'm so sorry but this novel was truly a disappointment."
4,The Liar's Diary,"A good book that offers insight into human nature. People are often not who they appear to be. The beginning of the book is sort of slow, but once it starts to pick up it will not let you go."
2,I kept wanting it to be better,"I had a hard time finishing this book, but I did so I guess that's something. It read a lot like RL Stine's adult fiction which is overly dramatic and full of needless cliffhangers, like someone who is used to writing for teenagers and can't quite translate for adults. I thought the story was interesting, especially the twist, but it didn't really capture me like it could have because I was distracted by the awkward writing style. Luckily, I got it from the library."
3,standard for downtown lounge music,"funky, inventive, hypnotic, consistent -- simply one of the best lounge music cd's of all time. this is the first cd i take out when i have company over and im looking for that style of music."
1,Tripe is Right,"I'd rather watch TV, there's not much of a difference.This book is as much a commentary on the author as Hollywood itself. Neither of which I find interesting."
3,The Pickup purchase,Product( the Pickup by Nadine Gordimer) in excellent condition and delivered on time. j. Reinecke
5,distant and bizarrely intimate,"at first it's weird, the omniscient-but-distant narrator, reporting everything like third-hand information, and i wondered why she chose to tell the story like that - why not jump into the lives of these two attractive and compelling characters, get into their heads and bed more -but then it starts to make a lot of sense, and ultimately it makes the story feel fresh and real and intimate without blundering into polemic or siding with either character or using their story to say something clumsy."
4,Enchanting,"Although I found the writing style a bit unusual in its ""flow"", I was once again fascinated by the author's choice of characters and storyline which seemed both familiar and exotic. It reinforces the belief that we underestimate the destiny imbued in any relationship. This would be a beautiful movie."
4,Airplane Cuff Links,The top review did sway me to buy this product. It came very timely. They are pretty nice but don't think they are 5 stars either. They don't look like a normal gold and gave as a valentine's gift. Will see if he wears them. Thanks Cherie Martinez
5,A very well written and important book,"I found this book compelling: an understandable, non-dogmatic, open-minded, non-technical yet scientific look at how mathematical game theory might be applied by someone trying to behave morally in a universe of limited resources. The concepts are clearly stated without jargon in such a way that people with little aptitude or patience for mathematics will remain interested throughout. An important book for anyone interested in morality at any level."
5,Terri's Rocking Videos and Tour,"I have seen Terri Clark live five times, and just recently flew to Portland Oregon to see her again! Terri is one who really expresses her love for music more than anyother artist that I know of. I have been a fan of Terri's since day one, and will always be a fan! I have all four of her cd's, and can't wait until she releases another one!! If any one out there reads this and loves Terri as much as I do, email me!! You can reach me at: tc2fan@yahoo.com Thanks so much !! Love ya Terri!!"
5,It is worth the reading,Not only can Terri sing but she's got the look's to boot.She's a great person and is well worth the time to listin to her.She's kickin country in the butt with her talent and she will be the best in a short time!
4,Great book!!,"This book is very funny, but I have to admit: There are alot more funnier books than this one for Calvin and Hobbes. But I'm not saying it's bad! Very funny!"
3,Lightweight Hobby Bench at best.,"I inspected an assembled H7721 at a garage sale in June 2010. It looks great, yet the negative comments have merit. You really need to know the level of clamping you plan to do. The side clamp is similar to one you may have used in your high school wood shop class. I would not pay over $275 for this bench."
4,The Value of a Life,"Nevil Shute's main characters resemble John Steinbeck's main characters - simple, straight forward folk with the desire to do what's right not in a heroic way but in a quiet way. But unlike Steinbeck's characters who struggle in the midst of chaos and injustice, Shute's characters struggle through small problems we all might face. The terrain is not epic but quiet and thoughtful. He writes a novel here that would never be a bestseller today. There are no large, out-sized egos to fight. There are no worldwide plots of conspiracy. Instead there is a death and a little girl to honor. I recommend it for the quiet, life affirming moments we all need but too often rush by."
4,Smile...,"With a few notable exceptions, Nevil Shute is the most optimistic author I have ever encountered. With a moral and physical compass, an engineer finds himself abandoning his quiet life for adventure. When I was younger, this character convinced my father that I should become an engineer.Give it a few pages, it starts a little slow.Light reading, because it feels good."
4,Delightful little book,"I'm neither a sailor or engineer, and this book is filled to brimming with both nautical and engineering terms, but it continued to be an intriguing page turner. Only the passages dealing with money dated this timeless little book."
5,Best movie I've seen all year,"Simply beautiful. I'm at a loss for words to adequately describe this film. It's something that you must experience -- words alone can't do it justice. Lost in Translation is an intelligent film that requires audience participation and self-reflection to really appreciate its true value and meaning. Break out of the daze the latest Hollywood action/thriller/comedy/drama has left you in, watch this movie, exercise your brain and soul, and bite into a film with substance. Not everyone's going to ""get it"" but for those who do, this film is absolutely wonderful, full of meaning, comfort, and beauty."
2,Way overrated.,"I like Bill Murray but this film is way overrated for it's own good. It's not even remorely funny, and its drags it feet to the boring end.I like Bill Murray but he can't save this movie."
3,lost in translation great title,"really looked forward to this movie,gave three stars for artistic effort,wish they'd remake it, develop it more, and we deserve 5 stars for getting through it."
1,Narcissistic bore,"To compare this movie to American Beauty is completely off base.This movie is neither a penetrating investigation into mid-life crisis nor does it provide the least insight into Japan, either modern or cultural.The awards it has gotten are purely the movie industry's way of rewarding its insiders and they make a mockery of the supposed integrity behind the awards process.Bill Murray has done some great work; this movie does not add to his reputation. And, to be a famous director's daughter! We should all have such credentials. The idea that a director's reputation is tied to the quality of the work has always been somewhat suspect, but this movie really shows how corrupt the internal Hollywood processes are."
1,Misrepresented,"Awful. Not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. How anyone could call this movie ""flat out hilarious,"" as a Rolling Stone critic did, is ""flat out lying."" Bill Murray fans, don't be fooled! There is nothing in this flick remotely like the Murray we know from Stripes, What About Bob, Caddyshack, The Man Who Knew Too Little, Scrooged, Meatballs, etal."
2,"Oh, hum.","I recognize the humor of highlighting the lost feeling people have in a high-velociy culture that seems so totally foreign in so many ways. However, for me this movie was two hours or so of angst. When it was finally over, my wife and I watched ""Ghost Busters"" to remind me why I ever found Bill Murray funny. Guess I'm too shallow to enjoy movies like this."
2,So so,"I was so excited about seeing this movie.It came to only a few theatres where I live. I had to beg someone to see it with me. I was lucky enough that I went to see it before all the nominations came out.However, I was not very impressed. I felt like the movie was going to pick up and it never did. Not enough of a story for me."
2,Vacuity,"Saturday Night Live used to do a skit called ""Bad Cinema"". This film easly qualifies. It starts slow and never develops into anything. Its not funny, devoid of drama, bla, bla, bla. How this movie was even nominated for any awards--let alone--win any is beyond me."
2,I wanted to like it....,"I was expecting a comedy and found a tragedy instead.Lost in Translation is a haunting drama displaying the emptiness and rootlessness of western culture; especially westernized Japanese culture. With stark character portrayals of an aging American actor and a young American wife, their out-of-place feelings for Japan mirror the same feeling of their domestic lives.I found the show tedious, flat, and empty."
1,"COULD NOT SELECT ""0 STARS""","Promoted as Bill Murray's most hilarious film, we were expecting at LEAST amusement when we shelled out $17 for two tickets. This one ties if not surpasses ""Cold Creek Manor"" for worst film of the year. Overpromoted, oversold, full of itself, snob-trash.Perhaps it's not chic to put down a movie that has someone with the last name of ""Coppola"" in the credits, ergo the raving critics. That this turkey can even get near the ""best anything"" list of nominees is a crime. One of the few movies that I really wanted my money back at the end. I hear the DVD is awful too. I'll never find out.Don't waste your time. There's nothing here."
1,The most boring movie I ever had to sit through,"Don't waste your time. THis movie is dull, dull, dull - a perfect example of navel gazing by Sofia Coppola. Thank god for Bill Murray - he saved the movie. Scarlett JOhannsen gave her usual uninspired performance - this girl is SUCH a terrible actress that I squirmed every time she was on the television staring vacantly off into space and pursing her huge lips. Blech. don't waste your time."
5,One of the best movies I have seen,"I am not certain how to put it -- sure, there's not much of a ""plot"" if plot is what you are looking for, and sure, you are bound to be offended by some jokes if you are so PC you don't have any sense of humor left in you (and if you can't see that right next to the funny things ANY westerner would notice and comment on -- let's not be hypocritical here -- there are plenty of parts in the movie that evoke the beauty of the country and its inhabitants).If what you are looking for is something that feels like life, that's both hilarious and touching, and makes you think about relationships, and choices in life; if what you are interested in is a movie with perfect actors that have unbelievable chemistry between them, and a director who makes you feel as if YOU are the one in Japan, then this is the movie for you. Clearly, one of the best films I have seen in a long time."
3,"Great film, Good DVD, annoying ads","I loved this film in the theaters and was looking forward to getting the DVD... and the DVD's great except one thing, the ads at the beginning. Focus Features/Universal decided to not allow viewers to skip past the previews and forces you to either sit through several long ads or fast-forward through them. DVD's were created so you don't have to fast-forward through stuff anymore! One might as well buy the VHS copy. I hope the user-unfriendliness is removed in future printings of this DVD."
1,How did it win so many awards?,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I actually fell asleep during the movie. I rarely laughed, and found it very difficult to stay focused and want to care about the characters and the plot of the story."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Sofia Coppola's seond feature Lost in Translation is an audacious filmmaking project. I found to be really enjoyable, thought provoking, and well acted. Bill Murray pulls out one of his best performances in years, although he hasn't necessarily fallen off.Two strangers in Japan going through the motions until a chance meeting sparks their livelihood.I encourage you to see this movie. It's what great filmmaking is all about.The DVD features a making of featurette, a few deleted scenes, and a conversation with Coppola and Murray.Highly recommended."
1,I FELT MY BODY DYING!!,"When the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie, I fled the theatre, arms spread wide, eyes ablaze, looking for something, anything, to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes. I wanted to bathe in bleach, or perhaps gouge my eyes out just to feel clean again.40 minutes into Lost in Translation (which, by the way, is a new code word amongst friends, meaning GET ME OUT OF HERE!), I could actually FEEL my body DYING! I would have collapsed on the theatre floor if the movie had gone on much longer. No, seriously,Most scenes went on for minutes (MINUTES!) too long, and were boring in both their content and meaning when it came to the paper thin storyline and simplistic character development. I want both my money & my 100 minutes back!Unfortunately, I'm forced to give this movie at least one star. There's not an option for zero."
4,Scarlett Johansson proves herself,"Scarlett Johansson proves herself an actress of the highest caliber in this simple, but profound film. She says more with her eyes and facial expressions than with her lines. On top of that, she is a beautiful young woman. Bill Murray plays the lost middle-age man to the hilt, maybe going overboard a bit with the sadness routine. We sometimes get a slight hint of his SNL wiseguy persona. I resisted the feeling that this unlikely pair were in love until she knocks on his door and hears the other woman's voice. The look of hurt in her eyes expressed her feelings perfectly. This is not a great movie, but it is worth watching at least once. Like another reviewer, I recommend only renting."
2,Disappointing & bland,"This is movie that you'll either rate high or low with little middle ground. I had high expectations, but at the end, I felt I had gone nowhere interesting or enlightening or been entertained. I don't see any Academy Award material here. My .02 cents worth."
1,I FELT MY BODY DYING!,"When the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie, I fled the theatre, arms spread wide, eyes ablaze, looking for something, anything, to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes.

I want both my money & my 100 minutes back, Sophie!Unfortunately, I'm forced to give this movie at least one star. There's not an option for zero."
2,Boring,"This is probably the most boring movie of all time. The only good point is Bill Murray and he only has one or two funny moments. I couldn't figure out if the movie was a comedy, drama or what it is supposed to be."
1,"Wow, this film is very ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....................","I CONFESS: I didn't make it through this film, I fell asleep halfway through it. Plus, it bugs me that I used a free rental to watch this ode to paint drying on film.I just wish the critics and the Oscar judges would be as honest as I am about this film. All the snappy dialog in the world can't hide the fact that this film GOES ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. Why don't they just create a ""let's give Bill Murray an Oscar award for being such a swell guy"" Oscar category and be done with it."
3,Hope you like previews,"This is the first movie I have ever bought that didn't allow me to skip the previews at the beginning of the disc. It allows me to fast forward through them, but I can't simply skip to the DVD menu. Does anyone else have this problem?I'm afraid I'll have to return it. I refuse to be forced to sit through advertisements on a disc I own."
2,"Lousy script, good acting and camera work","What a waste of time. If it wasn't for decent acting and cinematography I would have enjoyed root canal better. Come on, those that write and direct should be judged on their own merits, not just because of who they are related to. Having been in Japan before I can attest that it is a ""foreign"" place for us Westerners but a better script could have made this a more endurable movie. If you have time to burn, see this flick. If on the other hand your time is valuable, see a movie written and directed by proven talent."
2,all about hype!,"I think that if this film was done by anyone else, other than another Coppola, that it wouldn't have received very much attention. This film is mildly entertaining."
2,Good acting/Bad story,"I loved Bill Murray in this movie and Scarlett Johansson was very good too. The attraction between the two was undeniable.However, this movie had no story and the ending was terrible. I told my fiance...""I walked into this movie not knowing what it was about. I walked out of this movie not knowing what it was about."" I think that sums it up. What is this supposed to be about???"
2,Better viewed while pressing fast forward,"This movie, for all that's been said about it, just goes to show you that it's not your talent that matters but who you are related to.I gave Coppola another chance after Virgin Suicides and have decided to give up on her after seeing Translation.This movie was pointless, uneventful and boring. This is the only movie I can honestly say is better understood when fast forwarding through the whole thing.HORRIBLE!!For Coppola: stick to being behind the camera because your stories are worse than reading Lillian Vernon catalogues while on the toilet."
1,I want my Saturday night back!,"If you are a pseudo-intellectual, this is your film. You will be wowed by the lack of plot, the paper-thin character development, and the bored, vacant expressions on the characters' faces, which you will no doubt ascribe to their deep understanding of the timeless misery of the human experience.But if you are like me and just want to enjoy a movie without hollow pretense, save your money. At least I rented this one!"
2,99% Disappointing,"I bought and watched this DVD only a few days before the Oscars. While I agree that Bill Murray did an amazing acting job, overall, this movie rates a D- from me. Utterly underwhelming, I kept waiting to connect with each of the characters. It never happened. I am still unimpressed with Sofia Coppola's directing talents, tho I can see that there is definately potential. Ultimately, ""who cares?"" was the only feeling with which I was left.A real disappointment."
1,lost in reality,"The characters in this movie have no character. They sit around looking miserable, staring into space, and one wonders why. Is it because they are in a foreign country? Do they realize that there are curtural activies in Tokyo? Instead they worry about their hormones. Murray is old enough to know better. He gripes to the sweet young thing he has befriended that his wife does not understand him; even though she is a graduate of Yale and married for 2 years, she can commiserate with him. Sure. He proves his virility by a drunken romp in the sack with a redhead that he meets in a bar. In Japan, English is a second language, particularly amoung the younger set, but you wouldn't know it; which is ridiculous; even the translator has problems expressing herself in English. The movie is lost in translation alright, in fact it is lost period. I rented it for 3 bucks. I should get a refund."
1,Two hours of my life I will forget,This was really boring. The premise of a film is to tell a story or entertain the viewer. This did niether. I felt as though I was lost the entire movie--ending with an unfufilled feeling of wasting two hours of my life I will never get back.
1,This Movie Blows!,"I am a huge fan of Bill, and think he is funny in everything he does, but even he couldn't help me get through one of the most boring movies EVER. There was so much potential for a great show: Bill in Japan, not understanding a word being said to him. Instead there were numerous blown opportunities to captivate the audience, and some of the lamest conversations that seem like they will never end. I don't know why there is so much hype about it, its a pictural version of a sleeping pill, with the most enteresting thing being some of the beautiful scenes of Tokyo."
1,Over-rated pretentious art film! Just like many others say!,"I don't understand why so many people are addicted to these types of movies. I wish people would really say what they really thought about this film just to stop impressing their friends and convincing people of how ""deep"" they are to understand a film like this. Even as one who enjoys abstract thought and film, I totally hated this movie. There wasn't a plot and it reminds me of those types of movies that those people who were just hurt in a relationship want to make to express their undying sadness and make their ex's seem like total uncaring arschlocher. I also don't understand why every premis to a movie or story has to be based on love. It's not a very intersting subject, and it's not that I can't relate, I just find it a boring subject. I would give this film two stars, because the colors and the the cinemetography weren't bad at all, but someone else said it best first ""Good frames won't save bad paintings."""
1,Even less than one star !,Save your money ! In 60 years of going to the movies I have only walked out on one movie. This one! The most boring senseless piece of dreck I have ever seen. This is a prime example of what goes wrong when a fairly good comedian tries to become a tragedian.
1,A Miserable Failure,"I saw this movie in the theater the week before the Oscars and was very offended. I thought I was the only one that didn't like the way the Japanese people were represented. It was very stereotypical, not funny, and lacked imagination. Borderline racist might be putting it nicely. It was horrible.After seeing ""The Last Samurai"" where the Japanese people/culture were treated with such respect and dignity, ""Lost in Translation"" was a complete disaster. But Hollywood loves good racism. She never should have been nominated for this movie. The screenplay was awful. She just made fun of Japanese people throughout the entire movie. How is that Oscar worthy???The academy should be embarrassed that they nominated ""The Triplets of Belleville"" and ""Lost in Translation."" It's a tie between which one was actually more egregious. I've never written a bad review for anything on Amazon.com, but I was genuinely offended by this movie. I didn't like how the Japanese were portrayed."
1,Lost in Worthlessness,"I am at a loss as to why anyone would like this film. It is the sad story of a long married man, alone in a strange city, where he can not speak the language, with no friends to communicate with, & a young married girl in the same situation having been abondoned by her artist husband for a few days. Bill Murray's character wants badly to jump the girls bones but can't/doesn't. When he does get the chance to get laid, its by the lounge singer in the hotel they are staying at. It was a boring 105 minutes of film for me. If he wins for best actor at the Oscars next week, I will eat my hat."
1,Bored in Translation,"What a pointless movie. I cannot believe they gave an Oscar to this snoozer. I agree with the reviewer that the clout of the Coppola name is the only thing that got this monotonous movie made (much less honored with an Oscar).There are a couple of times when I felt hopeful the story (such as it is) might actually take off, like the amusing exchange between the Japanese commercial director and Murray. But too quickly the scene passed, and the viewer is left watching the protagonists lying around their hotel rooms, doing nothing but stare out windows and up to ceilings.If the two main characters think they are bored in Japan, they should try watching this movie."
3,"Movie is great, but blu-ray is lacking","First off, I saw a ton of reviews on here remarking on how they had to watch 10 minutes of previews and couldn't fast forward through it. I watch blu-rays on my PS3 and had no problem skipping through the trailers so I'm not sure where those complaints are coming from.The movie itself is great, it's by far one of my favorites.As for the blu-ray vs. dvd, I must have watched the dvd atleast 30 times. I've been over every inch of it. When I got the blu-ray I went directly to the extras and was immediately disappointed with the complete lack of anything new (aside from a trailer for Sofia C. new movie).The picture quality is a little more defined but not where I wanted it to be.Most of the film is shot in poorly lit rooms and results in some pixilation in the dark parts.Overall, sad to say, I'd say stick with the dvd."
1,So bad.,"I can't remember the last movie I could not actually finish before this one, but i turned it off after about 30 minutes. I wasn't even vaguely interested in either of the main characters. I hope Bill Murray returns to what he is good at; Good Movies."
3,Disappointing,After the Oscar and the pubblicity I was expecting a 'fantastic' movie. It was not the case. Very disappointing.
1,A Complete Flatliner,"I was told that this film was the best of the year and an absolute must for any serious film collector. Subsequently, I purchased it. What a mistake. My friends and I watched the film, silently taking it all in, and kept waiting for some pulse. It has none. The dialogue is completely flat and there is nothing interesting about the characters whatsoever. The viewer cares nothing about them. We laughed a bit during Bill Murray's scene in which he appears on a talk show, but that was about it. The most appealing element was the cinematography, which was indeed beautiful. I asked a friend who loved this film what the attraction was. She said it was ""so cute and sweet."" There you have it."
1,one of the worst movies ever,I don't understand what all the hype was about. Nothing happened during the entire movie. Don't waste your time!
1,What A Bunch Of Rubbish!,"Okay, here it is, the truth: This movie is so boring that I had to drink three Pepsis and eat a half-a-gallon of chocolate just to prop my eyes open. And for those of you trying to convince the rest of us the movie was too complicated for the average-Joe - or in my case, Jodie - to understand, give it a rest. I think the people who like this film may want to consider discussing Prozac with their doctor next visit.That's all. Please don't waste your money or your time. Watching grass grow is more fun."
1,Oops I meant to review another film,But since I dislike nepotism will drop a one star review down here. Seems I am not alone.
2,Cheap trip to Japan via whacked flick,"I dunno, I watched this with my wife and 15 yr-old daughter and all of us sorta thought ""Hunh?"" when this was over -- granted some of Murray's angst and dry wit har-har was good but it got lost in a dream-like, cinema artsy-fartsy chic -- uhh, ""When's something going to happen here that means something?"" It was a snoozer overall but being lost inside a voyeuristic and surreal view of downtown, big-city Japan and its gawdy USA-ism and techno playground kept me watching and then the movie ended -- click - EJECT DVD. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz Save yer $$$ for Radio or Second Hand Lions!"
1,This movie deserves a 0,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would give it a 0 if possible. It is about two bored people who get together and then bore those who are watching the movie.I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would like this movie. I have not yet found one single person who says they have seen it and liked it.One section of the movie was the longest 20 minutes I have ever spent in my life.I would have rather been in a dentist chair.
1,Disappointing to say the least,"I had heard good reviews of this Oscar award winner and then sat down to watch it. For the entire length of the movie I waited for something to happen in this movie, and was never satisfied. If anyone wants to buy it off me..."
1,Boring,"I understand this movie is about being alone.So alone is will be on my shelf never to bewatched again. A waste of $20.00. Who gavethis one a great rating? I would rather watch a ""chick flick""than watch this one again."
1,I hate this movie,"For the life of me, I cannot understand why this movie received so much fanfare from critics. I thought the movie was absolutely pointless and exceedingly boring! VERY, VERY, slow and not funny at all. It is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen (sans Computer Beach Party). HATE, HATE, HATE this movie!!!!"
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE,"It's just bad. No amount of good reviews could save this dreadful movie. I wan't to cry, because so many people had to suffer though it like I did. The Academy should be embarrassed that they voted for this racist garbage. The critics that gave this high marks need to consider getting a new occupation.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!"
1,Can you spell 'BORING?',"This is a non-movie! Nothing, but NOTHING, ever happens. I forced myself to watch to the end -- what a waste of time. And Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar for this performance? My advice is don't watch unless somebody pays you!"
1,"If you love boring, depressing movies then buy this one.","If you have trouble going to sleep at night, don't take harmful sleeping medicine. Buy this DVD and pop it into your player. You'll fall asleep faster.This movie is for people who like depressing stories about being alone and alienated in Japan. If that's your bag, then maybe you'll be able to stay awake and watch this movie."
1,Bill Murray must need the money,"Lost in Translation is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It is two hours or so (I must admit that I couldn't make it all the way through) of absolutely, positively nothing happening. My wife did manage to sit through Lost in Translation just to see if it would pick up and it doesn't at all. There is no character development, no drama, no suspense, and no anything that would make anyone watch this movie other than Murray on the cover of the box. It should be criminal to bilk unsuspecting movie watchers out of their time and money like this. If you decide that you have two hours of your life that you will never want back to waste on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Worth a Viewing,"I happened to thoroughly enjoy this film. Sure, it is hard to find a plot when you are watching the movie, but at the end you discover what it is really about. This movie touches real emotion and is wonderfully done. Hopefully Coppola's Oscar will influence more movies like this to be made."
1,Lost on Me,"This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The entire theater audience groaned at the end. One man even asked if there was anyone in the theater who enjoyed it. There wasn't.I finally understood the great reviews when I read the credits.Sophia Coppola, director...being the daughter of the famed Francis Ford Coppola can get you some great reviews, and even an Oscar, even when the movie is bland and boring."
3,"Great Movie, Poor DVD","This isn't a review of the movie, just a warning about the DVD. FIVE MINUTES OF ADVERTISING THAT CANNOT BE SKIPPED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In other words, every time that I will watch a movie that I love, I will start out angry."
1,I'd rather watch paint dry than see it again...,"This movie was terrible. I bought it based on it's rave reviews and I thought it was supposed to be funny. Every scene was more boring than the previous. This is the last time I buy a movie based on critics' reviews without actually seeing the movie. It's too bad b/c i really like Bill Murray, but this was not one of the highlights of his career, I don't care what people say."
2,Dull Movie,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I was waiting for the movie to get somewhat interesting based on the great reviews some people were giving it, but it never got any better. It's unfortunate Bill Murray played a part in this movie, because it does not do justice to his comedic talent."
1,apt title,"apparently i have missed the boat on this one...i simply did not 'get it'. it wasn't arty or quirky or challenging. i came away with only two thoughts: ""what did i miss?"" and ""bill murray is an actor who was not born for closeups"".while the japanese love of karaoke is good for a giggle or two,a whole movie it does not make."
1,$9 nap,"This has got to be the most boring movies ofall time! At the beginning of the move mywife promptly fell asleep and I had to fightto stay awake to see some entertainment valuein this film. The humor was cliche and theendless hours in the hotel room were unbearable.Regardless of whether you are in Japan or Europe,if you choose to mope in your room or go out andexplore, you are in control of your experience."
1,Don' t pay attention tot he critics. movie is horrible!!,"Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Because Coppola's daughter wrote and directed it, critics loved it. Trust me on this, this is one bad movie. Bill Murray is not a serious actor.....yet somewhow was nominated for an Acedemy Award for this performance. There is nothing even remotely appealing about the movie. A teenager may laugh on occasion, but that's about it."
1,Why did this do so well at the box office?,"I saw this film the first night that it came out and I must admit, I just don't get it... I didn't get it then, or since. Other than the memorable ""lick my stockings"" scene, I found there was very little to like about this ""About Schmidt"" type melodrama.It was just a story of a fading celebrity that finds himself lonely in a town of millions of people. The people of the country are made to be as celebrity obsessed as US movie fans, which I found in poor taste.But it did so well at the box office and the nominations?! Even for fans of Bill Murray's too few dramatic roles, I just didn't get the appeal... I went to donate mine to our public library, but they said that they already had too many copies in a branch library system of over 25 locations. I guess they didn't get it either.Bill Murray is always a good box office draw... I just wish that his agent AND Mr. Murray could have seen the writing on the wall of this flop."
2,great expectations . . . but . . .,"I had heard that this was an oscar-worthy movie and was looking forward to seeing it. Although I found it somewhat entertaining, at times, I generally felt that the story was jerky and disjointed. I don't mind filling in the blanks a bit when I watch a movie, but this one was asking a little too much. Bill Murray was quietly entertaining and I liked his performance. I just feel that the movie lets the audience down because it doesn't live up to it's initial promise to be an entertaining ride through Tokyo by two lonely people who are kindred spirits in spite of their many differences. It made a weak attempt at trying to grab at your heartstrings, but the attempt was a little too weak and again, disjointed. Left me wondering if the real heart of the movie was left on the cutting room floor."
1,ABSOLUTE DRIVEL !,This is a very poor movie and Hollywood does itself a great dis-service by lauding it as anything else.
1,a waste of my time!,"Wow, this was almost as bad as Punch Drunk Love! Seriously, I watched this movie waiting and waiting and waiting for it to get better. It was one of those movies where you don't want to turn it off because SOMETHING has to happen...but, alas, it doesn't. I recommend that you stay clear of this movie and get something with substance."
2,a complete non-event,"I do not understand how anyone can rate this film 5/5 notwithstanding the fact the director received an academy award for best director?!When I think of this film, the two words that ruminate over and over again in my head are ""boring"" and ""trite"".Besides one or two scenes with Bill Murray the film has no value as a comedy. The storyline is weak and amounts to nothing more than a friendship struck between two people in a foreign country...um...with a few stereotypical scenes thrown in of Tokyo/Japanese culture...and then it ends. I just cannot see that the film possesses any deeper meaning or artistic merit than that.I guess American audiences will lap it up but otherwise for those who have a tangible understanding of the outside world you will find the attitude the film has towards Japenese culture and language to be contrived and shallow."
2,A Disappointment,"I think this movie just passed right over the top of my head. Yes, I know the differences in foreign travel but.....I kept waiting for the story to develop and something to happen in this movie.Sorry, a waste of talent, movie money and my time."
4,Very Unique and Engaging,"Bob and Charlotte are 2 Americans in Tokyo. Bob is a movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, and Charlotte is tagging along with her workaholic photographer husband. Bob and Charlotte meet in a hotel bar one lonely night, and they hit it off. They have a great adventure in Tokyo and discover new possibilities for their lives.This movie is very unique. It has a very roller coaster like vibe. One minute you're feeling lonely and down, then all of a sudden you're at a night club or an arcade or singing karaoke. The two characters are both very different, but find common ground and become close. This movie also reminds us that life has endless possibilities, to seize the day, and not to take what we have for granted. It's not for children. There is some explicit content in it, but it's a great emotional movie for a mature viewer that wants to watch something different."
1,I want my money back!!,"Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen, what is the storyline, really boring from beginning to end, what a big dissapointment, I would not recommend it at all. How did they get to nominate this movie for an award, I should have read the users review first before I have spent my money and waste it. Im really sorry for my comments here but I know which is good and which is bad movies. They don't have 0 out of 5 stars that's why I have to put 1 star!!"
1,The absolutely worst film in history,"This film is a piece of crap. I had to give 1 star because I wouldn't be able to post otherwise.I just don't understand why so many people made a big deal out of this ""film."" the story is not there, period. of course, a film doesnt really need to have a linear story, but this non-story has no meaning of being a non-story. Is the picture beautiful in this ""film"" even? absolutely not. this film is definitly lost in-between translation (of nothing, I should say). all the misunderstandings between the main characters and japanese people in the ""film"" do not make any sense or have any purpose. another example of westerner's blind fascination about japanese culture-- totally blind and empty."
1,Abysmal,"I'm in the industry. I know movies. I see about 50 a year, mostly independent and foreign films. I know what makes a great independent film. If one more pseudo-intellectual writes about how I didn't get ""Lost"", I'll scream. Only an idiot would think this is a great film. Anyone who's actually seen a movie that didn't make the Top 10 Blockbusters will know this is film barely hits mediocre. The characters were unsympathetic, the dialogue was crude, and the flow/movement of the movie was horrible.Abysmal sums this movie up.If you thought this was a great movie, do yourself a favor and get out more."
3,lost in this movie,"I had high expectations for this film. I'd heard good reviews and thought that the theme offered a lot of potential. But I was disappointed to find it very slow moving. Perhaps it's fitting for the title. Not only were the characters, a young female and a middle-aged male, lost in their lives and alienated from their spouses, but they were lost in the linguistic and cultural world of Tokyo. And to impart that lack of rootedness to the viewer, we have to wander with them, feeling the same lassitude and confusion. I give it a few stars for taking a unique angle, but I didn't feel what I got from the movie was worth the time being lost."
2,Sex schmex...,"It seems that other reviewers feel that the only reason some might find this movie lacking is the fact that the main characters don't have sex.Not at all. In fact, I think I would have felt cheated had they taken their relationship past where they did.This movie was lacking because it had no direction, woefully poor character development, and did very little with copious resources to create a truly captivating story.Frankly, I think most people didn't like this story simply because it was boring.If you want to see two boring, rude, unhappy white people wandering around a foreign country while apparently appreciating very little of the culture and even less of the fantastic opportunity to expand their horizons, please watch this movie."
4,"Subtle, Mundane, Wonderful...","This film is not for people with short attention spans, nor is it for people that do not understand what it is like to feel out of place, to feel lonely. If you can relate, the film is like deja vu...lost in a world that you don't feel a connection to, knowing no one and feeling nothing. The disconnect is depressing for some but, for others, it is a common occourence. This film is about adjusting to this unknown world, finding comfort in meeting someone that feels the same way you do, and those people and events that you only encounter for a short amount of time but never forget. Visually, it is beautiful, and the actors give wonderful performances. I am very glad I bought this film."
2,Don't buy! At best rent. Don't worry if you never see it.,It's a dissapointment. It's a slightly sad whisper quiet dainty snapshot of living life out of a hotel room in a foreign country where you don't have many people you can communicate with. This movie has no crescendo. It's flat sad the whole time. Bill Murray just restrains his actions more to get serious and only gives one joke at a time and the jokes are spaced at least 15 minutes apart.It does make you wonder whether Bill will bag the girl or not and that's the suspense of the movie. I guess also the girl and Bill make each other's time in Tokyo less lonely. I just wasn't moved by this movie. You'd think a guy making $2 million to fly to Tokyo to do a commerical could afford to bring a few friends along so he wouldn't get bored.One of the bigger dissapointments I've seen in the last few years. LIke others have said it doesn't deserve the hype.
4,Unstanding Undermind,"As a long time Phish listener i have seen it all,This is a nice album, of course seeing them live is the truest way to enjoy the band.But its a good listen, I guess it's as proper as a sendoff as you could have.A great band that will be missed for years to come.Go see them if you can, All roads lead to Coventry in August."
3,Sinking,"With a few relatively contrived, extended instrumental sections, Undermind can still easily be considered Phish's anti-jam recording, even if much of their studio output had the same qualities which diminished from their live counterparts. Unfortunately this uninspired, but still admirably competent with regard to pop-rock prowess, release became the band's final offering of new material. Hopefully they will be on their way to amending that shortly."
1,Not worth any amount of time,"To echo the only decent, partisan review on this page (see M.Cagey's review) this album is just pure blech. The downward trend that was initiated by phish starting past farmhouse and right before the hiatus, is completed here. This is a bland, impassionate studio effort at best. It is really painful to say this seeing as I have been a devoted fan of their work since the early to mid 90's, but this album is really bad and if this is indicative of their passion, then they should be hanging it up. A mere shadow of what they used to be, any other album pre-Round Room blows this one away. No strong moments, and I'm not even sure if Mike even attended the recording sessions. To all you fools who continue to insist that phish can do no wrong, wake up. I'm gonna go put in 12-30-93 followed by 8-13-97 to try and force this abomination of sound out of my mind. The good old days indeed."
5,They put the HATE in HATECORE,Nihilism. Anger. Revenge. Hate. Pain. Rage. Blood. And that's just track 1. Boston's Blood For Blood define Hatecore with this amazing release. This makes Rage Against The Machine sound like the Monkees. It's all about revenge on society...You won't be disappointed.
2,bootboyNE.,"I just bought Livin in exile and this cd, revenge on society and their can't be a better dicotomy. Livin in exile is an incredible hardcore oi cd and revenge is a rediculous winy metal cd. The music is ok but the lyrics and singing is crap. I love the dual vocals and semi melody and musicianship on Exile. I would like to know what the rest of their albums sound like because if they sound like exile I want them, some of the best oi I have ever heard maybe besides the Main Street Saints. If they sound like Revenge I don't even want to hear them. There are no voting buttons because I don't give a what anyone else thinks. I'm just giving an opinion."
5,"the truth, only truth and nothing but the truth!","HI Jorge,I finished your book in 45 mins after I tore open the shipment from amazon. The excitement was due to the fact that it talks abt us(hmmm, i'm a phd student myself!)and I wanted to know who well u portrayed it. And you did it damn well! Just one complaint!!! I thought the book would be thicker...stories of grad life are bigger...and bigger it gets,we'll like it even more! So plz don't stop writing. I know u'll graduate, but pass on to your colleagues who are still looking for the light at the end of the tunnel!"
2,Not their best stuff,"Although this is one of my favorite bands, this is not their best stuff. Get TIME or OFFERINGS instead."
5,Daughter's Birthday,We bought these firey opal earrings with an antique (rose gold) finish for daughter's birthday. She was delighted!
1,false advertising,"the sponge that is shown is advertised as a much bigger sponge,than you order and here comes three tiny little sponges where as it will take two to compare with the size that is advertised. not good at all."
4,"not my favorite, but still cute!","I am a 29 year old Bratz collector (how's that for too old for dolls?). I buy at least 1 or 2 of each Bratz line, and I really wasn't thrilled when I first saw the Tokyo A Go-Go line. They're a little TOO cartoonish even for me. After a while, Cloe started to grow on me, so I decided to buy one....since she is normally my favorite Bratz girl, I picked Cloe. I think Jade is also pretty cute. Yasmin, Fianna, & Sasha do nothing for me though. Overall I don't think this line is one of the more interesting, but if you're going to get one, Cloe is the one to get!"
1,Bratz teach kids to be Bratz!!!,"I like all dolls excpet for Bratz!!! They have snobby, Bratty faces and they are dressed up like street girlz..I don't think they are very appropriate. Barbies and My Scene is much better!"
1,Sssoooooooooooooo u lyk bratz......................,"well I don't.Their heads are way too large, I mean if a human had no brain they would have a rather small head- See my point?AND they are really easy to break, I got one for my birthday and I wasn't too happy and then it broke and it made me realize how much I really hate, no make that dispise, Bratz AND have you noticed how they have stumps for feet, well that shows that the makers of Bratz couldn't be bother to design a decent pair of feet.Have a nice day and remember, MY SCENE ROCK THE WORLD!!!!!!!"
4,Good motivational book,This book has lots of great tips & ideas. It was also a very easy download to my Kindle Fire.
3,It's just okay,"Found out during installation that if your car has gps navigation, you must install an external speaker (sound quality so-so). The reason is the nav system already cuts off radio speakers when it's in use. You can't use a second cut off device without elaborate and sometimes dicey wiring. Hence the external speaker, which can be tough to hear at times, even with volume way up, due to road noise. Also, no privacy unless you want to shut down bluetooth to use phone normally."
5,Enjoyed it!,"I have read many of Elkins' Gideon Oliver books. Some folks complain that they're not as exciting as some (Connelly, Kellerman) but they're like soup on a cold day. The characters are comfortable and you find yourself caring about them. The books are always a good, dependable read."
5,Great book,"My wife and I read this book together and really enjoyed the fantasy of it all. We watched the movie later (which of course is very different) and definitely thought the book was better. Howl's antics are entertaining but no, he is not someone we'd want to be around. Will definitely be look at other Diana Wynne Jones books!"
2,"Great product, poor packaging.","The book came in the mail perfectly fine and not a single bit of harm but I was dissapointed with the packaging. It came in some sort of box flap, partially opened and I kept thinking of all the ways I could have had a damaged product from it. The box seemed frivolous and I new of many other different ways it could have been shipped easier and with much less expense on my behalf. I encourage buying from a different source when it comes to packaging and shipping costs."
5,Howl's Moving Castle,"I was very happy about the condition of the book and incredibly fast shipping!I love the book, must have read it like 3 times within a two-period week. I love how Howl is portrayed (which is a bit different from the movie) and Sophie as well. It was nice to read further character development for all. Great buy!"
5,Entertaining Adventure,"I am one of those who loves the movie version of the story, but often I've thought there were several pieces of the story missing in the movie. Therefore I decided to read the book and all of those pieces fell into place. I am a huge fan of many Juvinile Literature books and this one is very, very good. The writing is tight and suspenseful, without being scary, and the characters are fun with minor flaws. After completing the book, I much prefer it to the movie.I purchased the Kindle version and there are some mistakes, missing quotation marks and indentations that are too far over, but otherwise it was a very good publication."
5,What a Wonderful Book!,"I watched the film version of this book first. I've never heard or read about ""Howl's Moving Castle"" before. I enjoyed the film very much then I decided to read the book. After finishing the book this has became my favorite fantasy book along with the Harry Potter books.I like the charactors, the setting, the magic and the story very much. It is quite fun to read. I couldn't stop reading it. It's full of humor and some parts are very touching. I like every bit of it and I like the ending, too."
4,See The Movie First,"I go to any Miyazaki movie and so went to see Howl's Moving Castle. The movie ended up quite confusing in places and when I discovered that he'd gotten the story here I bought the novel.Ms. Jones' writing is superb, her imagination impecable and her sense of wonder intact after all these years. While not The Hobbit or Redwall, it is a fine story with more depth perhaps than the other two.However, be sure to see the movie first else you'll be quite disappointed since it doesn't follow the book very closely and loses a lot for that reason."
5,Way better then the Movie!,"This book is great! I saw the movie before I read the book. The movie is amazing (if you haven't seen it) and the book is even more amazing. I couldn't put it down. You receive so much more of the story through the book and you understand so much more of Howl and Sophie. Read this book if you love the movie. Again, great book."
4,Howl's Moving Castle,This was a book for all ages that enjoy a good fantasy. It was never dragging and had lots of fun tongue and cheek and you could really relate to Sophie [both young and old Sophie] It is a book that I will pass on to my Grandkids.
5,Howl's Moving Castle,"Well I highly recommend this book, if like me, you enjoy a good fantasy book. The plot was enjoyable, with all its twists and turns, it kept my interested."
1,Horrible,Horrible customer service !!! Sent wrong color to me and would not exchange for right color. I would not recommend this chair or this company!!!
5,Great Purchase,"Our grandson is on the swim team and spending the day in the bleachers can be uncomfortable. I purchased two of these and will have to buy another, as our daughter-in-law has already appropriated one for herself. They work great."
4,Great laymen overview,"Great book on the history of acient Iraq. Some of the most intriguing topics, are the striking similarities between pagan mythology and the stories from the Bible, semites are related according to their language (arabic-hebrew word for sun is from the babylonian sun god, BEER was invented by these people. Talk about contributing to civilization.It would be useful however if the author included an appendix to keep track of all the different peoples involved and where they are located on modern day maps. But there is a very great timetable and index included.Great book if you want to take a look beyond giving all the credit to ancient greece as most western historians are prone to doing."
5,The Ultimate Fighter is Reality TV at its BEST!,"Here's a show that's going to expose a lot of the American public to Mixed Martial Arts. Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, is a sport that became mainstream in 1993 when the Ultimate Fighting Championship came about. Of course, the sport has come a long way. It's completely sanctioned by State Athletic commissions and has set ules and weight classes. The sport's history is to complex to unfurl here so suffice to say that the reason MMA has become so popular in just 12 years is that it's more exciting than boxing and WAY more real than prowrestling.Enjoy The Ultimate Fighter Season 1 on DVD and keep watching Season 2 every week! The finale for Season 2 is going to a feature live fights for UFC contracts just like in Season 1."
4,Great new season,"Overall a great season. The end of the finale episode is kind of puzzling at best, but I really enjoyed all the season. I look forward to see where they go from here, but I'm a bit scared by the end of this season."
2,What might have been...,"I'm sure there are fans out there who came into this show in Season 3 and loved it. But to those of us who've been watching since the beginning, this entire season was an affront. The character change-ups were confusing and completely unnecessary, the show became more about the witnesses than the main cast of characters, and the show's once fantastic sense of humour was lost somewhere in between.This WAS the best show on television, now it's a run-of-the-mill procedural, and not even a very good or entertaining one. I can only wistfully imagine how this season would have gone had USA network left well enough alone. Certainly better than this subpar, thrown together mistake."
2,Disappointed,"Various episodes skipped and/or froze while watching. Of the three disc set, two discs skipped, but the third disc completely froze during the last two episodes which, therefore, were unable to be viewed."
1,Don't write a sequel to this one.,"I have read several books from Oprah's Book Club and loved every one. But this one, what happened to Oprah's tastes? I initially bought the book because it took place in SW Pennsylvania, which is where I spend the first 26 years of my life. Plus, the fact it was listed on Oprah's Book Club, was added bonus. I was extremely disappointed in the plot because I was waiting for the characters to achieve some depth. I guessed the ending even before all the characters were introduced. The editing left something to be desired given the numerous spelling and grammatical errors towards the end of the book. Frequently, that caused me to read sentences over and over to figure out what the author was trying to get across to the reader. I'm embarrassed to admit I wasted my time and read this book."
1,Disturbing,"I cannot believe how many individules have given BACKROADS such a high rating. Two weeks after finishing this book I still cannot shake the bad taste it left. I'm disapointed in myself for even continuing to read it, even though I was disgusted not even half way through. It is full of child abuse (mental and physical), vulgar language (how many times can one person say the ""F"" word in one sentance?) and least of all where is the plot? I felt as though I was reading in cicles, not ever getting anywhere..just ending up right back where I started. I will not recommend this book to anyone and most certainly will not permit any child's or teenage hands to turn the pages. This was my third ""Oprah"" book and the first I was disapointed with. What was Oprah thinking recomending a book with such a disturbing scale?"
4,"Democracy has no bounds, life has no limits","Back Roads by Tawni O'Dell is a virtual tornado that rips through the strip malls and drive-throughs of lowerclass America. The main character, Harley, is less of a individual that a post-modern summation of all that is flagrantly and despicably pawned off as ""white trash."" Even the name Harley (Davidson? Get it?) connotes the anger and violence of biker gangs and rednecks all across this country. O'Dell is not really telling a linear structured story here. Instead she wraps up all that American society has tossed off as the sins of the lower class (i.e. incest, domestic violence, shoplifting, cow tipping) and ably demonstrates that these flawed and angry people remain the backbone of this great country. O'Dell has a message here and she's screaming it from the tops of trailer parks everywhere: God Bless America, warts and all."
4,Not dissappointed,First time reading Tawni O'Dell and not dissappointed. I felt for Harley and the bad situation he was in from page one to the end. I will try another O'Dell book soon.
2,not so good!,"I was very disappointed with this book. i can't even believe it made it on Oprah's list, i am still trying to figure that out. i had just finished ""The Corrections"" and that was such a witty, intelligent book and to pick up ""Back Roads"" after it was a big let down. There are so many unbelieveable things in this book, it seems the author just tried to throw every type of abuse and dysfunction in this book she could think up. Also, you can tell it is a woman trying to write from a man's point of view and it doesn't work. I think people may like this book due to all the shocking happenings in it, but that doesn't make a good book to me."
2,Painful & Dark,"This book started out pretty fast, and I enjoyed the author's storytelling technique. However the unrelenting bleakness of the story just wore me down. One of the reviews on the cover said : ""A page turner, gritty...funny,... sexy,. It was a definite page turner, but it was like watching a train wreck and not being able to turn away. It was gritty enough for me to feel like I needed to bathe after reading it. I do not find anything funny or sexy about murder, sexual and physical abuse, not to mention incest and insanity. If you enjoy reading books that are bleak, sad, sorrowful and with no happy ending in sight, this is the book for you. Although I don't believe every book should have a happy ending, I read mostly for entertainment, and this book was not at all enjoyable for me."
1,Big disappointment,"I really expected to like this book as it started off with vivid descriptions of locales and characters. But it slowly and inexorably descended into a mixture of foul dialogue, foul situations, and some not-to-be-believed character interactions. The climax and ending are totally depressing and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This book is headed for the trash."
2,Waste of Money,"I rushed out to get this book for my holiday. I managed to finish it, but it did not relax or enlighten me. I was surprised that Oprah selected this book. The story line was just too much, although I did enjoy Jody, the youngest sibling very much. I looked for her in every page. I felt for this family but it was too disturbing to be an enjoyable read."
2,Just started reading......,I don't have any comments quite yet. Just started reading this book yesterday. It is kind of hard to get into. Depressing with Harley taking care of his 3 sisters while their Mother is in prison for killing their father. Will have to come back and give a thourough review when I am finished with BACK ROADS.
3,A waste of my time.,"I bought this book to take with me to the beach. It held my attention and I read it in just a few days, but I was very disappointed when I finished it. The whole story and the characters seemed very unrealistic."
2,"This book should be titled ""In the Gutter""","I did like the writer's style and found the character of 19 year old Harley to be likeable. However, this book really goes to the pit of society and paints a graphic picture of incest. If incestuous loves scenes do not bother you, or perhaps thrill you, then this is a very good book for you. If on the other hand, you find this kind of thing disturbing, then I would not suggest this book. Also, this is a dark book with a depressing tone throughout and a depressing ending. I wasn't quite sure what type a point the writer was trying to make, if any."
3,quick read,"a heady exploration into the origins of domestic abuse and oedipal lustings. the vicious cycle of violence and incest unfolds in lucid detail. the narrative portrays middle-lower class as hopelessly trapped and yet fails to offer hope for breaking out (which i believe there is). the dialogue is fairly routine and i failed to get a vivid picture of the geographic region. could've taken place in ""anytown"" usa, perhaps intentional, (but then why mention western penn. several times?) overall though, a good read that doesn't get bogged down with needless verbiage."
2,A disappointment!,"When Oprah announced this selection on her show and offered a brief description, I was intrigued by the theme - a teenage boy caring for his sisters after a family tragedy. I really wanted to like this book. How disappointed I was! Although compelling for about the first half, it seemed like the author just didn't know where else to take it. The incest theme seemed to be thrown in as almost an afterthought,and yet was supposed to be central to the actions of those involved. Very disappointing! Not at all like many of Oprah's other selections."
2,Not the best place to start with Saxon,"Good points- It captures Saxon at aruably their very freshest point, after the Wheels Of Steel album.Bad points- the sound quality is so bad that frankly I'm a bit surpsised that it was releasewd in this state. To anyone not familiar to Saxon the songs might just seem like a muffled nosie coming from the stage a lot of the time. I have a high end hi fi and even with headphones it's sometimes difficlut to make out exactly what's going on, especially on the closer Machine Gun. I's such and intnese song on the album, and it must have been incredible onstage at Donnington, but it sounds like someone brought a cheap tape recorder to the show and recorded the set with the tape recorder stuffed under 5 pillows.I give the bands performance 5 stars, but sorry, this CD itself has such a poor bootleg quality that I can't really recommend it and I give it 2 stars."
1,What was this load of ... aboot !,"When i first saw this movie i thought it was some sort of sci-fi channel spoof, but i guess i was wrong it was meant to be a ""serious"" sci-fi film! To call this movie campy is an understatement, Frankenstein was'nt just unbound it was a whirling dervish! Jeez... roger corman used to make better ....later guys."
1,waisting money,"This stuff won't suppport your back and it doesn't stay on the lower back, it keeps running up and down while I wear it, end up return this item."
4,I wish i had cable,"I thought the cd was great, but i haven't seen most of the episodes that the songs came from. The best was ""It doesn't matter"", I loved that song in When She was Bad. I can't wait to see the forthcoming episodes so i can hear the songs from the album in them,as i live in the uk and i can only see what's shown on BBC2. I would really have loved it if Cibo Matto's, Sugar Water could've been on the album too, i loved every song from When She Was Bad."
5,TRANSYLVANIAN CONCUBINE,"i love transylvanian concubine... i would buy this cd for that song alone! (it appears in s2 ep13 ""surprise"") its the song that is played after drusilla calls for ""more music"" at her party! great song!!! FISTS AND FANGS FOREVER!"
5,I THINK ITS TIME FOR A NEW CD,"I REALLY ENJOYED THE BUFFY CD, BUT SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD MUSIC ON THE SHOW CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A NEW CD WITH MORE GOOD MUSIC.YOU SHOULDVE DONE A CD FOR EVERY SEASON, I KNOW I WOULDVE BOUGHT THEM."
5,Just Like a Visit to the Bronze...,"I absolutly love Buffy the Vampire Slayer - the Album! As a huge Buffy fan I bought it right away not wanting to miss a beat. Besides being a Buffy fan, I a major Dru lover, so natrually my favorite song on the album is Translyvanian Concubin by Rasputina (the awesome mix that Joss played during Dru's coming-out party in Surprise). I must say that all the songs are great picks but the song one that I REALLY think that the CD is missing is Sugar Water by CHIBO MATTO!!! I mean how could they EVER leave that out! I crack up every time I hear that song! How could any of us (buffy fans) ever forgette the ""sexy dance"" Buffy did with Xander! Joss, please give me a happy ( :) ) and include it on volume 2!!!"
5,Best soundtrack I've ever had!,"I think this is the best soundtrack i've ever had. It has 18 songs, each different then the last. I believe every song has been in an episode of the show.Some of my favorites include ""I quit"", ""lucky"" ""virgin state of mind"" and ""nothing but you"".The songs fit very well with the show and are great for everything else. Some of my all time favorite music. An amazing soundtrack for an amazing show!"
2,Soundtrack=B.A.D!!!,"Hi, I felt that the Buffy soundtrack was a bit of a let-down, It hasn't got many of the songs that actually appeared on the show(2) and I was hoping to hear my favourites from the show, but they're not on it! I think they could've done alot better!"
3,"Great in parts, but . . .",". . . the vocals, yecch. He sounds like a singer for a teen garage band, just awful. Too bad, because this modern shoegazer type rock really works in places, songs like ""Last Act"" really kick the speakers out with big swirling guitars and a pounding drum track in long surging sequences, just the thing. And the melodies are good, there are hooks, which matters. But it's all a little too amateur night in arrangement and production (""Last Act"" for example veers off in one too many directions), and the singer . . ."
2,Woman Thou Shall Live!,"I heard ""God's Got It Under Control,"" sung by Phoebe Hines on [...] and loved it. Usually I listen to Amazon samples of the CD before odering. I mistakenly thought this was a Phoebe Hines album and didn't review the songs. Otherwise, I would have discoverd that various artists were on this recording. With the exception of a few other songs, I have played the entire CD only once. Customer service was excellent, but I was disappointed with my purchase."
2,This Book Is NOT!!! for guys!!!!,"This is a well written book but very improperly titled. It should be titled, ""The WOMAN's guide to online dating.""Guys if you're looking for a book that answers guy specific questions, look elsewhere. There are no answers here!!!"
4,An excellent coverage of a forgotten tragedy,"As an amature local history buff, I'd heard of the Sophia tragedy, but this book beautifully illustrated who and what was lost that awful day, and her loss meant to the community. The author brings to life the people aboard her, the efforts to save them, and all the ironic poignancy that always accompanies a disaster? How could the captain have know that first day was the only chance he had of escape, that the weather would never improve? Definitely a good read."
5,No survivors but still complete,"For a shipwreck with no survivors, this book is still thoroughly researched and presented through eyewitness accounts and records. Little-known shipwreck with almost unbelievable events."
2,Just Watch the MiniSeries!,"I usually love adaptations because they go more into detail than the actual film. I think the only thing I got extra out of this was that #6's name was Narisa. If you love BSG and just want a recap, go rent the DVD. Save your pretty penny."
3,Good independent summary of KC,"I found this snippet of video clips and commentary quite interesting. Although the DVD is prohibitively expensive for most KC fans, if you are able to get your hands on a 'friends' copy it is worth viewing. As for comments posted regarding 'illegal' activity and immoral behaviour, I think this is a little bit extreme. Maybe KC should have a look at their own rehashed live albums and endless compilations that prey on diehard fans before taking scorn on others."
5,Rich Mullin's Masterpiece,"Nowhere in his legacy is there a more perfect example of the humility and power of Rich Mullin's songwriting. The subjects range from simple family life to larger issues of politics and war. Rich never fell into the trap being too dogmatic though...even when he takes on the world's governments in ""While The Nations Rage"" or when he lays bare his own and our shortcomings in ""My One Thing.""Beautifully produced by Reed Arvin, this CD is akin to having a modern day book of Proverbs to pop in the player and listen to the wisdom of a man who loved God."
5,Rich Mullins in the real world rocks!,"I love Rich Mullins' music, and even now, 12 years after his death, still miss the wonderful music he used to make. This album is wonderful - personal songs (Eli and Let Mercy Lead both made me think that Rich had settled down, married and had children, he sings with so much empathy and love), songs that help us relate as regular human beings to the love of God. Definitely, he's leading choirs in heaven - too bad for us he got to go there so soon!"
3,So-So,"i've read all of Mary McGarry Morris's books and this one looked interesting.... and it was. The interaction among the characters as having grown up together in a small town was very true to life and my heart ached for poor Fiona. I thought the way Morris handled Fiona's loneliness and ""apartness"" from her surrogate family was absolutely excellent. I had a hunch early on where the plot was going, but the story held me interested enough to race through to the end. And of course the conclusion was a bit predictable.What was TOTALLY irritating and distracting, though, were all the typos and mistakes in the text! Didn't anybody EDIT this? What a shame! It almost seemed at points as if somebody had dictated the manuscript into a voice-recognition program because not only were there mispellings but words that sounded somewhat similiar in place of the correct ones. For this most annoying distraction I have to give this book fewer stars than it really deserves."
2,A surprisingly amateurish effort,"I found this book overly wordy and filled with cliches and unbelievable coincidences. Fiona, who could have been an interesting character, comes off more annoying than sympathetic. As I read it, I wondered if this might be one of the author's earlier efforts, which is being published now that she has achieved some success. None of the characters showed much depth and the situations were predictable and totally lacking in suspense. It could have been a decent book with more conscientious editing. Mary McGarry Morris can do better than this."
2,"Boring, Predictable and Ridiculous plot","Compared to ""Songs in Ordinary Time"" this book was boring and predictable. The characters never displayed any depth. I thought it was absurd the way 30 year old Fiona kept dismissing Patrick's inappropriate behaviour. I figured out the plot early on. Maybe the author will do better next time. I'll wait for the paperback on that one!"
2,Disappointing,Finally done with this book! Fiona Range is by far the worst book I've read by Morris. It was near torturous trying to finish this novel with its multitude of typos and grammatical errors. Whoever attempted to proof/edit this novel should be fired. I found the story boring and the characters lifeless. I couldn't wait for Fiona to slice her wrist or do something equally stupid given that her sole talent in this novel seems to be her ability to make one stupid decision after the other. The book's ending did not surprise me; I'd predicted it before halfway finishing the book. If you're interested in truly experiencing this author's talent read Vanished or Songs in Ordinary Time.
3,BUILDING MY DREAM HOME,"I DID FIND THE BOOK TO BE HELPFUL AND IT GOT ME STARTED IN CONSTRUCTING MY OWN HOUSE. I DID FIND ANOTHER BOOK CALLED ""EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO ABOUT BUILDING THE CUSTOM HOME, HOW TO BE YOUR OWN CONTRACTOR"" BY JOHN FOLDS AND ROY HOOPES THE PUBLISHER IS TAYLOR PUBLISHING CO. THAT BOOKWAS A GREAT COMPANINON TO THIS BOOK. BOTH TOGETHER WAS VERY HELPFUL.WHAT REALLY COULD HELP HOMEOWNERS BEST IS HOW TO COST ESTIMATE AND A PROCESS FOR GETTING AND COMPARING BIDS FOR EACH DISCIPLINE, AND A WAY TO RECORD IT EASILY."
3,Build Your Dream Home for Less,The book is very good it provided me with the information that I needed and even more.
4,Smitty's Latest Christmas Album great stuff!,"Michael W. Smith's latest Christmas album brings great warmth, variety & fun for the holidays.Not quite the groundbreaking album that his first Christmas album was...but great nonetheless. Definitely will get you into the Christmas spirit. The Boys Choir makes for a definite ""feel"" of the holidays!"
2,Did not find this book helpful,"It seemed like he kept saying the same thing over and over again, badly written and outdated. Talked about the success of Worldcom, which went under, never finished this borefest."
1,If you like Underworld your going to hate this,Make sure you listen to samples from this CD before you buy it. It is a totally different type of music from what Underworld makes now. I really did not like it!
4,Another Great Pick,This DVD was what you'd expect from a Scooby Doo compilation. A few episodes you haven't seen and a few that you have. My kids have watched it nearly every day since we got it and they love it!
4,Really Fun,"It was really great and fun, and I really enjoyed the new, original Christmas special, but the one thing that stopped this from getting five stars was the episode Tenderbigfoot. It had absolutely nothing to do with Christmas and there are so many other Scooby doo things they could of used in its place. But other than that, I found this to be thoroughly enjoyable."
4,A good choice among few options,"My introduction to the love poetry of Egypt came in a course on the Song of Songs (aka Song of Solomon) which used as a text Michael Fox's The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs. Ms. Fowler has translated these poems with philogical assistance from Fox. The result is a very readable translation - enjoyable on it's own. However, I found myself going back to Fox for the background to truly understand some of the poems - the cultural chasm and the passage of time eroded the meaning of the poems to me.However, the translations are lightly footnoted with required information e.g. that Menqet is the goddess of beer or that a word is added for meter. While I prefer translations that stand on their own, this is a good choice for an introduction to a little known poetry that had significant impact on our culture indirectly via the Song of Songs"
1,false description,"The description says: ""lightweight and durable PVC. Zipper front closure with storm flap. Large front pockets for storage with flaps. Adjustable hood with bill. Vented cape back"". Every word in it is false. In reality, it is made of common PE, and is an extremely simple disposable poncho which is sold in our local department store for 60 cents a piece."
2,Annoying showcase of stars,This movie seemed like just an excuse to get a lot of stars together to lure people in. It was pretty pointless with a typical and completely predictable plot line.
2,Difficult to love...,"I watched this with relatively low expectations, and they were disappointed! The film has no cohesive plot structure, just a series of meaningless(except Julia Roberts and Bradley Coopers)stories that are supposed to make sense and connect, but are really just boring. The characters are all very underdeveloped, and I didn't really care about anyone(except the above mentioned). I wouldn't recommend this film, especially not if you are thinking it might be like the charming Love Actually."
2,Fell Short,"Very disappointed...Know they were trying to mimic ""Love Actually"" but they did not even come close. I was bored and uninterested and regret my purchase and time I wasted."
1,Valentine's Day,This was the worst movie I have seen in years! I didn't even watch the whole thing it was so bad.
3,Instant viewing is great!,"On a wet day in the Pacific Northwest it's nice to have the ability to ""go to the movies"" and never leave the comfort of your home."
1,Another Bland,"Romcoms are all the same. When it's so uncreative that you know exactly what happens before you even see it, its not a good movie."
3,Valentine's Day,"Although a thoroughly enjoyable tale which lightens the heart of the viewer, this is really a poor man's version of Love Actually.The cast in this version is probably superior in ""hollywoodness"" but the original movie is far, far superior. Not to say that anyone who has not seen Love Actually will undoubtedly love this movie. There is much to love. Aston Kutcher is adorable and all the cast are fine actors in their own right. The tale lacks something in the telling and I don't know what it is. I have recommended it to my friends who have seen Love Actually and they all enjoyed Valentine's Day, just not with the same gusto. We talked about Love Actually for many weeks after, but sadly, this has not been the case with Valentine's Day. One persons opinion and all that I know."
5,Love and Loss all in one day,"I really loved this movie when I saw it in the theater. And I just continue to love it. All the vignettes and characters are great and engaging. Reed's story [which is one of the main ones] still moves me. A fun watch with few misses [I could have done without the whole Taylor/Taylor storyline, brief as it was. It was annoying and unnecessary in my opinion!] I would highly recommend this movie!"
4,A Predictable Rom Com,"It's your usual fuzzy romantic comedy with lots of little stories and an all star cast. It's an American version of Love Actually only Love Actually was way better. Don't get me wrong, it is a good ROM-com but it been done before lots of times. Don't get this movie if your not a HUGE Rom-Com fan because it is very predictable. Actually i am surprised that it's from the Director of Pretty Woman/Runaway Bride/Princess Bride because Garry Marshall can do WAY better!!!"
3,Valentine's Day,"I thought this movie was fairly good. It did have some laughable parts, however, for this many famous people...I thought it was definitely below par...unfortunately."
3,Different than I expected,Valentines' Day was a fun movie just a little different than I expected. The acting was good and the story line interesting.
3,"Wicked good book, but tough to read","This book is full of fascinating cultural references on Halloween and other celebrations associated with death. It is illustrated with some amazing artwork (like the front cover) and the details given on the celebration is beyond compare.My one complaint is that with all the references and citing it is a tough read. You need to work at it to get through it, but it is definitely worth it."
5,Downloaded Music,"wanted this album, did not know where I would get it if not from the internet,. So the ease of of just getting it on line was nice."
3,"A pedestrian, but readable, account of a momentous event.","Ramsey Flynn has performed a heroic task in researching the disaster that befell the Russian submarine Kursk. The Russians, clearly, are still not entirely forthcoming about all the events that led to the explosion of a torpedo inside the sub and the horrifying efforts of the Russian navy to first ignore the disaster, then its inadequate rescue efforts and the final attempts to blame the disaster on other nations.Flynn explains every important element of the disaster in considerable detail --- and that is unfortunate because Flynn's writing is a bit pedestrian. While Flynn never leaves the reader wanting for information, he sometimes becomes boring.Ultimately ""Cry From The Deep"" is readable and highly informative. You may just find yourself having to approach this book a bit at a time, lest Flynn's writing style cause to you to lose focus.Jerry"
2,Tips Are Not Strategies,"This book is good as far as it goes: it contains 50 technical writing tips. Examples: Prefer active over passive; Be wary of adverbs. The subtitle of this book is ""50 Essential Strategies..."" These tips, while somewhat useful, are not what I would call strategies. To take a line from The Princess Bride: ""I do not think that that word means what you think it means...""Some of the tips are well known (see above) and some are new, at least to me, and some are creative rehashes and combinations of various well-known rules of writing.I have not finished reading yet. When I am done, if there is gold buried somewhere between the covers, I will re-review and advertize the nuggets. Until then: 2 stars."
3,"Definitely not for young people, but a useful supplement for the teacher","After reading the first few lessons and introduction, I felt it nec to inform those in the homeschooling community that this book is NOT suitable for young people. There are a few s*xual refs and excerpts taken from adult novels, etc. It's unfortunate because the actual lessons are very good. Each of the 50 writing tips include exercises at the end for the student to try.Overall, I don't regret getting the book, and I will read it myself and use the lessons to teach my daughter in her writing, and practice the suggestions myself in my own writing."
3,Wild exuberant fantasy!,"Alright, but skip this one in favor of Perdido Street Station, which includes more characters in Mieveille's amazing vein of mythological/human/creature and much better plotting than King Rat, his first published novel."
4,Dark and twisted,"A dark and twisted tale of Saul, who gets framed for the murder of his father and escapes prison with the help of King Rat, who reveals to Saul his heritage, his destiny and his involvement in King Rat's revenge upon his ancient enemy - the piper. An original and very dark fantasy tale for adults: full of great characters and imagination."
3,Good ... but the best is yet to come!,"I should have enjoyed this book ... unusual rythms, engaging if flat main character, great themes. But I have to say it left me feeling let down, because the book I read before this was PERDIDO STREET STATION, China Mieville's sequel. It bears about as much resemblance to King Rat as the Lord of the Rings does to the Hobbit. So watch this space ..."
5,Toyko has never gone Better!,"This ""Toyko a go-go!"" doll ""Fianna"" is so cool.With her china fashions she looks like a sweetie.I highly recommend this doll for kids.I,as a pre-teen still play Bratz,and I don't underestimate then any bit!They ARE the greatest PASSION FOR FASHION!"
5,"BRATZ RULE, MY SCENE DROOL!!!!!!!!!!!","The Tokyo-a-Go Go Fianna rules!!!! I recommend this doll to Bratz Fans Everywhere. Her outfits are awesome, and I love the colored streaks in her hair. This doll is awesome. Remember,BRATZ RULE AND MY SCENE DROOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Awful,"This book is awful. Elena, the author, mostly read from the textbook. Anyone can read from the textbook. Why buy this book if the author is just going to read from the text? My suggestions is to go to Oracle and buy their CBT. It is worth it."
2,NO COMPANION WEBSITE TO SUPPORT YOU!,"This book states that it has a companion web site with additional review questions, a message board and periodically updated information. The web site is not a companion to the book. Other then the database used for the course and the answers to the ""Test Your Thinking"" question, there is no additional support (interactive) for this book. You are basically on your own to handle your questions. This book is really intended for a classroom environment but when you read the description on the book, you are lead to believe that you have a website for support. Disappointing and would not highly recommend."
4,airsoft bbs,"I manly bought this idem not because of the bbs but because it is a very good container to put in your pocket and it fills easily. I do have to shake the container sometimes to unjam bbs. If you do buy this product i highly recommend getting another set of bbs with a big open lid to scoop up bbs into the pocket feeder. overall i would give it a **** 4 star review. it would be a ***** 5 star review but it occasionally jams, which gets annoying in the middle of a airsoft war with your friends. I have a speed reloader to with also helps with transferring bbs into your clip.PRO'S AND CON'S+pocket sized container+easy to fill+perfect amount of bbs+ easily fills up clips- occasionally jamsCrosman Camo Ammo 6mm plastic airsoft BBs, 0.12g, 10000 rds, green and tanUTG Airsoft BB Magazine Speedloader"
4,most unique voice out there in songland,her voice is like a hubcap falling off and rolling --going 10 miles an hour down a dirt road 70 years agoin some west texas bohemian samll-town backwoods ghetto --beautiful and mesmerizing.
5,best book ever,I've never read anything as brilliant as this book. It's easy to read and couldn't put it down
4,epigrams of Minsky's views on the mind,"Minsky has assembled 270 of his essays into this handy compendium. Each is somewhat of an epigram; only one page long, including an occasional diagram. The topics all revolve around the mind and intelligence. You can treat this book casually, by randomly reading an occasional page. Or you can plough through its entirety.Written over several decades, the essays give an incisive view into many aspects of intelligence. Hence, Minksy explains why some university level topics like calculus were relatively easy to program. But why ""elementary"" tasks like having a program do the equivalent of a 3 year old kid recognise and arrange building blocks have proved to be enormously harder."
4,Simple agents and the human mind,"According to Marvin Minsky the mind is composed of a collection of simple objects, agents. Working together these agents creates our mind.Some might find this approach somewhat reductionist. However, in broad terms it lines up with my understanding of the mind. So this is ok for me. However, I think that there are many mysteries of the mind that we need to address.I.e. How can two agents, say sound and sight, bind together and give you an experience which includes both? And how do you really get from something as basic as cells to a conscious experience. All of this is hardly crystal clear .... And the books doesn't bring you any further inunderstanding these questions.Yet, it is, as other readers have stated, a highly original and thought provoking introduction to the major questions involving mental states, concept formation in the brain, learning theory, and artificial intelligence.-Simon"
1,No depth,"Because the book's non-technical nature and that it was written decades ago, the book reads like philosophy. However, there are better philosophy books written 2000 years ago."
3,"Good Sturdy Product, but also a bug magnet","My husband and I bought this for our son when he was 3. It was one of the few play houses he could walk into without having to duck. (he's very tall for his age) So that was a plus! Not too bad to put together, but after a few times, he never played in it. We realized (and guessed) becuase it was so dark inside that there were tons of spiders and webs in there. When we finally decided to get rid of it, we discovered it was infested with spiders.The next play house I would by for outdoor use, I would make sure it was very bright inside, and or partially opened on top."
3,Great addition to any instrument ensamble,My daughter got this for Christmas from Santa. She uses it in her little band. The only problem is that the string always falls off.
1,brokenglass,Ordered two of these frames for picutres Ive been putting off to frame and I received both frames w/ shattered glass.
2,Acceptable for the price,"This product does what it says: provides a lot of light. I have, however, found the design, materials, and workmanship of the product to be a tad questionable. For example, the hardware supplied to assemble the piece stripped rather easily, with little force being applied to tighten them. The switches to turn the lights on and off are a bit temperamental, too. You have to press them ""just right"" in order to get them to turn on and off, otherwise you'll just keep pressing and pressing to no result.Considering the price of this product, I'd probably still buy it again despite its flaws."
3,Pretty Good,"I like the music but Michael stretches the songs out a lot with no words. Also, he repeats words and sayings over and over like in Nothin' But the Blood."
2,Purely one-sided,"Fortunately I just borrowed this DVD, at the end of an hour of presentation, the narrator finally tells us that if we want to find the real truth, its actually available to us, just pick up the Bible and read it there. That says it all, how can one expect objectivity from programs like this. However it's recommended if you want to strengthen your faith in Biblical or Pauline Christianity."
1,Hope his other books are better!,"At the start, the mule drowns and by chapter three, you wish the book had also drowned. The first chapter provided an excellent hook, was stimulating and encouraged interest. From chapter two, a dreadful rambling ensued causing a rapid loss of interest. Even after putting the book down and attempting a restart on another day with a skipping of multiple pages to see if the author stopped rambling, I was unable to finish reading it"
2,did not find the characters compelling,"The book seemed to me to be a morality play with characters that I never cared about as individuals. I did appreciate its attempts to portray the great sorrow that hatred and revenge brings to all participants, but have read much more compelling tellings of that moral."
1,Waste of money and time. One of the Worst Ninja movies ever made.,"There is no special effect in this movie. It is acted exactly like a play on stage. When a person was killed by a sword, only his face was shown. There was no blood. The kung fu fighting is like kids' games. It's looks like a comedy but it's not funny at all. The women ninjas wear scanty clothings. One was shown wearing stockings with patterns made in the 21 century!After watching it for 20 minutes, I returned it to the movie store. It is not worth finishing it."
2,Not what I was hoping for,I was not willing to tune my guitar down a whole step just to be able to play along with the video. There was no mention of the altered tuning until after the video had started and I knew that if I had done so I would be struggling to keep the instrument in tune. However keeping an instrument tuned was clearly not a lesson being taught by this video as his guitar was quite out of tune and getting worse with every song. I finally had to turn it off and take it back to the library.I had hoped that the video would be about techniques that are unique to the 12 string guitar but it turned out to be mostly playing songs on a 12 string guitar.
5,Flowing riffs moving ya straight through all out energy,"This release by Reef has a style in and of itself. It's a blend of rock with a funky rhythmic feel, sure to get you on your feet. Unquestionably the band gets off to a good start with ""place your hands"". Highlights of the album...the soulfull ending of ""Consideration"" and the break-down midway through ""Don't you like it?"". And best song in my opinion ""Come back brighter"" Add it to the cart you won't regret it."
1,Too sentimental for me,"The Chicken Soup stories follow a formula, and are too sentimental for me. Some people like them though, and that's okay."
4,Another great album. Production lacks though.,"The songs on this album are very good and are intresting and engaging. Yet for some reason I can't completely get into it. The production (the first time the band produced an album themselves) is lacking. The production takes away from the songs and the album as a whole. Fugazi (both on record and live) have an amazing guitar sound and a thick, intricate, tight rhythm section. But here the guitars sound very weak and the drums and bass sound a little artificial. This type of extremly sterile production suits songs like ""Long Division"" which is softer but take away from songs ""Reclamation"" and ""Nice New Outfit"" which have a more live feel to them. The songs on this album are very good but because of the production I can't give it a 5."
1,overheats and crashes the system every time,"the expansion pack is an awesome piece of hardware, but do NOT buy this one. whenever i play games that use the pack, such as turok, star wars racer, or perfect dark, the n64 will overheat every time and cause the game to crash. if you're gonna buy memory, get the one made by nintendo. do not waste your money on this...."
2,over heats,the pack is nice for graphics but my pack seems to have a major over heating problum. If it is played for more than a half hour the game will freeze. I have a cooling system for the console now but it only allows me to get 2.5 hours then it will freeze again. I hope you have better luck than I did.
1,junk,Installing this into my N64 has made it automatically reset over and over. It has ruined my N64!!! I was sold JUNK!!!
3,Disappointing Atlas - Low Resolution Photographs,"I regularly observe the moon through moderate aperture telescopes and find these low resolution images of little use. Even a three-inch refractor will show far more detail. There are better sets of photographs, covering most of the visible surface, available on the web.However, the atlas will probably be useful to observers who are starting to find their way around the mooon's surface, as they will not be overwhelmed by fine detail.If you want to see good quality images of the moon do not buy this book; look on the web."
3,Not one of Psych's better seasons...,"I'm a big Psych fan, but not a big season 5 fan. My wife and I enjoy trying to solve the mysteries along with Sean and Gus, but in this season, they were just too contrived. The murderer was someone you barely saw in the episode, usually they only had one or two lines before they were found out. Great show, just not a great season..."
2,"Love the show, dislike what I got...","I love the show, no doubt about that. The issue I have is the quality of the product. As in the video quality was terrible! The quality is much worse than if I were streaming it from a poor connection. Very disappointed. Almost unbearable to watch on a larger screen."
5,This show is great to watch,I have collected all the seasons so far and this show is the best to watch. Its fun to watch these guys solve crimes. its well worth the money to watych a seasons.
5,Best season yet,I love the 5th season of Psych!!!! Since I live in Canada I don't get the USA network and have to wait (impatiently I might add) for the seasons to come out on DVD. The 5th season definately did not disappoint. I love the new relationship with Sean and Jules and that it does not overshadow the show. I enjoyed that they brought in some of Lassiter's family to get more background on him. The episodes are laugh out loud funny and I am really enjoying the little Canadian promos they are dropping into the scenes that are subtle but being a Canadian I catch them and love it! Already watching them for the 2nd time and will be watching them over and over again as I always find some line or pineapple that I missed watching the first couple of times. A must buy for any Psych fan.
2,Why can't they make a good PS2 casino game???,"Hard Rock Casino is yet another example of what happens when too many production companies get hold of one idea. The goal oriented advancement in ""Adventure Mode"" requires the player to play specific games, non of which have instructions. If the producers of this game put half as much time and money into gameplay as they did making in game hype and obnoxious voice overs this might have turned out to an an alright game, but they didn't and it isn't.A total waste of money."
5,Mom loves daughter's new CD,I have never heard of this group but I love their sound. Review for the seller is excellent packaging and shipping. Thank you for the very quick response and shipping. Will buy from seller again.
5,Amazing!,"This is easily one of the best cd's ever made. It's one of thew few cd's I can actually listen from start to finish and every song carries it's own. The music is catchy, meaningful and I feel original and fun. My favorites by far are Last Generation, Dead Promises, No Fear, Lucifer's Angel, ok anf every other song on the CD. Seriously amazing CD highly recommended!"
5,The Light of My Life ignited an eternal flame,"The Light of My Life is a spiritual autobiography of Donna Howard's commune with God and the Angels. This engaging book (she credits GOD as a co-author)skillfully written, takes you on an excursion with entertaining vignettes. With snap-shot glimpses of the fifth dimension, you delve into a spiritual realm reminiscent of Carlos Castaneda's books: The Eagle's Gift, Tales of Power, The Teachings of don Juan...etc. The difference--and it's a BIG difference--is that Donna Howard innocently portrays her sojourn, with shockingly breathless passages, like rollercoaster ride video-footage. She is a shrewdy observant participant, and yet remains humble. You become co-creators, with Howard along with her cat, in the parallel universe (beyond time and space). Transend and await her next publication."
5,Great fun!,"I'm on my fourth or fifth book, and I really enjoy both tracking the day's weather and looking back at trends. The back cover does tend to disintegrate by the fourth year, and pages do sometimes pull out from the spiral binding, but that's not bad for something that gets used every day. I hope Amazon continues to carry this book in its selections. I've bought copies for friends, too."
2,Weak output signal,"I've used the Shure SM58's and the wireless mic systems for years and bought this latest technical wonder. It does have a lot of nice ""bells and whistles"". I love the new ""AA"" power supply over the old vulnerable 9 volt tabs. I dislike very much the weak signal this mic puts out, even at the ""higher"" level (you get two choices). You've got to be within 1"" or so from the mic screen or be ready to crank the gain knob wide open. Only problem there is the mic gets overly sensitive. I even called the Shure tech reps; they told me this all was ""normal"". I wouldn't buy this model again. What good is any mic if it doesn't deliver normal gain?"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"THIS ADD IS ONLY FOR THE MICROPHONE. NOT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM..WOODWIND AND BRASSWIND HAS MADE GOOD ON THE PURCHASE, BUT THE ADD IS VERY MISLEADING. IT STATES IT IS FOR THE ENTIRE ""SYSTEM"" WHEN IT IS ONLY THE MICROPHONE YOU ARE PURCHASING. GREAT DEAL IF YOU NEED A REPLACEMENT MICROPHONE, BUT IF YOU NEED A ""SYSTEM"" DON'T PURCHASE THIS ONE.HOPEFULLY THEY WILL REVISE THIS ADD, AND IT WILL RESOLVE THE PROBLEM."
4,"good basic swing, rope is low quality","it is a usable bucket swing, our daughter likes it very much. however, the rope it comes with is useless, too short to hang from a regular 8 foot ceiling and low quality. ended up buying professional rope at home depot - another 10 bucks outlay.the swing is open enough to make it easy to put baby in and take out, yet the sides are high enough for safety."
2,Not the best.,"I haven't used this product very much for my son. It's a good swing, but with the spot that I have it hanging, it doesn't work well. If the ropes were adjustable we would use it, but the front ropes are too long and it's hard for my son to stay leaning back in it."
5,Excellent book of literature and fiction!!!,A book that is well put together and excellent for the young and old readers. Another plus was the fact I was born and raised in the area where the story takes place and could relate my own personal experiences to the book as well. Hats off to the author!!!
1,Mutually exclusive terms in the title...,"Visual Basic and good software design have simply nothing to do, it is a conflict of terms. I would strongly recommend studying Design Patterns and UML separately and you will be later attracted to learn a decent OO programming language like C++ or Java.Don't bother trying to make a chicken fly."
3,Good RDS Book,"The cover of the book says it will teach you how to build DNA based applications using ADO and MTS. I figured this would help me with my ASP work. However, Mr. Sturm builds a client-side application that relies upon RDS for the storage and manipulation of Recordsets. This doesn't help me to build DHTML or HTML based applications. I end up with state-based components that are not very useful for my ASP applications. No thanks. However, if you want to learn RDS features and capabilities this books sample application is pretty valuable.The first 7 chapters are a good UML overview. The rest of the book on physical implementation gets rather confused and relies on quite a few strange method implementations by the author. Read Business Objects by Wrox instead"
4,How to grow your own,"Another excellent book on the health and medical benefits of marijuana, a herb that has been around hundreds of years and would truly help man kind if the politics and Medical- drug cartels were banned instead of this plant. Read and see for your self the lies we have been told over the years."
4,Relaxing at Home,"This is a nice soothing CD to help one relax after a day of work.Many jazz recordings are dedicated to exploring new sounds. This one is much more traditional jazz, dedicated to preserving the legacy of jazz instead of creating new jazz alternatives. It is well recorded, and one can visualize being in a club listening to a jazz duo.In my Opinion: Where is Love, I was Telling Her About You, are the highlights of the recording."
2,Generic Guitar Rock,"Imagine the Clash: lead singer's voice, guitar driven songs. Now imagine Kraftwerk. The funky, clunky sound effects. Now, imagine that it's 1999 and for some reason putting these two grandfather bands together makes sense. Nothing spectacular, but not a disappointment for the rock genre, either."
2,His worst album to date.,The only song I like on this album is Secret Ambition. The other songs are very slow. For sure his worst album yet.
2,Review of Shooter,"There are a few things I've come to expect of a book whose primary focus is sniping. Most contain a brief history of the art, and some background on training and equipment. Shooter contains very little of this material. It does however have some excellent material concerning the war in Iraq, and the author's ideas on how effective ""mobile"" sniping teams can be in modern warfare.If you are looking for a reference work on sniping this is not the book, and others such as Out of Nowhere by Pegler and Sniper by Gilbert are better. If you have read these and are interested in how the use of snipers is evolving then I would definitely recommend giving Shooter a read.Originally I had rated this book low, but after rereading it I would change my rating to 5 stars.Tiger McKee"
4,A Novel Approch,"Overall a good and well written book. It surprised me how flowing the narrative was in this book, seeing as it was a biography,and autobiography at that. Shooter has none of the long drawn out side paths to the story, nor setting up one part of the characters life, then another. There is a bit of set-up in the form of the first chapter, and some side paths to the story, non longer then a page and most a single paragraph. The bulk of the story focuses on Gunnery Sgt. Coughlin's envelopment in the training and invasion of Iraq.There is the occasional cliche' and the book is as gung-ho as would be excepted from a Marine, but the smoothness of the storytelling and the Coughlin's clarity in retelling events far surprised those rather minor complaints.A quality book all around."
4,Fast Moving Story,"This is a fast moving story of one Marine during the ground war in Iraq and fall of Baghdad. Coughlin gives a little history on his early life and domestic troubles, but generally skips most of his military service except for the rush to Baghdad.Would have been a better book if he included more to explain why he considers himself ""the top-ranked Marine sniper"". As for the ground war in Iraq, he was definitely in the right place at the right time to witness some history (i.e. pulling down Saddam's statue).The book doesn't justify the title or cover page, but is is still a worthwhile, and fast paced, viewpoint of how the ground war progressed."
3,great story...written mediocre,"This is a great story but the authors seem to have cobbled it together a bit. Not too much combat, actually. But fun, quick reading. Just wish tey'd had better editors!"
4,Fun Simpsons Game,"I've been a huges Simpsons fans since a kid and have played most of the Simpsons games from NES Simpsons games to Hit & Run. This one may be the best from the sheer fact that the graphics are the best to date and the voices are the actual cast of the Simpsons. Graphics for the PS3 version are very good, but they could have pushed it a little further.Animation scenes are also brilliant. Plays & looks well on my 61"" 1080P TV. Also you can play 2 players for all the missions which is sort of fun. This game is a little too hard for little kids but ages seven and up should enjoy it."
4,NOT a simpsons fan,"I bought this game used as ive watched some simpsons over the years but i generally dont watch tv so i havnt seen most of the episodes and i havnt gotten around to purchasing the dvd yet.As for the game i really enjoyed it,it is rare that i put a game in and play it from begining to end without playing another game in between play sessions. this games has good graphics,good story,good humor and it was really enjoyable to play. the camera sucked sometime's and thats about it."
2,They did it again...,"I really don't like repeating myself but yeah, this DVD is missing several minutes of footage and basically everything I said about the Hell High DVD applies here as well, except this time I can not recommend the purchase of this release one bit. As of this writing, Media Blasters have released six Joe Bob Briggs DVDs, and of those six, two of them (Hell High and this one) are missing several minutes of footage as well as the Joe Bob commentary which accompanies this footage. Since the only reason anybody would really want to buy these DVDs is for the Joe Bob commentary, I consider this a very big negative. Somebody in the quality control department is obviously sleeping on the job at Media Blasters, and with three more Joe Bob DVDs slated for release before the end of this year, I fear for my fellow Joe Bob fans.Avoid this DVD and tell Media Blasters you'll continue to avoid their future releases until they get it right."
4,A Biblical story updated for the 21st century,"The parallels aren't exact by any means, but ""K-PAX"" is definitely a religious parable for the modern age.The movie doesn't reflect this but the book certainly does - which is rather surprising since the movie apparently follows the book almost to the letter. The only differences I saw between the book and the movie are the name of the psychiatrist who ""treats"" prot, and the fact that this psychiatrist doesn't do hands-on work to find out prot's ""real"" name in the book as he does in the movie.But these are nits in what is otherwise a wonderful novel. And to make things even more interesting Brewer has written a sequel to ""K-PAX"" called ""On a Beam of Light"". I want to buy this book or borrow it from my local library and read more about prot - his world (his personal world, not K-PAX) and the earthlings who inhabit it."
4,Amazing stuff!,I first tried the white ginger perfume when my mother in law brought some as a gift for me from Hawaii. I love it and so does my daughter. Over the years we've tried a variety of TerraNova products and have been impressed with each and every one. Their lotions leave your skin particularly soft. My mother in law passed away about 8 years ago and every Christmas we order a variety of TerraNova procucts to make her a part of our holidays.
3,"It's okay, but a lot of mistakes","A fair number of the sites are plotted incorrectly.The time scale starts at Archaic, which is actually defined by the book as any time during the Archaic or before the Archaic, presumably even back to the neolithic, so the Archaic time period is not particularly useful. A more useful attempt would be to include all the time periods a site was inhabited, starting with the Neolithic and ending in Byzantine times. This would not be too difficult to do for sites in Greece, but maybe it would be tough to do for other countries. It is okay to include just Classical sites, but include all the periods of occupation.It is not entirely clear what the purpose of this book is. It is already out-of-date. This is the kind of project that would be better suited to the internet, something like a wikipedia atlas of ancient history."
2,What a dissappointment,Tie dye is about color and feeling. The book is in black and white. How can you teach tie dye and batik in black and white. Waste of time!!!
3,Good for the wrong product,The product I received is amazing and looks great on my 2000 f150 however they look nothing like the image. It is a completely different set of lights that actually look better on my truck than the ones in the image. I am sure the others would have worked as well.
5,An extremely versatile tool,"I have used mylar ""space"" blankets for the past 30 years for near innumerable projects. Want to make a solar oven? here's a tool to allow that. Increase the rating on your sleeping bag by 20 degrees (put the mylar INSIDE the bag), I've made emergency ponchos from them while backpacking. Ground cloths, signal devices, sun awnings (in this mode they help provide cooling), insulation for coolers, animal shelters, a lining for an incubator.They don't have to wait around in your car or ""read bag"" to find uses! However, I carry them in each vehicle, I have one in each of my various (depending on purpose) ""ready bags"", in emergency kits made for the kids and in all the first aid kits in the house, vehicles, the ranch and other such haunts.This little piece of plastic may well be one of the premier tools of all time."
4,This is a great tape if you love to dance!,"I got this tape about six years ago and I have really enjoyed using it. I love the songs on the tape and the movements go with the song. The songs carry you away and you don't even realize how hard you are exercising! And once you get to ""Eli's Coming"" if you are not working up a sweat than you are not doing it right. It is a energizing tape that is a lot of fun."
2,this is too dated,"I needed a dance exercise tape. I thought this would fill the bill, but not only is it too dated, she really does not each you the steps."
1,"Awful, awful, awful. Big disappointment.","The product itself is flawed, made with shoddy materials that don't assemble as described, and looks terrible when hung up. The arms don't line up, they droop even without any weight on them, and the top bracket arrived completely stripped and would not screw onto the metal rod. Awful!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time.,"I gave up on this book after actually reading 95% of it. The only reason I read that far was because I hoped Antonie would ""man"" up to the woman she was supposed to be and dump that wimp Royal.The Prologue to the story was so good that I couldn't wait to read it, but there were too many falsettos even in that. For one thing, how could a girl of nine, so quickly dismiss her family's death and turn to Juan as her new father? She was not a baby. She knew how to speak English, so why did she develop that thick Mexican accent?Royal was so wishy-washey that he almost made me sick. And even worse, he was so self-centered he didn't have an idea of what was going on around him.Sorry I wasted my time on this book."
1,sucks,"This movie was a waste of time and money. No good story, the acting is horrible and i was really bad. Dont watch this movie."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"I'm being generous by giving this three stars, and that's because it was mildly entertaining. There are better Werewolf movies our there. This one is very thin on story."
2,Try it...?,Not really... But yes... Happy I saw it... Good story... Actors tried but they needed a better vision & a little bigger budget to touch up the details...!
3,Werewolf: The Beast Among Us,"I purchased this movie because I love movies about werewolves. I was excited when I began watching it but I couldn't understand what the actors were saying. Their voices sounded muffled and low.. I was disappointed because of that. The storyline was pretty good and the acting was OK...I'm going to try and watch it again and maybe put on the caption feature so I'll know what's going on in the movie...but if you want to give it a shot go ahead, maybe the sound will be better on your blue-ray. Hope this helps...I read some reviews before I bought the movie and other folks seemed to like it...I just sorry I coudn't understand the dialog.."
3,Average,"I am a horror buff, I really wanted to go 2 stars. The main character looks like a banker which I can get by with, but Acting like a banker! Lol Now thats scary!"
3,College Level,"This is a very informative book with excellent content. However, it is written at a high level and often times hard to grasp. You must read, reread chapters to ""get it"" but once you do you will be glad."
5,Wonderful surprise!,My son was absolutely delighted to receive these wooden practice swords for his birthday! He has just started up Karate and found these quite useful for some of the practice trainings he has to do for his dojo. Thank you so much for delivering them under the expected time as this was an added bonus!!!
3,Ok if you know it all already...,"Nice reference book, but full of mistakes which may make it a little difficult to follow if you don't spot the mistakes. The CD is useful and answers to the questions/problems at the end of chapters also helps. Overall not bad, just a petty it is so full of silly mistakes..."
2,Disappointing,I ordered a small and I wear a size 3 dress. I could hardly get this to stretch past my ribs up to my chest. Couldn't even wear it for Halloween.
5,Great resource,The layout is good. Seems a bit bulky for only the New Testament. But the comparison of the NIV and the NASB is really good. The layout of the Greek is very interesting and helpful.Overally very good.
5,great deal,It was just like new for much less the price. Very happy with this purchase. I would highly recommend. Thanks
2,this is ok,"i recently reviewed this ""modern classic"" in Christian music and was somewhat impressed with some of the work. I think one of Smitty's strong points is that he has always been able to stay with the current popular sounds. Unfortunately, on this album he went a little too far with the then-popular 80's sounds. Screaming guitars, sappy synthesizers, and uninteresting melody lines are the norm on this album. I did like songs such as ""Lamu"". My favorite track is the last track because here a truly genius piece of music is displayed - had he only used such originality in his lyric songs, I think I would have liked this album more."
5,"Pinstriping Masters: Techniques, Tricks, and Special F/X",I found this a very informative and inspiring book. I've dabbled in signs and lettering for thirty years and it inspired me to get out my brushes and lay down some lines.
1,Very Misleading,"My girlfriend had an iphone that she ran over (dont ask how)and i bought her this phone to hold her over till she can afford a new one. When i got this everything is in spanish. All the books and cd is in spanish. The phone itself was in spanish. I finally found the settings and changed it to english, but all the alerts and alarms were in spanish still. I got little to no reception. 90% of the day the phone would read, emergency calls only. It feels very cheap like your gonna break it just dialing a phone number. My girlfriend used it for 2 days and i finally threw it away. On the plus side it did come with headphones and lets you download quite a bit of music to it. Also the wall charger was these two thin prongs, but came with an adaptor to fit in regular outlets. I dont know what country uses this plug in but i can make one guess. I dont recommend this phone for anyone unless your in dire need of a cheap phone fast."
5,Astonishingly Enlightening!,"Human culture it seems, has the amazing capacity to record unimaginably ancient technologies and science. This book answered for me the mystery concerning the persisting existence of myth, and may have touched upon its lost importance to Humanity. These pages may have revealed for the first time in this format, elements of a secret knowledge desperately needed by Mankind today. Important knowledge preserved in archetypal imagery and stories, which after millennia may have been finally decoded."
5,A Real Life Changer!,"Since I was child I've sought answers to numerous difficult questions, and try as I may, no one seemed to have any answers they could back up with solid evidence -- until I found the work of Laura Knight-Jadczyk.When she says she has spent a lifetime seeking the truth she certainly shows it in her work. I've read this book twice and am now reading it for the third time. It's dense with facts and hypothesis, and is completely referenced as to her sources. There is such a wealth of information she has uncovered and tediously pieced together, including reading between the lines to fill many of the gaps, that I am nearly overwhelmed!To say that I'm glad I found this book would be a serious understatement. This book is priceless -- a must have for anyone who really wants to learn about our world, its real history, the possible true meaning of the ""holy grail"" and ""ascension,"" and how such information has been hidden from the masses."
5,A Quick Acting Antidote to CompulSorry Education,"Reading this book is one of the best things that ever happened to me! After plugging along through one book after another, this one pulled together all those historical threads in such a way that it not only gives you the understanding of why things are like the way, but also how imperative it is for one to free their mind from the poisons of false beliefs. There's a lot of dead end alleys out there. Yet this book will not only give you a map of the past so you are not doomed to repeat it anymore but also a flashlight for the future!This book is a great reference book too and digs deeper than anything you've ever seen before. My children love to hear me read some of it to them. I am quite amazed at the author's base of knowledge and her keen ability to link clues together. Read it and be healed."
4,Like Country Music... You'll love these videos!,"From Haunted Heart to Cadilac Style, this Louisiana native knows how to cook up some Jambalaya and also #1 hit videos! Don't pass up over an hours worth of ture to heart videos!"
1,One-sided and distorted information,"This book was full of mis-information about pregnancy and birth. The author used ""facts"" from unrelated scientific studies as ""proof"" of her arguments regarding obstetrics. The author is trying to scare readers into following her own narrow birthing philosophy."
2,"Look good, but not buff","So I bought these shorts and I thought they would make me look buff like the guy in the photo. Turns out that you need to have image issues, take steroids, and have the personality of a hardboiled egg to be as buff as that guy. Oh well."
1,scale is very inaccurate,"I've had this scale for almost a year and it has never given the same weight twice; sometimes weights taken only a few seconds apart vary by 8-10 pounds. I've taken to weighing myself 3 or 4 times in a row and then averaging the results. Even the average doesn't seem accurate. I've had friends weigh themselves with similar results.Given the fairly high price of this scale, I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than a modern decoration for one's bathroom."
1,The worst written drivel I have read in ages.,"I can't believe someone is actually expecting to get paid forthis trash. It is horribly written, makes no sense, and itspseudo-religious babbling is insulting to anyone with at leasta two digit IQ. Do yourself a favour and pass this one by in alarge arc, much as you would a turd."
4,A decently written work of fiction,"This novel depicts the main characters of John Anderson and James Barborosa as they struggle to find themselves in a drama packed story. I won't go into much detail about the book except to say that it is excellent. The storyline is interesting, the characters flow and the overall message is a positive, uplifting one. A recommended read."
3,FOUNDING MYTHS,Very good and quick transaction. Book arrived promptly in the condition advertised. The last half of the book itself was a little too much like a text book for my liking.
4,The small people get no respect,"You can't tell a good story about everyone. The writers' for the big winners select a few good characters to create an image that will do more to unify the nation than the deeds themselves. The author does not like the way our story has been neatly trimmed and written, he would like it to more untidy. But then the kids would have read about Paul A, B, C and D riding through night yelling: ""The British are coming."" And then the author does point out that British were already there anyway. What a spoil sport."
1,"Terrible quality, won't stick to anything!!",This tape is terrible. It won't stick to cardboard!! Isn't that what Shipping Tape is supposed to do? I'd avoid this product until 3M fixes their quality control problems. (maybe they used Teflon for the adhesive!!).I've emailed 3M to see if they stand behind their products. I expect much better quality from a name brand product like this.
1,The reviews are correct - it doesn't stick!,"The tape does not stick to my cardboard boxes. Seriously, I wish I would have read these reviews before buying the tape, but why should I research reviews of tape before I buy it? I went to the store, this was the priciest tape and said ""heavy duty"" so I assumed: best tape!Big mistake. So the thickness is 20 times as strong as other tapes? Who cares if it doesn't stick to simple freaking cardboard boxes! I taped my boxes up one weekday evening, put them aside to move into my storage unit on the weekend, and then come Saturday I see the ends of the tape peeling away from the cardboard! Upon further inspection, the tape just peeled away from the cardboard without even stripping the top layer of paper! That is some lousy adhesive.I'm just glad I noticed early how crappy this Scotch tape is, and I will always look for another brand now.Scotch Heavy Duty Shipping Tape - AVOID!!!"
5,Tape holds strong and stays clear,"This is the best tape for a multitude of uses. It is strong. It doesn't shred of tear like the inferior tapes out there.The rolls are large and can be used with or without a tape dispenser. Obviously the dispensers are handy and 3M has a couple that the tape will fit.3M H122 Dispenser for 3 Core Box Sealing Tape, Compact and Quick Loading, Grayor3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenser (H180)Use it for:Affixing Mailing labelsSealing shipping boxesFixing torn maps (do we still use them?)Making business cards into luggage tagsMending a broken garage door windowRoll it inside out for a quickie lint removerand on and on..."
2,Strong but what good is that if it won't stick!,"I thought it was me until I read the other complaints about the Scotch Super Strength Tape not sticking to packages. While this may be a very strong (labeled 20x stronger) packaging tape, it's not much good if it won't stick to the package.I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking. In fact the cheap tape was very sticky, so much so that if you pulled it off the package, it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it. On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape. So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much. Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products."
1,Bad stuff!,"This tape is strong and clear and doesn't curl up. That I like. But it is very hard to use in a dispenser gun because it is difficult to tear on the blade one-handed. Instead of tearing it just pulls out more and more tape until I have a piece much longer than I need and I have to tear it manually. So pros and cons.Update a few days later: worst tape I've ever used! Yes, it is strong and clear but it REFUSES to be cut in the tape gun. Maybe it is TOO strong! I have to manually cut it every time. I won't buy this stuff.Further update after using it numerous times: I can't believe all the great reviews! Worst packing tape I've ever used, and I've used TONS over many years. I will probably end up throwing them away and not even use them up due to the troublesome nature of this tape."
5,Quality packaging tape.,"Pros:1. Thick and it sticks!2. Much cheaper buying from Amazon than Office Depot or any brick and mortar store.Cons:1. Due to the thickness of the tape, it is fairly difficult cutting the tape when using this with a tape gun."
1,I have used this product for years but this lot doesn't stick.,"I have happily used Scotch heavy duty tape for years and have always liked it. I recently bought a 6 roll package of this tape and find that it is much flimsier than what I am used to and furthermore, it doesn't stick to the package. I turned over a box I was sealing and then found what I had just put on the other end had all fallen off and was sticking to itself.Suggestions anyone?"
2,"Useful, if production is taken into account","There's some useful information here, but before buying, do note the production information. This version has been optically scanned and manipulated in such a way that numerous typographical errors are present. Also, illustrations are omitted in this version."
2,This is Sealing Tape,"Despite what its description says, this is sealing, not packageing tape. So, if you enjoy ""tape battles"", buy this and save a buck a roll, and you'll be in for some fun.I'll pass, and pay a dollar more a roll for tape I don't have to fight with."
4,Good System,"I recently purchased at circuit city, $50 less than amazon.com. I thought they were partners? The dvd player didn't work but return was no problem. The sound is very clear and the bass is strong. I have to keep the bass turned down due to apartment living. Hookup was kind of a pain. Once I discarded the directions and used logic it worked.Remote for the dvd is a bit poor as one button acts as left, right, up, down and enter. It is easy to hit enter unintentionally.I don't think the product description makes it clear but this is also an am/fm tuner.Overall, I'm very satisfied and would buy it again."
5,The best Christian CD ever made.,"Simply put, but absolutely true. I had the supreme honor to meet Rich Mullens and go to several of his concerts. My friends and I went to volunteer at the Reservation he stayed at in New Mexico. A more humble, sincere, gifted musician I will never hope to meet. Really, you should buy all of his albums, but if you only choose one, this should be the one. I do not mourn his death, even though I miss him. He is where he most desired to be, singing songs to the One he always sang for."
2,Warning on Portability,"YOU CANNOT GET THE SAW THROUGH A 30"" DOOR WHEN MOUNTED ON THE STAND. Everything else is great. So what? I can't move it to the basement, from the garage into the house, into my storage room. The width is 29"" at the wheels. Sounds good - if any of my doors opened 180 degrees and didn't have stop molding. In practice 27.5"" should have been the design width they worked within. That should not have been difficult given the saw width is 25"".And don't think you can just turn it side ways and slide it through. With the stand and blade guard installed (both require tools to remove), the profile is more than 29"". You can wiggle it through but I doubt the plastic blade guard will survive too many attempts. The whole assembly is also very heavy and awkward when trying this.Don't underestimate how important this is. Only my front door is greater than 30 inches. Every other door is 30""."
5,Enjoying The Saw And Myself !,Origanally I purchased the saw without the stand and thought it was portable. After purchasing the table saw stand I realized the saw was more portable and I could move it around without effort. Currently the saw is in a basement with a set of access stairs that rise greater than 50 degrees and I can wheel the saw up and down without effort. The saw was easily mounted to the table with good instructions and hardware. I currently own a Dewalt Mitre Saw that I would like to mount on a Bosch wheeled unit . Alot easier on the body and especially your back.
5,"Bosch Starts With ""B"" as in BEST","The Bosch people never cease to amaze me. Recently at my friend's house, I saw his Gravity Rise Wheeled Table Saw Stand. His table saw stand was folded and something that usually ends up sitting in the middle of your workshop, was neatly folded against the wall. IT only took him about ten seconds to pull his saw out and have it ready to use. It takes longer to open up a card table. What a brilliant piece of engineering. Bosch takes their tools and develops them as if they were going to use them themselves everyday. Definately a product to buy.Bosch TS2000 Gravity-Rise Wheeled Table Saw Stand"
4,Bosch table saw stand,"Pro: The construction of this stand is excellent as you might expect from German engineering. It is very sturdy, made of quality material and easily assembled.Con: The advertising is misleading with the term 'Gravity Lift', which implies that it is easy to raise from the flat storage position. My saw is old and heavier than current models (Craftsman M113.29940) , which probably accounts for the difficulty I had in this respect. The advertisement states that it will accommodate a variety of brands of saws, including Craftsman, but the owner's manual states only specific models. I had to make transition pieces from plywood to accommodate the hole pattern for my saw (no big deal). I was also misled by the advertising in thinking that it collapsed vertically, when in fact it must be collapsed to a vertical position first and then rotated to the horizontal.All in all the stand is still very useful and I am keeping it."
5,Fantastic Stand for taller people.,The saw sits pretty high so you better be taller.I found that it was really easy to operate. Love the tires although they could be bigger for some rough terrain.. It rolls well.Going up stairs or down is the only flaw with this stand.I love having this stand since it is so easy to setup and it is really easy to store the saw in a couple of ways.
4,Traditional DP book - doesn't disappoint!,"I am a big Diana Palmer fan, and I really liked this book. It bothered me at first that the hero was so cruel to the heroine, but as another reviewer said, he more than made up for it by the end. This is an emotional story and a very good read. I recommend it."
3,good read,"this book was a good read. but then, all of her books are. she gets enough romance and suspence together."
5,An absorbing window into dispirited lives,"Signal Hill Stories is an outstanding anthology showcasing of five original short stories revolving around the boys and men of Los Angeles by Alan Rifkin. Each deftly written tale is filled with longing for something seemingly unreachable, whether for a parental figure, the drive for sex, or the desire to simply get life right. Signal Hill Stories is an absorbing window into dispirited lives and the quest for meaning amidst the ghosts of a multifaceted and often deceptive urban sprawl. The stories comprising this outstanding compendium include: ""The Honor System""; ""The Idols of Sickness""; ""Sonority""; ""After the Divorce""; and the title story, ""Signal Hill""."
5,ged math,Great product. Works flawless and easy to install. The price was right and the shipping was fast and excellent. I would definitely refer this product to anyone interested. Thanks for the great service.
2,Overpriced.,"Van Buren was one of the lesser cartoon studios of the Golden Age of Animation, and this DVD collection shows why. As a historical curiosity, it's worth examining, but you can probably find it for under a buck at dollar stores instead of purchasing it here."
2,This item did not work,"This item was listed as working with my car, however it was not even close to fitting my car. Had to return it."
3,Warning: Shredding ahead!,"1986's Masque was the debut album from Japanese guitar virtuoso Kuni, a guitar player and songwriter in the Yngwie Malmsteen mold. For this album, Kuni assembled a host of talented musicians, including Frankie Banali and Kevin Dubrow from Quiet Riot, Lion's Kal Swan, former Anthrax vocalist Neil Turbin, and bass legend Billy Sheehan.Like Malmsteen, Kuni doesn't quite take full advantage of the guest musicians and vocalists at his disposal. Masque is first and foremost a guitar album, so everything except Kuni's blazing solos get second billing. There are some good songs on the album, but most of the ""songs"" on Masque are just vehicles for extended guitar solos. What's the point of having a guy like Kal Swan on board if you're not going to use him?Ultimately, this pricy Japanese import is really only going to be of interest to serious guitar hero (no, not the game) fans. If you worship Malmsteen, Axel Rudi Pell, and the like, you'll probably love Kuni as well."
4,"Forsyth's best novel, by far ! (contains SPOILERS)","I've read all of Frederick Forsyth's novels, most of them more than once, and this is far and away the best he's ever done.The plot is very plausible, remember it was written during the Cold War confrontation between Thatcher and Reagan on the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other.The smuggling a nuclear device into the UK with the intention of exploding it near a nuclear arms base makes for a very intricate series of events.The false-flag recruitment, and the subsequent chase, from London to South Africa, and back to London, with the professional ""Shadowers"" team, is gripping.The car and motorbike chase for the Soviet spy throughout England, all of it hingeing on a traffic jam, is one of the best I've ever read, even better than most scenes in movies.Most of all, Forsyth's ability to bring all the threads of his novel together at the end, is unparalleled.Thank you, Mr. Forsyth !"
4,Later Printings Better,"I got my copy and have none of the descibed problems of oversaturation of colors, etc... Yes, these are not the original colors, but modern computer coloring and rendered backgrounds, however, they look as good as any current comic. Although I grew up with the originals, I think it is kind of neat seeing them this way. NOTE: Mine is NOT a first edition. Perhaps they corrected the problem with later printings."
2,Erratic viewing,The DVD would stop periodically on one of the DVD players but it worked fine on a newer one. Too bad. Hard to figure out. The film is wonderful. C.
4,Kenneth Branagh delivers a heart wrenching performance.,I loved the interplay between the two WWI vets as they feel each other out and decide whether or not to trust each other. Their relationship provides each one with a subtle healing the is profound and moving. Kenneth Branagh performace was particularly stunning.
4,Brilliant portrayal of post WW1 suffering.,"Amidst a lush, green Yorkshire summer, two emotionally scarred young soldiers Birkin (Colin Firth) and Moon (Kenneth Branagh) endeavour to overcome their invisible fears. Each has their individual work to concentrate on yet both are drawn to each other through a common and terrible bond. Birkin's progress through the summer (and hence the movie) is not only physical, with the gentle subsidence of stutters and tremours, but also emotional, as he allows himself to be drawn in by the locals.A slow moving but ultimately rewarding film with fine performances by the two central actors, in addition to beautiful scenery and gentle dialogue.No fireworks but highly recommended for both fans of Firth and Branagh as well as those with a penchant for classic British cinema."
3,It's interesting.,"I will say that it does have different types of button and switches so it teaches your child about pushing buttons, turning dials, sliding levers, etc. I just wish there was a volume control, because for me it's a little on the loud side. My 1 year old can't do all the buttons on his own, and doesn't play with it much, but maybe when he's older. There are a variety of sounds, which at least holds my interest."
3,A descent supplement,This book was a helpful source of questions. The question structure in this book was actually more similar to what I found on the USMLE than the Kaplan Q bank. The difficulty level of the questions was below expectations. This book strongly stresses epidemiology and very little on actual knowledge base. The explanations were inadequate especially regarding why certain answers were wrong. I did the entire Q bank and found that to be much more helpful.
2,obscure detail,Most of the questions in this book are a waste of time. The Usmle is not going to test you on the relative ratios if LDH1 to LDH2 to LDH3 to LDH4 ... or the most common infection in people named joe with 11 toes and 3 elbows... but this book will. I'm always surprised at the reputation this book has. It is a waste to learn the detail in this book. The best question book is Mock step2 by brochert - You will learn the high yield stuff.
3,The Exiles,"I was very interested in seeing this movie as I'm a product of the Native American LA experience of the 1950's. When it arrived I wasted not time in putting it into my player. The movie was what I expected so I thought I'd watch the second disk. When I went to take it out, it folded into a cd taco. I was bummed."
3,Steam Trains James P. Bell,"Excellent photographs. However, the light gray ink used for print makes it VERY difficult to read. I can understand the selection of this shade from an artists point of view, but it's a pity that those (over 60 year old) who will be most interested will have the poorer eyes. If print were darker, I would given it 5 starts. Otherwise, it is an excellent pictorial work. Mr. Bell is a photographic artist."
5,this chick is crazy different...,"this is a hot blend of pop/hip-hop/r&b. ty really delivers on this album. and her lyrical concepts are soooo real! it's like she's been through everything that we all go through, but she was able to put it on a record and make it entertaining!"
5,Should be required reading in all TX public schools!,"Wow, what a powerful book! Although written from a different perspective, Anderson truthfully and bluntly describes the political ideology of the leaders in 1820 - 1875 Texas. Like it or not, he states the facts behind the privatization of public lands and the extermination of native peoples and animals (bison, etc.). Unfortunately, Texas has become a wasteland of millions of miles of high games fences (No Trespassing) and patchwork of cultivated farmlands that is blowing away with the drouth. Any wonder why it costs about $20/night to enjoy what is left! Maybe having all the West Texas lakes to dry up is not all a bad thing. I would recommend all who enjoy the outdoors to read this book, but maybe not so much the ""sportsmen"" who shoot deer from a stand while they come in to a feeder to eat. If they want real hunting, go West where such political policies were not practiced to the same degree."
2,Calming,"I had used this product for about a year before giving up on it. It didn't help at all with redness or capillaries. However I do use it after going to the dermatologist for IPL treatments to have my capillaries removed. I became tired of waiting for results, and decided to go get the treatments done professionally. I use it for the calming properties it has. It helps soothe the sting, and puffiness that sometimes results from IPL treatments. I'm using it now while I still have product left. I'm sure there are products in the drugstore that I can use for this purpose, so I won't be reordering this in the future. If your broken capillary or redness is really bothering you like it did me, don't waste time suffering, go get it removed by a professional if you can afford to. It's money well spent, unlike this product."
5,Bedrock. Foundation.,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to embark on the serious study of racial idealogy here in America, especially as it pertains to the law. Higginbotham's work is widely quoted and referenced in other books that I've read. This book forms the bedrock and foundation for understanding ""how"" and ""why"" it was necessary to forge a wedge between poor whites and blacks, who together, often conspired to runaway from their master, and how black Americans gradually moved from a position of quasi-servitude to perpetual slavery. This book is phenonmenal. It truly is the bedrock of my collection of works on the subject."
3,After Hilbert Space,"""Polish"" spaces are what follows Hilbert spaces, as night follows day. In a world where fractals and their functional analysis are everywhere, Banach spaces are necessary. Several years ago I reinvented Banach space in my ignorance while studying fractal theory. A book that is both cheap and gives a running shot at learning about this complex graduate level subject is important! I won't say this is an easy book, but for the price it is well worth it as a doorway to a new world of analytical function theory."
5,Beats The Beatles.,"This is way better than anything the Fab Four ever did. -Todd and the boys can compose songs like these in their sleep sitting on their hands, if they wanted to, proving the Liverpool Lads were greatly overrated."
3,reef flip flops,"nothing wrong w/ the product itself but problem with company i ordered from. Package was guaranteed to arrive by xmas, but did not! I had to call company to get merchandise. Sadly, someone was short a gift xmas morning!! I was VERY dissapointed!"
3,Big flop.,"This is a nice looking flip flop. I like the look of the leather. It is fairly comfortable, but Sperry and other brands are better. The foot bed is kinda stiff and hard. It fits well and doesn't ever hurt my feet. It has worn very well too. It has bottle openers on the bottom of the flop, but I have never had to use and don't know how appealing it is to use after walking on it all the time. I would consider buying Reef again, just a different style."
4,Good sandal,"I bought this sandal as a replacement of my old Reef sandal with the flask. Overtime the flask broke down and all the plastic broke out and so I was tired of the ""Crunch"" with every step. Enter the Men's Fanning sandal, with the standard bottle opener in the sole I knew I would never hear ""crunch"" again. The break in period lasted maybe 4 uses and now they glide on and off. Fit is good. I'm a 7.5 -8 in mens and bought the size 8. It seems they are a bit spendy but they will last a very long time with proper care and use."
3,"Looks Nice, but BLISTERS!!!","I'm reviewing the Leather Fannings. I've had the Men's Reef flip flops with the bottle opener for literally the last decade. Everytime I run through a pair I pick up a new one, each performing just as well as the last, until these. I wanted to get the Leather Fanning's because I can wear flip flops to work and they look a little nicer than the standard pair. The look is great and I have no complaints.However, the strap (top, leather piece) of the flip flop has given my feet pretty intense blisters on the sides of my feet. The inside of the strap is not a fabric but leather, and so anytime I've worn them for an entire day I've ripped up the sides of my feet pretty bad. If I wear them for a few hours I'm typically fine, but anything more than that is bad.Overall I'd still recommend the Reef Fannings, just not the leather version."
2,Bad Warranty,"Minimal use over a period of a year. Toe strap broke on one sandal. When I contacted the company about replacement, it was pointed out that the warranty is good for 6 mos only, regardless of use. No more Reefs for me. Other makers have much better warranties."
4,Comfortable,Very comfortable sandals that have lasted through the season and provide a welcome bottle opener. Will buy another pair when they wear out.
5,boys love them,my dog chewed up my older sons blue reef fanning's so i replaced them with this pair. the leather on this pair makes them look so much more expensive then the blue pair he did have. I think he made out by having my dog chew up his old pair. The shoes arrived in three days from the time of order and were better looking in real life.
4,"Comfy, but can't use bottle opener for long...",I wear these regularly... they're comfy but really can only use the bottle opener a couple times before it becomes too nasty.
1,Save yourself the time,"I am a practicing Catholic a college student who is engaged to another practicing catholic and my advice is don't waste your time on this book. We read it as a couple a found many parts of the book completely ridiculous if not offensive. Particularly that parts on sex in marriage and what is and is not appropriate. And the ridiculous sections on pet names to call your husband names such as: ""You big gorilla"". What is ""oversexed"" is this book! Not only was offended personal but my intelligence was also offended, and my sense of humor. But MAINLY this book does a great disservice to the beautiful Catholic teachings on sex, marriage and family. The books I would recommend instead are:Love and ResponsibilityCatechism of the Catholic Church: Second EditionIntroduction to the Theology of the Body: An Adult Faith Formation Program Based on Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body"
3,"Not good, Not Bad.","it's thick really. And can't blame the accuracy as technology changes . There are errors i found , and couldn't resolve. If only he has a support forum , it'll be better . This book expects you to have some knowledge in PHP. And like some say, it's implementation to a website and turorial is little or near to zero.Should include more samples of cases. you have to figure out your own. it's more like a textbook than a self-learn book. It's good for reference. I suggest who is really new ,in PHP - look for other that is easier to read ,and more novice-like.This book should help in your advance to professional stage."
5,The Prayer Chain,"This album captures The Prayer Chain at their best, bittersweet lyrics, sorrowful but hopeful minor guitar chords and crunchy riffs that make you burn in your gut. A must for the Christian who understands pain and redemption and for the pickiest music critic who is tired of cliche' and monotony. If you like your music on the edge pick this one up. My personal favorite is ""Never Enough"". Another great disc by The Prayer Chain is the Whirlpool EP. Let me know what you think."
5,Passionate about Passionate Practice!,"Margret Elson, in her book, Passionate Practice, has provided a step-by-step, well-organized guide for all musicians who are interested in improving their practice and performance. She includes thorough instructions for gaining necessary relaxation, techniques for developing focused concentration, and a helpful procedure to tackle even the most difficult spots successfully. Her encouraging and thoughtful method can be applied from the beginning of learning a piece to its accomplished performance and always with the aim of personal musical expressivity. Delightful cartoons illustrate many of Ms. Elson's points and, together with her handy checklists, this book is both practical and insightful."
5,Useful and funny!,"This book is full of practical advice about life's most important subject -- having a good time. And it's all done on a budget, a must if you're living as an underemployed bon vivant -- and who isn't these days? The author packs a lot of information into this book with wit and style. His flare for observations about the partying lifestyle made me laugh out loud. The book is worth buying even just for the section on how to throw a party and get free booze out of it -- and for the tips on how to get drunk people out of your apartment! A great, quick read full of useful information."
3,Irish Traditional Cooking : Over 300 Recipes from Ireland's,"`Irish Traditional Cooking' is full of Ireland's favorite dishes served in the homes and restaurants of the `Emerald Isle.' It's a wonderful introduction to traditional Irish cooking, which includes various sections on recipes and those not so familiar with their ingredients and cooking. The book includes gorgeous photos, as a perfect compliment to Irish cooking."
2,I am new but...,"even I knew evertthing in this book. It is very pretty with lots of big pictures but if you are looking for something with a little more meat to it, look elsewhere."
4,"Less Pregnancy Than You Expect, More Sex","I expected this to be more focused on the the main character's pregnancy - you know, your typical chick lit pregnancy book. I was surprised to find the book read more like a steamy (emphasis on steamy) romance with pregnancy as one of the background stories. McCarthy can write a good sex scene for sure, but while I enjoyed the build up and the suspense, some of it rang false for me. I wanted more plot and more secondary characters. I think what was missing for me was the chick part. There wasn't a lot of interaction with her friends and there certainly wasn't enough shopping! I still recommend it though and think it's a good entry into the pregnancy/chick lit field. This is a good book to enjoy with a hot bath and your bunny slippers when you need a hot love story to warm you up. McCarthy is skilled at writing a good romance."
4,Good Read,"This book was very interested and a good read. However I was very disappointed at the ending, I felt like the author just left you hanging at the end. I even went online to see if there was a part II to this one but there wasn't."
4,Good reference to get you thinking,I read through a lot of the book when I bought it then chose certain chapters to re-read when I had my carport built. Without this book I don't think I would have gotten a lawyer to review the contract and I'm really glad I did. I tend to just trust what people tell me which is not always a good idea obviously. The book caused me to get very specific details written into the contract and to renegotiate some of the terms they said were their standard terms. I think I'll pull the book out again anytime I have work done on the house.
4,A Pleasant Surprise!!!!!!!,This was a welcome surprise when I thought this band was all but gone forever. The music is solid and the musicians are great and suggest that this band will soldier on for a long time. Sonic Orgami is also fantastic. Long live the Heap!!
1,Terrible book,I'm really stunned by the reviews this book has gotten here. I've tried a few of the recipes and not only were they not especially quick they were not good at all. It strikes me as a cookbook for people who don't know how to cook and don't know much about good food.
5,The Dinner Doctor!,"This lady can make a meal out of a mess!! She has wonderful ideas to throw together a good dinner, usually just by using the stuff around the house. Tastes like gourmet food. Gave me some new ideas for dinner, what every mother needs to spice up the dinner table. Easy, tasty recipes. Worth purchasing."
2,Dinner Doctor Misses the Mark,"I LOVE the Cake Mix and Chocolate Cake Mix Doctor cookbooks - they are truly wonderful and several recipes are now go-to family ""classics"" we use over-and-over. Given that, I had high expectations when I received the Dinner Doctor Cookbook. I've had it now for about two years and can say it has truly disappointed. The recipes don't really appeal to everyone, they're more complicated than they should be, and considering there are other alternatives out there (30 Minute Meals, Robin Miller, etc.), this book just disappoints."
5,So Easy and Delicious! Another Fantastic Book By Anne Byrn!,"I have both of the Cake Mix Doctor books, and when I discovered Anne Byrn had a Dinner Doctor book out, I knew I had to purchase it. Every single recipe I have tried from all of her books has turned out to be fantastic and sooooo easy! Just the other day, from the Dinner Doctor book, I made a wonderfully rich and easy chicken casserole dish that uses canned artichokes, canned mushrooms, sour cream, mayonnaise, and curry powder. Talk about luscious! And all of her recipes use ingredients that can easily be found in your supermarket. I don't have to worry about trying to find a specialty food shop.I hear she has a new cupcake book out now - you can bet I will purchase that book from Amazon to add to my Anne Byrn recipe collection!"
2,Disappointing at best,"I really tried to like this cookbook but the recipes are hit or miss at best. Mom's pot roast with Vidalia onion gravy was a different spin on your every day pot roast. The Souffleed Sweet Potatoes were excellent but the other recipes were awful. The recipes were both bland and time-consuming. Popcorn Soup sounded like a fun idea until you are eating soggy, tough popcorn in your corn chowder. As for the Southern Cranberry Salad, suffice it to say, it was thrown out before my guests could have it for Thanksgiving.For a cookbook, the layout of the book is poor. There should be concise instructions for the cooking part. In this book there is so much extraneous verbiage on the page that it is difficult to follow the recipe. In all, a good premise with poor execution."
4,the Dinner Doctor,"Gave the book as a christmas gift, she said that she Loved it. the others at the party wants it also. I think I have created a monster. Now everyone wants the book also, I guess that I know what the birthday & other presents will be."
1,HOW COME IT AIN'T MADE IN AMERICA ???????,"I have learned one thing about Amazon you don't buy AMERICAN made products. Before I bought this from you I asked 3 different people if the toaster was made in AMERICA and they all said yes. So I bought it an when I received it had a seal on the bottom that said made in china was I upset....So now I put you in the same class as walmart that is selling JUNK..I would think we the AMERICAN people would be sick of supporting these people that would love to take over the great land of ours,and the companys in the U.S.A. DON'T seem to get it,WAKE UP PLEASE WAKE UP...Ron a very unhappy camper................"
3,Toaster,"The Toaster looks very nice, but it doesn't do any better than any others I have.On large pieces of bread, it doesn't allow the bread to be completely into the toaster.Depending on the bread, sometimes it is light and sometimes it is dark.It takes a lot of time to toast the bread also."
3,Good nutritional profile; average taste.,"I am always looking for nutrition snack bars that will help me refuel after workouts, curb between meal hunger pangs, and hopefully, taste great, too! I was encourged by the nutritional profile of the Zone Perfect bar, and I decided to give the Fudge Graham variety a try. This bar comes in at 210 calories, with 7 grams of fat (4 saturated, 0 trans), 21 grams carbs, 1 gram fiber, and an excellent 16 grams protein. The Fudge Gramam flavor has a nice texture--sort of like a Rice Crispie treat--and is covered in a fudge coating, but this had a bit of an artificial taste to me. In addition, I didn't detect any graham flavor, which I found disappointing. The bar did taste good, but I've also had better (the Pria Complete Peanut Butter Crunch are really delicious!), and I would've liked to see more fiber as well. Overall, this is not a bad choice, but keep in mind that there may be better options available."
4,There's a Crisis in China and it ain't so bad.,"Doesn't this album remind one of that obscure 80's English pop group China Crisis? It did for me when I played this and one of their albums back to back reecently. Not that this is a bad thing. Good production values. Nice ""layered"" pop sound.If you like this I think his cut on the Roaring Lambs CD in a duet with Ginny Owens stands out both musically and lyrically. very compatible with this album.Sure wish he'd produce more of his own albums rather than producing for other people."
2,not working right,"Even it says Canon but the one that I bought can't hold charge like my original battery. The one that came with the camera can stay up weeks without use. This one drain out after a few days in the camera. If I take picture inside with flash on, this battery will die after about 30 shots. I suggest you go with the cheaper non-canon one to save your money."
1,Bootleg Knock Off Battery,Thank you Game Expo for selling me this bootleg knock off battery. This battery had half the life of a REAL canon nb-4l battery. I leave soon for a vacation and I wont even be able to get a new battery in time online. What a waste!
5,Great product,"Arrived on time, fits the camera and also came with charge on it!Need a spare one in case the main dies.. And its better to be original!"
5,They are weird. Another good factoid book,"This book is in multiple cartoon styles. It's front to back with some of history's greatest weirdos. If you haven't tried one of the ""Big Book of..."" books, you should. If you get hooked, you'll get more.Enjoy"
2,Great but does not hold up!!,"I purchased two of these dryers. One dryer glowed red hot after 8 months. I threw it out. I purchased another one and the plastic tabs that hold the dryer on the base broke. Customer service was horrible!!! They practically accused me of breaking it myself. The representative said that she owned one and my problem never happened to her. Anyway, after calling back I spoke with another woman who said to mail the dryer at my expense($9.00) and they would send me another dryer. Well I received the dryer yesterday, plugged it in and the plug popped and blew the circuit in the bathroom. I am almost certain they sent a refurbished piece of junk!!! Buyer beware!"
3,Its OK,Feels cheap but works OK. Bought this to replace old one but model feels cheaper. last one lasted less than 2 years.
4,Convenient Hair Dryer,"We've owned three of this model hair dryer now. The first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1/2 years. That's roughly $6/year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model. That and the fact that the mount is already on the wall. Of course, we still have our backup hair dryer which is a Gillette Pro-Max that I received 30+ years ago when I was sixteen. That one is still going strong."
5,a good book to curl up with,"I definitely liked this book! When I first bought it I was expecting something Chicken Soup-like, which was true; but I think I actually enjoyed it more than most of the Chicken Soup books I read, even the ones for the Teenage Soul. I noticed that some of the stories in this book were already in more than one Chicken Soup book I've read. I enjoyed almost all the other stories though, they were well written and I think they were good choices to put in the book. I really felt like I could relate to some of them and they truly touched me. Teens who like Chicken Soup will like this one too."
1,Too dull to finish,"Ben Witherington III is no N T Wright.This book is dull and drags with grammatical structure that would never pass a basic English class.BW III writes from a vantage point of assumed superiority; he is unable to connect with the reader.From my vantage point, this book and most of his other books as well are a poor usage of our world's precious resources.Save the trees."
2,Save you money,Save your money and buy the Philips SHS3200/37. Price range $10-$15 depending on where you go. They stay in the ear better and in my opinion have just as good if not better sound quality.
5,Fits the purpose,"I bought these ear buds to replace the inadequate set that came with my Creative Zen Nano Plus mp3 which, by the way, is an awesome value. I listen to music when I mow the lawn, spin on my trainer or mountain bike. These earbuds are great! They stay in place in spite of the perspiration that builds up during a workout which when combined with any movement causes most earbuds to slip out of place. The green color does not bother me in the least. Actually it makes my mp3 easier to find when I am getting ready for a workout. There is ample cord length. The ear bud design works. I was pleased with the sound quality. I would buy them again if the need arose."
1,not for small ears,"I have smallish ears and ear canals and can't use these things. I'd had a set of MX-75 for 1.5 years which were a decent fit , good sound quality and good for workouts as sweat didn't seal them as all other buds I'd tried did. The 75's were retired when the wires had broken right outside the plug, the self-tangling cords were an irritant, too much twist, too sticky! but they had survived ~500 uses. So I'd assumed that these would have the same size transducer cage and roughly the same fit , but apparently not. the OMX-70s have a larger metal cage and won't go into my ear properly even with the ear clip's rotation, extension and springiness . Phooey!"
1,Junky Expensive Headset,Hate it. The sound quality would probably be great if the earbud would stay in my ear. When I am jogging my left earpiece demand constant attention. I am now just starting my jog with the left earpiece inside my shirt.
1,"The cord is WAY too long for portable players,",and the cord started shorting out on me for no good reason.
3,Ear Problems,I have trouble with any kind of pods. I think my head needs full headphones. But that is not the best way to travers the streets. So I will adapt. They did stay on better than most. The sound was full and most excellent.
1,My recommendation is not to buy these,"The arms that go around the back of your ears are too soft/flimsy to hold them in position, and the earbuds are a little too large to fit into your ears (my ears are average) so they do not stay in place.It's annoying to have to reposition your headphones during athletic activity."
2,"Good sound, horrible fit!","I thought that the over-the-ear design would be the way to go for a pair of gym earphones, but I've found that it's more of a hindrance than a help. The ear buds always come out of my ears - sure, the over-the-ear arm keeps them sitting ON my ear but without the buds being right into your ear canal, you get no bass. This results in a very washed out, tinny sound.If you hold them in your ear (or if you're not moving), then they sound great - but unfortunately, my experience (over about six months) is that they just don't fit properly. The over-the-ear arm puts the ear buds at the wrong angle, which makes them pop out. I suspect the twist-to-fit MX75 ear buds -Sennheiser MX75 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Sport Headphones- would be a better purchase.I would not buy these again."
2,Poor wiring,Wiring became exposed within first 2 months... to bad because the sound quality was pretty good.I wouldn't but these again because of the poor quality.
3,Headphones for jogging,"I thought that the design of these headphones was brilliant in that they would wrap around your ears and not pop out while jogging. Well, they don't actually fall to my shoulders like the earbuds did, but the actual speaker does still pop out and the ear wrap piece twists while I run. The sound quality is great, but the design leaves a little to be desired."
3,GOOD TRAILER - BAD JOGGER!!!!,"I bought this about a year ago, I only have 1 child who is now 4 years old. When we use it as a jogger, it is extremely hard to make turns in, but I knew it would be before I bought it because I was aware of the ""jogger"" stroller structures. Most joggers have non-swivle front wheels. But I think with something as big as this trailer it should have a swivle wheel in front. As a bike trailer, I have found no complaints! WORKS GREAT! As for other complaints about tires warping and air deflation, maybe your kid or kids are too big for it, that could be causing the problems. My son is 4 and weighs 40pounds, works fine. I only paid $100 for mine brand new! You cant beat it for that price!!! Son loves it, I enjoy using it and spending quality time with my son while getting the exercise I need!"
3,Great bike attachemtn....NOT a jog stroller,"I really think Little Tikes should take out the fact that it can be used as a jogging stroller. If you are buying it for THAT, go with a B.O.B. or something similar. This is really a bike trailer. As a trailer, it's really sturdy, roomy, and fits my 3 & 5 year old boys fine. I always thought the 3rd wheel attachment was in case you HAD to push this thing for a minute, similar to a ""spare tire."" I had no idea it was being advertised as a jogging stroller. It's bulky & not easy to get in and out of your car on a regular basis,etc."
3,Sudden price hike,"Amazingly, after reading all these enthusiastic reviews, I dumped it in my shopping cart. And guess what, within 6 hours the price went up with US$ 110.00. My, my..I have to start searching all over. Two stars off to get the attention to this strange practice. I am sure I would have had something nice to report about the machine. I refer to the other reviewers for that."
5,great toy,"I bought this toy when Amazon had it deeply discounted. It was well worth it. My 1 year old son loves it. Has been chasing it since he could crawl. We had difficulty with the figure`s screw, so we ended up just leaving the bottom part of the figure off. It does not sit in the truck firmly but at least sits in it. It captures my son`s attention for a long time and amuses him. He puts the shapes in the back, and picks them up after they are dumped. Our truck runs great on carpet. And we especially like the fact that it takes off on its own twice after the driver is pushed, and dumpes the shapes out twice. I would buy it again."
5,The Elite few...,"Not the first book,but certainly one of the best,Eddings has acheived the status : Elite. I read this book during my lunch breaks, ( I was always late returning to work). It was delightful to have a dining room full of people look my way when i could no longer hold back my mirth at some witty comment made by one of the char's, and burst out laughing....Extremely delightful!! Thank you David for putting some humor back into life!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Magic boy takes control.With grumpy old wizard Belgarath and daughter out of action due to overindulgence in magic keeping everyone in one piece, it is up to Gation to be head mojo maker.Not only that, but this farm boy seems to have grown up to be a sorcerer and a king (don't injure your eyes rolling them, here).The whole king thing is maybe not so cool when you find out you have to fight a god, even with a princess with the hots for you and the army she has put together.2 out of 5"
4,The first real suprises of the series,"Eddings gets better and better as we follow the journey of young Garion toward his battle with Torak. In ""Castle or Wizardry"" our young hero reaches the end of the quest for the Orb of Aldur only to discover his greatest challenge lies ahead. He will be put in a position so far beyond his humble beginnings that his mind will reel. In the meantime the company of heroes we've followed through the first three books face very different challenges in the days leading to war with the powers of the East. The most daunting task is set for Ce'Nedra in a twist you may not see coming. Mysteries are revealed and new adventures begun. This is a great addition to an epic that will remain a favorite for a long time to come."
5,FANTastic ANTics,ANTicipate a fANTastic read. No ANTiquated ABC book here. ANTics is a great ANTitoxin for boring alphabet books. Fun and imaginative. Great addition to my alphabet book collection.
2,Nothing Special,These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced. I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality. The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims. These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss. I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada. Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much. My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they didn't approve it. It seems they screen all their reviews and if they don't like what the customer has written they will not publish it. I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and don't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them. If it wasn't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice.
5,Excellent read,What children don't dream of being a hero in the eyes of their family and friends? In this adventure Alexander and his fearless dragon fly off into the starry night to visit a castle where they are welcomed by the fairies and their king. But meanwhile the ogres and trolls are ravaging the town. Can Alexander and his dragon fight off the monsters and save their friends? This is a fun read for young children. The illustrations are colorful and not too scary for the targeted age group...and they're going to love the dragon!
5,""" Outstanding """,As a Christian this book is almost as important a read as is the Bible and Amazon having this book at the ready was such a blessing. The book was in perfect condition and although a hard book to read it has brought so much into my personal relationship with God.
4,Bizzaro entertaining beautifully illustrated some technique,"Not a practical guide (despite the title). Learn! How to sleep without sleeping, the correct way to point your mustache, how often to have sex with your wife and when, and a little note here and there on which colors to use and how to draw.The best thing about this book are the illustrations (mostly pen and ink) which are amazing and reveal the true mastery of technique Dali had. He idolized Valasquez and thought his fellow modern artists were hacks. Picasso (fellow Spaniard) -- talented but misguided. Realism is the goal. That and flat paintings (look at the canvas at an angle to make sure your brush strokes aren't building up any ridges of paint).Worth $10 fursure."
4,hilarious comedy,"Hollywood Shuffle is a spoof of many of the 'blaxploitation' films of the seventies. This was hollywood's introduction to Robert Townsend, as he wrote and starred in the film, reportedly financing it with credit cards.Townsend stars as an actor trying to break into the bigtime. He finds it tough to break out of the hollywood ideas for black actors. The movie sends up several popular films, including Dirty Harry and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Be sure to look for the Siskel and Ebert parody.Not very deep, and probably not for those who can't laugh at themselves. Some of the humor might be considered insensitive. I consider it hilarious."
4,Easy 5 stars if DVD had any extras,This movie is an all time classic. A great 'craft' movie made on Visa Card budgets. Funny throughout. Would have been given 5 stars if the company had blessed us with any extras.
5,Great,"Got in time to wrap for Christmas. Thanks for making it easy & affordable. No problems so far, look forward to getting to watch them myself."
4,"If you liked ""Hair of the Dog"" & ""Razamanaz"" buy this!!","Wow! Just when you thought that the band was long past their prime, they come back with the rocking fury of their 70's power updated by Billy Rankin's modern metal guitar stylings. The opening tune is the best thing they have recorded since ""Telegram"".A lot of the 80's material put out by Nazareth was very poor, but this CD is right up with ""Hair of the Dog"" and ""Razamanaz"". Well worth buying! The rockers rock hard, the mid tempo tunes are fun and the ballads are excellent."
1,Platitudes and Fluff,"I recently took a translation course that used this as a textbook. If you are an instructor, please don't do that to your students. This handbook does not provide approaches or techniques that improve translation quality for your students. There are no exercises, examples, or pointers on how one language differs from another in structure or style. No language or translation theory is even introduced. It simply rehashes the same platitudes and fluff year after year (and even the same typos) in so-called updated versions."
1,A waste of trees and money,"This handbook did not teach me anything i already didn't know. Morry Sofer frankly is an unreliable source when it comes to translating. For a book made up predominantly of appendices, there is no real valuable or vital information the reader can attain for his 25 dollars. In all honesty...Not worth a single penny."
4,Refresher for entrenched advisors,"This book was a fast and convenient way to revitalize my personal and professional mission and vision and then translate that to my practice. Very profound and affirming results! Would like to check out the author's PEAK solution but his salesmen stopped calling once I asked for references and told him I was going to read the book before spending $4,000 on their program. After reading the book I think I can see why. It's all here and if you can't work your way through the book's worksheets then you probably aren't going to use $4,000 of PEAK self-help materials either.... Do the book then take a look at his PEAK program."
2,Class of nuke em high 3,This second sequel to Class of nuke em high is a disappointment.CONEH 3 has very little to do with the original and if you've seen the Toxic Avenger sequels you'll find that this is more like the second than the first.The film picks up exactly where the second ended and even borrows scenes from the second in fact the begining is just a recap of the second.This film is really bad and I would have rated it lower but after viewing it again I found it to be a little better.If you loved the first you won't like this that much and if you don't like Troma then you will want to destroy this tape.
4,"Not his best work, but still better than other artists' work","""Let Mercy Lead"", the second track, has to be one of Rich's finest songs of all time.I have all of Rich's work on CD, except the soundtrack of ""Canticle"". If you are only buying one Rich Mullins' CD today, Brother's Keeper wouldn't be the first one I would recommend you get, but do get it! If you only are going to buy 5 or 6 of Rich's CDs, include this one!"
4,too expensive,I love these I just wish I could find them cheaper. They came quickly . The box was slightly damaged but the paper was fine inside
1,Very poor design,"Bought this at a home Depot. The power was ok, but the design makes it easy to malfunction and hard to repair. Later, I bought a Stanley and it was great. It was easier to load, had a better safety features. Now the I compare the two, the Stanley blows the Arrow away."
2,Trash,"I'm not a hater. I lyked Paris's other book but this one is worthless. It's just another way for her to make money. Its pretty much a blank diary with a few tips she didn't even write. And Paris is starting to fade out, shes kind of a has been now."
3,some good moments,"foregoing Bauhaus's spooky dark rock, Love And Rockets created a glammy street rock goth with some Elvis worship and a hint of psychadelia. there's a delicious buzzing drone throughout these songs that give it a nice slippery trashy appeal. as a whole, this album is skittery and off balance, but it contains some great little singles like ""No Big Deal"", ""Motorcycle"", and the surprise hit of ""So Alive."""
1,no flow..no go,"This was the one that really let the boys down. After the heights of 7th dream and Express, the previous album Earth,Sun,Moon had hinted that the quality control was beginning to slip. It sounds like a selection of J + ash solo album tracks and they appeared to have little input on each others efforts. This is a shame really since the dual harmonies and interwined songwriting is what made it happen in the first placeSo if your looking for a place to start with Love and Rockets avoid this opt for either Express or 7th dream"
2,much sound and fury signifying little,"This book was scheduled to be discussed at a Harvard Master Class, so I was looking forward to reading it before attending. Being a musician also added to my anticipation of a fascinating experience of literature. The protagonist, obsessed with Glenn Gould, suffered from ocd - and, unfortunately, so does the reader by the time he or she is finished with it. Rather than an empathic connection to the character, whose monolgue seems interminable and repetitious, this reader wanted to toss the book out the nearest window, despite its pedigree."
4,Not by Sir Winston Churchill -- Still awfully good,"Book was written by Winston Churchill, an American from St Louis. He also wrote The Crossing, The Crisis, and a number of others. Richard Carvel may be his best. Highly recommended."
3,Perfect part,"Unfortunately it arrived a few days after the car had a fatal failure, so I did not get to use it. The part was in a Nisan Bag on a Ford box and so it is doubly the right part for the Quest and Villager."
2,Not such great traction,"I've had good luck with Continental Gatorskins and Grand Prix tires (high end), but I decided to save some money on my last tire purchase, so I went with the Ultra Sports. I haven't had an unusual number of flats, but I don't think they grip very well. On my last ride, I had to cover about 100 yards on gravel, and when I returned to the concrete surface, I wiped out when I stood on a short incline, and my rear tire spun out. Luckily, I was not on a fast descent, banking into a steep corner. Admittedly, these tires had two seasons of wear on them, so I might have been pushing them beyond their expected wear. They probably picked up some dust from the gravel, too. Regardless, I can't remember ever having that happen to me before on a road bike. I swapped them out for a new pair of Grand Prixs that afternoon. I don't mind compromising comfort or convenience when I buy an economy product, but I don't want to risk my safety."
4,Good tire,This is a great tire for the price. I was going through tires like crazy (I live in a college town and the streets are always littered with broken bottles) and I have had these for a while now and no flats.
3,Groan!!!,"I disliked this book, the heroine was wonder woman!! She was flawless. She could sew a mattress, make gormet meals out of nothing, clean your pig sty of a house this afternoon and serve the perfect meal at seven. Oh please!!! The only thing I did like was the first few pages and her love affair of the last few pages which certainly did not atone in my opinion for a tiresome book (oh alright there were some good spiritual truths imparted). Ms Hill did write some very good books, in my opinion this was not one of them!"
1,a shadow of becoming modern,"I second the sentiments of the New York Times reviewer ' the anecdotes here, many of which seem merely to have been cribbed from Carolyn Burke's recent biography of Loy, read more like a book report than a reinvention of the events and people portrayed"""
3,Adv Dancers,This is a great book of adv dancers. Not for someone just starting out. Lots of step/words listed here are never taught/used in normal studio programs and may be over some dancers' heads. But it's very informational if you know what the steps are calls.
4,Great book. Really focuses on things you should know,this book has all tha awnsers. dont know what a pod-aduex is? its all in here.
4,Good product,"This product served its purpose, the only thing is that it is a little itchy. Other than that it is a good product."
2,wrong length for skirt,I have not worn the crinoline yet. I does not match the poodle skirt on amazon in length or fullness. I have to get a new crinoline for the poodle skirt. I think it would be nice for the right dress.
2,cheap quality,"I like the crinoline, but it is cheap quality. I would have paid$15.00 at the most for it. It is a costume quality and even sayscostume on the bag. It is not a hand made item. I expected more."
5,"Lost Charger, Now Camera has complete package","I was looking for a charger everywehere and I found this charger online. The only kind I could find in stores was Universal and the cost started at $45+. This was a great deal, it shipped fast and works just like the original I bought when I purchased my camera bundle package."
2,Battery Charger,"I got sent the actual battery instead of the charger, even though i ordered the charger. I dont need the battery so did i just spend my money for nothing?"
1,replacement for defective battery charger for ixus 70,"This is actually a replacement for the original which mysteriously stopped working after 3 months of minimal usage. Way too complicated to go through the Canon warranty process being that I bought the Ixus 70 in France and am now in Australia for 6 months. This one works, so far so good."
1,Item not actually available.,"I tried to order this item in January. It is now March and despite the fact that the item says ""usually ships in 24 hours"" it still has not shipped. If you need this battery charger I suggest buying it elsewhere. I've been in touch with Amazon Custom Service to no avail. I'll post again if anything changes."
3,Poor shipping....,It took 16 days for me to get this item. Amazon emailed me saying that the shipping date would be delayed due to stock issues. In the email they also told me I could cancel me order if I wanted. I immediately tried to cancel my order but was not able to as amazon says the item is expected to ship soon and the order cannot be canceled. Poor service!!!!!!!!
1,defective item,"This camera battery charger was defective. Very disappointing, since I needed it for a trip I had planned.Now I have to deal with the hassle of returning it /paying shipping & handling in order, hopefuly, get my money back...sooon.I ended up going to Best Buy to buy a new one."
1,RIGHT PACKAGING BUT WRONG PRODUCT INSIDE. NOT IMPRESSED,"You had the wrong battery charger in the correct packaging. Your packaging says Canon CB-2LV, but your battery charger is the Canon CB-2LZ. NOT IMPRESSED. I will order directly from Canon and never use these guys again. If there were an option for zero stars I would have chosen that one."
2,battery charger,"Product was said to be new and was not, also battery does not securely stay in charger. With that being said it works and price was good that's about all."
1,The charger does not work,The charger that was sent is broken. I need to get instruction to send it back
3,Lost my old one.,"I figured these were ancient technology by now since I've had my camera for 7-8 years or so. Price was steeper than I was expecting/wanting, but also wanted to continue to use my camera since it was working fine. Looks and works like the original."
5,Got exactly what was advertised,"I recently lost the battery charger to my camera, so I was very glad when I found this charger for sale. It came In the mail a few days after I ordered it and is exactly like the one that I had lost. There are no annoying cords to mess with, just a fold out plug on the back. I matched up the details on the charger with those on my battery and it is perfect. I'm very happy with the product I received."
4,it was what i ordered,We lost the battery charger the weekend we bought the camera. We found this one on-line and it works well. Have had no issues or problems with it.
5,Canon Battery Charger,"Perfect! I had lost the battery charger that came with my camera and could not find the same Canon charger at Bestbuy, fortunately I found the identical charger on Amazon. I received the charger right when they said a few days later and so far the charger has been working great. It charges your battery fully in about two to three hours. It shows a red light when the battery is not fully charged and a green light when it is completely charged. The prongs fold in perfectly and it is conveniently small for travel. Its very easy to use and plugs right into your wall. Thanks Amazon."
4,"Fun, old fashioned...","good for practicing stitching with small child (age 3). Cardboard items are slightly thinner than ideal, but sufficient. Fun for a couple of afternoons but my daughter lost interest fast."
5,Your worst fears confirmed,"The only book on the subject availible, and long overdue. Elaine DePrince writes from the heart, with a sharp eye for contradictions. Though it is a personal story of pain and loss, anyone who reads it can not come away without a sense of outrage. It is a story that should have been writen ten years ago about a forgotten group forced into the battle against HIV?AIDS unarmed and unprepared, but continues to fight back to the last man and woman if necessary. Every health care worker, doctor, and politician should read this, and if it doesn't scare them silly, they are not paying attention."
5,what did the Swiss give us?,Great stuff from director Carol Reed.The sense of mystery that is generated around the character of Harry Lime is terrific and Harry's first appearance on camera is one of the stand out scenes in the history of cinema.Anton Karras's marvellous music adds greatly to the atmosphere.Brilliant from start to finish.
2,Poor transfer from Criterion,Usually reliable Criterion here does a great disservice to a classic movie. The dark mood created by Robert Krasker's famous black and white photography is wrecked by a transfer that is too bright and without the proper contrast. Those who remember the great look of this movie from seeing it in the theatre will be disappointed.
4,Great Classic Movie for one Who Is not Into Old Movies,"I'm not a huge fan of classical movies, but this is a great script and was shot well. I definately need to watch more classic movies and this is one reason to do so. On top of that a great addition to a book lover is the book version of this movie in audio form to go with the movie. Genius. I would buy it just for that alone."
5,Impressive,"A fantastic story (Graham Greene wrote the screenplay), terrific acting and first-class cinematography (full of camera shots that are utterly riveting) make The Third Man a must-see classic. The score is a little heavy-handed and obtrusive at times, but almost sixty years after its release, The Third Man remains a masterpiece."
3,review,this version came out on the dark side for the night scenes. still a great movie. thought I was buying a dvd but for the price vhs is good enough
2,Why the hoopla?,"I just do not understand why people like this film. The plot is incoherent, the music makes your skin crawl, and I'm not so hot on the acting either. Like another reviewer stated, it seems more of an ego trip for Orson Wells than anything else. So what? So they run through the streets and underground of Vienna using odd camera angles, lighting, and that annoying zither music. I have tried to like this film. Sorry, can't do it.Lucky"
2,There's something about you guys that I don't understand,"I just don't like this movie, and I can't understand why everyone says it's a classic. It's totally uncinematic. The whole story is told through dialogue. The cinematography is fancy all right, but its fanciness is hardly necessary. The movie doesn't even really need an audience, because it finds its own story much more interesting than I ever thought it was. Joseph Cotten comes to Vienna immediately finding his friend dead, hit by a car. Before you can blink, he's obsessed with finding out the details of the incident and turns into a regular Philip Marlowe. The movie treats Harry Lime's death as if it's as important as the death of president Kennedy, AND WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN QUICKLY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE! COULD IT HAVE BEEN...GASP! MURDER! Who cares?"
1,Flimsy,"I purchased this mandolin based on the one my mother has owned for the past 15 years, still in great shape, by the same maker. This mandolin is a large disappointment. After only using it twice the plastic underneath that holds the different blades broke off. Then it cracked in the plastic near the handle. The safety holder is also flimsy and is difficult to keep the items being sliced in place. It is poorly made and certainly not anywhere near the quality of the one my mother owns."
5,Another Jewel for Renee,Fleming has such a beautiful voice. Her audience always receives a special treat(as if she were singing only for them).The selections let each listener share and become a part of this artistic work.The experience from the initial selection;to receipt of the actual work...was without a flaw and makes me look for other items by this seller. A-1 servics...
1,It didn't work.,The Renee Fleming Blue-Ray failed to work though the other two blue-Rays purchased at the same time worked well. How do I have it replaced?
3,Great book... crummy editing,"Like the first book - The Gathering Storm - this is part a wonderful history of the Second World War. Other reviews of this Kindle edition have remarked about the typos. Believe them! The typos are great in number and just plain foolish. They are as if the book was copied from a handwritten manuscript by someone who was not entirely familiar with the english language. I love these books, and will finish them. I am, however, considering purchasing hard copies rather than push through this sludge of typos. In truth, I have only completed a third of this second book. The Gathering Storm had no typos to speak of. This one's a wreck. It does diminish the experience."
3,TYPOS,Not the fault of the author. Winston is magnificent. But this edition is filled with hideous typos. Is there a cleaner edition available?
1,Charts and tables are unreadable,"This is probably one of the best books I ever read. However, the Kindle version has low res charts and tables that are unreadable, even when zoomed. So, in the kindle version you lose all the diagrams that are there to help you understand the great battles. I strongly suggest you buy the paper edition."
4,The Colour of His Hair,The Colour of His Hair takes you into a world so often experienced by gay men. Author David Rees successfully manages to make you care about the characters and not the colour of their life.I highly recommend this as an easy read.
1,Waste of money,"The actual game, worms armageddon can work on windows 7. This is not made by team 17, this is some flash player installation program which does not work. You have to explore the disc to find the .exe and tinker with it to get the installation going. Once installed, the game will not open because the way they created this disc it is incompatible to play on windows 7. If you are using an operating system more modern than windows 98, do not waste your money on this seller."
5,Wonderful Video! Will help your child learn sight words.,I have a 6 year old who has really struggled to learn to read. She has no desire to and it's like pulling teeth to get her to try. I purchased this video and the sight word cards and after watching it one time she knew over half the words. It was amazing. I would definitely recommend this video and have already ordered the other two to go with the flash cards.
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I would recommend this CD to anyone! Michael W. Smith has an amazing way of turning out such wonderful songs. Some of my favorites are... Angels Unaware, Cry For Love and Straight To The Heart. I also love what he has done with As It Is In Heaven. I think it is absolutely beautiful and I listen to it every time I feel that my faith is being tested and it always makes me feel better. I would just like to say Congrats to Michael W. Smith for becoming such a sucess and encourage him to keep the wonderful hits coming!"
5,This is awesome...,"I own many of Michael W. Smith's albums and am familiar with almost all of them. I would have to put this on the short list of my best albums.There are many tracks that I absolutely love. ""Cry for Love"" is a solid start and ""As It Is in Heaven,"" ""Someday,"" and the title track are outstanding. But the high point of the album is the Trilogy, Tracks 8-10. I think that all three of those songs are musically beautiful and lyrically powerful. Quite honestly, the Trilogy is worth the price of the album. And it concludes with several other good songs, like ""Calling Heaven"" and ""I""m Waiting for You.""I would never accuse Smith of having a glorious voice. However, I consider him to be the most brilliant songwriter of modern Christian music and a wonderful musician. This album is a true testament to his remarkable gifts. I listen to it often and recommend it to anyone."
3,Nice pictures but casual information,"There are a lot of great pictures and the writing about increase of ospreys and general life history is good. Sometimes the information is sparse, for example, he mentions osprey ""Colonies"", but they are not colonial like seabirds or wading birds. A distribution map of wintering range and breeding range would have helped. There are occasional anthropomorphisms, such as ""ospreys are relatively taciturn as they go about the business of providing for their family"". Under his chapter on ""Osprey and you"" it should have been mentioned that permits are usually needed to remove osprey nests, and also fishermen can assist by making sure tangled fishing lines are removed."
2,Disappointing,"I am a diehard Raymond Feist fan, have read everything he's written, so I think I have the perspective to say this is NOT his best stuff. I really felt he phoned this one in. The man who brought us Pantathian Serpent priests is now resorting to vampires as villans?! How pedestrian! This work was far less imaginative than any of his previous books. I really began to wonder if perhaps Mr. Feist has run out of gas with regard to storylines for the world of Midkemia (I hope not!). With the success of his video games perhaps his focus is less on writing these days and more on other creative pursuits. This book did have the feel of a video game. Every couple of pages the 'good guys' did battle with 'bad guys' and after awhile it got quite tiresome. Where the political intrigue and finely drawn characters that make his earlier work so engrossing? Mr. Feist is a master of creating believable worlds but he just took us to a very boring corner of this one."
2,Going through the motions,"Feist's story line has become derivative and it appears he has joined Clancy in losing interest in pleasing a devoted audience. I am amazed at the amount of repetitive phrases he uses in this book (how many times did James almost lose his head; how often did he sidestep to have two opponents get in each other's way?). As I recall, in ""Magician"" and his other earlier work there were a number of underlying plots and twists. This book could not have been more predictable. Actually, the ""trilogy"" could have been one book. But then we wouldn't have had to read three novellas and pay for all three."
3,Krondor Lite for the easily bored reader,"There's nothing inherently BAD about the Riftwar Legacy books, they're just not great either. They are ideal for someone who finds intricate plots confusing, or long sequences without ""action"" boring. These are like the Harlequin Romance novels of Krondor.In Tear of the Gods, poor Jimmy can't walk to work in the morning without having to kill a couple of cutpurses, then has to off a few more when going out for lunch, and rounding the day off with another fight to the death before turning in at night. It rapidly approached ludicrousness. We also get to meet the most impotent wizard ever, who is skilled enough to be hand picked to be the court magical advisor, yet can't seem to get a single spell to finish a street tough. She ends most fights by whacking them over the head with her staff, seems kind of sad really.Old fans of the Krondor books will enjoy seeing more background on some favorite characters, new readers will be very disappointed."
2,Disappointment,"Our local library had this book three weeks ago so I jumped and was disappointed. Having followed the various series of Feist over the years, I am becoming disillusioned with the quality of writing, plots and characterisation in his Krondor books. Tear of the Gods reads like a second-rate boys' adventure story - laboured, predictable and internally inconsistent particularly with regards to the use or non-use of magic to solve problems in deference to the brute force approach. Subtlety is not part of this book and I closed it with no sense of engagement with the story and felt it added nothing to hte History of Krondor."
2,By far the worst in the series,You have to read it because it is part of the series but it comes across as a throw off. This has nothing of the detail that the other books have. Everything gets solved too easily and without detail. It really comes across a franchise book that needed to be in at by a deadline. More books like this and I won't be reading any further.
2,Overall a Disappointment,"While this was entertaining in parts I must agree with most of the other reviewers of this book that it was overall a disappointmentwhen one looks at The Riftwar Trilogy and the Empire Trilogy (cowritten with Janny Wurts) one sees a definite drop in standards'The Krondor series lacks the depth which one enjoys in other Feist novels as well as the character development and interplay between the charactersIts just one melee after the other.It was so easy to see that it is just an addition transcript of a D&D or Computer Fantasy Game sessionJazharra adds some interest to the book but like the others her character is not explored in any of the depth which we usually see in Feist's novelsFurthermore various potentially interesting characters such as the girl-thief Nita disappear before we get to know themMidkemia and Kelewan are fantastic world created by Feist , and have all the depth and scope of Tolkiens Middle EarthWhat a pity that this series does Fiest 's world a disservice"
3,A stilted plot ruins a potentially good book...,"As other reviewers have noted, the book follow the computer game ""Krondor: The Betrayal"" fairly closely. The structure that is acceptable in a computer game is not acceptable in a book. The book follows a very predictable, repeated, buildup, climax, denoument that you normally see in an episodic video game. I have read and enjoyed most of Raymond Feist's work, but this one was subpar and overall, not extremely interesting. I only hope his next works are better, as he is truly one of my favorite authors."
3,Saves Ammo,"I use this to sight in handguns when I install new sights. I have found it to be very good, and any error from sight to bullet placement is usually the shooters grip, trigger pull, or breathing issues. The plastic pieces that adapt to various calipers are easy to change. I have put a small strip of duct tape around the body where it makes contact with the barrel of the gun. This seems to seat the device a little better and minimizes any movement."
2,Laser Bore Sighter,"It is advertised as working for all rifles and pistols. Not correct. If your barrell is less than 4 inches long, as is my Ruger .380 and my Taurus .38 special +P, it won't work properly.I also have two handguns with longer barrels and it works great with them."
4,This book doesn't need a review!,"I have always been a fan of Dominique Lappiere & Larry Collins writing, O Jerusalem is a page turner that gives you goose-bumps. A book about a place that never stops to amaze you. A must read."
3,Not bad,"This was an okay book - I finished it, which in itself says it is bearable. I just didn't get all excited or wrapped up in it. I think the main problem is that in mystery series you need to get invested in the main characters...and this book really never spends that much time with the two investigators. I was much invested in Rebecca and Josh's relationship than anything to do with the Knights. I just think the book needs to concentrate more on the central characters and hence more on a forward plot."
5,Good ab workout!,"I agree with the other reviewer that some prior yoga experience will help you move through this workout smoothly the first time, but I think even a beginner could probably pick it up after watching it a few times. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was surprised to find myself struggling in a few of the moves (I've been practicing yoga via DVDs for a while now, and have also started Windsor Pilates). I definitely felt the soreness in my abs the next day! I'd recommend this DVD."
4,How we live now,"Jeff Fischer's stories draw you in to intimate scenes of family, friends and love -- a young man, Mike Gallo, with his parents, brothers, and women. You are instantly and deeply present at the Gallo table, Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, or the corner of a street in Ljubljana, where, true to life, things are not quite as they seem nor perhaps going to work out quite right. These are self-contained short stories, but collectively they paint a picture of Mike's world that leads inexorably to the crisis of the last story. Compelling, clear, and vast in the geographies both of the world and the human heart, Jeff Fischer's ""In Our Time"" captures a young man's time fully and memorably."
5,Sparknotes Rule!!,"We are collecting as many Sparknotes as possible. When you are required to read Shakespeare, you must have a guide. It's that simple. There is no guide better, in our opinion as teachers, and students of literature."
3,Arrived quickly. Takes some skill to learn to use,"The product arrive quickly and appears to be well made. I have not had an opportunity to use the Gripper extensively yet since I am just beginning my project. As I was experimenting with it, I quickly learned that it takes some practice to learn how to use it correctly. When in the right position, the device holds securely. However, I found that if I bumped the panel I was carrying is such a way that the weight of the panel was momentarily shifted off the gripper, that it lost is friction fit and the panel slipped off, not a good thing with drywall. So, it is very important to make sure the gripper is alway carrying the weight of the panel."
5,A must have for horse owners!,"The maker of this product missed the boat when they didn't include how handy it could be for people with horses who use rubber stall mats! Our horses always to manage to get their 4'x6'x1"" rubber mats out of place. Those 100 pound mats are big, heavy and extrememly difficult to move around, even with 2 people. With this tool, just about anybody can move the mats all by themselves. I ordered 2 more so I could keep 2 in the barn and 1 in the garage."
5,Great product,"I saw this item on the DIY show ""Cool Tools"" and I knew it would be useful to me to move sheets of plywood and sheetrock around by myself. I am not a contractor, but occasionally do my own work around the house. I used the product right out of the box and used it to move a 4X8 sheet of 3/4 inch plywood with ease. It easy to use, has a comfortable grip and holds without slip."
3,Not as useful as I had anticipated,"This one wasnt quite as I thought it would be.I think it would be better for a taller individual as im a bit under 6 feet, i find it would be much more maneuverable if a typical 4' wide board were a bit higher off the floor.And becuase the physics of the device required its own weight to maintain grip, you cant well angle the board once lifted to another position, like to go up steps or such, without worrying if your going to lose the load.I often just dont use it."
3,book is small and confusing to use,This book is too small to hold and open for reading. It would have been better if it was a big book so it's easier to use. Also I thought it was poorly organized. It wasn't as I expect it to be. Look for other books instead.
1,poor book,"in only one chapter, I found what I thought were two errors: the author mixed up churning and twisting, and had the wrong definition for 'per stirpes'. Very discouraging."
4,Get a feel of the industry!,I have several different resources I'm using to study for my life insurance test and what I was looking for was a book that could give me a feel for the insurance business as a producer and one who really likes helping people. This book does that and more and makes you understand what a great field this is and how you can make peoples lives better by providing this service. You have to go for it and this book can help you for sure. Great book!
4,SERIOUS MOONLIGHT SUCCESS,"1983 was a great year for Bowie. He had 2 films, made the cover of Time magazine, and a massive world tour. Mega success at last for an artist who had been a critic's favourite and had garnered a faithful (but not mass) following. ""Let's Dance"" was slick as it comes and remains Bowie's best mainstream work. With Stevie Ray Vaughn on guitar and Niles Rodgers in production - it was a killer combination. Though commercial in beat, the diversity of material on the disc remains Bowie's hallmark. Although subsequent albums show him trying to live up to the commercial success of this album (and failing by his own estimation) - this album was one of the best of the 80s, and capped the end of a tremendous musical ride by Bowie which began in the late 60s.If you're new to Bowie, this would be a good introduction. Or one of the greatest hits compilations. 4 1/2 stars."
5,Everything about this album is a classic,"1983 was an amazing year for music, with huge releases from Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Big Country, and many of my other favorite 80's bands. Bowie's album 'Let's Dance' had three major hits with 'Modern Love', 'China Girl' and 'Let's Dance', plus the edgy 'Cat People' from the movie of the same name.I was not a big Bowie fan before this album, but I quickly went back and started picking up his past work after this album. I believe this album to be one of best, along with 'Scary Monsters' and the more recent 'Earthling'."
3,Worthwhile.,"Bowie's entrance into the mainstream comes with a bang. The first three tracks on Let's dance are classics. They incorporate everything that's good about eighties' music. The rest of the album unfortunately is a bit mediocre. Things just don't get as inspired as on the first three songs. It's a shame, but Let's dance is still a worthwhile album."
4,Good book,"The new version of Oracle does not include MySQL*Plus, which is a very useful tool while learning SQL, however learning with only the console, while sporting a larger learning curve, will prepare you for working with the Oracle console.If you are definitely going to be using SQL with only Oracle, this is a good book. If you are going to be using SQL with other DBMS (like MySQL), a book about just SQL would be a better choice. The O'Reilly series is fantastic."
4,Pilates Body Conditioning,"This is a good book for Pilates beginners who don't have enough time to go through the thoroughness and nitty gritty that other Pilates book (such as Body Control Pilates) offers, because the information are presented succinctly yet completely. The self-assessment portion helps figure out how to align your spine and posture, and the warm up exercises really serve to limber up your body in preparation for the workout. In fact, if performed accurately and correctly, the warm up exercises can constitute a workout in themselves. The book comes with full-color photographs. For each particular step, photos are shown. Arrows help the reader figure out which direction to move their limbs. Alternative exercises for those with injuries are also included. For those who wish to do Pilates in a Pilates gym/studio, a chapter is also devoted on a typical exercises that one can do using Pilates equipment."
1,WORTHLESS!!!,"This book only presents a sequence of screen shots, from MS Windows. The book doesn't explain, not even briefly, how IP hosts utilize subnet masking, nor how data goes from layer to layer on the IP stack.Don't waste your money!"
2,This book should have had a Harlequin warning on its cover,"I have really enjoyed other Richard Paul Evans books--such as the Carousel, the Looking Glass, and, of course, The Christmas Box. But, after reading this book, I wondered if Mr. Evans has been attending mindless romance novel workshops."
3,I give it a C+,"I almost didn't read this book because I didn't want to have a guided tour of an Italian art gallery complete with English subtitles. After a day of letting it sit, I decided to give it a chance. Something intrigued me about the premise that it was based on a ""true story."" However, I just couldn't buy the main character ""Eliana"" who is American with many American tendancies, but she allows herself to be bullied by her Italian husband to the point of being beaten and then promises him she'd do ""anything"" if he won't take her son away from her. She'd even break the heart of her newfound love -- twice!! It's just too unbelievable. As mentioned in other reviews, the descriptions of Italy are great, but the story line leaves you disappointed."
5,My favorite thus far!!,"This is my favorite Richard Paul Evans book thus far! Richard has such a way of bringing his charactors to life. He captured the beauty and essence of Italy, and made me fall in love again. I will be reading this novel again and passing this book on to my friends."
2,SOAP OPERAS ... EAT YOUR HEART OUT,"Not to be too cynical here but, puhleese! This book is melodramatic, predictable, and sappy. Richard Paul Evans' use of intricate detailing paints a pretty picture but, essentially, adds nothing to the story in terms of character development and plot progression. More than halfway through the book the reader still knows next to nothing about Ross Story OR Eliana except that extenuating emotional circumstances, and the added convenience of locality, brought them together. And, of course they find each other attractive and stimulating - heaven forbid the guy that moves in next door be a troll. If you want a realistic love story ... go read some Richard Yates, or even John Irving. These are two writers who really know how to get at the core of human emotion. Richard Paul Evans, for me, misses the mark."
1,As bad as it gets,This is a 'sound-alike' group plastering together snippets of Gibb songs that should never have been released. It is an embarrasment.
2,Animal House South,"Dense with the cries of animals, birds, and insects, this makes me feel more like I am trapped on the Ark on about the fifteenth day than that I am in a jungle. If you like this sort of noise, good for you. Would you like to buy my hardly played copy? I would rather the livestock had been spaced with the air sounds of a jungle for a more realistic feel."
1,A Waste of My Time,"I read this book because I liked his show on E!Mysteries& Scandals. I have never a read a book with so muchego in it. I really did not care how many women he sleptwith or the stars he hung out with. Please, his littlestory about John Kennedy Jr. was such a joke. John hasmore class than to hang with Benza. I got tired of his""more on this later"" you would forget what later was.And every other word was f***ing this or that. He is awanna be mafia guy, only problem is he would be not makeit in that world. His 15 min. of fame are over. No wonderhe got kicked off Howard Stern, he is a jerk. All the picsin the book are of him looking ""tough"". Sorry, AJ but youare all talk. Get a real job. I read the book to the endonly because I was laughing so hard. Now the pages linemy cats litter box. Lets hope for our sake he never writesa book again. Hey, AJ, can I can get my money back!"
1,Wholesale garbage,"I spent an hour trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, even called arrow customer service to find the power adjustment that I just could not see. The agent was kind enough to tell me that they had never gotten a complaint about the ET200. Yeah right. DON'T waste your time with this Piece Of Shnot. I would be surprised if it could drive the smallest of nails into balsa wood."
1,Worthless,"This was an impulse purchase, as I am installing a simple baseboard. It will be an impulse return. If you bought this, take it back. If you are thinking of buying it, don't bother.This product worked for all of 5 minutes before it stopped. The nails stuck out 1/4"". Read the other colorful reviews. This is not worth your time or money!"
1,WEAK PRODUCT,"This tool is completely useless even for those who would use the smallest of brads for the weakest of jobs. I believe the one gentleman who gave it a good review and said it was ""VERY POWERFUL"" must be a spokesman for the company because I assure you it's a ""VERY WEAK PRODUCT""."
1,Do Not Buy!,How could Arrow actually release this product and make money on it? I just fired 4 brads and the gun went up in smoke! Literally! I opened up the gun and the inside was charred. I'm clearly returning it.
1,Listen to the wisdom of the group,"You'd have more success pushing nails in with your thumb than you will with this product. Concur with the other negative reviews listed. Am writing this to inform the general populace that as of June 2008 - the unit is STILL as bad as the earlier reviews indicate. Ours lasted for 15-20 1 in nails installing pine trim. I've spent the better part of the day trying new outlets, new nails, and cleaning the unit to no avail.It's too late for me. Learn from my mistake and save yourself!"
2,Of limited use to the beginner,"I bought this book because I hoped it would teach me to knit. I found that I couldn't follow the directions for simple things like casting on, casting off, switching colour or starting a new ball, and ended up watching video demonstrations on YouTube to get the hang of all these things. Another reviewer has noted the shortcoming in the instructions -- so to speak -- for picking up a dropped stitch. Similarly, telling someone to tie the yarn ends together when swtiching colours is useless if you don't also tell them how to go about switching the yarn in the first place, nor is it clear from this book exactly how one switches needles in the middle of the project. What I do like is the stitch library, and for me the book is worth owning for that. For apparently more complex things, like cable knits, I'm going to have someone teach me in person."
3,The finish in the pot is peeling 9 months after purchase,Pot cooks well. 9 months after purchase the finish in the pot is peeling. The most the pot is used is once a week on average. i would have expected it to hold out alot longer for this brand!!
1,Doesn't cook the food !,"I also was disappointed with this crock pot. I have always loved the West Bend heated base with separate pan that I would brown the meat in first. I have a cheaper W/B one that cooks rings around this one, even on medium. I wanted a better pot and spent more than I wanted to, but thought it would be worth it, but it was not. I gave it more than one chance, on different temps but got the same results. By this time, I lost my receipt and had to keep it. West Bend gave me no answer with an email. :("
2,BEWARE OF COATING,"This is the 3rd slow cooker with heated base that I have had in 30+ years. By far this is the worst one as far as durability that I have owned. In the past the interior bottom of the cooker has worn and the coating has become scratched and has worn away in spots after YEARS of ownership and use. However, I have had this one far less than a year and have used it only for spaghetti sauce and heating already made beef stew, chicken/biscuits, etc. I have never used any utensils that would scratch the interior and yet there is an obvious line about 1.5 inches from the top on one side along the length of the cooker where the surface has obviously worn off. WHY would it have worn??? I have only used wooden spoons and do not stir along the cooker's interior. I have been very conscious of this one since it was very expensive compared to past prices and I intended to keep it a long time. I would not recommend this cooker in spite of the many nice features. No telling what is in the coating."
1,This Book Put Me To Sleep,"I've never read Karen Harper before and when I saw the summary ofthis one I thought it looked good. I was wrong. There is waytoo much dialogue in some scenes of this book and the charactersdon't show a lot of emotion. This book has a few parts that weremysterious, the rest seemed dull and drawn out. I was happy that the author didn't include profanity or any brutal violence, but instead of a classic thriller she ended up writing a predictable story. I hope her other books are better."
1,Wasted money,"Though ""romantic suspense"" novels are not my usual favorite, I picked up The Stone Forest in the airport last week looking and hoping for a light read and passing entertainment. Within 6 pages I knew I had wasted my money. The dialogue in this book is - - horrible. I literally could have done it better myself. The basic plot had potential, the writing skills and dialogue between characters are just very very bad. It's already in the bag of things to give away."
1,Cheap and Not sized correctly,"I should have took the other reviews to heart. This costume is cheap, cheap, cheap and WAY smaller than the stated size. Although not expensive, it was a waste of money!"
2,JB CD - Introducting Jonathan Butler,I bought this years ago on cassette and really wanted the CD version. They shipped me the wrong CD in the right case and really didn't do anything to correct their error. I am very disappointed.
2,Not worth the money,"There's nothing wrong with this book, per se, but it gives very bacic information that could easily be found on the internet. It does not get very in depth about any of the things I wanted to know. I feel it should have really elaborated on how to grow Wheatgrass and should have offered a variety of arrangements and all possible methods."
2,Couldn't get into it - way too country for me.,I tried but couldn't get into this music album. Way too country for me and nothing memorable. If you like country you might find it OK but it just wasn't for me.
1,I think a revolution is in order...,"I must say, they have made one of the funniest music videos ever for the very originally titled ""If You Ever Stop Loving Me"". Such a weak, wimpy song - such predictable, maudlin lyrics...paired with these guys in leather and riding Harleys trying desperately to look tough - it's quite funny and sad - especially the obnoxious looking guy who doesn't do anything but twirl his little mic stand around like it's a cool thing to do...but the redneck housewives' hearts still flutter all across the land for this crap. How do these guys sleep at night? probably on a pile of your money - so do not contribute to their attack on the integrity of country music or our nations culture - we can rise above mediocrity! join hands, put down your spinning mic stands, proudly walk into record shops and purchase good music instead of this! Yeah!"
5,You Do Your Thing,"Everyone needs to live life by that philosophy 'You Do Your Thing'. It says to me that it is ok to be different and these guys prove it. Every song on this CD is great! Even my kids tell me which song they want to hear by the number placement they are on the CD, Mom can we hear number 3 then number 6....If you want to listen to something to lift your spirits when things aren't going your way, get this CD. It can make the worst day turn out to be the best!"
1,LIFE AND DEATH ON THE MISSISSIPPI,"There is so much wrong with this disaster I don't know where to start. SOUND MIXING- horrible. You can barely hear the dialogue (which may be an unintended blessing). But if you want to hear the sound of clanking dinnerware, the click of a recording button, or mosquitoes at deafening levels, this is yourt picture!The director also uses lengthy fades to no avail and shot the film in black and white, green and white, sepia and white, and color??? The lighting is so bad you can't see what's going on, and the plot (?) is so incoherent, the movie makes no sense. And the whole thing is BOOOORING!Avoid this at all costs!!!"
5,"Sad, sad, sad... mesmerizing","When I first saw this movie I thought it was one of the saddest and most beautiful films I'd ever seen, which I still think today. The fugitive, the melancholic painter, the abused girl, the ship, and the dog, oh yes, the dog will break your heart and duly so. This was the kind of movie Marcel CarnÃ© used to make, sad and beautiful, effortless, peerless, unforgettable. He later made Children of Paradise, which is far more ambitious than Port of Shadows in narrative and production terms and although Children of Paradise is usually considered his greatest film, I'd be hard pressed to tell which of the two is more ravishing. Children is a luxurious opera; Port is a mesmerizing chamber piece."
3,Life Stride Pump,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
2,Not sized correctly,These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size. I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks. The shoe literally slipped of my foot.
5,"samantha,leave me with the music","touch me by samantha fox is a very good first album. some of my favorite songs are touch me i want your body,wild kind of love, do ya do ya wanna please me,i'm all you need,and he's got sex. i really like this album."
4,Where are you even goin' with the recorder?,This comedy DVD is so funny and fresh. I caught it on TV with some friends and I had to buy it.
2,OK but Rigid Sander is Well worth the $$$'s,"I bought both Rigid and bosch at same time and could not compare apples to oranges. Rigid is Way better and made in Germany compared to Bosch ( not sure but it seems it is made in China ).Rigid is a high end sander at low price and I felt I paid too much for bosch..Try Rigid 6"" and you will be lot happy for flattening joint boards, panels and lot more.."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","I bought this game for my son who is almost two. He enjoyed it to a point, some of the games are a little hard for him, but he can play most of them. My biggest disappointment is that I will be taking it back this evening because the packaging says it will run on Windows XP, well this is partly true. It will run, but not correctly. I have run into this problem before with trying to find an educational game for my son that will actually run correctly. Overall, though, if it would actually work on my computer, these games would be pretty good."
3,Please pass the medicinal brandy. . .,"I was relieved to find I wasn't the only one disappointed in this latest installment. ""Falcon"" is still a worthy read, but not up to par. The relationships weren't developed enough, and the mystery was too predictable. Peabody and Emerson used to have such a delightful repartee! What happened?"
5,Riveted!,"I maintained a high level of interest reading all of the Peabody series, but 'Falcon at the Portal' kept me totally riveted to my reading seat after The Ramses-Nefret MOMENT. The rest of the pages flew by in my restless hands. I cannot wait for the next installment."
2,Bad turn for E. Peters,"I eagerly picked up the book with the expectation of a good reading, and was sorely disappointed. I have read all the previous volumes, enjoying the light tone, the banter and the eccentricity of Amelia and Co. This last effort is stilted and artificial, with too much melodrama; it reads like a cheap soap opera. It seems like Ms. Peters has tried to increase the emotional content of her work, with the result of making the story unbelievable and unpalatable.E. Peters stories are enjoyable because they don't have the high pressure of a story ""a la Stephen King"", and certainly a more pleasant athmoshpere. I agree with some of the other reviewers in considering this book a terrible faux-pas. Conan-Doyle had Holmes disappear in the waterfall...maybe Amelia should have been crushed within a pyramid?I am very sorry that I did not wait for the book to be in the library, but instead bought the hard-cover. For the next one, I'll wait until it will be on the shelves of our local branch."
2,Not again,"The suit lost color in about four or five months, The fabric is good, the suit has kept its for. But it just turned from black to brown, a sort of copper look. I am shopping for a Lycra one."
3,ok suit,"lost snugness and color within 2 weeks; while most suits I buy are a little generous, this Speedo came tight. thought the brand name and extra money would result in better overall, but just ok. think I'll go back to TYR."
3,Quality has gone down,"I bought this as a replacement for another Speedo model which looks exactly the same and sold for approximately the same price. This suit is simply two layers of nylon. Much lighter weight fabric. No modesty panel. (I am an older gent). Tie is now cord, not tape and is about two feet too long. In general, feel the quality of this suit is less than the model it replaces. When this one wears out, I'll probably look elsewhere for a replacement."
1,too tight and ugly,"I got this a few months ago and was trying to live with it. I have to buy another one I got so sick of this ugly shape and hard nylon material. The opening on the legs cuts in to your legs almost stopping blood flow! There is no way to adjust this, it's not elastic either but something hard and set and feels extremely uncomfortable. Generally, it's badly cut, badly designed, ugly and shapeless on the body, it sits on your like some kind of plastic bag you pulled over your privates. Avoid this like a plague."
5,"80's supergroup"" A Flock Of Seagulls""","This is the outstanding debut album by A Flock Of Seagulls.Each and every tune is great with catchy lyrics and riffs.My personal favorite is Standing in the Doorway.These blokes had bloody strange hairdoos to boot. All and all a great addition to any rock fans collection,Bravo!"
3,Heart just didn't seem to be in it...,"I was looking forward to reading this book and found myself disappointed. I kept thinking, ""That doesn't sound like something that character would say"". I couldn't help but feel that Ms. Maddison's heart was not really in this book. It seemed disconnected and forced in ways her other books did not. I noticed quite a few editing errors as well. Wish I could give this a better review. Enjoyed her other books and plan to give the next one a good chance."
3,"cute, but..","My son didn't care for these much. He wanted to hold everything and they were difficult to clutch. They're cute though, and at least *I* find them interesting! lol."
5,"Stylish, Compact, Cool !","My wife loves this small red leather case for her Canon SD600 camera. It has survived several airplane and road trips so far, with absolutely no damage to the case or the camera. In my opinion, a high quality item. Great price at Amazon (better than EBAY and other retailers), plus free shipping makes it a bargain."
5,"Fantastic, stylish camera case!","I am thrilled to have this beautiful red leather camera case. It fits my SD600 perfectly. Just like the camera, the case is stylish, elegant and functional.The leather is a rich red, and it is very well made. (Matches my Coach red leather wallet wonderfully!) The case features a tiny pocket that could hold an extra battery, a belt loop on the back, and a matching red leather wrist strap. The case closes with a magnetic snap and it features a metal Canon logo on the closure flap.A great case for a wonderful camera. I couldn't be more pleased!"
1,Do not buy such a product,"Small interior for the devices it is meant to protect. You insert SD600 CANON inside, the mode switch always comes out at a mode different. The slide key is changed by friction. The interior is also hard , not soft for such devices."
4,Built tough but too tough,I'm using this case for my Canon PowerShot SD500 digital elph although it's not designed for it. Initially it's hard to fit in because of the convex side of SD500 but as you can guess the case is made of leather!Pro: Tough and nice design.Con: Too tough and too thick to fit into my pocket with SD500 in it. Compromise the merit of point and shoot capability of ultracompact digital cameras.Overall not bad.
4,Great camera protector,I have been very pleased with this camera holder and the amount of protection it offers for my camera.
4,Perfect for the SD400,This cannon is a perfect fit for my SD400 and is made of good quality leather. Only minor complaint is that the magnet holding the flap closed could be a little stronger.
5,Great Purchase,"Definitley a good buy for the camera. Fit my 600 perfectly, nice and classy looking, not bulky so you can fit it in a small purse. Highly recommend it, great value."
4,Great but ...,"Great product. Fits well, sturdy and great price for the quality. The only downside is and please note this ... it does NOT fit the SD500. I ended up giving this to my dad for his Canon SD200 and buying the Coach case for my SD500 instead, which by the way I give 5 stars!"
4,Good Kit,"Just got done putting this kit in my friends car and it wirked as its suppose to, we had to take the metal braket out from behind the old stereo which was rather difficult, but we got it done. The wiring kit that comes with the kit runs from the stereo to the stock amplifier which is on the drivers side fender in the trunk."
5,A Must-Have for replacing your Taurus/Sable stock stereo,"This is a high quality kit for installing a new stereo on some models of the Ford Taurus and Mercuty Sable. The kit includes everything needed to interface with a new stereo (harness, cables, faceplate, etc.). The face plate is made of thick plastic and very sturdy. I'm very happy with the way it looked after installing it on my 2001 Taurus. I've been using it for quite a while and it has held up well. I highly recommend this kit - well worth the price!"
3,2000 Ford Taurus SE OEM to single DIN radio adapter,"Item as described and of high quality compared to other dash kits. Fast shipping and fast return.The seller gets 5 stars but the product only 3.The only reason I returned the Metra Dash Kit for a refund was because it is not quite the OEM look or quality of my 2000 Ford Taurus SE factory radio. I opted for a different modification to stock radio using an auxiliary adapter input, ""FRDR-AUX"", because it would have been more expensive replacing the radio, and the dash kit does not quite match the dash plastics."
4,Decent Product,"I ordered this for a 2002 For Taurus. The pattern on the front of the face plate does not perfectly match the trim in my car, but its close enough for me not to really care. The installation was not overly difficult. The included wiring harnesses matched up exactly with my vehicle, which is the main reason for my review. This item will match up with the vehicles listed. To hook up an after market radio you will need the wiring diagram for the new radio. If you order a radio new the diagram will be in the box. If I had to, I would order this product again."
5,An exploration of people,Not my usual read. But I was drawn in by the unique perspective of each character. Watching their roads unfold in the exquisite detail and rich portrayal by the author made this a book that drew me in and didn't let me put it down.
3,Keep the remote handy,"My minor complaint is the inclusion of the faux computer screen titles. I can only guess that these are intended to appeal to young children who like video games. My major complaint is the ad-libbed interviews with actors representing warriors. For me, they are unbearable, and I can only stand to watch this if I make heavy use of the mute button. These actors have about as much insight into what the battles were really like as CSPAN callers have about how to run the country.Strip away these two items and the show, while nowhere near as stunning as Simon Schama's _History of Britain_, would be worth watching."
4,Nice attempt at recreating war,"How does one convey the experience of war? Other than putting one in battle, it's difficult. This series does quite well in its short segments. And that is my biggest complaint - that each battle coverage is too short. Yet given their time constraints, they do an excellent job. The weakest point is that some of their modern explorations of the past equipment and experiences are a bit superficial - the tacking against the wind, for instance. But these are only a small proportion of the total time spent. My biggest wish is that each segment had been twice as long. It's very good stuff!"
3,Path of the jaguar,This was a pretty fast paced book. You can picture being there. It still needed more info on the archeological aspects but it was pretty good.
3,More Bubbles than Beverly,"A light,fun and safe view of a majestic woman and career.Watch her performances instead."
2,Way too big!,"Based on some other reviews that claimed space was somewhat limited in the bag, I expected it to be relatively compact--which is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, when it arrived I discovered this bag is huge--even though it says it fits up to a 15.4"" laptop, I was able to fit my roommate's 17.5"" laptop inside the padded pouch easily with room to spare. I thought it might be a mistake, but the tag attached to it says the same thing, ""fits up to 15.4 inches."" Materials do seem to be very high quality though, unfortunately I wasn't looking for a small suitcase."
3,"Expected it to fit my 17"" Gateway","I guess a 17""Macbook is different in size from a 17"" laptop of another brand. My laptop won't fit in the padded compartment, but fits in the other compartment where you'd put books and such....Nice bag though, just disappointed I can't use it as I intended...."
3,it was a bit short,it wasnt the anarchist cookbook that i was looking for but seeing as which i dont remember exactly which 1 i had before what can i do but keep looking
3,The Real Problem,"This book is entertaining, and if anyone blames it for prblems in the world, you must understand that this book is not the problem. People who a sick enough will take this information in this book and use it against people. To anyone he is thinking about reading this book think,""could I be one of those people who would use the recipes in this book for farmful destruction?"" If you have any doubts in your mind, I highly suggest you click the back button, and don't return!"
5,Even the good guys need to read once in a while,This book which was written 33 years ago is many things to many people.As I AM A SOLDIER WITH 3(THREE) MILITARY JOB SPECIFICATIONS [Signal] MOS31-U {nuclear Biological & Chemical}MOS 54B and (Infantry)MOS 11B this book is required reading for urban asslat and defense of our great Nation.A little common sense goes a long way for everyone. Be careful be wise as Serpants. Knowledge is what this book is giving. Not Common sense.A comprehensive explanation of things you can do to relieve a little stress in you life and add some too.IF YOU ARE NOT A CHEMIST DO NOT TRY ANY OF THE RECIPIES THEY ARE DANGEROUS AND WILL KILL YOU.The Book is an icon of the 60's culteral revolution.The Book is a Good/Bad book not to be taken lightly.This book is Brutal and Loving. (self preservation is vital)This book is just as important as the Art of War and no less dangerous.A book of simple facts for the anti-anarchist as well.
2,Freedom not to Speak,"Undoubtedly Mr. Powell's book had an important place in history.It should not be banned for discussing the topics it does.Though it may be dangerous, due to its errors, not to any""establishment"" but to readers themselves. However, Freedomof Speech includes the freedom not to speak. Based on Mr.Powell's brief history above, he probably has much greaterlegal recourse than he realizes. (He expects the publisherto explain his rights against them???? Some anarchist!)But action is required to preserve those rights.Mr. Powell should contact a copyright lawyer ASAP."
2,The Anarcist Cookbook,I reveiw this book very poorly do to its great inacuracys. This book is all most made to kill your self this is a great book to laugh at as long as you do not try any of these things at home due to the grave inacuracys. I rate this book as a cool thing to put on your coffee table.
2,Disappointing,"As with any ""banned"" book I purchased this just to support the 1st Amendment. Sounds crazy I know but this is just something I do. I was extremely disappointed with the contents. It seemed as if 90% of the book was a ""how to"" manual on bombs and/or expolsives. There was a very brief segment on legal ""drugs"" or narcotics and how, where, quantity, etc. Other than that, there was very, very little substance to this popular book. I don't know what I was expecting but something a little more subversive and anti-establishment, whatever that may be. I imagine that since the advent of the world wide web, the contents of the book can be found much easier online and this book will soon, if not already, be outdated and blaise. Couldn't help but wonder the type of person who would purchase this material. Perhaps Timothy McVeigh."
3,Outdated. Mildly entertaining.,"Now that we have the Internet, this book isn't nearly as shocking as it once was. This book covers everything from setting booby traps, to identifying weapons, to making explosives from ingredients around the home. Even though it seems fairly tame now, it's still not a book that people should treat lightly. For most, I'm sure people read it for 'shock value' but it's scary to think what you can do with just a few household items."
3,This book is outdated....,"Putting any of the information given out in this book to use would be suicide, as all of the techniques listed inside are outdated to say the very least...not to knock it's great historical value though, as it will always be a staple for any true anarchist! If anything this book is a novelty item."
3,Not the best...,"Not exactly the best explosives book, theres lots better.But then again its quite old.If you really want to learn how to make bombs download the anarchist cookbook 97 or some of the jolly rogers files.Military improvised munition books are usefuel too.so if your looking for material on how to make bombs, skip this one.And dont confuse with real anarchism.By the way im 13 :)"
2,Scary if you actually follow any of the content,"My dad bought this book sort of as a joke about 15/20 years ago. Since my father has always been on the fringe, seeing something like this didn't surprise me. I read it while home on a visit and bored. I was pretty shocked at what was in the book. How to make drugs, how to take drugs, how to make bombs, etc. I have no idea if the information was accurate, but simply attempting anything in this book would probably not have a good result. He just asked me if I remembered it the other day and I wanted to see if it was still published. The thing that sticks in my mind the most is the peyote section. Yuck."
4,Had to See What the Fuss was About!,"I also found that a lot of the content of this book was basicknowledge as taught in Military Handbooks!Don't blame the book or author for someone using basicstuff that's been taught to GOD only knows how many peoplethat our government trusted the knowledge with.I use to dislike Big Brother.But, I found we all need him to watch over our freedom. I was bitter because my brother died in Vietnam,but I got over it! Time heals all wounds!All that saidit's a good book! No one wins in war!"
2,"A basic Anarchy know-how book. Broad contents, but outdated","This book is not meant for the average reader. It's just a basic guide for an Anarchist, teaching him recipes for explosives, drugs and firearms. However, what makes this book disapointing is that it is very outdated (almost worthless, Think! more than 2 decades ago!!!) as most of it's contents are widely available on the web. Also as newer and improved recipes are comming out ocassionally, many would ever wonder if they want to pay that much for a stack of papers. Think twice before buying this book.(that is unless if you are trying to collect the books featured on Rage Against the Machine's ""Evil Empire"" album, or just trying to own an antique).I leave the decision to u..."
4,"Sehr interessant, wenn in den richtigen Haenden","Dieses Buch ist eine sehr interessante Anregung zum ThemaBombe-Basteln, geht aber ueber das Pepe-der-Pauker-Schreck-Niveaudeutlich hinaus. Es ist, auch wenn es so scheint, nicht als Anregung oder gar Aufruf zu verstehen, die beschriebenen Pl\344ne umzusetzen. Versteht es einfach als eine Art Satire oder la\337t die Finger davon. Schlie\337lich k\366nnt Ihr damit nicht nur andere verletzen, sondern auch Euch selbst. Fuer denjenigen, der den noetigen (pechschwarzen) Humor mitbringt, ist es eine echt Bereicherung und sollte dierekt neben den Satanischen Versen stehen."
3,A pretty decent book that should have been more.,This book showed some potential when I first read a bit of it at the local flea market. But when I took it home and reviewed it more in depth I found that a large portion of it was about growing drugs. I ain't no fiend so this book was pretty useless. And the bomb section was pretty vauge so it was kind of disappointing.
3,good read,"I think the this book is a good read. It increases kids knowledge on many illegal acts, however I think it should include information about anarchism and politics to fit the title. This book should be called the barbians cookbook, it only teaches destruction."
3,"Alright, but not so much detail","This book is alright for good bathroom reading, but it's not the most detailed thing in the world. Illustrations are difficult to understand but should work. The weapons page is out of date. This book is old-school, newer and better stuff is free on the internet."
2,"Lighten up, folks!","The author has provided the context in which he wrote this book. As an adolescent boy in the 1970s, I found it an interesting read. Since I had the good sense to not attempt any of the hare-brained schemes in the book, I am still healthy and have all of my limbs. If people are interested in improvised munitions and the like, there are at least six (6) US Army FMs and TMs on the subject that I am aware of. Bear in mind that the making of explosive devices is a serious felony, and should not be attempted without the proper Federal and State licenses and permits. BATFE does not take kindly to the making of unregistered and untaxed explosives."
4,Good Product,"So far so good, does not have a strong smell out of the bag but you need to sand the items and then they're much better smelling."
4,A Pretty Good Pillow!,I ordered these pillows because I needed to replace my old flat pillows. These pillows were very fluffy and firm. I've had the pillows a few months now and they have flattened somewhat but not enough that I have to go out and buy new ones again. I would purchase these pillows again.
2,"Feels cheap, had to return it.","This pillow was just too firm. Doesn't cradle to your head properly. Can't adjust it unless you force it. If attempting to adjust, it clumps up and easily deforms and is difficult to get it back to its original form. Cheap filling."
1,countless errors from a publisher that should LEARN TO EDIT,"Sams publishing should be ashamed (unfortunately they're too busy counting their money from people like me that were stupid enough to buy their books).If you are trying to learn to program in C++, avoid this title AND this publisher. If you must read their books for reference--check them out from the local library (and then make a donation with the money you save).READER WARNING: This book (and other sam's titles) will make you want to slam your head against the wall!"
3,Another good read.,"This novel is entertaining. I think P.D. James is always a good read. You can't really go wrong. Her characters are compelling, and the plot has enough mystery to keep you interested. I would recommend this book.Donna Gormly"
3,Just Fair,"It took longer than expected to arrive (a good 10 days after receiving another book from a different vendor which was purchased the same day). The book was listed as being in ""very good"" condition, but I was a little disappointed. It is well worn, though there are no interior markings. Another point worth mentioning is that is has different cover art than expected. I would have preferred the cover advertised."
4,Not for SD450,"I recently received this case as a gift for use with my SD400 and I expect it will be great. However, a co-worker was comparing it to her SD450 we quickly came to the conclusion that the case buttons would not line up with the camera controls on the SD450. A check on the Canon web site shows the AW-DC50 is the correct case for the SD450. I would be really upset if I read the title on this product and bought it for an SD450 only to find that it was not the correct item."
1,NOT for the Canon SD450!,"I just purchased this item for my upcoming trip to Maui. Amazon claims that it will work for the Canon SD450. To be honest, yes it can BUT it's not ideal. The buttons are located to line up with the Canon SD300, a vastly different camera than the SD450. You can put the SD450 in the case, turn it on, zoom with it, and take the pictures, but if you want to use ANY of the other features (like turning the flash on and off- which is important underwater) you can't use them because they aren't lined up properly for the SD450. Do NOT buy this case for that camera. Buy the AW-DC50 instead. Don't make my mistake because I'm going to Maui in less than a week and I have to pay out the nose to make sure the correct case gets here in time."
1,10 feet is ridiculous,"this much money for a shell that won't even take your camera to the deep end of a pool is crazy. Very frustrating, since all the other Canon shells go to more than 100 ft., which is more than enough for anyone with a basic open-water license."
3,Suggested for Collectors Only!,"I knew this was a ""bad"" recording from the television production before I purchased it, but as a musical theatre CD collector, I wanted what would be considered the closet thing to a ""full"" cast recording of this show. And since this is the only one out there, you don't have a choice. I'm not disappointed in having a ""complete"" recording of this show; however, I am disappointed the quality is so poor. If you're a musical theatre collector, I can suggest it; if you want it so you can listen to all the wonderful songs this show has,you'll be greatly diappointed in the poor sound."
5,Accessories Caution,"I just started playing with my new camera. I notice the batteries don't last very long, especially when doing many functions. I started to price the AC Adapter (HP $49.99) and found that most on eBay are generic multi voltage units (around $30). Then while looking at the HP Photosmart 8881 Camera Dock (HP $79.99) I noticed that it too included a AC Adapter. I called HP and found out that it is the identical adapter that will hook directly to the camera. So I was able to get the HP Adapter AND the Docking Station for just a little more than the generic adapter alone."
3,Great Book with big time price,This is a great book with a lot of great information. I had a class in which we utilized this book. The price is very high and what I did was get the second edition of the book. There is not really a difference in content other than a few updated graphs. I suggest clicking on the used button to link to used copies where you will find the second edition of the book. As opposed to spending 150 dollars for a new 3rd edition book I spend 6 dollars on a second edition copy. Great Buy
1,This movie is...,...comparable to the experience of staring at a stranger's bowel movement for an hour and a half.
3,Great Concept,"Technically this is not a great movie, but as I watched it I wanted it to be better because this story of reincarnation is a worthy one. I don't care for the photo on the dvd case. It seems to be packaged for the wrong audience. Overall, I commend the maker of this film and would like to see a re-make that a larger budget would permit. I also liked the closing song."
1,Worst gay film I have seen,"What a disaster. A good example of of a talentless writer/directer who has no flair for making movies. Jeorge Ameer is really a no talent wonder. His script is so light, if you were to drop it from the ceiling, it would take two weeks to reach the floor. And somebody should tell him ""directing"" a film calls for more ability than to simply let a camera aim and shoot. I don't find anything about this tripe worth praising. It is void of any artistic vision. And the low budget is no excuse for it being so bad! Case in point: ""The journey of Jarred price,"" was made for $20,000 and it was a very good gay themed movie.I could elaborate, but why bother? A movie this terrible deserves no attention. The only reason I am posting this review is to possibly save other people from having to watch this."
1,Garbage! Possibly the worst movie ever made!,"Jorge Ameer has created the most unwatchable film I have had the misfortune of watching. Ameer seems to have no knowledge of how to direct a movie. Waves crashing and dogs barking are just some of the background noise that drown out the actors. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing though, as the movie is alful. Dreadfully stupid writing, badly edited, bad bad bad. The longest 90 minutes I have ever spent trying to watch a movie.My advise: stay away from this trash at all costs! It is dreadful!"
5,"Wow, just wow!","This cd is it. I was never a fan of Dreamstreet, I actually hated them. But Jesse as a solo artist is perfect. This cd is the best! I love it. My favorite songs are Beautiful Soul, What's Your Name? and Because You Live. Absolutely amazing job Jesse!"
5,jesse the best singer ever,"my name is lauren [...]. I LOVE jesse mccartney. His music inspires me to work harder in school, and to be more confident in my beautiful soul. Jesse is not just a great singer, but he is so cute. I want to pinch his hard nipples and twist them around. I love his hair. It makes me wanna hump my bed. No seriously, you need to buy this album. It will change your life, and make music sound good, unlike some other male singers, like that hunk Justin Timblelake."
5,I know em,"i knew him, we were best friends, kinda like brothers, i moved in with his family too. he also has his own car. But anyway, this album is great. I don't care if he sings like a girl (because he doesn't), you all should say that about usher. And he told me that he wrote two of his songs (forgot which 2), i think one of them was beautiful soul. my favorite songs on this cd are get your shine on, beautiful soul, and because you live.. See ya"
5,"Fun, artistic, good cd. Â¡Â¡Â¡","Jesse has come to stay. This cd proves that Jesse McCartney is a real singer, the cd shows a great vocal aptitude like no other in his kind. The songs are all fun and with good lyrics, in one word ""great"". I just have to say: ""if you're a real music fan, you have to get this cd""."
5,Still the BEST album so far!!,"I LOVE this import!!I was completely surprised when I heard the extra 2 tracks, I was like ""OMG!! What is this, this is not on the regular (US) version!?"" I listened and fell in love with them--totally awesome!!I also like the cover, it has more sophistication than the original (again, US), its more intimate and alluring--almost a mystery too, because our beloved singer is looking to the side and not to the camera.I have the most recent of his albums and #1 still blows me away.Still the BEST ALBUM ever!!Elfarran."
2,"has a good voice, but bad taste in music","If you under the age of seventeen, you like Nick Carter and Cristina Aguilara, and :cringe: Lindsay Lohan, then by all means buy this album, you will enjoy it.However, if you are a looking for something that will be a priceless classic in years to come (aka you won't be embarrassed to own in 20 years) stick with Michael Jackson. And if you want romantic music with someone who has a great voice AND good music lyrics/music then buy an album by Andrea Bocelli or Josh Groban.Jesse McCartney has the voice, he just needs to grow out of childish Justin Timberlake/Usher phase. I give him 10 years. If he isn't burnt out and hanging with Pauly Shore in 10 years, I'd buy his album."
4,I'm A BOY the writer is a boy OK,She's No You - 10/10Beautiful Soul - 8/10Get Your shine On - 9/10Take Your Sweet Time - 10/10 - Best SongWithout U - 10/10Why Don't You Kiss Her - 4/10That WAs Then - 10/10Come to Me - 7/10What's Your Name - 7/10Because You Live - 9/10Why Is Love So Hard To Find - 7/10The Stupid Things - 10/10Good Life - 10/10
5,AMAZING!,"Oh wow! Dreamstreet totally blew me away with ""It Happens Everytime [Remix]"" and ""I Miss You."" Jesse has done such an amazing job on his solo album. He sure is one talented 17 year-old. Out of all my favorite singers, he surely tops them all off! He's got amazing rhythm and upbeat sounds. He's so amazing and talented. If anything I wish I could sing just like him. I can't wait until I can be to the point where he is! He's accomplished so much in his 17 years. Congrats to Jesse for an amazing solo debut album and wonderful songs! Keep up the good work!P.S. You write fabulous songs! I can't imagine you as a weak-writer...you really speak out to other people/ fans...especially me!"
2,disappointing,"I'm not into teeny bopper music but when I caught a 2 minute clip of him on tv I thought he had a decent voice and beatboxing though he looked like aaron carter. But he's so stupid, he doesn't realize that he's copying michael jackson(horrible at it too)) and thinks he's copying justin timberlake who copies MJ. And I lost all respect for him when he was bashing mj, who's accomplished more than he has in the music business, aaron, oops jesse should respect talents that came before him cause they have a much more ""beautiful soul"" than him and his stupid ego."
5,Energetic,"I saw Jesse McCartney on ""Dancing with the Stars"" when he sang ""Get your shine on"" and I loved the samba beat. It illustrated energy and made me want to dance. I assumed it would be the only song that I would really like, but I was wrong. I truly enjoy the entire cd. I highly recommend it."
4,A voice like an angel!,"I got this CD yesterday and I can't tell you how much I love it. I've listened to it three times already! The only songs I don't like are Get Your Shine On, because it's so annoyingly repetitious, and Why Don't You Kiss Her? because it's too slow. All the other songs are fantastic, though. I would recommend this CD to any girl."
4,BETTER EACH TIME I SEE IT,I have watched 'The Prince Of Egypt' video about 3 times. Each time the content and message gain depth. It is a captivating way to communicate 'highlights' of Moses' extradonary life as he follows his heart and the voice of God. I encourage you to read the Exodus account in an easy to understand translation. Then watch 'The Prince of Egypt' again and see the wonder.
1,PLAYING IN HISTORY,"this movie referes to a real story of the Prophet Moses, but it does'nt tell us the real story and its just like trying to change history"
1,Have small children - avoid this film,"It almost seems Dreamscape has some not-so-hidden agenda oftreating the very young to entirely inappropriate themes. First they had ANTS, a film full ofoutrageous violence, full blown war, and over the top salacity. Second was this film, Prince of Egypt *loosely* based on biblical story of Moses. This is an extremely complex story for a children's film. My five year old was appalled as was I with the blatant portrayal of infanticide. While part of the biblical story, it was entirely too violent and inexplicable to young children. This is one parent that is done with dreamscape movies, period. END"
5,What I liked about Prince of Egypt...,"I liked it when he put his stick in the water to make it [turn into] blood. I also like it when the stick turned into a charmed snake.From Connor, age 6"
4,Good movie behind a great story.,This is a good movie that gets the attention of young children and can keep it throughout the movie. The best part is that it is based on a biblical story and gets your children to ask questions about God and the Bible.
3,"OK, but pales next to the Ten Commandments","How do you follow Charlton Heston? Certainly not with Val Kilmer! I don't think it can be done with anyone. Even though that movie is years old, it's hard to beat. So much of the story was truncated in this version, that I was constantly disappointed.I was surprised to hear complaints about the religious content, however. I'm not religious either, but what in the world do you expect from this particular story?"
5,Timeless,Medical practice may change and improve but advice and thoughts from Florence Nightengale are as relevant now as they ever were. Nurses today can still learn and be inspired by her.
4,notes on nursing,Notes on nursing transcends time. Information contained is still very much relevant today. The perioperative nurse especially will benefit from principles.
3,notes on nursing,This is a interesting read for a nurse. It reminds you what a exceptional woman she was and how she really got the basics when it wasn't popular or known. I enjoyed this book.
5,A Must For New Wave Buffs,"I'm sure you get chills from hearing ""I Ran,"" ""Wishing (If I Had A Photograph of You),"" or ""Space Age Love Song"" on the radio. But if these songs make you want to go out and buy the album(s) from A Flock of Seagulls, who made these songs, then their Greatest Hits CD is all you need! This includes other cool songs such as ""D.N.A.,"" ""Telecommunnication,"" and ""Transfer Affection."" Best of all, there's a longer version of ""Wishing,"" which is like totally cool! I kid you not, A Flock of Seagulls truly have the Greatest Hits, and then some!"
2,Not quite OK,"Works ok to keep dust off and I suppose basic things like pollen and sap but material was too thin and ripped easily when caught on the edges of my mower (which I would think they'd prepare for given it's designed for a mower).Before it ripped it also got a wet underneath the cover, not sure if that was condensation or actual leaking through but either way the material didn't seem like it was high quality or could keep water out.Attachment string was nice and I've used some of their other products that had much nicer material but not this one."
5,Lawnmower cover review,Bought this to cover a Greenworks 25292 40-Volt 4 Amp Hour Lithium Ion 19-Inch Lawn Mower. This cover fits like itwas made for this lawnmower. Durability- unfortunately too soon to answer this; I am hoping that it it lasts as longas it looks like it should. Worst feature- sometimes it's a little hard to figure out exactly how it should go on- maybe a front marking might be helpful.
3,Does not fit on commercial size mower,"The material of this cover seems durable and well sewn. It even packs up into its own attached pouch for storage. I had difficulty getting it to go over all 4 wheels and stay put. My commercial mower must be bulkier than common push mowers. By folding the handle down the cover does its job. Since the mower will not live in my garage during mowing months, but will be quite visible in my driveway, the more compact look is a bonus...just a pain to reposition the handle each time the mower is used."
3,A decent cover!,Good price and very good quality. Blacker than it looks in the photo. Not sure why they had to attache the bag to the cover (or why you need a bag). The real test will be the condition of the cover after it's been out in the sun for a year or two .... my original Sears bag started to fall apart after 1 1/2 years.
3,"Ok, but could be a lot better","This was bought to cover a small Honda gas lawnmower. It is just too small. It almost fits, but not quite completely over all 4 wheels and deck. Also, the attached bag is a useless feature for us. We don't stuff the cover in the bag while mowing the lawn. It just hangs there on the cover and collects water when it rains. We have had it a few months. It seems to be holding up ok and is waterproof, but dissapoints every time you try to fit it over the machine. Well made for the price."
5,OG Bass...,"In my mind this is Too Short's tightest joint. Beats are pumped with thick bass, rhymes are tight--even today. Too $hort, b*******!!! -Kwanman"
3,Works fine and Name Branded,Didn't notice anything remarkable. Nice cables. Thickness will suit them for behind component or in dash use.
4,JUST A COUPLE OF GRIPES,"Although this is an exceptional boxed set, I was a bit stunned to discover the LIVE disc included here was not the 2-LP Live At Carnegie Hall set, which is yet to be issed on CD. The live version here was from a 1963 concert, and her snappy, sassy one-liners belted between sets are gone. I was also surprised that ""I CAPRICORN"" was omitted from this boxed set. This singer is classy and stylish, and the DIVAS ARE FOREVER video proves that without a doubt. The booklet included here wasn't as picturesque as it could have been. I would have loved seeing original color album covers of all her LPs featured in the booklet. Overall, the boxed set excels, despite hefty price tag!! I'm stuck on Disc #3. Remastering gets a 10 !!"
5,I thought it was Disney at first!,"When it was in the theatre I just passed it off as another childish animation, and, as a teenager, I was not interested in such things. But when my sister conned me into watching it with her I was enthralled. At the beginning, it's style led me to believe it was Disney and I considered sneaking off. However, once the story got rolling I began to get intruiged. I guess the part for me that made be begin to love it and watch closely was the pun that seemed to create itself-""HOLY SHIP!""I've seen reviews that mark this wonderful movie as ""horrible"" or ""lacking story"". All have to say is - the people who wrote those are adults. This is an animation obviously made not for the young, not for the old, but for those in between. I salute Dreamworks for creating animated movies that tweens and teens can enjoy!!!If you are or have a teenager in the house, at least rent this movie. Who knows. I know I'M going to buy it!"
5,The road to El Dorado,"It arrived shortly after ordering...Everything that i expected...and more..excellent service, excellent productAnnie Giusti"
3,The Road To El Dorado,"I loved the movie in general, but was disgusted with the gratuitous sex scene, and the typical scantily-clad woman. Why its necessary to throw that into a kid's movie is beyond me, but I am very unhappy about it. As an adult, I found the movie to be highly entertaining. My opinion is that it never should have been marketed for kids."
2,funny/stupid/weird/disturbing,"As funny as it may sound, the only actual funny parts are all showed in the previews. It also has a lot of stupid humor that little kids don't understand, butadults will find disturbing to see them on a childrens movie. (ex: ""Holy ship!"" , one of the less disturbing parts.) I was really suprised that Disney addad that scene with that girl and whats-his-name. Anyway, cut out the weid parts and skip the prieviews, and you have a pretty good movie. Another fault: The heros are criminals and cheaters, but they get away with breaking the rules. Not a good mesage to kids. I still can't see why it got almost 5 stars?! It was strang!"
2,"Some good information, but terrible reference","This book generally covers many topics well, but DO NOT use this as a reference for those tricky issues or poorly documented features. Often when programming with Access, you need to lookup specific features or functions that either are not covered in the online help or not generally known. Without fail, I never seem to find these sorts of topics covered in this book. If you are a beginner and want a general overview, then this book is fine. If you are a seasoned developer and need a reference book for Access programming, I would definately consider purchasing another book."
3,Like Hector no one!,"The sound is excellent the orquesta oustanding but Mark, voice, is not the Best that i had heard."
3,Great soundtrack...up until track 10!,"I really was enjoying this CD! 9 tracks of 70's style Salsa (something I grew up listening to) done with new arrangements and STELLAR vocals by the swesome Marc Anthony......up until track 10! I really, REALLY wish hubby Marc would be honest with Jen and tell her SHE CAN'T SING! A well written song with a HORRIBLE singer, brings this CD down from 5 stars to a 3! Talk about buzz kill.A high recommend, if you can somehow edit out the 10th track."
5,OUSTANDING,"It's the best. I think Marc did a great job bringing back the old school originals music the made Salsa what it is today. Hector Lavoe is a legend and all those who were part of that great FANIA family. No one else would have given ""EL Cantante"" the justice it deserved like Marc Anthony."
4,Marc Anthony...As good as it gets w/o being a reincarnation!!,I thought the movie was excellent. I can't thionk of anyone else I would like to play the part of this legend. My only criticism off the top of my head was the movie did not fully articulate the crushing emotions Hector must have felt from the various tragedies in his life. As for the soundtrack the only critism would be as other reviewers have pointed out. Anthony (while a master in his own right) tries to emulate the strongest part of another master's game. While Anthony's versions of these songs are pretty awesome you can't and shouldn't compare them to Lavoe's. I would imagine that Anthony did not put his own spin on these classics more out of respect to and his devotion to portraying Lavoe in the same light and style as Lavoe is remembered. I am happy Anthony pursued this project and would love to hear in his words how he approached it.
5,Marc did a great job!,I think Marc Anthony did a very good job considering that you can't really sing all out to Hector's songs. Hector did not have a very powerful voice or a big range like Marc does. So you can tell Marc is holding his voice back. Marc does not really sound like himself. So he did a good job on this cd of not sounding like himself but trying to sing in more of Hector's syle.
2,Are you sure you want to buy this?,"Instead of buying this, you could buy ""El Cantante: The Originals"", a compilation album that has many of the same songs as this, except that it's really Hector Lavoe that's singing them. Seriously, if you had the choice between listening to Hector Lavoe and listening to Marc Anthony doing a bad imitation of Hector Lavoe, why would you buy this one?Anyway, in this album, Marc Anthony does a very bad imitation of Hector Lavoe. If you like Marc Anthony and you have to have all his albums, then sure, you're going to want this one. But hopefully after getting the ""Originals"" compilation (if not a few of Hector Lavoe's albums--and dont' forget to get Willie Colon's, while you're at it!)"
3,da movie wuz kool...but...??,"Why then buy dis? When the real Hector Lavoe's albums are still availiable. Plus , a big ""minus"" one star for letting Jlo sing on dis joint. Marc's a good singer, her, not so much."
3,Good but not great,"I just finished this book and have to say I was a little disappointed. I have read the O'Brian novels all the way thru twice and I guess I was expecting something along the same lines as that in the literary sense. Maybe it isn't a fair comparison.The story telling is good here, albeit a little sparse and hurried. But it doesn't immerse you in the world of Nelson like the O'Brian books do. It reads more like a TV screen play than a literary work. I am such a fan of the period that I will undoubtedly read the entire series. But I would like to let others that are not familiar with the O'brian novels know that if you like the Hornblower series you'll love the O'Brian books!"
3,The First in a great series...,"Maybe not best of the series, it is the first in the timeline and you may wish to read it first. It is set up as a series of short stories, so you can put it down and pick it up later, taking breaks between chapters without the 'flow' being broken. Hornblower is a amazing character, with both merits and some funny flaws, like getting seasick! His character is a balance between smarts and greed, fear of failure and a strong sense of honor. The books follow him as he goes up the ladder of command, each book's scope getting larger and the problems he faces becoming more and more complex.Other books you might enjoy, if you enjoy this series, is the 'Honor' series by David Weber (a sci-fi version of Hornblower, but pretty) and the large hardcover: Stephen Biesty's Cross-Sections Man-Of-War, which is great for understanding the ships and their crew. All the books, including the Hornblower books are something both young adults and older parents would love."
4,A Philosopher for the Real World,"John Searle is one of America's most prominent philosophers. Although he always writes clearly, some of his works (such as Speech Acts and Intentionality) are of an unavoidably technical nature. However, here he distills his work there (and in other places) down to its essence. This work then is an excellent introduction to his thought as well as an excellent introduction to philosophy. Searle is particularly good when he attacks scepticism. I don't, however, agree with his apparent agnosticism [pps. 36-37]."
3,About what I expected,This is a decent book. About what I expected. Gave it a 3 instead of a 4 because editing was a bit shoddy.
5,DON'T SLIP ON THIS,"Keep keepin on and ya don't stop. Neither did KRS-1. All I can say is this is at least as good as Criminal Minded. Some may disagree but the song ""Ya Slippin"" pretty much makes the point. I got a 15 year old memorizing this album. This is B-BOY supreme. Crank this up at a stop light and watch them all sweat. The song Ya Slippin is my personal favorite. Dig Just-ice on the mic in this song. He's the one calling out suckers. By the way if you like this album YOU MUST BUY JUST-ICE KOOL AND DEADLY album also featuring KRS-1. DO NOT SLIP."
5,"Definetly worthy of the ""Classic"" status","It would be easy to assume, as many people probably did, that after the death of long time partner Scott LaRock KRS-One would fall off. However he gave all those critics a fat smack in the face with the release of By All Means Necessary. Although it's not QUITE as great as Criminal Minded (few are), it is definetly a worthy album and is an example of some of the best rap to come out of the Bronx. ""My Philosophy"", the semi-sequel to the first track on Criminal Minded ""Poetry"" (a great track) surpasses its predecessor which is not an easy feat, and is arguably the best hip hop song of all time. Add 9 other great tracks and I'd say you have an essential album."
4,BDP IN FULL EFFECT,"Yo Im a old schooler to the heart and this album you should have in your old school rap collection. ""My Philosophy"" is the one jam I remember playing on the radio back in Chicago 1988 and it blew my mind. The beat and the lyrics and the way KRS-ONE flows on this track is unbelievable. ""Stop the Violence"" was another that would get major air time,but my personal favorite was Illegal Business."
3,so far so good,"I am new to this product - what I can tell you is that it keeps your skin and affected are's soft and relives the itching, but it does not get rid of the problem..."
4,But...Are They Enough?,"Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz Bradbury (Author of Angel Food and Devil Dogs - A Maggie Gale Mystery)This book of ""pure lesbian erotica"" (as it says on the cover) is a 250 page collection of 59 very very short story vignettes that just cover the sexual encounters between two (or more) women and nothing more. The idea of cutting out everything but the ""good parts"" may have seemed like a good plan, (it did to me me at first) but, though the excerpt-like contributions by 59 different authors are well written, most lack the sexual tension and emotional build up an actual story or novel would have. Every character always ""gets lucky"" within one page. No surprises, no hot dialog, no hints, no chance that the page might end without every character getting laid. This book makes you realize that the actual sex acts aren't what makes a good story really erotic."
2,"""The Good Parts""","I purchased this book expecting a pleasurable read. Unfortunately, I didn't get this as a result. Each story is very predictable, the wording (even though the stories are written by different authors), is nearly identical from story to story, and many of the sex acts and situations are very unbelievable. I will be dropping this book at the nearest rummage sale!"
1,no use for it,I thought I was getting the actual snowthrower because I wanted to replace the one I already have. I don't need the snowcab so I can't really rate it for your company but thank you for your time.
2,Very small,The photo in the ad is very misleading as to the size of the pendant and I found no where in the ad as to the size of the stone so I presumed that the size would be similar to what was pictured. The pendant is very small. The quality of the piece is otherwise good just very disappointed in the size.
4,Don't over feed,"I went out of town for a week and immediately fed the turtle when I got back. She usually eats everything immediately, but she did not eat it all and it sat there and turned to mush (but was still floating!) Then the feeder fish would not eat it which is strange because they always used to go after ""ReptoMin"" I fed her again right next to the mush and she wound up eating the new stuff and the mush... It's probably good to buy this cheap stuff (best vale I could find with super saver shipping) and also buy some good stuff for a little variety. I'm no veterinarian though!"
4,Play that funky music England!!!!,"Take it from someone who's been groovin' to funk music since I could walk, This album is the bomb. Listening to songs like Virtual Insanity, and Cosmic Girl you won't be able to sit still. The groove and the beat will lift you off your seat and make you want to dance the night away. Play that funky music England and I'll continue buyin' your albums!!!!"
3,Over rated but still has some cool vibes.,"TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING was massively hyped and won some major awards I believe. It is a healthy mix of r&b soul funk dance house and disco. I like half of this album at most. The opener is great and I also like the slow funk instrumental. Most of the rest sounds like too conscious an attempt to be retro and sound 70's. These guys are really trying to be 'hip' and it's not working for me. It's just too much. It would be fine if the songs were actually compelling, but most of them are not. Pretty dull in my opinion. Bright moments shine thru, but not enough for me to recommend this album. On the technical side, I LOVE the mix-especially the bass and drums. They sound great. Listen to that kick drum! Mmm mmm. I do agree with another reviewer who wrote that this is much better than listening to headache-inducing techno music. Perhaps a collection drawing from all of their albums would be more pleasing?"
2,"Frankly, a one hit wonder","I wanted to like this album, and even tried to convince myself that I would just get used to it. But let's face it. The album just does not live up to Virtual Insanity, the only song on the album worth getting. Just save your money and get the single."
3,Review on Module 5 Essay,"In this day and age parents have lost their sense of right and wrong. Child protective services have interfeared with the way parents discipline their children, for lack of a better phrase, we as American's have strayed off the beaten path. Parents are afraid to punish their kids for fear of retaliation from the government. Also, parents are afraid to tell their kids ""no"" afraid to put their kids in ""time out"" afraid to do all the things that teach them to good contributing members of society. Now of days, all that children are taught is if you scream and cry and make a scene in public your authority figure will eventually give in and you will get what you want, even though you have behaved in the wrong you will still get the rewards of good behaved children, because your mommy or daddy is too afraid that you will make a scene and someone will call the police and report them for child abuse."
3,The most incredible extraordinary superfluous writing-style,"The content is not bad, not technical enough, and, frankly, the book is definitly too short to cover those 60 moons. The main problem, IMHO, is that the text is cluttered with the most incredible collection of vain tentatives to make the story even more spectacular than it is by using all the literary tricks possible... boring, boring, boring."
4,Cute,"Cute Flatware!! Very unique.I love them. But i had to order replacement because half of the knives came dull. (Beware the end of the flatwares handle are skinny, will slip trough dishwasher basket)."
4,Gove is amazing-,"I've seen Gove in concert twice in the last two years here in Dahlonega, and he is just as awesome now as ever! His music is incredible, and he is still dancing in his seat as he plays, foot stomping and all. This cd is fabulous and I play it often...his new ones continue his legacy of great music that everyone can relate to."
3,Worth a reading,"This book is definitely a must read in the canon of American literature. Wolfe, as always, does an excellent job in his journalistic role, placing himself with Mailer and Capote in this area. However, the one unfortunate part of this book is that if you ARE reading it then you ARE NOT currently engaged in reading one of Kesey's own books, which is a shame. If you haven't read Kesey, you must. If you've read CUCKOOS NEST, you have to read SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION. If you haven't read SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION, you have my condolences."
3,Elusive Train of Thought,"I was truly excited to begin the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test after hearing some good buzz about it. Unfortunately, I feel as though I was misled. I made it about 160 some odd pages before I stopped reading in lieu of another novel.Although, to clarify, I do see how many view Wolfe as a revolutionary and a great philosopher of American culture. There were times in the novel where I saw glimpses of genius. However, Wolfe seemed to be his own worst enemy in my opinion. His train of thought was, well ""elusive"" at best and sporadic and fleeting at worst.I also would acknowledge that the book aims to capture a generation that rebelled against tradition, even in its writing style. Yet I do not feel it was done in a way that was able to also keep a fluidity to the novel.Someone suggested reading after a few glasses of wine... maybe I should have tried that."
2,My head hurt worse than when I ACTUALLY dropped acid...,"This is a surprising piece of work. Tom Wolfe writes most of the book seemingly from the view of the Merry Pranksters. However, his tone seems to become distanced and coldly objective as the book concludes. Ultimatly the reader may (if not deluded into thinking the lifestyle a virtual utopia) see flaws and ultimate failure of the lifestyle. I did not find the Merry Pranksters amusing, free, or admirable. I found much of their behaviour to be mindlessly hedonistic, self-destructive, and generally sheep-like in following the teachings of a raving loon. By the end of the book, I had a throbbing headache. However, I think the problem lies not in the writing of Tom Wolfe (for I enjoyed his other books tremendously) but in the subject matter. In conclusion, I am surprised that the scrambled, self-indulgent mind of Ken Kesey was capable of conceiving such a brilliant book as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."""
4,"life in the psychedelic 60's was great, he?","The book was most interesting for me, for some of the envents recounted in the plot were happening in the area I live in. Ken Kesey and the merry pranksters had a cool bus trip, didn't they?? I loved reading about it. Kinda like the Magical Mystery Tour, but before, he? And it was also fascinating for me to read about the Beatles concert in the Cow Palace in San Francisico they went to....most of all, it really happened, and following reading taht book I read Kesey's ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"", which was pretty good too"
3,On The Road (part two),"!!Freeeeeeaky!! (Almost)::::datedSo, Tom Wolfe tries to describe the Hip-Acid-Flower-Love groove. It is effective--SOMEWHAT--though his book blots up extra words and bloats up too many pages (""There is too much distance between the covers of this book."")Kerouac was accused of typing--instead of writing--in creation of ""On The Road"". And since this is but a sequel to ""On the Road"". . .(Neal Cassady is really in this book!). . . Wolfe is guilty of. . .too much typing {[(and too much TyPeSeTTing here)]}. . .but he does write, too. . .effectively enough so I, think, I don't need to try LSD. Effectively enough, so I become nostolgic, at times, for that time of Haight-Ashbury, for that time of innocent experimentation, for that time of ""braless breasts jiggling and cupcake bottoms wiggling"" (that's Wolfe!). . .. . .but enough after 200ish pages; I want to be out of Wonderland. . .out of the pudding. . .off the bus. . ."
2,condition,"The book was in pretty bad condition, definitely read over a good dozen times. But what do you expect when you order a book sight unseen."
3,Not what the title says,"I purchased this book based on the title, which lead me to believe it would be about programming dynamic character animation. In actuality, it's a beginning 3D programming and math book for somewhat experienced programmers. It does have very good coverage of bones and quaternions and the whole book is written to be very accessable with good examples and illustrations. There is nothing, however, on dynamic character animation (dynamic in either sense) which was really disappointing (and misleading.)"
1,Misleading title,"The main problem with this book is that it simply does not spend nearly enough time on the subject it claims to cover - namly programming character animation.The book contains 11 chapters, total around 286 pages, however only chapter 8, about 23 pages is actually worth reading. The rest of the book is very disappointing. While one could argue that the 2 chapters on matrices/quaternions is useful, this information could be found in any game/math book/website.Examples of useless stuff: chapter on User Interface(heh), chapter on initializing D3D/Opengl, chapter on macros, and worst of all, the stuff talking about what a linked-list is(wtf)I wish the author simply released this as a PDF online, because the little useful information here isn't worth a whole book."
2,Beautiful...but problems.,"The earrings were very beautiful as they came out of the box. One was perfect, the other, all the garnets were losse in their settings and two even fell out. Not very happy with them."
3,Garnets are pink,"These would've been a good bargain, but I am not happy with the garnets. The stones are very light in color...almost a pinky orange. I bought them for a gift, so will probably still give them, but am a little disappointed"
2,Disappointing,"The long-awaited new solo album from Daniel Ash is very disappointing. Three tracks are excellent, namely ""Spooky,"" ""Burning Man,"" and ""Walk On The Moon."" The rest of the album is seriously lacking in melody and interest. Glimpses of brilliance shine through -- a bassline here, a guitar hook there -- but too much of the album is formless techno. I'm not opposed to Daniel's techno direction -- ""Hot Trip to Heaven"" and ""Lift"" are my two favorite Love and Rockets albums, in fact. But those albums had far more compelling SONGS, while too much of this album is simply beats without any distinguishing features. His previous solo albums and Tones on Tail releases are far superior.Buy it if you're a fan -- the three great tracks make it worthwhile -- but don't expect much. This easily surpasses ""Sweet F.A."" in being the least rewarding album that D.A. has ever been involved with."
2,"Why, Daniel, Why?","Sad. Just sad. At this point, Daniel Ash appears to just be going through the motions. The cover of Spooky is nice, but seems like a throwaway embedded in a series of forced tunes. I saw him here in DC and he didn't even play most of the songs...I think he's tired of being a rock star. I worshipped him for many years, but I think at this point I have to agree."
1,Karaoke gone bad,That about sums it up. Really bad synthesizers and even worse (HOW?) lounge singers try and replicate classic popular movie songs. The result is an unmitigated disaster.
2,Don't waste your time,"This is poorly designed. My children received it as a gift and shortly after, things began breaking. The dog tag snapped. Then the leash bolts came off (choking hazard). Even if yours does not have breakage, there are thick rubber bands on each wheel which slide off every time the toy is used. This means they will end up either in a child's mouth, the vacuum cleaner or in your cleanup routine to put them back on the wheels all the time. On top of it all, because the height of the item is so tall, this item always falls over when pulled by a child.I even called the company to tell them they needed to use rubber wheels or to adhere the bands on the wheels permanently and their response was that the bands are not a choking hazard as they pass the ""size"" test requirement. So much for wanting to improve the product!! Too bad because the toy is really cute, but that is the only thing its got going for it!"
3,Worth $10? Nope!,"Overall, I would say this is ok. It definitely is not worth 10 dollars as it is only a 23 min long episode. Yes only 1 episode for 10 dollars, no thanks. The episode is worth say a $1.50 if it was on Amazon Unlimited or through some other form, but to pay 10$ for no extra features or anything, No thanks. I am a family guy fan and wanted to like this more but it did not cut it for the price."
1,Unneccesary,"Funny episode, but there is absolutely no reason it should be a separate release. I see it as a total money grab on their part."
3,NOT THAT BAD!,It wasn't that bad and should NOT have been banned from TV! Funny though. Added scenes were kinda korny!
3,ONE Episode?,"Okay, let me say that I got this for my cousin for Christmas. Last night, she agreed to let me borrow it. The episode was sorta funny and my favorite part was the part with Stewie and Pool Play. The downside is its the ONLY episode in this dvd. May not be worth buying to keep for yourself but worth lending. Figure that one out. It should've had the 2 episodes involving Stewie vs Bertum. What a pity."
1,Garbage...,"The only thing it does really well is that it turns your wall into Swiss cheese... its erratic and simply doesn't work, avoid the product."
1,Horrible product!,I got this stud finder bundled in with a Black and Decker cordless power drill set. It is pretty much worthless. It will beep every once in a while but then I can move it right back to the same area and it may or may not beep at all. This past year I tried to use it again when hanging up a tool-holding track system in my garage. I ended up finding the studs eventually but not after putting around 7 extra holes in my track system. What a turd.
1,Not so good.,This wood stud finder only works maybe 10 % of the time. I tried it in the garage where I can actually see the studs and it can only find a few of them. Then I tried it in the house and it never detected any studs! I guess my roof on my house is just floating in thin air!
1,Don't waste your money,"I waited to hang my tv for this to come in the mail. The shipping was fast as almost always but when I took it out of the package and pulled the battery tab off, I went straight to the wall, that's when all it did was beep and when it did turn green which was only twice I think, when I went over it again red red red. I returned it for a refund, I think I will just bang on the walls. Better than this product"
1,Sucky Shebang!,I should have wasted my money at the carnival throwing baseballs at bowling pins trying to win a cupie doll instead. This thing couldn't find a stud in a horse stable.
5,Great for mounting ANYTHING to the wall,"I needed to mount brackets for switches and patch panels, and would not have been able to easily find the wall studs without this. It works great."
1,One of the Worst product from Black and Decker,I have got false alrams from this device that there studs and never find it accuratley. I was surprised this is one of the Black and Decker product. I won't recommed this for anybody.
5,ONE OF RORY'S BEST,"IT'S HARD TO PICK A FAVORITE RORY CD BUT THIS COMES CLOSE , HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE do you read me, egded in blue,secret agent. good raw production from roger glover. rory was a master musician"
4,it was a great book,"I read this book because i am very interested in true crime and true stories.I am also a mother and the thought that someone could actually do that as in the Mays case, there is noway for me to fathom the idea of switching babies sick or not. I would love my child no matter what. I believe that the book was well written and Loretta told the case very good. I recommened the book to anyone who has thought of reading it but never did. One thing I have often wandered is, ""what happened after the story was written?"" If anyone knows please e-mail me. Thank you very much"
5,Best work/duty pants,I'm a firefighter and I wear these everyday. They are the best pants Ive ever owned. I have had a closet full of these pants for over 3.5 years and they first pair is only slightly faded and has no tears.
3,"Good quality, but small for the size","Good quality work pants, but be sure to order a size or two larger (waist) than your wear in other brands. The 32x32's that I ordered were more like 29x32's."
1,TOO THICK...MAKE YOU WALK LIKE FRANKSTIEN...,AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE...TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER....AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM.
4,A Good Deal,"Not quite as represented, but functional, and a great price. There is no hotsync button as shown on the photo. Still, it works and ,unlike the palm product, it will charge your phone through the usb cable. To hotsync you will need to pull up the Hotsync program on the palm device and tap the icon on the screen."
1,"Installed correctly, broke easily!","I installed this for my child's birthday party. The siren worked well enough, but the piece of platic that attached it was flimsy and broke after about the 5 or 6th use."
4,excellent but expensive,"why's this movie still so expensive?! it's almost 4 years old, and still 80 bucks! yeah, it's one of my alltime favorites, but this is too much money!"
1,Living in Oblivion,"Living in Oblivion is like the cartoon character on Nickelodeon's CatDog, who has a dog's head at one end of it's body and a cat's head at the other and can therefore never decide which of its opposing instincts to follow. The film, that begs for a plot, undulates insanely between being somewhat amusing and utterly ridiculous. I felt like pulling my hair out when I realized that everything I watched was all a dream - TWICE! As the movie begins to climax and make some sort of meaningful sense, you are all of a sudden staring at a black screen of rolling credits, feeling as if you could honestly pull your hair out. (Maybe you'll wake up and realize that it's only a dream!) The only thing right about this movie is its title. ""Living in Oblivion."" The bottom line here is that there are too many ingredients in the plot and the story line is non-existant. Turn on Nickelodeon instead. You'll get the same effect."
1,dupli color paint sucks,doesnt stick to car seat fabric well and in the end it came out looking like musturd yellow with patches of black. It took me another hour to get 90% of it off. What a waste of money!!!! I also have a video on youtube.
3,KINDA BLAH,"I had expected that the string would glow in black light, but it did only when it was extremely close. Silly string is always fun to play with but I didn't get the result I was looking for."
5,Must own,"This is a film that must be added to your collection. Even if you don't like war, this movie is for you, it address the human spirit, and life in general. It isn't pro war or anti war, it's pro life, and shows what has to be done at times to preserve life. Tom Hanks will bring you to your knees, and the supporting cast is so good, you feel like you know each one of them. This movie should have won every award that it was nominated for, but it didn't, sometimes life isn't fair."
2,Not Even In The Top 50,"I cannot believe that this was even in the top 50. It was an okay movie, but not near the impact of the same company it is being mentioned here with. Who did this voting? What about Apocolypse Now, Hamburger Hill as far as Nam era movies?"
2,"Excellent effects, bad story","First off, the special effects in this movie were simply amazing. It really portrays war as it really looks.However, that's all that's good about it.The actors are horrible, and the script is even worse. It's a very corny movie- for instance, when the P-51's destroy the Tiger tank right on time near the end of the movie. The SS men in the end of the movie were far more skilled in combat than the movie portrays them to be (some say the best soldiers in the world at the time). All the Allied killings of prisoners are lauded as heroic and justified, while the German atrocities are given a far more evil tone. It's no coincidence that the show was very anti-German because the director is Jewish. I'm not saying that what the Germans did was right, but Mr. Spielberg, please don't let personal vendettas get in the way of directing a historical movie.Apart from the special effects, the movie is pure garbage."
3,Read A Good Book On The Subject Instead,"Everyone gets wet over the opening sequence to this movie. Well, there are two problems with it for your consideration:1) It is a totally unrealistic account of the amount of time it took to win the battle of Normandy. To watch this crap, you'd think that the allies took the German positions in fifteen minutes!2) This sequence has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie! You could actually remove it, and the rest of the film would not be affected.By the way, Robert Rodat's script sucks, too. Witness that awful Ed Burns dialogue before the final battle. Also, what's up with ""Earn this""? No one in the history of the world has ever uttered a sentence like that! Total crap."
2,NO CHARACTERS AT ALL...,"People keep wondering how it came that Spielberg took the OSCAR for best director and not best Film also, what is a pretty good rare occasion. The answer is very clear when you watch this movie: there is no plot, no character development, nothing, only war battles (the best ever made, for sure). It would be impossible to win the Best FIlm award."
3,exellent combat scenes weak story,i have sceen this movie three times and i hate to be a movie snoob but this movie is not that good don't gett me wrong the first 20 are exellent all of the combat sceens are extermely well done. the chaeraters are way over the top i found some of the dialouge incredibiley cheesy i really hated the translatoior he was the most annoying charter in the movie. i personally think that the mini seris band of brothers is much better. in the end i would give combat scenes 4 stars and the story 2 stars
3,This Movie Can Carry On Quite Easily,"The Movie Saving Private Ryan can tend to carry on and on very easily. It is in fact a very good movie, but some of the script is not necessary, and the cursing is used throughout the movie non-stop. It gets rather annoying. I also get sick to my stomach in some scenes, but that's the reality of the situation. All three of the stars I have given this movie go to portraying the time period in order to bring history into our living rooms, and that is a wonderful thing."
2,"Graphic & gory, but nothing I haven't seen before.","'Platoon' for the Social Security set. The plot is entirely dirivitive. The action scenes seem real, but way, way over the top, especially the first shots on Omaha beach. This has been filmed a hundred times before, but with alot more feeling and sublety than Speilberg seems to be capable of. As General Sherman said, ""War is hell"" and so is watching this film."
2,what a despressing movie,There is a lot of realistic violence. The acting is bad. Tom Hanks's acting is wimpy. I was not too entertained because the whole movie is so depressing. The movie has nothing to cheer about.
1,American propaganda,"Steven Spielberg made a anti-German propaganda movie ""Schindler's List"" in 1994. Then he made this movie Saving Private Ryan. This movie is terrible, this movie is supposedly realistic yet there's an american sniper in the movie who never misses a shot.. also the German POW's in this movie are not to be trusted because they are evil! If Steven Spielberg wants to show real horrors of the war and real battles then he should make a movie about Stalingrad or Berlin where millions of German and Russian soldiers died.. But of course he is just another Hollywood Jewish director.. if u are an american and enjoy Transformers !! and hate Germans watch this movie.. u will love it..but if u are a person who knows a lot about WW2 then u will hate it."
5,saving private ryan,"This is a great movie, well documented, with excellent acting. I highly recommend purchasing this movie and watching it many times over."
3,Starts strong but loses its way,"What people think of when they hear ""Saving Private Ryan"" is usually two things: The opening assault on Omaha and the realism. I agree that right out of the gate this movie is strong but the Omaha landings have a rushed ""one man army"" feel that soon takes over and then we get into the rest of the film. From here on the movie (in my opinion) starts to fall apart. More and more the realism is eroded until by the ending battle the movie is everything you would expect from a Hollywood blockbuster and the awe from the opening sequence has faded into memory.Don't get me wrong, this is still a fine war movie with many great qualities but it doesn't quite live up to the opening sequence and for all the emphasis on realism it is the lack of it that I feel is the movies downfall."
5,War is hell.,"For anyone who has served in the military, particularly one who has faced his own mortality in the line of duty, the realism of combat portrayed in this movie will rip your guts out. ""Saving Private Ryan"" illustrates the price our veterans have paid for the freedom we enjoy. Admittedly, the film's plot is weak. Nonetheless, the movie is an invaluable testament to our veterans. Let us never forget them. Just imagine yourself approaching Omaha Beach in one of those landing craft. I dare you."
3,SUPERB BATTLE SCENES BUT WHERE'S THE MEAT?,"Granted, the battle scenes did raise the war genre to a new level for their realism. But is that enough for critics to call this one of the best films of the year? Not in my book. Saving Private Ryan lacked a ""substantial"" story. I was not moved as I was after I saw Schindler's List. I found all of the characters to be one dimensional and cliches. Even Matt Damon as Private Ryan was a letdown. There was nothing ""real"" about him. On the other hand, Liam Neeson as Schindler was very real. I found him to be a much more complex and interesting character. I don't think SPR knew what it wanted to be: either an Indiana Jones type of movie or a Schindler's List type of movie. The Academy Awards were right when they gave Steven Spielberg the Oscar for Best Director but not for Best Picture. This movie was not Best Picture material."
2,Too Much Blood and Guts,"What a horrible thing war is. When I took my wife Debbie to this film, I was not prepared for the bloodlust. Do people actually like seeing such gore??? Is this entertainment? I thought the film would focus more on relationships, not on such pure blood and guts.War is Hell on earth. There are better things to concentrate on ... like love! Thanks for letting me vent."
1,Graphic and unrealistic,"The first scene with the bloody bath pretends to impress the viewer, but I don't think it has to be so graphic to make you think of the horrors of the war. The whole plot is so unrealistic and primitive, it can't stand any comparision with Deer Hunter or Apocalypse Now. Something from ""bread and circuses"" series."
4,Awesome War Film,Let me start out by saying that this is an amazing movie! The only reason why it got 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it dragged on and on in a couple of places. It is an awesome movie. This is one of the best war films I have ever seen. Everyone must rent this movie.
4,Good Movie defective DVD,The movie is Great but my copy of of the DVD has a few flaws picture wise that do not show up in the VHS version. I do not know where they came from but some of the copies in the original release are flawed. check the scene at the end of the movie just after the corporal kills the German they released at the radar site. Really a disappointment. I hope Amazon has plans to fix this problem.
1,BE CAREFUL! The actual movie that shipped was NOT DTS!,"The whole reason why you are considering purchasing this particular version of the movie is likely for the DTS sound. While the DTS box was shipped to me, I was dismayed to find the 60th Anniversary edition disc inside the DTS box, WHICH IS NOT DTS. It only supports Dolby Digital 5.1. I suspect this is an issue with the manufacturer and not Amazon, since the movie came in the factory wrap. Your best bet is to purchase this movie used. This is why I only gave it 1 star. Otherwise, the movie is one of the best of all time."
2,"Great for 10 minutes, then kaput","This flick is great for the first ten minutes, then it sputters out ....The costumes and effects are great throughout, but the action was ....The thing that annoys me about this movie is there is not one memorable line of dialogue. ....If you want to see great WW2 flicks, there are lots better than this one. Check out 'Midway,' 'Tora, Tora, Tora,' 'The Longest Day,' and especially, 'A Bridge Too Far.'"
3,"Emotionally impacting, but not enjoyable","I can barely remember this war movie in which war-as-horror is given lots of room to twist our stomachs one more time. The blood is bloody and the gore is gory, and there is attention given to the tough moral choices that soldiers have to face on the ground. For example, an enemy soldier who is spared comes back to murder a comrade, so I'm not sure if there's a feel good lesson for me to tap into anywhere. The cast and crew do a good job, but for some reason, this film just doesn't stick with me. Maybe I'm only interested in blood and guts if I can enjoy a vicarious thrill, and not if I actually have to think about the consequences of violence."
5,Excellent War Movie,"...I found Saving Private Ryan to be an excellent portrail of World War II small unit action. It avoided most references to the larger picture or to the overall stratagy and focused on the fighting at a company level. As for the critisism that it demonized the German soldier I do not agree. Instead I felt it pointed out how war dehumanizes all who become involved. American troops shooting Germans who had surrendered, while Tom Hanks character looks away or letting them burn does not hold well with a John Wayne image. The German soldiers who fought in Normandy were a mix bag of aggressive elit troops and scared conscripts just like their Americian counterparts, and I felt this was brought foward in this movie. The weopons and attention to detail added to the realism as did the slow motion which many vets remember happening to them in the heat of battle. Speilberg has done an admirable job, in making an excellent picture..."
3,Good WW II drama but......,"I like this movie a lot. Saw it in the theater and a couple times on HBO. The only thing I didn't like was the dark film (I geuess that's how you'd describe it). It was all dark and it made my eyes mess up. Besides that, a really good quality flick. Stars Tom Hanks, Ted Danson, Tom Skerrit and many more."
3,The hype exceeds the actual finished product...,"I mean, I'd heard from SO MANY SOURCES that this film was a shoo-in to win Best Picture, so imagine my surprise when it didn't. Then I rented it, and I understood why! Aside from the opening ""D-Day"" scenes of Omaha Beach (which were AWESOME), this was an over-long and somewhat boring film! I've watched at least a hundred war movies in my lifetime, and the plot of this one simply wasn't that great in comparison! The special effects aside, this was NOT that great a film!"
3,Good- but there are better war films,"This film had good cinematography- but it was still both intellectually unstimulating and badly acted. The characters had little depth, and the plot was slapped up to fit the imagery. Want a brutal, intense, horribly true-to-life war film? Get ""Come and See""- miles above SPR. Worth the price- skip this one"
2,"Great start, but that's it","Sure, the Omaha Beach opening was incredible, but how fast can a movie go downhill? Witness the ridiculously canned premise that takes shape moments later. Pure corn, and a nice cliche Iowa cornfield to use as a backdrop for those Ryan boys. When I saw the Sarge packing French dirt into a canister along with the other canisters from other battles, I knew I was in for a whole lot of ridiculously written war crap. Great directing, Steve, but polish that script a little next time. I think the ""Go on without me!"" cliche was about teh"
2,"Nice film, poor story","This film tells nothing of D-Day, counting on the generation of today D-Day, they will think that Omaha was the only Beach, and that WW2 was fought by the Great USA, only. No British, Canadians or Poles. It's not a film or a documentary, it's a blood bath, and not accurate. 8 men defending the second bridge over a river, and air support only arrives at the end, (By the way the RAF were the only airforce using rockets, so again NO RESEARCH) Add the gore to the Longest Day and you have a better film and more accurate. I hate people getting History wrong. It's bad for the ego of a country."
5,Outstanding!,"Ok lets get this said and done with. I hear one more word about it and I will flip. First of all if vet's said it was real and they had people on the set and crew who told them how it was then, by god that was real enough! Now this film was the best of 1998. Why don't people like it? Once again vet's said it was the closest thing that they ever saw on film. They even thanked Spielberg and Hanks plus the rest by giving them patches of the companys they served with. P.S.Clem for your information Spielberg did not make filed of dreams, star wars and forrest gump. Two other diretors did!"
5,Saving Private Ryan,"What a great movie. The seller shipped promptly and the DVD arrived quickly and was in perfect condition...The acting and personal identities, personalities of the people protrayed was fantastic. I had this movie before and stupidly lent it out never to be seen again!! ( why do we keep lending things out?? ) I like for the older kids to watch the film to understand the sacrifices of our fighting men & Woman....What a tribute to America's liberation of Europe...Have you thanked a vet today???.........Freedom has a big price tag, that unfortunately is paid with the blood of men. God Bless America and the people ( and their families ) that serve the noble cause of world freedom!"
5,"I was at ""D-DAY"" myself","the only thing missing was the smell of dead bodys and burning gun powder.BEST MOVIE, IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE ""D-DAY""."
2,over-rated,The first scene shows promise but after that it just gets dull. Skip buying this movie and give your $94 to a disabled veteran's fund or something
5,One of my favorites,"This happens to be one of my favorite films for a number of reasons. First, it has some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. Second, it has Tom Hanks in it, who is known for many other great roles such as Forrest Gump. Third, its historically accurate. These three things make Saving Private Ryan one of the best films ever in my opinion and something everyone should own. There are also great bonus features with this set such as behind the scene footage, interviews with the cast and crew, and much more."
1,Just another boring movie,"This is probably one of the most overrated movies of all time.I'm so glad Spielberg didn't win the Oscar from Ryan.At least it proves there's still fairness left in the world.Do we have to see intense graphic violence in D-Day scene to get educated that war is cruel? I think not.So what happened next??? Our heroes talked,talked,talked, and talked about stupid stories no one wanted to hear.It's painfully boring.The time I spent watching Ryan seems like a century. *yawning*"
5,Fast and accurate!,"I received the blue ray before I expected to! Packaged properly, and in perfect condition! One of my favorite titles. Thank you!"
3,Fascinating opening episode...,"...but the rest of the film becomes pretty predictable after that. A solid war film, but the opening really captures the horror and randomness of battle."
3,Movie Great...DVD Flawed,"I have absolutely no complaints about this awesome film. My complaints are with the DVD pressing itself. I have had 3 copies, all with the same glitch at the 22-26 minute mark. There is a white hazy glare which distorts the picture (flames have lines in them) in this section at the bunker atop Normandy beach. There is also the same white glare distortion at the end of the film where Oppen (Jeremy Davies) arrests the Germans. I pretty much expected a flawless print as all the DVDs I have purchased have been so. I'm wondering how many viewers have noticed these flaws."
5,One of the best war movies ive ever seen,"This movie is awesome but not for kids. It is as bloody as it is good. Especially in the beginning, body parts are flying plus scenes when medics are helping people."
2,Not big enough,"I've have actually purchased two of these snow thrower covers, the second by mistake. Although it claims to cover most two-stage snow blowers, it could not cover my Yardman snow thrower. I purchased a MTD snow thrower cover which was the right size. The Classic didn't go to waste as I used it on my gas power-washer.Having forgotten about the size issue, I purchased the second one with the intention of covering my Troybilt chipper-shredder, which is roughly the same dimensions as a two stage snow thrower. Once again it was too small, and I ended up purchasing a second MTD cover which did the job. I guess I'll use this Classic to cover stacked lawn chairs."
2,"Does the job, but not for long","I'm about to order my third Classic snow thrower cover cuz they don't hold up very long. They fit my Yard Machine two stage snow thrower just fine, but the sun makes the fabric very brittle and subject to easy tearing. Maybe I should only use the cover indoors, but that isn't practical. So, I guess I'll just have to replace them each year - bummer!"
5,A Snow Blower Cover... Not Much To Say.,"Slightly larger than expected, which was good as I was worried about the size for my 24"" snowblower, fits perfectly, only glitch I see is that the storage bag is attached to it (maybe an advantage for some, but I'd rather have it in a separate place). Material is sturdy, looks and feels durable, waterproof as expected. String helps to keep it snug."
3,NOT WRITTEN BY MARY BAKER EDDY!!!,"First, THIS BOOK IS NOT WRITTEN BY MARY BAKER EDDY IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM!!! IT IS WRITTEN EXCLUSIVELY BY TOMLINSON. I have a copy from decades ago. It is a wonderful resource for investigating the Christian Science perspective on the Book of Revelation, and most CS students who take part in any Bible study on this topic probably already own a copy. Mr. Tomlinson was a devoted and loyal student of Christian Science, and well trusted by Mrs. Eddy. This book is considered ""correct"" in its teachings, but it is not directly from the lips or hand of Mrs. Eddy. I can't tell for sure who is publishing the book at this time, but it was originally copyrighted by Mr. Tomlinson himself. The book is a worthy read, so it makes me very sad that it is being promoted so obviously dishonestly."
3,Celtic Ring,"Sizing is off. Had to return and re-order 1 1/2 sizes larger than all my other rings. The exchange was quick with no problems. I have no complaint about quality and it is a pretty ring; however, it feels big and clubby on my hand. Plus, my finger sweats underneath the ring. It is just not comfortable to wear."
5,Playhut Disney Pirncess Slumber bag,"My granddaughter received this item from her twin brother for Christmas and loves it. She brings it with her when she stays at my house, and sometimes it even gets her to bed at night sooner than I expct."
5,Soothing and inspirational,This is my go to for stress reducing music and it also gives my imagination a kickstart each time I listen to it.
5,Very different and cool!,"Someone lent me this CD to listen to. I usually listen to classical music and was hesitant to listen to it- but when I did, WOW! The CD is a pleasure to listen to and very relaxing. I play the violin, and the improvisations in The Music of What Happens absolutely blew me away!"
5,the good stuff,this book is a true masterpiece. Iceberg Slim truly shines as the master of pimp literature. a must for every ambitious young wannabe pimp out there.
3,The foundation of urban literature,"I think the true value in this book is in its becoming the foundation of modern urban literature. The actual text itself is dated and the slang is so hard to slog through I reached a point at which I was wondering whether I should continue or not.If you like this book check out Pimpology: 48 laws of the Game by Pimpin' Ken or Rosebudd: The American Pimp by Rosebudd Bitterdose. Both of these pimps made their names in the 70's and 80's, so the reader should be able to identify more with these authors."
4,"The original, the best","This is a very quick read. Iceberg Slim is a good writer and really get's you immersed. This is alternately described as fiction and non-fiction. After reading it, I can see why. I'm sure it is the author's real story of his life, and a view into his world. On the other hand, as a pimp, he has a pension for exaggeration. In some passages, you start to question if what he's saying is really possible. I think that's the reason the book contains the little disclaimer about it being a work of fiction. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of pimps and prostitutes and surprisingly informative. The slang is from the 20's and 30's and kind of hard to understand sometimes, but the book includes a handy glossary. Pimp is both a page turner, and a significant work. I'd highly recommend it."
4,"Yo I love this book. ""BUT!""",I love this book and all Ice Berg Slim Novels. The book takes place around the 1930's and 1940's my favorite time period. The book will leave you spellbound. Not sure if this cash money associated with cash money records? Cause if so the need they asses whooped for these raggedy ass book covers of Ice Bergs Classic's. He is one of Chi-Towns own and one of Chi-Towns Finest. This is a Great Book! The Book covers look like somebody did a half ass job with photo shop..smh
1,Read his other books...,"First I'd like to say that in large Kiyosaki has some great ideas, and two of his books (the 1st rich dad poor dad and cash flow quadrant) were interesting reads. Unfortunately, this one isn't one of them. If this book was a set of new ideas or even just compilation of other works it would have been pretty good.Sadly, this book just serves as one big advertisement of all of his other products, such as his board game, which he dedicates almost a full chapter for advertising it. There are glimmers of good information, but most of it is very vague.To summarize, I wasn't very happy buying and reading a paperback commercial. I would recommend his other books, but I'm not sure I even have respect for the author anymore."
5,Really Enjoyed It,"Although this book reinforces the topics covered in his earlier books (a lot of review), there are some helpful tips toward the end and it's an easy read!-Richwww.richdadpoordad.us"
1,Rip Off,This DVD is garbage. It is totally unviewable. And all I can hear is something about the Muhamed Ali and Frazier fight in Ziare. I was looking forward to seeing the movie after having read the book. But I guess I can't. At least not from this vendor.
4,How poverty can imprison those who deserve a chance,"From the first minute to the very last Precious is a confronting film. The narrative contains abuse, incest, and poverty, yet amongst all this utter misfortune is a young women named Precious who wants to make the best of her life. She often uses daydreams to escape the harsh realities of her being, and she has a warm good nature. A scene in the movie that is priceless is when Precious introduces John the male nurse (Lenny Kravitz) to the school receptionist, who is constantly frustrated by relationships, and she drops the phone the moment she lays eyes on John. But make no mistake this is a hard hitting film with no rainbows.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,Disturbing Movie,A movie with a very real but very disturbing topic. Abuse in any form should never be tolerated. This is a topic that is difficult to watch but that effects all society.
3,No comparison,"It may have been based on the novel ""Push"" but it does not compare, in my opinion. I read the book and there were some similarities but far from the book. Read the book."
1,The DVD Precious,Would not recommend this seller. Received an email that item was shipped but it never came despite 3 emails to them. Avoid this seller
3,Hard to watch at times (most of it),"Depressing and upsetting beyond belief but I kept watching hynotized. Precious was very lucky in that someone found her to help her. There are millions of girls like Precious suffering through very similar circumstances and very few get that ""certain someone"" to pull them through. Some do it on their own and some need help but most do not get through it. Society has too little resources to help those suffering; too much of our taxpayer moneys goes to foreign aid (maybe the US should file for foreign aid); two useless wars, corruption and waste in Congress and military to spend the money to look after our children. This should be a wakeup call to all Americans to fight back at Congress to failing to help and protect the taxpayers. But the apathy of the American public is even more depressing than this picture."
1,O STARS!,"Ewwwww, even Anna Nicole Smith Marshall wouldn't be excited about watching someone get sexually assaulted by her stepfather. Nasty. Maybe to some this was a ""Powerful"" movie but who did Oprah and Tyler Perry think this would appeal to? Ed Gein?"
2,Sad,"I will give the director of this movie credit for being willing to show such ugly, intense, abuse on screen and not gloss over it. However, I think there was too much profanity. Also, the main thing that bothered me is that I don't feel Precious was properly protected. I mean she told the social worker about some stuff going on in her house and her mom finds out and gets mad which is why they get in a fight. Tell me why is she still living there when she tells a social worker she has a kid by her dad? Also in the end the social worker just gets up and leaves after talking to Precious' mom. I'm thinking to myself why isn't CPS doing their job? Why wasn't she put in a better home sooner?Also, I don't really feel like Precious' character exhibited much of the characteristics of someone going through that much abuse. Aside from the part where she broke down about having HIV, I expected more emotional portrayal from someone with a mother like that who is also the victim of repeated incest"
4,Handy smoothie book,"I got this as a gift for my mom. Both me and her like it, it has some good healthy recipes. Plus its cheap. Defiantly a good buy and works great as a gift."
5,Perfect for my 1st generation Intel MAC,I can only upgrade my MAC to 2 GIGs and these worked perfectly. Seems faster when working with pics and videos.
4,The more soulful side of Millie Jackson,"Better known as a comedienne with a raunchy sense of humor and a singer of similarly-themed songs, this 1986 album by Millie Jackson finds her in a softer, more sensitive state of mind, and the results are generally good, if not overly unique and original. Her husky, smoky voice dominates the ballad ""I Need To Be By Myself,"" she makes at least what I consider to be the second best version (after Prince's own, of course) of Prince's ""I Wanna Be Your Lover,"" and the production is some of the nicest-sounding that you'll hear on an 80s soul album."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I expected this book to be a collection of ""stories"" about the development of everyday items. Instead I read about how and why inventors invent new things. Although this is somewhat interesting, the book has not been work the purchase."
2,Too Slow to ship,I bought this needing to work on a project. It took almost 3 weeks to arrive after paying for expedited shipping. Needless to say I had to use something else and ended up just put it in the refrigerator for the next project because we couldnt wait anymore and were under deadline. Hopefully it will hold up and can be used next time
1,The worst accounting book,This book is the worst accounting text book I have ever seen. It is poorly organized and full of distracting explanations which turn easy and clear points into long and complex stories.Definately supplier-oriented product by MBA professors.
3,Okay,Not as good as expected since there were lots of highlighting. But it's okay as the book didn't have doggie eared pages etc.
2,Purchased from another site,"I purchased this product from another site, but it's the exact same product. I left a review there, but I want to leave one here too. This would be a great product if it was made better. This lasted two uses for me, and then the red brush part detached. No, I wasn't trying to remove back from a tree or anything, just lint and pet hair from my clothes and futon. Save your money, don't buy this product. Buy the sticky rollers, or (I can't vouch for this but) 3M has a brush, I'm going to try that instead. If that doesn't work it's back to sticky rollers.."
3,Heavy Duty Screen,"Well made; I would have liked more ""reflective"" properties on the actual screen (it's a nice plain white, but has no reflective qualities like a screen I once owned years ago)."
2,Too Complicated!!,"If I had wanted a thesis on nutrition, I guess I would have looked for one. I found this book waaaaay too complicated (with a chart for everything) which some people like, I don't. I want something simple and easy to follow. You can't figure out what to eat without breaking out the slide rule and going through charts galore. The idea's are good but the execution is decidedly way too complicated. I don't want to have to break out a calculator to figure out what to eat!"
1,Undersized and May Not Cover Hole,"I bought 3 of these. Not one was the full 1 3/4"" as stated in the description. They were all undersized. In addition, the description says they will cover holes 1/2"" to 1 1/2"" wide. My holes are 1 3/8"" wide. Should fit, right? NO: my holes have a downward slope, so the covers sink down--which means any water or debris that lands on the cover will sink into the seam and I would have to remove the cover to clean out the debris or dry the area completely. The product is MISREPRESENTED. For $20 each for these things, they should be right. The Kohler covers I was trying to replace covered the entire hole and enough of the surface that this was not a problem. The paint has worn off the covers I have had for 15 years. The paint wears off ALL THE KOHLER COLORED FIXTURE PRODUCTS. Paint is peeling off ALL MY DRAIN BASKETS, TOO."

5,"I'm the greatest, but not Ali, I'm Kool Moe Dee!","I love this album. I had already heard ""How Ya Like Me Now"" when I bought this, and I actually like this album more. This album contains a funny openeing song, some greatm essages, and most important, dope lyrics. Heres my 1/10 rating for each song:Go See The Doctor 10/10Dumb Dick 9/10Bad Mutha 100/10 (yes, it's that good)Little Jon 10/10Do You Know What Time It Is? 10/10Rock Steady- 7.5/10 (not really feelin this one)Monster Crack 100/10 (The best anti drug song ever!)The Best 10/10I'm Kool Moe Dee 10/10In short, get this album."
4,Uplift a success,"Uplift saved has saved my ego,at least for a while longer! Seat could be padded for better comfort but all in all its a great buy!!! I recommend it to all who have difficulty getting up from the toilet!!"
5,just to clear some things up,"The title Northern Exposure refers to a club night in England. They were really like a series of parties.I used to have this classic two disk set, however it was stolen when my car was broken into. I never got over that. I have purchased disk one seperatly, as thats how the disks were sold in the U.S. It has an amazingly timeless quality and captures that moment right before trance broke on these shores.Disk one is the ""warm-up"" down tempo affair. Ironically its best served while comming down.These are Classics. If you like electronica, you really should have these in your collection. You just should."
2,Covers the right stuff but poorly written,"I was looking for books on stat arb and risk arb and was surprised that not many titles showed up for my search on Amazon. I eventually bought this book (a used copy) and although the book covers exactly the kind of stuff you want to learn about pairs trading, the writing is very poor and there are way too many places where the sentences don't make any sense, regardless of your math/stat background. This book is not a how-to book. It's a general treatise and not a good one at that. I cannot recommend this book. You may want to check out Tsay's financial time series analysis book which, although not specifically for pairs trading, has all the essential materials."
3,A great read,"Just finished James Brady's A Warning of War. It is fabulous read. I could not put this book down, in the end I found myself in trance as the book unfolded. I highly reccomend this book and hope it is one day made into a movie"
2,Warning of War,"A novel, which challenges the reader to sift military fact from pure fiction. For instance, Captain Billy Port's ""relentless pursuer"" Colonel Jessie Irabu of the Imperial Japanese Marines lifted a .50 caliber machine gun from a downed Zero fighter, and mounted the gun on the hood of his scout car. The problem with that is the Japanese A6M Zero was not armed with .50 caliber machine guns, but two 20 MM cannons and two 7.7 MM machine guns. In contrast, the authors description of the 4th Marines marching out of Shanghai to leave China was well done."
3,Rare Earth,"Impressive information. While the evolutionary mindset on the one hand takes away from its authoritative impact on the other hand it makes the subject the more effective because the case is made from a purely materialistic, not religious, perspective. The subject is clearly described to the point that even I can understand it."
1,"Hopefully, this book and its theories are now extinct . . .","This book was assigned reading taking AST 248: Search for Life in the Universe at Stony Brook University. Instead of a plausible, scientific look at the size of the universe and the possibility for life to exist on other planets, this book and the course I took, took an almost steadfast inferential view towards extraterrestrial life based solely on conclusions drawn from far too little evidence. I disagreed with the content of this book, most specifically the fact that planets within a stars habitable zone are rare (what proof do the authors offer?) and that for life to evolve it requires the same conditions that we see here on earth. I actually FAILED the class because I refused to subscribe to the theories (thankfully recently disproven) put forth by this book.I wonder if I should request a grade change 10 years later based on the false evidence put forth in this joke of an academic volume."
3,"""Rare"" Earth needs to be sent back to the kitchen","Experts in paleontology and the composition of interplanetary dust particles speculate about planet formation and the generality of causes operating in evolutionary biology. Badly. This exaggerated view of our uniqueness is as unwarranted as its opposite: that ET intelligent life resides around nearly every star waiting to enlighten us. Speculations about the rarity of extra-solar planets, plate tectonics, a large moon, and Jovian planets are all unnaturally forced to support the author's' glass-half-empty view. But the evidence cited consists largely of a highly selective smattering of theoretical speculations that are superficially understood and over-interpreted. And some facts are even downright wrong (The human genome has less than 100,000 genes, not ""millions""). In the absence of clear evidence pro or con, these authors have simply opted for the anti view. Alas, their final conclusion is unlikely to be proven right or wrong anytime soon."
5,Five Stars and then some more!,This is a jewel of a book. It is a doorway to the essence of life and how precious that life is. I will also recommend Dr. Hugh Ross as another scientist/author for anyone who wishes to continue to explore the utter majesty of the Creation.
2,Silly soldiers,"I purchased this film because my grandfather's brother, Joe August, was the camera man, who later received recognition for his skills in Cinematography in Academy Awards presentations."
2,It's really two and a half.,It was an ok film but I expected allot more. It does have fun moments and if you seen The Temple Of Doom with Harrison Ford than this is a must as a prequel.
5,Bond is back!,"I've loved watching the James Bond movies and reading the James Bond books for quite a while. I've developed my own thoughts of 007 the more I've read. I think Daniel Craig portrayed a very real, down and dirty Bond. I will always love Sean Connery as Bond, but Daniel Craig is now right behind him. I wasn't impressed with Pierce Brosnan's Bond, he was too ... prissy/weak to me.I really enjoyed watching Casino Royale, it was a very quick, hard movie to me. I did miss Q and the banter between Bond and Moneypenny, but it is early yet and I have a feeling they will be back. At least I hope they will be back. I do feel that the movie went by quickly. I liked the action, but I feel I missed part of the story in the beginning. Maybe I just sat too close at the movie theatre ... I'll revise my opinion once I watch the DVD in the comfort of my own home."
3,A Whole New Bond,"Daniel Craig offers a interesting portrayal of 007. I like the edgy, tougher portrayal. The Bonds of the past have all been pretty boy playboys. This Bond is more believeable.The storyline itself moves slow and offers none of the silly female names we are used to. The chase scences are the same old thing. Overall an ok film."
5,Deleted Scenes,"I would give this movie 10 stars if I could, seriously. But since everyone else has already done that, I just wanted to chime in on some of the special features of the collector's edition. I haven't yet watched all the featurettes of the 3rd disc, but I did watch all of the deleted scenes and found them to be pretty meaty. You know how sometimes they are 30 seconds long and very unfinished? That's not the case here. There are 4 scenes, and each one is a complete scene or montage of scenes. All have audio and effects finished, and they involve some excellent acting. That said, however, I agree with the fact that they were cut, as the pacing is much better with them gone. It's up to you to decide if you want to spend the money to see them. The packaging itself is very nice too. Sturdy, classy, and includes some nice photos."
2,What Happened to the Exciting Beginning?,"I've just finished watching this movie, and I rate this 2 out of 5 stars. This has got to be one of the worst James Bond movies that I've seen. The script for this movie was absolutely way off from the James Bond movies that we've been accustomed to. What happened to the exciting beginning, the fascinating gadgets, and the unique cars usually associated with Bond movies? The writers, producer, and director made this James Bond seemed less experienced than the previous James Bonds - more trusting and just a little bit gullible. What happened to the self assured and confident James Bond? The writers, producer, and director all need to go back and review the old James Bond movies. Perhaps after they've reviewed them, they can come up with a winner next time. The only good things going for this movie are the actors and the beautiful settings where some of the scenes were filmed."
4,Best Bond in a long while,"A must see for all James Bond fans as well as new converts. Immensely well done starting sequence and realistic fight scenes make this the most plausible Bond installment. Weak points include a rather draggy romantic sequence towards the end. Overall, a very well done Bond movie with a refreshing take on the Bond franchise. Can't wait for the sequel."
3,Spectacular special effects + Gripping foot-chasing scenes + Not so touching love story = Worth watching once.,Its special effects are spectacular. The foot-chasing scenes are gripping. The thing that lets me down most is the love story. It's not touching at all. I can SEE the two leading characters love each other but I DON'T FEEL their love. I don't know it's because of the acting or directing.It's worth watching once.
5,Best Bond movie yet,Buy it!!! It's the best one yet and it's a sure deal on great entertainment and action!
3,Disappointing,"""Casino Royale"", very un-Bond like, somewhat disappointing. This movie in the Bond series, although I found it disappointing, is by far the most believable in the true to life sense. I suppose I found it disappointing as there were no gadgets from Q.This new actor, he's nice eye candy in his swimtrunks, but other than that, no fire. His accent made the dialogue hard to understand at times. There were awkward moments in the movie where there was no dialogue leaving the viewer with an empty feeling.Judy Dench however, delivered her usual spitfire performance. But it seemed hard to believe that she would have a secret communications device next to her bed. Did you notice the man? Her husband?Another missing element was the ""vodka martini, shaken not stirred"".Scene shifts were not smooth, no explanation of transition.Felix Lighter, totally unexpected appearance.Out of 5 stars, 3 is my rating."
5,Bond on bluray!,Casino Royale is definitely one of the better Bond films. Part of the wow affect comes from it's awesome bluray video quality. A solid choice for all you Bond fans out there.
5,Awesome,"Maybe it is the fact that this was the first movie I have seen on Blu-Ray or the fact this is a Bond film with a new Bond, but I loved it. The action sequences were awesome, they went back to Bond being a spy instead of relying on far fetched gadgetry. Daniel Craig played the part well having the quick wit and the confidence needed to play the part.On Blu-Ray this movie was amazing. The sound was extraordinary and the visuals something to behold. The details were crisp and there basically no artifacts or broken screens throughout the film.The only part about the movie I didn't like was for a spy Bond blew up a lot of things, and seemed to take to violence rather than stealth. Oh well. That's Hollywood nowadays!Can't wait for the next one."
5,Who doesn't love Bond?,"Well I love this movie in the first place! But then to see it in Blu-ray, like watching it brand new all over again! I'm a huge Bond fan, so for this movie to replace Goldfinger as my favorite Bond is saying something! A definite keeper for your collection!"
3,Not even a commentary track...,"I wasn't overly impressed with this movie although Daniel Craig played Bond well. I watched the DVD with surround sound. The music was way too loud and the dialogue was too low. Who mixed this DVD?Some of the action and fight scenes in this movie were great, but overall it moved slowly. Perhaps time for a new screen writing team?I was extremely disappointed that there are two DVDs but no commentary track for Casino Royale.A decent rental. Don't buy unless you feel you need it to complete the set."
1,Don't buy this disc,"It looks like Sony is at it again.There are some strange extra files on this disk, and it won't play properly.A box opens up telling you to press play and the disk will start your player, but it doesn't.After the spanking they received after their last sneaky trick, you'd think they would have learned their lesson.Fool me once , shame on you.Fool me twice, shame on me.I'm getting my money back for this disc, and will never buy another Sony product again."
2,"My name is Bond, Metrosexual Bond...","The longest ever Bond film is, well, too long. There are quite a few drawn out scenes with Bond & his interest verbally sparring. There were about two or three times when I thought the movie had ended. I think they showed Craig's body more than all the women in the movie combined. There was definitely an effort to draw the women to the movie with this one. Real Bond fans are in for a few rough years - All scenes where Bond smoked were cut and Craig later stated he would like to see a gay scene with Bond in the next movie since he feels the audience is ready for this. This is way out of the Bond character and movies. For someone who owns all the movies and has been a Bond fan since a child, this was a hard movie to sit through. Wasn't Timothy Dalton enough to live through in a lifetime?"
1,Disc One of two disc set will not play!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Getting tired of this from Sony.Bought the 2 disc set and disc one, the main feature, will not play on my Toshiba DVD player. THOUSANDS of other DVDs do, but this one will not.It plays on my DVD-ROM on my PC, but I prefer to watch films on my couch in my living room on a 32 inch screen, not at my office chair on a 19 inch monitor.The second disc, the disc with supplemental material, plays fine. But disc one does not. I returned it and swapped it out at the store TWICE in the past 24 hours and I have the same problem each time.WTF????SOMEBODY explain to me why this happens! Is there something on the DVD itself?If the manufacturer/studio added extra files to prevent copying, but they end up confusing the tar out of my DVD player, then you can tell Sony that I will go out of my way to find a bootlegged (read: PLAYABLE) version of this disk ASAP.Sony can kiss my grits."
3,James on blue,"No quiero hacer una crÃ­tica muy profunda respecto a la pelÃ­cula en si, la cual no se puede decir que es una de las mejores de la serie. Sin embargo la calidad del disco blu ray es muy buena, aunque no existan muchas opciones en cuanto a audio, ya que incluye solo dos idiomas, pero existen mas opciones de subtÃ­tulos. Me parece que a este respecto el disco blu ray es suficientemente grande como para agragar mas idiomas por lo que los estudios deberian preocuparse por agregar mÃ¡s de esto.TambiÃ©n se incluye un disco de adicionales muy extenso, asi que si te gustan este tipo de adicionales tienes bastante para entretenerte."
4,Good but flawed,"Really good film that does bring back some of the excitement of the earlier Connery years. Some criticisms: much too long, probably because the ""action scenes"" were allowed to go longer than they should have. When will Hollywood stop relying on stupid car crash scenes that defy the laws of physics -- roll an Aston Martin that many times my friend and you are toe tagged. He could have just run off the road into a tree, been smacked by his airbag, and then found himself in the arms of his foes. Same thing with the stupid crumbling building scene. Please special effects guys, give your audience some credit for having stayed awake in science class. Not ""cinematic"" enough, I guess. Too attenuated an ending, which also made the movie too long. It wasn't necessary to have 4 or 5 lovey scenes before Bond realizes that his girlfriend is in the tank with the bad guys."
4,You might watch it twice to catch all comments and see stunts again,"Awesome stunt work @ start! Near 4 star technically good movie, a bit soggy at the end romance wise with an explanation and no spikes in overall enjoyment. Thus a less than four, still a four star movie , could be possibly a +four due to the Stunts! Rent it, you won't be unhappy, but the movie is (too?) polished, no extreme wows! or sniffs............"
4,Good Movie,"A lot of my friends did not care for this movie, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was nice to get to a realistic Bond movie. It is like watching a different thread of Bourne Identity. I really liked the change in Bond. Comedic in a sense, but all business."
5,Best Bond film since the old S. Connery films,"All I'm going to say is this film moves from the opening scene till the final frame, I wanted to hate this film but I came away impressed with all aspects of the movie including the new Bond, who I hope continues to make great movies.I really believe that the Bond film have a new lease on life."
3,Disappointed,"I missed the old James Bond action from previous movies. Where are the cars with all the gadgets, where is ""Q"", where is a good car chase? Thesethings simply belong into a James Bond movie."
4,Why A Remake?,Like many other people when I saw who was going to take over the role of James Bond I was very disappointed but after the movie I had changed my mind. Daniel Craig is a great Bond. The movie is filled with great action scenes. I only gave the movie four stars because I don't understand why they had to remake an old Bond movie. They should have came up with a new idea since it is a new James Bond. Overall the movie is great.
3,Too long,"Movie was too long, they coulc have cut part of it. Also sometimes hard to follow and hard to hear or understand what is being said."
3,Just OK,Not a big fan of Daniel Craig in this role. Takes himself too seriously. Prior Bond actors appeared more comfortable in the role and were able to use sarcasm and wit more effectively.
5,Excellent film,"I seem to be going backwards with my Bond movies.The first Bond movie I had ever seen was ""Quantum of Solace"".So I decided to work my way backwards and .....I'm very happy I decided to watch this movie.I really thought the Bond movies would be your typical cardboard cut out action movies.Good guy battles bad guys, gets girl, ect....(rolling eyes)I'm glad to say that's not the case here as ""Casino"" has more twists and turns in it's story than a pretzel.Awesome story.Awesome acting.I haven't seen any of the previous Bonds but I really like Danile Craig.I'd love to know how he got so ripped for this movie, man is he in good shape.What didn't I like?Meh, nothing really.Awesome movie, acting, pacing, score, direction.Everything was done well.Casino Royale comes....highly recommended."
2,The freedom fighters need to learn to diversify,"I can see this movie is trying to sell to some people (e.g. Bush and Fox News lovers), but I am disappointed by the cheap, silly story line and new 007 which has turned the sophisticated and gentleman old 007 into a monster who loves killing people and violence just for the sake of it. This movie seems to try to make it look cool to kill every terrorist instead of bring them to court, blow up other country's embassy, wasting millions of dollars on the way (""do we look like we need the money?""). This will influence young and uneducated viewers to approve the current US foreign policy. The ending is also appalling, it's like a statement saying, money is worth more than anything."
4,A good start,After more than 20 years of not watching any James Bond movies since the god awful License To Kill...Its now looking like filmseries i will watch
1,Fullscreen stinks! WHY would anyone pick this?,"Very odd, this is in a lightning deal (after Thanksgiving) and MORE people are picking the Full-Screen over the Widescreen.This means the picture is getting CROPPED and your not seeing the whole picture. People your tube Tvs are going to die soon and you will have no choice but to upgrade to a new widescreen TV, I advise you to buy the WIDESCREEN edition (you can always zoom in IF there are any black). bars."
1,Slightly overpriced !!!,Starter pack? For what? The poorhouse? LMAOThe $2.98 shipping is a deal breaker.
2,Something memorable was lost in this bond movie,"I would not have gone to the theater to see this bond movie. The missing elements were the women at every destination of Bonds' travels, a memorable villain that packed a intriguing but vicious undertone. It was slow in coming was the relationship between ""M"" and Bond and what was expected of his work ethic. This Bond was not the eye candy that Pierce Bonsnan, Sean Connery and Roger Moore brought to character. This was infinitely a rental not worth the big bucks."
5,Daniel Craig is the best Bond,"Daniel Craig is the best Bond. Number one: he is the hottest Bond. Second: he is the best actor to ever play Bond. Third: I like that this Bond movie did not rely on the gadgets and gizmos; this was a much grittier Bond. This film still has the dramatic chases and action sequences, but I don't miss all those fantastic gadgets. I hope Craig continues to do many more Bond films."
1,Sorry excuse for 007 a real let down!!!,"This is the worst of the 007 films...Daniel Craig is a very sorry excuse for 007.He does NOT fit the persona nor does he look like the 007 that we all have known...From Sean Connery; Roger Moore to Pierce Brosnan all having the ""English"" accent, persona and class of 007...George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton & Daniel Craig all are examples where producers and film makers go cheap and are more focused on profits than on having the very best 007 actor...True 007 fans can see the obvious difference...Lets hope that Daniel Craig will only be involved with one 007 film...Pierce Brosnan still has some years left as 007 and hopefully will be able to reach an agreement with producers/film makers to get back for a few more good films before another 007 search needs to resume...Respectfully submitted...Skip"
3,No cumple con los subtÃ­tulos que indica,"Se anuncia en los detalles de pelÃ­cula que esta SUBTITULADA en francÃ©s, inglÃ©s y espaÃ±ol. En la contraportada del blu-ray indica SUBTITULOS en English, English sdh, chinese, french, korean, portuguese, spanish y thai, sin embargo al poner el menÃº de la pelÃ­cula solo tiene indicado subtÃ­tulo en Thai.Cabe hacer menciÃ³n que de seis blu-ray que adquirÃ­ con ustedes, este es el Ãºnico que no cumpliÃ³ con los detalles anunciados. Gracias"
2,what was this,"What were they thinking? Why what happened to the James bond movies that we've seen? This one out too sea. The music was not a James bond music did not have the girls usually on the screen my big deal at the beginning of James bond music and this guy just doesn't make a James bond there was no, need there was no slip stack or wisecracking marks will drop out of the Moon. what one a disappointment. The producers and directors need to go back to the drawing board and try again and make it right this time. The movie had good action and as far as the acting aires's IP zero in a row and fell one and only with business that I would not have bought it. The rate this two stars"
1,The most dreadful Bond ever,"This new Bond movie is different alright -- different in a worst possible way. All the people in the movies acted as if they were constipating. There are no humors and chemistry between the main characters. There is none of the charm that Bond movies are famous for. Bond looks like a body builder, which takes away all the sophistication and mystery that Bond is supposed to possess. Skip this one."
2,What happend to old James bond?,"I like the old super villans. I liked how the old villans would try to take over a country with an army of super powered mutants. In Casino Royale, the villan was much more believable. Lanudering money to support war lords and rebel factions is something that an MI-6 agent would combat, although not James Bond style. I really wanted to see a movie that would expose a massive network of villans that have coridated a mulit-national effort to destroy/contaminate a massive fresh water supply like the Kinneret (Israel's water supply). But I guess things like that can't really happen after Austin Powers already made fun of it.And I did really like the new James Bond and nearly everything else in the movie except for the ending. For me, it seemed like it should have continued on, but no. That was it, and it was really screaming (to me) to show who the big bad guy on top was.But all in all, MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. These are my opinions, not yours...:)"
4,James Bond,"This was nothing like the rest James Bond's. They were more exciting.This one was not very good, there was not story to it.I think the writer's need to go back to the drawing board.Next time make it more action packed and the edge of your seat type.This one was not. And when you thought there was a story it ends.A new James Bond - Daniel Craig - he is good as James Bond, but this story line was not good at all."
2,"I miss Sean Connery, et al . . .","Okay, I stood in line back in the sixties to see DR.NO and sort of was raised on the 'how shocking' entendres of 007. This new mix of un-elegant brute- force Bond just grates on me. Somehow the editing and scripting seem cut of the same non-Seville-Row cloth.Now the Bond stories seem much closer to every other spy/chase movie. That is plot, much-too real characters and smaller threats to the world.Interesting, within weeks of CR's release used copies of the flick are going for half-price; I think a lot of fans agree with me."
4,Casino Royale movie,I didn't really think the female lead was much of an actress. Typical Bond format. I was a bit bored during the poker scenes
2,Great start but horrible the rest of the way,I loved the beginning of this movie - great stunts - but then it goes downhill from there.
4,"A new man, a new Bond","I've never been a Bond fan, but I watched this movie on the strength of good reviews for Craig's performance and his interaction with Judi Dench as M. I have to say it fulfilled all my hopes. Craig's Bond is less suave and more brutal than his predecessors, but also less sexist. He takes M and the other female characters seriously in a way Connery never could have, which is a pleasure for the female viewer. Real-world technology has caught up to the old Bond fantasies and surpassed them, and so has real-world threat; this Bond operates in a recognizable world of terrorists, billionaires, internet connectivity, surveillance technology. I'll be watching more of Craig's films as Bond and as other characters."
4,Husband loved it!,"If you're a bond fan and like behind the scenes information, etc.. this is definietlya good purchase. My husband loved this movie and really enjoyed watching allthe background commentaries, film facts, etc.. It didn't dissapoint"
3,Daniel Craig,"Compared to the other Bond movies,this one was a disappointment as was dark,dry,& much slower moving. I found all the extras much more interesting than the movie itself."
5,Great DVD,"A pleasant surprise. After being a big fan of Pierce Brosnan, I must say that Daniel Craig is just as good, although in a different way. He is closer to the style of Sean Connery. Good action scenes, good humour and a few glances to the preivous episodes...."
1,DVD is DRM protected and may not play in your player,"Sony's DRM protection will prevent this DVD from playing in many DVD players, and suprisingly several Sony DVD players also. My Toshiba SD-4800 will not play this DRM protected DVD.We were not able to watch the movie, no comment on how good it would have been."
4,How To Make A Spy,"Introducing a new James Bond: Daniel Craig. The story line is old and has even been spoofed by Woody Allen in a film of the same name. Thequestion remains, How do you train a person to be a sanctioned assain?Watch this film and you will be surprised at what it takes to gain thedouble O designation. Judi Dench plays Bond's boss and portrays thisposition with her usual panacity to give a true performance."
5,Humorus look at how Vermonters see the world and themselves,"In America, most people live an urban or suburben life. Then you have Vermonter's, who tend to view the world from a rural perspective. This book is a funny way for outsiders to understand Vermonter's while the Vermonter's poke fun at themselves. As an expatriot Vermonter I can recommend this book as fun reading."
3,Spenser on loan,"I'm reading the Spenser series in order, though only one book per month at most. That means I'll read the good bad and average. Crimson Joy is readable but not one of the best.Spenser is asked by his friend at Boston PD, Captain Quert to help find a serial killer. Hawk and Susan Silverman get involved, but to write more may spoil the story.If you enjoy this series you'll want to read this one."
4,review,I have always loved RBP's books especially the Spenser character I was so sad to hear he had passed but am glad they completed what stories he had started prior to his passing
2,Pretty Exciting,"This addition to the Spenser series as a little hard to get into. The story was rather farfetched - Boston has a serial killer, so the Boston police ask Spenser to find the killer?And of course he is a nut-case, so of course you can guess who his counselor is, so of course we have another somewhat boring Susan is in distress story. She's just his girlfriend, she shouldn't take up so much of Spenser's time.Come on Parker, you can do better than this."
2,You need a lot of cream gravy with this one,"Spenser should've put Susan and her professional ethics in a room with the serial killer and not opened the door until she was begging like young Dr. Frankenstein when he's locked in with the Monster. Then again, maybe it would be the serial killer crying to get out."
3,Not that bad.,The product's quality is ok but just too thin. It worth the price because I only pay $20 for it.
3,"Beautiful sweater, does not say ""cashmere"" on tags","The sweater is beautiful and very soft. It was well packaged and shipped very quickly. The price was great -- a real bargain. My only complaint is there was nothing on the label, nor were there any tags, indicating that it was cashmere. I gave this sweater as a gift (and it was well received), but it would have been better if there were tags and/or a label to indicate the type of material it was made of."
5,"Sensitive, Truthful, Powerful","Gail Caldwell has a magical, sensible way with words that wrap themselves around the reader's heart, hopes and experience. The shock! The sadness! The empathy! The confusion. The peace. But it's more than a matter of generating emotion. It's an achievement in transforming the reader and in the expert cultivation and shaping of the reader into a character participating in the story. I loved the experience of reading (and participating in) this book."
2,This album is worth the price just for the song...,...'My Boyfriend.' And it's the Cucumbers. Try 'em out. They'll fit. ;-)
2,"Good lights,poor vendor",Three strands of lights were delivered. 2 were of a darker shade that the third. One of the three boxes had been opened. Only one had replacement bulbs and fuses included.Sent one strand back for replacement. It took about 6 emails and an equal number of phone calls. A refund was issued w/o further discussion or input that the third set would not be replaced. Had to scramble for a third set locally. Fortunately found a set to complete decorations before Holiday.Cannot recommend this vendor.
1,"Incomplete set was sent, couple of months now and still no solution. Product look great and feels solid (the parts I got). I'll","Incomplete set was sent, couple of months now and still no solution. Product look great and feels solid (the parts I got). I'll see if I can get it fixed tonight, else theyre going back with the headace that trying to get the right parts has caused."
1,not worth it,"It might be ok for shingles during the outbreak, but not for phn. Don't buy it for that."
4,"Post-contact history mostly, but good lists of resources","The book mostly covers the Indians and the land after contact with the English, not much about traditional life. I bought it for the extensive lists of food resources the Indians used throughout the year; in this respect it is the best resource for native foods I have seen."
1,Inaccurate,"After reading the first quarter, I discovered multiple inaccuracies, which could have been corrected by living Hairston decendants who grew up on Beaver Creek Plantation, yet the decendants informed me they were never consulted by the author. If the author fails to achieve accuracy on the living, how is the reader going to trust the historical accuracy?It appears that the author is capitlizing on the issue of ""Blacks and Whites"" rather than giving historical truth."
4,A great text to teach in a postcolonial literature course,"This short but intense novel lends itself to a fruitful discussion of postcolonial issues such as appropriation and abrogation, assimilation and acculturation, hybridity, mimicry, and Eurocentrism. I taught it with considerable success in an upper-division class. The students found the ending disappointing, though.The cultural and linguistic complexity of Trinidadian society and the country's struggle to carve out an identity for itself are effectively captured in the confusion of the orphaned protagonist, Tee, who is torn between the warm but no-nonsense environment at her Tantie's and the 'properness' of life with Beatrice, her aunt who lives in the city."
3,Needed further clarification,"This was a holiday gift. However, I was not aware that there are two ""Steppin' Out"" cds. One has less songs than the other. This cd did not have the specific song on it that the recipient of the gift had really wanted the cd for. The other songs are good, but I just wish I would have known about the differences before making the purchase."
5,Beautiful presentation,"I bought my sister a pretty necklace via Groupon, but it arrived in a plastic bag. Fair enough, considering the deal I got on it, but certainly not suitable to gift in. I was happy to find that you can get jewelry boxes like this via Amazon, and it made for a much more dramatic and elegant gift, as if I'd bought it in a jewelry store. If I buy a necklace for anyone again, you can bet I'll be picking up another box like this for the gifting."
5,Sir Michael,I clearly am a huge fan. That's a given. What I can't believe is that he is not well known on this side of the Atlantic. This cd takes you everywhere in musical theatre. His voice is pure and genuine. He is evidently Lord of the Musical. Worthy of a multitude of stars and many new Michael Maniacs. ....
1,"It could've been great, but.....","This was the album I hate been waiting for Michael Ball to record--an album of selections from musicals. However, words cannot express how disappointed I was in this. The selection is not only predictable (lots of overdone Lloyd Webber), but they have been over-orchestrated to near oblivion. Ball's voice, which was once the best I'd heard, seems to have disintigrated to your basic lounge act. Save your money and go for one of Michael Ball's earlier recordings!"
1,Eeech! This album really stinks!!!!!,"Whoa, this is the worst! Anyone who takes classic Broadway songs and murders them the way this guy does has no right recording CDs. His interpretations of stalwart ballads like ""Last Night Of The World"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" deserve the respect with which they were originally written and recorded. This guy sings every song like it's adult easy listening, the instrumentals are awful, and from these recordings I do believe he knows nothing about the stories from which these songs are gleaned. And although he doesn't have a bad voice, I do believe he fancies himself a Tom Jones of sorts and it is in the Tom Jones style that he performs.(...) Really, this guy is the worst."
4,"Very, very good","I absolutely loved it. I am a new MB fan. The reason I didn't give it 5 star is because Empty Chairs and Empty Tables was not included. I liked You'll never walk alone, Last Night of the World, and I Dreamed a Dream and also Memory. His voice is truly amazing."
1,Sorely Disappointed,"Like many others, I was drawn to this film by the hype and star-studded cast. However, after actually seeing the movie, I was extremely disappointed. Some people found Shrek to be descriminatory and prejudiced. Personally, I didn't. However, the bottom line is IT JUST WAS NOT FUNNY. The humor, despite acclaim from adults and children alike, was repetitive, stale and un-intelligent. No person over the age of 10, would find this remotely funny. It literally brings me to the point of nausea to hear this called ""the best movie of all time."" Unless you find an hour and a half of bathroom humor hilarious, don't buy Shrek."
5,What a great movie!,"The first time I saw Shrek, I thought that it would be another kid movie. Boy was I wrong! This is the first DVD that I have purchased and there is a reason for that. This movie is funny, graphically stunning and full of adventure and bellyache laughs! You can't go wrong with the star-studded cast. I have watched Shrek many times and have not grown tired of it. Now, I will enjoy it on my new DVD player. Because I'm a believer too!"
2,Overhyped and underdone,"Why this movie is getting such glowing reviews is a mystery I cannot unravel. It has some humorous situations, but they never amount to more than a stereotypical punchline or fart joke. At best, it's harmless for your kids."
2,Shrek 3D,I am rating this DVD lower do to the fact that it did not play through my Onkyo system like all of the rest of my 3D movies do.I had to plug it directly from the DVD player to the TV. Some what of a hassle to get at all my equipment just to watch one move.If the manufacturer was trying to prevent copying it was not worth their time as this one is going down to the blanks soon.
5,GREAT FOR ALL AGES!,"This is one of the funniest movie I have ever seen. The comedy just keeps comeing! I couldn't stop laughing! It was the best! Everyone from 2 through 202 will love it, you must buy it, you'll love it. Incase you don't know i'll give you a quick review... A big green org (who's name is Shrek) has a very peaseful life living alone in his swamp untill the king Farkwa banashes all the magical creaters to his swamp. Including a talking donkey. Shrek makes a deal with Farkwa that if he resques Princes Fiona from an evil dragon he will get his swamp back. The donkey comes with him and proves to be a big help. He resques her but they end up falling in love! There is a suprise ending too so i won't give it away but you will like it. It's the kind of movie that 3 generations call all watch together and all love. I highly highly recomend it! BUY IT TODAY!"
4,REAL WIT AND CHARM (FOR A CHANGE),"Sometimes you read a review and wonder if the writer is talking about the same version of the film that you have seen. A case in point is Shrek - how anyone can give this film one or two stars escapes me completely (unless they have round, black ears, that is!)If you thought Antz was funnier and more hard-hitting than ""A Bug's Life"", then you are likely to appreciate this more than Disney's computer-animated product like the Toy Story series.Before I had seen Shrek, I was rather put off it by the publicity artwork, which made it look cartoonish and basic. In fact, nothing on the billboards prepares you for the vibrancy and sharp grown-up humour of this film. And have you ever before seen a cartoon in which the heroine had (in the most tasteful possible way) a genuine female sexuality?I was told I would like this film, and watched it against my own prejudice that told me otherwise. I was delighted."
2,Not very good...,"This movie was lacking any surprises. It was a typical tale that really was not very funny. It does not compare to the Disney quad- Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Mermaid. However, the animation was spectacular. Kudos on that front. But you have to be awake to see it."
5,Shrek mini-review,"This movie is a great kids movie, and will also suit adults, thanks to it's clever humor."
1,Its not that great,"Well,From all the review we have here, i thought the movie is pretty overrated. Its not that great. Toy Story is way better. Even bugs life is better (graphics and story line). The story line is pretty weak here."
1,People who advised me on watching this; PUH_LEASE!,"This movie is not even worth one star! The story plot is cheap; there are too many pop culture songs; what is DreamWorks thinking?There are hardly any characters! The DVD itself focuses more on pop culture than the story, the most important piece in a movie! My friends all told me to watch this movie - well, now, I've watched it, and I hate it! Whoever thinks Shrek is better than Shrek 2 had better check their heads. I like Shrek 2, like so much better!"
1,I stand alone.,"I am, for some reason, the only person on the planet that truly hates this movie. I first saw it years ago with some friends when it was released on dvd. For the first half hour Shrek and the donkey did nothing but argue so I walked out. I understand that movies must have some sort of hardship in the beginning to draw the viewer in, but there was no hope for this. I just could not get into the constant bickering. I didn't care. I've never even seen any of the horrible sequals. I don't even know why I am writing this review? Bye."
4,Gr8 Movie !!!!,"This is one of the best animation movies i've seen till date. its not just cos of the animation that has been presented in the movie but the star cast was also very good. the story is very sensible with some good humor. A must see movie for everyone, kids and adults, cos there is something to learn from this movie - ""Never judge anyone b4 actualy knowing them"".. it is our human tendency to judge people b4 actually knowing them inside out."
4,Shrek,This is a classic comedy! A must buy that will keep you laughing all the night through tracking down memories of this fabulous movie. Buy it now for a cheap price to give your funny bones a wriggle and your cheeks a jiggle.
5,Love That Donkey,"This is a Great Movie, especially the Donkey. Everytime he opened up his mouth he busted me up with laughter. Shrek #2 was not nearly as good, but you can't go wrong with this one."
3,"Great video, but extras have rough edges","Shrek is a great movie - very funny! The extra scenes on this DVD are interesting and entertaining. If you're looking for a fun movie (one that you'll enjoy as much as the kids), this is a great choice.However, note that many of the 'extra features' are for Windows only - they aren't available on DVD players or on Macintosh. Also, if you want to see all the extra scenes, you'll need to repeatedly backtrack through the same navigational screens - it gets VERY tedious.I certainly recommend the video, but I think the producers have done a poor job with the DVD, and the packaging and advertising are quite deceptive. Ideally, more features should be available with standard DVD players - and it should certainly be clear on the package that they are not!"
2,THIS MOVIE IS NOT TO GOOD.,THIS MOVIE IS A OK MOVIE.IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE THIS MOVIE WOULD BE OK IF YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.I WILL NOT GO INTO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT SHREK SO HERE I GO.SHREK HAS VERY GOOD GRAPHICS AND IS FUNNY AT TIMES.IS A GOOD KIDS FILM.THANK YOU HOPE IT HELPS AT LEAST A LITTLE.TheLoneRoman2002
1,Don't let your kids see it,"Unless we are aiming for even higher divorce rates, lower marriage rates, higher cohabitation, and even a more moral downfall in our children, this movie is terrible for children. The girl actually goes through with the marriage but then runs off with the Shrek. I'm sorry, in the attempt to not repeat one of the same scenes over and over like that in ""The princess bride"" they decide they actually have her marry and then run off?But for a culture that has decided that marriage is nothing more than a peice of paper, making romantic love much more superior (not understanding that real love is something a person has to learn and develope as they mature. The question when you marry someone one should not be ""will I still love this person?"" rather it should be ""Is this person someone I'd want to love for that long?"") to marriage. Its completely pathetic."
2,3 Stars for the graphics.... 1 for the script.,"I admit, I was tremendously excited to watch ""Shrek"" after listening to the immense hype...However, within a short time into the film I was repulsed by the darkness of the entire script and characters.My first question is: This is supposed to be for kids?Secondly: People actually find this humor funny?This movie does one thing well: takes the ugliest parts of our culture and makes an extremely sarcastic film that adds no beneficial value to your life.Don't waste your time.Parents: Don't let your children watch this terrible, anything but a children's movie."
1,I just don't understand how anyone likes this movie.,"I don't get it. Why does everyone think this movie is so great? I hate the characters. Shrek is mean and the donkey is annoying. There weren't any characters that I could relate to and I just didn't like any of them. The plot is okay, but nothing special. Plus it's not that funny. Not crack up laughing, spit out your pop kind of funny..."
2,This Movie Is Too Short!,"Personally, even though it was sixteen minutes long, I thought I would have liked this movie. However, after a year, I've come to realize I was wrong! There was only one funny part in this movie.The plot of the movie is really silly. It is just about Farquaad's henchman, Thelonious, kidnapping Fiona. And it is onlysixteen minutes. I don't know why I ever liked this movie. If youstill don't know why the plot is stupid, here's more:Shrek and Fiona have just married. While relaxing in the forest,Thelonious kidnaps Fiona. Shrek and Donkey set out on an adventure to save Fiona but that all just gets worse when Farquaad rises from the dead to steal Fiona away from Shrek.In comparison to other Dreamworks movies:The Cat In The Hat*****Shrek****Shrek 2*****I did not like this movie because it was too short and again, the plot is stupid. Do not waste your hard-earned money on this short and stupid film, and I don't know why this is a movie. It'ssixteen minutes!"
5,A lot of fun........with style,I enormously enjoyed watching this movie. It is very different from anything I have seen so far. Its humor is well suited both for adults and children (mostly because children don't get the adult humor and reversed). Edie Murphy is the ultimate donkey - I think that this is his best role so far it fits him very well. The happy ending goes a bit too far but that is Hollywood isn't it :-)And I forgot - have you ever seen a female dragon - that is fun!Shortly - must see!
4,"Pretty Good, But Too Much Gross Out Gags","This was a good movie, and I'm a teenager. The jokes are funny on a few different levels, which makes them even better. The animation is wonderful and the music is great too. The plot follows Shrek the ogre trying to rescue a princess so that he can get the deed to his swamp back. Along the way, he meets Donkey, a talking donkey who he becomes friends with, and he falls in love with Princess Fioana. The only bad part about this movie was the bathroom humor. I really think they could have done without it."
4,Fun cartoon,"This movies is a lot of fun. I think it is creative, and it is definitely clever. The only bad thing about this movie is that a good number of the jokes are poking fun at other movies, so they may not be understood by everyone. But it is well done, and the computer animation is excellent. I didn't notice any glitches or rough looking spots. Everything moves almost naturally. Some people and things walk a little strangely, but that is hardly enough to pick at. I would definitely recommend this movie."
2,Shrek Dreck,"One of those rare occasions where I dramatically disagreed with society, I found SHREK to be entirely predicable and, rarely, engaging. The jabs at the commercialization of fairy tales (aka Disneyland, Universal Theme Parks, etc.) were wonderful touches for the adults in the audience, but they were lessened by the idiocy of fart and/or belch jokes. Alas, Eddie Murphy voices one of the major characters for the CGI flick, and I believe he maintains a clause in his contract for a relative number of gaseous jokes.It's definitely worth a view. My tastes in comedy do differ from the mainstream, but rarely have they diverged as widely as they did with SHREK."
5,Excellent !,It's a really excellent movie. My 3-yr old daughter likes it so much that she watches it almost every day since I brought her to the movie then bought a video of the movie for her about one month ago.
5,Great for Kids and Adults,"I'm just a big 'ole kid at heart, but even adults will love this movie. There are silly things (like farts and boogers) that the kids will love. Then there are the innuendos that the adults will find hilarious. It's also a spoof on a lot of the fairy tales that we know and love. Besides, how can you not find the name of the short prince ""Lord Faquod"" funny? Come on! I could watch this movie over and over again. Great! Combining the comic genius of Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy into one movie was a wonderful move and made for a great movie. I would recommend this to children and adults of all ages."
2,I nice shopping list for healthy eating.,"This book offers a nice practical shopping list for healthy eating but that's about it. The rest of the book simply repeats what other books and websites claim about psoriasis and nutrition. The book is based on what I consider to be an unproven theory that psoriasis has its origins in toxins that build up in the body. The book provides no proof of this but simply goes with that assumption and describes foods that could possibly act as triggers for psoriasis flare-ups. The price of the book is relatively cheap and the dietary guidelines will certainly help improve overall health even if they don't have any impact on healing psoriasis. Since very little money seems to be spent on researching the causes of psoriasis as apposed to treating the symptoms, it wouldn't hurt to try these dietary guidelines."
2,Repetitious,"If you want the info in this book, just get Dr. Pagano's book. It has all the stuff this one does about nutrition and much, much more. I actually returned this book."
4,Nice children's book with a happy ending!,"This is a nice story about a young girl who yearns for a home that she can call her own. Janey travels with her father and stepmother to wherever her father can find seasonal work.Her most valued possession is a Blue Willow plate that belonged to her mother, who died when she was young. Finally the family settles in a place where Janey makes friends, but it is inevitable that they will have to leave when there is no more work. When her mom falls ill, Janey departs with her precious plate. This story has a happy ending where good triumphs over bad, and there is a great focus on the love between family members. It's a little sappy, but we can all use that kind of ending now and then"
4,The Best Work Of Billy Ocean,"The best thing about getting old classics, is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen. I may be 23 but I'm very old-school and when growing up all I'd listen to is Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, etc. But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean. Takes me back to my happier years and having fun. There are a few tracks that I don't remember but they are still good, takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era."
4,Great For work,A nice light creamy clear coat. I work as a waitress so having chip free nails is almost impossible! So I love to wear something shear that doesn't show wear and tear too much. Overall a great color.
1,I hate Essie Nail Polish!,"I really have no idea what the fascination is with this brand. I've tried so many shades hoping that maybe the last was a fluke. But, this brand is awful IMO. It's difficult to apply, applies streaky, and chips so easily. I much prefer OPI."
5,Healthy Tummy = Happy Person,This stuff makes me feel so much better. I am amazed. I will never be without it again.
1,Done wrong,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. The book arrived in a timely manner and in the condition advertised - almost. It is illegal to sell an instructor's edition of a book, but they did it anyway. After repeated attempts to contact this seller for a refund, there was no response. I will have no choice but to seek legal action against this company or to just take the hit."
5,Everyone should have one!,Keep one on your key chain. Very bright and even has a feature that allows you to dim the light or have it flash. Low power consumption due to it's smart technology. Feather light and small. The best key chain light I have ever seen!
3,Ends with more questions than answers,"This book was very well written, but the last chapter did not seem to explain many things in the book that seemed as if they were of importance. The answers that were given seemed as if they were there just to finish the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book till the end though."
5,This is a good starter George Winston,"If you are new to G. Winston music, and would like a sampler, this is a good one. It has a variety of songs from his albums. There are also a few tracks from the Plains CD. However, his CD's make musical sense all the way from beginning to end, and that is missing in this CD. He tells stories, and this CD just gives you the bits of his stories. Still, it is a great place to start."
4,onew of the best old school albums ever,"d nice was tight a shame we only got 2 albums from him my favorites are call me d nice, pimp of the year, and the tr8o8 is coming featuring krs 1 miss the old days it's over features dawnn lewis from it's a different world fame if ya'll remember that show yerah she tried to sing her so called co star jasmine guy made an album around this time."
4,Satisfied,The product covers my lawnmower and protect it from the elements ... except for the little bit of water that is always in the tractor seat.
4,lawn tractor covers,"The product was a little lightweight for the price,but looked to be of quality material.I am going to wait awhile to pass a final judgement.The fit was good and the elastic cord at the bottom of the cover made fpr a good fit.I will see how long it last."
3,Old Standby Now Passed Up by Competition,"I've worn these socks for many years and they were okay. They are not the smoothest socks inside, especially near the toe area. My recent experience with bamboo/rayon socks from Florsheim and Nautica indicate that the material in these Gold Toes is not the best for keeping foot perspiration under control or even keeping my feet warm or cool as appropriate. I now strongly favor the Nautica tipped rib socks instead for about the same price."
2,smaller than they used to be & falling apart,"I have bought gold toe fluffies for 30 years, but I am afraid I have to agree with some of the earlier reviewers. Quality has declined. I am especially concerned with the size of the sock. Compared to my previous pairs these are about 30% smaller all the way around and much thinner than previous ""fluffies"" Apparently corners are being cut. I may have to find a new favorite sock. - additional note a month later. These socks have started to fray and come apart around the top edge. Will soon go in the trash, as will gold toe's reputation as far as I am concerned."
2,Not enough cushion,Not enough cushion.I have many foot problems.I was looking for a thicker sock. The sock it self is OK.
2,Holes,3 pair had holes in the sock. I'm not kidding. And 1 other pair had bad run. I should have sent them back.
2,Quality is declining,"I've used Gold Toe Fluffies for many years. Over time the quality has declined. Either they come or they quickly become ""non-fluffy."" Quality decline is apparent as stray yarns arise from the top of the sock before the first wearing or washing."
5,Littel House - season 9,"I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I have not watched them, but did enjoy the originals when they were on TV. She loves the whole series."
5,The 70's had some of the best TV shows ever made!!,"Little house on the prairie & The Waltons 2 of the best shows ever made, compared to the trash on TV today.Back when TV shows had Character, now days all see is sex, drugs and Death.I rate this TV Series 5 of 5 stars!!"
4,Exotic Rare Insight to The Yucatan's Underworld,"I was researching a new book and was looking for information regarding Cenotes, the deep pools of water in Yucatan's sinkholes. There is also a National Geographic series on this form of cave exploration. This film actually illustrates what cave diving is like. The scenes are very majestic. You need to see both works to really understand the underground river system that flows through these sandstone mountains to appreciate what you are looking at. The color was great. The sound track was clear. There are scenes that might make you a little claustrophobic!I think this would be a good primer for anyone thinking about trying this. CAVE DIVING IS NOT FOR AMATEURS!Look for my e-books here on Amazon:""Christmas On Lost Bridge Road"" & ""Romance On Lost Bridge Road"""
5,Great R&B!,"Here is the beginning of Billy Ocean's consecutive hit-making. Four hits from this album include the title track,LOVERBOY,CARIBBEAN QUEEN(NO MORE LOVE ON THE RUN) and MYSTERY LADY. Another memorable song is a cover of the Beatles' recording THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD. Before Ocean,Peter Frampton covered the hit for the 1978 movie soundtrack SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. The other songs are great."
1,Broken case.,"I got this to replace another of the same , when I got it the case was broken and the CD skips. Very dissapointed."
3,nothin' but buckley,"If you have just discovered Jeff Buckley and you want more than Grace and Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk this is the place to start. I've enjoyed listening to this EP more than the full length Mystery White Boy. The first three tracks are spare and subtle; Mojo Pin and Eternal Life in their skeletal forms give the songs new meaning if you've only heard them off of Grace. Je N'en Connais Pas la Fin is beautiful and melodic, a good track to drop in the middle if your burning a compilation. What makes this a three star cd for me is that the last track, a cover of Van Morrison's ""The Way Young Lovers Do"", just irritates the hell out of me (sorry Jeff). All in all, though, a great addition to your Buckley collection."
4,Class is In Session,"If Criminal Minded was a five star album, and By All Means Necessary, a 4, then this album reallly should be get 4 1/2 stars. While not viewed as the classic that By All Means is, I really feel that this is a superior record. Kris gets deeper into his reggae/hip-hop fusion, his ideas seem even more focused, and the production is consistant if rarely spectacular. If you consider yourself a true old school head, you should definetly own this record."
4,Massage oil for a cehap price,The scent for these are great. Spending only $20 on massage oil I wasnt expecting much but they are worth the value.
1,I didn't get what I wanted,"I needed a Yamaha PA-3 or PA-3B and I was sent a PA-3C, which is the wrong voltage. I don't have any idea if it works"
5,A great book!,"I am a fan of the U.S. Navy and especially the Academy. For anyone who wants a glimpse of what life is like there for the Midshipmen, this book is for you. The stories are funny, some sad. You really get a idea of the dedication it takes to make it through a service academy. In one sense, you are a college student - but really you are on active duty already! My hats off to all Annapolis Alumni!"
4,Great first books.,"These books have been some of the first books each of my three children have read. They are small enough for baby hands, yet with clear text and illustrations. Wonderful for a new talker, each book covers one familiar subject and has one word and related illustration per page. Perfect for the baby who can't yet sit still through a story. I wish these weren't special order. I would love to refurbish this set for my third child, as some books have been misplaced or damaged over the 6 years they have been loved."
2,An inferior adaptation of a Victorian underground classic,"Based on the underground Victorian novel, ""A Man with a Maid,"" this film wastes a good deal of time with nonsense like Jack the Ripper hiding out in a hidden room and watching as Jack seduces Alice, the lady who jilted him. Sadly, the results, and the silly 3D gimmicks do little to recreate the erotic scenes from the original novel. Perhaps someday someone will do a proper X-rated adaptation of ""A Man with a Maid,"" but the Groove Room isn't it."
3,Crime Scene book,"I did not know it was a tiny paperback. THIS is entirely my fault. The content is fine, and I bring it with me to Doctors offices, but it is not the reference book I'd hoped it would be. Whose fault is that? MY fault."
3,Bargain?,"At this price, is this book a bargain? Yes! It is not comprehensive (what really is?), but it is surely a god buy, and a good intrduction to basics, what really is a drawback though is that the author is too sure about his things, and with the development of forensics the last five years, some of the info has been outdated, but I still find it a bargain at this price."
5,Great Book!,This is one of the best books i have ever read! I am planing to go in to the career field of forensic science and this book was great. It gives a brief description of the mojority of the common tasks done by a forensic scientist. Very well written and easy to read! I recomend it to anyone who is interested in science because everything in this book can be related to everyday life.
3,Good book but...,"The book is good, except that it could have used an index, to look up certain concepts, e.g., gun shot residue (GSR), and DNA; as well as a glossary of these terms. Perhaps, the author will consider these for a revised edition. Otherwise, helpful in understanding the ""science"" behind programs like ""CSI"" and the soon to be ""CSI Miami"". (That's why I didn't give it 5 stars-lack of the above-mentioned.).. I'd still recommend the book. However, in case my later review didn't make it in Mr. Ragle's criticism of CSI, unfairly, categorizes the producers of the show, and the actors, as not following ""true"" scientific methods, according to him. They may take a bit of ""creative license"" but the forensics are (fairly) sound. So, that's why I lowered my rating by another star."
4,A very good reference,"I find this book very good, and the author clearly has spent time in the woods, learning the info needed for this book. I would have liked to see more info on animal habits, and habitat, but find the book very good. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to spend time in the woods, is a hunter, is a natural life photographer, is a camper, or backpacker, or survivalist.A very good reference.Mark D. Fellows[...]"
3,Solid effort by Nat Adderley,"A nice little 1976 recording for cornetist Nat Adderley, highlighted by a a great title track by Harold Vick. Adderley and saxophonist John Stubblefield contribute blistering solos, riffing off a fine melody. Another strong number is a propulsive jazz-funk tune called ""Funny Funny."""
3,"We Live In A Free Country, i.e. not Canada","As noted by a previous (Canadian) reviewer, this book is written by an avowed racist. it is, however,interesting, well-written, and certainly unusual.[...] Buy the book and form your own opinion."
2,"ok, wouldn't purchase again",I wanted a fireplace and aquarium for my flat screen and didn't research very much before purchased this. I am sure there are better ones on the market. It will do in a pinch.
3,Nothing Fabulous,"One of my first bath bombs. From other reviews, I can say I smelled the lavender strongly, but I don't like the scent. Water didn't change any color, and though the scent was strong, it wasn't necessarily overwhelming enough to fill the small bathroom."
4,Great British Sound,"Even though I grew up in the 60's, I was unfamiliar with this group until I ran across one of their recordings, ""I Think of You"" on a British compliation CD. I liked it so well, I ordered their CD and it is very enjoyable with that distinct British sound from the early 60's."
2,Campaign 2008,"I guess this came out in 01, but watching it in 2008 is interesting, now that Hillary Clinton's campaign is over. This film is over the top in portraying partisanship, and way too preachy about the main character's rights as a woman to be treated like a man. Jeff Bridges is entertaining as the president. Hell, he should probably run. Given recent history like the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings, and such fiascos as the Bush nomination of Harriet Myers to the Supreme Court, the goings on in this movie are not entirely implausible."
1,I would have giving this movie a zero,"I never watched this movie. I don't watch any film about politics that come out of Hollywood. Why? Because Hollywood is biased and extremely liberal and would never make an honest film about politics. Those days are over and have been gone ever since the early sixties. I saw an interview Gary Oldman (one of the best actors working today) did on HBO, where he told the host of the show he didn't like the end result of the film. He said that Hollywood is full of Democrats that have no brains who ruined what could have been a good film. Actually remembering all the praise this film got when it was premiering it made me weary to view this film. And yes I actually believe no woman with a pro-choice belief, a non-believer in Christ and God, and with the political agenda to ""take every gun out of every home in America"" would never ever, ever get into the VP office. She just wouldn't."
2,grotesque,Everyone plays their political games to the hilt here but the well acted story takes a turn for the outrageously absurd when President Jeff Bridges has the nerve to claim the moral high ground. Its all very reminiscent of the Clarence Thomas supreme court confirmation hearings in which Thomas basically denied Congress had any right to ask him any questions. If people such as the characters in this film really exist in our government then Banana belongs before any mention of our Republic.
1,a movie that could make even ME vote for a republican!,"this is NOT a must see. i had looked forward to seeing this since i usually enjoy political suspensers (even silly ones), but this is a stupid bit of liberal claptrap (btw, before liberals automatically dis me, im a mcgovern democrat; i just recognize crap when i see it). joan allen stars as a potential vice president caught up in a sex scandal from 20 years before, with a coterie of good actors giving some of the worst performances of their careers: a tribute no doubt to the director. and there is an amazingly stupid subplot involving another politician who -- oh gawd, im not gonna even go into it, but lets just say gil grissom would have figured himself out in about 30 seconds. i swear, i think this movie was made by people who want to take the vote AWAY from women ..."
5,Well made political film,"I am dumbfounded by all the one star reviews that I have read here. But then it hit me - the ones leaving these reviews are probably just like the Gary Oldman character in the film! I found this film intelligent, riveting and for a film over 2 hours, the time went by fast. Sure, parts of the plot are a stretch but it is by no means a bad film. It is well constructed and the acting is superb. Joan Allen is great, as usual, and the supporting players are all very strong. I'm surprised though that Jeff Bridges got the Oscar nomination for this and Gary Oldman didn't. Oldman is super creepy here and good. Highly recommended for open minded viewers."
1,Forget it!!,"Unless you're a bleeding heart liberal, forget this movie! This is the first movie I've ever sat through that I wanted my money back. If I wasn't such a huge Gary Oldman fan I would have gotten up and walked out. Oldman always plays a really strong character, which is how his character started out in this movie. Then the writer or whoever found it necessary to turn him into a snivling coward which I found completely unbelievable considering the character he was playing. The plot was preposterous, predictable, and infuriating. Academy award material, I don't think so!"
1,Unwatchable,"I sat through the first 30 minutes of this movie. I want those 30 minutes of my life back. Perhaps this movie would be useful to someone suffering from a bout of imsomnia.After reading some of the other reviews here, I feel bad for the people who sat through the entire movie.Don't waste your time."
3,Nice but some sterotypes reinforced,"I purchased the Mommy and Daddy bought and read the Mommy book first and was not thrilled with it because it did reinforce some sterotypcial mommy-things as some other raters stated. I especially didn't like the last page that tells the story of a mommy having a baby brother/sister, which is a nice touch but for some reason seemed so out of place for the theme of the book.I was about to return the books on principle, I didn't even let my children see them. Then, I received the grandma and grandpa books as a gift a very short time later. I love the grandma and grandpa books, so sweet and contemporary for the grandma book (grandmas use computers!).I would give the books for grandma and grandpa 5 stars each and merely tolerate this book, although my children (13 months) enjoy the story/pictures."
5,Knowledge-Be aware!!!!,"I have been looking for this CD for 7 years. I had the CD but had a fire and everything was destroyed. I remember playing this CD over and over and over until I learned all the words to the song knowledge is king. This CD is is not only old school rap but and inspiration to all people no matter what race, color or creed. This Cd is wonderful and everyone all ages should listen, retain and study and apply it to everyday life and it's situation(s). This is the very best CD.Joi from Philly"
5,Epitome of Classic,"This movie sends a call to all those watching, saying, ""Wake up!"". It seems that most of the people that love this movie can also appreciate the profoundness of life. Who else could *possibly* have played this role other than Spacey?? This was his movie. Personally, the passion I hold for this movie is phenomenal."
2,"Great movie, very poor DVD encoding","All the raving about the film itself is well deserved. If you're looking for great DVD picture quality, however, you'd best stay away from this one.The encoding job is horrible, and glitches pop up all over the place. Note the flickering mini-blinds in the for-sale house, jerkily-moving backgrounds during various pans, mirage-like effects on supposedly straight lines. If you're a purist and care about picture quality, you should wait until they distribute a better version. This disc demonstrates how DVD technology is not yet ready for prime time."
3,Unmistakably American &#65533; but not really a Beauty,"It's hard to understand why this movie won a whole bunch of Oscar's. Says a lot about the Pseudoacademic Academy, I guess.Above all, American Beauty is a comedy. There a quite a lot of good laughs in it. The quality of the acting differs a lot from actor to actor, but is generally very good.But the structure of the movie lacks stability. The story does not find itself. Instead, it's a bunch of half-done sidestories which are all typically exagerrated and unrealistic American clichÃ©s.I'm afraid the people behind American Beauty wanted to create a mixture between Sunset Boulevard and Lolita. They do not succeed in this either!"
2,"Creepy, disturbing opus. Excellent actors.","Regardless of how good the actors are -- and yes, they are excellent -- AmBeauty is not for everyone. In my opinion, the Oscars belonged to The Insider ...YOU'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE IF: If you just love it whenever the media probes into the dysfunctional aspects of American suburban life. If you buy the premise that in order to attain true freedom, one must travel the roads of rebellion, of irresponsibility, and of destruction. (Hey, if you buy that, here's a karmic insight: Hollywood and TV gonna make lotsa $ off of you!)YOU WON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE IF: If you can't stand a creepy, disturbing, depressing showcase of moral decay, middle-America style. If you are a rock-ribbed, apple pie, conservative right-winger who believes in white picket fences (in which case, you'd better watch Leave It To Beaver instead.)"
4,A Movie With A Good Ending for a Change,"I have wanted to see this movie the minute I saw the Trailer. It looked like a good movie and when I finally saw it I concluded it is a great movie. It wasn't just one type of movie, it was a comedy, drama and mystery all balled into one. I especially enjoyed all the characters. The characters were people that many people could identify with. Kevin Spacey's performance was outstanding, his performance really pushed my feelings of the movie from good to terrific. I reccommend this movie for everyone."
5,top ten,"American Beauty sits in my top ten movies of all time box. I'm not a movie critic, just an ordinary American movie-goer. There are certain things that I look at about a movie in order to rate it. Did it make me think? Do I remember it long after I've seen it? Does it evoke a strong emotion (happy, sad, fear, etc.) Do I want to see it again and again and when doing so, do I tire of it? Is it visually stimulating? American Beauty is off the charts in each of those categories. It resonates with you long after it's over. It just simply is an absolute must-see movie. Kevin Spacey is such an incredibly gifted actor, as is Annette Benning. Kevin Spacey has the distinction of being in 2 of my top ten movies of all time box, the other being Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing American Beauty yet, it is well worth your time."
2,A cartoon,"The best description of this movie is it is a cartoon. Kevin Spacey seems to be acting with his tongue in cheek. Annette Benning over-emotes to the point of being laughable; the makeup on her lover is so ridiculous as to seem to have been for a high school play. As for the story, Mendez seems to have been making it up as he filmed it, and when he doesn't know what to do next, he throws in a sex scene. Most of the sex scenes are okay, that is they stop short of really grossing you out. I think everyone misread this movie. It seems to aim to be a satire, but turns out just to be a lame comedy. You can't really like anyone in the story, certainly neither of the teen-age girls, who are probably pretty typical, nor any of the adults. The young drug dealer turns out to be the most likeable, and he's got problems. (...)"
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!,"Why, oh why is this movie SO OVERRATED? I don't know why, but I do know that this movie is BAD. Good acting doesn't make a good movie, you need a good script, and they didn't have one. You can tell the story in 2 minutes, so they streched it 2 HOURS!!!Is Spacey good? YES HE IS, but his character is a very simple one, a man that reaches that age where he finds himself insecure of his life, is a cliche, nothing more than that. The director does not give us a background for this, so why would you care for a character like this, and old man that really is a Cry-Baby?, well you wont care for him. And all the other characters are more cliches, but not as good acted as the one played by spacey."
1,Why Is It so GOOD??? I can't figure it out,This movie is the worst movie ever. I can't believe how many people like it. One reason I don't like it is it is confusing and makes no sense at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
3,If you cant relate the movie is somewhat shallow,"Personally, i dont come from one of these wasp homes where the mom and dad stopped loving eachother and infidelity and promiscuity run rampant. Please dont right me off as some religious nut ball because i am an athiest i just have values.In anycase, I thought the movie was ok, but just the fact that it won best picture (over the Green Mile -A much better film-) drove me nuts. I love kevin spacey too, but this movie didn't hit home for me and i dont think a good movie should do that. A good movie should appeal to everyone not just the people who judge the academy awards who come from these kind of families.Anyways just my $0.02"
1,Might as well have been a Pauly Shore movie,"I wasn't bothered by the Pedophelia, as a matter of fact, the only thing that bothered me was the script. The acting is great, the direction is great, it has two or three descent scenes, but none of the will ever be able to save this movie from the horror of itself. If this movie had never been made, I would be just as well off."
1,Overrated and dismal,"The film is really nothing more than a bizzare portrayal of what happens when you mix self-absorbed people who let ordinary evil rule their lives with people who are just plain nuts. None of the characters are likable, and I found myself really not caring what happened to any of them by the end.Why this got such critical acclaim is beyond me- I don't know whether we're supposed to believe this sort of thing happens in America every day (if we're really that far gone, we are in deep trouble) or if this is just supposed to be a black satire of social issues like family dynamics, drugs, and sexuality (if it is, it's not funny)."
2,One of the most overrated movies of the last years,"A corrosive masterpiece, a cruel but realistic portrait of the American family ? No, a movie much more conformist than it seems, full of commonplaces, with an end foregone and unbelievable at the same time.Only good thing is the level of the acting."
2,A bit too much,"I may have missed the point of the movie. It seemed to be a hopeless movie, i.e. no hope for anyone, almost depressing. I guess you have to be in the mood to see it. If you want to see a family disintegrate, then watch it."
1,Perhaps the DVD should work.,"I very much enjoyed American Beauty the movie, and feel confident that other reviews adequately cover its many strengths and weaknesses.American Beauty the DVD is a different story for me. The DVD locks up in my DVD player after the opening screen asking for the audio preference. (The player is a Dolby/DTS JVC purchased in the middle of 1999) Entertaining as the content of this DVD is, its incompatibility with my DVD player is an annoyance. I wish that I had rented first to ensure that the DVD worked in my player."
1,Are you kidding?,"Without question, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Very slow paced, and only occasionally funny. Want to waste two hours of your life? Watch this film."
1,"Facile, over-rated, over-hyped movie","This movie was a great disappointment: not much plot, lots of over-acting, glib and shallow dialogue.Definitely did not deserve to win any awards. Waste of money and time.Pity the lowest rating is on the scale is 1 star; I would've given it a negative rating."
1,It was a Dark Day In America when this movie got an Oscar,"I CANNOT believe someone would make a movie about such garbage. The fact that this movie got an Academy Award is an indicator of the degradation of society. In fact, the only difference between this movie and Jerry Springer is that it did get an academy award. Even on Jerry Springer atleast their is honesty, they confront their problems. I get frustrated everytime someone mentions this movie, which should have never been even conceived of in the first place. God Help us all."
1,don't waste your money,"Once again i bought into the notion that so many critics couldn't possibly be wrong.THEY WERE! Although i agree that the acting was excellent,and there were a few funny moments,the film was nothing more than bunch of pathetic losers that have as much to do with life in the suburbs as Hillary Clinton.Maybe this is what life is like for the elitist Hollywood crowd and their psuedo-intellectual movie critics who tell us that ""this brilliant movie peels away the myth of the happy American family to expose the dark underside of our society"".Can't wait till Toy Story 2 comes out."
1,"Brains are beautiful, as long as they are intact.","This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe it was nominated for ANY award. They people who made it should be ashamed of themselves. I feel this movie is only applauded for its shock value. Someone's brains are blown out, a man lusts for his teenaged daughters classmate, two grown men kissing, a strange father/son relationship involving drugs. I felt the movie was flat and boring. Who wants to watch this dribble the movie equivalent of C-SPAN? What a waste of my time. I love intense movies. Too bad this isn't one of them."
5,Breathtaking,"A lot of people have mentioned that some people will LOVE this movie, and some just plain ""won't get it."" After watching American Beauty, you can really find out a lot about yourself. It's one of those movies that digs down to your heart and opens up a door to a new point of view on life. The characters in American Beauty are the epitome of a few of our modern-day personalities. Most people would think it's pretty odd that a 16-year-old would like this movie. Well, I'm 16 and I love it."
5,One of the best ever...,"I would assume that by now few are unfamiliar with the look at Americana-suburbia. I watched this movie again over the weekend; this is the 1st time I have seen it since before the 72nd Academy Awards. Despite having now seen this movie almost a dozen times, I realize that it just gets better with each viewing. The only unfortunate thing that I can say that is related the movie is that it is unfortunate that Sam Mendes didn't approve DreamWorks to include the original ending on the DVD (showing a court scene)."
1,The worst Best Picture Oscar winner.,"I'm sorry, but ""American Beauty"" is yet another overrated Best Picture Oscar winner. It protrays suburban midlife-crisis in a very smug, ridiculous, and pretentious manner. The characters have about as much depth and substance as those in a TV sitcom. They're shallow, smug, and superficial charicatures. The music, cinematography, and Wes Bentley's performance as the boy-next-door are the only redeeming qualities of this movie. If you want a more honest portrayal of a American suburban family in midlife-crisis, rent Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" from 1980. ""American Beauty"" is really just American trash."
5,Beautiful,A beautiful movie that explains how not every family is what it seems. I love all kinds of movies but especially the deep ones where a person changes and discovers their place in the world. This is a beautiful movie.
3,Video skips and stalls throughout. Very annoying. :-(,"Cleaned DVD, but still freezes and skips. It's very annoying to watch. Had to force it to advance to the next scene, which meant I'd miss some of the scenes. Returning for a refund. Bummer because this is one of my favorite movies. I'll have to reorder from another source. Dang it!!!!"
5,Sometimes there is so much beauty in this world.,"As I sat in the theater, I didnt know what to expect from this movie that had gotten such great reviews. I was used to seeing really good movies but none that truly moved me to cry. This movie, with its realizum and deeply sensetive characters made me realize that people can still write some damn good screan plays. The one break through preformance that stood out, was Wes Bentley (he played Ricky Fitts, the next door neighbor). The words that he spoke when watching ""the most beautiful thing"" he has ever seen (a plastic bag blowing in the wind)made tears strem down my cheaks. And it seems that everytime I watch the movie it makes me cry. The way it was filmed was stunning. The bright crimson rose petles falling from the ceiling, all I can say is that there are so many beautiful things in that movie I am far to young to understand the genious behind it."
5,Perfect,"I will keep this short and sweet. American Beauty is the most beautiful movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Alan Ball's ability to capture the humor that is part of the average suburban joe is truly extraordinary. I only hope this won't be the last ""big screen"" screenplay we see by him."
4,"Campy performances, but a film with a message","This movie is dark comedy, but I still feel that the acting was over-the-top, especially by Benning. This film is a warning to us about the breakdown of families consumed by careers and materialism. That's one of the themes, at least. I like most of the scenes with the girl Angela, notably her cheerleader-performance with the Spartanians, and then near the end of the film when she is all alone with Lester. If the performances were less campy, I would have given it five. The DVD has great sound, but the extras are only average IMO. My favorite parts of this film are the music (main theme/Angela's CD) and the screenplay."
2,"If you want political punk, get Propagandhi!","OK. Either you love or hate the Suicide Machines. I personally don't care for them. The ska on this album is not bad, but the punk is rotten! The message is good, but the vehicle (the music) needs work. I admit, the album has the ferociousness that I like to see in punk, but if you want the ferociousness and the message of the Suicide Machines in a better package, I suggest Propagandhi or Good Riddance. I give the album 2 stars because there are a few good tracks, namely ""Someone"", ""Give"", ""Black and White World"", and ""High Society"". The rest just ain't good."
2,"What Shouda Been Buried, You Mean!","As a film for which I had high hopes, ""What Lies Beneath"" truly disappointed. With stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, as well as killed director Robert Zemeckis, I expected this to be an intriguing, well-acted thriller. That was not to be.Upon initial renting, I found myself bored to death by the slow pacing, the absences of real thrills, and an clichÃ©d premise that had been much better in other films: y'know, the one where hubby has a deadly secret and wifey begins her suspicions. With about a half hour to finish, I returned the tape.Seeing the last quarter of the film recently on its HBO airing, I was no more satisfied by the denouement. Ford seems to sleep his way through the ending and Pfeiffer continues in the ""screaming Mimi"" vein.Even Alan Silvestri's score, in an attempt to mimic the great Bernard Herrmann, is as waterlogged as is the film.To paraphrase Bensen, I ""know"" Hitchcock, and this ain't no Hitchcock!"
2,...,"I don't like scary movies. I don't like them for the same reason I don't like rollercoasters with loops in them. Sure-- I know I'll survive the coaster, but that doesn't make it FUN. Ironically, this movie would have BEEN better if it had been scary.Sloppy sloppy sloppy.The acting was mediocre, the plot was easy to guess half way through the movie, and once the movie ""reveals all,"" it stutters through some subpar slasher-esque scences for about 15 or so minutes of redundant cheap trick camera angles and constantly annoying music.Only watch this to complete your Harrison Ford collectin. There is no other reason for it to exist."
2,Boring,"A boring, mediocre ""thriller"", with unengaging characters, and an illogical plot. By the time you've reached the end, you really have to wonder why anybody is doing what they're doing. The conclusion is really just illogical. You'd think that expensive talent like Ford, Pfeiffer, and Zemeckis could have chosen a better script, and created a much better movie. If you want Hitchcokian thrillers, go with the originals (or even Branagh's ""Dead Again"", a much better thriller)."
5,This movie is just plane SCARY!,"What lies beneath is a tense, twisting, scary ride with nonstop suspense. The people who star in this movie are Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. They play a happily married couple who think they have the perfect marriage when Michelle starts hearing voices and starts seeing things in her house. She tells her husband who thinks its her imagination. But then she starts guessing the story to what she think happened to the person she sees. Then Ford realises that she has guessed to what happened to her and he must stop her before she can tell anyone. This movie is GUARANTEED to keep you on the edge of your seat! It is rated PG-13 for Terror/Violence Sexuality And some language. I give it 5 stars and you will not be dissapointed. Have fun and enjoy!"
4,Great storytelling,What Lies Beneath was a great movie. Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job of playing on of the lead characters in this movie as she discovers secrets from the past. The seemingly harmless Harrison Ford turns out to be something that he is not in the end in a wonderful plot twist. The viewer of this movie should expect a few surprises and a pretty good ending. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
4,"Not bad, Mr. Zemekis....","It has been quite a while since a movie has made me jump from my seat, and this did the trick. Little do you expect the twists that this story takes, and both Ms. Pheiffer and Mr. Ford are excellent in their roles. I know this is a short review, but I don't have much to say except that this is a pretty good thriller and is worth a gander. Watch it with the lights off during a thunderstorm for best results....:) BRS"
3,Soooooooooo scary!!!!,"Ok,first thing I want 2 ask.Why is this film not an 18?!!In comparison to films that are eg.the scream trilogy,it is one of the scariest films I have eva seen!!!I could have coped with most of what happened,but about 30 mins from the end,when Pfeiffer's paralysed in the bath,Ford pulls her forward 2 hug her,she flips her head back and............I dont want 2 give it away,but lets just say I switched it off there and then and refused 2 watch the rest of the film.This could have been an excellent film-but to be able to watch it and not be scared,you need to be reaaaaaaaaaly brave.This film is not for anyone who scares easily.I saw it months ago,and I still can't relax properly in the bath."
3,So much potential...,"What Lies Beneath started out terrific. It got more and more spooky, culminating in the scene where Clair is posessed by the dead girl. After that, it just peters out. The end is too drawn out. How many times can a person almost die, then get up again??? It got old and pretty unbelievable after a while. There was so much potential at the beginning, but they didn't work with it, and I found myself longing for it to end, or at least for Clair to do something smart, like call 911 on the cell phone or beat down the neighbors door while calling for help."
3,Had such potential ...,"What Lies Beneath almost satisfies. It comes close to being a good suspense thriller .... it just doesn't get there.Michelle Pfeiffer plays an empty nester re-married to an overworked Scientist - played by Harrison Ford. They move to a large mansion set amongst secluded land with a lake at the bottom of the garden. Their only neighbours are a seemingly odd couple who help the story get moving. Michelle has much spare time on her hands, and at first, is convinced she is hearing noises and seeing things. Husband, of course, is not convinced. To give the whole story away would be unfair, so I will stop here.I cannot fault the performances of Pfeiffer and Harrison. I can, however, fault the storyline for copying ideas from other films and just getting too ridiculous for its own good, in parts.It will not go down as great cinema history, but at least shows Pfeiffer and Harrison in unusual roles - certainly different from any other parts they have played."
3,"It's suspenseful, but ...","Harrison Ford and Michele Pfeiffer were just weak in this movie. Yes, there were a couple of moments when I jumped and got scared, but I just wasn't impressed with Ford's acting. Pfeiffer just looked glamourous as she always does, but there's no spark in her acting in this movie. I am pretty disappointed as I really like those two.The cinemotology is fantastic though and the setting is a perfect backdrop for this movie. The plot? Weak.Maybe I am spoiled by today's modern horror movies and this was just an old-fashioned scream movie ~~ but something was lacking.I've seen better movies, but this was entertaining enough."
3,THRILLING BUT TEDIOUS,"In spite of the high profile cast and crew, ""What Lies Beneath"" is a fairly traditional thriller all in all. There are loads of scenes that do not serve to advance the story but instead focus on startling the viewers, which makes for a kind of tedious entertainment, if you will. There's no question the movie has some good scares, but the false ones come too often. The actors themselves, coupled with excellent film-making techniques, are what really transforms this from the simple ""Me too!"" films that have come along on the coat tails of ""The 6th Sense."" Harrison Ford is always terrific - even if he always seems like Harrison Ford. He does not often take roles to challenge himself, and yet there are enough twists and turns for him here to understand why he pitched in on the project. Indeed, watch it with the lights out, preferably with company who jumps easily and likes to grab on to you for support - just don't expect TOO much."
2,So boring and predictable...,"...it was almost unbearable to make it to the end. I haven't been writing many reviews lately, but this one was sooo bad I couldn't resist. Visually beautiful, and some real good casting (although I think Harrison Ford wasn't so enthusiastic in this one). The problem was the pacing of the story, and the propostorous yet predictable script. Only slightly more entertaining than watching paint peel."
4,Good Scary Flick!,"Has all the best elements of any great Hitchcock film. It is in the ""old style"" of horror movie that would make Vincent Price proud. Psychological spooky! My only complaint is that it wasn't longer. Definitely worth seeing.Also excellent Bonus Footage including Director's Commentary and also a ""Making-Of"" featurette that shows the computer graphics that went into the special effects. Other stuff too, but the computer graphics stuff wowed me.If you listen to the Director's Commentary (which includes a conversation among the Director Robert Zemekis and a couple of Producers) - they totally kiss his ..., telling him what a great director he is.But the funny thing is - they're right! It's a hell of a good mystery. Get it - you'll enjoy it."
