5,Truly Evil- A Masterpiece,"If you collect Coil, or enjoy Dark soundscapes, this is a must-have for your collection"
5,Wonderful Message,I did a read aloud on this book to 6th graders- They all found meaning in this book and helped showed them everyone is different embrace your unique qualities and others.
5,BUY THIS BOOK!,"My god, this has to be one of my favorite books. When I was a kid, I was FASCINATED (well, I still am) by mechanical things. I must have checked this book out of the library twenty times, and it never got old. It is PACKED with info, the drawings are great, and it is very educational. Well, I was at the library today checking out books for a mechanical engineering class, and there it was on the shelf. I checked it out again for old times sake, and here I am at Amazon.com (to buy my very own copy of course), writing a reveiew. Nuff said. Anyway, if you have a child, boy or girl, old or young, smart or not, it doesn't matter- this book ROCKS!"
2,Wrong Condition,"The listing showed this book to be in new condition, but when I received the book the corners were bent and there was obvious cover wear. Definitely NOT new. Such a shame because I order this book as a gift and I don't want to give a book that looks like I've been carrying it around in a backpack for several months."
5,Great Book,Wonderful book for children--my son carried it everywhere and was always finding new information in it. Very good book for the inquisitive mind.
3,A good book on Sufism,"This was one of the earliest books on Sufism in the Persian language. It is unique in that it was written very early in Islam, disputing the fact that Sufism was ""introduced"" later into Islam. When I first read Nicholson's translation, it was heavy reading, but was worth the while as I was curious about Sufism. So I did enjoy this book, especially because it managed to clarify some particularly detailed aspects of Sufism. However, I *have* subsequently seen a better and more contemporary translation of this book by a practicing Sufi, infact (Maulana Wahid Bakhsh Rabbani). It is much easier reading if you can find a copy."
4,Rick Steves Rome,"Mr. Steves Rome tour guide is, like most of his other books very useful. I always want to know where to stay and have that arranged before I arrive in a city. Rick's useful information helps with that. He has very good ideas for arranging a tour of the city and helps with places to eat."
4,great idea,"Great idea to hang clothes. The hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on. If your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls, the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. The price is great now. I paid $20. Great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer."
4,My second grade class loved hearing this book.,I used this book in my unit on the rainforest with my second graders. They loved hearing about all the animals trying to convince the logger to save the tree.
2,Tough,"This book is a tough read. It drips with research but it belabors the story with information that makes it very,very difficult to follow what happened in this horrible battle. The author for example lists units and military commanders giving credit to everyone and his brother down to a gnat's rump for line after line til you loose the thread of what the heck is happening. Things like Lt.Colonel Smith of the 3rd Infantry,2nd Regiment,4th Battalion, Company C talked to Major Jones of the 23rd Armored Divison, 2nd Battalion, Task Force Williams,F Squad about the shortage of toilet paper. Why not just say there was a shortage of toilet paper and get on with the story. This style of writing, tho flaterring to the people whose names are listed, is agony to read. It is more of a text book than an exciting retelling of what happened."
5,Madden 08,I bought this for my husband and he loves it cannot say anything bad about it. He plays this game for hours building his team and playing through to win the Super Bowel! Recommend it highly!
1,"out of date, innaccurate, out of touch","As an American having lived in Singapore for much of the past 30 years, it seems to me Mr. Hellander hasn't spent much time there. Much of his 'facts' and 'tips' are out of date, or just plain wrong. His 'tips' on hotels and restuarants in particular seem to be based on marketing data, and not real world experience. If you are planning to go to Singapore, there are many other, better written and more accurate, books to read. This would not be one of them. Insight and Essential Explorer do a much better job."
3,response to above,"You didn't miss anything, the names listed are of the editors, illustrator and of the person who did the intro.I haven't actually bought the book yet but plan to. An as far as I'm concerned anything by Pratchett is an automatic 3 stars."
5,"Packed with content, no fluff","The best description I can come up with is ""MBA in a book."" However I think that title has been applied to many books of much less quality so I need something better.McAffee provides an ""in-depth introduction"" to business economics, including competition (as the name implies), pricing strategy, statistics, industry analysis, organizational design, incentives, and more. For anyone looking to get their feet wet in business, or just to understand what the marketing and business guys are talking about (or think they're talking about), this book is excellent!If you're looking for a fluffly book with executive summaries, this is not the book for you. If you want a book packed with content that will improve your nascent business acumen, this is it."
5,Daughter loves this!,My daughter is 3 and she just loves Garfield. She is happy with these shows therefore I am happy with them. Garfield use to be shown everyday on Disney channel and then they just out of the blue stopped running them. That made me mad because my child likes it so much. So I looked on good 'ol Amazon and there they were. All of the Garfield series. So I bought Vol.5 because it had shows that she had not seen. I like Garfield as well so we did good with purchasing Vol.5
4,Tonks are great,We think we own a Tonkinese Cat. Bought the book to see if we really do. Lots of detail in this book. (I think we truly own one of these cats) A real find at the Humane Socieity.
1,A forum for the authors' self-aggrandizement,"Expensive and full of fluff. The authors simply love citing their own work. They do so at LEAST twice per chapter. All the cases in the book were written by the authors and the cases themselves are riddled with meaningless buzzwords and are just downright lame (e.g. ""a lights-out data center""). Small wonder why the non-English speaking reviewer had problems. Poor guy.It's obvious that the only opinions the authors value is their own. Beware of any class that requires this textbook because it means the professor has no idea what they are talking about. Just because you teach at Harvard does not necessarily mean you are smart or intelligent."
3,Not the best out there!,Whlile I really think Szell is great in #40 the really big dissapointment is the slow music in 41 and the performance of the Haffner which lacks the delicacy one comes to expect in this music. I reccommend either Walter or Bernstein in this label or go to the DG version of Karajan to see how much more there is.
2,Some good points but a nasty overtone,"This book does mention some valid points about taking control of your own career. But it fails to acknowledge what motivates us to work and has a horrible over tone that preys on the fear culture you find during redundancies. I'd look elsewhere for motivation, somewhere that tells you how to be more confident rather than ""do this or else""."
1,Urban Legend,"Claim: Candy canes were created to symbolize Jesus, their shape representing the letter ""J"" and their colors standing for the purity and blood of Christ.Status: False.http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/candycane.asp"
5,Wow... simply amazing...,"I've owned the generic cheap earbuds, Koss KSC75, vModa Bass Freq, UE Super Fi 3... nothing tops the UE Triple.fi 10 Pro's (of course, none were as expensive either).These earphones make my 320kbs mp3 and flac songs sound crisp, warm, and addictive to listen to.Pros:While I'm not good at pinpointing that a particular type of headphone/earphone has good/bad highs, mids, lows; I can tell you that these earphones sound remarkable.Cons:Looks like I need to go back and re-rep some of my CDs to 320kbps or flac--- you can definitely hear a lot more where other earphones cannot at these higher bit rates.Overall:I was able to purchase these from an authorized reseller for $238, so for that price, they are definitely worth it. If I had not found such a good deal and purchased these for around ~$300+, I probably wouldn't have end up buying them. But after listening to these and knowing how great they sound, I would definitely pay the normal ~$300."
3,Works but nothing special,"The places where you connect your race number to are further apart than any race numbers I've seen so it kinda makes it awkward. I also don't really like the style of the ""fuel belt"" logo patch it has on it. But it does its job."
3,Never received the belt.,"I received the trisuit and love it. I never received the belt with the order, though. The trisuit was of great quality and I plan on buying more like it."
3,Bridge cards,The card are fine but the pictures on the two decks are too close so that it is difficult to tell one deck from the other.
5,My daughter loves Shaun the Sheep!!!,"My daughter loves Shaun the Sheep and the gang. It is not uncommon for her to have to watch one of these video's at least once a day. It is just good clean fun and the humor, even a 3 year old gets it most of the time. All I know, is if they made different Shaun the Sheep toys, that would be such an easy Christmas purchase for family and friends. (I haven't found yet) And this is a video that you as a parent don't mind watching or hearing even when driving down the road on those long holiday trips."
5,"Too cute! For Shaun fans, kids, clamation fans.",I could not pass this up. The quirkiness of all the Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep stories delights me to no end.Highly recommended.
4,Great printer for the money!!,"I purchased this printer about one month ago to replace my 5 year-old HP laser printer, which finally quit. So far, I have been very impressed. The print quality is crisp and sharp; just as good as a more expensive HP. Although the first page is somewhat slow to print out, once it gets going, the ML-1430 actually prints much faster than my old HP. If you want a printer to supplement a color inkjet or if you print a lot of b&w text, this is a wonderful printer for the money."
2,Paper feeder problem,"I bought this printer about 2 1/2 years ago, and it worked very well...until now. Now the paper feeder will not feed paper at all, making it impossible to print. Also, Amazon's description of 12,000 pages in toner saver mode is A TOTAL LIE, unless you only print 2 words per page. I get more like 2,000 pages in toner save mode until the text becomes too light to read."
2,Problems,"Worked fine in light duty use for about 2 years. Now every page jams as it's starting to load, as described by others here. Not the kind of product quality I want. Will need replacement. Disappointed."
4,"Chemistry of Man (Man series, Second edition)","This book was recommended by a freind, I have looked at it and concluded that it will be a useful reference book"
2,Uhhh refund?,"I got this for my baby bearded dragon, knowing that I am not always home everyday to make sure he has clean water. After a couple months I noticed that the water would get down to empty and not refill itself. Disapointed in my purchase, I removed my cricket guard, did nothing, and tried putting it on an arch, did nothing. Works as a bowl, but not worth it over a normal food dish. SKIP!"
5,Review of Langdana's Macroeconomic Policy,"This book truly ""demystifies"" domestic and global monetary and fiscal policy. The strength of the book lies in the author's ability to not hide behind equations and math but to explain and analyze macropolicy clearly and intuitively. This should be required reading for all members of Congress! I wish I had a book like this while I was in graduate school! Superb!"
2,Stylus Malfunction,"When it comes to handheld video game systems, no company has ever throved like Nintendo. Their latest handheld, the Nintendo DS has been one of the hottest video game systems on the market. Although the game system works well with its own stylus, whenever a third-party company makes a accessory for the DS, it most of the time misses out for gamers. This DS Lite Stylus from Intec definitely follows in that suit. The stylus doesn't work very well with many DS games. It is so unfortunate, that it makes you want to go back with the original one that came with the Nintendo DS Lite. I absolutely suggest that you don't even get this stylus.Price: DControl: D-Overall: D 1/2-"
4,Great Value!,"I originaly was purchasing one bag of the Plato chicken treats from another web site until I found this great deal on the 4 pack! I decided to try the salmon this time and my beagle mix LOVES them!I actually preferred the chicken as the salmon flavor really does STINK! They have a strong fish smell thats stays on your hands. The chicken didnt have this problem. My Yogi loves both flavors but since the salmon has Omega and oils for a smooth coat AND it's cheaper, I've decided to live with the fish smell!I also wanted to add that the seller I purchased from, White Dog Company was EXCELLENT! I ordered these on Wed. afternoon and they arrived Friday morning! I honestly couldn't believe it. It was also packaged very well. Me and my pup were very pleased. Will certainly be making future orders through them! :)"
5,spontaneous buy proves life saving,"i have made many terrible buys in my short existence, but eels made up for every single one of them. over the years i have listened to this cd so many times in its entire entity and e never fails to allow my world-weary mind to drift off into the almighty reverie of sleep. so many of my dreams are captured in each of his lyrical words. listen - sleep - dream . . ."
4,Anybody who wants creativity check this album out...........,"Basically put this is one creative album, I heard so many genres of music on this one album, you just have to leave with respect for this just for the oringinality, a must buy for anyone who likes good music with some unpredictabilty."
1,too general and non-specific,"The book contains a lot of straightforward generalities, but it does not at all succeed in presenting a thorough quantitative approach towards finding pairs and successful trading. The information in this book can just as easily be found on the internet."
5,A fascinating world...,"I just finished this novel and I miss Adam and his fascinating 18th century world already! I became totally engrossed in the societal and religious hierarchies and the conflicts which consequently ensued during this period in Lisbon. I was delighted by the unpredictability of Adam's journey; the unexpected directions the plot took as well as the very complex and real characters found in a historical novel as suspenseful as this one. If you like coming-of-age stories or historical fiction, you will not want to miss Adam Runaway..."
1,don't buy this one!,"NOT the bar pad to buy! It says it fits all bars, but it's really tight, and I can barly close the velcro around it, and that's on the small bar! .. and it's fallen off!The padding is way too hard, too!"
3,good at the beggining,"When i got this book i really loved the beggining when they meet everyoneto when they made omega,their mom died when matt was 12 and jeff was 9 and their father had to take care of them.They first made their own wrestleing ring out of a trampoline."
4,"Less than Interesting...but helpful... C# lovers, Welcome","Honestly, this book contains all the content that any other freesource domain could have. But, I have to be honest... It tries to give DX9 a very interesting point of view, yet, scoring little. It begins by teaching you the basic things, but in a very dense journey (Lights, Camera Setup, Adapter specs, Etc.). The writer did a smart move by using C#. It really helps the book to be sold. I haven't seen any other book that Shows DX9 in C# (Except for a really crappy one at $18).If you haven't ever programmed DX or OpenGL before, this book is a feast... Trust me, you won't regret it."
2,Don't buy from Goodwill Enterprises,"Goodwill Enterprises gave me the run around for the good part of a month. ""The order was held up in customs"". Um, says ships in 3-5 days. Why are you selling items you don't have in stock??? I filed a claim with Amazon and the drums were miraculously on the way. When it finally did arrive, the bayan had a huge dent that looked like someone kicked the side in. It was past the time to file for a refund so I am stuck with them.Both drums are very difficult to tune and keep in tune.My five year old daughter who doesn't know any better has fun with them.If it sounds too good to be true..."
4,hahahahaha @ Rock God (USA),"So the last guy reviewed this - and I'm assuming he wasn't being sarcastic - but he suggested that Shihad should ""change their name back to Pacifier"" and this album is ""basically Pacifier without all the catchy hooks"" and some other stuff. Dude - that's precisely why Shihad is BETTER than Pacifier was. It's just amusing that after all the BS that NZ/AUS fans put Shihad thru for changing their name and sound to Pacifier, that when they go back to their roots, US fans like this guy (all 12 of them!) are now going to give them grief.Anyway, this is my favourite Shihad album in a while. I think it stands up their with The General Electric and actually I think I like it better. I'm gonna go home and listen to this tonight now!"
5,great read,"I have to say, this book was very good. I read alot of books and this book definately kept me guessing. It had twists and turns everywhere. It kept me wondering where this great tale was going to take me next. It was very unexpected. I'm glad the author put it up for ""free"" otherwise I might not have found it. I just finished reading it last night and I have bought the 2nd book in the series. I can't wait to read it. If it is half as good as the 1st, I know I won't be disappointed. If you are a Fantasy book reader, I would say you will enjoy this book. VERY GOOD READ:)"
5,For all fantasy fans,"I encountered this book randomly in a library, but this book is non-stop reading. If you couldn't stop reading in Harry Potter and other books, this may be one like that. Undetedcable plots, unique characters and above all, it is well written! If you are bored, I recomend you to take this book."
2,Pulp fiction,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I found the writing trite. It reminded me of pulp fiction novellas, especially how the author felt obligated to remind us of past action, some of which just happened. The world development was excellent, though the character development was slow. The story line has promise, through the thinly veiled Christian influence was annoying. The author could have come up with a better delivery.All in all, a quick read without much substance."
4,A good teen or young adult read,"I downloaded the this book because it was free. It's a quick and easy read on a sub-adult level. The characters are engaging and I remained interested to the end of the book. I've recommended it to my grandchildren and I'm sure that they'll enjoy it. The author displays what I see as a weakness when it comes to setting the scene technologically, but then I like tech. more than most. The most interesting aspect of Ms Hancock's premise is the idea of the results of moral choices, especially negative ones, becoming visible for others to see in a very specific way. I think that she may be a deeper thinker than many give her credit for. The battle for the meaning of our lives does originate within. What others see is often only the result of what has gone before. And presumptions do blind us as effectively as the religious and cultural prejudices that she writes about. Light fiction, Christian allegory; a good read from an author that I hope to see grow in skill."
5,Hebrew and Aramaic Languanges are breath of God,"As I consider this book is really inspired by God, because for me Hebrew and Aramaic are languages that really originated from God - Himself. So using this as an incantation is really wonderful and very extra ordinary because million of His angels will respond to the invocation and guard and do the bidding of the conjurer. So I hope that all occult student who wants to know the wisdom of God may know his secret and never give to uninitiated idiot."
5,Works good,I use this on my mountain bike that i converted to a electric beach cruiser. Nice ride and very soft.
2,A great book if you already know all about PICs!,"I normally refrain from writing these reviews particulaly if I have a negative reaction. But this time I just have to let the next guy/gal know if for nothing else than to save them a few bucks. In my opinion the author simply could not maintain the viewpoint of someone who doesnt already know the material long enough to convey much of anything usefull. He steadfastly plods along spiceing up his verbage with mneumonics but doesnt bother to tell you what they mean any time soon. His ""this is covered laters"" makes one wonder why the [heck] he introduced the concept if he wasnt going to address it. His lack of address of basics in any logical direction left me spinning. These and the crisp appearance of the text (it looks like it was made on a manual typewriter - and Im not joking) added to the over all impression I had that I had just been [taken]. In short the book [stinks]. Dont waste your money [....]"
2,"Quality Photography and Film. Everything else, low-grade B movie","The photographic quality is solid. The acting and writing are poor. The action fighting scenes are laughable. The plot? Predictable. I wouldn't discourage anyone from renting this, but the big names do not impart first tier production."
4,Interesting movie,I would recommend this movie . I found interesting to watch . I do not understand why some of the reviews are negative it was actually a good movie .
2,This is what happens when Dolph is not the lead...,"Dolph Lundgren is my favorite actor, but my goodness, even he could not make this film good. Dolph plays a barbarian who has a secondary role at best. The dialogue was abysmal. This was the first time I've ever seen a movie where I actually realized that they were using fake props. This was particularly evident during a stoning scene. It was obvious that the person was being hit with foam rocks. I'm also pretty sure the swords during a fight scene were made out of cardboard.Dolph needs to be the lead in any movie he's in. It doesn't work otherwise, except in Rocky IV. The fact that his character didn't even have any personality didn't help either.The one redeeming thing about this movie is that a Christian will find the story/ message good. This does give a positive and uplifting message about Jesus. But even for a Dolph Lundgren film, it has very little merit otherwise."
5,great movie,what a movie and some great actors in it aswell dolph lundgren plays a great role well done son u gota get this movie the fight scene is exellentwell done 20th cent fox .
5,Best Western,"This story held my interest from cover to cover. It fed my romantic horse lover aspect and packed some serious punching (boxing). I have read it over and over again...something I rarely, if ever, do."
4,Fluent and powerful,"Gilels' technique radiates with sheer beauty in this difficult piece. Everything is done in good taste, no mannerisms are present. It's hard to believe that the recording was in front of a live audience.The quality that most jumps out about this performance was the controlled power with which Gilels plays. It is not a percussive loudness. It is strong, singing, and disciplined power that combined with a virtuoso technique, makes for an exciting rendition.I cannot make much of an educated opinion about the Oistrakh performance, but it is very clean and articulate. No screeching is present. The sound is very pure."
2,Violin Solo Off-Pitch...,"[Violin Concerto]There is a serious tuning issue in this recording. Aside from the fact that the entire orchestra was tuned too high (around 448~449 Hz), some parts of the violin solo were seriously off-pitch... It was really hard for me not to cringe at times when listening to this recording..."
4,They're Better than You,"This is a collection of stories about climbing alone. Some of them are well written, some are a bit bland, but all of them are exciting. However, the appeal to non-climbers might be a bit limited, because it's hard to explain climbing's intensity to someone who hasn't been there.""Just don't fall!"" said the soloist to himself.Oh, wait. That's redundant."
3,Not as good as its predecessor,I finished the book but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Black Trillium.
1,Awful - 0 Stars - The end couldn't come sooner.,"I'm surprised there's no option for 0 stars, because this movie would earn that honor.We saw this movie advertised in Maxim Magazine this month, so we figured, what the heck, it's worth a shot.30 minutes into the movie we wanted to shoot ourselves. The acting is horrid. The dialogue is even worse. The actress who was supposed to be playing the ""hot chick on campus"" was nothing to be desired for. I don't understand the DVD cover; it really has nothing to do with the movie. I would have figured this cover art would have fit the movie ""Bring It On"" more.So anyway; there are very things to laugh at in this movie. If there was; they over-did it to the point where it just wasn't that funny.If you want to torture yourself, I urge you to save the $$ and wait for this movie to hit cable/primetime/etc. At least then you can laugh at the commercials that interrupt this poor excuse of a movie.Broken Lizard indeed."
1,A bad romantic comedy,"That's essentially what this film is. It's a wreck. Perhaps there are a few parts that will remind you of Super Troopers, but largely it's dreck.Broken Lizard is pretty much a one-hit wonder. Club Dread may actually be worse than Puddle Cruiser."
3,Puddle Cruiser,"I purchased this movie because Zack Chapman used to be my neightbor in Summit, New Jersey and he plays the Australian rugby player in the film.Also a bunch of coworkers and friends are big fans of the Broken Lizard movies, so I guess to catch up to speed, I would start from the beginning and get thier first movie.It was funny, but I did not find myself laughing out loud all that much. I think the pace was a little too slow, and there was too much conversation without enough comedy (after seeing Super Troopers, I think that they solved this problem - which was most likely due to the fact that they were new filmmakers).The funniest part is the ""Garbage Dick"" scene - hands down."
1,Woefully Bad,"I read all the negative reviews of this movie before I bought it - I should have believed them! I am a huge fan of Broken Lizard, and thought that would make the difference. It didn't. This movie really is as bad as everyone says it is. I can't think of one joke that I laughed at, or one truly quotable line. It's poorly acted and the plotline is prectically non existant. It doesn't matter how big of a fan you are of Super Troopers and Club Dread, this movie sucks. Save yourself the money and the agony and skip this disaster!"
3,It was decent,"I have read other works by Sandra Kitt and I must say this one was a bit less than I expected but it was still very intersting. The storyline was good and I liked the characters( for the most part). My problem was that alot of the stuff in the book was unrealistic. It reminded me too much of a soap opera, especially with the ending. It needed to be more down to earth. However the whole romance scene wasn't bad."
4,It could be better.,"I felt that the characters were not really realistic, and needed more flavor in the writing. The two characters that were supposed to be best friends acted as if they were complete strangers wanting the same man. But from the beginning of the book you could tell who the man in the middle really wanted."
5,Well done.,"I highly recommend The Essential Evangelical Parallel Bible. It is a simple 4 column (2 on the left page, 2 on the right) Bible that allows you to compare New the King James Version, English Standard Version, New Living Translation, The Message.I use the ESV and have really been enjoying the NLT lately. Bill Mounce suggests using these two to get a fuller understanding of the original meaning of the Biblical authors. The ESV is good for Bible study because of its accuracy and closeness to the original words. The NLT is good because it is accurate, but also in today's language. The New King James is also easy to read and very accurate. I'm not sure of the accuracy of The Message, but look forward to reading some of it. It may be mostly good as a commentary. We'll see.All in all, this Bible is an excellent addition to my library."
4,Great space saver!,"I love to compare bible versions and found that this one is excellent for comparing three nice translations and one rotten paraphrase side-by-side using only one book. It compares the New King James, English Standard Version, New Living Translation, and the Message. The first two are more literal translations are are great for study. The NLT is excellent for devotions, It is a joke to call the Message a paraphrase, let alone a bible. I would rather have the first three bible versions and leave a column blank for notes than have the Message. I think it detracts from what is otherwise a great study aid. With that being said, I believe it is worth it to have the three translations side-by-side for easy comparison without fumbling with three different books. The print is OK for a bible of this size. The hardbook edition I have seems durable enough. The pages are a little thin."
4,Makes it Easy,"Step-by-step video on how to prune roses - and barehanded, no less! James Smith has an easy teaching style, speaks clearly and slowly enough to follow, and has beautiful hands (you're watching them on this DVD, so that's a perk).Being a complete novice, I had to watch the video awhile to get a sense of what an ""outward facing bud"" was - critical to correct pruning! (Who knew?!) Also answered later in the video was when to prune.Seeing the pruning done is easier than reading about it. (And watching the cats walk through the video added comic relief.)The videography itself was the only weakness. The camera was unsteady at times, and zooming in to something happening on the back side of the branch didn't show much more than a stationary shot would have. Still, the shots are clear, and the teaching is excellent. Jim knows his stuff!(I also *very highly* recommend his gardening book.The Wise Old Gnome Speaks: How to Really, Really, Really Care About Your Garden)"
1,Anti-Bride Guide-Not Really Out of the Box Thinking,I was disappointed in the lack of interesting ideas for a different type of wedding. You can read it in a couple of hours and then you won't need to refer to it again. Maybe you'll get an idea or two. I would recommend just checking it out of a library rather than buying it.
1,There's nothing anti about it,"This book is exactly, EXACTLY! the same as every other wedding planning book on the market. Nothing happens outside the box. I was looking for a book that would help me plan a truly non-traditional wedding, and instead the book suggests a few slight variations on all the current traditions. It was a waste of my $20, a waste of the hour I spent reading it, and a waste of space in my box of books to give to Goodwill."
5,excellent mystery,"This is a great first novel. Quite accurate in psychological aspects. A little different as there were few ""twists and turns"" as it was more a ""police procedural"". The characters were well developed and believable and real. I am looking forward to his next. Well look for his website and see what is forthcoming. Long and held my attention. Very well written."
5,Learning about animals and having fun too!,"My daughter is 3 and loves this game. It teaches facts on many types of animals plus, children learn colors, shapes, math, picture matching, memory skill and more.Stanley has to find objects around the house and put them in his bag. After he plays all the games and finds all the stickers he sets out to find Theodore, his inflatable tiger.It's just like an episode from the tv. They'll love it."
5,They really DO exist!,I told my husband about pizza scissors I remembered as a child (in the 60's) He thought I was pulling his leg all these years. He saw these and now he knows I'm not crazy.
5,K&N filters,This is not my first K&N product and there's a reason for that. They build a reliable filter that lasts a long time though I cant prove the million mile claim. I've also turned my friends into K&N customers and they all agree. If you want to save money this filter will do the trick.
1,Lid Organizer,Nice product but it would have been nice if they told you that you have to do away with the foam in the cases' lid to fasten or mount the thing. Because of this I did not use it.
3,holistic healthcare theory,"The content of this book, originally translated in 1949, could be 3,000 years old and reflects a distinctly holistic approach to wellness and disease. The author strives to identify the causes of non-wellness. The author approaches the human organism from the function and linkages of all organs to different parts of the body. It provides a complete endorsement and supportive theory for acupuncture and other forms of holistic treatment that takes into account the individual's environment, the seasons, and many additional internal and external factors. The book is more revealing about China and the Chinese than traditional interpretive treaties and consequently reveals much about Western medicine through the blank space of what is generally not discussed in Western healthcare. Sure, there are translation errors, but it's an excellent source of information about the genesis and basis of Asian healthcare."
5,Awesome Sounds. Cool Looks.,"Fantastic value. $75 delivered to my door. Can't beat it. (Stores in my area sell them at a firm $100.) Sound is remarkable. Don't believe any reviews that say the controls are hard to use. They couldn't be easier. Subwoofer magnetically sealed, so it can sit right on the desk next to monitor."
2,Beginer's aquarium book only!,"Is java fern found in an Australian river, I don't think so. This book is not accurate!All of the aquarium displays are not even mature, probably because most of the plants would be quite unhealthy by the time the display is mature enough to photograph, very unprofessional!Another example: there are no mangroves in the mangrove swamp design, Hygrophila corymbosa was used instead with the author stating it is a good substitute for mangroves, what the, right up until the brackish water kills it! What's almost as worse is that the heater is not even hidden in the aquarium background."
2,Not accurate,"As a biologist, I'm disappointed with the inclusion of non-insects in this book. For example, a roly-poly is not an insect, it is a crustacean. Also, the book counts pro-legs on caterpillars as legs (ALL INSECTS have 6 legs!). What is even more disappointing is that the book promotes itself as scientifically accurate, so parents teach their children the wrong information. These early misconceptions (like that spiders or roly-polies are insects), persists through adulthood."
1,no idea,"I have no idea how this product is. I ordered it on March 6th and as of April 6th, the eVitaminStore has still not sent them to me. They sent the wrong kind at first and I followed their instructions to correct the order, but they have not followed through on their end."
5,Bravo!!!,"This is a wonderful recording. Bach is probably my favorite composer, and The Art of Fugue excites the brain, as one tries to follow each instrument. It is a wonderful experience by a wonderful conductor. The music is passionate, precise, and brilliant."
3,WHOA ...,"That's all I can say about this ""Pet Alien"" DVD: ""WHOA..."" That's because the four episodes in this DVD have titles that end with ""of Doom"", hence the DVD title. Either way, there's more spacey shennanigans with Tommy Cadle and his alien friends.Here's the lowdown of these co-incidental episodes:""Crater of Doom"" is about Tommy getting a hideous pimple on School Picture Day. ""Sounds of Doom"" involves Tommy being forced to take accordion lessons. ""Box of Doom"" has Dinko and company discovering a strange locked-up box in Tommy's basement, and fear what's inside it. In ""Doctor of Doom"", Tommy doesn't want to go to the doctor, which gives Dinko another harebrained idea.If this DVD isn't part of your ""Pet Alien"" collection, you're doomed, too."
3,Definitely geared towards kids,"I should have assumed it was geared towards kids just by looking at the box....but my love of all things dinosaur was just too great. A nice generalized overview of dinos, including exactly what they are, when they lived, how they behaved, what they looked like, how we know the things we know about them, and theories on how they got wiped out. They also go into more detail about the popular dinosaurs and the record holding dinosaurs. Additional fairly recent information such as DNA /cloning, feathered dinos, and bird links make this show up to date. Each person in the program portrays a very distinctive personality (some annoying), and focus on colorful visuals both of which makes it kid-friendly. Overall, I don't regret the purchase at all... If you like dinosaurs you'll probably buy it anyway....BUT if you are a casual browser I would recommend something more substantial such as the Walking With Dinosaurs special or When Dinosaurs Roamed America."
3,Slow and boring but the real thing,"The potential of this movie was enormous ,however it doesnt quite live up to its expectations considering the ""actual counters/authors"" involvedNot a must-have but certainly not a complete waste of money."
4,Rise of the Queen,"Birth of the Chess Queen is a history about chess in medieval Europe - it focuses on the status of queens both on and off the chessboard.It was not until the 15th century that the Chess Queen became the most powerful piece on the board. We are told this change was part of a broader social history of chess and of women players. Queens and rulers in Spain, Italy, Germany, France England, Scandinavia, and Russia were playing the game - women such as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Margaret of Denmark, Isabella of Castile, and Catherine the Great, among many others.Chess Queens can also be linked to the cult of the Virgin Mary. And chess had links with the cult of love and was a symbol of romance, because chess-playing was one of the few ways in which noble women could interact with men.The book is rich with illustrations and is a pleasure to read for chess players and equally for non chess players."
5,"Insightful, must-read about Executive Coaching",If you are a line executive or an HR leader - you will find this book useful. It takes you through the process of selecting the right coach and then allows you the opportunity to hear from the best. This is the best coaching book on the market currently.
2,Not that great!! No real advice....,"I was a bit let down when I received the book. It's more aricles and stories of women's horror stories (and some are very bad!) than how to handle situations. I was looking for some great advice, but this book is more for laughs than helping."
5,"""It's Important for those who are awake to be awake.""","I know I am not alone in my utter dismissal of the one negative review of this book. Indeed, I hesitate to give it prominence by mentioning it. Sometimes it is important, however, to call things by their proper name. In this case, the negative review is utter, benighted nonsense. As William Stafford said, ""It is important for those who are awake to be awake."""
3,Trailer instrumental not included!,"I was extremely dissappointed that the music from the trailer was NOT on the soundtrack.My friend bought the cd and I went through every track looking for the Instrumental version of Cells by the servant.If your looking for the music from the trailer, don't buy it. But the music that is there really works when your in the mood for it.Not everyday music, but great music anyway.I bought it anyway."
3,Don't buy unless you've heard the soundtrack!!,"I love soundtracks and own about 100 of them. This is not one I would have normally gotten except that Graeme Revell was on it.If you haven't seen the movie and don't really(and I mean really) dig discordant jazz/noir type music then this won't be your kind of soundtrack.However, it fits the movie and Frank Miller's comic perfectly. Try reading Sin City while listening, very atmospheric. But overall, it's neither easy nor even enjoyable listening."
5,A must read!,"""The Family of Adoption"" should be read by everyone involved with adoption. The book is easy to read - Dr. Pavao is an expert who is passionate about children and therefore does not fill her book with needless technical/academic jargon. This is definately a must read!"
1,thermopile,HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE TO REVIEW AN ITEM THAT I HAVE NOT RESEIVED YET AND IS WELL OVER DO
3,Great tent if not for condensation problem,"I have used this tent over for 4 years now. I love its lightweight and easy-of-use. It takes minutes to set up and put away. But condensation is an issue, especially if it in cold and wet conditions. The first place I had problem with it was in Tahoe Rim in late September at an altitude of 11,000 ft. It snowed and the temperature went below freezing. The condensation froze and it felt like snowing inside too. The second place I had problem was on the Devil's Loop in the Northern Cascade in late August at an altitude of 7,000 ft. Rain started after I called it a night and it poured the whole night. I found the tent did a good job of keeping water out but also did a good job of keeping water in. Condensation was so bad that my head was dripped on constantly."
2,"Good Lyrics, Poor Vocals","Pedro Abrunhosa is one of the best song-writers in Portugal, and this CD proves it; however, his voice is rather weak: he cannot quite sing, what he does is to speak very low and without any musicality: it can upset people who like to hear good musical performances. Good lyrics, great music, but a very poor singer....."
5,bought as a christmas present,this was a great find i love steven king it was nice to find all good movies in one bungle the price was great too a must buy
5,Five Minus,"Because of Hancock's ability as a storyteller, I'd like to give A Shadow Within a straight 5-star review. Besides relating a tale filled with intrigue and suspense, she continues to develop an interesting fantasy world. Without a doubt her characters are three-dimensional. The Christian theme is clear, yet anything but preachy. I continue to recommend this book as one of the best examples of Christian fiction and certainly of Christian fantasy.So, why the minus? Why can't I give that straight 5-stars? I feel that there is something missing in the main character that makes him less than engaging. I want to be on the edge of my seating waiting for the next book because he was so captivating in this one, but that is not the case. While I will eagerly read the next in the Guardian-King series, I don't feel compelled. It's such a fine line and certainly nothing that should deter anyone from reading and enjoying otherwise excellent writing."
1,Worthless junk. Buy anything else.,Handle broke within 2 minutes of first light usage.Company sent a replacement. That broke right away too.The motor burnt out and died after third usage.When will companies stop manufacturing such barely functioning junk?My dad's trimmer lasted 40 years!I'll never buy anything from this company again.
5,"This and the movie ""The Truman Show""...","...have something in common. The anthem from ""The Truman Show"" was written by Phillip Glass also.Itaipu is a terrific, powerful, soaring piece that will power you with its undercurrents and it's pounding off-meter beats. The chorus glides around, under and through Glass' minimalist scoring. All elements combine to create a wonderful listening experience. It's a true joy!"
1,defective toy - terrible customer service,"This was a nice idea, but is poorly made and over priced. Don't think it will be easy to return either. You must deal directly with Interactive Toys, who are the most unprofessional bunch i have ever encountered, not to mention rude and condescending. Your money is better spent on something else."
3,Good camera but outdoor shots come out of focus,I have taken more than 500 pictures with tihs camera. Indoor pictures come out great but 90% of the outdoor pictures with people in it come out fuzzy in auto mode. Has anyone else seen this problem?
4,Great Camera,"I have had this more than 5 years now, of course used it extensively and have really had no issues so far.Its great that the LCD is protected."
5,A wonderful camera,"Right out of the box (after I charged the battery) the camera takes great pictures. Start by using the auto mode and then you can gradually experiment with the varied settings. Don't worry, you won't waste ""film""! After taking my first photos, I connected the camera to my iBook and it automatically popped up on my desktop and transfered the photos to iPhoto. It's not inexpensive but worth the $ because it won't be outmoded next year like some of the low rez cameras."
4,"No Date Stamp (Imprint), be careful","Good camara, however, be careful, it can not put a date stamp (imprint)on your digial *.JPG file. and I have talked to Canon help line and there is no plan to support it."
1,Rehash of old information,"I have worked with PB since its inception about 12 years ago. During that time I have purchased everything written about it. This is the worst effort put into print. It is simply a rehash of articles on xml, soap, and internet theory. There is no relationship between PB 9 and this text other than the mention of it by the authors. Save yourself some money and wait or something that actually shows you how to develop internet and distributed applications -- this one does not!!!"
1,"Blah, blah, blah","Save your money. This book, and its companion, are both written in editorial style, each chapter by a (potentially) different author who each feel that they must fill in the space with more history than substance.Get the online documentation from Sybase for free and learn something without wasting your time. That is unless you like history."
3,rewrite of Kathleen Morgan's Hearts Lair,"I liked reading this book, but it's basically the same book as Hearts Lair by Kathleen Morgan. Everything is similar including the cat-man green/gold eyed hero. Ms. Joy's book was more erotic but pretty much the same otherwise. The events in the first chapter with the hero being chained naked to a wall, drugged, and having the heroine find him thus are exactly the same between the two books. I liked the book mostly because it was a continuation of The Matrix of Destiny books, but it was very unoriginal, and I felt cheated after I read both Hearts Lair and Mine to Take back to back. I felt that Ms. Joy could have done better. I suggest that if you want the original story you read Hearts Lair by Kathleen Morgan and just enjoy Mine to Take as a continuation of a much better story line in the MOD series."
5,Fantastic,"The first time I 've read Dara Joy's book is A knight of Trillion Stars. I souldn't take away my eyes from that book until I was finish. From that moment until now I always waited for a new book from Dara Joy. And then I found Mine to take which caught my eyes and my mind. It's fantastic story. A lesson of the power of woman's heart. And Gian Ren.....I wish there're still men like him and Lorgin ( I admired about Lorgin's Love, patience and braveness) in this world. And how about Traed? He's still a mystery for me. I can't wait the story about Traed."
5,Mine to take,"Hi, my name is Nikki. I came across this book ""Mine to Take"" by accident when I was in a bookstore in Melbourne, Australia I loved it and after I finished, I went on the internet and ordered the other 2 books (Rejar, Knight of a Trillion Stars), one thing I'm wanting to know is what happened to the young familiar ""Dariq "" who was taken and then beaten and save by the old woman. What happens? Is there going to be a book on Traed ? I'm sure the other fans are wanting to know also. Dara, keep writing I love your work."
2,Dissapointing.,"I found the book not very well written, though I applaud Dara Joy's talent in creating her own fantasy world. The characters seemed extremely underdeveloped and the sex ""scenes"" seemed tacked on for effect."
3,Warning CD-R format,This Diatonis DTS CD Audio is on the CD-R format. To play it yourDVD or CD player must support CD-R (SOME Players don't)You have been warned.
1,Ex post facto assertions,"It is an agitprop masterwork involved presenting the communist wolves as innocent victims of a heartless state; repackaging Jack the ripper as a feminist would have been, by comparison a child's play.Reading the book savored all too obviously of the proverbial chutzpah-exemplar who murdered his parents and then pleaded for mercy as an orphan."
5,review,I love all these movies because they have great actingI would recommend these movies for people of 13 yrs old and older
3,The Line,After Bonnie Raitts cover of Right Down the Line I bought this to remind me of the original. Really superb & sweet guitar break. Rest of the album is OK. At it's time Stuck in the Middle & Baker st were tops.....yet overplayed to the point of annoyance.
5,Zig is great,"A truly great way to get motivated, and get going! Get a ""check up from the neck up"". Mr Ziglar is a great goal setter."
1,Wish it worked,"We went through the 10 minute remote control programming process twice. Just couldn't get it to work. One really disappointed little girl is left to push the princesses around on the board. The grandmother who gave us the game really wishes she had chosen a dress-up trunk, or something else."
2,Bridge Set was 2005 Edition and Colors not true,"As a graphic designer, I've been using the Pantone PMS Matching system for over 15 years, and was excited to get the Pantone Color Bridge set. However, it was a 2005 edition, and the colors were no longer all ""true,"" especially the CMYK mixes. I had a print job almost ruined because I used the CMYK mix on the bridge set. Upon seeing a printed proof of my job, I double-checked the ink setup on another CMYK chart, and realized the Bridge color was very wrong. I returned the set the next day, as this could have been a very costly mistake. On a positive note, Amazon made the return very easy."
3,"In light of the last Sunn0))) album, disappointing...","As minimal as the last Sunn0))) disc was, it spent a ton of time in my CD player for at least several months. The album's production was absolutely top-notch for this brand of music, especially in comparison to Earth's seminal Earth 2 album and earlier Sunn0))) outtings like 00 Void and The Grim Robe Demos.White 1 strays a bit from the typical Sunn0))) approach, which is totally respectable in light of how limited a style of music power drone can tend to be, but simply isn't as powerful as Flight of the Behemoth. The production is a bit flat, particularly on the opening track, which features a questionable spoken word track above the gloom and doom.I can't say any of the tracks really grab me as did the tracks on Flight of the Behemoth, though I did enjoy the minimalist silence of A Shaving of the Horn That Speared You. Still, it is a respectable outting that takes a different approach to an old style."
5,Old-fashioned? You must be joking!,"For me and many other people, there's only one reaction to Francescatti's violin playing: DEEP EMOTION! And ""his"" Beethoven sonatas are particularly intense, lyrical and expressive. Extremely lyrical and expressive, but with no languor or sluggishness. Listen to the Primavera's second movement and you'll see what I mean! His way of playing is a concentrate of emotion. Some people find his way of playing academic: if so, long live Academia. And his unity of intent with Casedesus is nothing short of amazing. In so many instances, either the violin is much better than the piano or, more often, the pianist is a giant and the other guy a dwarf: the balance here is magnificent. Believe me: if you don't know it, listen to it and buy it!"
4,Sweet Singing Steel,"A great album featuring some of the best steel guitar songs from the past. Good sound and a good collection of some slow and some fast selections. If you're a steel guitar fan, this IS your album.."
5,best mix of classical music EVER,"If I was stranded on a desert island with only 1 CD, this would be it! The best mix of classical music I've ever found (my first copy was a cassette in 1994). If I could give it 10 Stars, I would! Bright, cheerful, turn-your-day-around music! And having a candlelight brunch (can you picture that!) with this playing in the background truly is delightful. HIGHLY recommended!"
3,Too understated,"I also own the Tallis Scholar's recording of the Missa and I enjoy it very much. The Huelgas recording of it is too understated, too bland, little momentum as if van Nevel was content with being emotionally uninvolved. I tried on several different occassions to try to like this CD but I couldn't. Maybe I'll try again in a few years."
4,great novel; distracting edition,"This is a terrific novel, even if bleak, as some of the reviewers claim. And really, the bleakness is leavened by a wicked sense of humor. My only complaint is about this particular edition, the Oxford World's Classic. In their attempt at erudition the editors insert irritating asterisks all too frequently in the text, in order to draw our attention to explanatory notes at the back. The notes are in most cases unnecessary, explaining things most readers would already know, and seem provided more in a desire to justify an annotated edition than out of actual need. In any case, they could have a volume with notes included by page at the back of the book, without placing an asterisk in every paragraph that gets discussed--if we have a question on a particular page we could look to the back and see if there is any explanation for that page. So, this a great book, but I'd get a different edition."
1,suga t leave jesus and go back to drugs and hustling,"suga t was a cool decent rapper back in the click but then when the money goes low and radio does'nt give you airplay you know radio and television just act like the west coast does'nt exist these days it's easy for suga to quit the life and go gospel this is awful though kirk franklin started this by taking christian rap mainstream now everybody wanna follow suit she think going gospel whatever will get her a bigger audience a sad joke and tells you the state of west xoast hip hop who's gonna go god next boss, yoyo, deadly venomz, jj fad, marveless."
4,Pretty but Incomplete,"This is about the only guide to the snake fauna of the island of Borneo. It has lots of pretty photos of the most attractive/distinctive species, good general chapters as introduction, a useful checklist of all species known from the island, and details on every genus.It also has a key, however that is only really useful down to genus level, as it doesn't cover all species, especially smaller ones like Calamaria.Thus, while it helps you identify the more common or striking species, it will leave you helpless with many others.Still, being the only guide available to Bornean snakes, it is worth having.If you can't find it online don't despair - it is available in bookshops in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysian Borneo."
5,A Nguyen,Very good product! Work great and superb fast! Easy intall hardware and software and great price. Highly recommended.
1,what is this editorial review? which ode to jewish freedom?,"I am sorry to admit that i cannot make any sense of the editorial review.Is it a history of judaism? NoDoes it contain any relevant information to the blu ray disc or its musical content? NoIs there an ode to jewish freedom by Ludwig von Beethoven? NoThe only hits you get on search engines for this are the amazon links for this disc.Oh wait, it is a new trick by Alexander Jero, the recording artist whom you can admire in a sleeveless shirt on the disc cover, so he can attack any bad reviewer by making him into an antisemit.Pls take the time to read through the comments of the 1 star reviews and find out for yourselves."
1,WowPad,"This item, though ordered, failed to turn up with the other 2 items.There was no explanation as to why this was missing."
2,"too broad, not enough detail","In my opinion, this book could have whittled down the number of entries, and told us more about each subject. And more importantly, shown us more than one photo of each entry.I mean, can one photo of Linda E. suffice?"
4,It's a iffy chance,This looks aewsome and it was when I got it.. but the material is so fragile that while I first got it running it leaked at the bottom!!! I was made but luckly I got my refund for it. But if I can get one without a messed up bottom I'd totally buy another one
4,He's on your side!,It was good to catch up with Edward Woodward after so many years...I saw this years ago...and enjoyed it then...but it was back in '85...we would do it all differently now..and shoot the bad guys...he tries to find alternative ways out...probably a bit too stilted by today's standards but a nice try anyhow.
4,NICE ALBUM,I REALLY ENJOY LISTENING TO AKON HIS VOICE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ARTIST WHICH MAKES HIM STAND OUT. THE GUY HAS TALENT THE ALBUM IS REALLY GOOD. IT MIGHT NOT BE A 10 BUT I WOULD PURCHASE IT HE GOT JOINTS THAT WILL MAKE YOU MOVE AND ALSO THINK!
2,HATED IT,"AFTER THE 1ST PLAY, I NEVER LISTENED TO THIS CD AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ALRIGHT, BUT HIS VOICE IS JUST TOO FREAKING ANNOYING TO ME. THE ONLY SONG I LIKE IS I WANNA F**K U, THAT'S IT, MAYBE ANOTHER SONG, DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS, HIS VOICE JUST KINDA TUNED ME OUT AND THE BEATS ARE TERRIBLE, NOTHING REALLY CATCHY. AFTER I LISTENED, ALL I THOUGHT OF WAS WHO I COULD GIVE IT TO, BUT NOBODY WANTED IT. BUT IF U ENJOY NOSTRIL SINGING, COP IT!, HELL I'LL GIVE IT TO YA FOR FREE"
5,best disco tracks ever,I dance in New York on a regular basis and nothing gets my groove on like this track. I think that cloud one's atmosphere strut epitomizes all that is best about disco.
3,The Gold Cadillac,"""The Gold Cadillac"" was really good, but really sad. An African-American family buys a gold cadillac and goes to the city. Some 'white' cops stop them. Because they are black, the cops think the dad stole the car. It was unfair. It's fiction, but a lot of times there were real situtations like that."
2,boring,"I didn't like the book becase the book was just boring, and the story had no point what-so-ever. It's a book that peopple who like reading old books would read!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for more of a behind the scenes look at the race world since his Dad covered the big Secretariat match... but it is more of a memoir, and has very little to do with the race scene... at least in the first 50 pages... I couldn't stick with it due to it not capturing my interest."
3,hit and miss,"I'm one of those people who think Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga is Spoon's best CD. while these two recordings have some good songs, many are only interesting for about 20 seconds. I think Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga is the perfect blend of Telefono's rawness and the more polished Kill The Moonlight phase. Still, Cvantez, Idiot Driver and Plastic Mylar are some of the more memorable tracks here."
2,Sunsets Stinks,"I am a definate repeat offender in the FISHtank...But I cannot get into this one at all! Sorry Onkle Fish. The Beautiful melodies are almost gone...left is a stacatto experimentation of drum beats that don't necessarilly fit the mood. There are some good songs however...""Goldfish and Clowns"", ""Tara"", and ""Change of Heart"" This is not Vigil...nor would I hope it to be...but this isn't at all what I thought it would be. Steven Wilson (The guy from Porcupine Tree that wrote most of the music) should stick to his own band and leave FISH alone. FISHheads will find validity in this dics...but it won't gain him any new fans, unfortunately."
5,I keep coming back,"I have heard many recordings of the B minor Sonata, and there is no shortage of wonderful readings. Lipatti's is die-and-go-to-heaven beautiful. Kapell's is a delight, displaying some of the most effortless technique ever to be recorded on a piano. Pogorelich's is fiery, confident and proud. Brailowsky doesn't match the more powerful younger generation, but his touch is from a bygone era, and the feeling he brings to this music bears a stamp of authenticity that is unmistakable. And he does it with no frippery, no funny ""rubato,"" no willful interpretation. Even the Largo, which is for so many pianists an opportunity to bend phrases to the breaking point, is played about as straight as it possibly could be and with very little pedal. He is aristocratic, but never aloof or detached. Why, he seems to ask, would anyone try to improve upon perfection?"
1,Not great :0(,"I've had some Oolong that was wonderful and rich with jasmine flavor. Sadly, this isn't one of them. Next time I'll purchase it at a tea shop or specialty store. You need to use 2 bags for a mug to get any flavor at all. Very disapointed."
5,Just what I wanted!,"This book was in great condition and was described well. So when it arrived I received exactly what I expected. The book was in very good shape, although not ""crackling"" new it was like a book my mother might've read and gently passed to me. Perfect for my purposes."
2,pedantic,"Elaine Kalisher is about the only thing that dredges this movie up from a 1 star as you're really pulling/hoping for her. Aside from that, it inclines towards the dull and predictable throughout although ""the 13th floor"" was set so as to ""grab"" any horror officionados to keep them from switching it off."
4,A movie worth seeing!,"Nightmare on the 13th Floor is a great horror movie. It's not like the best in the world, but it's just one of those movies to watch if you can't sleep or something. Overall, this is a very worth-to-see movie."
5,Hauntingly beautiful music!,"This is a highly unusual recording of some old hymns by agifted artist who is a master of sound and its healing effects on us.Tom Kenyon has a four octave range voice, and it gives his music a power and a spiritual force rarely experienced.He gives a depth to the hymns that I have never heard before.It is an elevating experience to let his voice transport you to a higher awareness and to a place of wholeness and healing."
3,"Right Book, Wrong cover.","Don't get me wrong the book is great read, however I have all of the newest versions of the Drizzt series and I received an old one. Yes the book is the same as far as I can tell, but it would of been nice to know that I was getting the older version of Passage to Dawn even though it was advertised as the newest version. That my friends, was quite the let down."
2,Not nearly what I expected,"I am an avid fan of everything that has to do with Drizzt Do'Urden, and I was looking forward to this one more than you can know. However, I was rather disappointed when it actually came out. Starless Night was my favorite, and the books had, in general, been getting better each time. However, this Passage to Dawn does not continue this trend. The characters seem to have less depth, and the plot certainly does. It is predictable and rather destructive to the masterful stories Salvatore has told in the past. He always had two strong points: interesting, well-developed characters, and cool fight scenes. Unfortunately, neither of these shows up very well in this book. The great characters, other than Drizzt, are gone (Jarlaxle and Entreri) or poorly portrayed (Cattie-Brie, Regis). Even Drizzt doesn't seem to ""think"" as much as he used to. I think Salvatore got tired of writing the series, and he should have stopped at the last book."
4,What's so wrong with perfect?,"Sure, some of the things in Passage to Dawn could have been better, but writing is an art, a creative process, and with most things like that there are always ways to improve. And what is so wrong with Drizzt being nearly perfect? So what if it isn't totally ""realistic"". That word is subjective. This is fantasy, it obviously ISN'T realistic. I for one would be sorely disappointed if Drizzt strayed from his path. He has faced so many trials and so much pain to get where he is, he deserves to continue down the right path. If his ""perfection"" grates so one some people's nerves, is it because they are perhaps a bit jealous? I will continue to look forward to the books about this ""deserving drow."""
4,Another 100 pages......,"IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON READING ""THE CLERIC QUINTET"" ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK OR THIS REVIEWWell, i'm not all the way done with it. BUT i wanted to warn ppl to not read it if you want to read the cleric quintet(it'll give the ending away). So far, I've loved this book! Stumpet finding the Crystal Shard was a big surprise to me. The only reason it's not getting 5 *'s, is because it had Cadderly....Since I've read the Cleric Quintet, i've hated him. I don't care if it was a test from Denier, he shouldn't have risked it! Grr...Sorry, but he really irritates me, because i can't forget what he did to Danica. Even if he is getting younger, he didn't know that. I hope he doesn't appear in any more books. Danica,Ivan, and Pikel are a diff. story! Pikel is by far my fav. character! I don't think this book is predictable, like many do. Also, i found the two wizards, that's right, 2 major magic users in the book!, refresing."
4,A good book but not Salvatores greatest work!,Passage to Dawn is a fantastic book but like most people am dissapointed with the end. Wulfgar is a great character but I do not think he should have been brought back having died in such a great way(if dying can be called great!). I loved the humour with Harkle being brought into the story for a short time. The book is still a good one and I recommend all drizzt fans to read it.
3,Not the best of quality...,Received the stand today and while putting it together realized it really didn't fit together to good. The legs are suppose to fit snug into the corner but there is a noticable space between the leg and stand on all 4 corners. I wish I would have gone with a different one...
5,fascinating and revelaing,"Ms. Jenkins lucid account of affirmative action policies in India and the US is revealing in it's depth of understanding, objective view combined with empathy for the subject, and insight that could be obtained solely at the source. The readability quotient is very high. Five stars plus, a must read for all studying affirmative action, and all with a desire for a finely honed insight."
5,A no-regret new family favorite classic!!,"Although we didn't get this book on Amazon, we did get it and we LOVE it! The baked four cheese Pasta recipe has become a Holiday tradition after only 2 years and whenever we make it as a carry-along dish we get the stunned reviews and the ""please can we have that recipe"" feedback that you'd expect! It is truly decadent and sublime and honestly one of the best Mac and Cheese recipes I can imagine having! I can say that that one recipe alone is worth the whole book but the others are all amazing too that we've tried and are just icing on the cake!You will not regret getting this book!"
5,BEST SERIES EVER,I am completely in love w/Raising Hope. ALL of the cast members work well off of each other. I can't wait for more episodes to be released. TOTAL FAN here!!! :) Funniest show that I have ever seen that makes me LOL all alone in a room by myself!! MORE EPISODES PLEASE!!!!
1,Bring Back Earl,"I love My Name is Earl, but I can't stand this show. Earl was heartfelt. This show is too contrived, like a white trash version of ""Malcolm in the Middle"", another show which I cannot stand."
4,Simple Solutions are the Best,"What I liked best about Maynard Rolston's approach is the simple and straightforward methods he advocates. Rather than long and lengthly chapters about why we need to get better organized, he cuts right to the chase. I was able to start implementing these techniques in less than 24 hours! Many of the other programs in other books I considered would have taken me weeks to implement. Within the first week of using this program, I started going home two hours earlier than usual. I even got to eat dinner with my family again. Now I need to get my secretary her own copy."
1,Misleading ad,I was expecting 2 of these 7 1/4 inch corelle plates. The ad is very misleading.Over $10 for 1 very small plate is outlandish!!! Would give it zero stars if I could.
5,Talking Turkey,"When my book club offered ""Illumination in the Flatwoods"" I was flabergasted! Who wants to read about turkeys? Well YOU! Its a captivating story about a gentleman (turned turkey) who saves wild turkey eggs to incubate and raise as the US government, in their infinite wisdon, decides to make the perfect turkey habitat (of course they screw it up!). It's fascinating, I never thought I would write those words! Their adventures make a truly wonderful story, you'll be amazed by the intelligence of these wild birds. It's a hard to find book unless you go to Amazon, I got it second hand, in perfect condition and passed it on to my wild animal loving son in law."
3,NOT HER BEST,"Of the seven Sandra Kitt books that I've read, FAMILY AFFAIRS is the only one that I did not like. I don't think this novel is up to her usual writing style and story line standard.This is the story of Gayla, a beautiful, single, Black art gallery manager in New York. She is the mother of Allison, who is very obviously half-white. An old acquaintance comes on the scene with ""new-age"" art and a relationship develops. Meanwhile Allison's father reappears and finds out he has a teenage daughter.I've read and reveiwed many of Ms. Kitt's books and novellas, with very favorable ratings. This one didn't measure up."
2,Color of Love still her best..,"Since reading COLOR OF LOVE (which I feel is her best book) I had been reading all her subsequent books..hoping that the books will be as good as Color of Love...however they are all not up to the expectation. I think I'm going to skip her next book, Homecoming, as I don't want to be dissapointed again.."
3,This one was disappointing,"I have always enjoyed Sandra Kitt's books, COLOR OF LOVE, INSIGNIFICANT OTHERS, her books on the Arabesque line etc.. I have to ask, What happened with this book?. It was slow moving, there was no depth and little was left to the imagination. This was not a typical Sandra Kitt book. I can only hope that the next one will be better."
5,This book deserves a good review!,"I just went down the list of all the reviews and am shocked to find all these horrible reviews. The story is great! Granted the sex dosen't do much for the main plot, but as a whole it is a good story.I find this quite puzzleing as to why there are so many bad reviews of this book. The series sold better than all the other Trek book series. (If it sold so well, why so many reviews.)Bottom line, a fabulous book! (You gotta admit, these Redeemers present an intreging story line. Since when did Picard, Kirk, Janeway, or Sisko ever face a race who's religion is their modivation for their destruction.)"
2,Get Cervone's book,"The author used this book in addition to his notes to teach his Unix Performance course at the UCalif at Santa Cruz Extention(which is next to San Jose Airport). Maybe the two day course was too short, but there were not enough coverage to be useful. While there are detailed account for raw performance comparisons between different hardware platforms, and hardware resource usage topics, there are no sections on performance tuning which is what you want out of this course. Yeah may be that topic is in the referenced books. Afterwards I went back to get the Cervone book(old but good) and discovered what I was missing. So know what you need before you buy. I didn't have a choice."
4,Helpful information on St. John's wort & depression,"While trying to decide whether and how to use St. John's wort, I read three books on it and flipped through some others, and I liked this book the best. I appreciated that, although Dr. Cass seems to lean toward ""alternative"" treatments for depression--including St. John's wort and large doses of vitamins and minerals--she is not ideologically opposed to ""conventional"" antidepressants, which she also uses in her clinical practice, and so she is able to offer some helpful comments on the relative merits and appropriate roles of St. John's wort and synthetic antidepressants. The book includes chapters on what depression is, what St. John's wort is, how to use St. John's wort, the evidence for its efficacy, synthetic antidepressants, nutrition, and other elements of a ""depression-free lifestyle.""(Two other recommendations on depression: Richard O'Connor's ""Undoing Depression"" and John and Andrea Nelson's ""Sacred Sorrows."")"
5,Top Notch Scanner,I find this scanner to be as good or better than advertised. It produces excellent results when scanning color and black and white photos as well as slides and color 35mm negatives.
3,Not quite up to par...,"I purchased this scanner to replace my Acer 610P 600x600 48-bit scanner. I have compared images for a week and I cannot get an image as good as the Acer produces, therefore I will be trading the scanner in for something different. I really didn't expect the scanner to be below the quality of my 4 year old scanner. Images appeared to have serious focus problems, tried all sorts of color management with no help on color issues. Spend a little more money for something better. Also, the external scanning is only 24-bit, and not true 48-bit as advertised. Only after reading some PDF files did I find this."
1,Just heat the water. Skip the bags.,"It's a box. The box looks nice, but it's not worth the purchase price. Don't do it. Because the tea, you probably won't use. It's really, really weak-flavored. I oversteeped a pot, used three teabags instead of my usual two, and still could barely taste (even using my imagination a bit to boost it) the ""blueberry.""After trying three types of tea (Blueberry, Mango and one other flavor I couldn't taste and can't recall,) I just dumped the last pot, threw the bags away, and gave the box to my son, who looked at it kinda funny, and muttered something about warhammer figures or something.Sigh."
3,"Of two, one broke within a week","The bulbs look very nice and hand dipped as to the half chrome, however, of the two I ordered, one broke within one week. The other one works well and looks great. Hopefully others will have better luck, but I would not put these up to the quality of other similar bulbs I have ordered from specialty bulb companies."
5,Patchwork of Peace...A wonderful book for needlepoint stitches!,I purchased this book to needlepoint the American Flag with most of the stitches that are included. It also supplies you with stitches that can be placed anywhere on a hand painted canvas. A must have for all stitchers!!!
2,"Hand that rocks the cradle, but bad.","This movie was bad and the acting was worse and the script writer should be punished.All through the movie the director is trying to make it look like the mother has a valid reason for hating the nanny, but she doesn't. She just thinks the kid likes the nanny better, and the kid does.This movie is a cross between ""The Guardian"" and ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle,"" both superior movies in the horror/suspense catorgory.The scariest thing in this so called horror movie is a picture of the devil embracing a woman. That's it. There aren't even spooky sounds in the night.However, I gave it two stars because it was soooooooooo funny."
4,GREAT BOOK,"""Casino Gambling"", a great book that can be used by anyone who enjoys casino gambling. I am a Blackjack player. I have been for years. I purchased ""Casino Gambling"", for the Blackjack. After reading the Blackjack section, I browsed through other sections. I was particularly intrested in Roulette. Reading about ""sectional betting"", I was intrigued. I purchased a Roulette layout, wheel and practiced at home. I used the ""sectional betting"" spelled out in ""Casino Gambling"". It worked. I have played Roulette several times while in the casino and won. The price of the book and layout has more then been paid for by my winnings. Now I have another game to play in the casino. It is easy, a no brainier, that's why I like Roulette. Oh yes. The Blackjack section is informative. I like the approach of looking for the tables that have the likely hood of winning. This makes sense. Great book buy it, read it. Use it like a reference book. My book has yellow stickers from cover to cover."
5,Nostalgia,"What motivated me was a recall of memorables Christmases past. Of note was 1974 when at 14 , my aunts and uncles were playing Al Green' Love and Happiness. This brought back all those wondedrful memoris."
4,Terrific book,"Encouraging words on difficult emotions from a legendary minister, as sifted through the experiences of a contemporary Christian counselor! Skoglund makes Spurgeon accessible to the layperson, and brings his writings on painful emotions together in an organized format. Spurgeon's wisdom mixed with Skoglund's personal anecdotes create a great read for anyone experiencing depression, anxiety, or a ""dark eclipse of the soul"" and wondering if they are alone..."
5,Simply amazing,"I can hardly recall a movie as complex yet easy to follow as this one. I like the message a lot, and I do can feel the pain from the main character. I would say my favorite character is the grand mother. Is a perfect representation of freedom and happyness among tough times and repression."
3,Too much,"with his popularity at it's peak, they decided to give him a tv series. THAT was a mistake, it is very difficult to write for these characters and keep it fresh. Some of this dvd set is funny, but that's it, just some of it."
1,Dead Terrorist sounded intriguing,"I'm pretty flexible when it comes to humor, and even if it's ethnic or politically incorrect, I understand it's a joke ... but after watching for a few minutes I shut this off. My children's ultimate insult is 'You just don't get it' and this is exactly the problem I have with Jeff Dunham's humor - I don't get it. I don't find it funny, just universally insulting. If there's a race or ethnic group he fails to degrade and not in a funny way.Best of luck - there's an audience for everything but it won't include me."
1,Stick to the Live Shows Rather Than TV,"Your Live Stage shows are much funnier than having a TV show. The formula isn't there when you do a TV show compare to what you do on stage. So it's better that you stick what really works.Sorry Jeff, we love you!"
3,"is this low budget TV, or what ?","After watching this, I can see why it did not catch on and did not get renewed.The stand-up DVD's are great, the tv show... not so great, its OK, but..."
2,Jeff Dunham Show--Not Up To His Standards,"What a mistake. Obviously, the TV show didn't get past the initial season. The segments in the show just don't work. Not even comparable to his on-stage shows. They try to incorporate the characters into real-life situations, but not very well. The interaction seems rushed and stilted.It was a disappointment."
3,Just Okay.,"My family and I are big Jeff Dunham fans, but we thought this dvd of his tv show was only mediocre. Fun to watch once, but not like his other dvds that are fun to watch over and over."
3,my opinion,"to me this one isn""t as funny as the others.i have it has lost many key element that made the showwhat it is and once was"
3,Avoid humid areas?,"I purchased this shower/CD player for my recently graduated daughter's first apartment as a fun item. Before purchasing another one for my teenage son, I asked her about this Target shower/CD player. I had just read a recent Amazon review which lacerated of a similar model. Her email respsonse:"" Also, the cd player works great--however, I don't put it in the shower itself because ironically enough you're not supposed to place it humid/moist areas--so not sure why it's a shower device. I do hang it on the doorknob inside the bathroom and listen to tunes in the morning--so i'd give it one and a half thumbs up. """
3,Hot dogging it,"If ever there was a cross between a party movie, a skiiing movie andRocky, this is it. A skier who has been sacrificing his whole life finally gets his shot to knock off a world champion.Of course, the main reason most people will buy this DVD is due to the bikini clad babe on the box cover (myself included!). In that respect, the movie doesn't disappoint. It has PLAYBOY Playmate of the Year Shannon Tweed as a rocky mountain high seductress. She sheds her clothes and the ski slopes are all the better for it!The only problem is that the main girl in the film (played by Tracy N. Smith) is even hotter(!) than Tweed! Sadly, we only get a few tantalzing angles of her in the buff. Had it shown as much of her as Shannon Tweed, this movie would have easily been 4.5 stars in my book! Alas, we don't always get what we want in life."
4,Hot Dog with everything on it,"A fun 80's movie. Definitely not for kids!! (It really earns its R-rating). Give them Benedryl, pop some popcorn, grab some adult beverages, and invite your ski buddies. It has classic hair, clothes, music, bad jokes, a poor plot, aerial stunts that are considered basic today, and of course, the ""adult scenes."" If you skied some the big resorts during this time and partied like a college kid, you'll love the flashback. For a double feature, watch Hot Tub Time Machine! Think snow!!"
2,Dumb but watchable,"A dumb movie somewhat redeemed by some nice skiing sequences but noteworthy largely due to the beautiful Shannon Tweed, whose hot presence spices up the bedroom and hot tub [adult] scenes. Cowabunga to that! The rest of the movie you can pretty much fast forward through."
4,Inner City Mother Goose in Education,"While the language of Eve Merriam's Inner City Mother Goose seems shocking at first glace, it is a very accurate depiction of the happenings in the inner city. As a future educator, I firmly believe that the words in this book can be used to reach these less fortunate children far better than the book's counterpart. Not only did Merriam's book create contoversy, but it created a bridge for those who live in that world to those who have not experienced it. The language is depictive of the society, and Diaz's illustrations and use of color illuminate the child's eye view of their world. This book is a required reading for any person who deals with children from this background in order to not only gain a better understanding of the child, but of your own world."
3,Disappointed,"I bought and read this book when it came out and I must say I was very disappointed - not with the ""Notes from the Road"" portion of the content but that 33% of it was lyrics from his songs. As a fan of Paul's from the late 90's I've had no problem finding the lyrics to his songs on the Web or newsgroups. I found myself desiring a lot more of the journal-entries/notes from the road."
2,THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN IDIOTS!!!,"This low-budget horror film (it's not horrrifying at all!) is about a film crew that's filming in a haunted house, slowy but surely all hell breaks loose as the crew and actors get killed by zombies. Your typical late-night slasher-flick, but worth a look for the unintended hilarity."
3,Didn't reach on time,"My wife badly wanted this, and there was no 1 day or 2 day shipping. This is a medical product and there is no point of getting this in a week after the order."
2,No-Mor Flats- NOT for 26 x1.95,"This might work for smaller sizes but the 26"" one states it is for the 1.75 - 1.95.I have a 26 X 1.95 and it didn't fit right. It is suppose to appear too large for the tire and you should have to force it in . I have put these in before so I know how to do it. But this one fit right in the rim and I could seal the tire without any effort at all, the problem is the tire and tube are too loose and it feels like riding on a flat tire. It should fit so tight and feel rock hard to work right."
5,No More Leaks!,"Pretty easy to change out & put in the airless tubes. They weigh a ton, but wife's getting used to it (they were for her bike). They ride well & actually cushion better than the tubes did. Of course the biggest benefit will be that I never have to patch another tube. She rode the bike ONE time, got a ram's horn sticker in both tires & the front was flat before she got it home. Great Product! I may get a set for my 10-speed. Negatives: Price - initial investment is a lot, but it will pay for itself very quickly - when I got them installed I showed her how they worked by poking an Ice Pick into the tire."
2,Mushy ride,"I bought one of the 26x1.75-1.95 size, and it fits right, was relatively easy to install, but it's too soft-it feels and looks like I'm riding with a half inflated tire. I put it on the front only to test it before doing both tires. Excellent idea and concept, just need to perfect the material, or make a range of different materials for people to choose from. I'm also 220+ lbs, so I tend to put a lot of stress on my tires too :-)"
1,Terrible quality.,"Soon as received, it was out of order. I tried to refund but no way to find the way due to disorganized web site design of Amazon."
4,Pioneer IP-Bus,"works so far, wish there was another way so i dont have to buy splitters for amp and subs, but it works and it allows me to listen to my music, which is better than the radio that plays the same songs over and over"
5,Great Book,This is a great book for those of you that are interested in the Cornish Rex breed. Greta really knows the breed from ear to the tip of the tail.......thanks to years of experience.A MUST READ!!!
3,"It's Ike, with no frills","I suppose it delivers what it promises and there's nothing wrong with the quality of the speeches. I just would've liked some more historical context for each in the liner notes, which were spare, to say the least."
1,Not a user friendly book,"This book may have some nice rides in it, but I wouldn't know how to find them! There is no index of towns, nor any map that could help you to actually drive to the start of a ride. The one ""map"" covers half of California and just has a bunch of circles and numbers. A guide to cycling should also include some sense of how to get to the start! Sure, I could choose one of the 40 rides and start Googling the towns mentioned in the description, but that seems like an awful lot of work. If I am going to Calistoga (for example), I'd like to be able to flip to the page that shows Calistoga or at least to a map that is detailed enough to help me understand where the rides are in relation to Calistoga (of Napa or Sonoma or whatever). This book fall very flat, due to this major oversight."
4,I love this movie,"I have loved it ever since I saw it in 1991( I was 10 at the time). It came on Tv. and I was hooked ever since. It was so so hard to find this movie. I always wanted to rent the movie, but the video stores never had it. I found it on amazon, so I had to buy it. I am now the proud owner of this hard to find movieThis is your teen movie you have to see. The ending made me cry, well almost. Karen totally did Gary dirty, after all that he did for her, when she got pregnant by his friend, who didn't want to claim the baby.Gary was to nice, but he was in love with the girl. But I don't know if I would talk to my friend who did something like that to me. especially since he knew gary liked Karen."
5,Greatest Movie Ever!!!,"This is a great movie. I only wish I could buy it, but it is really really REALLY hard to find. IF you can get it, jump at it because the movie rocks.I am serious, this movie is sooooooo great."
1,This is an American translation to an Israeli Film,"This is a step by step, one by one, copy of a famous Israeli film called 'Eskimo Limon,"" made years earlier."
5,Best Teen Movie In My opinion,"This has to be one of the best teen movies there are out there. Dealing with teen issues such as love, sex, and growing up. It starts off with the one guy who sees the new girl in town and falls head over heels with her, only afraid to ask her anything. That error leads to his friend dating her afterall. The story goes from there and it has an ending unlike any other movie that I have seen. If you like teen movies, then this is a must for you. Unfortunately, its out of print. I had to hunt down for this and finally nabbed myself a copy of my own through Ebay in great condition."
5,A great caricature of 80s teen angst,"LAV's darkly comic overtones and well-matched score (includes The Tempatations, REO Speedwagon, and Devo) helps it escape from becoming another formulaic 80s teen movie. Although the politically correct may cringe at some of the raunchy and insensitive humor, I personally think that this over-the-top element gives LAV its uniqueness. The acting is pleasingly predictable, and the characters are solid cliches. But this acts in favor of the movie, as it delivers exactly what one craves from one of these films: raunchy laughs, cheesy angst, and painfully bad fashions."
4,"Legends of the Guardian King, Book 3 - Great, as was 1 & 2","Legends of the Guardian King, Book 3 was as great as Books 1 & 2. The story is multi-faceted and intertwined well. I am really enjoying this series of books."
3,small grill,This grill is smaller than I thought it was going to be but its ok and works well. the directions to assemble were a little confusing as to which screws to use when. all in all its ok and serves its purchase
2,it did what is was suppose to do,"bought the grill over six years ago. it has been covered after each use and maintained in a reasonable fashion. the outside is ok, the inside has simply fallen apart.....twice. Like I said is has been cleaned after use and oiled etc. cheap grills, that rust and fall apart. the grill is used at our vacation home so its use is VERY limited. if you want a diposable grill buy it. Parts are difficult to come buy and everytime I have called customer service it was a nightmare."
2,Software Problems,"While the scanner itself is excellent and I really wanted to like it given its design and feature set, I had fatal problems with the photoprint application after I upgraded to XP (even after downloading and installing the XP drivers). I also had some difficulties before the XP upgrade. Epson has diddle for tech support (there is a mailing address and a hard to reach phone support & zero e-mail support.)"
2,Problems with XP,"I've had to unplug this scanner and remove all of the Epson software because it was causing so many problems with my HP Pavilion 760n running Microsoft XP...the drivers did not work, downloaded drivers did not pass Microsoft's ""logo test"" and the software apparently messed with my soundcard drivers to the point where I had to run a system restore to put everything right...not worth the trouble!! I would love to know what scanners really work with XP..."
3,It won't scan slides!,"I bought recently (March, 15th 2002) an EPSON Perfection 1650 Photo scanner. It works Ok save a very annoying problem: when scanning slides mounted in a frame it will only capture about 80% of them: two horizontal rows at the top and the bottom are not ""seen"" by the scanner:A 35 mm slide have as measurements 3.50 x 2.30 cm but the scanner will only capture 3.28 x 1.96cm. This means that a row of 0.22cm wide at the base of the slide is not captured and the same happens with a row of 0.34cm at the top.Apart from that the output quality for slides is, frankly, dissapointing and I need to adjust manually each slide before scanning it."
3,Don't hula too much over this book,"I searched and searched with all of my excitement to find out all that I could about getting married in Hawaii. I had searched many webpages over along with many coordinator's sites and then found this book and purchased it. It did not tell me anything more than what information I could find online already and piece together. Get it if you don't plan on doing any other research, I would just be concerned about using this one source for such an important event."
5,The Premier Giude Book for Backpacking,Thoroughly compehensive in detail and enjoyable to read. Mr. Townsend covers all aspects of backpacking with very informative knowledge and excellent suggestions from camping gear to proper fitness. Highly recommended reading to anyone who is interested in this area.
2,Long for short guys,The shirt is a 32-33 sleave length but the total shirt length is down to your knees. Why if a man has short arms would the maker assume he is tall and need this length down to his knees?
4,"Une musique cyber-punk, simple, d'une grande beauté.","Je suis obligé de mettre 4 étoiles car 4.9 n'existe pas et 5 est pour la perfection. Je n'avais jusqu'à cet instant ou telles intensité et harmonie musicales exprimées dans tant de simplicité. Certains morceaux vous transportent jusqu'à un paroxyme éphémère musical et intellectuel proche du nirvana. Cette musique très moderne pourtant exécutée avec des instruments traditionnels réussit à nous faire sentir le monde futur avec ses enjeux humains bien anticipé par le manga. La musique seule nous suffit. Un moment de pur bonheur quoi. Mais cher, c'est juste. Cependant j'ai moi aussi cédé pour cette musique car elle est rare."
2,Disappointed!! It's missing the most important music!,"I loved the movie so much I wanted to have the music at my fingertips, so I ordered this CD. P>I was happy for the first song, but there are 2 other songs which are close copies of it. Yes, the other tracks are techno/mood music, but mostly really quiet, calm stuff.This CD is missing what is in my mind the most important, most energtic, and most upbeat tune from the movie: the song playing at the end as the camera panned up the city and throughout the credits! Yes, it's neat having some tiny pics from the movie and production in the booklet, but I have to brush up on my Japanese to understand anything in there.I guess I have to go back to looping through the last track on my DVD and hopefully I can rip that music from it in the near future!!"
5,better than Akira,"Very, very good soundtrack - in the lines of other Akira, etc. A must for contemporanery Japaneese music. Expensive though."
2,Where's the volume?,"Someone recommended this movie to me, so I bought it and looked forward to the day in came in the mail. Here's the problem: while the movie looked promising, especially the eye-bulging appearance of Tina Louise in her flimsy night gowns showing showing off her unbelievably beautiful breasts to best advantage, the volume track on my DVD was just too low. Granted, I'm hard of hearing and have to rely on subtitles to get everything (sadly missing on this product),but I actually had to turn my TV's volume setting up to 100, and still I couldn't make out what the actors were saying. If the volume were better so that I could understand what people are saying, I'd love this movie. It's a visual treat, with a great performance by Robert Ryan, but no good when you can't hear it. So please, either fix the audio track or add subtitles. Then I'll be a fan."
5,DVD - God's Little Acre,"I received my order quickly and in excellent condition. I was please with everything about this company. I will order from them, again."
3,A little different than the book but I liked it.,I wanted to see this movie because I read the book. I also like older movies. The book is a little better than the movie. I happen to believe most books are better than the movies. The ending is even a little different.
4,Very cute!,"This little stool is beautiful and easy to assemble. Sturdy, but I wouldn't go jumping on it! Well worth the very low price!"
5,Perfect Vanity Stool,I ordered this for my daughter and was so surprised at how great it looked! It was perfect.She'd seen it on another website and it was a bit more expensive. Unfortunately there was a crack in the wood but I still like it so I'll just send it back for another!
2,you get what you paid.,"I saw this stool on amazon which is really cute, and was going to use it as makeup vanity chair. The shipping was fast, and it came in nice packaging. However, the paint on the chair wasn't good at all, it not evenly painted. Anyways, it was only less than 20 dollars, i couldn't expect more. 2 weeks later, just earlier today, one of the leg fall off. I was speechless. I knew it was a cheap stool, I didn't know it was THAT BAD."
5,Grizzly G5970 Electric Palm Sander,This is a great little sander for small jobs. It's real easy to put on the sand paper. The bag blows off but you really don't need it. It works great!
5,what a great book to have,this is a wonderful book to have with clear illustrations if English is not the prior language. I did not hesitate leaving it in one of the villages in Kenya.
3,"Nice, but could be better.","The title says it all.It was Almost, everything I hoped for. It was awesome in covering the UnderTaker's streak matches from start to finish. Good video and audio quality and excellent condition upon arrival. However as a personal preference, I would have liked to see the promos for the matches as far as what led up to them, to help set the stage so it has the full dramatic effect instead of just going straight into live action. Also I would prefer to see his celebration after his matches. Like a couple of them he wins the Heavyweight Championship title. Though we know how he does it, it's still an awesome sight to see. My only other ""remark"", and take it how you will, would be the commentary on ""The Streak"". It was great to hear the other superstars commenting on it and how awesome it was, but it was kind of lacking to not hear the Deadman himself give a few remarks about it.All in all an excellent buy, but I wonder how it will end. Phenom forever!"
3,Alright buy,"Bought this for my 8 year old son as a birthday gift. He was so excited for it. Then when he found out the whole match wasn't on it was let down. It did pass the time, but he has yet to watch all the discs. They also don't get into much on it. I suppose it's ok"
4,great deal,"I was very pleased with the DVD. It was actually a present for someone else for their birthday and just seeing the look on his face I knew he loved it, and I definitely loved the price. The shipping was fast and I'm very happy I looked on Amazon to find it."
2,"For a good night's sleep, try Nyquil..or this DVD","The latest compilation released by WWE focuses on the Big Nasty himself, the Undertaker. What's so different about this, just the latest in a handful of 'Taker DVDs previously for sale? This one puts the spotlight on the man and his ""iconic"" Wrestlemania winning streak. In other words, most of the decent matches that ""Booger Red"" has had in his WWF/E career are on other sets.By far the best match here is the bloodbath vs Ric Flair. Even in his 50's, Flair was able to get an exciting performance out of his opponent. The matches vs Shawn Michaels are very good also, if a bit overrated.Get ready to FFWD thru 'classics' like 'Taker vs Giant Gonzales, 'Taker vs King Kong Bundy, and not one, but 2, snoozers against Kane."
2,I hope this is not just a money grab by the WWE,"Ok we all know the matches that will be on this DVD. Listed in first post if you don't know. Lets be honest about this DVD, how many of us already have these matches on other releases. (I have 11,12,13,14,15,18,19,20,21,22,23, and 24 already). On top of this not every match was good (anyone remember WM 9 or 19 for example). Unless this has comments from the wrestlers on the matches, their really will be nothing that draws me in to buy this DVD."
3,Decent,"This airplane tolerated about 2 months of fun in the pool until it got a leak. Having said that, if you're looking for a one summer pool toy, it's great fun for the little ones. It balances well in the water and the kids love to bounce around on it."
3,Adventurous for a 4- 5 year old.,Fun little toy. Helps with balance. Easy to get on and fun to float around in
5,you need this,"Perfect tool for the job. I have used this 3 times and lent it to friends and co-workers. Easy to use, and makes a difficult task fairly simple."
5,Machines In The Right Hands!,"Early '80, Los Angeles, time of musical revolution.Ice T, machines, new kind of dances.This movie is a good example about what happens when creative people meet the right instruments.This movie is a document about the events of that time!This movie is in the history!Salvatore Mono"
4,remember when,"I almost fell over when I saw that they re-released this classic. It is a classic that examines the culural importance of this form of street dance and gives it the honor and respect to acknowledge its influence it has on modern dance. These kids have worked really hard and it has a great lesson about confidence,determination, and faith. It is really cheesey yes, but it is a great story for young viewers, it is fun, and the music is classic. I also love the references to Fred Astaire that Michael Chambers, a highly skilled and talented dancer, is honored to present. The sequel is also worth viewing."
5,nice for it's purposes,"This little gem does not have a headphone jack and obviously, it does not have a cassette player, but it does have great sound for such a small device. It is so compact, for storage it fits neatly almost anywhere. Since I use it in a skilled nursing facility where I have to carry it around much of the day it's really great. When I first opened the box and saw it was so small, I was afraid it would not give good volume but the volume is adequate, and the CD player is very good. So while it may not have a headphone jack, for it's size and price this is really a nice box."
2,"5 star pans, 1 star handle","We have used these pans now for 2 years on multiple short and long trips. The pans are great, they stack so nicely. We often just take the large pan, the small, the lid and the frying pan. The problem is the handle. As one reviewer noted, to put it on you have to turn it at a 90 degree angle to the pot. You also have to pull back on a spring latch. We don't have to deal with a campfire as we use a gas cooking stove but just maneuvering is a problem. Overlooking that (which is not easy), when the handle is attached, if you try to pur something out of the pot, it swings in the direction of the handle so you have to be incredibly careful of someone had a lap full of hot food. The swing is only about 30 degrees but it an issue every time you need to pour out of a pan with the handle. I have searched for a different style handle and used my primus one but it is too small. I don't want to have to replace these but I also am tired to fussing with them."
4,Love that they stack,"I bought these to go in my travel trailer and not take up so much space. For that purpose, they are great. I, like other reviewers, wish that they came with one more handle. There was another set that did come with 2 handles, but it was quite a bit more expensive. This is just for camping, so I can deal with that. The handle is....interesting. I don't have a problem putting in on or taking it off, nor did I have a problem with it coming off while I was using it. That being said, you won't be able to put it on or take it off if your pan is hot. It is definitely a two handed job. Things do stick to these pans more than my good pan's at home, but I did pay less for these, so there it is. I don't think I'd buy these for everyday use, unless I have a very small kitchen (apartment) and was cooking just for 1 maybe 2, but for camping, these fit the bill."
4,Great Tea in Dented Cans,"I love this tea and often stick a chilled can in my bag when I leave the house. I just wish the company could solve their packaging problem. When I received my last order, 21 of the 30 cans were dented--some only slightly, some badly. That means only 9 cans were undented. Yet I will continue to order it because I love it (and can't find it in any local stores)."
2,I got a chill and the only cure is more marshmallows,"which I did not get here! I agree with the other reviewer, the marshmallows dissolved as soon as I added the hot water. Also, if you add the 3/4 cup of hot water suggested it only half fills a standard coffee mug. 120 calories in one packet seems like a bit much for not even a whole mug of cocoa. I switched toGhirardelli Chocolate Hot Chocolate Mix - Double Chocolate, 16 ozand add my own mini marshmallows."
3,Not bad but not entirely satisfying either,"Seeing the list of actors in this film it should be a recipe for success, however, while the first half, for me, was quite slow, and the whole film felt a little disjointed and strange. i can't really say what I disliked about it, beyond that, but it just left me feeling somewhat dissatisfied."
3,Slow predictable one-line story,"This movie is a good work as a ""first"" for a new director but nothing special outside that context. Its one-line story is fairly predictable and barely enough to fill up a TV sitcom episode, diluted up into amovie. The photography and music is four star, acting was also good except for the leading male.A big ""Apple"" logo on a laptop is an acceptable commercial but the long close up scene of a smoking leading actress is not OK in this day and age when even Phillip Morris is concerned about cancer."
2,"Eh, not so great","If you like watching hypocritical rich people in impossibly fancy New York apartments with glamorous jobs and equally glamorous looks do nothing in particular, then this is the movie for you."
5,the real review,"first off, the people who reviewed this below who said the drums sound bad are out of their minds. get rid of your 1980's boombox that has 2 inch tweeters in it. sure, its ""raw"" but thats the name of the album. its not some over-produced thing that sounds like a studio recording (with faded in ""cheers""... woooo!) but it doesnt sound like a bootleg either.second, richard christy shines when he plays with Death. just flat out beautiful brass work. you can listen to this thing just for the drumwork and be blown away. some of the fills he adds into the older songs like ""suicide machine"" with the double ride/double bass stuff is flat out disgusting.third, this is chuck. hes a metal deity basically. all you have to say is ""chuck"" and everyone knows who youre talking about. if you cant enjoy this guys work, seriously, just stop listening to metal altogether."
1,No Better Than 1250 I Returned,"I returned two Epson 1250's, figuring anything by Epson couldn't be lousy (I have owned many Epson printers over the years...all were great). Then I bought the 1650. I found only one difference - no dust under the glass, Otherwise, it was the twin brother of the 1250. Poor color match, slow & noisy, awful software. Called Epson more than once and nothing improved. My 4th scanner was a Canon N670U. I've had it for a month now and it has been excellent. Perfect color and much faster than the Epsons."
2,Returned it.,"I had read the various reviews and went ahead and bought the scanner anyway. Others had complained about the scans being very dusty, crooked, etc.I had the same problems, the scans were consistently dusty and very distorted at the edges of the glass. Even on a black image, the scan was full of white specks. Completely unacceptable. I returned the scanner. Maybe there was just a bad batch of this model based on the number of bad reports here.Cannot recommend :("
1,Worst of The Worst,"This movie is so bad it is funny. The casting was terrible and their attempts at serious acting was only over-shadowed by the cheap and tacky looking props. Don't buy this movie for a serious movie, buy this movie for a side splitting laugh. The topper was me was a NASA scientist that sounded so fresh off the farm you could smell the hay."
5,I was astonished by this book,"The first chapter alone is worth the price of this book. But it gets better from there. Capon is a playful writer; thought provoking and interesting to read.Capon summarizes 2000 years of church history, analyzing the good and the bad from the various church models that have been used, and then closes by stating some ideas for the models of the future. If you are planting a church, or trying to transform your church into something more mission-oriented, I highly recommend this book."
3,Welcome to the greatest city on EARTH!!!!,"Good performance by M Fox, but some aspects of the book do not translate well as Leonard Maltin points out. Worth seeing for a glimpse of NY in the 80's during the greed period. Read the book, it is very good."
3,Venice travel,"I am sure the book is the ideal travel book for Rick Steves' other books are, but I decided that I didn't want to go to Venice."
1,Goldwell Topchic Professional Hair Color(P-Mix),"Product do not work, my hair remain the same colour after applying the dye and they wash off like shampoo. No response from the seller at all after my complain very disapponted with the service."
1,NOT for Joggers,"This CD player is NOT for joggers. While I was walking at a fast pace, but not jogging, the CD player skipped for a second or two, which isn't too bad. As soon as I started running, it stopped playing, when I stopped running, it started playing again. It doesn't work when you are running!! Please, if you work out, don't get this player, go get the Sony Sport!!"
1,Hagar Marching To Mars,"Hagar's worst.Hagar's very-very worst.This reminds me of Yanni. So if you like jammin-to-Yanni, you'll love this CD."
3,A Strange twist in the tale,"I wondered what kind of direction Sammy would take here after his twisty days with VH. The answer turned out to be every direction. The Red Rocker has gone with hard rock, acoustic, funk, watery balladry, just about the whole kitchen sink on this one! I suppose inviting all these guest stars along was a ploy to bury new VHs attempt, but Eddie and co. managed that all by themselves. I enjoyed about half the tunes on Marching to Mars, but too often Sammy seems to be falling out of touch with what's happening these days. I really didn't think that before VH, he had made a consistently good album since ""Standing Hampton."" If you really want to hear Hagar at his absolute finest, search high and low for Montroses' debut album and ""Paper Money."" These mid-seventies releases know how to rock!"
3,badSoftware,"I bot this scanner and have scanned 50 color photos.The scan quality is generally good (better than 610) but the software is [poor]. You just cant scan to a file..The fullauto mode works ok though. The scanner makes a lot of noise (like a chopper). It takes 90 seconds to scan a color photo at 300 dpi.In general, I would say, You can buy this scanner, if you dont care too much about the noise and speed and care only abt quality."
2,Not For Serious Microscope Users,This is a book aimed at children or novice adults.There is nothing in it for an experienced microscopist.
1,Found this book on the trash bin...,"...and it made me reminisce about the days when the title ""journalist"" meant something. Orth is no journalist. She's a gossip monger, repeating hearsay from unidentified sources for a dollar. If only we could return to the days when real news was on the front page, rather than old biddy lies and gossip about Elvis, Michael Jackson, or the victim du jour. Thanks for nothing, Maureen Orth."
2,Sigh. . . .,"Well, it seemed like a good idea and I wanted to love it. . . . I purchased this bracelet for one of my son's friends, who just turned 16 and loves the theater--and I'm decidedly disappointed. The drama masks are so small one can barely see them and the sterling silver feels featherweight. I could see paying $20 or even $25 for this, but, personally, I don't think it's worth $40+. I wish I had time to look for something else. The image shown gave me the impression that, while not of significant size, the masks would at least be identifiable from a short distance. And they're really not. Maybe it's me? Both of the prior reviewers gave it five stars and said they thought it was wonderful. But I have to say, for me. . . not so much."
2,The Korean War (4 volume set),"I remember this product sold as in ""great condition or almost like new"" and it looks shaby and like it was handled a lot to where the case shows it. Not too happy about this purchase. I will be more careful next time"
2,It looks good.....,"It looks good though it's bigger for my size. After a month using it the day,24 and dates hands are not working at all....."
2,Grandad,"Bought this watch for a good friend. Thought it was a good buy,but it's not worth more than I paid. It looks and feels cheap. Needless to say I did not give it to my friend but threw it in my lower desk drawer."
1,Tedious read ...,"This is simply not a good book, and it was a waste of money to buy it. The narrative is forced, and the result is bland.Beware of Ph.D.'s who insist on being called ""Doctor"" all the time. It smacks of rather tacky insecurity. I speak as one with a doctorate of my own."
3,Wrestling video,"This was bought as a gift. The price was fair and the shipping was quick. The gift receipiant was happy with this video, as he is a big wrestling fan."
4,Good Tool,The thin long shank is preciesely what I needed to work on treadmills. Some of the screws are in rather deep pockets with little room to manuver so I bought this screwdriver. Works fine.
4,Writing about the World,"I like this book, it's interesting and well explained. I was just little disappointed with the shipment, because the book was little dirty and not properly folded."
4,Keeping up Appearances Season 2,"Although I really enjoy the show and am new to watching instant videos, I was disappointed to see the episodes mixed up. Episode #6 was missing and instead was #10. #10 was a repeat of #9. Luckily for Youtube I could watch the missing one."
5,amazing talent,"Laura Veirs is certainly among today's finest American songwriters with Lucinda Williams. Every single song on this album is a pure diamond. This third record published in 2003 is, like Carbon Glacier (2004), a definite masterpiece. Laura Veirs is an amazing artist, a gifted poet, a compelling composer and an extraordinary interpret/guitarist. What is so touching in 'Troubled by the Fire' is that Laura sounds real. All her songs reflect genuine experiences and human feelings which cannot leave anybody indifferent. This album is undoubtedly a work of genius but one of Laura's talents (and not the least) is to make combinations of complex harmonies, sophisticated lyrics and rythms sound as simple and obvious as real life... Thank you Laura, you really are an amazing person."
3,Almost perfect,"The product is pretty much exactly as pictured.There is absolutely no finishing to the ends, and they did spread a little. You would lose ~1/2 from either end to clean it up if you wanted it perfect.I was disappointed that there were several snags along the length. It's unlikely these happened in transit as it's packaged in plastic. If you're looking for a perfect hose cover, expect some blemishes. If you want to spend 8 hours tracing tiny wires, maybe you could pull it in like a snagged sweater. Good luck.That's the reason for the three star rating. I wasn't covering a hose though, I was using it as a mesh strainer for a home brew kettle. It worked well for that, so a few creases and snags here or there didn't really bother me.It's not a perfect product, but for the price... you're probably not using this for a show car. I wouldn't anyway.No problems with the supplier or packaging."
3,Woods in the Woods,This game is way to hard almost so much so that you get frustrated and quit. The shots are never the same. You can't get any good control of the ball and forget the shots using the Wedge clubs!Just to hard to have any fun with it!
5,"Fun game, but it does take practice","This game is so much fun. It does take some practice to get your swing down, but once you do that, you are golden. If you play the career mode, what helps alot is playing enough to increase your skill points and also earn enough money to buy better equipment."
2,Don't get it!,"This game is not as good as the reviews make it sound. The sounds are annoying, the action is boring. Seriously disappointed."
5,Great Game,"Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is an excellent game. The graphics are stunning and look more like a movie than a game. To say the storyline is odd is an understatement but it's odd in a good way. Controls are easy to use and you switch from third person to first person flawlessly during a battle. Voice acting is exceptional and can be quite entertaining, especially when your ammo starts insulting you. Pick it up as at least a rental, it's worth it."
1,Not compatible with 360: found out the hard way,"I recently purchased a 360, bought some games, including both from xbox and xbox 360's lineup. Strager's Wrath seemed like it would be a good game. Unfortunately, when I popped it in, an error message popped up, saying that this game couldn't be played. I probably should've done some more research, but that's my fault."
1,Not true to photos,"Just purchased this box from Amazon and box DOES NOT CONTAIN FOAM FOR BROADHEADS as depicted in the photos. Simply, box cannot effectively hold broadheads without the foam."
2,"Okay, not great","I love werewolf films, but this one was okay but not great. A group of American soldiers return from the war infected with lycanthropy. The group splits up hoping to get over the trauma, however, several band together and decide to embrace their animal instincts.It was really unclear whats going on, but some of the group are searching for one of the men- Jake who they want to join them. Then there is a group of older American vets who are hunting the entire pack. They seem to be fighting and killing eachother... But I'm not entirely clear why.I did think the werewolves who were partially transformed looked sort of cool. And I liked the ending. But I admit I need more plot and more characterization to make me think this was a good film. A little more character development, and plot would've made this film shine rather than simply fizzle."
4,"Really worthwhile throughout, with a couple of ""stay with you"" moments.","Surprisingly good, as another review said already. I grabbed it off the shelf because I need to inject a little humor into my gore. It looked pretty cheesy, but it's actually rather compelling, and a little bit deep and thought provoking, with main and side characters that you end up caring about. I rented it, I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to recommend it to my friends. Nicely done."
1,Garbage!!!,"Don't waste your money like I did!!! I plugged this thing in, I could hardly hear it out in the open( not in pillow). It sounded very tinny like an old transistor radio. The next thing I noticed is only one speaker worked. I decided to take this thing apart. To no supprise the wires were hair thin and the speakers were cheap junk. This is the worst product I ever bought from Amazon! If this is a deluxe model, is the regular version two paper cups and a string?"
3,complete but,Bulgarian people understand more or less Russian partitions. It's an honest version but do not have great expectations. Other versions as Melik-Pachayev are less complete but much better.
1,I REALLY Didn't Like This Film...,"I'm sorry to say this... But I really didn't like this film at all! I thought the acting was horrible, the plot was laughable and the scripting was even worse. If there's one thing I have to say positive about this film, it's that it's often quite hilarious. Moments are just that bad...All of that being said, I could tell there was some notable effort on the parts of the child actors, and I hope they continue to act and grow successful!"
1,I lost brain cells,"This didn't even get me through the 45 minutes of a 10 hours flight to Rome. I did read the in-flight magazine cover-to-cover though!This book is not only poorly written and haphazardly put together (choosing your own adventure sometimes makes the story end ridiculously abruptly, making me read the first part over and over again), but it is also tied together by racist and cultural stereotypes that continue to damage the Mexican psyche. Latin lovers, dirty bathrooms, drug pushers, illegals running for the border...they are all in here and without humor or irony -- just clear cut racism...."
3,review of 101 Small Business Ideas for Under $5000,This book gives you ideas for a small business along with suggestions when entering into a business. It gives different ideas on starting a new business.
2,Too small,"This is much smaller than I anticipated. There are no dimensions listed in the description - I assumed the photo space would be wallet sized. The slots are less than 1.5"" x 2"". This merchant's shipping charges are too high. They charged $16 for this tiny little item which does NOT weight 1.6 pounds - maybe 1.6 oz. Dont bother with it!"
1,Extremely bad info,"I was extremely dissapointed in this guide. The only thing that's worth reading in it are the historic section and the maps. The rest is far too badly descriptional, without any kind of recommendation. The accomodation index describes the hotels in less than two lines, if so. The cities are described in cold tones, without any good reason if you should even go to them. As for an example, take Andorra, that is included in this guide, and despite it's quite close do Barcelona - about 2 and a half hours by bus - It really destroyed my mood to going there. When we travel, mainly those who work and to do that put a lot of effort and investing, want concise and critical description of the places they want to go, so we cant take good advantage of our lack of time. This is not valued in this book. After reading it, you feel you could do better sitting in your room, watching TV, and even then you would be more excited. That's a crime for a travel planner! Lonely Planet: never more."
2,A self-indulgent journey and journal,"As a breast cancer survivor, this book was recommended to me by the proverbial friend-of-a- friend. (Who, as it turns out hadn't actually read ""A Breast Cancer Journal."") I read it with hope, hoping to find a kindred spirit. What I found was a self-indulgent, egocentric account that paints the author as virtually the only woman who has had to struggle with this terrible disease. That Wittman is a technically clever and adroit writer, there can be no doubt. Like a good Hallmark card, she knows what buttons to push. But reading between the lines one finds a woman engaged not so much with how her disease might leave those she could possibly leave behind, or those committed to helping her or who love her, but a woman for whom the disease has provided an outlet for what I am sure is a considerable ego. There were moments in reading it that I almost felt sicker than during some of the worst moments of my illness. Read at your own risk."
1,The refill is a SINGLE ? For more than cost of full pen?,"Surely there must be some mistake. Granted it was difficult to find much of a description for ANY of the refills for the EnerGel pens, but since the refill here is priced more than what the original pen sells for at local office stores - and given my consistence experience that Amazon gives great deals - I decided I'd order one (no shipping charge with Amazon Prime anyway).Well, I was *not* pleased to discover a tiny little barely-padded envelope with exactly 1 (one) refill.What a joke.Hopefully this note will let you know to shop locally for refills - or just throw away the entire pen and buy a new one for less than refill price.[ fyi: one of my extremely rare 1-star ratings. ]"
4,Great Movie,"Liked the movie, had to watch it twice to get all the little bits of information to understand movie. Recommend it to everyone"
3,Not what I thought,"I was thinking this would be a step-by-step process of how to sew different fabrics. It doesn't read like a book, either, just a fabric description....very sterile and NOT for the novice sewer at all."
1,Don't waste your Time!!,If you really want a good book on comfort foods - BUY RACHEL RAY'S COMFORT FOODS!!Don't waste your time with this book - none of these recipes comforted me at all!Besides -- the author is nothing but a big complainer anyway!!
1,not a good purchase,"I have made a few of the recipes from this book... very bland and tasteless... try Rachael Ray's books, as they are wonderful!"
5,A pioneering work,This is a pioneering work in studying Jewish political structures from Biblical times down to the present. One of the surprising revelations here is the degree of autonomy that Jews often had in their communal life when living in difficult and straitened circumstances.
4,Ocicat book,"A very nice book that any Ocicat owner should have. Although it was written quite a few years ago, it is still very relevant. A lovely book about a lovely breed of cats!"
2,Not another Immortalizer,"Not worth buying, leave it on the shelves. Their views on politics are pretty common. Basically, inflamatory complaints about facism (in America?) Their ideas on the creation of the world are oddball, interestingly so. But, I listen to music for the music, not the lyrics. They should go back in time and make Legend of the World up to par with Immortalizer. In short, I'd rather listen to Rage Against the Machine any day."
3,"Horses and Mysteries, A Good Combination","I knew nothing of this author, but found the book, At Risk, for free on Amazon. Since I love horses and mysteries, I thought it would be a great read and I did enjoy the book. The book started off well, but after a few chapters I found myself skimming to get past the slow parts and the profanity. I felt the main character should have had the backbone to stand up and say NO to having sex with a woman he had no feelings for. Since the author opted to not give him any backbone in this situation he could have at least toned down the sex scene. Sometimes too much information is just bad taste. I felt Steve's betrayal of the woman he loved was disappointing and was also disappointed that she wasn't more outraged by his actions. With a little less explicit sex and a little more backbone this could be a great book."
3,At Risk,"I like Mysteries and thought this was enjoyable.It lacked a real substantive plot, had limited characters and read quite slowly in parts.The main character was simple, but ok for a quick read that did not cost anything from Amazon"
3,blehhh...,it's alright. i like horses and mysteries so this was an okay book i guess. i could tell it wasn't really well thought out
4,WELL DONE!!,An intriguing murder mystery and romance all wrapped up in one book. The suspense keeps the reader anticipating and expecting almost anything usual or unusual.
3,pretty good,Spent alot of time mucking the stables. Otherwise it was pretty fast paced. Steve was like a Timex watch; took a licking and kept on ticking. A good read.
5,Zest. Gusto. Curiosity.,"I thought when I saw the title and the author that the book would be related to just Sci-Fi writing, but it goes beyond that. This is one of those easy reads that provides pleasant inspiration.Mr. Bradbury tells stories from his life and how those stories turned into some of his great fiction. He presents the information in a way that the reader gets to go ""Ah, I can do that, too."" And, isn't that what inspiration is really all about. Seeing or reading or hearing something and going, ""Ah, I can do that,"" and then doing it in your own voice and time.For Bradbury it comes down to a few simple elements: ""Zest. Gusto. Curiosity."" If you have those things you, too, can be a writer.It's a cheap little paperback that's a must read for anyone looking for a little ""Aha"" inspiration."
4,good read,"A completely different look on the Old West - the way it truly was through letters. Some things are repetitive in the letters; but it paints a great portrait of how California was during the gold rush years, I wish the year before and a few years after were added to get an even bigger vision of how San Francisco changed in just a matter of years. If you're a history buff you will like it..."
4,Good book for Toddler of any age,"... I ... read to my 20 mo. old at night. She loves it -- we read it twice each night before bedtime. My little girl has her ""silk"" which has to go everywhere she goes so she can ""identify"" with Flora. The illustrations are wonderful..."
1,poor quality,Flashlight burnt out after 30 minutes of use. All my Pelican flashlights (3 so far) have died within 6 months of purchase.
5,"As expected, great product","The jars are exactly what I expected. Have used them and put them in the dishwasher multiple time and there has been no issues. It would have been great to have these in glass instead of plastic, so that they could go in the microwave as well."
3,the colors are not like the picture and it came broken.,"i wanted these to my 2 years old boy and as a gift to my nephew.but the colors are kind of sad,they are not atractive and in the two boxes,3 or 4 of chalks came broken.they should find a better way to protect it for shipping."
1,"cheap looking, thick manual","The picture looks quite nice and even elegant in a simple way, but the actual watch looks cheap, is rather heavy, and kind of seems like it's for kids. You know, they play tricks with the pictures. So, having impatiently waited to receive the watch, I was very disappointed with the look of it.And it comes with a thick manual! WHY?! You'd think an atomic watch should need NO manual, just turn it on and it should work right away, w/o you having to do anything ever.I dont know anything about the functionality of the watch yet, having just received it. It's probably good in that regard, but I havent had the time to read the several-page (!) manual and ""start"" the watch. And I already know that I will not recommend this watch. In fact I'm going to return it. Luckily shipping was free."
4,Good choice of capo for style and material,"I bought this specific capo for my son, who requested this brand, style, and material of capo, his favorite capo for guitar. This capo is durable and may be available elsewhere for a dollar or so less, but with buying another item from Amazon and receiving free shipping, it's a better buy here."
3,"Cruisin,(very little gas)",I have all of the albums and just got Cruisin. Nice CD for $. But not a penny more.This is not like Marc at all.It's almost as if he didn't want to do the music. Cruisin may have come out a little to soon. Some nice cuts that dont seem finished.
5,Alexander,Amazon.com is the only place I could find a replacement blade for my old grass shear. I now have a new out of date grass shear!
2,Tabloid Trash,"At best, this book should be looked at if you're interested in the facts behind the production of the film and you're able to look past Sammon's masturbative narrative.While the book is informative on what happened and the difficulties behind the making of the film, the author's writing ability is about the same as someone standing next to you with a bullhorn. Self-aware and bordering on narcistsic, Sammon's dirt-basic writing ability has a constant feel of ""Hey! I was here to see all this!"" attitude that really undermines his attempt at objective writing.Frustrating and amatuerish, ""Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner"" is an unworthy footnote and a worthwhile coffee coaster."
3,Average,Although the lead is performed by Domingo it just isn't that good. He's too operatic for this type of music. I've heard this piece of music performed better by lesser known singers.
5,I love this video,"I have had this video for years and it does EXACTLY what she says, Hips, Thighs and buttocks, no more and no less. I wore out my first tape by using it so much and now my second tape is almost wore out. I have always had trouble with my lower body and Denise makes it easy to work-out and get great results. Try it you will love how you feel about yourself."
5,Quick Shipping,"Shipping only took about 3 days.The Batteries I received are yellow with no red markings like the ones in image suggesting Sanyo product. Brand name should be in product description ,but I was just glad to find this size. If they work OK I will buy more."
1,More like ugly,"This is one of snoops worst songs. His albums seem to be progressivly getting worse. Too bad, at least we'll have Doggy Style (& multiple appearences on ""The Chronic"") to remember back when snoop could rap and make good music."
1,Incoherent!,"This book made no sense whatsoever. Mr. Butterworth seems to hold some very radical ideas, i.e., Jesus isn't really the Son of God. Add to that, the book is interminable. Butterworth goes on and on AND ON and doesn't really say one single sensible thing!"
1,"Don't Bother With This Bilge, Darlings!","Hello, my loves - Auntie Mame here. I just wanted to let you know that this particular book was written by a gentleman who is written up in cult manuals and for good reason: his coeterie of followers behave as if they worship him. It's quite revolting to watch, and yes, I've seen it in person. Spend your money on something else, darlings. This printed reiteration of egomania simply is not worth the price of it, and you wouldn't want to pay to poison your minds! Besides, there are better adventures to explore than this one. May I recommend ""Rachel's Tears"" by Beth Nimmo? It's above and beyond this Butterworth chap's crap. Love, Auntie Mame"
5,Discover The Power Within You,"Eric Butterworth's book Discover The Power Within You is fantastic! It lifts the veil of mystery from the spiritual experience. His message is simple and clearly stated, that if we will just excercise the power we all have in us by going within and communing with God, then we will no longer have discord in our lives. It is one of the most profound and moving books that I have ever read. I highly recommend it for anyone who is willing to take personal responsibility for their lives and wishes to co-create with God. Butterworth brings forth Jesus' beautiful message that we are all Gods (John 10:34) - not one more special or powerful than another. We need simply to WAKE UP! and recognize our own innate divinity."
4,enter the world of new age thinking,"Butterworth might provide you with some thought provoking ideas you may not have previously considered.Traditional (mainline denominational) ideas are not what you will find here. It is still Biblical, but the polity,dogma and other man made intrusions on scripture are not predominate in this reading. Treat yourself to the possibilities you may find in reading this."
5,Women in World War II,"I thoroughly enjoyed this historical novel. I knew what the women in America were doing for WW II, Rosie the riveter, Plane Spoters, Red cross workers and canteen volunteers.What amazed me was the active and brave work of the women in England and France. How families fought the enemy and worked seperately and together.I was fasciated with the lives and interaction of the people in this book and will look forward to reading the next book."
4,NFL Street 2,Fun game even once yoy beat it you can select other game types so theres like 5 different story modes. PVP is fun too.
5,Smells good with a musky undernote,Smells like lavander but it has a hint of musk in it. Very masculine smelling. Doesn't put out too much smoke but gives out a good scent.
4,Deliciously remixedified,"I've never been one to buy remix CDs. Something about listening to the same song six times in a row just doesn't appeal to me. But when I heard the Bike Thief remix on their website, I knew I had to have this. I checked on here and was lucky enough to snag a new copy of it for [...]. Definitely worth it. I think the only track I don't absolutely love is the Veronica Black Morpheus remix of Super Sprode. Other than that, I love every single one. They're all unique and amazing. I don't think I'd spend [...] on it, but you can always get it on iTunes."
3,Crying for an Editor,"This book has a lot of terrific information including the development of the meter, Jefferson's decimal mearsurement system, the development of surveying and the surveying of America. The author also has some good insights and perspectives on the effect of property ownership to the development of America and American's psyche.Unfortunately, the information is presented in a rather haphazard manner jumping from topic to topic and time period to time period. It definitely should have been organized in a better manner. A good editor could have put it together in amore coherent manner (wouldn't have hurt to restructure several sentences as well).There is a large amount of interesting history and information. If one can force oneself through the work the quality of the information makes it worth it. It will not be an easy road to travel, though."
5,Excellent guide through the world of business do's & don'ts.,"I found this book very easy to use, and extremely helpful in navigating the always-changing boundaries of what is considered good business etiquette. It shows that manners in everyday business life can make the difference between average and outstanding success within your company and in the world of business in general."
1,Boring,Having recently bought this book I was excited because it was set in my former hometown of Philadelphia but it was brutal geting through the entire book. I don't know who gave this person a book contract but they deserve a refund like I derserve one for buying this book.
5,Catastrophism theory; inspired by Immanuel Velikovsky,"This volume is a tome of scientific fact and minutia. However, if one can wade through the scientific method of explanation, a new paradigm of the reality of the Ancient Past comes vividly to life. This book is not for the casual reader, rather, students and professors of Palaeontology and Global Histology could benefit greatly in studying the alternative, challenging and provocative theories presented herein. At the very least, a class or two in Palaeontology would be helpful.A great read and a really honest mind bender! An adventure in paradigm busting at its finest!Ed MartellArlington, WA"
5,Stay At Home Floor Prodtection Pads,I love these pads. I have a dog that thinks you go in the house and one that is 15. They go on the pads and it protects my floor. I would recommend them to anyone.
3,Monotonous,"This book was well-researched and the chapter titles lead one to believe that there is a lot of information; however, the book repeats itself in each chapter."
5,The Greatest Metal Recording of All Time,"I've been listening to metal for 22 years now. I've heard them all. Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Guns & Roses, Metallica, etc.. Sad Wings of Destiny is just superior to all of those bands efforts. Get it NOW"
1,Very bad snap together shed.,"This shed is overpriced and is very poorly constructed and designed. The assembling is nearly impossible and even once assembled, the parts do not hold together securely. Things are held in place with snap together parts that do not fit well and do not hold together securely. I'm afraid to even touch it now."
2,Should have believed other reviews,Ordered this for outdoor storage of several bulky items. This thing is unfortunately really flimsy. I'm sure it leaks. And the lid has hit me in the head on several occasions-- it just does not stay up. Don't know what the alternative is and it was too bulky to send back. But would NOT recommend!!!
2,assembly is difficult,"I have had this for a week and can't put it together. I usually put furniture together by myself, so thought I could do it here too, but no. It came with no instructions and I don't want to send it back b/c it is so big and such a hassle - but I might have to."
4,Excellent book of Robert Williams Art,"This is really an excellent book that represents Robert Williams art. No other books are needed, it even has the painting used in the Guns 'n Roses Appetite for Destruction album. There's plenty of big beautiful prints in this large format book. I'd give it five stars but it turns out i'm not as much a fan of his art as i thought I was. The content is so busy and almost too much after a while. Maybe just soaking in a few prints at a time is the best way to enjoy it. With that said, deffinately a great addition to anyones art book collection."
4,Good boots,"I bought this boots for my brother that lives in Ukraine. He says he likes the quality. He had to walk about 1 hour through the rain and had his foots warm and dry at the end. He likes the style less than quality, but I guess those preferences are very personal."
2,Too similar to others,"This is the start of a series but only 1 other has appeared (plus a novella) so I guess it didn't sell well.There's a lot of talking - hero and friend, heroine and professor, hero and heroine. Also a bit of psychology.An OK book but there were too many questions unanswered - who was Terocus? Why did he collect occult material? What do the adepts actually want? Who was the villain and what was his agenda? (We only know his name and that he needs to ""renew"" his immortality). How are MI5 involved? Maybe later books would have answered them.The finale makes use of a ""deus ex machina"" where another adept turns up out of the blue and kills the villain. It's not explained how she was drawn into the affair.I actually finished the book so it's not all bad."
3,Started strongly but got way too predictable and muddled.,"This book is nothing like DaVinci code, and I was glad....at first. I was captivated and thought after the first couple of chapters I was in for a treat. Unfortunately, the suspense just totally peters out by the end, it became very predictable and I wanted to smack the ""heroine"" in the face. Supposedly she has this attractive, physically capable, intelligent, caring man in love with her but she can't love him back because she ""has to be her own person""?????? I have to agree there were quite a few inconsistencies, and I couldn't help but think that I was already familiar with the general idea, namely the first time I saw the movie ""Highlander"". I won't buy the sequel."
5,It really stays put.,"This product is relatively heavy, but the clip held it fine. I actually clipped it to my bed rail and it stays in place even on high speed - Very cool and super quiet.Thanks to Vornado - a super product."
2,Annoying Design Flaw,"The main problem with this adapter is that it defaults to simply power the laptop when it's plugged in. In order to make it also charge the laptop you have to press a button. I can't imagine a situation where I would want to only power my computer without also charging it and I wonder why this option is even available. However, if someone thought this would be something a user would want, why isn't the default to both charge and power? It's really annoying - especially when I forget to push the button, have it plugged in for a while and then realize the battery is still low.It's also very big and heavy and not the most practical for travel. All in all, the only thing it has over other adapters is that it can be plugged in to your car - an option I have only used once in the year and a half I've had it."
2,DOes this even work?,i've had this book for two months now and i havent noticed anything. are there any people who have recently seen results from this method. i dont want to waste my time if it wont work.
3,Info you should know,"I'm answering people's questions about this book if they should buy it or not? Well I haven't used this book yet, but if you order the book at thier home website, there is a 1 year money back warranty on it. So if you don't see results in 1 year, I think you can send it in and get your money back."
3,How To Grow Taller Books,Yes I read the book. It was a fair book but was easy flowing. It was missing many facts about nutrition such as the ones clearly stated in other books and online at such web sites such as http://www.growtall.com and http://www.sharpweblabs.com and http://www.hgfound.org. Overall the book was not bad but there is much room for improvement!
1,dont waste your precious money on this book...,"there's nothing worth mentioned in this book , it only tells you about some basic stretching exercises and food habits which i am sure all of us know . infact instead of buying this book i recommend you to buy some yoga book or write me at manu_1008@yahoo.com , i will send you all material that will help you immensely, this book is a sheer wastage of time and money"
4,Tunes for Bears to Dance to,"Well I'm only in 7th grade right now and well we read this for our class. The first thing i thought was ""oh a book....joy?? not gonna read this one"". But As I read a couple chapters the book just locked me into it. I felt as I was in the book myself. It was very interesting and a good plot. The story was based on the Holocost which to me was very scary. I sure didn't know much on that subject but the book helped me understand the meaning of it. Also had great vocabuly. I rated it a 4 1/2 stars. I think it was probably one of the better books that i've read in my class or outside."
2,Not His Best Work,"His short story, TIME FOR ME which is found in the Borderlands 5 anthology impressed me so much that I went out and bought this puppy.Can't honestly say this did the same for me. The prose is average, and even as a ""character study"" this was pretty average. The suspense is minimal, and the reader's overall affair with the characters will more than likely leave a bit to be desired.Still, it was a fairly entertaing read, but I went in with higher expectations. The writer seems to have great insights into female characters, but didn't really develop them as much as I know he could have.Just my 2 cents..."
5,Eggystorm,"Loved the book, written by Fred! Great hometown memories. Thanks for writing the book. Go Muskies, I can't believe a minimum of words is needed for a review."
4,"Brilliant, simply brilliant.","The book was good in that it went through the different processes of evolustion. It also explained very well how the beak of the finch signifys the changes in evolution. As well as going over ow the study of evolution has continued through today on Galapagos. It went throught individual proccesses of evolution such as meeting habits, competition, and how the best adapted for the enviroment survive(surival of the fittest). It goes in depth on how thinkgs like mating habits can be a major factor in micro evolution of organisms. Overall it was a good book and it is very efficeint in explaining the mechanism and ideas behind evolution while fitting into Darwin's adventure and current studies."
3,college text,I ordered this text for a college class. The book was exactly what I expected. The vendor was prompt and efficient. The content was boring.
4,Awesome Buy.,"Brie Larson did an awesome job. Among the tracks, Ugly, Life After You, and She Said are really inspiring yet lifelike songs that all teenage girls can relate to. I loved this CD."
5,Brie does it again!,"It's finally here! The long awaited CD from Brie Larson is out, and it is well worth the wait! With great music, lyrics, and Brie's wonderful voice, it's a awesome CD for many ages! Brie does it once again and dazzles us with her skills. She surely will go far!So go out and get Finally Out Of PE if you haven't already! It'll be well worth it! :)"
3,Really Good Cd,This CD was great it had a lot of good song on it and was really good music to dance too. So if your look for a cd with good song this is the cd for you.
5,I LOVE THIS CD MORE THAN ANY OTHER CD I HAVE!!!!,"i love this CD so much . all the songs are fabulus!! my favorites are life after you , done with like , loser in me , and go goodbye!! all teens/preteens will absolutly love this CD! satisfaction guarenteed!!"
3,Secret Origins of the Bible,"This is a very detailed look at the Bible with the author trying to match the Bible passages with history and his findings of the origins. It is very detailed and comprehensive. I know that some people really prefer that and so to them I say this is a very good book, it would also probably be a good book if you were going to write a paper on the subject. I'm still trying from time to time to read portions of it, but it is not for me, at least, a page turner."
4,Profound but Very Readable,"Once again David Almond writes a story that is at once accessible and profound. Once again his prose blurs the distinctions between the real and the imagined, and we enter into a world which feels real and yet has a hint of the magical about it.Joe Malone is a loner. He prefers teh open countryside to being cramped in school. He is surrounded by people trying to make him fit with their definition of what a man should be.When a small and dying circus comes to town, he finds a kindred spirit. In particular he finds someone who understands the reality of his secret heart.This is not a long book. Had it been longer the adults might be more fleshed out and less inclined to just induce conflict. But the book works as it is, and the conflicts of society's expectations and our own desires, and so much more are all explored here in another wonderful tale by this first rate author."
3,Interesting subject matter but slightly flawed,"After reading Skellig and Kit's Wilderness, I had high expectations for this more recent offering. When finished, I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. The material is interesting, and there's some beautiful imagery with the tiger, but the plot seemed rather weak. Also, Almond's depiction of traditional circus is inaccurate. I lived in such a circus for years and no one called us ""gyppo scum."" Some of the artists in this book are also displayed as grotesque freaks. Still, Almond's writing is always absorbing, and this is no exception."
2,Poor research?,"I wonder how accurate the rest of the book is when the author, Mr. Kershaw, did not care to notice that Dawson City, the Klondike, and surrounding region are not in Alaska but well inside Canada. He makes these erroneous references often."
4,Great for cleanup at work,I use these to clean up my face after being outside at work. Cuts down the grease and dirt quickly
2,This book is more for breeders....,"This book had some useful information, but I felt is was geared more towards breeders than new papillon owners. It goes into great detail about the pedigree and desirable qualities of a show dog. I was hoping to learn more about training, grooming, and general care."
4,one year old loves to push the button,"My one year old, loves to push the button to make the song play. I sing the song to her and she is mesmorized. She loves the song. The book also shows sign language, which I am teaching to my little girl."
2,Jessica made me want to kill myself,"Jessica travelled through her short, yet tragic life with these massive black clouds trailing over her head, yet she always managed to keep her perky faith in people, no matter how evilly they treated her. The evil (NOT step!!) mother, the pretty sister that envied her, her doting father. Good old Jessica, no matter what happened she always came back smiling. Saving the drunken lawyer, she even cured the insane. And the finale, killed by a poisonous, vengeful viper. A fitting end to the saga of Jessica's life."
1,Too sensitive,"It was a very easy install on my Hummer H3, but it was way too sensitive and there were so many false alarms, I took it off."
1,Someone please tell me it gets better....,"My Fater In Law bought this book for me several years ago. Every time I pick it up to read it, I remember why I stopped reading it in the first place. I get really frustrated at the idea that when I discipline my children, I am showing them conditional love, and that I only love them when they are good. The book goes on and on about this. I get so tired of reading the same thing written in different words over and over, that I finally put the book down in frustration. It's tempting to skip ahead, but I don't want to miss some important point....like how I SHOULD correct my children since apparently, I shouldn't ground them, or take things away when they do something wrong since that would only tell them I don't really love them because they make mistakes...Please someone tell me this book gets better and it's worth the time to read it. I see all these great reviews...Is there anyone who felt the same way I do about this?Thank you!"
4,Good all around.,"Although not great, this book is still essential. The interviews with famous people help to give you a better picture of the business. At times I do feel like they are trying to sell the idea of getting your product mastered rather than doing it your self. This book still helps though and has helped me with a couple technical things."
2,Flash Broke,This toy broke before the novelty wore off literally lasted 20 minutes before the flash stopped working. No rough treatment just simply stopped working.
5,Better than expected... way fun for adults and kids!!!,"So, this shadow magic thing has been kicking around the house for a while, and we finally decided to open it and try it out. I guess I didn't expect much. It has been so much fun. You have to make sure you hold the flash pen right and read the directions so you get awesome shadows. All 4 of my kids and my husband and I played it. It's well worth the money!! I hear the kids fighting over it right now. Should have bought a couple of them!"
5,"A useful, basic and practical guide to spirituality","I found Pam Grout's style entertaining and informative. She takes what could otherwise be considered complex, sophisticated concepts about the spiritual world. However, her use of everyday language makes her ideas approachable, easily understandable and non-threatening. Her simple, down-to-earth treatment uses contemporary examples to make what could otherwise be exotic seem reasonable. The title may imply a Christian slant, but it's a book for a much broader audience. What really makes the book work is the exercises -- 10 easy ways for the reader to prove (or disprove) the theories she presents. I found this such a useful little piece that I bought copies for several friends and relatives who I felt could benefit from the basic, optimistic tips for finding your own way in a loving, supportive universe."
5,One of the Best,"If you like a simple and clear approach to truth, cutting right to the core then this book is for you. This is one of my favorites because of its clarity and simplicity without the BS."
5,The Silence in Space,"What a satisfying read this book is. The title does say it all, Robert writes from the heart and his patience and kindness pervades this book. There is no confusion here, no understanding needed. The message just weaves itself in if you accept the invitation. A joy !"
5,A Nice Change,"I have had this DVD for a few weeks now and it has become my ""go to"" exercise DVD because not only is it a great workout, but I actually find myself enjoying it! Level 1 introduces some new types of exercise styles for me(such as Brazilian and Jiu-Jitsu) and I will admit I was a little lost in places the first time or two but they were a nice change from the typical workout moves. Once I did it a few times I enjoyed the moves even more and look forward to that circuit. Level 2 is no joke, it will kick your bootie. It is easier to follow then Level 1 was (coordination wise) but it makes me wonder if I will ever be able to do both workouts back to back. Love Jillians DVD's!"
3,Disappointing,"I have always enjoyed Jillian's videos. They're always hard and I always sweat a lot with them. However, this video wasn't so great. I don't know if I didn't read the reviews as well as I should have, but I didn't like the workout. It seems like there's a lot of yoga moves, which is fine, but I prefer more active moves. I also have issues with my shoulders and there's a lot of floor exercises with planks which I have a difficult time doing. I hate it when I get a video and it doesn't work me as hard as I was expecting or there's moves that I can't do because I'm not flexible. And, what's the point of having a video if you can't do all the exercises? I think the name of this video is a little misleading, it's not extreme shed & shred. Don't get me wrong you will sweat, but I was expecting more."
4,Classic Jillian and a great workout,"I have most of Jillian's workout DVDs and really like them and this one is no different. It's a great workout broken up into levels 1 and 2 yet she encourages everyone to do both of them together. I usually break them up just because of time contraints. One or two moves are hard to figure out (hip heists...still have no clue what I'm doing) but I like the inclusion of yoga moves along with all her other crazy hard moves. I'm a fairly conditioned athlete and I find this DVD challenging, especially if I do both levels 1&2 or just level 2. Thanks Jillian for another great DVD!"
4,Pretty cool,Pretty cool. I like that she puts in a lot of different kinds of exercises but it isn't all that challenging. I still use it about twice a month. It is about 40-50 minutes depending on the level. I like that I can fit it in in the morning. I just wish it was a little bit harder. I would still recommend because it is still a great DVD.
5,Great workout!,What a great workout this was. It worked me hard. I did level 1 and 2 combined today and felt it!!!It kicked my butt! Great addition to my collection! Thanks Jillian.
2,Bummed! Disappointed! Looking for more.....,"I have to say that the title and the business going on in the video do not go hand in hand. When I saw EXTREME and Shed and Shred I was excited. I thought I was going to get my butt kicked. I was seriously let down. Don't get me wrong I did a little bit of sweating......but only a little and I did a little bit of hard breathing......but only a little. I'll say it again, I wanted my butt kicked and the video didn't deliver.Jillian has incorporated some kind of funky, dance, karatee kind of movements in there that I could have done without. Yeah, they burned a little but my heart rate wasn't going and I was seriously bored.I would love to have a video that when I'm done I'm laying on the floor afraid to move and I was hoping this was the video."
4,Classic Jillian,"Me being the ""bananas"" one according to Jillian (naturally doing advanced modifications of moves), I did levels 1+2 together. Level 1 was...kind of easy. I didn't sweat much and my breathing wasn't that heavy. Near the end of level 1 I was starting to think this was a joke. Enter level 2. HOLY COW!!! I had to stop the DVD and rewind it a few times because I wasn't sure about the moves. The reverse plank and leg raises were the first things that got me. Oy do you see how high Basheera kicks her feet in the air? I thought I was doing that. Nope. And me being the crazy one I grab a pair of 10s when Jillian says ""grab some weights to make it harder"". Maybe 10s are a bit too hard for me right now lol. Anyway I'm excited to continue this workout :)"
3,"What's going on, Jillian?","Her past two workouts have been really disappointing to me! Killer Buns and Thighs wasn't challenging and this one is just messy. There really isn't any organization to this at all, it's almost like she just kind of made it up as she went. I've been (and still am) a fan of Jillian Michaels for so long, but lately her DVDs have been lacking. I don't think this will really get you results because it didn't really make me sore, but the circumstances could be different for you.I would try this workout if you're familiar with Jillian's style but be prepared for possible disappointment."
3,"Not a bad workout, but not great either","Typically I like Jillian's workouts because they are usually pretty tough. This one, however, not so much. She does include a few challenging moves, but the rest are recycled from other DVDs or new moves that don't really do much. The fusion aspect of it is good if you want a longer workout that doesn't challenge any body part too much, or if you want a medium workout and you have an hour to do it in. Jillian is one of the better trainers out there, but this is definitely not her strongest workout."
4,Ok,"I like Jillian's workouts and loved the 30 day shred. This video was harder to keep up with, but I'm not sure Jillian would think that was a bad thing. You could always skip around the workout to piece together something different than as is formatted- in order to mix up the workout from day to day."
5,<3 JM,I love Jillian Michael's workout and the same goes for this one. It is a great mix of cardio and strength intervals.
3,Great sound - but All rise was better,"Despite the fact that Lee voice makes every gurl cry her eyes out and Dunk's smile makes every gurl weak in the knees, the sound of All rise was better. This was just fall-into-the-back-of-the-shelf-after-a-couple-of-weex CD, while All rise's lyrics totally absorbed you in. A few good songs, (nothing to dance to that much) like One love, Flexin', U make me wanna, Supersexual, Privacy and Without you. The rest get really, really boring. All in all, a very good album, just didn't live up to my standards. Luking forward to new single, Guilty as well as new album. :) Still luv ya, Blue!!!"
1,boring!,"It's not as good as their first album 'All Rise'.The only track that stands out are 'one love' which is not up to standard as 'All Rise' and 'Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word'.If you have enough money to buy one cd,make sure you don't buy this cd!It's a complete waste of money.You will regret buying this cd."
1,Too Bad They're So Slow,I was looking for a good beginner program and thought i found it until i checked Window's compatibility. Since it's not compatible with XP it leaves a lot of people out in the cold. Also it makes me wonder why a software developer is so late in putting out an XP compatible version. They have a lot of other music related software that sounds great but they should get on the ball since it makes me go hmmmmmmmmmm.
2,Sevillanas de los bloques,"I heard ""Sevillanas de los bloques"", the BEST song in this album, back in the 80's, when I used to work at a radio station in Spain. After so many years, I wanted to get that song and I realized this album -her first- was the only way to get it. I went to Spain for Christmas and found it. I was not very sure about buying it, but when I saw that Kiko Veneno and Raimundo Amador were some of the staff that collaborated with Martirio, I quickly made up my mind and bought it. What a mistake! This album is not good at all. Sevillanas de los bloques is the only song that I like (a lot!), but the rest is not worth the price. I do not recommend this album to anyone. You may want to try other albums by Martirio, but this her first one is pointless and a waste of your time and money. I have a respect for Martirio, but again, this album is not a good one."
2,Quality is fine; it just doesn't do much,"My 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and Santa was kind enough to bring it for her. The quality is fine, but it just doesn't do much. She played with it for the first day, and has touched it maybe twice since. I've seen these on clearance everywhere I've gone lately, too. If your child is into playing ""mommy"", this is cute, but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn't really equate to lasting play value with this one."
5,First Rate,"My husband purchased this set for my 5-year old daughter and she loves it. The magnetic treasure chest is by far her favorite feature, and it is all interchangable with other my little pony figures. The whole set has gone in her special toy spot next to her bed and spent several months there! She loves to put other 'special' things in the treasure chest and let the pony 'open' it with it's foot. My daughter likes it so much I bought the same set for my 2 year old niece. Enjoy!"
4,Kaganovich: Forgotten Mass Murderer,"This book is truly amazing in that it is the first, or one of the first, biographies of one of Stalin's closest comrades. How could such a wicked mass murderer go unnoticed for so many decades? The true value of this book lies not in the author's scholarly abilities but in the largely overlooked subject matter. Hopefully many more scholarly works on Kaganovich will be forthcoming. A ""must read"" for any serious student of the Soviet Union and man's inhumanity to man."
2,No!!!,"This video is way, way outdated!!!The moves are too fast & ""jerky"", even for someone of intermediate fitness level!Ergonomically incorrect, confusing, would discourage most beginners.I love Joanie, but threw this video out!!"
2,Very disappointing revision:,"I bought the 2006 edition of this book automatically, as I have for a number of years. I am extremely disappointed with the totally revised content, as I find it much more difficult to use. While it would seem logical to group the records together as done in the new volume, it just doesn't work for me. The old layout of team info, with each team starting at the top of a page, has been junked, and the results are not pretty. Furthermore, this is now just a record book; the old ""facts"" sections, including a review of the preceding season and a preview of the new season, have disappeared. I'm keeping my 2005 edition and trashing the 2006. I hope Sporting News comes to their senses and arranges the 2007 edition like the 2005 and prior editions. ""It wasn't broke, but they 'fixed' it anyway."""
4,A meticulously researched study,"Sim's book is one of the most important books on Matthean studies and Christian Judaism since J. D. Dun's Unity and Diversity in the New Testament. The chapter on Pauline Christianity and the Matthean Community is significantly important, for Sim argues that Matthew is anti-Pauline, thus Paul's Torah-free Christianity is anathema to the Matthean Community. Furthermore, Matthew's Gospel has a number of anti-Gentile statements, which Sim concludes is a result of the Matthean Community being surrounded by a hostel Gentile environment. Gentiles wanting to join the Matthean Community first had to convert to Judaism and then undergo Nazarene indoctrination and ritualism. In short, Sim argues that the Matthean Community is totally committed to Judaism as interpreted by Jesus from Nazareth. This book raises a number of important questions, which cannot be ignored to do so is at Christianity's peril."
3,Quest for the Possible Dream,"Author Fergus Fleming studied at Oxford University and was a writer and editor at Time Life Books before he became a free lance writer. Written with a trademark wit, the book draws on logs, journals and letters to give a fascinating account of man's quest for the North Pole. Just as Mars is now-- the North Pole was a mystery for the 19th Century explorer. This book picks up where the Barrow's Boys leaves off. It introduces you to some ice-clumped lunatics and some heros and heroines of the Northern arena. Great reading for the beach in the summertime. A bit academic but that's what is so fascinating because it appears to all be true. Sleighs, balloons, dogs, ships, zepppelins -- the last frontier was open for all to conquer. Some did, most didn't but the quest is what makes it so fascinating. What they ate, how they traveled, how they lived, how they raised the money-- they were the Olympians and astronauts of an age long gone by."
2,Terrible Recording Quality,"The major work on this album is Francis Poulenc's Figure Humaine, a choral piece composed during the Nazi occupation of France. It is painful to see a work of such beauty ruined by poor sound quality. Feedback and noise are present on every crescendo, and the softer moments are hard to pick up. It's difficult to judge the singers' voices objectively in this situation, although their rhythm and diction is excellent. For such an epic work, the poor sound quality is a crippling problem. I would recommend another recording."
2,Disappointing,"As is the case with most of the Playmates characters, the Captain looks great. However, he only says one line, and only in one environment (the church). In addition, he is too big to fit in the pews with another character.I've got him off to the side of my environments. Maybe he'll work better in a future setting. A real let down."
2,So-So,"Some of this ""sparse and elegant prose"" was downright melodramatic at times. Lots of telling. Not much showing. I have to say though, I saw it through to the end because a momentum definitely built throughout - I knew ""something"" was going to happen so that kept me reading. The last three chapters were the best. Overall, I would recommend it, but not highly. The book itself is beautiful: gorgeous cover and color scheme; nice size."
1,"Sometimes ""Bad"" is bad.","This is one bad product. Backed up by bad support.It comes in the box with the Turtlebeach AudioTron (which is a GREAT product) and I've tried using it in each of four different incarnations. The latest version adds a bunch of flashy things, but the basic problem remains the same.The reason I give only 1 start is that the product crashes while playing songs and makes a LOUD screaching noise repetitively until you manage to kill the program. It does this on every machine I have tried it on (about 10 different types of hardware). Other programs, and the AudioTron, play the songs fine.It has done this in each and every PAID upgrade I have tried. Customer support has either told me it is my hardware or they ignore me completely.If they would fix it and give updates to their current customers I would re-consider my rating. I like the User Interface (much better than MediaPlayer and/or iTunes), but if it doesn't work it DOESN'T WORK."
1,What Would it Matter?,It's like arguing the point of the sexual orientation of staphylococcus aureus: a digression from its primary import. Likewise was Hitler's meatless and alcohol free diet. To investigate the behavioral incidentals of a monster trivializes its monstrousness and can only make it appear not quite so monstrous. Preventing the recurrence of such a monster is paramount and is not served by examining what was not so monstrous.
4,"Wow, what a guy can do with words","A lot of people have been talking about this book, so I had to check it out and now I realize why. William James Austin takes you to places that you'd never think of or want to go to. He caters to that voyeur in all of us. Basically, the man makes us feel dirty and like it. When reading this book there were so many moments that I felt like I was in the scene he created. It made me want to go back to traveling New York City's streets. And I never thought I'd like poetry!!!!!!"
2,Hijaak Digital Photo Studio Express CD software.,Got the CD in time to try but there was no serial or activation number to install the software. It was a useless product. Now I am still can't use the product.
3,Not Bad!,"This movie was OK. It has it's moments were its funny and were it's corny. Slammed has a lot of faces people seen on TV and movies. so you can say it has a good cast of faces in acting, for a B-movie. Sasha Mitchell was the reason I got the movie He was cool in (step by step and in the Kickboxer movies)he looks in top shape in this movie. The women in the movieall look hot as hell from the playboy models to the girl from the VIP TV show. The acting is not all that good, but he movie is all right."
5,2008 Tahoe,"Best bang for the buck. Best price anywhere. Truck ran good before, but now, even better. Smooth power, truck flies combined with flowmaster mufflers and Pulstar Spark plugs."
2,A desk reference.,"I found this book, and the companion piece Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money and Investing, practically worthless. I have heard raves about this book's presentation. I think the presentation is far too simplistic. This book did not hold my attention one bit and I quickly put it down. If you are looking for a mature introduction to the Market and or Personal finance I recommend you keep looking past these two books."
1,A VERY CURSORY REVIEW OF THE SUBJECT,"If you know anything about loans, checking accounts, buying a home or mutual funds don't buy this book. The title should be: ""Don't Buy This Book and Save Some Personal Finances!"""
1,Daddy is a deadbeat.,"This book would be really wonderful for kids who are going through a divorce where their daddy is a louse. The book portrays the father as a deadbeat who doesn't bother to show up for visitations even though he only has them one night a week. What does this book say that a divorce is? ""A divorce meant that Daddy would not live with Mama, Ruth, and Dinah anymore.""I know how impressionable kids are, how is this supposed to be an unbiassed view of divorce? In my mind this book is designed to taint the mind of impressionable children to make them wonder whether their daddy was going to treat them with the same carelessness as Daddy Bear. I would warn fathers who find themselves in a divorce to think carefully before allowing their children to read this book."
4,Explaining Divorce to toddlers,"I've read this book several times to myself but can barely get through it without crying so I'm NOT ready to read it to my 3 1/2 y/o twins. I think I'll be ready soon. Then there's the thought of (if they don't know about what marriage/divorce means, why explain it now? The book seems really good for this purpose, I'm still on the fence personally. It was a great transaction though."
5,Excellent Excellent Book for toddlers,"I bought this book for my two yr old while going through a separation. He says ""mom, I sad."" I read him this book on the situaiton at hand & it is right to the point & simple for toddlers to understand. Its about a bear family and no matter where daddy is or mama is, they always love you. No matter that there are two houses now, mama & daddy still think about you. AND in no way is this separation the childs fault. Its a MUST read for parents separating with small children. Believe me, they know things are different, they don't know the details, but reading this book will help them understand that everything will be ok among all the chaos in thier lives now. a MUST buy."
1,Words fail me,"What was I thinking when I picked this one up? What were they thinking when they made this? What are you thinking reading a review of this piece of crap? Run, and forget you ever heard of this movie. Horrible script (I guess they had a script), bad acting, laughable special effects and music that was probably from the cutting room floor of 'The Exorcist.' I don't know what to say about this film. It was just bad. Don't watch it. There is no excuse for a film this bad. Even if you're into mindless violence or gore or gratuitous nudity..Pass on this. There is none. There is some fake blood to be sure, but you never actually see what happens. There was one good thing though. I was kind of happy when that annoying Professor Esterbrook got killed. Man, she was abnoxious. Okay, I'm done beating on this sick dog. I say, move on and find something else to watch. Anything. Stare at a blank TV screen for an hour and a half."
4,Hooked again!,"OK, so I am hooked on the Alice Nestleton mysteries! This must be the fifth or sixth I have read, and I can't get enough! Alice, who has a lot of free time on her hands, being as she is unemployed, sets out to solve a murder which she practically witnessed. She is certainly a suspect. I like the stories like this one that take place in NYC. The murderer was a big surprise in this one! Another quick and enjoyable read!"
2,Alexander becomes a man.,"Alexander at 14 (Larry Simms) is reading a Romantic Life magazine and boy is he getting an education.

He even shaves for the first time.There is a new delivery man that has yet to meet Dagwood. As soon as the man comes up to the Bumstead house with glee and offers a fine shake...you guessed it.

2,Not thrilled,"I tried two quick bread recipes - Rhubarb Oatmeal Bread, pg 157, and Chocolate Chip Banana, pg 132. Good taste but both recipes created loaves with fallen centers. I tried both recipes 2-3 times with different flours, temps and got the same result. I am getting frustrated since my goal was to create gift breads but I can not give these because of their appearance.I also tried the Greek Lemon Bread, pg 251 - it was OK, a little sweet for my taste. I did not have a problem with a sunken center with this bread.Also, there is absolutely no help in troubleshooting problems. I expect more from a cook who trained at the Cordon Bleu, at least recipes that turn out. I am disappointed."
5,Klein Makes the Best,This merely a tweaking of an already perfect tool as Klein continues to upgrade its tools. This is perfect for electrical an telecommunications work. Great Tool
4,"DIFFERENT, BUT GLADYS KNIGHT","Being a fan of Gladys since 70 years, I must to say that I didn't like this CD when I heard it for the first time. Everything seemed strange to me: the songs, that repeated electronics beating, doing all the songs seem like, and even the Gladys' voice (compressed, insecure...?). Then, I've heard it over and over again. Now I already can tell about my preferences on the CD: ""Do you really want to know"", ""I said you lied""(where Gladys recalls ""Neither One Of Us"" in a musical phrase), ""Love Hurts"", ""I wanna be loved""(where Jamie Foxx seems to shrink, frightend, before the goddess presence!), ""Please help me I'm falling"". The re-edited version of the powerful ""End of the road medley, live"" was unnecessary: who likes Gladys Knight has the obligation to have the amazing whole track at home and who that don't know her, won't feel the emotion provoked only for the entire track... But,at last, it's Gladys Knight! Let's hear and have fun! (But she is so different...!)"
4,"Gladys, Welcome Back!","This is not an album for everyone! You need to be in the mood to take an honest look at love and relationships to get with this and that's fine. There are few compelling melodies here to distinguish many of the ballads from eachother but it's the lyrics that are the focus. Gladys is simply singing what many of us have a hard time saying to the guy or woman we love. ""What are going to do to keep me? ""Do you understand and accept me for who I am?"" ""Why do I keep coming back to you."" What is so refreshing about this project is that it's not about the player-hater mentality trap so many artists today fall into. Even people who don't cheat on eachother have problems. As always, Gladys is in great vocal form. I was also moved by the inspirational quotes that she included for all the songs. If you feel you're at the crossroads in a relationship with someone, this is the platter to spin and listen to together. Peace and ""Better Love Next Time."""
1,Laura Hillenbrand's book is much better,"Stick with the original story. Hollywood screwed this one up. Key characters were omitted and important facts were messed up. If you didn't read the original story, you wouldn't know that, and you can enjoy the movie for what it is. However, if you're going to take the time to read a book, get your facts straight with the original book by Laura Hillenbrand which is the best non-fiction book I've ever read."
3,Flat laptop cooler,"This is the second one I have purchased. I do not like the fact it is flat and not ajustable but my wife loves it. It, like anything else, will break down and you will need to be able to fix it your self or just buy another one like I did. For the money , you can't complain.StarTech.com USB Powered Laptop Cooler - Black (NBCOOLER)"
4,Pretty Satisfied,"After reading other reviews I knew figuring out how to use it properly would be the biggest challenge. Once you know how to use it, it's easy to use and fast. I typically run it over my baby's head 2-3 times to get a good estimate but it's still easier than trying to get a rectal temp, ear temp (she has tiny, tiny ears) or under arm temp. I'd recommend this. They use the same one at the doc's office so that seems like a vote of confidence as well."
1,Exergen,Until now and after 2 months I have not received the product and have not received a answer to my enuire about that I have not received the thermometer. I am waiting an answer from the seller without success. I want my money back
1,Costs $30 more than you think,"Purchased this with a $5 mail in rebate. The rebate check bounced, so I'm out the $5 plus a $25 returned check fee. I suggest passing on this item and buying something from a real company."
5,Easy and Accurate,Bought this thermometer after I had so many problems with the ear thermometer.This is so easy to use and accurate. You don't need any disposable covers. The battery is included. Comes with easy to read/follow instructions.You do not need to wake up any child to take their temperature. You don't have to press hard for a read. You just gently swipe it across the forehead to the temple area. It's fast easy and accurate.
5,The best thermometer I've ever tried,"I buy thermometers regularly because they get lost in the house and I often end up hating the new ones I buy. I bought this thermometer at the drugstore in May for almost a hundred dollars! It's shocking to see the huge price drop. Regardless, it's worth it. It's accurate and consistent. The thermometers that take the temperature in your ear constantly change their reading. This is not the case here. To test accuracy, I checked my temperature even when healthy and compared it to the good old-fashioned thermometers that just take longer to give a read out than I prefer."
4,Temporal Thermometer,"Working as a paramedic and dealing with patients in less than stellar conditions I have come to appreciate the ease and ""relative"" accuracy of a temporal thermometer. No it is not as accurate as a rectal temp, but if you use them enough you get used to the variation versus rectal. Most people are only using it to get a good idea, not an exact number, and this gives you just that. Compared to the tympanic - this is light years ahead and much more consistent. Before purchasing I read a review from a ""Med Student"" who blasted it. Obviously he hasn't spent any time in a hospital where they are using them on nearly every patient that comes in the door. If it comes up with a reading that is febrile or hypothermic - then they do a rectal/core temperature. Whether you are at home or in the back of my ambulance - this is a great product for the price."
5,The best gift for new parents,I was really hesitant to take my newborn's temperature rectally. We had gotten the in-the-ear thermometer as a gift but were told by our pediatrician that you can't use this on newborns. My husband found this and I have to say it was the best investment we ever made--it's very accurate and totally non-invasive. The best part is that you can take your child's temperature while they are sleeping. I would totally recommend this as a gift for parents of newborns.
3,"Fine, but won't replace a standard thermometer.","This seems to be better for quick checks of a baby's temperature rather than a real replacement for a standard digital thermometer. It is difficult to hold it even with the forehead surface, and frequently gives me different, or very low, readings regardless of how I use it, or which instructions I follow. I ended up buying a small digital rectal thermometer for use when I *really* need to know the temperature, which makes this a pretty expensive gimmick.I decided to keep mine, but I wouldn't buy it again. Maybe the next generation will be better.Sean P. Logue, 2008"
1,Worthless Garbadge,"I have read the directions multiple times and have attempted to take the temperature of multiple people many many times. First, you never get remotely the same temperature reading twice. Also, it seems to always read lower than the actual temperature. I really don't understand how anyone can get a reliable reading from this device. Perhaps mine is defective???Anyway, I will stick to my Braun Thermoscan ear thermometer, which is the most accurate thermometer that I've come across. This worthless thing will go in the garbage."
1,Junk...,"I'm pretty annoyed because I didn't realize it wasn't working right until now and I've had it a couple years. Thankfully, my family hasn't had any high fevers, so it really hasn't been needed. I most recently tried using it to chart my bbt, since it reads in .1 increments. I can't even get it to give the same reading twice. It's ridiculous. Do not buy, unless you like throwing your money away."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought this and I am telling you it is a waste of money, do not buy it. It does not give an accurate reading. I took my daughter to the doctor along with this and asked them about it, they told me, it's useless."
1,Don't throw away the rectal thermometer,My 16 month old little boy suffers from febrile seizures which means I take a thermometer very seriously. Recently he had a seizure and we checked his temperature using this thermometer and it showed to be normal. I panicked because my child doesn't have these seizures without a fever involved. I double checked with a rectal thermometer and it showed to be a WHOPPING 5 degrees higher confirming that my son did indeed have a fever. His body was burning up and I am so shocked that this thermometer didn't show his true temperature. I was always suspicious because it always seemed to vary and now I know my suspicions were correct. I may (very small may) try this thermometer again when my baby is older but for now I'm sticking with tried and true.
1,not accurate readings,"As a nurse and a mother to four little children, I decided to give the temporal a try...opposed to using rectal or oral.....and i was extremely disappointed. first, the readings were off many times! this is a potential hazard. so once i put it back into the closet after using it for several months with no luck....it fell on the ground from the first shelf and fell apart into pieces! not reliable in either way. no recommended."
2,Inconsistent Readings,"Maybe I have a lemon. But if not, I cannot stand this thermometer. Contact on the forehead has to be just right; yet even with good contact I swear it just reads wrong."
3,Works well...now fix it!,"By all accounts this should be a five star review. The temporal thermometer gives a consistent temp measurement, is almost instant, and is non-invasive. But I'm dropping two stars for two issues. First, and biggest...no back-light! It's 3am, my baby has a fever, I do not want to turn on a light in that nursery. A back-light would make this readable in any situation. Secondly, I wish there were a way to turn off the beeping.I love the product, but it needs the back-light improvement."
5,Great product,This makes it much easier to take the baby's temperature. Very difficult to insert an ear thermometer into a screaming baby's ear. Definitely would recommend.
1,Cheap thin mailers.,No name brand. Not very good quality. Thin and rip easily. I cannot recommend this product. Looking for a better product.
4,Tsunami Bomb at their best,When I heard this cd was going to come out I couldn't wait (having heard all of Tsunami Bombs previous albums)and once it did I was blown away. The song Take the Reins is absolutely amazing the beat the lyrics I don't all I do know is its great. Russian Roulette had an unusual beat but once again I fell in love with the song.I could just go on for hours and hours about how great this band and the rest of the songs on the cd are. but I won't you judge for yourself.
5,Other Bands you might like,"I love this band, and if you haven't heard of ""The Guano Apes"", or ""Blend Engine"" check those two bands out. Two more female fronted bands that will blow your mind away. Blend Engine needs more recognition if you ask me. If you want to just check them out and listen to them they have two download-able songs on their site www.Blendengine.com! ""All the Pretty Pennies"" is a great song, and if you can find it somewhere ""Hit the Silk"" is a great song. Cheers!-Christina:-D :-("
5,The Mystery of Lourdes,"Very beautiful book. Was in excellent shape when it arrived. The material covered in this book is both inspiring and true as the facts are available from other documents and archives(and research of more recent years). Testimonies on the actions of war heros' who had been cured at Lourdes are unforgetable. I especially wanted the 1950's edition because it contains descriptions of earlier miraculous healings, that for some reason the daughter in later editions chose to edit out.The writing by the original author is better. The original copy is simply superior in every way.I'm sorry the daughter in the 1980's editions felt the need to alter the mother's beautifully crafted masterpiece."
3,Gets Better With Age,This is not the worst Christmas collection EVER!The saddest of the bunch is the Cheedh&Chong; selection. This is the worst!I have edited my first scathing review.Second thought:This record gets better if you skip the Cheedh&Chong; selection. I have decided to raise its grade to a C+ or three stars.Could I have overreacted when I did the original review?
1,Pathetic,"Which is sadder? That this collection of trite, superficial, simplistic series of Sermons is popular with some people.... Or that Millman writes this kind of meaningless tripe. ""It is nice to be nice and meet nice people, life is a classroom and every day is a lesson!"" If one is so intellectually and emotionally unformed that this passes for life advice, then there really is little hope of redemption for the suffering and turmoil in our world and in people's lives. There ARE answers--Millman has none of them, and has no inner experience on which to draw. A true false prophet."
3,This is a FIXED FOCUS CAMERA,"Although this camera is pretty good at taking pictures, many websites including Visioneer's own site and Tiger Direct claim this is an autofocus camera. BEWARE. It is a fixed focus lens unit, like the disposable types you buy in drug stores.We have also had some problems connecting the LX200 to the USB port, but I suspect these can be solved by minor software changes.The view screen is somewhat washed out looking.It has many good features, BUT NO AUTOFOCUS (like Amazon.com says)."
3,good product.,"good product, binding was different than specified. good seller. my only gripe is the that the product was bound with black plastic ring binding."
4,Great for 1 time use only,"This is a great thermometer, but once you take it off the glass, you can't put it back on and use it again. I know it's probably designed that way because it's so cheap, but I would have liked something a little more permanent than 1 time use out of it."
1,couldn't get mine to work,I bought this writer with a lot of anticipation. When I installed it( not difficult)everything seemed fine but I could never get it to burn a cd. The unit would go through every step and when it finally came time to burn all I got was a message saying the burn had failed at whatever speed I had set it to burn at. I went to their Tech dept. which required a call back some 4 to 5 hours later. After doing what they suggested ( Downloading updated burn software )I still got the same results. I then carried the unit to my office where our resident wiz did everything he could-same result. I ended up returning the burner and got a slower albeit more reliable HP. It was fine from the moment it was installed. I'm sure I must have gotten a defective unit but for someone who is not into computers and only wanted a way of compiling cds it was simply frustrating.
3,Great product- Tiny bottle,"I stand behind oil of oregano 100% but don't be shocked when you receive the bottle- it is very small. Maybe because the contents are very powerful? The caspsules are tiny. I am used to big supplement capsules. If you are worried, compare the dosage on the back with other products."
3,"Good, but quirky","A good product, but a difficult install, and very sensitive to placement on a surface which isn't perfectly flat (like my boat's instrument panel / dashboard). I suspect that the slight bend in my dashboard makes closing the cover a bit difficult, since it's slightly deformed by the curvature of the dash (and yes, I've not tightened the screws very much). Could use better documentation, including a good installation template. Unlike me, you might want to install the foam water-insulating backing to the back of the cover, rather than to the dash. Seems to protect my Kenwood marine stereo very well."
4,Rock & Roll with a sprinkling of R&B,"I, too, wore out three different cassettes of this album. The import I have includes 5 bonus tracks of live cuts from this album. (Including a surprise cover song!) Standouts are the rocking ""Don't Stop"" ""Private Life"" & ""Ten Feet Tall"" and the great ballad ""Letting It Out"". This album will make you smile."
4,Tug at the Heart,"This is a lovely book to share with a young child. It is beautifully illustrated with soft colored scenes of child and Teddy. It is sure to be that book your child will always remember having it read to them ... well that is once Mommy stops crying.Patti, Author & Mommy"
4,"good for the parents, but not for the kids",I think this book is actually very cute. But it is more interesting for the parents.The illustration are not bright enough to get kid's attention and content doesn't really make sense for at least a toddler. When moms read this book-they can get very emotional (including a dad). I still wouldn't call this a kids' book.
3,WARNING!!!,"I love this brand and type of plant for my aquarium. Our local pet store only carries the small and medium, so when I found the large online - I ordered immediatly. They are the best and I will continue to purchase this brand.However, with in 2 hrs of having the plants in the tank our pleco became entangled in the grass like plant (it is made poorly and left with jagged edges) and cut up his fins very badly. The wider leaf plant is perfect though."
3,Good for many. Laughs,"Very lite, easy to watch comedy series. We laugh from start to finish and recognize many of our friends in the characters.."
3,The Widows Resource,Probably should be re-named 'The Widows Resource If You've Been Left With A Lot Of Money And Don't Know What To Do With It'....I was hoping to find information on how to handle the loss of ones major source of income without becoming a bag lady......this is definately not the book for that. A good book though if you actually have money to worry about.
4,Good stuff,I bought a recording device from the Apple store but I wasn't happy with it. This unit installed easily and seems to work fine so far.
3,"great photos, and lists. Little substance.","This a great guide to getting everything you need to do a job. The photos are great for ideas, but there is little more than that. The book seems too short to accomplish the task at hand. I'll have to get an additional book."
3,Sweet Little Book,"I think this is a charming & nicely done book by my wonderful friend & author, Heidi. I'm glad she could follow a dream and put this together with Kyston. Great work, ladies!"
3,LIKE BATTERIES?,"THIS DOES GIVE NICE BRIGHT LIGHT but the bottom is hard to unscrew You have to to put all those batteries in it 8D BATTERIES AND be careful when it won't light. You have to find the bad battery. Maybe it's only 1 but you replace them all. The handle has tendency to fall off but if your careful, it sure will light up the night. If it were not for the batteries, 4 stars. and where do you find the light bulbs?"
5,Necessary item,With all the bad weather everyone should have more than a flashlight. This is perfect to have when the lights go out and you need your hands free.
4,Easy read.,Enjoying it. A little slow start but getting better. Sonny lived a tough life. Gives a good indication of life in LA.
3,A GOOD BOOK ONLY IF YOU LIKE ROMANCE NOVELS,"I READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST A MONTH AGO. YOU SHOULD PURCHASE KAYLA PERRIN'S BOOK ONLY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A ROMANCE NOVEL. I RATED THIS BOOK WITH THREE STARS ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT VERY EXCITING AND ALSO DUE TO THE ERRORS. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A VERY INTELLIGENT AND HUMBLE YOUNG WOMAN. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE SEEKING A BOOK TO KEEP YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE AND MORE, THEN CHECK OUT ""THE UPPER ROOM"" BY MARY MONROE. SHE IS THE BEST FICTIONAL WRITER SINCE ALICE WALKER'S ""COLOR PURPLE"" WRITTEN IN 1985. ADDITIONALLY, KAYLA NEEDS A BETTER EDITORIAL TEAM, BECAUSE THE ERRORS ALMOST TOOK AWAY MY INTEREST FROM ""IF YOU WANT ME""."
3,"little boy loves it, but it wore out too quickly","My son loved this gift! Unfortunately, after just 5 days, the main ear no longer will play music. We changed the batteries out, but still just one of the ears works. He loved the ear that played music and he doesn't understand why it doesn't work any more (he is 20 months old)."
4,Why do kids do what they do?,"As you probably already know , this not a part of the Tess Monaghan series and it stands very easily by itself. Ms. Lippman has done an excellent job of developing both of her main characters. The girl's personalities ring true. The psychological motivations behind the drama are well thought out and multi layered. It was not the page turner I was hoping for but an EXCELLENT READ no the less."
1,Disappointing,"JenI was very disappointed in this book. I had read another Lippman book that I thought was good, so was expecting more from this one. It was painstakingly long. She seems to want to give absurdly long back stories, side stories, adjacent stories, before ever moving the plot along. I read on a Kindle so I can't say what page I was on, but it was not until the last 5% of the book that things finally started moving along. I would say about at least 3/4 of the book wasn't needed. She attempted to try to lead you down one path so you would be shocked when she revealed the ""true"" perpetrator. And I guess I sort of was, but then everything she said to trick you seemed pointless. She attempts to wrap that up in a scene at a cemetery, but it just left me thinking ""What? That's it? What was the point of that?"". I wouldn't recommend this book. It's not worth the time you could be spending reading something else."
3,"A fun, pass-the-time book, but kind of predictable.","The book kept my interest enough, but kind of predictable outcome. The author did a good job of depicting her troubled teen-age characters - they seemed the most true-to-life as you discovered what was going through their minds as they tried to figure out the predicament they were in. All the ""secret phone calls"" were a bit over the top and not-so-true to life. Kept my interest for the most part."
2,Disappointed Lippman fan,"I usually love Lippman's books but have to say that I was disappointed Every Secret Thing. The first part moves fairly quickly but the last half slows to a maddening crawl. After awhile you start to get this ""who cares?"" attitude b/c there are no characters you can really get invested in. Too many other good books out there to try to slog your way thru this one."
4,Enjoyable...,"This one I really liked. There was good detail about the characters, and the goings on around them. I look forward to reading more books by Laura Lippman."
4,"Started, never finished.","I read a couple chapters, then haven't seen it since. I'm sure it's got dust on it, but the quality of the product leads me to believe it is still there somewhere... in pretty good shape with no bends or penmarks... (got some markers and pens too, didn't ever use them though. floating in some other existence... just sitting there... waiting..."
3,"Good, but not what I thought it was.","I missed the whole part about it being excerpts. By reading the track listings, I was under the impression that this was a CD with many different variations of the processionals, recessionals, etc. I was disappointed, as this was not a CD that I could actually use. I'd already heard all of the songs before, and was only looking for a decent version of the songs I'll be using in the wedding. HOWEVER, the CD is great for someone who has no clue what the different songs are."
3,Nothing to set it apart,"About: Couple has creepy encounters with a creepy old housePros: Steady pace, good characters, nice setting (the creepy house is like a character all its own)Cons: A decent haunted house story, but does not do much to separate itself from other haunted house stories."
1,The unscientific basis of Child Custody Decisions,"After carefully studying this book - and hundreds of similair books and journal articles - my verdict is simply that there isn't ANY scientific basis for why mental health professionals should offer their opinion in court regarding custody arrangements. The book it self is the best evidence for the lack of a scientific - and hence ethical - basis for this kind of work, and it's obvious after reading this book that most of the authors just stubbornly clung to the idea that their education, credentials and clinical intuition give them priviliged access to the minds and motivations of others. This book should be - critically - read by every lawyer and judge dealing with custody cases to prevent more havock these ""emperors without clothes"" are wrecking in the lives of thousands of lives."
3,Missing Freddy,"Heartbreaking story, more effectively portrayed in the original version. He was a good man and a powerful musician...still sorely missed by all who knew him and many who did not.This version does not include as much of his music as the original which, unfortunately, is no longer in print."
2,"Serviceable, But I'm Taking It Back","It is what it is: a low-cost keyboard. The problem for me, and the reason I'm taking it back, is because the grooves that allow you to find the home row keys are in the wrong place: on the ""F"" and ""H"" keys rather than ""F"" and ""J."" On the box they are in the correct place, so I'm assuming this is a mistake. Still, the lack of quality control is frustrating."
4,A very good cookbook.,"This is a very good cookbook, but I think I like the first one better. ""Eat This!"" the original, was more practical and is one cookbook I have used more than any other I own. Dom does have quite a habit of hampering his cookbooks with more than a little name-dropping. (i.e. You hear of all the stars who have eaten his food, but you rarely find out what they liked about it.) But the two ""Eat This!"" books are well worth the money."
4,"Great toy, but use caution...","First of all, I bought this toy yesterday for regular price at Toys R Us and it was half the price its listed here (44.99 at Toys R Us). My Five year old daughter looooves Littlest Pets and its a great set of toys to collect if, like me, you are trying to avoid Bratz or Barbies for your daughter. We love every part of the collection and play with them everyday. However, We would not own ANY of these toys if we had a baby/toddler in the house. These toys come with many very small pieces, and any child young enough to play with this toy probably isn't old enough to keep little pieces put away all of the time. Great product line, but not recommended for houses with babies!"
3,Pigeons Are Valuable Assets.,"The origins of the modern-day racing pigeon can be traced thousands of years. There were records and carvings of Rock Doves dating from 3,000 B.C. Even Noah took aboard his Ark two doves. They are the ancestors of today's pigeons, the lovely, bright gentle birds.Throughout history, the pigeon had been used by Asian And European civilizations as a speedy and reliable carrier of messages. They were used during the war by the British.When the first marathon runner gained victory in the Olympic Games at Pisa in AD230, he sent the new home via his hen bired (a pigeon), which he had taken with him. This book is illustrated throughout and the subject of training pigeons, both yound and old, is explained in depth."
4,So far so good,"I bought this scanner after returning a higher end flatbed scanner that was not sending enough light through the 35 mm slides I was scanning. This scanner does a good job and allows me to brighten up most all of the darker or poorly taken slides.The software is fairly easy to use although I would like to see an automatic program to clean up imperfections as the manual program takes quite a bit of time and work. The scanner does tend to slow down after completing about 100 slides at one sitting, but has continued to work fine"
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased an Oregon Scientic WR 103 and was very disappointed with the quality of this product. It's supposed to have a feature called ""non-volatile memmory back up."" When the first storm that came through after purchase, I was excited to see it work. It got the NWS alert signal, turned itself on, and broadcast the alert. OK its working just fine, I thought. Then came the first nearby lightning strike. Instantly the radio lost all power and memory, including the NOAA channel and county codes. No other appliances in my home were affected. I called Oregon Scientific; customer service said that it was defective and should be replaced.Amazon did a great job handling the return and providing service. I received a replacement a few days later. I programmed the new one and used if for ten minutes. In the first ten minutes the Oregon Scientific radio lost all memory three times. I don't want to have to depend on this usit in a storm."
2,don't use too much muscle,"bought these to wall mount my control speakers. the ring that tightens around the ball (look at the pictures to see what I'm referring to) has metal inserts, but the ring itself is plastic. I tightened the ring by hand and then used the included metal piece to get some leverage to tighten it a bit more. The plastic ring cracked on two of the five wall brackets. Those brackets are still usable, but not like they should be. Don't use too much muscle tightening with the metal piece..."
1,Disappointing Delusions,"Although I have no doubt that Castaneda under the influence of multiple mind altering drugs believed his experiences to be of great import to occult science, Thomas Vaughan summed the such likes in saying, The spirals of their towers of Babel seem to ascend to the clouds, but when a foundation in Light of Truth is sought; there is none to be found.It serves no purpose than to take up time and research; except to perceive just how far God will permit a man to delude himself via demonic influence.Matthew P. DecFounder - asrpcp.org"
5,Captured Our Hearts,Our family squabbled over who was reading next when we borrowed the hardcover edition from the local library. We each became completely immersed in these mountains as Scott's vivid and descriptive writing drew us in. For the casual outdoors person who wants to learn more about the flora and fauna along the trail; for the naturalist who reads and nods in agreement with the text; for who appreciates the natural history of this region; this is the book to add to the top of the reading list. And you might want to buy two copies! Leave one at home. Put the second in the backpack for field notes.
3,blurry indoor pictures,"The price is great, the camera small, but if you want indoor pictures, you'll have to expect that half of them will be blurry.I'm pretty disappointed with the flash --and I've tried all of the settings. I wrote to Fuji and they said 'use a tripod.'Outdoor pictures, downloads, processor speed--all great. But I'll get a bigger diameter lens on my next camera."
1,Obviously an early effort.....,"This book is no where near as good as her other books. There is so much rambling, that I skipped many pages and didn't miss a thing! I cannot recommend this book... The author spends so much time setting up the feelings of the characters, that she almost forgets to add a plot! The hero has a Scottish accent, which is never explained.... he is a US citizen, from an orphanage, and this makes no sense to me (although, to be honest, perhaps I missed this point when trying to find an interesting, well written passage!).... don't waste your time on this one... or if you must read it, check it out of the library, like I did... and save the money for something better..."
1,Unreadable,"I found this book to be virtually unreadable. I gave up trying after a couple chapters. The message seems to be 'love yourself', but the prose is so circular and long-winded as to leave one wondering what one has just read."
4,The One,Interesting read and lots of food for thought. I especially liked the prayers at the end of each chapter or segment. Would have given the book a five except for the fact that I'd have enjoyed more depth and examples.
5,Lavishly illustrated history of the american trotting horse,"This is an informative, lavishly illustrated book with dozens of black and white lithographs of trotting horses circa 1820-1900, as well as prints of famous trotters from the same era. The author details the origins of the american trotting horse, discusses the appeal of trotting horses in the victorian era, and tells stories of popular trotting champions, including Lady Suffolk, Hambletonian, Flora Temple, Dexter, and others. I highly recommend this book to those who have an interest in trotting races in general, and also to those who simply enjoy seeing the slice of life the book provides through its impressive pictoral gallery."
5,Passionate Presence,"I received the book in good condition and within a reasonable time from the date of ordering. Thank you! Sister Rachel Doerfler,C.S.A."
1,Unclear and of minor usefulness,"An occasionally mildly interesting series of anecdotes and little musings on life. The musings are not particularly original and are somewhat repressive in tone. There is not much literary merit, either. The writing is adequate journalistic writing as you would find in any newspaper, but no more than that. Also, it's never made clear what awakened awareness is and how it differs from unawakened awareness, or how we go about getting awakened awareness. Clarity on this point should have been a minimum requirement, I would've thought! Also, why are there 7 qualities of awakened awareness? Why not 8, 9 or 10? The designation 7 seems to be purely arbitrary. What about the quality of humour, for example?...If you are truly interested in genuine awakening in a more democratic ""no teacher, no student"" context there are other much better, much clearer and much worthier books out there. Try Jan Kersschot's books, for example."
1,Kills fishes but clears water,"I bought 2 filters for my 10 gallon tanks with Platy fishes. It was very cloudy before. After using the filter for 5 days water turned crystal clear!!! but now I notice that my fishes are loosing weight (big head, small trunk)and hiding in corners and I already lost 12 fishes and few are still sick.....I tried medications for fungus and parasites, with no effect so far. Another tank with no filter, fishes are fine. I remember that long time back I bought few sponges from dollar store for undergravel filter (home made!), next day morning all my gold fishes died. Should I remove the filter??....I am lost"
4,Magical Fun,"Louisa caught my sympathy, reading as how her stepmum evil Minty, and stepbro treated her. Her best friend, Frenchy - tall, lanky and who wears spectacles - tried to cheer her up whenever she was down in the dumps. My favourite part was when Lulu discovered Cassandra, the mysterious and seemingly magical woman. Cassandra has all the ingredients that are required to bake The Truth Cookies. The ending was hilarious and I cannot wait to read the book after this, Cupid Cakes. Anyhow, The Truth Cookie has a marvellous magical theme that caught my interest and I certainly have not regretted buying it."
5,HUEY... CAN STILL BLOW THOSE PIPES !,"GREAT SELLER, DEPENDABLE DISSCRIPTION, AND DO RECOMMEND THIS CDTO THOSE ROCK-N-ROLLRE'S OUT THERE, FOR SOME GREAT MUSIC AND NOTTHE RAP JUNK THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND ! AAAAA+++"
4,Amazing Book On Moufang Polygons,"This book is heads and shoulders above all the other books on Moufang polygons. I'm certain that the critical acclaim that this book is winning in Moufang circles (of people, not the study of generalized geometrical circles in projective polar coordinates), is really going to shake things up among geometers whose careers revolve around topics they've pioneered and in some cases invented. People who study Moufang trees are now obsolete ! And if the authors read this, will they send me a signed copy of their book ?"
1,Sittin on the Front Pew,"It took all I had to finish this book. I really got tired of the funeral planning and the bickering of the daughters. There were some funny moments but this book still left me with sour thoughts of the author for writing this junk. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and I am hoping that the author will find a more interesting subject next time. However, I won't know one way or the other. (I'm done with their writing)"
1,sitting in the front pew,After reading this book it was so boring it was plain stupid for a man to be a pillar of the community and to have raised 4 self absorbed vain petty and narrow minded professional so called educated daughters that were greedy and selfish it seems to me that he was not a quote unquote good man what did he teach his daughters I was so disappointed in the book and in the author that I wasted my money on this book it was such a letdown also to keep his oldest daughter a secret it was just damn stupid and he was a coward for harboring a secret like that it speaks volumes about his character
4,Great Book,Great book. Love the way the story unfolded. Could personally relate to so much of the story. I laughed and cried throughout the whole book.
5,The tears will flow with this one!,"This was wonderful, heart wrenching novel that remidns us all to appreciate those in our lives while they are here. A wonderful since of family...since we as African American are always deplicted as products of broken homes this book reveals not only family togetherness but that ""We to"" want higher educations for our children and we can be sucessful!!!!not stars of the 11 o'clock news."
4,It Made Me Cry,"I just got finished reading ""Sittin' In The Front Pew"" and it broke my heart literally. As I read the book I thought I was reading about me, my father and my sister that I just found out I had in 2002, but it didn't take my father dying for me to find out, he just called me and told me, because she tried to contact him.This book was so touching and true to life. Even though I never lost anyone that close to me, it made me feel that this is what people really go through when they lose a love one, especially one they hold a torch for.I took a star off for Ms. Parry's reference to people acting like they were raised in the projects. Which way is that, I would like to know? I was raised in the projects and was raised very well. You can be raised in the suburbs, inside a house with a fence and still have not home-training, its not the surrounding its the parent, whether it be one or two in the household.Later!!!!!"
2,Item quality and vendor's customer service unsatisfactory,"The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him.BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit."
1,It will probably will not fit your cabinet,I bought it. It designed for doors that do not close on a frame. This means - it not relevant for most doors I know. In other words - not a standard dimension.
1,Not worth the price...,"I received this product for Christmas and was at first impressed, the overall make of the joystick is sturdy and ergonomic (though it wasn't really ergonomic for me, because I'm left-handed). Unfortunately, it was oversensitive, even when I went into Logitech's software to lower sensitivity.I could have lived with the sensitivity, since there are several third-party programs that help with Logitech's sensitivity and calibration, like DXTweak2. The only problem was that whenever I rebooted my computer the settings wouldn't register on the stick upon next play. So basically I could get my settings perfect for the game I'm playing but then as soon as I shut down the computer the next day I'd have to figure out those settings again. It was just way too much of a hassle.Fed up, I ended up returning it to Comp USA and traded it in for a Saitek Cyborg Evo, which is about $30 cheaper then this stick and handles much better."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this toy for my Goddaughters, ages 9 and 7. It seemed pretty impressive with everything it contained. But, the loom broke immediately, we were never able to use it, and I believe the crochet hooks and knitting needles are way too small to learn on, especially for a child. I think you would be better off buying larger hooks and getting a beginner pattern. This just frustrated them and me."
4,Interesting Perspective from the Time,An interesting view of the Navy and the battlecrusier squadron from the time. Covers Dogger Bank but not Jutland
4,Very neat,"This book is excellent. It is not a whole system mind you but a great source book on planetary magic. Loaded down with tons of info and ideas, pictures and rituals. Not a book that is needed but a good book to have around if you need corespondences which are not all golden-dawn-y. Thank heavens for that!"
2,Disappointed in Quality of Item,"I bought this item for a nine year old girl. We had difficulty using the remote and thought that it might bedefective. After several attempts, we decided that it was just ""touchy"" and had to be pushed just theright way. After several days of using it, the girl lost interest because of the problems using it. (Not likeusing a video game). The concept of the game is great but lacks in a quality design."
4,Fun for a couple of hours.,11 year old daughter played for a couple of hours and then didn't play again for a couple of weeks. She has fun while she is playing it though.
4,Girls have fun,"My girls ages 10 and 13 both enjoy this game. It's not a 2 person game though, so the other person has to sit around and watch the other play. But alone, they are captivated by it."
3,Gets you started,"This book is a pretty good reference. It will help you learn PERL, which is actually pretty easy. The first fourteen chapters are excellent introductions to the basics of PERL. The last seven are simply awful attempts to teach more advanced topics. If you are a compotent programmer who needs to learn the basics of PERL in a hurry to convert a shell script, this book isn't bad. If you want to become ""Just another PERL hacker,"" you'll have to look further. TMTOWTDI, but this is not one of them."
5,excellent - nearly always 'hits the spot!',"When you've got a question such as 'how do I do xyz?',just flip open the book, and there's the answer -with anexample!An absolutely indespensible book."
3,I feel obligated to update my earlier review,"I reviewed this book last September; at the time, I thought it was a really good start for beginners. It's still a fairly decent start; problem is, the chapters on packages are incomprehensible. Once you get to that point, and you will get there pretty quickly, the book becomes useless. If you can find the earlier edition (yes, it's Perl 4, and yes, it's missing all of the Perl 5 goodies), you'll be a lot better off."
5,Excellent for beginners and experts,"I've been studying Perl for 1 year and I felt that something is missing. When I bought this book I figured out that Regular Expressions, Debugging and many other things was not that difficult. Buy this book and in 21 days become an expert in Perl."
5,Greate book to start off with,"If U know awk and C,Perl comes naturally.This book makes it easier.Chapters are well laid out.Good number of good examples.OfCourse if U want to know the advanced features there other are books in the market.Need to have good basics to appretiate those.That's exactly what this book achives.Give U strong basics of perl."
3,"A good guide, but there are better","A friend and I took this guide and some others on the L&C trail last summer. This is a good guide and it has fantastic information on camping as well as very good maps. I agree with others who have criticized the ads- I bought mine in 2001 and also found ads. Additionally, the binding in my copy was weak and pages frequently fell out. If you are getting a number of guides, I recommend getting this one. However, if you're looking for only one guidebook, I found Julie Fanselow's book more helpful than this one."
4,WOW!,"I brought this camera about....two or three months ago. I love it. It was cheap ,and it takes amazing photos. The PC Cam mode is great! The only downfalls is how quickly is eats up batteries. But that cam be remedied by A.) not using the LCD Display for every picture...and B.) BUYING AN AC CORD!!"
2,Problematic USB Drivers,"This seems like a decent camera for the money (if I could just get it to talk to my computer), but I have had a bear of a time trying to get the USB drivers to load correctly. I found the Fuji documentation and web site to be dissappointing with regard to troubleshoting for this problem. I fear I may have to return the camera since I've already put hours of my personal time into the driver problem -- I've used many digital cameras and this is the first time I've had this much trouble just getting the drivers properly installed!"
2,Ok Camera.,"The camera is ok. But not that good. It takes good pictures some of the time, but alot of the time you have to go back and take pictures over because the quality isnt what you would expect. Not enough zoom. Eats up batteries like you wouldnt believe!! I would suggest adding a little bit of money and getting a better camera. Fujifilm is not the best brand to go with. I have this camera and are currently trying to sell it. The very thin 5MP sony cybershot camera is what I am aiming to buy. It's has amazing quality pictures, but it is not cheap. It is by far better than the Fujifilm!!"
5,good mug,"Large, solid and romantic for those who love a good diner. Fits nicely in the hand, and dishwasher safe. Has everything but the waitress!"
4,The Scroobious Pip,"This is one of the most memorable books from my childhood. The illustrations are wonderful,and I spent many hours trying to find all the different animals, birds, fish and insects mentioned in the poem. It is a neat poem, too. I would recommend this book for second or third grade children or older. A young child might find the picture of the Scroobious Pip just a little bit scary."
5,Eventide--A storry of three young lives enmeshed forever,"Carrie, Lauren and Graham, three teens, meet in Italy for a few days in July, 1989.Three young people,whose lives would intertwine until Carrie dies at an early age.Graham learns about justice and forgiveness, and Lauren comforts the man who refused Carrie's love. Carrie did marry a man who loved as Carrie couldn't love back.Twenty years later,Carrie's husband, son, Graham and Lauren come together to say goodbye to Carrie. A cat, a dog, a boy,a stranger meet and suddenly the unexpected happens.This ia a story of love, forgiveness, and God's grace. You won't want to pur it down until you've read the very last line."
3,Buyer beware! Not for the whole family!,"I sat down to watch this with my daughters as a girls night ""in"". I had read all the great reviews and being Dove approved boy was I in for a surprise! There were some cute parts but the main character cursed a few times in front of children. Then she made a comment to her friend ""so I hope this doesn't mean he is going to want birthday sex"". Then another scene the couple passionately kisses while undressing one another. Fortunately I Googled reviews while watching and found that it contained this and was able to skip to the end to avoid it. Being a ""family movie"" I would have thought these things would NOT be in the movie. I would not have purchased this had I known."
5,a.k.a Poligraph Poligraphovich,"Bortko not only captures the language but the flavor of the novel. He transports you back to early Soviet Russia in grainy black and white that makes you feel as you are watching a movie from that time frame. The actors are great, impeccably carrying out the famous roles that are dear to every Russian. Bulgakov created a literary classic in this tale about a doctor who transforms a dog into a man with darkly amusing consequences. Meanwhile, you see the soviet system closing in around Dr. Preobrazhensky, who has no time for it as he tries to keep his foul-mouthed new creation reined in. But, Poligraph Poligraphovich is as elusive as the mongrel he was created from and finally Dr. Preobrazhensky has no choice but to terminate his experiment. This is satire at its best, a film that is every bit as good as the novel. One can only hope that the film will be made available soon."
2,It is OK,"If you plan to travel on one of the FLOTELS that operate out of Iquitos, this book will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect. It recounts much of what the guides will explain to you on your tour, and has some details of the Author's particular tour.There are a bunch of factual errors in the book, which is annoying but not damning. I was hoping for a more detailed description of the experience from a more experienced writer. Instead it is a light treatment of the journey.Well enough written and generally OK."
3,Not bad for this price,This is worth of the price.I bought it for $24.99. which is good pricefor this shoe. Actually my shoe size is 9.5 britishand 10.5 american. As reviewed by someone about the sizethat the size of the shoe is one inch more I ordered 9.5 americansize which is perfect fit for me now.Overall worth the price
4,good movies and the books are great.,"This author, Richard Paul Evans is abd exellent writer. The movies re great on the DVD, it took me awhile t purchase bu am very pleased."
4,Borrowed Hearts uncut,"I am a sucker for Christmas movies and CDs and got both with this. The CD actually has a couple of songs I don't have anywhere else and the movies were all quite delightful. However, I bought this in the hopes of getting an uncut version of Borrowed Hearts and am pleased to say that this DVD has it, the same complete version as was first seen on TV. The only two drawbacks I found on this DVD was it does not have closed captioning and it is a two sided disk. Wish they would have put them on seperate disks as they did the other 4 movie collection I purchased."
3,Holliday Collector's Set V.2,I purchased this product because I wanted the movie Borrowed Hearts. The other 3 movies and cd was a bonus! Got a good deal too!I have watched all four and while Borrowed Hearts by far is my favorite I was glad to have the other 3.The Man who saved Christmas was an interesting account of the maker of erector sets.. enjoy....
2,Holiday Collector's Set V.2,"I enjoyed the 3 movies, in this collection, that I watched.Not sure about THE MAN WHO SAVED CHRISTMAS--have not watched it, not sure that I will.I think the multiple movie packs, are a great idea!"
3,Book is ok,"I ordered this book, hoping to help elevate my prayer life. I am a candidate in RCIA through the Catholic Church and very much like a sponge trying to soak up information.This book arrived in my mailbox at the same time as another Catholic prayer book. This book was a little difficult to capture my attention. A little tedious to read through - and since I had received another book about the same time which totally fit the bill, this one was placed on the shelf.Maybe I need to give it another read, but for now, I would say there might be others out there for the novice or learning candidate."
4,good book,This book has good explanations and good pictures about how to ride. Also some about choosing a horse to buy.
4,review,our grand kids were thrilled and excited. they loved everything about the product and claimed it was the best easter gift ever.
2,It is not a practice book you understand it easily,It is not an instructional book you understand and apply it easily. it is for more text book which have been thought in universities.
5,Magnifico!,This is a great translation of a classic work. There are informative footnotes and inline clarifications that make the shades of meaning in the work more visible. I have read this book many times and each time I draw something new from it. It is an often misunderstood work because some of the themes it explores and such should not be the case because it is really a study of human interaction and the views of both the prince and the pauper are presented with exceptional clarity.
4,Prince of Space,"What can I add? I really miss MS3K. I HAD to get this collection, mainly for Prince of Space. I remember growing up and seeing this craptacular on a local UHF station. The two Hercules movies, eh. Some funny stuff there but the Shrews is better than both combined. Still, it a must have for any fan of MST3K!"
5,For the Fans Who Missed Out,"I have been a MSTie since the show first appeared on Comedy Central and I still watched it when it went to the Sci-Fi Channel and I must say for all those people who discovered Mike and the 'bots on Sci-Fi must get this collection. They must discover how much fun it is to watch those grade B itallian Hercules films. Hercules Against the Moon Men is a personal favorite of mine. I think it is great that Rhino is releasing these almost lost treasures. I wish they would release Wild Rebels, Jack Frost, The Day The Earth Froze, Attack of the Eye Creatures and Bride of the Monster only because Ed Wood rules!!!!!!!"
5,Battle of the sexes from a sci-fi point of view. Excellent!,"A virulent form of encephalitis decimates world male population and women take political and economical power. In the best tradition of sci-fi, Merle changes one item on our everyday world: makes males the weaker sex (original French title was ""Les hommes proteges"" Protected Men) and challenges our assumptions and conventions, meanwhile writing a page turner."
1,Good Author Bad Book,I dont hate the author and her books are good but this one SUCK!!! This book is a review of the 5th grade test study history with the boring Social studies book this book is much more boring. If you like this author DONT BUY THIS BOOK buy other books she made like Paul Revere but Dont buy this Boooooorrrrriiiinnngggg book!!!!
3,Cinderella in NYC,"Cinder-elly is a Cinderella version set in modern-day NYC. It's rhyming format and changed Cinderella elements really keep children interested. The ball is a basketball game, the prince is a basketball player, and Cinder-elly is not as helpless as the original. It is very entertaining."
4,"Filter is large, but works good","I bought this for my Axolotl tank as I needed a sponge filter so they couldn't get their little fingers or gills stuck in the filter uptake. I was very happy to find one at such a great price and with such great reviews so ordered it immediately. Upon arrival I discovered just how huge this monster is! I should have read the dimensions listed (though would have gotten it anyway) so I would not have been shocked by the size. A 4 1/2 in diameter takes up a huge amount of space in a 10 gallon tank (they are like what, 18 by 12?). Just a heads up for people looking at this product. Even with the huge size, this product seems to be working good and I have no complaints with it. I actually find the bubbling sound of the top quite soothing. :)"
3,Warped,"In order to clean sponge filters, you need to boil them.These, however, boiled a little too much. The plastic warped off of them and stuck to the bottom of the pan. :(Wonderful for smaller tanks though!"
3,Broadened me view.,Was not in agreement with some of the practices. Not a physic. Always learning more on this subject. Easy reading.
5,High Quality,"Well constructed, durable, excellent finish on the wood sanded. Tracks on the Makita sander just as though made for it. (It was"
5,Very Informative,"I have read other books by the same author.I liked them all, but this is the best so far.He does not follow one LRRP team thru their tour of duty and this allows him to choose the most representative and interesting episodes.His style of writing is clear,intelligent and entertaining.If you're looking for a book that takes you inside a LRRP team,this is a great one.The stories are startaling at times when you read what these very young men faced.There were lots of surprises."
1,The glue does not stick,The self adhesive glue doen't stick. I sus[ect it has set on the shelf too long i was very disappointed I have to spray adheisive on all the paper. very messy and not a good stick. will have to replace it very soon.
2,Just okay,"The Clean/Dirty magnet was just okay. I thought it would be a flat ""all-over"" magnet but it is really a cheap piece of plastic stuck onto a medium sized circle magnet. Sure it does the job but I was looking for something a bit nicer for the price. After all, its only a magnet and I'm guessing it cost $.03 to produce."
4,OKAY - It works,This is a piece of plastic with a magnet. Don't assume this will be something magical. It is a practical solution to a household problem. It works and I like it. It stays in place well and is easy to turn. I think I paid like $3 for it. It isn't worth more than $5. I would recommend this to anyone.
2,Very disappointing. Cheap!,"While this looked adorable online, in real life it's very cheap-looking. It also fell apart the instant it fell 3-feet to the floor. Definitely not worth it. I'm returning it."
2,Cheaply made,"It fell on the floor one time, and that broke the magnet free. it is in two pieces now. a little better glue would've solved the problem, probably. I'm also disappointed that it doesn't have a bigger magnet on the back, so that it can stick better to a dishwasher. oh well."
1,Lower quality than the dollar store.,"This came with the magnet not even glued in. Whatever glue they used it had hardened and fallen out so I couldn't use it without glueing the magnet back in myself. The plastic was so cheap I just tossed the whole thing in the garbage. It didn't cost very much, so honestly, it just wasn't worth my time to even mess with it. Total Waste!"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This movie was so boring and it dragged on forever. I did not like this movie at all and feel it was a waste of money. The only reason i bought this movie was because of the good reviews i read. Well i guess that goes to show you that not all reviews are right.. DO NOT BUY YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
4,Great interpretation on a classic,"The fluididty of transition between the play itself and the ""real life"" of the military boys is at times a bit confusing. At the beginning there is more ""not Romeo"" dialog that sets the stage for the conflict, but even so, the fight scene in the gym is confusing, since it is obvious that neither person ""dies."" With no adequate explanation of why there might be animus between the ""real"" characters of Tybalt and Mercutio the gym scene and Romeo's exit are confusing. Otherwise, the movie is wonderfully acted and is a compelling retelling of the ages old story in a contemporary, if unexpected, setting with a twist on the ending that both answers and leaves questions."
5,An Interesting Twist to a Classic...,"8 guys are left behind at Mckinley Military Academy where they have to continue with their every day strict routine.At the same time they re-enact William Shakespeare's classic, Romeo and Juliet. Incorporating the play's dialogue and assuming the roles of the central characters, the boys do a great job adapting the story to the current living situation at the academy. The two guys playing Romeo and Juliet have great chemistry that is absolutely adorable and their acting along with the supporting cast is superb. Great job!"
4,Romeo with a twist,It was interesting that most of the dialogue was Shakespear.I was wondering how they were going to handle the end with the death scene. I was surprised. I didn't want to experience a let down. It was fun. I might watch it again.
1,"forecasts are gone, what's the point","I've bought this annual since 1997. This year I bought it and no more monthly forecasts in the back, sign by sign. This to me was the most significant part of the book. The rest is good and helpful, but often feels a bit recycled year to year. It was the forecasts that made each year's edition truly unique. Why these are gone is a mystery, but, unless these return, this will sadly be the last copy I purchase. I rate it one star to illustrate just how much I feel has been lost."
3,Good but incomplete,"An enjoyable, fast read, but strangely lacking in serious analysis. This may not be the author's fault; perhaps there simply isn't enough information about Greene. Still, aside from the factual recounting of battles, I couldn't help thinking that the author made an entire book out of the following unremarkable contentions: Greene lacked formal schooling, but was brilliant; he limped and was insecure; he was extremely competent but prone to self-pity. The author repeats these sentiments throughout the book and attributes Greene's every action to one or the other. That may be accurate, but it hardly paints a very complex picture. Other biographies (of other subjects) offer a vivid depiction of personality in addition to analyzing motive. This one, somehow, does not."
2,Not what I expected,"This will teach you a few moves, I suppose, which is why I gave it 2 stars. It was definitely very low budget and didn't really grab my attention. Laurie Ann's personality is great but wont carry it through."
2,Not Happy,"Like many before me have said, not for beginners. It's always a treat to watch such a gifted choreographer but this is not what it claims to be. I have not even tried to use it in recent months. I simply could not follow this tape. Not a happy customer."
1,Dull,"The videos were of good quality so there's no issue with that.But the storyline was horrible. The timeline was too soon for Tabitha to be grown up. While Lisa Hartman was credible as Tabitha, everyone else was boring. Robert Urich has no comic ability but was nice to look at. Also Adam refers to Tabitha as his kid sister? He also lacks powers. OK fine the story changes.The real problem was the lack of purpose. There was no reason for Tabitha NOT to want to use her magic. Samantha had a reason to not use it. She married Darrin who thought she was a mortal. The whole point of ""Betwitched"" that made it so charming is that Samantha COULD have anything, but chose Darrin and the hum-drum suburban life. Why? Because LOVE is better than having the world at your fingertips or in Samantha's case a twitch.Without that reason, there was no reason for Tabitha not to want to use her powers and no charm. Also the special effects were poor. They were even worse at times than the original show."
3,It could be magic...if it tried a little harder...,"This spinoff series to Bewitched, one of the greatest sitcoms of all times, tries very hard to capture the magic of the original but just misses. It's cute in it's own way and fun to hear the soundeffects from the original series reused as well as some of the characters such as Dr. Bombay (played again by Bernard Fox) and the Kravitzes (played again by Sandra Gould and George Tobias). And who can deny how cute Lisa Hartman as Tabitha is.The problem though is that the characters don't seem to be fleshed out until the last couple episodes but by then it was too late. And the fact that this show started in 1977 only five years after Bewitched ended makes you wonder how Tabitha grew up so fast.The video and sound on this DVD release is awesome! Crystal clear and vibrant!If you're looking for some light fun you should check this out."
2,Not as good as Bewitched,"It doesn't share the same feelings like Bewitched even though they tried. I think the issue is they tried to mimic Bewitched too hard and yet they couldn't capture the original magic. As what their title song sung, ""it could be magic!"" Lisa Hartman was too ""trying"" hard to act exactly like Elizabeth Montgomery instead of building her own personality. By doing that, it made the character worst. They could make it a better series if they built on Bewitched but gave the characters different personalities."
5,WOW!!!! CHLOE HAS GONE CLASSY!!!!,"WOW! THERE ARE SO MANY PRETTY CHLOE DOLLS LATELY. CHLOE LOOKS SO ELEGANT & SOPHISTICATED HERE. I LOVE!!!! THE HAIR, THE MAKE-UP & EVEN THE CLOTHES!!! SHE IS ACTUALLY COVERED HERE! AND SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL!!!!! CHLOE, YOU ARE GROWING ON ME GIRL!!!!!! 5+++++ STARS. WAY TO GO BRATZ!!!!!!!"
5,Drop dead gorgeous,"OMG, this Cloe is totally wicked. She is sooooooooooo beautiful. I can't wait for all the dolls to come out, smae with the games, DVD, and playsets. Cloe so far is one of my faves. All the dolls in this collection are probably the prettiest Bratz dolls I have ever seen. Hopefully I can get them. Bratz, Danny Phantom, Family Guy, and My Scene ROCK!!!"
2,Who's Bio is this again?,"This book is much like that of the DVD, Candy Coloured Stripes... Unauthorized and Uninteresting.The author comes off as trying to cash in on the success of the a music group. The book is unauthorized and therefore there are no interviews with Jack or Meg hence... everything you get is either heresay or just not related to the Stripes at all. Many of the book's chapters focus on the history of Detroit and the history of many Detriot rock bands... those bands of course have interviews and a full length detailed bios on them.Again, as a lover of the Stripes, I love reading about them. However, I found myself getting more and more frustrated as this book went on and less and less entertained or informed about the subject matter for which I shelled out the money for this paperback."
4,Jack's the man!,"I love listening to Jack Webb's stacatto, scolding monologues to the criminals he deals with. Watch for Heather Menzies from ""The Sound of Music"" in one of the episodes. Also, Kent McCord plays a wrongly accused undercover cop in a prelude to his ""Adam 12"" role. Harry Morgan brings some comic relief as Webb's partner. I like how Friday and Gannon work a different detective division virtually every episode. This isn't what happens in real life, but I'm sure it was done to expose viewers to all the different types of detectives there are in Los Angeles. The DVD transfer is fair, but it's adequate. Awaiting the second season....."
1,Poor Quality,The DVDs (and inside jackets) were soiled/discolored and scratched. The video would freeze during play. I was able view only after washing the discs.
3,"Great Series, Defective DVD","I had recently purchased the Dragnet 1967 DVD Set, anticipating hours of viewing pleasure however, this was not to be. After episode one on the first disc, there was a disc format error that would not allow further play. After several tries on mine and a neighbor's DVD player, I concluded the problem must be with the disc. Five stars to Amazon for quickly processing my return and refunding my money. In conclusion, I think the disc producer should pay more attention to quality control, and not waste everyone else's time and money with defective discs."
1,The discs never work properly.,"This is the second time I tried to watch these shows. The first time I purchased this product 3 episodes froze. Then I bought another set thinking it was just bad discs. Nope, the same problem. If you buy this product don't expect to be able to watch all the episodes. Terrible quality, Universal should be ashamed!!! Save yourself frustration and find another way to watch these episodes!!"
2,mad ani fan,"ok, i'm a poor-little ani fan all the way from the land down under. what that means is, that unlike those who are lucky enough to live in and around the U.S (i.e, canada) i have to endure months of waiting for anything even closely ani-related (unless i resort to buying things on-line, which i don't). but anyway....i waited months for my copy of ""ani - righteous babe"" and i was sooooooo disappointed when i read thru it. ok, so it's not all mr. quirino's fault that he has no clue how to write a book....but how could anyone listen to ani's music for just 3 months and think that they know what they're writing about? i bought my first ani cd during a visit to the U.S in 1995 and even now, after 5 years, would never dare assume that i know anything about ani and the inner-workings of her mind based on the lyrics of her songs. oh well....at least the pictures were a bonus.i s'pose that mr.Q mean't well."
1,"An attempt, but hardly a good one","I was very disappointed when I read this book. Yes, I understand that the author did not intend this piece to be an official window into Ani's life... He states that he spent 3 months listening to ani's recordings, in an attempt to completely deconstruct them to get inside her head... I have spent nearly 7 years (I am, afterall, only 17) listening to Ani's music. And for one person to try to tell me just what Ani is ""all about,"" is so infuriating. Ani's music touches each one of us differently, in my opinion, as we find our own experiences mirrored through her work, whether or not that's what she intended... I must... point out there are so many inaccuracies that this book should be kept farther away from the beginners than from anyone else. And more importantly, the only true way (in my opinion) to experience Ani is through her words, thoughts, and emotions."
5,French edition,"This book has been translated into FRENCH and is selling now. It is about painting, about art. The French Title is "" La Peinture Chinoise, pas a' pas"".ISBN: 2-215-07592-9 It is good enough for France to have a translaed copy is good enough to be rated 5 stars."
4,thrilling,"This color 3D video movie shows all the super roller coaster rides in the US. With the special glasses provided, you see depth of the images. A nice effect. But the best 3D images come from the computor generated graphics showing the titles & construction of the roller coasters. They appear to ""pop out"" of your TV screen, a pretty cool effect thanks to computor immaging. Also, if you choose not to wear the special polarized glasses, it just appears to be a normal movie. I enjoyed the watching the special effects. It's also in Surround Sound."
2,Poor Quality,"Video and sound reproduction are very poor. All the shots are done with 8mm video and it is all hand-held. I would have liked it more if they had shown more cockpit shots instead of filling it up with mostly shots from the ground. The soundtrack is actually the worst part about this disk. I actually turned off the sound and turned on some Chemical Brothers while watching. Pretty fun, but not worth buying."
3,Aesthetically Non-Appropriate,"I tried to use this for my security cameras. I was thinking that it would inject the power over the Ethernet cable so that I could have one Ethernet cable go to the security camera.It turns out that you have to plug this adapter into the Camera power jack in addition to the Ethernet cable. . . rather than input the power at the switch, and run a single cable to the camera. The power cable provided from the adapter to your camera isn't that long either, so I didn't even bother to plug and test the adapter.They should've added this fact to the description of the product."
4,Beautiful pictures!,This is a great picture book illustrating the use of color in Mexican architecture and decorating.
2,A bummer,"I am an AS female, in a long term relationship with an NT partner, and found this book to be generally a bummer. It is full of Asperger-specific information, that's for sure, all of it depressing, in a ""hardwired"" sort of way, and none of it followed up with an exit strategy. I decided about a third of the way through that the insight was not worth the depression it was giving me. My therapist supported me in this assessment and suggested Aston's more recent Couples Workbook, which I have just started, but which looks like it incorporates the ""best of"" material from AIL and does include therapeutic strategies too.I also decided not to read any more AS books that were published before 2005, since the neurological information is that recent. Seems like everything earlier is based on speculation and urban legend, including Aspergers in Love."
2,English Sentences,"I bought this book because it was listed in the back of the Teaching Company guide to ""Building Great Sentences"" the course is great, but this book did nothing to help me"
5,Entertaining and Educational,"My 15 month old loves this video. When he first started watching around 6 months ago, I played the ""basic"" version for him all the time -- and he never got tired of it. Now that he's a bit older, he really likes the ""advanced"" version with the animations and additional educational songs/nursery rhymes. Definitely recommend this video for longer term viewing."
4,Brightest Flashlight in the World for under $70,"I bought several trying to find the best. I'm a fanatic. For example, I bought one from another company that claims theirs is the brightest in the world. It was only a third as bright as the Vector VEC192. There is another company that sells one for over $1000 that has about the same lumens as this one. For that price, you could buy the Vector for a dozen of your friends & family. Turn on the dozen Vectors and you'll have 39,600 lumens compared to their 3400.I'm very tempted to give it 5 stars, but the battery only lasts 25 minutes at full power, so I give it a 4."
5,Colleen Coble keeps you wanting more!,I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down. The end of each chapter kept me wanting more. Great ending and very unexpected. I went out and bought Colleens entire Rock harbor series after reading this book. You gotta get this book!!
3,Awesome to the max,"Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, Round 1What is there to say other than this is the most 80s-tastic anime there is. Tons of fan service, if you're in to that (I am of course). So...yeah...check it out. =)"
2,This may not be what you're thinking....,"I thought this was a trade paperback format collection of these classic Len wein and Jim Aparo/John Byrne stories which it is, but this is about a quarter of the physical size of an actual comic book; its black and white on newsprint but worst of all, the pages are comprised of ""redistributed"" panels, a convention that many had assumed died in the late 70s and early eighties when many of these reprints were done for ""pocket books"" for little kids.Still a great story, and one of the first attempts in the modern era to clean up Bruce Wayne's history during the years between the murder of his parents, and becoming Batman. I didn't realize they still made these poor reproductions, but I guess that explains the low, low price. Caveat Emptor."
4,The REAL best of for Dokken,"If you are wanting to pick up a Dokken ""greatest hits"" this is the only way to go. This blows the single disc Best Of out of the water and includes that entire disc plus some. My only complaint, like others, is their choice of ""live"" stuff over the studio version. Kiss Of Death and When Heaven Comes Down are 2 of their best songs (my opinion) and I would prefer a remastered studio version over another live version. That is why it gets 4 stars. But overlooking that, this is a great set."
3,Uneven,"There are handful of very moving poems in this collection. Williams' best poems are grounded by concrete imagery, and they are engagingly anecdotal. But there are too many poems in this book that aren't tethered to earthly things at all, and it is difficult for the reader to reach them. He writes engagingly about growing old and about war. The best in the collection is called ""The Hearth."""
1,the book is useless,"the book is a set of nice photos taken in different places, has short description a la ""how nice to visit"".most of them are extreme, you can be pleased by the picture but you will never go there, - does not worth it - to visit a cave you will not spend 2 or 3 days. bobsleigh adventure??? probably notyou can find much more useful info on the web.i was in sedona, arizona 5 years ago - this is nice place - a lot of walking, nice food, you can visit grand canyon, can do hot air baloon flight, etc - expected something like this - combo of nice living, food, interesting visiting for a week...alas, this book does not have anything descriptive and interesting"
4,Good Product but very small in Size,"Just got it, have not tried it in water yet. I am 5 7 and 134 lbs and wear a small in mens shirts and sometimes extra small and small in hats to but this beanie is way to small. I wished I got a medium. How suprising, for the first time ever in life, theres something to small for me. Maybe in time it will stretch. I suggest getting a large for all head types sorry big headed guys."
2,Not the most comfortable Beanie,"The Beanie is not the most comfortable one on the market, due to the very large and stiff velcro closure. I think if the manufacturer would have used a superstrech material, there would not be need for a velcro closure and make this beanie better.Othewise, craftsmanship is fair and good."
1,Luck not in our favor either!,"We purchased this train (a month early) for our three yr. old, (loves trains). It olny worked for about 4 hrs. While it did work it was the hit, but now I can't take it back because he still sleeps with it and I can't find another one, they are all out of stock. So as luck would have it we are stuck with a broken train, I believe it had a short in it or something to that affect!"
4,Round and round the Christmas tree,"I bought this train set because I missed out on a similar one at Home Depot. For the price, this is a real deal. It is stable (doesn't fall of the tracks every time around the tree), has sounds (a Conductor, engine, bell and whistle sounds), it has a nice big light on the Engine and plenty of juice with 4 ""C"" batteries (not included). Most definitely worth the money."
4,I Love It,The kid in me always wanted a Christmas tree train and this fills the bill. For the price I think it's great. It is rather loud and I don't plan on showing the grandchildren how to turn on the whistle and steam sound (although I'm sure they'll figure it out). If it gets too noisy I'll just send it home with them. Grandpa perks. Merry Christmas Y'all.
4,A must have for a beginner and the Pro,"This Book is a life time of information. All questions you can asked is addressed in this book. The only draw back is that some of the medications mentioned in the book are no longer produced. But as far as information on picking a good breeding pair to building a healthy loft to conditioning your Birds for the Big Race this book is unsurpassed. If you are going to buy only one book on Pigeon Racing, make this the one!!"
2,bad reference book,"the reproduction of black and white pictures are so dark on inferior paper as to be unuseable. reference pages listed in the index do not appear on the pages indicated. many parts of plants shown do not correspond to book title. i.e., since when do acorns or hickory nuts grow on bushes? do not reccomend this book to anyone really lookung for information!!"
3,A Nice Introduction to Shrubs,"If you are looking for a brief, mainly illustrated introduction to shrubs and vines, this is a great start!As a environmental biologist, I was slightly let down by the lack of species description, which is often times more accurate than a photo because of extreme variability of plants. I bought this text to be a quick reference and review of species and their basic morphology.NOTE: this is not a field guide - large in size and not durable."
2,Very average&Predictable,"Leela james has a decent voice,but how many times are Generic 3rd 4th rate Betty Wright Knockoffs gonna get on being turned out?? folks crack me up when they speak for more Live Instrumentation such as Rhodes,Strings,Horns,etc... but it takes a Strong Artist to make the Expereince that much more rewarding.Leela James is a dime a dozen Artist at this stage.a good Hook Artist who might one day have a few hit songs,but I doubt she will ever get the Riht producer&Songwriters to compliment Her Gritty Range. she needs to Follow the Mary J.Bliege formula of singing off a Hip-Hop based Producer&then work her way back into various styles.right now she is very Green&is Musically Lurking for a Hook."
3,leela,"I heard the whole album playing in a bookstore. I was impressed until I heard the no doubt classic, 'Don't Speak.'Leela does a good job with the song but I feel like that song should never be made over. Leela has a great voice but it sounds the same in every song. She sings and then always gets excited in the end repeating the same words over and over. It's like okay all ready. We get it."
2,The Pendulum Shifts Yet Again,"After reading Firewalk, I was very excited with Anne Logston's more mature style (as compared to her earlier books). But then after nailing Firewalk, Logston went too dark and earthy with Waterdance and then swung too far back into ""safer territory"" with Exile, a juvenile, start-and-stop book. I was expecting something along Firewalk's greatness and then I got a junior book trying to sound more adult. It didn't work. While I still like Logston as an author and will still most likely read her next book, frankly I'm rather frustrated. I hope the next one is better."
4,Filling Shake with good taste.,"I am currently useing this product and, first found the flavor of the whey a bit bland. Unlike the shakes that use soy, and are much more flavorful. But after getting used to the difference..and sometimes including strawberries, bannanas, and other fruits, I found it to be be quite good! I will re-order soon...Price was lowest I found on the web also..."
2,Did not work for me,"The inside approach is supposed to stop a slice but it did not work for me. The product's primary feature is that it stops an over the top move but this was not hte source of my slicing. Mine was caused by an open club face which the inside approach does nothing to help. Also even if you do make an over the top move, the bar is so high that you can still do it."
4,The Power of losing Control,Extremely useful strategies and tactics to apply and discuss with others who are having trouble accepting what they cannot change.
3,A good read but somewhat monotonous.,Joe Caruso wrote a good book; it is encouraging but lacks depth and insight. The sad thing is that I really wanted to love this book but could not get past the tedious philosophizing. I'm sure Joe means well but he never really grabs the reader.
4,"Simple, powerful tools for living life in joy and service","All I can say to a prospective reader of Joe Caruso's work is that you'll find some message of his that will stick with you, and actually it will help you more than once, which means it sticks with you even more, and someday that same message will then help you help others. His ""Losing Control"" book contains enough practical tools for living to keep you busy for a looong time, all of them ""road-tested"" by Joe himself. Thank you, Joe."
2,Missing the most important track!,I love the soundtrack to this movie... it's amazing music!Unfortunately the music from the opening credits which is the best piece of music from this film is not on this version.I bought it second hand fortunatly but I would've been sorely disappointed had I ordered it online and been expecting that piece of music.Just thought I'd let anyone who intends on buying this know.
5,An elegant soundtrack for a more civilized age......,"Kaze No Tani No Naushika was first released in early 1984 and has had several reprints since that time. This is truly Hisaishi's finest work. With rich instrumentation and arrangements, KNTN is sure to delight for many years to come!"
3,Decent Soundtrack,"In case you are uncertain, this is the Soundtrack for 'Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind' (original release) and 'Warriors of the Wind' (English release).Some of the selections on the soundtrack are pretty bad, sounding something like a cheap porn flick, but there are a few good ones too. The two sequences from the film that I wanted to have on CD were on this soundtrack, so the risk of buying it without being certain of the CD's contents was worth it.I assume that if you are looking at this soundtrack then you have seen the movie (either version). Let your ear be your guide then - if you liked what heard when you saw the movie then you will probably like the CD. If you haven't seen the movie, see it first before buying."
1,dont bother,"Battery opperated - needs rechargable batterys to work,if i knew this prior to purchasing this I would NOT have purchased it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I'd have to concur with some of the other reviewers. After Devil Wears Prada, I was expecting a lot more from this book and author. The story was basically the same as the first book, quite tedious and unimaginative throughout, and frankly, not very well written. It was hard to get through it."
1,Junk Food,"I thought this would be sort of a fun distraction, but instead I was just disappointed. You know that feeling of hunger before you try a new restaurant and the food turns out to be mediocre, but you are full? Well this is my best attempt to review this book. It seems like she is a good writer, but her talents are wasted."
1,Boring and poorly written,"I was a big fan of the Devil Wears Prada. True the plot was predictable and Weisberger is no Joyce, but the story was fresh and amusing. This book was a chore to read. Highly recommend avoiding this one."
3,Good then flat,"I couldn't put this book down since the suspense was gripping. Then the story just kind of ended, nothing realistic about the ending at all. Felt like the author was rushed by her publisher and just wrote something. Good to begin and half way thru, then nothing."
4,Great fun!,"I recently finished reading this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Weisberger outs the celebrity PR machine in entertaining fashion, much as she did the fashion magazine world in The Devil Wears Prada.I feel that I actually learned a little bit about how the industry works as a result of reading this book. Not something I expected from a chick lit novel!I read some of the other reviews and I'm having a hard time understanding why those reviewers disliked the book so much. As someone pointed out, it's meant to be a fun read, not world-changing literature.The only gripe I have about the plot of this book is Bette's love of romance novels. I kept asking myself what it had to do with what was happening in the story and kept coming up with the same answer, ""Nothing!"" Other than that, I enjoyed the book. I'll probably read Weisberger's next book as well. I'm looking forward to seeing which industry she lampoons next."
3,Good read,"I won't recount the storyline, as you can easily find plenty of that in other reviews. I have to say, I enjoyed this book, It was somewhat predictable, but fun nonetheless. It's a great beach/airplane/vacation read."
1,Not worthy of an afternoon on the beach ...,"I loved The Devil Wears Prada and was so looking forward to reading her sophomore effort. However, I was so disappointed. As others mentioned, this is a formulaic attempt at chick-lit, and a poor attempt at that.If a book is going to be interesting to me, I have to care about the characters and be able to even slightly relate to the situations they find themselves in. At no point do I care even slighlty about Bette or her predicaments. Characters appear and disappear, or they find themselves useful for only a chapter and then are gone. It truly seemed that the author had all of these great ideas, but she wasn't sure how to pull them all together, so she just threw together the pages of the manuscript and then wrote a paragraph to transition between chapters.If you really feel that you must read this book then borrow it from the library. It's not worth seven or eight bucks."
4,A fun read!,"I personally enjoyed Everyone Worth Knowing, and I think Lauren Weisberger is a great writer. I majored in public relations, so reading this book while I was in school gave a funny take on the way PR can go. Even though it's a path that I would never choose for myself, it's fun to get lost in a book that you can relate to, even just a little bit."
4,definetly worth reading,I found the book a very enjoyable read. It was a wonderful story that allowed me to enter the world of pr without actually having to not sleep.THe only complaint that i have is that the ending was to sudden and rushed but other then that it was fabulous.
1,Boring,"The dialog was trite, the writing and grammar poor, the plot non-existent, the main character spoiled and self-indulgent. For some reason this author's characters always walk out on jobs when the going gets rough. Bette, the main character in this book does it twice. It is a boring book. Not worth the effort."
2,Poor me protagonist - again!,"Everyone Worth Knowing is basically a rewrite of The Devil Wears Prada set in a PR scene. Decadence, extreme wealth, party-hopping, and the glamour crowds have never seemed so shallow, so unattractive. This is not to say the book is not somewhat entertaining, and readable; it is. It delivers what it sets out to deliver. I just wish Weisberger would take on a topic that is more interesting to those of us in the real world. Also, Weisberger's protagonists never have enough backbone to suit me. Let's see a strong woman in the next book!"
4,This is supposed to be entertainment...,"As an English major and future teacher of high school English, I am almost ashamed that I cannot tear myself away from books like this. I have read through several of the reviews from this book and I am quite perplexed. I sometimes think that people forget that reading these types of book are purely for entertainment, not literary study (even though I took a brilliant course in college featuring the most popular ""chic lit"" novels of the last decade and LOVED it). I enjoyed this book. It entertained me, kept me on my toes, and made me laugh out loud several times. It is just nice to sit back and read a book solely for my own enjoyment and not for the need to analyze something for literary purposes. I recommend ""Everyone Worth Knowing"" to someone who wants to go sit on a beach, relax, and read about a life that most likely none of us will ever experience."
3,Leigh.C,"This is probably my least favorite of all of Lauren Weisberger's novels. If I hadn't read all of her other novels I probably would have like it more; however, I held her to some very high standards that this book just couldn't reach. I refuse to give one of her well crafted, clever novels below 3 stars though, because even though I couldn't quite relate to this book, it is still a good read."
3,Acceptable decent 2nd book,"I got this book for $5.00 brand new in the bargain bin on AMZ. I will be honest that i purchased this because Lauren wrote The Devil Wears Prada. The movie was enjoyable but not as good as Working Girl. Anyways the book itself wasn't that great. It was all over the place and it's understandable since she is a 1st time writer. So i decided to give this book a chance because it was soooo CHEAP and it was a brand new hardcover edition. I don't do paperbacks. Anyways, as any writer or reader knows you improve as a writer the more you write. So i was under the impression that Lauren had improved and she has. The book for the most part was enjoyable and decent. I found this to be better then Lipstick Jungle which was just a word fest mess."
3,"""Devil Wears Prada"" rehashed...","My main problem with ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was that Weisberger still sounded very involved in the story. I hoped that her future writings would improve once she felt less involved in the story.Well, it seems that Weisberger has learned from her mistakes from ""Devil"" - unfortunately, she has done so by rewriting ""Devil"", just in a new setting with new names.The book wasn't that bad by itself, though, and made a pretty enjoyable read, and lets us take a good look at the NYC partying scene most of us aren't exposed to.I just hope Weisberger finds another theme to write about in her next book."
1,Bored thirty pages in,"I guess that kind of says it all. I read 80 pages waiting for the book to get interesting but it never did. I found myself skimming to page 100 which is the kiss of death for a book. The people are shallow but not interesting. One good thing though, my copy is a library book, didn't cost me anything and I can just give it back."
5,Perfect for my little ones... and entertaining for us!,"This was a great Christmas movie for my 2.5 and nearly 4 year old. We don't do a lot of screen time and when we do, we prefer to keep it shorter for their ages, so this was perfect. It can be hard to find good, shorter movies for kids.The boys both loved it, and my husband and I were entertained (and touched!) by it as well. My husband even thought it would be great for one of those traditional Christmas videos to watch with the boys every year.A few minutes in, the grandparents stopped by and sat down to watch with us.Very happy with this purchase!"
3,Helpful but somewhat dated,"Aa a newly diagnosed individual with Multiple Myeloma I selected this book as the best one to read to get an understanding of this disease. While it was helpful in many ways, since reading it I have become aware of the significant advances in treatment for MM that have been made since this book was published. Reader should keep this in mind when reading it and not rely on it as their only resource."
3,Dissapointed only 4 tracks...,"Just got this single yesterday. Well, I like the song but I felt disappointed due to only 4 tracks (all club mixes). Where is all the Radio Edit?List of the tracks are:(a) Album Version 7:06(b) Jacques Lu Cont Versus Remix 6:34(c) F*** Me I'm Famoous Remix by 8:35David Guetta & Joachim Garraud(d) Low End Specialists Hollywood Mix 8:49Would appreciate Amazon ammend the songlist before make any confuse by another buyer again. Tks."
2,I could barely watch them!,"I could hardly watch them because I know they are in black in white so what i have done is tone down all the color.MUCH BETTER! Also another thing is that all the episodes are from 1964-1965 but all of them say copyright 1966!Why? Anyway I didn't enjoy what I saw. Here is one other thing, the feature magic and mishaps is in black and white!HUH? You have been warned!"
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT I'VE WAITED FOR YEARS!!!,"Love it! Love it! Love it!! I have grown up with sporatic episodes here and there and not being able to find out what time Bewitche is on or not and now, I can watch the episodes in order and whenever I want!! It's Great!"
4,colorized version,"The first season of Bewitched has great episodes. You can get the episode guide on tvtome.com, and it will tell you season by season what all the episodes are about. Even though this was originally shot in black and white and has been colorized, it looks good. Not completely natural. The eye colors really stand out, and look a little artificial, but overall, the effect is not that bad. I originally saw the reruns in black and white and wanted to see it in color, so I bought season one in color, and I'm glad I did. It is a new and refreshing way to watch one of my favorite shows. But if you want these episodes for nostalgic reasons and saw them in black and white, you may want to buy season one in black and white."
5,Love it!,"Bewitched Season I is better than I remember. Samantha is funny, wise, and good at putting Darin in his place. The picture is clear, the sound is great, and the color is absolutely perfect. You really can't tell it started out as black and white. I look forward to buying Season 2!"
2,E01S03 It Shouldnt Happen To A Dog (Grace Lee Whitney episode),"For some reason,I didnt find this episode very entertaing. Im not sure why. Maybe its because one of the first episodes of the series and everyone is still ironing out the buggs. Grace Lee Whitney did the best she could with what she had to work with."
5,"Beautiful, original black and white","I am so glad there is the option to buy the first and second season in it's original and glorious black and white. That is totally part of it's charm. I wouldn't even consider for one moment buying the colorized versions of the black and white seasons. I liken it to colorizing the Twilight Zone episodes or Alfred Hitchcock. There are some things you don't mess with.These black and white episodes take us back to a time that was more simple and yet oh so comfortable. If you're a true Bewitched fan as I am, you will relish watching and re-watching these wonderful episodes in their original, fabulous black and white.And how beautiful was Elizabeth Montgomery is these episodes. To me, the Grace Kelly of the small screen. So elegent. A true beauty from any angle. Durwood was a lucky man. :-)"
4,"Turn up the heat, sort of","The book wasn't easy to locate, but I had no trouble at Amazon. I had seen an interview with the author, and wanted more information. The book contains lots of information, some more helpful that others, but I am disappointed that the bulk of the book is meal plans and charts."
5,Core Values,"Core Values is a fabulous book. One of the best I have read in years. The flying exploits are exciting and keep you riveted in your chair. Better yet, the story chronicles the need for impeccable character in our military and civilian leadership. After the events of 9-11, the book takes on a whole new meaning. Bossert is one of the next great writers to hit the streets and his clarifying writing style will keep the reader engaged throughout the book."
3,Union Jacks,"I have not finished the book but find the author's assessments so far harsh. He spends a great deal of the first chapter commenting on the stupidity and ignorance of the sailors while quoting extensively from letters and diaries written by the sailors. The description of the dirt and filth he provides don't jibe with his talk of the efforts to clean the ships. He says the sailors are personally dirty and then describes what, in a later day, would be called a ki-yi bath when the dirty sailor was bathed by his shipmates using their clothing scrub brushes. It seems inconsistent to me."
2,Proprioceptive Method for writing.,"The proprioceptive method is a good way for some people to learn to write spontaneously and overcome the blockages often impeding creative writing. As described in this book, which included a music and candle rite, it did not work for me in the writing I'm doing.As to the delivery and service received from Amazon, I give that 5 stars."
4,A Different Watson,"I have been a great admirer of Russell Watson through his previous three albums and I like this new one, but not as much. I am not as enthusiastic about the new post-surgery voice as his other reviewers seem to be. It appears to me that his voice is not as powerful as it was before although it is still very melodious. Moreover, I am not crazy about his choice of songs in this album, nor the new softness in the arrangements. I really prefer the voice that was so dramatically beautiful singing operatic areas and songs like O Sole Mio, Volare, Ave Maria, etc. I hope that that Watson is not gone forever."
3,Not bad,"The book does a decent job,but I was under the impression that it was kinda like a school book,in teaching watch theory and repair,the diagrams are excellant,some of the watch repairmans secrets are revealed,how to build a bench is explained,as is,the neccessary tools,the biggest complaint I (personnally) have is that I wished he had used a blow-up of the indivisual parts(with their names)and where they go,then I would have an easier time with the names of the parts and how they fit together."
5,A Must!,A must for those interested in Open-Air Preaching. Many helpful hints and a How To Preach Open Air by John Wesley amd C.H.Spurgeon.
5,Work Well For My Needs - Highly Recommended,"These Howard Leight ""MAX-30"" corded foam earplugs work well for attenuating loud noise in work or sporting environments and the long cord helps them from being misplaced when taken out. We use these at the range by themselves when shooting small calibers and in conjunction with standard ""earmuff"" hearing protectors for larger calibers.These are comfortable and fit me well, highly recommended!CFH"
5,"If you ride a motorcycle, you need these!","These are fantastic fitting earplugs. I'd highly recommend getting the corded ones as they're easier to keep track of. In addition, it's easier to take them out with a gloved hand. I thought a couple of pulls on the cord would destroy them, but out of 100 pairs used, I've NEVER had a problem. Save your ears, get these plugs!"
1,Keep Looking,I purchased this vise for gunsmithing work. It is incapable of holding an item with any real force. The jaws have chipped and chunked since I have been using in over two years. When received the tension screw was off-centered and crudely made. I can't believe how poorly it was made compared to other vises. I would not recommend this item.
5,vise,"This is a very well designed vise. I have not had it long, but it works well as a gunsmithing vise, which is what I use it for. I'm sure that if I was abusive that I could break it, but I don't like to abuse or neglect my tools."
4,Vice for drill press,I guess most people would use a drill press cross vice for their drill press. I decided to buy the parrot vice and adapt it to my drill press because my press is radical and has many ways to make adjustments. The parrot vice is somewhat unique and I bolted to my drill table and turned it on its side to get more room between the bit and the vice. I would recommed this as a vice I don't think you should hammer on the jaws but it is a good lighter duty vice and it would be good to also use for woodworking.
1,pos,I bought this vise On January 5 from Amazon. I used it a moderate amount of times with no complaints. The other day I was clamping a 1/4 in. rod and felt something give. The piece that secures the vise from rotating broke. On inspection the metal casting is of poor quality. I called shop fox and wouldn't you know there is no replacement part. I now have a vise that is totally useless. This vise is good for securing small items of plastic only. Don't waste your time or money. A real POS.
5,Door security latch/Lock,"The lock is stellar. Can easily attach to the door. Easy to install. Wish they gave you at least a an extra machine screw in the event you strip one. Still overall the product is solid and works aweso,e."
3,this isn't really universal,"i have a trim around my door thats at least a 1/2 inch taller than the door when closed. so installing this took a little more effort. I had to shim one of the pieces so it could close and catch but I know it wasn't made for that, still I got it to work but don't buy if your door and the trim around it aren't close to the same height."
1,Late delivery,"Due to the shipping policy of Amazon and its affiliates, I was unable to collect the item in time and had to leave my address for an extended trip abroad.It took forever to cancel the item and get a refund"
5,Great,"It's a great transcription of the ""PICTURES"" You should also check out the guitar solo transcription available at the Japan website. Do a search for Pictures at an Exhibition for Solo Guitar on Yahoo and see what you get."
2,So-so story,"My daughter loves Strega Nona, so I decided to try this sequel to the original. The illustrations are great, as before, but the story is so-so. For one thing, it reinforces gender stereotypes in telling us that Big Anthony cannot train to be a strega, only the girl character Bambolona can. And it gets too complicated and strung out, loosing momentum with a detour about Anthony trying to be a baker."
3,Interesting,Too much interviewing and dialogue - just don't care. My wife and i laugh at the interview.
5,Wields Occam's razor with certain skill.,"A mass of erudition such as Prof. Pipes has acquired over the years often stultifies clear thinking but, as his work on Russia has invariably shown, he knows how to subordinate knowledge to lucid analysis and how to express his analyses with clarity.The central point of the book (for me) is that property has historically represented the principal boundary to the power of the state. Those who remain devoted to the idea that freedom is sufficiently protected by a democratic franchise, or to the even more idiotic one that ""property is theft,"" the privilege of wicked persons guilty of frugality, energy, enterprise, intelligence and provident parents should not read this book. They shouldn't read any books. They should go play with mud-pies or something, anything, and leave books to adults."
4,Provides exactly what you need to begin writing Java games,"The first half of the book concentrated on single player Java games. Provided with the book is a Java Framework within which games can easily be constructed. The first half started off great, however too much time was spent on explaining how the framework was built rather than on how to utilize the framework fully. There were some nice explanations of how games are constructed and some of the practicalities of playability and fast graphics. The second half of the book dealt with networked multi-player games and was much more difficult to follow, due to a very technical writing style. It would still be quite a climb to construct a multi-user game in Java."
4,A family's nightmare = a reader's delight.,"Robert Curran (who co-wrote with victims Jack & Janet Smurl and deomonologists Ed & Lorraine Warren) relates a whale of a tale about how the Smurl family suffered from ever escalating paranormal activity in their home until the place became unlivable. The amount of seemingly corroborative evidence (via witness accounts from various neighbors, some anonymous and others not) gives the story an extra boost of needed credibilty, but it's more intellectually intriquing than emotionally intense. Recommended."
5,answer to prayers,This breastshield was an answer to prayers. I didn't know that there were different sizes of breastshields. I was using a 24mm and a very nice lady told me that there were different sizes. I went from hating to pump to being able to sleep while pumping.
2,Wasted money!,"I thought my production was down b/c of shield size, but these were too small, I have no use for them but they are not returnable."
3,The old Santa Fe trail the Story of a Great Highway,"Very interesting but hard to follow, needs more definition of the year and what is happening during that time. It seems to run together and I forget when it the fights and wars begin and end."
5,VERY PLEASED !!!!!,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PHILIPS CD RECORDER. IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PRICE; I FOUND IT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION; IT RECORDS BEAUTIFUL MUSIC;AND IT ARRIVED ON TIME AS PROMISED. I WOULD DEFINATELY ORDER VIA AMAZON.COM AGAIN AND I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM BUYING FROM BIL1953 IN THE FUTURE.....THANKS AGAIN
5,Best Windshield Wipers I've Used,"This is the 2nd set of these I purchased. First pair were at the local auto parts store, but since they stopped carrying them I found them on Amazon for half the cost locally (no surprise there...should have checked sooner). These wipers are amazing. I have them on my 4Runner, and they last about twice as long as the similar ""factory"" wipers I've put on my wife's Jetta. Probably get 2+ years out of the set. Extremely quiet even when its dry (cleaning with washer fluid).As long as they make them for my current cars, these are the only type going on them."
5,Simply beautiful!,These bowls are simple and elegant. The color is beautiful. No silly dog paws or other juvenile designs. Love them.
2,Pet Bowl,I purchased this item only to receive it and notice that it was not as thick of stone that it look to be in the picture.
4,works,does what its supposed to do. allowes me to use my ps2 controller on my ps3 and pc no complaints
2,Doesn't work well for arcade sticks,It doesn't work for my arcade stick. I wanted to use this for my arcade stick but it doesn't work and this thing doesn't even have a home button.

1,not great,used it once didn't really work but i guess i gave it to someone and they use it in a pinch better of just buying a controller .... DON'T BE CHEEP
1,ps2 to ps3 no go,"i had problems with this device, couldn't get any old controller to work on my phat ps3. the idea was cool....just wished it worked."
5,Works for NBA 2K10,"I purchased this adapter because I have 4 PS2 controllers and it makes no sense to purchase more PS3 controllers. I bought one of these to test out and it worked very well. The response was good and all the buttons responded. I'm a sports gamer, so I'll be purchasing more of these in the future for the rest of my PS2 controllers."
3,so so,it works decent for using a regular controler but i bought it hoping i could use it for my ps2 guitar hero controlers and some stuff just doesnt work right when using it this way. enough of the functions worked so i was able to play my games with it but it wasnt quite the full experience
1,Prejudices colour quality,"An innovative idea! I couldn't wait to start reading this book, an emalgamation of East and West. Unfortunately, I found nothing in this mass of stereotypes and personal negativity with which to identify as a British Asian, the portrayal of Asian characters is insulting and lacks any real objectivity. A tragic disappointment"
4,"sleep, sleep sleep","at first I was disappointed that the scent was more flowery than I expected. My last pillow spray from Healing Garden was ginger lily and not as strong. However, it works just as well and I'm off to sleep in no time. Not an easy thing for me. M. Bucks County, Pa"
4,"Vince Jones ""Trustworthy little Sweethearts""","Cool rendering of standards and originals by the ever reliable Vince. This 1988 album shows Vince at the peak of his harmonic form. His trumpet leans towards the Chet Baker white boy diatonic non vibrato school. Strangely his singing is more chromatic. He draws the listener in and the experience seems personal, a far remove from the imitative cool hacks. Worth a place in any serious collection."
2,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I HAVE MANY CUISINART PRODUCTS, INCLUDING 2 COMPLETE SETS OF THE CHEFS CLASSIC STAINLESS.I HAVE A MODEL 719-16NS. I'M VERY CAREFUL WITH THE AMOUNT OF HEAT USED, NEVER OVER MEDIUM HEAT.FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE MY COOKWARE. IT'S THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.THE REASON I'M GIVING THIS A 2 STAR RATING, IS BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE.ON MY PAN, THE COATING STARTED TO SEPERATE FROM THE METAL, BY THE HANDLE RIVET. UPON CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE, NOT ONLY DO YOU PAY FOR THE SHIPPING TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE UNIT, BUT YOU HAVE TO ENCLOSE A CHECK TO COVER THE RETURN SHIPPING AS WELL.TO ME, THIS IS TOTALING UNACCEPTABLE....TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RETURN SHIPPING. FOR WHAT IT WILL COST ME TO PAY FOR SHIPPING BOTH WAYS, VIA USPS, I CAN ADD $15 TI IT AND BUY A NEW ONE, THAT SHIPS FREE."
2,Not good for wet winter weather,"I bought this thermometer because the face looked exactly like our current one, which broke after many years of use. Once I received it I looked at the back and the wire coil was completely exposed, unlike our old one which had a cover on the coil. In wet winter weather the exposed wire coil will probably freeze up in a minute.Good for dry covered outdoor spaces but not where rain/snow will hit this thermometer."
5,Too far and few between...,"This memoir was moving, almost beyond words. I was poignantly and thankfully reconnected to the reasons I most wanted to be a therapist many years ago. Mr. Barber's efforts have produced a work of distinction for its openness, sincerity. and fearsome humanity. Kathryn J. Mas, Ph.D."
1,Not worth a dime. Not even worth one star but I had to put one in to continue.,"This piece of equipment (if you want to call it that) is not worth a dime. Very difficult to cycle even against a wall. No stability at all. It keeps moving side to side. Very cheaply made. I only bought this because of the good review. That review is a sham, I will not trust these reviews again. Do not buy this, you will be sorry you did. I am."
5,Great!,I own the darker hue powder and it's fantastic. It really adds body to hair and cuts any extra oil. It has a fresh lemony scent and great texture. Since I have really long wavy hair a spray on/comb-through formula just wouldn't work as well for me; the powder formula lets you really have control where you use it. I have not used it on my body but as a hair powder I would recommend it.
2,Just skip the intro,"I've just read this book for my Intro to Theology class. While the publisher and the comments on the back of the book seems to cherish the 100 pages of introduction by other scholars, I have to say reading through the first 50 pages makes me want to pull my hair out or stop reading this book altogether.I finally took the advice of my wife (who got an earful about the Intro) and skipped the last 50 pages of it. Suddenly, I found myself enjoying Augustine, which is simple and reflective. With all due respect for all the scholars who wrote the intro, which I am sure are much more educated than I and the reason I could not appreciate their writing is no doubt my fault, I think it is a tragedy that in setting the stage, they only obstructed and frustrated the readers. Nor am I alone in this, most of my class disliked the intro. Maybe it is not meant for 1st year seminary student, I don't know."
4,Good product,"I bought it over the summer while I sat outdoors to read, bothered by flies. Thought it'd help. Not really sure why, stupidity on my part i guess. It smells nice:/ and the flies loved it too. There were no mosquitos where I was so not sure how effective it is in that regard"
5,"Interesting, insightful, and readable","The author offers an interesting and insightful account, both scholarly and readable, of the origins and evolution of an important international planning movement. I was particularly intrigued by the way various nineteenth century reform strands, including several looked upon as the fervent pursuits of crackpots and cranks, fed into Ebenezer Howard's synthesis of an ideal community combining the best aspects of rural and urban life. Many who aspire today to a ""simple life"" that treads lightly on the environment would do well to visit Howard's ideas as examined here. I appreciated Dr. Buder's even-handed assessment of the contributions of some of the so-called fringe element to what has become the modern field of urban and regional planning, providing a timely reminder that the synergy of many diverse points of view often results in workable and innovative solutions."
5,Finally!,"Serena-AMEN! I am truly inspired. I totally and completely understand and agree with you. My only regret? That I didn't get to be the one to say it like it is...ah, well. There will be other times.Anyway, this toy is really cool. I like this due to its beauty, sparkle, and sheer femininity. I especially like Yasmin."
3,alright.,"I use my phone a lot.I loved this phone when I first got it. Its durable and good for those who tend to drop phones because of the bumpers. A month or so after, though it started to have problems. First the reception was not very good, then some of the number keys didn't work. The bumpers also started to rub off."
3,Its Ok,"The Nokia 3220 is a fun, creative phone but it has pros and cons.Pros:Changable CoversVery DurableSmallGood battery lifeCustomizableCameraSpeakerphoneCons:Primitive menus and optionsBad quality cameraBad service signals(where I live at least)Quiet SpeakerphoneAnnoying ringtonesVERY small memorySmall screenButtons are to smallOverall, this is a fun phone that is very small and cool looking, but it has a lot of problems that Nokia could easily be fixed if someone tallked to Nokia about it. I would recommend this phone to the lower age group because iat first sight it's not much of an adult looking phone."
3,Average phone,"Pros: Long battery life, reasonable size, loud, nice speakerphoneCons: Limited memory, no bluetooth, limited group control, confusing UI"
1,I HATE THIS PHONE,"I usually love Nokia phones but this phone is a piece a crap. I would prefer to get a Motorola phone then this phone. I have had this phone for a month. Within this month I've had important calls dropped, the side panels for the lights have fallen off, and the reception is awful. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GET THIS PHONE. WARNING: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PHONE."
4,Booster,"Have been using this product for several years mostly in smoothies and shakes and yes there is a bit of a weird taste maybe from the pea or possibly the mushrooms that have been unable to mask no matter what tried. Yet nutritionally this booster is quite good... so, in my opinion, it is worth it; maybe have even developed a liking to the taste. Currently using this product more in foods like soups and it really seems to work better flavor-wise. Also for baking (breads, muffins, vege-burgers, loafs) it's a great way top bump up your protein intake."
2,GREAT LINEBACKER...FAIR BOOK,I have found that most sport books written before the player retires are lacking and this book is no exception. It is kind of a replay of the 1971 season the year after the colts super bowl victory. I believe he wrote this book as a statement in favor of pro football because at the time there were alot of anti football books out. He gives his views on many topics and many of them are still relavent today such as instant replay. The book had very few insights into Mike Curtis the man and also very few chuckles. In comparison Dick Butkus's recent publication I would rate a 5 star book.
2,I would pass.....,The Charmer (Liar's Club) by Celeste Bradley was terrible. I found myself half-way through the book skimming and skipping parts - just to get to the end. Collis Termayne was a great character in the early novels but lacked something in this one.
3,First Half of Book Was Tedious,"Collis was indeed charming, and Rose was fantastic, a perfect heroine, but the telling of the story through the first half was tedious and uninteresting. I found it interesting that all of the Liar and Royal Four stories took place in the same year, 1813. That could have been a disaster but the author pulled it off very well. I've never read another series with that many books in it, where the time line was so close. Well done."
5,Funky and fresh!,"Of all the shirts I ordered, this one is my favorite! The sleeves, or really lack of, are great! The length I love and the belt is such a great built in accessory. It runs a little big (in the width). I usually wear a small and it would look better in x-small."
3,Good Resource Marred By Horrible Editing,"With a book this expensive you would think they could have found a decent editor, but such is not the case. This book is filled with hundreds of grammar and spelling errors (at times several on a single page) that would have been caught by even the most casual editorial review or even a read-through by an English 101 student. The editor of this volume (William V. Harris) should be ashamed to have his name attached to it.If bad editing does not bother you, then I can recommend this book with five stars. It retreads a lot of ground in the field, but the author deftly combines a number of sources into a unified whole. Although by no means worth the $135 if you are simply a casual reader, the first two chapters alone (1. Supply Needs and Rations, 2. Packs, Trains and Servants) make the book *well* worth it for military historians hungry for hard numbers and thoughtful extrapolation."
2,Put the $6.49 towards any of her other books.,"Ms. Keyes does herself a disservice offering the short story, especially for nearly the price of a full paperback. She is one of my favorite authors. I love the Walsh sister novels. This short, short story has a great premise but little else. Please skip this and read ""Watermelon."" This does not give a true picture of this author. If she offered my money back on this, I would take it. Didn't enjoy it at all."
4,"Not his best, but still some of thebest","I will have to say that I am a huge fan of R.A. Salvatores work. I still try to read other authors books, but can't get into them as easily as Salvatores. This is another wonderfully written book by Salvatore. I will have to say that it doesn't quite hold a candle to the previous two trilogy books, but I will have to say that overall it is still in the top 5 of my all time favorite books. His work is outstanding. I'll be reading the next set as soon as Amazon gets em to me."
2,it's not precise,"This metronome is not precise. I feel strange when I using it, so I use my clock to test(set it to 60 per minute and compared with the clock). It turned out that it would go faster that it should be, the difference could even be seen in just a minute. Then I test it with online metronome, the result also shows it is not precise. I don't know what happened, I think Wittner should be a great brand. I am not sure whether it has been damaged during the delivery or just because I get a substandard product."
1,Barbershop Claptrap,"This book is nonsense. It makes sense to me that the world's most powerful have influence on world events--even undue influence. It makes sense to me that some hope to create a new world order in which economic ties erode and eventually override political ones. While I think Curtis Dall may have many truthful things to say, his style is so full of inuendo, half truth, and guilt by association that I could hardly recommend this book as a credilble source for one working on a Ph.D. in History. I do not essentially disagree with Dall--I just think his approach is that of a amatuer who is not fully there mentally--and for that reason his potentially good book falls short--rediculously short.He reminds me of the claptrap one used to hear in the old Barbershops of the 50's and before. Belly-scratching bloviating. This tome belongs on the shelf with the UFO books."
3,Troy-Bilt Mulching Vacuum Blower Model TB320BV,"The motor takes a minute or two to get up to speed, but once it does it runs smooth and has good power at the highest setting. Don't expect it blow wet leaves or even wet grass though. The speed control lever is my biggest complaint. It's big, and I constantly hit it with my knuckles, knocking the speed control down to the lower settings. Even worse the vibration causes the lever to bounce to the lower settings on it's own. This causes me to hold the lever in place with one hand, and the blower in the other.The vacuum is powerful. On the lowest setting I was able to vacuum the leaves and pine needles from the flowerbed, leaving the lava rocks behind. The higher settings were powerful enough to suck up 1-2 inch size rocks (not recommended). I did not have any problems with the bag. The spring on the vacuum door is rather tight and it was difficult getting the vacuum attachment on with only two hands."
2,engine seized on me,"After using the blower for about 2 years, the engine seized on me and I was not able to start the blower."
5,"A compelling story, beautifully written, documented and produced","Having read George Weigel's seminal book and seen the documentary on broadcast TV several times, I was happy to be able to obtain the video in a well-made DVD version. For anyone interested in Karol Wojtyla's public, personal and inner life, the video offers a concise yet comprehensive and compelling narrative, illustrated with video of places he knew and people who knew him. Especially for people of faith, the narrative of his life and witness is deeply moving."
3,products details not right,"why in product details of this dvd says ""subtitles: spanish"" if it doesn't ???the film is very good but i bought it to watch in spanishnot very happy with it..will be hard to trust next time if there just says anything"
1,False advertising,This product did not have additional language options as expressed by the product detail. It's for this reason exactly that I seldom purchase from independent sellers
5,Review from one his students,"Being a tutee of the author has given me a unique perspective on the work. Peter's examination of the animosity between Arnold Bennett and Virginia Woolf is highly illuminating and will be useful to first years stressed about Moderations. This particular reviewer was also keen on Peter's use of Bourdieu throughout the text. Bourdieu's sociological theories have come into prominence, especially as they formed the basis of Toril Moi's new work on Feminism (What is a Woman) and it seems to be that these two critics would find much in common. All in all, this is a good effort and, while it betrays the eagerness of style that is common with younger academics, signals the emergence of a radically historical and radically textual politics in the literary sphere. We await with eagerness his latest effort tackling the linguistics of detective fiction."
3,cozy powell's lastest good album,it's a pity to him.In the lastest 8 years of his life he was wounded by accidents of motorcycle 3 times fellen from riding horse for 2 times.this album he ask billy sheehan and steve lukather play with him and they do a good play on it. In the track 3 the style was very like the david lee roth's band.
1,"Little Gore, Much Bore","Whoa, the reviews on this DVD had me thinking I was going to have some serious western style horror action, WRONG! This movie was one of the most DRY and boring pieces of dung I have ever seen! There was barely ANY action, zero gore factor, and acting........hahahahha, yeah! This movie isn't worth $1.00."
4,SLOB IS TRULY UNIQUE!,"I am not a horror fan reader, but this book accidently fell into my hands and drew me in instantly.CHAINGANG Butowski is a monster unlike anything I've ever read, including Red Dragon.The book moved along at a bloody pace with rich background of this huge serial killer that enthralled me. My only complaint was the battle scenes and the ending that left me feeling somewhat flat.The editing of this book is atrocious too. There are so many mega-overlong sentences that at times it just made this hard to read somewhat.But Rex Miller's style of writing is mostly compelling and chilling, and is that not what you should expect in a horror, serial killer novel?I will try the next one in the series, so that says something about it."
3,maybe I'm anti romantic,"Thoroughly enjoyed first 2/3 of this book, andthe Prodigal Brother analogy.I just found it hard to believe handsome radiopersonality would fall in love with someone thatwould lie to his face to avoid conflict.Problems nicely solved, but not plausible tomy cynical mind."
2,wrong cables,i had the wrong spark plug cables for mi sidekick the cabkes didnt look like the ones from the picture...
3,First cut is fantastic. The rest is mediocre.,Not worth the money I paid for 1 CD. I am so very disappointed! The disc and box in perfect condition.
3,Not the ducky I ordered,"I understand the description said colors may vary, but not the whole style of the ducky. I ordered a girl ducky as a babyshower gift and got some boy sport ducky. If the pic for the product is geared toward girls it should be a girl ducky that I receive. I'm still giving her the one I got, but I was pretty dissapointed."
5,Doing the wine cork kit,"Made the tray using a friend’s collected corks. I alphabetized them, which added to the time, which was about 10 hours. Prospective buyers might be advised that it is not a quick turnaround. But it was one of numerous Christmas gifts and the hit ."
1,SHAME ON STAN,"LIGHTSPEED may be the worst superhero film ever made. What was Stan Lee thinking of? The special effects are ludicrous and the story is abysmal. It also has four of the worst leading performances committed to cinema: Jason Connery shows none of the suave acting ability of his father and is horribly miscast in the lead role; Nicole Eggert proves her BAYWATCH babe status does not an actress make; villain Daniel Goddard overacts horribly; and Lee Majors---well, no one's ever accused him of being a good actor.This is definitely a loser."
1,One star is too many,"I kept watching this just to see if it could get worse - and it did. Right the way through to the miserable end. Every few minutes.The ""Python"" actor Daniel Goddard was absolutely appalling. If I was in the cast, I'd probably have to commit suicide as the least painful option compared with living with the shame.What was the director thinking of? Goddard was incomprehensible - is he the producer's son or something? No redeeming features at all - this film must instill horror in everyone unfortunate enough to be connected with it, and dismay in anyone who watches it."
4,... & the pursuit of happiness,"While Elaine may have life & liberty, she has rarely known happiness. Into SUNSET TERRACE she moves with her two daughters after three years on the road. 12 year old Hannah, her sister & turtle settle in for a long hot summer. Here they get to know the other families & Hannah is taken under the wing of the fiercesome Bridget, a foster child with a past & a not-so-nurturing present. She also has a daring & dangerous sense of adventure & courage.SUNSET TERRACE could have been unrelentingly depressing, after all what's romantic about welfare moms & their damaged children? Except Rebecca Donner has infused her debut novel with an intense look into children's live as well as realistic hope in the way Elaine searches for a better life.Rebeccasreads recommends SUNSET TERRACE as a devastating & hopeful glimpse of the pursuit of happiness."
1,horrible wipers,These wipers didn't last a year. They wiper compound did not stand up to the cold. The wipers started making horrible noises and caused streaks on my windshield.
2,Not as great as I expected for the price,"I was really excited to have a great pair of wipers, but these left streaks after two weels of use. Major bummer."
4,Effective at all speeds,"This wiper is Aesthetically pleasing, and pricey. But on the plus side it works even at high speed, and is super easy to install, this is the 2nd time I've purchased these wipers. I'm very happy over all. 4/5 stars for the price."
5,Funk Drumming: Innovative Grooves & Advanced Concepts (Book & CD),"Its a great book if youre into Mike Clarks drumming...It isnt so much progressively based, by that I mean it doesnt have you DEVELOP starting say ""here at A"" then work your way progressing indifficulty to eventually ""here at Z"" - meaning start easy at first, methodically develop your skills until you reach Z - from A to ZThis book dives right into Mike Clarks drumming, his drum beats are given and you can ""have at it""Sweet drum beats to learn. But again, it isnt as much a method based book where you progress and advance as you go. It is pretty much, theres the swimming pool, jump in and swim.Great book none the less because you have access to some SWEET funk drumming patterns / grooves alot of which are played by Mike Clark on the accompanying CD.If youre a Mike Clark fan, BUY THIS!"
1,Terrible movie in Italian,Bette speaking Italian? NO NO NO. This movie is not worth watching. I love Bette Davis and Joseph Cotton but this movie with its subtitles and our Bette speaking Italian ..well...it ruins it all for me. I suppose this is when she could not get work in Hollywood and did make a couple of Italian movies but the other one I know of is in ENGLISH not subtitled.
5,"I laughed, cried, and was horrified",The book is written beautifully giving a lot of details. I can't think of more to say but get the book yourself and find out how moving it is!
1,"Lord, she is abusing your song!!!!","Robbie Williams (not only the world's most hadsome man!) sings in his song ""Angels"" ""...a lot of love and affection..."" and you can really feel that! But in Jessica Simpson's version you just feel a lot of hatred and aggression!The whole world is laughing at America, because they do not accept Robbie Williams as the wolrd's best singer and entertainer. In August 2003 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) he had three concerts in England. And EVERY concert was visited by 125.000 people! For his world tour 2006 he sold 1.6 million tickets on ONE single day! That's just one of his world records.Poor America!"
2,eh...,"I really agree with those who stated that Robbie Williams' singing suits this song much better. I enjoy most covers, but Jessica just didn't do this song justice. (not that I liked any of the other covers she's done either)"
3,Disappointed,"I bought one that looked like the 1738 from Walmart for 17.00 and i wanted one that was better,so i payed you 100.00 plus 25.00 ahipping.It is no larger or heavier than the WALMART. Now you have reduced the price to 29.00.Willard Forbes"
4,when we dead awaken is a thrill ride for anyone who seeks a good thrill,"I have been searching for this book for ten years I first got the book in 99 on a class field trip and fell in love with it from the first page the story, centers around a family owned motorcycle shop. Two brothers one more responsible the other a little more reckless find themselves at war over some woman. The book takes you for a lot of twist and turns some you see coming others you don't. It was well worth the hunt to find it, although ten years is a long time, but if i had to I would spend money to buy it again"
1,Resale Price Accurately Determined This Book's Market Value,"The retail market for this used book had numerous websites selling it for 1 cent with a $3.00 shipping/handling fee which says it all.""I'm gonna getcha"" or variation of this phrase is repeated ad nauseam in an effort to frighten readers. Billy Parrish is a crazy psychopath turned ghost who seeks revenge on his family. Billy's family is supposedly cursed and his brother, Jack, went so far as to have a vasectomy so as not to carry on the curse. Jack marries Elsa who already has a child named Corky. The reader is dragged through the each and every family members repeated ad nasusem nightmares which again are supposed to be ""scary"". The author eventually explains Billy's life and death and the reasons he acted like he did. It was an incredibly long dull journey to the end. The free market is right-this book is worth every ""penny""."
5,Great on many levels,"A few weeks ago, I was forwarded a Facebook link to Lynn's page and daily photographs. I became interested in how he came to be where he was and so I picked up a copy of 'The Blue Bear', turned off the TV and had a very enjoyable couple of days. His descriptions of Alaska and it's historical underpinnings, his sharing of personal relationships, and in particular, that with a Japanese wildlife photographer, leads you through a series of peaks and valleys. I had a hard time setting the book aside and am now captivated by life in Alaska. For a unique and historical visit to southern Alaska, I would highly encourage you letting Lynn be your guide."
5,The Blue Bear,"Excellent book - well written, very descriptive & informative -highly recommend it for the poignant story of friendship, self-discovery & love of nature."
2,so so book,"This book didn't really apply to my flower girl and if anything, it focused more on her being nervous when my flower girl is so excited and she thinks that it's HER getting married. Since it didn't really apply, I ended up returning it."
4,Sort of tastes American,"These were good, but I specifically ordered them with the thought that UK Kit Kat's taste different than American ones. Upon arrival & opening, I decided that they taste quite similar, so I'm not sure it's worth the extra money, but the family ate them anyhow! :) Be advised, these aren't the chunky type kit-kat, in case you were expecting that."
4,Lucky,"This is a romance movie (chick flick)from author of ""message in a bottle"". It was a good story if predictable but being a guy I could take it or leave it. I gave it a good rating because it portrays honor and character along with romance. Watch it with your wife or girl friend and score some points!"
4,Loved this movie,"I've never been interested in anything by Nicholas Sparks, but the combination of the Louisiana setting and the plot of a battered vet looking for a girl he'd never met captured my attention. My wife and I both loved it, and will likely watch it again (rented HD version from Amazon Instant Video)"
3,Typical Romance movie.,It was okay. I really like Zac Effron. I didn't think the chemistry was genuine. I think the story had more potential.
5,Great movie!,"This is a gret movie! Husband and I both loved it. It worked good, no problem with playback. Good gift idea."
5,Great Romantic movie,I loved this movie very romantic and Zac Efron is a great actor. The young boy in this movie was very good as well.
3,typical,Zac was decent ...better than I thought he would be .Taylor is bla not great acting..story very predictable as you would imagine
3,"nice movie, but predictable...",this is a spin on the army guy falling for his dead buddies widow or girlfriend. after about ten minutes into the movie you can start predicting the action. very formula.
3,Don't like ultraviolet,"Got this for my wife knowing it came with a digital copy, but it came with ultraviolet. Which required software or additional apps to play on the computer or iPad. Doesn't work as well. Movie is fine"
4,You'll be a 'Lucky One' if you buy this movie.,"While no movie can capture all the nuances of the book, this does its author credit! The characters are very likeable, even the nemesis, at his end. The only problem was the suspense the book had as to who was the survivor was omitted. Otherwise very good."
5,Great...,"Other then the fact I had to sit through an entire movie with my girlfriend swooning over Zac Efron, this was a great transaction. Thanks..."
5,Get it!,"I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks but my gosh, I was wondering when the couple would actually live to love each other. I couldn't take anymore...well, death. Let the couple live for the love of God! I loved this movie, although I still have not read the book. I am pregnant and of course...emotional, but took a chance on this film and I am happy I did. I even found it on Amazon (black Friday week) on bluray for $3.99! When I received it, I put it in my stocking as a gift to myself."
1,O M G SO SAD AND DEPRESSING EVEN AT THE END BARF,"If you want to be sad and depressed, watch this movie. OMG. It is going to take me the entire day to cheer myself up after watching this very long sad sad sad movie. Even the so called happy ending was intensely sad. I hope you are on some seriously good antidepressants, because if not, this movie may cause a problem for you. Good lord! I am sticking to comedies and action! Wow. So sad!"
2,"Cheesy lines, cheesy scenes, predictible plot","Mindless chick flick? Definitely. A movie that offers up a unique plot and doesn't leave you constantly comparing scenes to other cheesy chick-flicks? No way. Not worth your time unless you're in the mood for a mindless, predictible chick-flick."
2,A bit slow,"The story line was slow and predictable. It was a nice movie, but really never got moving. And the two main characters had little chemistry."
2,Boring,This is a boring movie. Even the women watching it agreed that it wasn't that romantic and lacked the magic that other movies in this genre are able to capture.
3,The Lucky One,I waited so long to rent this movie and eventually bought it. I would say it is a nice movie and I can watch it again. A soldier seeks out a woman he that saved his life just from finding her photo in the war. He finds this woman and wants to tell her how and why he is there but can't find the words and eventually she finds out about him. Misunderstandings happen and eventually they find each other again.
1,I did not like it,It was too long between action with overly predictable story line and definitrly not enough romance or comedy for my liking. I would say I was drug to this once and there isn't a horse strong enough to drag me back.
4,Lucky One - Great chic flic!,"The Lucky One was a great movie. Good character development and good drama. Zac Effron played a quiet, mild mannered, army guy well. Definitely a must see chic flic."
4,Beautiful Movie,I have heard how great this movie is and I would have to agree. I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me in the moment the whole time!
1,boring,I thought this was one of the most boring movies I have ever watched. I didn't even finish it. The actors were boring as well. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
5,awesome movie,Loved this movie great acting and beautiful story line. This movie gives everyone hope and glimpses at what can happen if you only believe in love
4,"very good , but the normal predictable love story","This was good, but predictable. It was obvious a great deal was left out, as some scenes just seemed to end and did not transition very well. I downloaded the book to my digital reader and will read soon- I expect the book will be a much better story."
5,The Lucky One,This was bought on my kindle for an airplane ride. very romantic movie which I love. Very touching movie. Not a real long movie either.
4,great movie,I was not let down by this movie. I like the story and Zac Efron. Good chick flick for a cold night.
2,Ok but not great,I have quite a few of the bessey clamps but these were a little cheaper so I bought a couple. They seem to get stuck if you get a little glue on them and you have to fidget with them to get them to slide right. Did not have the problem with my bessey clamps and will buy those again. Not bad but not great.
3,DECENT,"This is decent soap for anyone who has complexion issues..i wouldent advise this soap to people who have delicate, dry or sensitive skin, its a litle to strong.."
3,Someday we'll remember this and laugh.,"This is a fascinating artifact of the Bush administration and its now famous effort to disseminate fear as a political expedient.The simplistic line art illustrations, reminiscent of an airline emergency procedures card, are a tragi-comic indication of the governments estimation of our docility, our incapacity to think critically and absorb information, and our feelings of vulnerability. My favorite is an illustration of a two dimensional figure with trance-like vision lines, permanently cast from his eyes to his automobile with a caption: ""Unless your vehicle is under constant guard, there is a danger of it being rigged with a bomb.""What is even more stimulating than contemplating the scale of the manipulation that this implies, is to ponder what the process of creating such a work must have been. I mean, some civil servant actually got paid to sit around and dream this stuff up!"
2,OK Product for the price but doesn't quite deliver...,"I bought this cream because I was looking for a stretchmark cream that wasn't too expensive and had decent reviews. I used this product religiously and slathered it on my belly twice a day for 8 months... the smell of the cream is awful but I ignored it thinking it would prevent stretchmarks. Well, I was disappointed when in my 7th month of pregnancy I got a TON of STRETCHMARKS. My doctor told me that stretchmarks are ultimately determined by your genetics and there is no product out there that can completely PREVENT stretchmarks b/c it depends on the elasticity of your skin. I also read in a book that the skin breaks from underneath vs. creams that only treat topical skin."
3,Great sound but Cheap Looking,I bought this for my friend on his trip to china it looks really cheap in person but the sound quality was great
5,"Beautiful unit, great sound!","This is a wonderful unit for any audiophile. The classic design fits into any decor. It plays radio, CDs, tapes, and LPs easily.The sound is full and rich for such a small unit. It can play 33, 45s or 78s. For anyone that wants a nice CD/Tape/Radio that also wants to play their old records this is a great choice."
5,Excellent Reference for DB2 Fundamentals!!,"Read bind to bind to know some useful hints on DB2 fundamentals. It's very concise with useful TIPS. One of those essential books that can be on your table, especially if you are preparing for Exam-700."
1,...,These clamps should be avoided at all cost. These clamps break at the neck (the part the handle screw goes into) and jamb any time it the temperature changes...
3,Good clamps; questionable quality,"I've bought several of these clamps; two of them were permanently stuck closed, and no amount of banging and prying would make them open. On one that wasn't stuck, the casting that houses the stacked plates broke as I was tightening the screw. I'm no gorilla--I was just turning the handle with normal hand pressure, and POP, the whole thing came apart sending hunks of pot metal flying across the shop. To their credit, Jorgensen was very prompt in sending me a replacement with no questions asked. I just hope the breakage was a fluke...In theory, these should be good clamps. My experience makes me concerned."
2,No me gusta,"Si Santana decía que el rock es una piscina y el jazz el mar, este disco es una bañera. Uno de los misterios del mundo es que a alguien le gusten los temas de Andrés, sobre todo porque no hay originalidad, se entiende muy mala leche de fondo en las letras (muy argentino)y además sus producciones no aportan nunca nada nuevo. Pero si han premiado a otros porteños con tan poco talento como él, por ej. a Fito y lanzado también a Coti, debe ser que el mercado está sordo y desorientado. Prefiero a Charly, Gieco, Spinetta, Moris..."
5,Great CD!,I needed a good patriotic CD to play for my American celebration and this did it. Recommended highly.
5,I love Echo Bodine.,"I just love Echo's books. This one is no exception. She writes very clearly and practically...everyone would benefit by being even a little more in-tune with their intuition, right! We've forgotten the ways of our ancestors who depended on their inner guidance system to survive.. before technology and emphasis on thinking took center stage in our lives. Imagine the possibilities if we were to utilize both effectively in our lives! wow."
5,"A Still, Small Voice: A Psychic's Guide To Awakening Intuition","I loved this book, couldn't set it down!"
4,Travelling by book,"No big trips for me this summer. Not by plane or train anyway. Instead, I've traveled by book. A Parrot in the Pepper Tree carried me to Spain, to the mountain home of Chris Stewart and his family. With the Stewarts, life is always a degree or two west of normal, with all the odd Spaniards of the world apparently living within walking distance of the Stewarts' home. Don't expect a big rollercoaster adventure; Pepper Tree is more of a hike through a quirky human zoo."
1,Tribute to Jack Johnson,"I am a HUGE Jack Johnson fan...and when I came across this CD, I decided, why not pick it up??!! This isn't really what I expected......it says ""various artists"" which isn't the case.I was looking forward to hearing VARIOUS ARTISTS performing Jack's music.Oh well."
3,Not as pictured,"My husband bought this pendant as a birthday gift to me since I am a fan of all things octopus and opal is my birthstone. When it arrived, he was disappointed that the opal was blue (I guess it is supposed to be similar to a black opal) and cheap-looking. I wouldn't dare let him return it because it was the thought behind the gift that mattered to me and I liked it despite it not being the color opal we wanted. However, if you are buying this for yourself, be aware that it may not be set with a traditional white opal. I wish the seller had let him specify what he wanted, maybe if you contact the seller you can get exactly what is pictured."
2,"So, Dave Cantor's Moved to the ' Burbs?","Long awaited and very disappointing.The appeal of DTS has been the incredible song writing of Dave Cantor. What'shername can sing, no doubt about that, but so can innumerable other stylists. What set DTS apart has been the brilliant tunes, clever word play, urban and urbane imagery of the songs. If this was my first experience with DTS I'd have yawned twice and never listened to them again."
5,Made In USA!! A bit heavy for some projects,"These are my favorite clamps overall and the best bar clamps I've used. They have a long, flat surface and can apply a lot of even pressure. Because the bar is like an I-beam it won't bow up in the middle when you clamp it down tight. The bottom of the clamps and the end are flat so it will stand evenly either horizontal or vertical without falling over. And the standing end can be placed at either end of the bar to make it a spreader as well as a clamp.These are not lightweight, so there are still occasions I'll pull out a lightweight bar clamp (I like Jorgensen for those too) or one of those 1-handed squeeze clamps. But the Jorgensen cabinet clamps are the workhorses I feel I can always count on."
2,buzz kill,"No one has supported the music of Kristen Hersh more than I have. I buy everything she does and have seen both her and ""muses"" dozens of times. That is why it is so hard for me to trash this record but sadly, it deserves it. Point to one song on this record that is better than anything on ""Sky Motel"" much less ""Hips."" It doesn't exist. It's quite alarming when a brilliant songwriter stumbles like this but one could only hope that it turns out to be a salutory event in the end."
3,Too Inconsistent To Be Exemplary,"Kristin Hersh is brimming with otential, yet this album seems rather sparse on inspiration. The music lacks any sort of real cohesion and the album comes off as an altogether rather hit and miss effort. Some tracks like ""Spain"" and ""Ruby"" show the talent she showed with her band Throwing Muses while the majority of the album sounds like outtakes. With a voice rather reminiscent of Joanna Newsom, she is rather an aquired taste. She can certainly write some catchy songs yet on this album it seems like she has become caught up in sounding alternative for the sake of proving a point, that point being a non-conforming artist. If this is non-conformity, what is the norm? Because this album is by no means normal in any way. It ends up becoming an effort just to listen to this album, in some instances it does reveal a true beauty. But for the most part it is a sparse wasteland of boredom."
2,Can't hear it.,"Bought one, had to take it back because at full volume I couldnt hear it. Got another and still had the same problem. Now I have a Garmin and can hear it fine."
1,nextar--limited use,"THIS PRODUCT IS THE 2ND ONE PURCHASED. 1ST ONE QUIT AFTER ONE YEAR OF USE. JUST OUT OF WARRANTY. IT PERFORMED WELL DURING THAT YR, SO I ORDERED THIS THE 2ND ONE. IT ALSO PERFORMED VERY WELL, UNTIL JUST BEYOND WARRANTY. THEN IT SUDDENLY QUIT, JUST LIKE THE 1ST!! WOULD POWER UP BUT WOULD NOT PROGRAM UP. TRIED THEIR WEBSITE, ONLY TO BE FURTHUR FRUSTRATED. SEEMS LIKE THESE ARE PROGRAMMED TO FAIL. ""FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME."". FORGET ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. I HAVE MOVED ON TO ""TOM-TOM""."
3,Bad charger connection,"I have the 4.3 inch Nextar GPS. I've had it for about 2 months. Now the conection from the car charger to the unit is broken. Trying to get a 12 V DC to 5 V DC (2A) charger is almost impossible. Kohls where I got is does not carry replacements. Try to get it from Nextar is near impossible. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a new charger cord anywhere, and without it, the unit is trash. I love the features. Good audio, fairly quick response, good touch screen response. The one problem that I sometimes get, is that it thinks it knows the town, or street that I'm looking for, and it won't let me search any further, when in fact I have not been able to enter the full street address or city. That has been a little frustrating, but in a couple of cases, the city was different the the post office address."
1,INCREDIBLY POOR PRODUCT,"I gave it one star because I have to give it at least one star; otherwise, zero. This is a zero light. It takes 15-18 hours to charge and works for about 15 minutes. Of course, after using mine 3 times in the past year, it will not charge at all now. DO NOT buy this product! I will be digging out my receipt to see what I can do, even after a year."
2,Warrior?,"'Brothers' was his best record from the 90's. The best tracks were covers (Blues Latino, en Aranjuez con tu amor) but Luz, Amor y Vida, was his very last instrumental masterwork, a diamond. Since then all his stuff sounds cheesy, cheap, lack of soul."
3,-For the Classroom ONLY-,"As the other reviewers stated, it is hard to learn from if you dont know any italian. Im learning from the teacher mainly because it jumps all over the place and it starts off hard. The first chapter is about greetings and questons but then it gets into forms-plural and unplural, formal and unformal, masculine and feminine.... its a lot to take in for someone just starting out the language."
5,My favorite book on the shelf other than my bible.,"This book is the favorite book on my shelf other than my bible. I go to it often as it helps me to embrace the perfect love of our King. I found that I did not gobble it up as I have other books, but rather sipped it like tea savoring the Truths inside. I cannot find it in print anymore, but when I find someone special God would like me to share it with, I order one that is ""like new"" and send it on to a friend. I highly recommend it!"
3,The Perfect Love: A Book Review,"I love how this book addresses hoe God's love can truly transform your life from the inside out if you just allow Him to.Myers' did a fabulous job in taking this principle and relating to personal events in her life. In doing this, she made it easy to relate to her as the author, and to apply these truths in my life.Overall, this book was a fabulous refresher on truths I already knew to be true, but sometimes just need to be reminded how much God does love me and how His love can be evident in my life.Disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher in exchange for this review. I reviewed the Kindle edition."
4,Great up-beat performance by the best of the Blues Singers,This song is very good. It is has excellent vocals and great singing and playing. Paul Rodgers and Geoff Whitehorn at their best.
3,Pronunciation is not standard Dutch,"I am a native speaker of Dutch and reviewed a couple of the lessons in the free trial portion of the manufacturer's website. I noticed right away that the female voice overs are decidedly not standard Dutch pronunciation, the person who speaks the texts is from the south, or from Flemish Belgium. This may not be a big deal but if you want to learn a standard Dutch pronunciation don't rely on this software."
3,it's a magnet that hold knifes (and stuff),"it's nothing special. i wish i would have paid more attention to how much plastic it has but i have it mounted out of the way, so no biggie. i saw complaints about the wall anchors it comes with so i used my own. it's stuck to the wall well and holds everything with a nice amount of magical.. i mean magnetic power. it's a nice option for the price and i would recommend it unless you're looking for something that looks really nice."
5,Former Pilot,From a former Anchorage Glacier Pilot this documentary was wonderful. The authors covered the entire 100 year history of baseball in Alaska. People and teams change but the scenery does not.Gene Stohs
1,Don't waste your money,"This is horribly hard and too big in order to be held in your fingers, especially when you need to massage with lotion, it just does nothing but keep falling off your hands, because it's hard clear plastic, which is crazy hard to tell through a listing picture here.Don't buy it."
5,fantastic,"These are so amazing. I had seen them before, but it wasn't until they were used on me that I truly discovered how enjoyable they are. Perfect for use by yourself or on a partner. Nice inexpensive and easy to use tool to add to my collection of relaxation toys."
5,Wonderful Title,I highly recommend this anime to anyone who like Stan Lee series. The animation is great and the story is filled with action. A++!
4,Good Vibes,This vibrator has terrific bang for the buck...or should I say vibrations for the buck. My husband brought it along on our honeymoon and boy was it a teriffic addition. The batteries last forever and the speed adjusts from a slow vibration to a furious rumble. It makes me climax everytime I use it.
3,"First half great, second half not great","The book is a good description of the history of the sport. Combined with the Master Exley's ""Caverns Measureless to Man"", one has a good set of stories on the origins of the sport and some of the scary stories.The second half unfortunately seems a little anecdotal and turns into something that only the die-hard archeology enthusiast would want to get further into. While entranced in the first few chapters, I got pretty bored with the rest. If you want horror stories from caving, read also Exley's Basic Cave Diving - A Blueprint for Survival. It's a hand-typed, thin pamphlet of a book, but it's one of those essential reads, even if you don't intend to do the sport - like me."
4,1/2 carat round cz,"This ring combo looks very nice, but do not really care for the 2 prong setting, and am not sure why they did it this way. The jacket ring is just lovely and can be used with other solitaires. Nice piece of jewelry for the price. Good replacement while getting diamonds reset, but can be worn as a wedding set themself, and few people would know."
4,Stunning ring for a great price,"I bought this ring set as a replacement while my husband took my original wedding set with him on deployment. I bought this set back in March and have been wearing it since. Got many compliments about the set. Very stunning set for a really great price. The only complaint I have is the ring sizing. I normally wear 5.5 ring size, and I have ordered a 6 and it's pretty snug to my ring finger so the ring sizing is running small. Something to consider about if you order but other than that, it's a great set!"
3,Don't get your hopes up,"The product looks very poorly made and cheap. The fit is good. The pic was misleading at best, but I guess you get what you pay for. but you must remember that this ring should only be brought as a temp Not for long-term use."
2,It'll do,"I ordered this for my wedding becuase we are very tight with money. Reading some of the reviews I expected it to appear to be ""real"". It doesn't so much but it is pretty.Update-Made it past a year of marriage and this ring looks horrible. It has broken my finger out numerous times and it is incredibly tarnished. The small CZs aren't shiny anymore, you can barley see them."
4,Faux Wedding Set,The center ring (yes this is 2 pieces) is very nice for the money. I will wear it and it could pass for real. The other piece looks cheap. I do plan on wearing it when I'm not wearing my real wedding set. For what I paid I was happy with it.
5,A breakthrough work,"Closer to Freedom is a breakthrough work that changed the way historians of slavery think about gender, resistance, space, and bodies. Camp sketches out the way that women responded to and at times resisted the demands of slavery, breaking from the image of the runaway man and the left-behind woman. In well-drawn sections on women who go truant or absent themselves from the plantation to hide in swamps and forests for a time, Camp explores the way enslaved women tried to create space for themselves. A book that builds upon and extends the pathbreaking Ar'n't I A Woman, Too? by Deborah Gray White, and one of the key works that changed the discussions of gender and slavery."
5,So cute!,I love this beanie buddy hes so cute and soft! It was delievered fast and quick within the week and on my doorstep.
2,"Works well, but dies quickly","I have used the Olympus Pearlcorder T1000 for the past five years in my current position. It is easy to use with no problems or inconveniences (except perhaps the earpiece being uncomfortable and losing the little padded covers easily). The very unfortunate and serious problem with this transcriber is that is simply does not last. I would estimate that I use it for approximately five hours per week, and yet I have already gone through two of them. I am now looking to replace this one again since the fastest speed is barely understandable because it is dragging so badly. I would not be able to recommend this machine, and am now trying to find reviews on other possible replacements."
5,Better than I had thought it would be.,I've only had to use this ladder a couple time and I have to say for a step ladder you will not find a better one. The only thing I found wrong with it was at the top their supposed to be a magnet but it's not strong enough to hold a small bolt and nut. Other than that this ladder has great support and works for me.
1,UGH,"it SAID ""new""--it was used, not at ALL what I wanted--and the seeds were bad. I really want a refund, to be honest, but I've already planted said seeds, so I guess I can't do that--the soil was just a bunch of dirt that they obviously found outside--everything had holes in it--it wasn't the kit at all!! The only reason there is even ONE star on here is that amazon won't let you post a comment without ""rating"" it. >=("
1,Lackluster collection of notes about popular science seasoned with rudimentary human interest,"What happened to Arthur C. Clarke in 1975? The masterful author of short stories from the 1940s and 50s created a confused mess titled ""Imperial Earth"" in 1975. In this novel, Clarke displays his poorly-concealed desire to appear as something other than a science-fiction writer: namely, a mover-and-shaker of science and technology. This unfortunate tendency appears throughout Clarke's later work. Who cares that Clarke once spoke to Neil Armstrong (note to chapter 21)? I can't put my finger on when, exactly, Arthur Clarke digressed from the creation of superbly crafted fiction into the monotonous exposition of dull popular science, but ""Imperial Earth"" appears, to me, to be the epitome of this digression."
3,Plot is secondary,"The year is 2276 much of the solar system has been colonized. Duncan Makenzie of the most important family of (Saturn's moon) Titan is traveling to Earth for the first time to partake in the 500th anniversary of the US declaration of independence, and also to clone himself to continue the family line (he is himself a clone).The plot is of minimal interest, it is just a vehicle for Clarke to expand on various ideas- cloning, living on Titan, space travel, the search for extra terrestrial life, mathematical puzzles and what Earth's culture and society might look like 300 years from now. These are all interesting in their way, but the novel as a whole suffers from a rather pedestrian plot. For fans of 'idea' science fiction only."
2,Plot Goes AWOL,"I loved the RAMA books, but I felt totally burned by this Clarke outing.Through the whole volume Clarke used the device of a mystery--raising motivational questions about the many underdeveloped characters (including the protagonist)--but then the book ended without resolving a single loose thread.If he was making some point about race (a theme so undeveloped that it baffled me every time a character's race was mentioned), I didn't get it.I didn't find the futurism especially novel, either (at least not as a reader in 2001--perhaps it was more exciting in 1976).The ending (and I use the term only because I ran out of pages) left me asking ""What the &%? Am I missing some pages?""--reminiscent of the film ending of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"".Unlike that film (or the Philip K. Dick stories I've read), the interest of the ride didn't make up for the unresolved storyline. It's easily the poorest of the 7 or 8 Clarke novels I've read."
3,"Slow and ruminative and, ultimately, not very interesting.","Actually somewhat less than O.K. given Clarke's reputation and the better SF books he has written, and I'd like to have given it a 2.5.Picked up this 1991 printing of what was apparently a book first published in 1976--and which has not aged well--off the free books rack at my local library.Among the more than 50 books written by Clarke are several very good works of Science Fiction; this was not one of them.""Imperial Earth"" was slow in pace and ruminative, and with a central mystery whose solution at the end was just not very interesting or exciting. Moreover, for all the wonders of 23rd century life it was supposed to display for readers, I found most such descriptions in ""Imperial Earth"" pretty bland and boring."
2,Least Favorite of Books on Statue of Liberty,"I just read through a large stack of books on the Statue of Liberty with my children (ages 2-9). This was my least favorite. The children in the story complain and whine, are disrespectful, and rude. I skipped over a number of words as I read this story. The information on the Statue of Liberty is minimal compared to many of the other enjoyable story books that we read. A few of the books we enjoyed more includeLiberty!,Emma's Poem: The Voice of the Statue of Liberty (Jane Addams Award Book (Awards)),Annushka's Voyage (A Play),You Wouldnt Want to Be a Worker on the Statue of Liberty!: A Monument Youd Rather Not Build, andThe Statue of Liberty (Step Into Reading: Step 2)."
5,Exellent,"This product was well assembled, is a good size and is a nice addition to our POM Orchard Cafe buffet area."
4,The White Sea Wolf,"The Journals of a White Sea Wolf provides interesting background source material for those intending to travel to the White Sea, Archangelsk, the Solovetsky Islands and Murmansk. Even those who don't plan to travel to the White Sea will find the book an interesting approach to Russian history."
4,Great summary of the lives of these great revivalists and evangelists!,I liked how Roberts gave some helpful advice at the end of each biography for our own lives. Great book!
3,Speak Lakota! Level 1 Audio CD,"This CD was for a teacher - someone far more advanced in the language than I am. I can see that it will be more useful when I can speak Lakota but for now it was not that helpful,"
2,Hard to follow,"The course is hard to follow even with the CD. You have to guess where the lesson starts and what they are saying since they dont use the english words before or after they say the Lakota word. The cd doesnt follow the book very well and jumps around on the page. It seems they assume you can speak the language already,"
2,Reasonable history but beware of Isaacson's bias,"This was a reasonable chronolgy of Franklin's life and description of his character. My main objection to the book is Isaacson's negativity regarding John Adams. I believe John Adams is one of the most underappreciated of our Founding Fathers. Isaacson did not miss an opportunity to add a negative adjective when discussing anything regarding John. These slurs were uncalled for and did not add to the book, unless to justify various aspects of Franklin's actions and behaviors. With this intensely negative bias against John Adams, I wonder what other opinions Isaacson interjected that, upon hearing a different perspective, I would find inappropriate and incorrect."
4,"A Complicated, Talented Figure","I didn't find this book as well written, -- or edited -- as the biographies of Chernow and McCollough about our Founding Fathers. But Franklin was such an incredibly talented, multi-faceted, totally original person OF HIS TIME. The author has most helpfully included at the end of this long book a list describing the major characters in Franklin's long life, as well as the important dates in his history. There is a lot to admire, such as Franklin's political savvy, and alot to be annoying, too, in his relationships with his family members. I most appreciated the parts about his dealings with the French government of Louis VI and the Treaty of Paris, which truly saved our necks. His blind spot was not foreseeing the French Revolution, duly noted by Isasacson"
5,"Franklin: patriot, inventor, statesman, diplomat, humorist","Benjamin Franklin has always held a special place in the hearts of Americans, and Isaacson's detailed and long biography helps to explain this perennial hold Franklin has had on our affections. It also helps to explain how a short, rotund, balding, `older gentleman' managed to surround himself with beautiful women all his life. His secret? He appealed to their intellect. Few of Franklin's many women were empty-headed beauties, but they were seen as such by other men. Franklin appears to have been far ahead of his time in appreciating a good brain within a pretty woman's head.No matter how much you think you may already know about Franklin, read this wonderful and eminently readable biography: you'll lean more.I guarantee it."
5,Franklin was ahead of his time,"Many of the reviews already give the praise to this book that I would give. As I kept reading I found it amazing that this man was actually born 300 years ago. Many of his views are still so relevant today. I kept finding myself saying, ""Yes, I totally agree with Franklin's opinion on that."" I can imagine Franklin living in 2007 and being fascinated with things like the Internet and communication. However, I bet he would be the type of person who would still find time to write a letter and sit back and relax with some friends and tea which we so often fail to do today. Great book!"
5,Readable and interesting,Walter Isaacson writes a readable biography that helps readers better understand Benjamin Franklin's life and the world he lived in and helped create. Highly recommend this book!
5,Huzzah!,"This may be the last word on Americana. Ben Franklin, perhaps like Isaacson himself, is a journalist...technologist... entrepreneur...politician who wants the best for his country and his time. His take on Franklin is a look into the soul of America, though Isaacson goes a little light on Franklin's philandering and cuts him a break on the veracity of his kite-flying experiment. But still, wow, what a read. It makes you wish we could live in the time of Franklin. At least we get to live in the time of Isaacson."
5,The Other Side of Ben Franklin,"When I took US History in College, the various instructors took pot shots at Benjamin Franklin, not really giving the poor old guy a chance. This book give a more balanced look at Ben's whole life and the events that changed his outlook on life. I still take to heart his creed to never speak sharply or argue in anger with anyone, speak softly and use reason to convince your fellow man (woman). This advice alone has allowed my to make headway in places that I would have never been able to before. This book also gives the reader the sense of sadness regarding Franklin's family, especially the very long time periods that he was away from his wife. Tragically, his wife died without him while he was in France. Franklin gave much to this country, I appreciate his contributions to this day and I read this book years ago."
1,not worthy of your time,This is a very boring book that is written in a way that will frustrate any reader.
4,Ben is human,"More than anything, Isaacson presents Franklin as human. There were faults with Franklin and there were virtues. For instance, how good was this Founding Father at being a real father, or husband, or friend?Without making judgements, Isaacson does a decent job at giving us this ""Franklin was human"" perspective that all icons deserve."
1,Incorrect Information,"I'm sure the 7 short stories by Agatha Christie are excellent as usual. The problem is that if you are looking for the Audio Edition read by JOAN HICKSON, this is NOT read by her. Amazon is listing that she reads it, but this information is incorrect. If you look carefully at the picture provided it shows that it is read by Geraldine McEwan. This may be a fine rendition, but it is not THE Miss Marple as performed by Joan Hickson in audio and TV performances."
1,Don't trust what this book tells you.,This book centers around the simplistic idea that calcium deficiency causes hundreds diseases that coral calcium canc cure. Calcium intake is an important factor in bone health and may play some role in the prevention of colon cancer. The authors have embellished these simple facts to create an elaborate scheme to promote the book as well as coral calcium products. Your best bet is to completely ignore what it says and follow a medically approved program that includes adequate calcium and other measures for preventing osteoporosis.
3,OK.....but....,"So...living in Vemont, I now take vitamin D. Glad I included two recipes in my book that are loaded with vitamins.The Oakhampton Comfort SocietyPen name: Roberta Hoy"
3,Beautiful Performance by All,"This DVD performance has a way of drawing you into the story so that you feel that you're on the stage with the performers. The singing and acting are superb but the quality of the recording is deficient. Camera angles and framing detract from the total enjoyment. Lighting is poor and obscure. If you want the feeling of sitting in the balcony watching the opera, this is for you. I, for one, don't want to be distracted by seeing more than what's happening on stage. Granted, the video/audio technology of the time is nothing compared to what we have today, but the amateurish camera work is independent of that. The performance deserved better treatment."
3,Not my cup of tea,I dont know much about this product it was a secret santa gift but i think its was what my secrect santa asked for so he was happy with it.
5,Definitely worth buying!,"I recently learned from a friend how Bach flower remedies could help with various health and emotional issues for both people and animals. I bought this book to learn more and have actually tried several remedies in this book as have my friends, co-workers and even my pets. The results are astounding. This is a great definitive guide for a beginner!"
4,"Very moisturizing, love it!","I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good."
1,an ego trip for Mr Urquidez,"Want to learn how to throw a punch? This isn't the book for you.Want to learn how to hit a speed bag? This isn't the book for you.Want to learn how to throw a kick? This isn't the book for you.But if you want to hear about how wonderful Benny Urquidez is, this is definitely the book for you."
5,LOVE THE ORIGINAL PINK FLOYD VERSION. BUT WHEN I SEEN TYHE RONNIE MONTROSE DID THE GUITAR ON THIS I HAD TO GET IT.,MANY PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER FOR THIS MASTER PIECE HISTORIC ALBUM A MUST IF YOU ARE A FLOYD FAN TUBES OR MONTROSE FAN.
5,aquatic life,"Ann Haven Morgan's Field Book of Ponds and Streams belongs in the library of anyone who pokes around in the water and wonders what those things are. It's over half a century old, but still a useful introduction for the young biologist."
4,shocked,"this is just quickly as a response for ""reader from new york"".quite honestly i was shocked with your response to a book about a woman who was held captive by her husband in a foreign country, along with her daughter.you obviously have no idea what it's like to worry about being kidnapped by your parent\husband.i know that if i was in mahtob's place id be afraid of meeting one on one with my father, and wouldnt be planning to anytime soon."
2,Seemed Enough,"Personally I feel that this book was nothing more than a follow up of the first. It wasn't a good read in my estimation, nor was it interesting, as was the first book. The first book seemed enough for the story being told. The second seemed to negate many of my view about the first and didn't seem to help the woman's image. For me it seemed to border on revenge and self-justification for personal choices and mistakes instead of a learning experience where the woman involved grew from her experiences. Didn't hold my interest."
4,LOVE IT! GREAT FOR THE MONEY,"AWESOME CRIB, GREAT FOR THE MONEY....i SHOPPED AROUND BEFORE i BOUGHT THIS ONE, LOVED THE STYLE, THAT IT CONVERTS TO TODDLER AND FULL SIZE BED, AND THE FACT THAT IS VERY SOLID AND STURDY.... i GAVE 4 INSTEAD OF 5 STARS BECAUSE WE HAD A HARD TIME WITH SOME OF THE SCREWS LINING UP BUT GOT THEM IN, JUST TOOK A LITTLE MORE TIME THAN EXPECTED TO DO IT, AND PUTTING A MOBILE OR CRIB TOY ON IS A CHALLENGE (BUT IT CAN BE DONE!) iT IS LOPSIDED, BUT IT STILL DID IT'S JOB : ) ALSO, PUTTING A CRIB TENT ON IT WAS A CHALLENGE TOO, i DO HAVE ONE ON IT, BUT THE TOP IS LOPSIDED BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN OF THE CRIB, BUT i WAS ABLE TO GET IT ON TIGHT AND SECURED. MY SON IS NOW 14 MONTHS OLD AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT."
3,Not a good choice,"I found this crib to be very sturdy and strong as opposed to many of the other cribs out there, however, my son was able to very easily climb out of the front of it at 33"" tall and 19 months old!!!! The lowest mattress setting is NOT that low, and due to the sloping sides and low front he could hurdle over the front of the crib with no problem. I feel he is too young to move into the toddler bed version, which is still pretty high off of the floor. We ended up turning the crib around, putting the low, front side toward the wall, and the high, back side facing out. The one end is against another wall, and we placed the changing table at the other end, allowing only a small space for us to put him in and take him out, but at least now he is safe. If I had to do it all over again I would NOT choose this crib. There are better choices out there."
2,READ THIS!!!! before you make something stupid like I did!!!,"Don't let the cover fool you and see the good and bad things of this movie:GOOD:* Beatiful colors and cinematographic.* Great acting.* Good story.* Cool cover.BAD:* HORRIBLE fight choreogrhaphy.* Sonny Chiba appear a few times and he only fight three times.* TO MUCH blah! blah! blah!This movie is supposed to be Chiba's biggest movie ever BUT NOT FOR ME, the Street Fighter trilogy is the best of him but is to bad that he didn't use a sword because that makes him look cool.Im looking foward to a Chiba movie that he use a sword to fight a bunch of people together... except for Karate Warrior witch was TERRIBE!!!P.S: Don't let the cover fool you and........well......don't let the cover fool you..........witch is cool.goodbye"
3,Fitting footing,"With Tubby's numerous studio releases and compilations, one can usually rest assured they are obtaining important and still relevant dub music, though listening full length, full time can prove repetitiously tiring. Fortunately most tracks here function easily enough individually, layering the milked template with enough diverse subtly to keep things classy in context."
1,New and improved with bonus prize inside...(not really),"Nothing new here-- only the ever-grinding gears of Dyer's perpetual marketing machine; he had some original things to say at one time, but at this point they've all been said. Just as well to re-read some of his old stuff than to waste good money and valuable time on the same content with a new cover."
3,same o same o,"I buy each new book because the man has some pretty interesting stuff to say, but it's the same to me in a different form. If you never brought his books, OK, you'll enjoy it. If you have, save your money. You've heard it before."
5,Wayne Dyer Inspires,This book is fantastic. It is a philosophy of how to live life to the fullest potential in-Spirit. I highly recommend it.
2,Not particularly inspiring,"Once a fan of Wayne Dyer's, I found this CD/book on tape to be with minimal exception disappointing. Although certain phrases in the first few chapters were truly remarkable, I thought that the whole read as a big love fest of Wayne Dyer himself. There were many times that I found it to be outright narcissistic. For example, when Dyer referred to himself as the reincarnation of St. Francis, I found that to be highly inappropriate. It is my opinion that this work is a wordy and uninteresting curriculum vitae of Wayne Dyer. It is an amassment of dropped names and quotations. Redundantly uninspiring for me...but perhaps inspiring for someone else."
5,Satisfaction Review,"This book is great, with an easy language can help you step by step to build your spirituality and heal your life, by doing so Doctor Dyer shares with you amazing real life stories that can inspire you to live a more simple and happier life. I can consider my good books, my most precious treasures and this book is one of them."
4,Easy Reading,"I love textbooks that are easy to read, and this one is, I breeze right through the chapters, everything is very easy to understand."
1,Clamps that will not open!!,"I purchased 2 of these clamps to help glue up a face frame. I placed glue on all the need parts, put the face frame together and then spent the next 20 minutes while the glue dried trying to get these clamps to open. I never sucessfully got either of the clamps open. This is apparently a common issue with these clamps and Jorgensen apparently unable to get a Quality Assurance department that can determine if a clamp can open before they ship them out. I recomend staying away from these clamps unless you can make sure they open first!"
3,Nice poster....but,"Its a great poster, but you can't get a poster frame of a standard size for it. I've had this poster sitting in the cupboard for 2 years as a result and have resigned myself to putting it on the wall with thumb tacks. So if you buy it, you'll likely need to get a custom frame that will set you back a good $80."
4,excellent,"Doesn't Fever Tree lead singer Dennis Keller remind you of The Guess Who's Burton Cummings? This was roundly confirmed for me the other night when I played ""Friends Of Mine,"" maybe the Guess Who's only psychedelic romp from Wheatfield Soul, next to ""San Fransisco Girls."" by this band.Both singers have a honey and growl that could have had them fronting any soul band. But unlike the Guess Who, this album by Fever Tree shows this band was less interested in the ballad or hit single to support their more rock oriented or experimental work.This album is a mix of organ and nicely arranged psychedelia from the early part of the musical era, when any style could be translated through phase shifters and strange echos. This music is pure acid rock--dated yes. But if you have worn out your copies of Surrealistic Pillow and Sgt Pepper and really want the acid under your nails, check this band out"
4,a comedy with insanity,"me myself and irene is a comedy wirth insanity. me my self and irene is a book with a great deal of comedy. the book is about a man who inherits two personalitys from holding his anger in and not dealing with it. he falls in love with irene, whom is a run away and gets him self involved. his two personalitys add a new twist to this comedy although at times its is just two much to handle. i recomend this comedy to anyone with great imagination and is in it for a good laugh."
3,Mission Adequate,"This worked well when it was working. But the cartridges cost nearly $100 each and it only lasted four years before it began to give phantom paper jams. And then the network interface died. So while it is working OK for the most part, it is no longer an Ethernet printer, and that is why we bought it.Locally there is no one who will touch a repair on a ""consumer"" product. I imagine that the cost of parts and labor exceeds the cost of replacing it.The overall cost of the printer including cartridges works out to about $200 a year. You can get a lot of copies at Kinko's for that price, but you would not be able to print stuff while in your jammies."
3,Good Multifunction - not for Mac,"I use Macs and PCs at home, as was able to use the printer functions on my Mac over the home network, but only while I was running OS 10.4. After upgrading to OS 10.5, I haven't been able to reach this printer with my Macs. It has worked flawlessly with our PCs from day one. I especially like that it can stay in standby mode and will wake when there is a print job."
5,Very nice bookcase,"I have 2 35"" Honey Oak bookcases. The seller packaged the items very well and they arrived in good condition. The shipping was also extremely fast. I ordered a folding bookcase because I move often and wanted something that is easy to take along with me. I was expecting a light, thin bookcase. The first thing that I noticed when lifting the package is that they are very heavy! On opening the package I realized that they are made of thick solid wood. They came pre-assembled and all you have to do is open the sides and lower the shelves. The bookcases are extremely sturdy. Once assembled they don't look like folding bookcases. The wood is thick and the finish is really nice, although as others have mentioned it is more like a cherry color rather than honey oak.In summary, this is the best bookcase that I have ever owned. If you are looking for a high quality folding bookcase, this is the one for you."
4,Nice piece of furniture. Well built.,"I bought this to add to my living room. My existing furniture is honey oak as well so it worked out perfect. The thing is built pretty well and looks great. I use it to store some containers that hold the wii controls as well as books. The shipping was prompt and the packaging was good. It wasn't that hard to assembly, probably took 20 minutes."
5,NOT the same as cheesy imports...,"This little saw is a quality piece. It's speed is half of others that I've owned and that alone makes it 1) last longer, and 2) much more controllable. Great for both tight places and thin sheet metal work."
4,Great job.,My wife and I have used this vacuum for 5 years and it still works great on our floors as long as you keep it updated and clean. We have had a few bumps on our walls probably due to my wife's aggressive vacuuming the only thing is that the reach cord is very short.
2,Hope your battery lasts,"Just bought this drill a few weeks ago (dec. 2006) I wanted to find out the cost of a replacement battery (for futute reference) Porter cable doesn't ""have any left"" there are two in dallas and mabe a few in detroit. Yes, this battery has been discontinued but the drill hasn't. No, there isn't another battery you can use (three different sources). So, why buy a great drill that you'll have to throw away with your ""drill master"" in two years, because the battery is beat? Your choice. Why two stars and not one? Because it is a very nice drill. Oh yea,spoke with porter cable they don't know why they did this.. Mabe it was the move to Taiwan"
1,Only 1 bib in the package.,"The picture and description appear to indicate two bibs are include in the package. In fact, there is only one bib for $9.99. The price is still not excessive, but the advertising is deceptive. I'm very disappointed."
5,Perfect,"Exactly how I remember it and at a great price. The packaging is a little different for this size compared to the last size I purchased, but it's a legit bottle. Great buy!"
4,Works great,The item was delivered timely. Had a chance to use it last weekend and it works great. I have other porter-Cable air tools and they are trouble free and work as advertisied.
5,A Wonderful Training Tool,"This is a very good basic video for EEO managers to use in workplace training for a general audience. Brian McNaught takes a very non-confrontational approach to his material, presenting gay men and lesbians as people who simply desire to be treated by the Golden Rule. He points out some of the common workplace problems, ranging from unintentional slurs to outright homophobic attitudes, that gay folk face on a daily basis, and suggests methods to eradicate the problem."
1,Yuck Joan Lunden's mustard chicken,"Oh, please do not try this recipe in Joan Lunden's Healthy Cooking. It's Samis Mustard Chicken which I just threw down the disposal. What a waste of what could have been good food. Bad Bad Bad my husband spit it out... I should have gotten the hint when above the recipe it says Sami was not one to spend alot of time in the kitchen. I decided to stick with my extra pounds tonight and order a pizza. Terrible combination of ingredients terrible recipe. Why did they include it???"
3,good item but slow delivery,The book was fine and in good shape. I bought it as a gift so I cant review the content. I had hoped to have it for Christmas (which I did not) and it seemed to take forever to get here.
2,Give us another Vertigo PLEASE,"The only reason I may give 2 stars to this album is because it has some nice music arragments & some interesting music sounds. Mecano music was the best at their time but the songs are dated and despite of the twist Fey gave to those songs they still doesnt cut it for todays music. The sales for her cd Vertigo may had not been the best but to give us this ""fuerza del destino"" after that wonderful ""Vertigo"" experience is far beyond unreasonable. Her voice sounds v good on this new record but the lyrics sounds dumb and after all nobody can sing them like mecano (I respect their music but I dont enjoy it). Please give us sequel to Vertigo Fey, we all know you can do much better. You cant trade quality and creativity for sales."
1,Father Christmas,"For anyone who saw the original I should STRONGLY warn you this is not. Whilst the animation is the same the voice and wording isnt. It has been Americanized and has lost all its charm and warmth. If possible I strongly urge you to find the original with Mel Smith. It is a shame that they couldnt leave it alone as it was one of the best christmas shows for children AND adults along with the snowman. Long live the REAL Father Christmas, we shall forever remember your warm voice."
5,The Snowman,This is one of the best Christmas classics ever. Father Christmas was not as good as the Snowman but there is a part when the two features merge and that's very cool.
4,Good book,"If you are a beginner or just read everthing like me, then this is a good book don't expect much."
4,Joni's Heaven made me anxious to get there.,"Joni writes in such a casual way, right out of her heart and mind, I just finished reading ""The God I Love"" and it really helped me get acquainted with her. Of course no one knows much about Heaven unless God has given them a glimpse but our Bible gives us enough information to know that it is going to be beyond our wildest dreams. Certainly anyone who has doubts about Heaven should read Joni's book. No one can truly imagine what all God has in store for those who love Him, but this book certainly touches that place deep in your heart where you know that ""HEAVEN IS A WONDERFUL PLACE, I WANT TO GO THERE!"
2,Bad switch connection,My wife's lamp didn't work - bought a new bulb - it didn't work - checked voltage between outer two pins and voltage was intermittent - checked pin connection to switch and it was intermittent - manipulated pin connection to switch until connection was solid - put new bulb in - it worked! - put old bulb in - it worked - reassembled lamp and both bulbs work - placed lamp in wife's hobby area and it still works - wife poured a beer for me!
1,not at all fresh,"This is straight baby powder smell. Not ""oh, smells like a baby!"" but very artificial, strong, powder smell. I only use it to spray in my daughter's diaper genie."
3,The adventure doesn't have to end.......,"I understand Ellisons' wanting to be rid of these characters. It's an old story, a writer or an actor gets caught up in a series or a role and, from then on, it's all the base wants from him. It happened to Conan Doyle, Basil Rathbone, Bela Lugosi, Milburn Stone, the list is endless. Doyle attempted to kill off Holmes at one point, but eventually brought him back.If Holmes could survive, so could Vic. Examine the situation carefully, and remember that it's taking place in a gritty, sci-fi world, which is heavily irradiated and in which mutants proliferate. So, we've got a teenaged boy, with a lot of emotional baggage, who gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Would death be the single, inevitable result? I think not!""Did he live? Listen, Bud,There he goes with his dog named Blood!""Face front, true believer! 'Nuff said!"
2,Alas More of the Same.,"Relating to Vol I of Mr. Allen's book, I stated:""Scripts and Strategies in Hypnotherapy, Volume 1"" by Roger P. Allen is a small work that provides a series of rather uninformative hypnosis scripts. This work seems to be more of the same.Of all the techniques I have used and read over the past 20 years, I have never seen such long and at times boring narratives. I was not impressed with the pointless metaphors which I believe a previous reviewer mentioned. Simplicity is at times much better in hypnosis than a complex and at times long and pointless story. Although the concept of misdirection may be used, the script should never be BORING.I was very dismayed to learn that I have paid so much for such a useless piece of tripe. Yes the best word to describe the book is terrible.Volume II is no better than Vol. I. It is just more of the same.Prof. Carl Edwin Lindgren, DEdHypnosis and BiofeedbackFormer, Fellow of the Royal Society of Health"
4,It was a hit!,My son loved his costume and was the cutest thing I have ever seen. It was not the best looking one I have seen but for a four year old it worked. Next year I may go with something a little more advanced than this one. It is very basic. I did need a little filing on the inside of the mask cause there where a few sharp pieces of plastic and I did not know that when my son put it on the first time. So it hurt him and right away I took it and felt around to find the pieces and grabbed a trusty nail file and went too it. So that would be my only piece of advice to someone buying it. Just check the mask and you'll be all good to go!
4,a little confused,"I was not aware that the costume ties around the waist, and does not have arms or a back, just a cape. Still, it worked well for my little Darth on Halloween."
4,Tantus Silk,"Not too big, not too small, lube it up with water based lubricant and its slippery, slippery, slippery. Cleans up easily. After a few sessions with back door play using this one we feel that we can probably graduate to the medium size. Key to comfort is plenty of lubricant. What we like about Tantus is that they use medical grade silicone, which makes them a little pricier over the competition, but its worth it IMHO. :)"
3,Brunton ADC Ridge Mechanical Altimeter,"This altimeter seems to work beautifully. Like most small mechanical altimeters; however, good vision is a must and it is hard to interpolate closer than (+/-) fifty feet. If accuracy or quick reference is a must; spend lots more money and get something with GPS capability and a digital readout."
4,Brunton Altimeter,Works well for the casual user - seems to match the elevation signs when we are headed up to the mountains from the desert valley. Gives us an idea of the elevation of our camp site and what weather we can expect based on that.
4,Good value for price,Product came quickly. It is operating as we expected and good value for the price. Earlier review we read indicated it is actually a barometric pressure indicator and that has to be considered to use it propertly.
1,Color on the cover but not inside,I bought this book for my mom who recently received a beautiful orchid plant. Anyone who has seen an orchid knows COLOR is one of the important factors in an orchid and to see the pictures in this book illustrated in B/W is a huge disappointment. The price was right but the product wasn't.
3,good book,"Good book, optimum status, author is well knowed and always attendible.Only more color photos could be better."
2,A horrible vacuum!,"I have been using an S12 vacuum at the clinic I work at since July and it is by far one of the worst upright vacuums I have ever had the misfortune of using. It is CONTINUOUSLY getting clogged on dust and hair! I have to turn it over and pull it all out and it ends up amounting to a wad of filth that's about the size of a softball. It has gotten clogged so bad before that there was particles backed all the way up through the hose and the bag was no where near full. The on/off switch is also inconveniently places as I am continuously hitting it by mistake and turning the machine off. I would not recommend anyone buy this vacuum cleaner, as you will get better results from even a cheap Dirt Devil."
3,Could Have Been Better,"This book could be useful to someone who has never used a slow cooker (Crock Pot or other brand) but for those of us who are looking for a collection of recipies to update our slow cooking repetoire, it is a disappointment.Although the authors give an excellent tip to brown all meats and some vegetables before placing them in the slow cooker, the majority of the recipies are not FOR the slow cooker, they are for using with components MADE in a slow cooker (stock, sauce, roasts). The section on the history of slow cooking and cookers, the section on food safety and the sections on recipies for meals from slow-cooked-stock or sauce could be replaced with more slow cooker recipies."
5,Dunkirk Cresando,"I bought used books, and they were in very good shape. I enjoyed the final book of this series and read it two times. I then donated the book to our church library."
3,It's Okay,"This is an average product. The first disc is pretty cool. It tells all about the human body. It has information on each of the bodily systems, the organs, the bones, etc. It also has a quiz to test your knowledge. The graphics on it are good, too. However, I was a little disappointed with the second and third discs. The second one is about the skeleton. It's alright, but it doesn't really have a whole lot of information that the first one doesn't have. The third disc is about the eye. It does have a little more information on the eye than the first one, but I found this third disc to be rather boring. The forth disc is a game for kids. In this game, one journeys inside the brain to search for memory chips and such. Overall, this is decent product for what you pay. If you can't find another one that doesn't cost a fortune, then I would recommend it, especially if you have children who will be using it."
3,Japanese AV Stars,"Overall, this dvd of Mao Misaki did portray what the title suggested ""Innocent Angel"". I would classified this dvd in the very softcore arena. It definitely shows off the softness of Mao and her personality...I wish I had an interpreter because she has quite an aura about her when she is speaking (lost a star-no English subtitle). I would recommend this dvd for a bachelor/cardgame party because it is done with refinement. The editing of this film needs improvement (lost a star). Recommendation is to buy this on the used dvd market."
5,a jolly good dose of conspiracy !,"Here is a good analysis of the the movie 300. Batty Yor wrote Eurabia in the1970's, and today many believe that Europe is indeed turning into Eurabia. Now here is a funny thing, in the town of Luton, UK, there is a king Fahd of Saudi Arabia high school (You-Tube it if you don't believe me)! There are many Saudi funded schools throughout England (not sure about the rest of Europe), and not just funded, but the Arabic sighs are still hanging over the front door. In the movie 300, the Persian king is using his vast wealth to bribe the Greek politicians. Is the Arabian king doing the same to European politicians? Is this a coincidence? I may need to get out more!"
4,Great!!,I have had this for a few years now and it still works absolutely great. I still have not used it to its greatest potential!!
5,Get a CLUE (Library Edition)!,"This classically constructed, well done game set is an excellent addition to anyone's game collection."
5,The Real Long Night,"Of all the Jajouka albums, this one either my first or second favorite. I like first of all the chance to hear the compositions in fuller, more fleshed out, form. Each is around 20 minutes long and includes an introduction, the main composition (usually with a sung text) and a section where the Musicians attempt to outdo each other with their variations and melodic/rhythmic inventions. Each of the three tracks is also in a different style, the first featuring stringed instruments, the second the flutes, and the third the raitas (oboe-like instruments). Each style articulates its melodies in different ways.But none of that would matter if the Musicians weren't feeling it, and they are feeling it very deeply here. You can tell that they are presenting the audience witnessing this concert with a true gift. At very least, it's their most joyful recording.The Master Musicians of Jajouka are planning a new release for later in 2004. Be sure to look for it."
1,A 3 Day Tent = FAIL,"I bought this tent expecting the Eureka! quality that I had in the past. I was mistaken and this tent is not worth the ""GREAT"" deal that is available. Do not purchase this tent if you plan on camping someplace else besides your back yard. I had it in Utah, Capitol Reef, and the tent was good the first day since there was no winds. By the third day and 25mph winds, the fly on the tent had ripped on both sides, to the point that if it had rained my trip would have been ruined. I followed the set up for that they had suggested with the eight string tie down but that did not work. The next morning when I woke up the center of the tent was sagging because the netting ripped from the pole clips in two seperate spots. Just a horrible tent, you will have better luck with an Ozark Trail for $40 then this POS for $130ish.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TENT IF YOU CAMP ANYWHERE THAT THE WEATHER MIGHT BE TO THE POINT THAT YOU NEED A TENT FOR SHELTER, IT WILL NOT HOLD!!!!!FAILURE ON EUREKA!"
3,The warranty sucks,"The poles cracked after being used several times. I can either send them the poles for inspection before they decide whether it is normal use or abuse, or I can buy them with $25+$10 shipping as fee. Not the kind of worry-free warranty as I expected."
4,drill accessories,"Before I had this set,I use to change bits by unchucking the drill and that use to take up a lot of my time.Now I have this set it makes my drilling and screwing operations easer.But there's a few problems I encounter with the quick change.The bits tend to wable quit a bit and that makes it hard to control.Nevertheless if it was'n for that problem things would go smother,but I enjoy using it and I give the set 4 stars for that problem.thanks amazon again for good service."
5,They dont like it up em misses tastic roy me old bath mateoh,"his album is BRILLIANT-OH! Skitzo are one of the mentalist bands to hear even if you have ears of closh. crazy guys german wrecking crew a belated bed knobs and broomsticks happy BUY this album, or live a life of shame...how COULD you face your mother every day if the Colonel's smiling face isn't emblazoned on your lederhosen-pyjamas? If you have read this far, you will probably like listening to the great skitzo crazy guys whilst you wear stockings and suspenders. This is quite natural, as most folk like to show off as they cavort imperially in the altogether...just us Germans (Deutschland, Deutschland Uber Alles!!!!) like to wear our mothers clothees! We simply love these crazy guys & a good old round of Edam cheese to go!TERMINAL DAMAGE IS THE BEST ALBUM IN THE WESTWORLD! EAT IT, BATHE WITH IT, BUT BEST OF ALL...LISTEN TO IT...MMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Resonated? Mmh,"My car exhaust is smaller than measurements mentioned on article. Anyway, I put this tip and I tested. Surprise, no resonated sound heard at all.In the other hand, it's a pretty nice tip, looks good, but....no resonated sound. It's a shame."
2,"good try, but not good","While I thought the opening prelude was really creative and well done, I found the acting over the top and the singing only marginal. There are much better versions out there, particularly (if you can find it on old LPs), the von Stade/Stilwell version. The jacobs/Fink version is pretty good, too."
1,BEWARE!,"My spouse and I were looking forward to a night of entertainment... what we got was only disappointment. If you are sensitive to nudity DO NOT SEE THIS. The OPENING SCENE has a man (whom I assume is Ulysses)in dim lighting completely naked. This is a prime example of why we should rate ALL media, not just films that make it to the theatres and video games. There is no doubt that Monteverdi was a genius but this interpretation may not be the best way for a new-comer to experience his art."
4,great artist and great cd,"I actually was surprised at how great this cd was, i am used to all the rnb artists all sound the same. this cd makes you pay attention to good talent.If you don't have it you should."
4,BILLY'S REVIEW PAGE,I REALLY LIKE THIS CD THE MUSIC REMINDS ME OF STEVIE WONDER AND HE HAS A NICE SOULFUL SOUND.
4,"Looks nude, but they come in black!","This ones looks to be nude, or white, but at least to me, they came in black.. sexys anyway"
4,Worth every penny...,"I just started doing furniture grade woodworking and could not get away with the brush & roller any longer so I gave this a shot and love it. I am using it with an undersized compressor but it is still working fine and putting down a great finish. As some have already said, there are few if any instructions besides the obvious so get out a large piece of scrap wood or cardboard and practice before you do the job. I've only used Alkyd paint so far and have been thining it with 4oz Penetrol to 1Qt paint on a 2.0nozzle which is not the one that comes standard. With the right size compressor, you probably don't need the larger tip. I am painting in a makeshift paint booth in my basement (tarps and dropcloths hanging from the joists) and get VERY LITTLE overspray which is great.I strongly strongly recommend it especially if you have a 30gal compressor and don't have a professional paint booth."
3,Spray Gun,"Purchased this spray gun to help finish cabinets I made for our home. Unfortunately I never did use the spray gun so can not comment on its operation, etc."
5,Just what I needed,Our original hose broke. This was the appropriate part to replace it. This installed easily and fits perfectly. No more leaks!
1,"Awful, scratchy inside",I have never written a review before but I felt compelled because this costume is deceiving. It looks soft and cozy and it's adorable from the outside but the lining is absolutely awful. It feels like sandpaper and there is no way it can be worn without something covering every inch of skin. Even the hat is scratchy. I'm going to try taking it to a seamstress and having a lining put in it because my daughter is obsessed with pretending to be a Dalmatian and was so disappointed in its discomfort. I don't know why anyone would create something so uncomfortable especially when it is to be worn against a child's sensitive skin.
5,The End of the Robots,"I really like this book. Daneel try to revive the steps of Elijah Baley, and with Giskard and Gladia, he will try stop Amadiro in their madness to destroy the future of Earth. Only these two Robots can save mankind of the extinction: Spacers by the hands of their own laziness and Earthmen by their fanatism for Earth. A great novel."
5,just as good the second time around,"reread this series by asimov in order. I had read the second book repeatedly but this one (#4) was a good, if different read, the second time around."
5,Gospel at it's best,"Another excellent gospel recording that was released back in 1994. In this writer's opinion, the best songs on the album are, Still in Love, Sure Won't Forget, No Turning Back, Til The End, featuring Kenny Latimore, and Be Encouraged. These songs received heavy rotation on Gospel stations during that period, and Be Encouraged crossed over to the secular R&B Charts."
1,Uninformed ranting,"This book is basically an uninformed rant by someone with no technical knowledge or any orginal insights of his own. If you want to learn about alternative ideas for the space program, you would be much better off reading the ideas of the space rebels who really do know what they are talking about, such as Robert Zubrin or Gerard K. O'Neill. These two, in particular, are also much better writers than Klerkx, and when you read their books, you can feel the optimistic passion that stands behind their vision. In comparison, Klerkx's book is a total dud. So try either ""The Case for Mars,"" or ""The High Frontier,"" and let ""Lost in Space"" pass on to its rightful destiny on the remainder racks."
4,NASA - Not About Space Anymore,"This is a decent book that presents the opposing view to NASA's perspective on space travel. It does get long winded at times and could benefit with some editing. It is corageous in that it is one of a very few books that will state that NASA is lost and has no real direction.I was born in 1968, so I missed the interesting space missions. I remember as a kid watching the first Space Shuttle launch and being completely unimpressed. I could never really put my finger on my fascination with the Apollo program and my boerdome with the Space Shuttle until now. This book has been a real eye opener for me as a space enthusiast and a tax payer!"
3,LOUD! It works well but it screams!,I am a VW tech at the dealership and this is way louder than the comparable mac and snap on air ratches. I have to use ear plugs. Functionally it is well build and works well. It is a little heavy though. It is a good price.
4,Just another school book.,"I bought this book for a college class. I really like the cover, I don't know why. It has some pretty good facts in it besides the same ol' polysci stuff. If I wanted a text book just to have about the US government, I would probably get this one. It wasn't a bad price either.(I bought it from a dealer)."
3,"Fun, but flimsy","I enjoy playing cards with interesting sets. I have some clear plastic cards, black and silver cards, etc. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll get a lot of play out of these Simpsons cards. They're pretty thin, probably thinner than greeting card paper, and not really coated with anything to protect them. The beer can is kind of fun, though, and the face cards are cool to look at. Just don't expect durability."
4,good,"The thermometer is accurate. The hygrometer senses the change of the humidity well. I am not sure if it's also accurate because I don't have other things to measure the humidity. Overall, I think this product is pretty good."
4,Only Fahreneit,The values are accurate and same with my other thermometers but it can only measure F.
4,Departure from most GU works,"I've been a long time GU fan, though I have to admit, I avoided the Barcelona mix, as I felt it would be too far off GU's progressive music focus. This mix is a deep and edgy bunch that really alternates between jiving to some dark bass lines and them some outright classic ""smilers"" on the second disc.Not sure why they would allow James to mix in the same track ""In a State"" twice on the same comp. It's a beautiful track, but I pay good money for these sets - not to hear duplication."
3,Is a grayer green,"Second SS too-short-for-LP-too-long-for-EP release turns the pace up a bit, but merely excels at condensing some pretty elements found more vibrantly in other groups. While post rock enthusiasts may scoff at a second-rate quality, its earnestly clean delivery ensures beginners a welcoming launching point."
4,Gone Nuts,"I love McCammon's work. When I picked up Gone South, I was under the impression it would be something dark, gritty...something that might make me hold my breath through a few eye-popping paragraphs of horror or near-horror. What I got was totally unexpected and delightfully welcomed...Gone South is weird! Not quite weird like most of McCammon's books are, but delightfully, touchingly, wacky and weird, and chock full of action and surprises! This should be made into a film simply because it would be the oddest buddy film ever. From page to page you'll have no idea what to expect next, and the whole thing plays out like a fantastic roller coaster ride. Bizarre. Bittersweet. Laugh-out-loud. Shake your head in wonderment. Read this book!"
4,Entertaining!!!,Excellent characters. Smart and funny. I don't have fifteen more words to meet your quota on words required for this review. Take it or leave it.
5,Gone South,it was a very thrilling good book. Very enjoyable reading. Hard to put down. I would recommend this book to all.
2,It's a mistake to kill off the dog!,"No doubt the author is brilliant, and I adore his work. Unfortunately, as a person who is very sensitive to animal welfare, I was unhappy with the extremely graphic and violent scene toward the end of this book, wherein the sweet companion canine is eaten by a beastly human character. It completely marred my reading experience. Mr. McCammon also terminates dogs in at least two of his other books: Boy's Life and Swan Song. Hmmmmm...makes me wonder what past experience(s) may have been responsible for his doggie death wish?!"
5,An Inspiring Movie,Peaceful Warrior was just the message I needed to hear and see at the time after having come through my own health crisis. This is an inspiring movie I will watch again and again as I share it with friends who are ready on their spiritual journey.
2,Disappointing,"I've read Dan Millman's books (Peaceful Warrior series) and found them inspirational. I was really looking forward to the same when I sat down to watch the movie last night. Unfortunately, there was a lot left out and too much added to make the movie more palatable to the mass market, I suspect. The movie is not about one man's spiritual quest as is the book, but about achieving top honors in an athletic event (and keeping your good buddies along the way), which has been done before, over and over again. The ending was really stupid and very disappointing. Also, though I love Nick Nolte, I think he was poorly cast in this role. He doesn't deliver spiritual truth with any crediblity and mumbles a lot.I've noticed that most of the good reviews seem to be from people who haven't read the book, so the one good thing I can say is that maybe this will inspire them to read it."
4,Interesting movie,"The screenplay was given an interesting twist by putting a sort of mystical character in it played by Nick Nolte. An arrogant young man who thinks life is all about his own glory and completely self-absorbed is changed when he's in a motorcycle accident and can't compete at the Olympics. He meets an older man who is content to work at a gas station and seems to have deep insight to share with the stubborn athlete. The attendant seems more ghost than human, giving the movie a surreal flavor. I found the story motivating since it was inspired by true events, but it's easy to tell in some places that they twisted the truth for dramatic effect. I'll have to read the book as well.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,All I have is here and now,"This movie will leave anyone empowered and inspired. It effectively delievers the awakening journey of a young gymnast in the midst of self-discovery. He discovers that the ultimate master is within, a message we can all benefit from. This movie remains loyal to the essence of the book, although a lot of excellent insight is left out. Read the book for more wise words from Socrates."
5,All we really have is now...,"Who hasn't occasionally wandered off onto an unknown path on this journey we call life? This is a wonderful movie about a young man who does just that - he walks down an unfamiliar path and gets lost before he can find himself again (I can relate). Socrates, the mystical mentor, imparts some powerful, invaluable life lessons that will likely speak to each person who watches this movie. It was a good reminder that all we really have is now, this moment. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice, something I rarely do."
2,Way of the Peaceful warrior (DVD),"A poor adaptation of the novel. Scott Mechlowicz as Dan is brilliant. Nick Nolte as Socrates was a disappointment - to me he came across as lethargic and uninspiring.Dan's anger and frustration in the film is palpable and you get a sense of what drove him to search for inner meaning to his life. This search is powerful and moving. What the film misses are the ""shift"" moments - moments when Dan realises/discovers/experiences the teaching of Socrates, for example living in the now, ""dying"" and being reborn as a new man etc.I got more out of the bonus features than the film."
3,Disappointing - needed to be more like the book.,I'm assuming if you are buying this DVD you've read the book. We always hear that a movie is never as good as the book; rarely does that not hold true. In the case of this movie it holds true! I found myself saying at the end - is that it? I wanted much more. Sorry Dan.
3,Peaceful Warrior Movie doesn't live up to expectations...,"The movie would be ok if you have no experience with the Peaceful Warrior books. The movie changes the storey just enough so those not familiar with the story are not getting the full messege. There is lots of eye candy in this movie and even Nick Nolte cleans up well for his roll as Socrates, but do yourself a favor and read the book in order to grasp the whole story."
5,Outstanding and awesome,I have seen the movie and read the book so many times and everytime I find it inspiring. looking forward to its DVD release. a must own becuase you will be watching this movie again and again.
5,A new Rocky for 2007,"This is an inspirational story. If you need a lift in sprit and motivation, I highly recommed this movie."
5,Psaltys praise party,Great for sharing with the kids and provides easily understandable gospel messages for children and adults as wellI would recommend this to all families as a must see
5,For a good laugh,"If you want glitzy special effects look elsewhere. If you enjoy a good belly laugh from the absurd this may be your title. One of those ""cult"" movies you will watch more than once."
5,"Arrived on time, saved money",I saw this at one of the stores at an outlet mall. They wanted $40+ and you got a deal if you ordered another one. I do not like those silly games. I got this at a good price. It was delivered on time. What more could I ask for?
3,"Needs improvements, but going the right direction.","The buzz, that is created by the speakers at low volume, is very noticeable. If the volume is turned up high, and you are not within 3 feet of the speakers, it isn't detectable. Music sounds fine, but talk shows are uneasy on the ears due to the humming background noise. There is a headphone input on the box that will allow you to attach powered PC speakers. I did this and it sounds wonderful, and the buzzing, humming noise is no longer present. I bought this boombox to take on camping trips. Every campsite that we go to has electrical outlets so the boombox paired with the powered PC speakers is an excellent alternative oppossed to the crummy mountain AM/FM stations. I look forward to an improved version of this Boombox."
2,hum noise,"it makes a low humming noise. if you listen loud enough, you won't hear it, but at low volume it's annoying. also, when it is ""off"", then you still hear the hum."
4,Nice Boombox,"Boombox is nice, light weight, easy to move around. We got an antenna error and discovered (after much frustration and no help from Delphi or other merchants) that you must have the batteries in the unit even when using the plug for power. This eliminated our antenna error. But once that problem was solved, we love the unit!"
2,The NOISE is awful,"As others have mentioned, this product suffers from noise that makes it unusable. The noise comes from the boombox, not the receiver. I am adding this review because not everyone reports this problem and I think I know why it occurs. The 'Troubleshooting' section of the manual states that noise may be due to the following: ""Someone is using a portable telephone or other equipment that emits radio waves near the antenna (~2.3GHz)."" Hmm- what do you know, 2.3 GHz is the frequency range of WIRELESS ROUTERS. How do I get away from those? Bollocks.UPDATE: The noise is NOT due to 2.3GHz. Noise persists even far from 2.3GHz sources (i.e. away from buildings on the interstate). I think it's obvious there is a prevalent defect in these units. I'm planning on insisting on a replacement until they get it right."
1,Wow. I should have listened to the reviewers...,I ususally put a lot of stock into reviews but I discredited the people complaining about the background noise on this unit. Boy was I wrong. It really is very annoying. Mine is the combination of a chirp and a constant noise that I can't explain. But it is a serious annoyance.(...)
2,"BEWARE, Not made to last...","Boombox was ok right of the box. The problem is the unit is poor quality. My unit has never even moved off my desk since its purchase. Here we are 7 months later and the sound has quit working. Delphi warranties the thing for a year, but its a big hassle. They should just exchange the unit right away. You just can't go turn another radio on when you using satellite."
2,No Satisfaction,"I received the bell quickly, although the bell was sent in a plain mailing envelope with no packaging so the box was totally smashed inside the envelope. Because of the complete lack of packaging, the bee design on BOTH sides of the bell was flattened. The bell itself was bent slightly, which effected the sound. I emailed the company immediately with no response to this day. I would not order from them again."
4,Future Mom of Chinese daughter,A very compelling and touching story. As we wait for our China Baby this was helpful to walk through the process of others and give hope that our day will come too.
4,not the most comfortable,I bought this for my leg that has been giving me problems of late. This was recommended by a therapist but I must say that it's a little tight and uncomfortable and it tended to slip down my leg with movement.
5,A MUST READ for any single woman thinking about becoming a step mom,"I have read this book many many times this past year and every time I laughed and cried and learned many new things as if I just read it for the first time! This book is very realistic and straightforward in spelling out the challenges for a single gal who is a new stepmom, or having a serious relationship with a divorced man with kids (which is my case). However, it is not depressing or discouraging but rather uplifting when discussing these challenges, whether physical, emotional, or financial, and how to face them with a positive attitude and grace! Since I can identify with many of Sally's stories and situations, reading her advice helps me to be more understanding and patient in my relationship. It makes me want to be a good stepmom & wife...some day!"
2,"single girls guide to marry a man, his kids and his ex wife",This book gave situations that come up that can happen but not suggestions on how to deal with them. this book didnt do me much good.
2,DOA,"Large flask with decent weight, initially looked like quality. Bottom is not flat, it will teeter when standing upright. Screwed the top down fully but a small leak between cap/flask was noticed when tilted upside down. Not a big deal if it's always upright (note the teetering) but if you have it in a bag, it might leak over your stuff. Maybe I just had a busted flask? I processed a return through Amazon."
2,Not that great,"This works pretty well, when it is actually working. Unfortunately, it stops working after about a week and then I have to take it down, reset it and then start it again. It is also completely incompatible with water, which is annoying."
4,A Very Good Historical Book,"I've enjoyed God's Generals II very much. There is a lot of history contained within it's pages. I have learned a lot that I didn't already know so I can say it is definitely worth reading. I did, however, enjoy God's Generals I more, but I think much of that has to do with the fact that it was more modern generals. Anyway, I recommend you get it."
3,Good saw but with a few important issues,"I've used this saw for about six months now and was happy with it initially. The saw is accurate and easy to use.My problem is with the blade brake which began failing after about three months. The problem seems to be related to the trigger switch because I can sometimes get the blade brake to work by clicking the trigger once or twice. I've contacted Hitachi but haven't heard anything back yet. Hopefully, they'll step up and fix the problem in some way other than asking me to send the saw to them for a month or so to get it fixed.The second issue is a feature that's missing. The saw only tilts one way. When doing crown molding, it's very convenient to have a saw that tilts both ways, rather than having to move the molding to the other side of the saw. Delta has a saw that is just a bit more expensive than this Hatichi which offers dual tilt - If you're looking for a saw now, I'd recommend the Delta over this Hitachi."
5,Great Movie,If you like Klaus Nomi even a little bit you will love this documentary. Klaus lead a short but a very interesting life. The end was tragic for Klaus.
4,To know him is to Love Him,"He truly was ahead of his time and gone too soon. A mix of pop,new wave, opera and classical stylings that we have not seen since. He needs to be seen as well as heard and I recommend this DVD if you already love him or want to know more about him."
4,They Run Narrow,"I have a narrow foot and ordered a 7N as I normally do. They were very tight and I ended up finding a 7M instead...which was as comfy as a glove. I have to say as sandals go, that at least this style of Clarks, runs narrow. Order up. I rated it with 4 stars only because I was disappointed I had to spend the money to mail them back. They are a 5 once I got the right fit."
2,Far from deluxe,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the internal black casing is terrible. Weak plastic, and it does not fit the case. If you are buying this because it is a deluxe set - especially for the wooden case - look elsewhere. Otherwise, the tools seem OK."
2,TALKING BRATZ CLOE -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is basically a flimsy Cloe doll on a precarious plastic stand. If Cloe's feet are positioned just right, the doll will utter some sentences and your child has to hit a button to keep the conversation going. My daughter was bored pretty fast with this toy.Also, it was shipped by a 3d party Amazon vendor and the package seemed as if it had been opened before. The package was pretty worm looking and the tape looked as if it had been resealed. It even had someone's gross hair under the tape. I thought about returning it but got busy at work and just didn't bother to do so. Probably should have and gotten a more interesting (and brand new) toy."
5,Stone People Medicine,"I found the book to be incredible. It was a simple method, informative and definitely put a different perspective I had never seen before. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in getting insight from the Native Spiritual perspective. The packaging itself is worth the price. A beautiful cigar-type box, looks like it is wrapped in leather - very nice. Excellent, from cover to cover."
1,not good,"This work is NOT based on a system similar to the tarot or the I-Ching, it was made up by the author, a fact he mentions in the introduction.The final page notes that one can buy stones from the author for [price] plus postage. What a [....] This type of book is precisely the reason why people don't respect new age theories."
2,barnyard blocks,"While these are very cute, i was disappointed when i received them. This could be due to the fact that i didnt read all the information listed about them completely, i dont know. Anyway, my thinking was that i was going to receive blocks for each letter of the alphabet with animals inside the blocks representing those letters. I was sorely disappointed & upset when i received them & only had the animals pictured above. My son didnt even want to play with them on top of that. Like i said, maybe i didnt read the description very well, but will not purchase any other of these type blocks again. I had seen (around Christmas time 2009) at Target, an entire set of these peek-a-blocks (they were not the barnyard, but other types). i didnt purchase b/c i had already gotten my son's Christmas gifts so i was super excited to find them on here. Guess i should have just bought the ones at the store anyway"
2,Just so so,"Compared with the sound sensation blocks I bought together to my 3-month babies, This product is almost ignored by them."
5,Awesome,"I couldnt wait to get my hands on the new He-Man. He is alot stockier then the old one, and more poseable. An all around excellent toy whether your just getting into Master of the Universe or if you've been a fan since the 80's. The only I dont like is how his shiled is held, its not that tight fitting, but a minor complaint at best."
1,Socks too tight!,"I love frogs and was excited to find a pair of socks with frogs. I put them on and wore them to work. Within an hour I had to take them off because they were digging into my ankle. I pushed them down to the smallest part of my leg but it did not help. I don't know if this was just a manufacturing defect on my pair or if that's the way they all ship, but I had to take mine off and go buy another pair of socks to get through the day."
3,Pax: fun read for the young fantasy fanatic,"Pax is a great fantasy story that is well-suited to the recommended age group. It is an tale of epic proportions in a small package, with enduring lessons of loyalty and courage as well as dashes of humour and romance. If you love Tolkien, you'll find this book interesting and far more accessible to the younger reader. My main complaint is that there is probably too much of Tolkien in it, I'd rather have seen a more original setting and story. It's a good start for a new author."
5,Teacher taught to teach reading,I am a teacher and this book is awesome. It goes write to work teaching me to help my child learn to read. The lessons are fun and easy to use. My child is reading and it has been painless for us both.
5,Teaching reading's not that tough,"I've only used this book for a week--gotten through just the vowels--and so far I love it. Each lesson is short, but includes plenty of repetition to help you child hear and remember the letters sounds. And the use of poems and other techniques are working--after just 5 days, my son is confident about the short vowel sounds. The lessons are completely scripted, giving the instructor the exact words to say, along with instructions about things to show or write down for your child and suggested responses from the child. We tried the 100 Lessons book for teaching reading and found it confusing and a little awkward. This one is super straight-forward and easy to follow."
5,Excellent,"Started using this about two month ago with my 2.5 year old son and have had amazing results (since he's so young we do each lesson 2 times before moving on so we end up doing 2-3 lessons a week). Since we started he now knows all the letter sounds and points them out and says them when he sees them in books, on signs, etc. He's even using letter magnets to make and read short words on the fridge (like dad, mom, cat). At this rate he'll be reading books in just a few months!Very easy to use format that makes teaching your child fun for both of you. The short lessons are also excellent for the short attention span of young children (each lesson takes 10-15 minutes)."
5,Happy Homeschooling Mom,"After recently reading The Well-Trained Mind, I immediately checked this book out from the library which was suggested for teaching your child to read. Once reviewing the book I ordered it from Amazon. I am homeschooling my 5 year old son. I am a certified teacher, but at times feel inadequate about teaching my own child. This book provides a strong, systematic phonics approach to teaching reading. A must have for anyone wanting to teach their child to read."
5,The best 4th available today.....,"Szell was a great conductor ranging from Mozart to Mahler always giving great interpretations. His 4th is a grammophone classic and is highly acclaimed by each and every critique written on it.The 4th is the ""mellower"" of all Mahler's symphonies and with Szell on the pontium you can feel it. Raskin is an excellent soprano for the Sehr Behaglich although for this part I would still go with Schwarzkopf's account (Emi Classics with Otto Klemperer). This CD is not only giving the best account of the Fourth but also an excellent account of the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with Frederica Von Stade and Andrew Davis. The least I can say for it, is that it can easily stand with the very best accounts available today though it can not match the Fischer-Dieskau account with Furtwangler on Orfeo."
4,"Thought-provoking, masterful, epic----and long","War and Peace is perhaps the grandest novel ever written. Leo Tolstoy condenses or hollows out none of the grace and majesty of the Russian royalty, and the characters are more than human enough to learn from, and to argue with. Throughout the 1456 pages, the main characters struggle with who they are and what they believe--and everpresent in the background is Napolean and his apocalypse with the Russian people. War and Peace tries to be a philosophical novel about history, but it is really a philosophical novel about people, about morals, about what to die for--and what to live for. It is as provoking and beautiful as it is challenging. And long. Does it take 1500 pages to write a novel that will stand the test of time? No, but it takes 1500 pages to write War and Peace."
4,A great classic.,"Leo Tolstoy's writing is something that cannot compare to the writers in this lifetime. He manages to write a long book such as War and Peace and keep the writing so wonder and clear.The writing of Russia and war would not have normally kept me reading, but something in this book pulled me into and would not let go. I start to feel like I was right there in Russia with the characters and I was seeing Russia as it was.Each of the characters was painted a real person with real feelings and each character was writing as that. You get to feel like you felt the hurt when the characters did and you felt the happiness when they did.This book has been reviewed a lot so I will not go into the story of the book, but I will tell you that this was a such a great book. It took me just under a year to read this, but I am happy to say that I read this book and would recommend it to people who are looking for a book to read that will make you feel emotions."
2,IT DON'T COME EASY,"When I was a little girl, Ringo was my all time favorite Beatle (and I was a major Beatles FAN)! For years I hoped a good, comprehensive biography of the world's most famous drummer would be published, so I naturally expected this book to fit the tab.Wrong! It is written in a rather pedantic, condescending tone and offers very little in the way of new information. Instead of treating Ringo with respect, the author appears to trivialize the major obstacles Ringo had to overcome to attain the level of success that he did.Although I was very disappointed by this book, I am glad to see that Ringo is getting more coverage. My suggestion? Skip this. Read the Beatles' ""Anthology"" instead. You'll be glad you did."
2,Buyer beware,"Sir Thomas may have been a great hand as a conductor, and the BBC may be a great orchestra, but they needed a better sound engineer. Recorded in the 1950s, this is MONO and is of historic interest and lacks sound definition in a world where people expect clear sound on a recording. That is, there is a muddy quality to much of it. Bravo, composer! Boo, sound engineer."
4,Good item,"This holster is so much better than the nylon/velcro pouch I had before. I do not have to loosen my belt to attach the holster since it has a loop with snap that goes over the belt. The fit is tight and I have no problem with the flashlight falling out. Best of all, the flashlight is quickly and easily accessible with no velcro flap to get in the way. My only complaint is the snap is a very tight fit and is difficult to snap sometimes. I think this will improve with constant use."
4,Grealt Mini Maglight holder,"The mini maglight holder is great and made of quality leather. I use it to hook through my belt loop, because I don't wear a belt. It snaps at the end and holds the mini flashlight securely in place."
2,A Quest For Life,"frankly, I have not read the thing. I was rather put off by th implausible price the author put on this story of his life. It makes me think the fellow has a rather overblown image of himself...that and a self-defeating degree of greed when ge priced this book."
5,Surprised,The original setting of this book has been out of print and still hard to find the new one. So excited to find it for my grandson! Amazon seems to be the solution!
3,drum set,Did not come with symbols.. It is okay for the money. Ludwig is a great brand but this one is very entry level.
2,paperweight,"This product works excellent with a mac, windows 7 is not compatable at this time....I can't believe windows sucked me back in...this is my windows 7...still useless...fix that!"
1,Save your time and money,"If you are looking for a shallow book about the life of a model, MTV host and celebrity name dropper, this is the book for you. If you are looking for insight into life with Sarcoidosis, look elsewhere. As a person living with sarcoidosis, i hoped this book would have more insight into actual life with the disease. Instead we are taken into Duffs very self absorbed life, her famous friends, and her vanity driven antics. This book should be retitled ""Life as a model, celebrity date, and MTV host. And by the way, a little about my Sarcoidosis""."
2,"entertaining for a chapter or two, BUT...","I have sarcoidosis, too, and kept waiting for the page she'd finally shut up about herself and make a difference by informing people about the disease. The writing is good and funny but there's so little substance I wondered, ""Don't people have better, more important things to do with their time than read this?!"""
1,"Don't waste your money, donate it to Sarcoidosis Research","I am a Sarcoidosis sufferer and know first hand what it is like to have this dibilitating disease. Karen Duffy's book is not about her disease it is about how many dates she had and who she hung out with. She talks about how this disease effected her life in terms of her ""dating meter"". She tells of the pain but not without dropping a few celebrity names first. I think she just wants people to know who she is not what she has. If I had to do over I would not buy this book I would instead donate the money to SARCOIDOSIS RESEARCH. Write to National Sarcoidosis Resource Center PO Box 1593 Piscataway, NJ 08855-1593 to find out how you can help. Take it from a woman who has Sarcoidosis I know what I am talking about."
3,"Decent, with its minor flaws.","The holster does indeed hold the mini maglite firmly and securely. My complaint is that the whole holster comes off my belt if I try to draw the flashlight with one hand. The back is velcro as well, and is kind of flimsy. It works, don't get me wrong. It just is not made to be a strong flashlight holster."
1,Kindle edition is poor quality,The other reviews have addressed the content in some detail. Readers are warned that the Kindle edition of the book is of poor quality. Text appears to have been scanned without proper conversion. Unlike other Kindle books legibility is poor and text scalability is limited. This is really unacceptable and should be an embarrassment to the publisher.
5,Contents of book,"Austin, here are the stories in this book:1. Beyond Lies the Wub2. Roog3. Paycheck4. Second Variety5. Imposter6. The King of the Elves7. Adjustment Team8. Foster, You're Dead9.

5,A feel good toe-tapper,"A long-time favorite on my ""Songs That Make Me Happy"" playlist.The song is catchy and sticks in your head, in a good way. I have a 5-month old daughter and for the life of me cannot remember lyrics to the baby standards, so I make-up my own: ""Hush little baby/Don't you cry/Momma's got a headache/She needs a glass of wine."" She doesn't find it as amusing as I do (maybe too much wine? ;-) Yesterday this song popped in my head during play time and was met with gushing giggles and wiggles. It has a positive message. It is fun to sing.Where can I find more from Par Trick?"
3,A pleasant surprise,"Okay, so based on the cover, I really didn't have high hopes for this story. But it had some great reviews, so I thought I'd give it a chance. For a change this book proved the old adage right: one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I truly enjoyed the story. I thought the characters were reasonably well developed with interesting and believable emotions. And Laura Leone's writing was above average for the romantic fiction genre. I would highly recommend this book to readers who appreciate a little grammatical clarity and plot-line novelty with their sex scenes :)"
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"This textbook is 45 years old, so maybe it doesn't matter anymore, but Author Gucker makes a mess of the present perfect and the past perfect. Buyers and readers should disregard what is written on these two important tenses."
4,Flags for my daughter,I got these flags in a matter of 3 days. My daughter was so excited! only issue I had was the quality. I thought they would be more sturdy. They are more like a silky material. All and all though. I was happy as well as my daughter.I would order through this seller again as the service was FAST and it was a great deal!
3,"OK for the price, but not the best quality flag","The price was decent for it's size. Similar flags this size can run you upwards of $15. The only thing is that it's not the best quality. The Union Jack is printed on to the fabric and mine happens to be slightly lopsided. The lines that should be parallel slightly drift to one side. I'll probably end up purchasing a higher quality flag next time. Nevertheless, it's a good, cheap decoration for my dorm room."
4,Bargin!!,"Good flag for price,shame it wasn't magic and made England play better in World cup!!! Arrived on time,thanks."
4,union jack,"I use flags as curtains in my dorm room. This looks cool as long as you're not looking too closely, it's pretty cheaply made. It's fine for indoor use but I don't think one would last very long outside."
1,Don't waste your bucks,"Don't waste your bucks on this, it is some guy talking about his experience in Nam. No action and not footage, just some guy talking. Not even an hour worth of show. Certainly not worth $24."
1,Not as advertised,"I ordered this item and was sent a minimag holster, although not in the camo pattern as shown online. [...] informed me that Maglite switched camo patterns, and the websites have simply not updated their images yet. Be warned when ordering this item that what you see is not necessarily what you get."
4,It's different in a good way...,"Except for LSP, which is better than the Amnesiac version, this EP is probably not for the casual Radiohead listener who wants to hear studio perfect sound. With that said, most hardcore fans will enjoy it very much for the different takes on familiar songs, primarily from Kid A and Amnesiac. I personally like the live versions because of the raw and more authentic feel of the songs. Real life doesn't unfold in a recording studio, and sometimes a song has more impact when the artist's voice isn't perfect. If you don't agree, then you might want to pass.Now a question: Why do people buy an EP and complain about its length and track selection? Here's a tip: Read the label before buying."
5,TRUE LOVE WAITS..,"FIRST--if you have an open mind to music, disregard the reviews of PILPOL--He obviously doesn't understand that music isn't always about perfect pitch or tone. Sometimes portraying the emotion of the music and lyrics is more important. That is one thing that Radiohead excels at, and if you don't get it--you probably can't appreciate Radiohead--so stop trying...I'm not what I would call a DIE HARD Radiohead fan, but I do really enjoy them. I have listened to at least parts of all of their albums, and True Love Waits is a song that really surprised me. From the title you would assume that it's a love song, but it's really more of a codependent theme song.Live Thom Yorke's voice is definitely not perfect, but I tend to like the live tracks because I can almost feel the emotion that comes through his voice. There are many Radiohead songs that have brought me to tears more than a few times... It is multilayered music that never seems to get old. :)"
4,Worth the price for True Love Waits,It's a rare song. They play it less often then they play Creep. The album is too short for a live album. Considering that they usually play for over 2 hours. At the time of this review the album is $5.00 on the mp3 store. Very good deal.
5,Never thought I'd say this...,"...but, Radiohead is amazing live. After hearing Kid A for the first time, i thought they'd never be able to pull any of it off live. I was wrong. The live version of ""Idioteque"" is, in my opinion, better than the studio version. Far better. The live ""Like Spinning Plates"" sounds nothing like the studio version from Amnesiac, but is also much better, the keyboard part in that song alone is worth the price of the album. Topping it all off is the previously unreleased track ""True Love Waits"", a beautiful acoustic guitar/vocal only piece. If you are into Radiohead at all, buy this, even though its mostly stuff I thought I'd never hear live, Radiohead does it, never ceasing to amaze."
2,Handy booklet for women shoppers from Hong Kong,This little booklet focuses on Shenzen's shopping areas and the sort of products a woman might might want to buy. Pity it has so little information for men.
1,"Disappointed, only 79 pages and not enough info. on each des","I was under the impression that there would be a lot of info. to read on each destination (not just one page per destination). The reading that was provided seemed to me like it was written by a ""travel agent/realtor"" trying to sugar-coat the articles.(BOORING) Thats what I get for being impulsive. PS. Beautiful pictures, but still not worth 12.60sincerely, Dan"
2,Deceptive advertising,"The DPH-540 works well enough at home if you have a wireless network. I am hoping it will work if I find a kind person during my travels who leaves their network open. However, it will never work at a wireless hotspot unlike it's advertising on the D-Link website where it shows the Wi-Fi phone connecting to a hotspot. Reason? It simple does not have a web browser or java script capable of logging in. According to tech support: it never will.Without this functionality its more a toy than a phone with real communication capability."
4,Excelente trabajo,Es una gran demostración de constancia y de amor por llevar a término un objetivo planteado hace más de 40 años.
5,Thought provoking,"The initial concept was facinating. What do 7 year olds think? And, if there's a follow up, how did they change? But as I continued to watch the ongoing series I became more thoughtful than facinated. Had the cameras invaded my own life how would I respond? Defensive? Apologetic? Would my life's decisions change knowing that those cameras would return for yet another accounting? It made me wonder, too, at the price of celebrity and why anyone would aspire to such a thing. Social interest started the series - introspection kept me rivited to the end."
3,It Seems Good,"I saw this DVD get two thumbs up on Ebert and Roeper today, so I decided to check it out on Amazon.com But really why would I pay 75 dollars to get this? It is interesting but that is just way too much to spend."
4,Very Very Good (4.5 Stars)...,Have a couple RHP albums...but think this may be better...the highs are definitely higher...The first three songs are absolute knockout punches (as far as folk goes)...Definitely Neil Youngy at times (which is a good thing)...also reminds me of Bonnie Prince Billy (which is a very good thing). Speaking of Neil...Salvador Sanchez is essentially Cortez the Killer Redux...and it works!There's not a weak song on the album...Makes me want to buy everything Mark Kozelek ever did (and I will). He is the perfect example of how soul will outdo vocal chops every time.If you like alt-folk and this album doesn't move you...you're dead!
4,"UPS, a must have for any computer","This item works very well. I've had them in the past and do still have others on other electronic equipment in my home. Very nice to have on the computers, PS3, PS2, etc. Nothing worst than losing info / game when power is disrupted. And power surges are going on daily almost everywhere.........even the minute ones can ruin something over time."
5,Solid Backup system,I've had this APC Battery Backup system for about 6 months. It has never failed to keep my computer furnished with electrical power when the power company's electric current is interrupted. I have no idea why I put up with these electrical interruptions before this purchase. I guess I was unsure what backup system to purchase. My home is near the construction of a new road. My electricity goes out often due to the construction of the road. This APC system works 100% of the time to keep my computer humming right along. I especially love this backup when the lights go out 3 or 4 times a day. Wow! If I need another backup it will be this APC system.
2,Great--for a little while.,"At first, I thought this thing was the tops. It performed well in several power outages/fuse problems/spikes (I'm in a 1939 building & my office has mostly original wiring). After about 8 months, half of the plugs quit working altogether. I moved my important stuff to the other 3 plugs and took everything else off backup. We didn't have a power outage for a long time, so I don't know when the backup quit working on the rest, but it doesn't work anymore, although the alarm still sounds and the power light is still on. But anything plugged in will shut off with a power loss. Overall, I've owned it less than a year and a half. At this point, it's a very expensive extension cord. But the price has gone way down (it's less than half what I paid) from when I purchased mine. Either way, I'm paying more and going for a different brand for the replacement."
1,Bad UPS,"First the first battery sent to me wouldn't charge. I sent it back, seller seemed cooperative. I told them don't hurry make sure the second one takes a charge. The second one arrived so quickly there is no way they could have inspected or tested it. It didn't work. They have never made good. I still have the useless second battery. Pure junk!!"
2,"High Quality, Accessories Don't Fit","I purchased this along with the Flashlight and accessory kit (Comes with colored lenses and wrist strap) a week ago. Upon initial reciept of the items I found the quality to be quite good. The flashlight alone fit well into the holster, although it was a tight fit. Once I placed the wrist strap and lens protector on the flashlight I was unable to fit the flashlight into the holster at all.I would rate this a 4 if you weren't using accessories, but, it simply doesn't work with even the simplest accessories for the flashlight."
2,MEET THE PARENTS dvd,"the first DVD, Meet the Parents skipped on me a lot, and I couldn't watch the whole thing. the other DVD was just fine."
3,not going with kodak next time..,"I bought this camera last August for $160, which was a huge rip off because a few months later it was selling for $99, but my loss.This camera is pretty good, but I do wish it took better low lighting pictures. The styling is nice, and I like the glossy whiteness. Once in a while it seems to freeze on me, which is weird, and my friend who has the same camera, but the 10 megapixel version, has had the same experiences. Overall I rate it a 3/5, but I DON'T think my next camera is going to be a Kodak."
1,Terrible pictures,"I only got this camera because my old Kodak camera (that I loved) broke, so I got a new one that had a printer doc. Almost every picture came out fuzzy. I would have to take at least 5 to get rid of the red hands (indicating a shaky picture) and even then the quality was terrible. I finally got rid of it and got a Canon PowerShot which takes much better pics, and now when I look at my old pictures I realize how much I wasted with this Kodak, all those times and events I can never recapture on a decent camera."
5,Chopstir,This is the best thing to come around since sliced bread. Works great and does exactly what it said it will do. This is a must in everyone's kitchen!
5,My favorite new kitchen gadget!,"I saw this utensil in a friend's kitchen, but she had the fancy Pampered Chef version of it that costs over $15! It's such a simple utensil - there's no reason to pay that much for it. I ordered one and really liked it. It seems like such a simple tool, but it really does break up ground beef and sausage much faster than a wooden spoon or spatula. It is also easier to get the meat into smaller, finer pieces that way. I liked it so much, I ordered several of them and am giving them out as Christmas gifts along with jars of homemade taco seasoning."
5,PERFECT!,"This is just what I was looking for! It works great. In fact, I just ordered another one today to give to my granddaughter!"
4,Sturdy and makes quick work of chopping,"If you've stumbled upon this product, it's probably because you've wanted to find a better method for chopping ground beef and the like than using a spatula. You'll be satisfied with this. Simple and effective."
3,"Great performers, terrible recording","I have a mid-fi stereo set up with a marantz integrated amp, b & w speakers, a sony ES cd player, and $600 in cables connecting the works, and the limitations of the transition of an analog recording to a digital recreation are evident. When listening to the Russian Easter Overture, there is a lot of ""noise"" (hiss, etc.)when the orchestra is playing softly, such as in the beginning. Given that the beauty of this recording (for me at least) is the way Rimsky-Korsokov was able to gently lift the listener with ebbs and flows of stringed magic during the quiet periods, this ""noise"" is disconcerting. Otherwise, the pieces are great, just not the recording."
1,Very disappointing,I should have read the reviews before purchasing this absolutely awful production. I have downloaded videos of Kenny & the Planotones from YouTube which are far better quality than this horrid mess. I can't believe they actually charge money for this. I am a huge fan of Kenny's and I can't believe he actually permitted anything this bad to be released. Buyer Beware!!
3,Alternate holder,"I purchased this item to replace my old holder, which is going on 30 years and the leather is getting a bit frayed.This model is used as a backup or alternate holder, my primary holder being a nylon tube type, which is better for walking and moving around since it holds the flashlight rigidly, but is a pain when trying to sit.This ring type holds the flashlight more loosely and does hinder walking and running but does allow you to sit while wearing it.It does the job adequately, but then again there are not a lot of options for belt carry with long c-cell flashlights."
3,BGParker,The chipper/shredder works satisfactorily. The chipper function is very good. The shredder function is only so-so since it is difficult to feed the leaves through the loading hopper.
4,"Versatile, light duty machine","I've been using this machine for close to 2 years now to shred small branches, vegetable plant remnants, leaves and even newspaper and cardboard! (best to roll up paper and feed into branch chute) For the money, I cant really complain too much. in a nutshell...Pros: very sturdy chipper blades. very good finished mulch quality. Pretty quiet compared to gas units. very tote-able. Earth friendly.Cons: Not a heavy volume machine leaf feed opening is too small. A collection bag would have been nice. Clearing jams by unscrewing 3 thumb bolts can be a pain.Verdict: For the price, a good tool to keep small-medium yards/gardens and greenhouses tidy. If you use within it's capabilities and the blades are sharpened every year this unit should pay for itself in a few seasons if you dont have to buy mulch and you compost some of the yard waste into garden soil. Would have given the unit a 5 star rating if it included a collection bag and the leaf hopper opening was bigger."
2,McCulloch 14 amp shredder,Worked ok out of the box on small brush but the blade quickly dulls and then its basically useless. Sharpening the blades is inconvenient and time consuming. Might be fine if all you want to do is mulch leaves. I bought this as an alternative to renting a bigger unit for a day but given how difficult and slow this machine is spending the money on a rental probably makes more sense.
3,"Product seems well built, once it's assembled","First, I must give bad marks to Amazon for shipping me a resealed package which did not include the instructions and warranty materials. I'm still trying to resolve this with them. Also, I cannot find the McCulloch web page anywhere, so bad marks to them for customer service. Fortunately, another reviewer posted very good instructions and I was able to assemble it in under an hour.The product itself works well and I'm very happy with it. I don't need it for branches bigger than about an inch, since I burn those in my fireplace. For smaller branches, twigs, and debris it works great. Bear in mind that it is not for industrial use - it's much too slow. For homeowners keeping the hedges and trees under control it's just right.I give the product 5 stars, but knock it down to 3 for bad customer service."
2,Not for garden use,"If you have an abundance of 1/2 inch DRY straight tree limbs this machine is for you. Otherwise, your money would be better spent on a leaf blower/mulcher and a mulcher mower. You'll get better results in about a tenth of the time by running over garden waste with the mower and picking it up with the leaf blower."
2,McCulloch Chipper/Shredder review,"Works good, but stops up often and is a pain to undo. Have to remove 3 attachment screws each time to clean it out."
3,adequate,"This is an average machine for the price. It was extremely difficult to align the screws for assembly, and I have many years of experience with tools. Do not try to work with anything wet, as the machine will clog quickly. Dry leaves are okay, and the branch chipper is surprisingly good."
2,McCulloch Electric Chipper/Shredder,"Great concept but less than desireable execution. It is a good product and fairly easy to assemble, however, don't expect to load the hopper with more than a handful of material and then have to fascilitate the processing of what was just loaded.Two things could have changed the rating of this product; a better price and or the ability to process larger quantities of material at one time."
3,Wood Chipper,It works pretty well and has been able to chip most everything I put in there as long as it is not too big. I have had a real issue with changing the blades on it as the screws holding the blades on are so tight that I stripped out the head trying to unscrew it and now McCulloch may or may not be willing to help. Good value though.
2,Save your money,"I had high hopes for this item. I have a small yard with lots of large trees and I was hoping that this would help me reduce the pile of leaves to something manageable. First, the hopper is ridiculously small, not suitable for more than a handful of leaves at a time. Secondly, the motor is constantly bogging down, even when there isn't much in the hopper. Then you have to take it apart, clean it out, and put it back together: a feat that takes about 10 minutes and quite a bit of manual dexterity. If you've got more than a small amount to shred, you are better of purchasing a gas-powered unit. This thing will drive you crazy."
4,"Easy ro set up and use, works fine","Works as advertised. My small lot has lots of oak trees, so I get plenty of small branches to chip all year. No issues yet"
4,Electric Chipper/Shredder,"The assembly directions leave a lot to be desired, but overall, the unit seems to work well. It easily handled branches of 1/2"" in diameter. The hopper opening for leaves is small and you can not feed many in at a time. You need to use the stuffing tool that comes with the unit to fit items in the hopper. You need to be careful about the electrical outlet you use. I initially tripped a circuit breaker when I used a circuit that had other items plugged into it."
