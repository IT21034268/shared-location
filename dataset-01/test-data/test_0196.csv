3,Mid-life crisis in a jewel case.,"Time*Sex*Love...evidently MCC doesn't have enough of any of these.I bought this CD because I normally love Mary Chapin Carpenter. I think she's an exceptionally talented songwriter who is blessed with an incredible voice to back it up. I gave the CD 3 stars simply because the music, although disappointing in it's lyrical content was nonetheless breathtaking at points in it's beauty.But what I got was a collection of thirtysomething, upper middle-class angst. If I want to hear about tough choices and hectic lives, I don't need music to take me there...I live it.There's nothing wrong with music that has a melancholy mood, but this whole cd is just depressing."
1,Great Refrence but DON'T BUY IT.,"This very large book is 50% index and everything in it is referenced to the source, unlike competing products. But, it is such a giant waste of physical resources (trees) I can't encourage people buying it. Think about it, it's 50% index! This is a prime example of something that should always be computerized. Until people stop buying books like this on principle, the producers won't move the information completely to the web where it belongs."
5,It's one of the great books for thinking a doing people.,"I have had a copy for over twenty five years and it always makes my day brighter by meditateing on the thoughts great thinkers share with the world. I have redhashed the thoughts and used them in writeing, in speaking and in instructive teaching a even in church as a teacher. I would hate to be without it. I intend to get a new copy to reap the benefits of new quotations that have been added."
3,Tedious Reading,"If you are the type of reader who has plenty of patience and time, then this book is for you. It's a little difficult to maneuver through the lengthy pages, but it does contain some of the best quotes written. So, if you're ready and willing, it's for you."
2,Passable but certainly not the best ...,"This edition is a bit too trendy (and, especially, too ""politically correct"" in some respects) and omits many classic quotes featured in previous editions. I shall stay with my 15th edition and actually wish I had kept my 14th and 13th as well. Hopefully, the earlier variations are still available in nice condition at a reasonable price. I intend to do a search for some of those earlier versions and I recommend that other serious ""quote book"" users do the same."
4,"Review of Textbook - Nursing in Today's World Trends, Issues, and Management","I purchased this book as Used-Good and was uncertain of what to expect upon its delivery the cost of the book and S&H was under $12.00 which is exceptional for the purchase of any college textbook. When I received this item I was so pleasantly surprised to see that the condition of the book was perfect with the only flaws being a few creases to the front and back upper left hand corner of the book closest to the spine and a few hairline scratches showing use. This book had no underlining, notes in the margin or highlighting. I was pleasently pleased with the condition of this book for the price I paid. I would have to say I definately got a BARGAN."
3,Holiday Shows,Was good but doesn't run very long for the price u should have added maybe other frank & bing holiday shows!!!!!
3,three and a half stars,"While it is not bad, this mix just did not impress me. Although it gives you a good overview of the recent club hits, there aren't many great tracks here (although I must say that the the first tracks on both cds are incredible). It is good, accessible trance music, and yet something is missing. I just don't want to listen to it too much. Get earlier Euphoria CDs intead. For example, I liked level 4 much more. To be fair, though, I prefer deeper trance that can be heard on Global Underground. In any case,this Ibiza mix is one of those ""good, not great"" cds. By the way, Darey mixes and remixes well (it is especially evident on his Euphoria level 4 mix). The only problem is he shortens great songs, and includes long edits of tracks that need to be short, but that is a minor flaw."
2,not specific enough,"not nearly as detailed as I would have liked. More of an overview of how they work, not specifics on how to service or clean them."
2,Not Billy's best,"I have been doing Tae Bo for nine years and have a large assortment of workouts. That being said, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. For one thing, it is fairly easy compared to other Tae Bo work outs. I didn't really feel as much of a muscle burn as I had with other work outs. Some of the newer moves are fun but overall most of the moves are just repackaged Tae Bo. Also a lot of the people in the background don't seem to care about the work out like in other DVDs. My biggest complaint, which I have noticed when I bought the Tae Bo Amped DVDs as well is that the music they have picked is super annoying.I actually wish I could return this DVD. If you are a die hard Tae Bo fan you might (emphasize might) want this, but if you are looking for good Tae Bo I would not recommend this DVD."
2,Can't hear the music,"I usually enjoy Tae-Bo, but this was not up to Billy's usual standards. Would have been much more fun if you could actually hear the music - it was so muffled that sounded like it was being played from an aquarium in the next room. A few backup people look awkward and downright confused at points. Not very challenging - hardly broke a sweat after 40+ minutes."
1,Headache-inducing fragrance,"I read a lot of amazing reviews of this product before I bought it. It's made by a California company and the ingredients are almost all natural/herbal. So I thought ""great, this is the perfect product for me!"" Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the jar, I was assaulted by the extremely strong fragrance. This is a product made almost entirely of herbs of one kind or another, so it would probably be very smelly on its own (in a nice way!), but Bella B thought it would be a good idea to ADD fragrance (listed in the ingredients as ""fragrance"" -- what does THAT mean?). It's extremely strong-smelling, and the one day I tried it I had a headache all day from the fumes. Just awful. I am so disappointed that a product made almost entirely of natural ingredients would have such a strong unnatural fragrance added. I will never use this again. $20 down the drain."
5,I swear by this stuff!,"I originally bought this while shopping at Dillard's in Chicago during my first pregnancy. I started applying it in my 2nd trimester and fell in love. I went through it quickly because I applied it twice a day and used a lot at a time. Not a single stretch mark after my son was born! I am now 8 months pregnant with my 2nd and have already gone through two 4oz containers. I love this stuff! I slather it all over my belly, sides, and butt. I have 4 weeks until my due date and have not seen a single stretch mark. I gained 45 lbs with my first and 28lbs so far with my second. My mom said she got stretch marks when she was pregnant and that there's no way around it... but there is! It may be pricey for only 4oz but it's definitely worth every penny for no stretch marks. I hear other moms complain that their bellies itched while pregnant, but I can say I have never had an itchy tummy. If you want to prevent stretch marks, get this stuff!"
1,Bella honey butter,"Smells good however, leaves u with a dry chapped feeling does not leave you with a smooth silky feeling"
2,Blah,"Received the product without a seal. Butter was greasy and hard to absorb, doesnt have a pleasant smell either, will not purchase again!"
3,It's too greasy for me,"I bought this item because I read rave reviews from a bunch of celebrity Moms. I had been using Dancing Dingo's Tummy Butter. This product doesn't compare at all... it's super greasy and doesn't seem to last very long. I think part of the problem is that since it's greasy, it doesn't absorb into the skin very fast and it ends up on your clothes.I'll stick with Dancing Dingo."
3,Possibly not best if you can't handle strong fragrances,"I used this during my first pregnancy and when I first used it, I loved the aroma. But as my pregnancy progressed, the smell was entirely too strong for me to handle. Even my husband said it was strong, but he thought it was still pleasant smelling. I didn't care much for the texture of the butter, it was slightly tacky, but I never had any problems with it ruining my clothes. And I don't know if maybe I wasn't using enough (I tried to continue using it even with the strong aroma), but I still got plenty of stretch marks. It just felt as though it wasn't absorbing enough to soften my skin for stretching."
4,Alleviates itching and painful streching but is greasy,"This product alleviates itching and painful skin stretching but leaves your belly greasy. You defintely don't want to put this product on without a tank or tee to absorb the greasy ""butter."" Otherwise you run the risk of ruining a shirt or sweater. It is too early to tell if this really prevents stretch marks since I am only 5 1/2 months along. But so far so good. We currently live in a very dry winter climate. While I am constantly applying lotions and creams to the rest of my body, I only need to apply the tummy honey butter once a day. I would with the above reservation recommend this product."
2,Greasy and Runs Out Quickly,"This ""butter"" is just like a thick vaseline and sticks to my clothes. I hate the feeling of it on my hands and would have to wash it off after applying to my stomach. I'm 6 months along, and it did keep the itch away; however, I had to wait 15 minutes in the morning for enough to absorb that I could put my clothes on and not have all of it rub off. Although the price is much less than other products I've read reviews on, I used up the whole tub (applying liberally once a day) in less than a month. I used the Burt's Bees tummy butter originally, and that was cheaper and lasted a good 2 months. I loved the feel and absorption of that product but stopped using it because it contains Willowood extract. Not sure how serious of a concern that should be, but I don't take any chances when it comes to pregnancy. I guess I'll try the Mama Mio butter next."
3,A little tight,Another gift but it appears to be made nicely. I just hope that it is not too tight for my sister.
4,L'Oreal Revitalift,"Recommended to me. Hope it works. Certainly, the mild sting makes on think it should be doing something!Good price. Fast shipping."
3,Starts Great but dribbles out,"Vangelis switched over to some real rock'n loud beat stuff that was a decade ahead of Tangerine Dream's Mars Polaris CD. First five tracks are killer, I was truely blown away but then there is a bonus track that doesn't fit in followed but a not so great track and so on and soon it just crumbles. A couple of more good tracks come later... but... Very today sounding stuff really a decade ahead of the music scene back in 1988. If you love the lush floaty music of Apocalypse.. or Albedo etc you'll be put off. Much closer to late 90's Tangerine Dream."
5,Fresh perspective on Franklin,"I've read quite a bit about Franklin. There certainly are no shortage of books, but this one meets a specific need. The title is obviously a nice play on words. Among other things, it is a good introduction to the Enlightenment's influence in America."
4,The cream of 4 books on mind-body integration,"Got a hurting back or evil golf or tennis swing you can't get rid of? F.M. Alexander found a way to change bad body use and this book describes what it means and how it was discovered.No, reading the book won't cure you. You'll need Alexander lessons, but it will tell you what it's all about.The editor wrote a fine background introduction as well as made an excellent selection from Alexander's books. Just as important, he included three prefaces by John Dewey, the famous educator and philosopher, and also scientific research on the technique.The technique is more than some body process. It really teaches a Western Zen approach towards all kinds of life problems. Sound strange? Read this book. I'm very grateful I had Alexander lessons and the wisdom it teaches. Highly recommended."
1,Product defective - charged $10 for repairs,"Sister got this for Christmas. It worked fine for a few weeks. Then the buttons stopped working, and plugging a line source into the line-in socket didn't do anything. Not even the power button works.Called Memorex. They said it was a defective product. Told to find a receipt and then ship it back to them. Return shipping would cost $7.50 (even though the product was defective).Have since lost the recepit. So Memorex charges $10 for repairs.This product is a total rip-off. Do NOT get it!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time! OR MONEY!!!,I wasn't even in the market for a speaker dock but found this on sale and couldn't resist. In the beginning the iWake worked perfectly my only gripe was the remote not working efficiently. Then out of the blue the unit completely stopped working! I replaced the batteries and the a/c adapter and neither worked. My advice is to forego buying this unit at all. It was a waste of my money and I bought it on sale!
3,Kanye Sampled This,"hey yall, the ONLY reason yall probably looked up this record is because Kanye West sampled ""Maybe It's The Power Of Love"" for his song ""Never Let Me Down"" on College Dropout.He flipped this NICE!!!I mean, d*mn, maybe I need to find this record too."
5,if you live in California,"Great product if you live in California where it is illegal to mount anything on the windshield, including non semi transparent decals. This device intercepts your radio antenna cable and taps it for the antenna feed to the Garmin GPS unit. There is no noticeable effect on FM radio performance. If you have installed your own car radio then professional installation not required, but if you don't want to chance scratching up your knuckles or dashboard have it installed by a professional. As others have mentioned it is only as good as the information it receives and if you live in a area that is covered, here in LA that is not a problem."
3,Sparkle In The Finish,"Was first exposed to Ike through Internet Radio. ""Put a little love in it"" came on one day and I was blown away. The song, the voice... just everything was such a breath of fresh air. Bought the CD and still cant decide what song I like best.Wasn't all that impressed with Sparkle to be completely honest. The first single definitely has the same feel as Salesman, along with ""whatever happened to the girl in me"". The other singles don't have nearly the lyrical prowess that made Salesmen what it was. The lyrics feel awkward in places, and don't seem to have the same energy flowing through them as Ike's previous works.Would still recommend buying the CD, Just make sure to get your hands on Salesmen And Racists as well."
3,Not my favorite,"I read Cassandra King's other books before reading this one, her first. The ending disappointed me. I enjoyed the characters greatly, however. After reading the other books, I can see her growth and improvement after Making Waves, so while this wasn't my favorite, I'm glad she continued writing, because her other books were immensely enjoyable."
5,Quality,"This ring is great. Very shiny sterling silver, great design. I was looking for a more masculine ring, and this was it. Very sharp and angular, and the symmetry of this variation on the Celtic knot gives it a story as well. All I kept thinking when I was looking at the ring the past couple of days was ""only $20 for this?"" It's not going to wow anyone with its brilliance or worth, but if you're a guy like me (or just a guy in general) that's not what you're looking for. Instead, the symbolism, simplicity, and sturdiness it exudes adds a little something to whatever you're trying to represent in your outer image.Great value. If it holds up for a long time though and the black paint in between the notches doesn't fade or run, it will show its true value. No signs of it yet; had it about a week and even washed it under warm water a few times. Held up. Cheers."
4,One of the finer reads in life,"I found this book to be better than what has been previously said about it. True, if you are looking for lighthearted fare, this is not for you, but if you enjoy a fast-paced tale of forbidden love, read this one for sure!The only thing that I could not quite grasp about this novel is Violette's almost instant transition from street orphan to sophisticate. She hardly made any mistakes after her ""training""!!"
4,Naked truths about corporate world,This is a enlightening book about corporate world. It is very useful for people who are naive about rough workplace politics. I myself is a victim of politics and could fix myself few weeks after reading this valuable book. I think the title is misnomer. It is useful for men as well as women. The book is written in informal style and pleasurable to read. I know I will read and re-read this book until I hit the top of the ladder.
5,what a ride,"Wow! I really enjoyed this film,It has some great scenes and excellent acting.It has some gore,violence,sex and a cool,sorta simple story.This is stuart gordons best film next to re-animator in my book.dont miss"
2,Splashy and Unimaginitive,"This film is the cinematic equivalent of the child who stands at the side of the pool and shouts ""Mom, look at me! Watch this! Mom! Mom!"" and then executes a non-descript cannonball.The production team spent a lot of time thinking up sound effects for violence. Heads are chopped off, whacked with golf clubs, and generally treated poorly. Meanwhile we are watching a so-so story with so-so performances (other than the Baldwin brother, who is nice and creepy). There is absolutely nothing done cinematically to produce tension - all the shots are standard medium shots, the lighting is uniform throughout, and the camera seems to have been frozen in place during the entire film. Booooring.How many times must we see, as a final shot, the protagonist walking away in slow motion while all behind him is devoured by flame? One more time, at least. All in all, a film meant to impress the kids. -Mykal Banta"
2,no difference,"Used this for a month and didn't really notice any difference. I wasn't expecting miracles, but thought i'd see something subtle."
2,Not so good for the price!,"My husband got it for me as Christmas gift.I insisted that he gave it to me before Christmas Eve 2007.Yesterday morning, I used it to cut papaya, no luck.Reason: the papaya is not round! eventhough I sliced the papaya down to 10 cm and quarter of the normal papaya thickness, its size is large for this machine.I tried to julliene carrot, only the fat half cut ok, the skinning haft didn't cut to strand. It came out as little rings.sigh....."
2,Makes me long for simplicity,"This slicer is far too difficult for the job it is trying to do. I have tried to make it work a half dozen times and it just is too challenging. It doesn't hold the veggies tight enough, or they wobble or they fall off. Definitely not a tool to use if you want to work quickly. I recently bought a new handheld spiral cutter. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RMEK4/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i03 It is much better. I will be taking the Beriner Turner Slicer to goodwill now."
4,Works well,So far the product is working well and is very sturdy-I have had it for a month and use it a few times a week. I am very happy with the purchase.
5,Original,"This album is fantastic by Taylor Dayne, ""Tell It To My Heart"" hit seven and sold one million and features the number two hit ""Dont Rush Me"" which I love. This album sold 3 million which showed someone liked her. If want dance get this."
2,Hawaii Calls CD,"Was under the impression from the review that it was an instrumental, but as it turns out, it was all vocal and not easy to listen too. I tried to exchange it with the supplier, but they did not have any options."
1,Very little on Gondwanaland,"I bought this book after its subject matter - a journey round the super continent of Gondwanaland - caught my imagination. It was, however, very disappointing.Firstly the author fails to fulfil his own brief: there is very little on Gondwanaland and what material there is seems added as an after thought rather than being the driving purpose of the journey. Second, it is full of implausibilites and unlikely situations; the characters Shah meets on the way are so incredible as to be untrue. Third, it is terribly paced with over a third of the book dedicated to Bombay, whilst the journey from Caracas to Buenos Aires only takes up 60 pages.I could continue, point after point, with criticisms of the book - but by now you've probably worked out I wasn't very impressed with it. Originally, I was going to give the book a two-star rating but the ending changed my mind. It is so absurd, so implausible that it left me feeling angry and cheated.Not a happy reader!"
4,Great basket!,"I ordered this for a friend who was having a baby girl.I was very happy with the quality of the basket, but thought the material used for the lining and blanket was a little cheap. The material for the blanket was really stiff and hard. It was almost like a changing pad."
4,Can't wait for #12,I think it was this was a good story because Salem talks and is funny. I like the part where he throws the cat tantrum! I can't wait for the next story!
2,Nothing at all Special,"This flick is just a ""Queer as Folk"" rip off except is has a dull story and very light sex. Kind of a ""PG"" version of ""QAF"". Get drunk, get stoned, go to a night club. The trailer was more entertaining and much cheaper."
4,"a few bobbles, but overall very enjoyable","I agree with chiisuchi that the Dark Horse episode was a bit of a puzzler, but I found it fun nevertheless. I was far more confused by ""Flowers and the Detective Part 2."" I also had some issues with some of the translation, but I've come to expect that with anything Tokyopop does. Nevertheless, I had been waiting for this volume for months, and I enjoyed every second of reading it. D and Leon continue to have a wonderfully suggestive relationship, and the whole thing is tons of heebiejeebie-inducing fun. I think this manga (and the too-brief anime series) is really underappreciated. Tokyopop says there shouldn't be such a long wait for volume 5 -- thank goodness!!"
2,Lacks depth,"The book is very shallow - the section on sex is one page, for example. There is no discussion of AIDS, STD's or using birth control. If you are looking for a book to begin a conversation with your teenage son, go ahead and buy it. If you are looking for a book that will discuss the many issues of teenage life (emotions, friends, sexuality, drugs) in depth - this is not the book."
2,Disappointed,Two of the 3 fell to the counter within 1 week. Are still working and will use glue to restick. Not as much light as I expected. BP
3,Not Quite Enough Light,"Other reviewer was quite right; not good for under the kitchen counter or over the kitchen sink, but could be handy in other places - closet for example!!!!"
1,I bought three of these and none of them worked!,"Beware! Where is the quality control here? I purchased three of these and all three of them were DOA. And since they're opened, I'm not sure if I can send them back (at least that's how I read the policy). And try getting Amazon on the phone -- what a joke.Highly NOT recommended."
1,Sylvania DOT - Bright white LED Light,Useless. Not even enough light to help under kitchen cabinets or over stove. A complete waste of money. The review option didn't allow me to give the Sylvania DOT LED light a NO star rating.
4,Stuck to the forehead,"I love these little lights as they are very bright. The only downfall is that the adhesive in the back isn't as strong as I would like. In fact, I once used this little light as a flashlight to find something. And when I needed both hands I had no choice but to slap it on my forehead and go rooting around. I found it, and realized that weirdly enough, the Sylvania Dot-it adheres better to my forehead than the wall!"
4,Good light where you need it,This is a bright light that I have stuck on the inside roof of the car because I didn't have a map light. It works well. I just sometimes have to touch it a couple of times to get it turned on or off. I sent one to my sister and she likes it too.
4,So so,"Good product, solidly built. But after I stuck in on the top of the inside of my drawer, changing batteries was a headache."
4,great lights,powerful when its dark...maybe at nights..but not so powerful in closets..the reason i got it...my husband keeps one by on his bedside if he cant reach the lamp..its got many uses actually.
4,Great little light,I've used this for several months now and it works very well. It's bright and convenient and the battery lasts a long time.
2,if only the light didn't fade so fast...,"I ordered 3 of these lights for my desk space at work, which is normally very dark. When I put these lights in place, the light was a bright, attractive blue that lit up my work space.Of the 3 I ordered, only one is putting out light that is even comparable to the first day. I've been using the lights for just under two weeks now, and they are on for about 8 hours at a time. Now two lights are shining a very dull yellow.Change the batteries you say? Good Luck! The only way to change the batteries is to un-stick the lights and remove the back with a Philips screwdriver - and let me say that if there is one thing these lights do very well, it is stay put!!Not at all what I'd hoped for."
5,very bright!,"I stuck one in each of my bedroom closets and they really work well, better than those ""tap lights"" that were so popular a while back. With winter coming and those dark mornings ahead I will need the help to see my clothes in there. The price is right too. I bought a few in different colors and am trying to think of ways to use the rest of them. They are super bright!"
3,"Easy to install & use, but could be brighter.","I purchased these lights to put under my kitchen cabinets to illuminate where my overhead lights could not reach. (Mainly to help to light recipes, cookbooks, etc.) They were extremely easy to install (peel and stick!) and are very easy to use, but I was a little disappointed with their brightness. I had to put 4 in a row under my main workspace cabinets to supply any usable amount of light, and I still wish they were a bit brighter. However, they are a good temporary solution until we can afford hardwired lights! These are good for places that need a little bit of light, but not bright enough to be relied on for a main source for reading or detailed work."
3,not so re-stickable,"This light was not as bright as I'd hoped (for a closet). In addition, though it seems sticky enough, and my surface was clean, high-gloss paint, the light drops off pretty much daily from a vertical surface. A great idea, very attractive package, but not as useful as I'd hoped."
5,LOVE THEM!!,"I love these things! Where do I use them? I have one on the side of my nightstand, out of sight, but much easier to reach in the middle of the night than the table lamp, which is quite a reach. I like the fact that they can go on a vertical surface, and therefore don't take up any room on a useable surface. Also the light is not glaring, so it doesn't wake anyone else up, but gives a nice glow. Ordering more today."
2,It's o.k.,I expected to have a small light suitable for task lighting in an undercounter area. It's more of a bright night light. I was disappointed. AND the batteries get sucked up quickly.N--
2,Not my best purchase,These lites are nit that great. I bought them to go under my cabinets and they have poor lighting!!!!
3,I absolutley adore Strawberry Shortcake!,"I managed to track down this book through an old book shop, and boy does it take you back. I got to experience all over again the joy of little strawberry shortcake and her friends. This book however is elementary level and so not for the ""grown-ups"" unless you are a die hard fan. I hope you like this book as much as me!"
3,"ok ,but others are more better","i like the blues/guitar type of music and have listened to many of them.From Stevie ray vaughn, to Doyle bramhall, to some upcoming starts like Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.Also check out Contagious Blues Band...........these are worth it to liste to."
4,Good,"When i bought this i thought it was bigger then actually is, but its a good product. In my opinion, for the eyes its not that good, I have been using mary kay for the eyes and i think its better then this one."
3,"Aftermath of teh Holocaust, Not the Actual experience","This book had the potential to be much more far reaching than it was. It felt as if the author was holding back more than she was telling her experiences. For that reason, the book is stilted and irregular in its thoughts. If you are looking for a detailed recounting of what occurred in the camps, this memoir is not for you. It is much more about the aftermath of the holocaust than it is the actual event. That is not to say that it isn't worth reading it just isn't necessarily a typical memoir of the Holocaust in that shies away from detail and narrative."
4,Great book for travel,Great book for travelling. Small in size so fits in a backpack or purse easily without much weight.
3,Good Silly TIme Travel Romance,"I like it. It kept me entertained. I put it down for a bit but I finished it. Dont look to this to be a mind blowing addicting read, but if you want easy read that is predictable but comfortable, read it."
3,Berserker hero gets nailed by Cupid!,"I'm pretty surprised to find ""To Tame A Highland Warrior"" a pleasant read. It's a much better and polished book compared to the author's debut. So what if the characters in this book have linguistic terminologies a few centuries ahead of their contemporaries? I manage to overlook that and hence, enjoyed this good story with the amusingly obtuse yet charming Grimm and the headstrong heroine.Sure, there could be room for improvements - the language, a better fleshing out of the relationship between Grimm and his girlfriend (instead of emphasizing on the external intrigue plot), but all in all, it's a very nice way to spend a lazy afternoon. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this author's next book."
4,To Tame a Highland Warrior,This was a quick read. I enjoyed it very much. It is not necessary to have read the previous books in the series to understand what is going on.
3,Not my favorite.,"I initially liked this product when I started using it. After a few days, I realized that it takes a long time for my skin to dry after applying this cream. I changed my makeup routine to allow for extra drying time so that my face powder would not be applied to damp skin. Yes, it does do a nice job of moisturizing but I wouldn't buy it again because it seems a little too wet for me. I normally do not have issues with acne but since using this for the past 2 weeks I have developed 2 pimples. This is most likely due to the moisturizer because I am 36 yrs old and have not had problems with acne since my early 20's."
3,Loreal Paris hydra-renewal continuous moisture cream,"Bought this product because I couldn't find it anywhere! I Had used the product before, and had been pleased with it! PROS: It has a pleasant scent, it has a creamy texture, and I did notice a positive change in my skins appearance after only a few uses. CONS:There was subtle tingling on face once applied. Not sure if it was because I had sensitive skin."
4,Love this product,"This is great if you have normal to dry skin as I do. I think for the price its great, and doesn't make me break out and only have to put it on once and I am hydrated the rest of the day!"
4,Great Clapton/Beck Comp,"This one has all of the pre-Page Clapton/Beck stuff you'd want. However, if you're not a fan of mono recordings you might want to skip this one. Most of the tracks are in that form. The booklet gives a nice, concise history of the band. No other pics than the one that's on the cover, though."
5,Suspense at its best!,Wow!Talk about not wanting to respond to mother nature's calling after watching the first couple of scenes!Wonderful!
1,This movie is really bad,"This movie was so bad, I had to write a review. Anyone who thinks this movie was good is foolish. The bad guys were too dumb to take serious. Comon, the kidnappers even never tied up the victems! So the whole movie you see the victems get the better of the kidnappers. I did not like anyone in this movie, it was just too horrible of a story. If I could rate it -5 stars I would."
2,Nothing special...,"Charlize Theron gets the 2 stars :)It begins interestingly and full of promise, but it drags and ends in a silly climax that hardly leaves you satisfied. The acting throughout is not going to win oscars and the plot and cinematographic direction is less than original. Overall, not a BAD film, but just another thriller lacking much substance.Yawn."
4,Disturbing but good,"This is all in all a good movie but as the mother of a little girl I found this movie to be very disturbing and heartwrenching. I cried ALOT!! I loved Charlize Theron's character in the movi however, it could have survived without Courtney Love!"
2,Predictable Kidnapping Drama...,"The perfect kidnapping scheme is put into action by Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon) for the fifth time as he and his companions kidnap Abby from the Jennings family. The plan consists of kidnapping Abby from the Jennings as Joe's brother, Marvin (Pruitt Taylor Vince), watches Abby for 24 hours. During this time Joe dictates to the mother what she should be doing to get the safe return of her daughter. While all of this is going on,, the father is self-contained as he is on a business trip. However, this time something goes wrong as Abby suffers from asthma. The cast performs well in this suspenseful action film, but it does not save the film as there is not much suspense in this predictable kidnapping drama. Trapped fails to convey a message as it jumps from scene to scene which ends up hurting the overall cinematic experience."
1,Waste of money,I dont like this flimsy thing. The side zipper makes no sense because because you wrinkle your clothes trying to get them in and out. Will be returning for something different.
3,not too bad,The bag is great for just weekend travel. I would not recommend it for a checked bag on an airline.
2,Disappointing,"I realize that this was not an expensive bag, but I thought it would at least have handles so as to make it easier to carry. If I had only looked a bit closer and realized that there were none. I cannot recommend this bag to anyone except possibly to someone who will only use it to/from car, i.e. not while running through airports, and needs to save money. Poor product."
2,Not as advertised,"The product description lists ""multiple pockets for organization,"" but there is just a front ID holder on the bag. Would have never bought product otherwise and I will be returning it. I can pick up a plain garment bag without pockets for half the price locally."
2,Work well but the zipper is oddly placed,This does function just as it should but the zipper does not make it easy to open and put the clothing in.
5,"Nice Price, Fast Shipping, Seems pretty durable.....",I bought this for my husbands Marine Uniform so I wanted something really thick. It's roomy and his Uniform fits nice with extra space even. I did want thicker material but this is nice My Husband likes it. The material is a little thicker than a windbreaker jacket material. Hope this review helps.
1,Not very user friendly,Bag has its only opening via a zipper on the side of the bag. The zipper does not reach far enough up on the bag (somewhere below where the shoulder of a suit jacket would be). Loading and unloading clothing is very difficult and awkward. Would not recommend this bag.
3,"Good fabric, zipper broke, you get what you pay for","This bag lasted me just under a year.The fabric is good and tough, yet lightweight. My clothes were well protected.The bag has two Velcro clasps that allow you to fold the bag in half for travel while keeping the clothes protected. I found the Velcro to be somewhat useless as it comes with a strap that you loop over the hangars to fold the bag in half.The provided loop is way too big so I tied a knot in it to reduce it's size and make the garment bag actually fold in half.My major issue is that after 11 months of weekly use the zipper failed, with the zipper car splitting in half and falling off the bag.I will probably replace the bag with the identical item as ~$9 is reasonable for a bag that lasts one year."
2,Pricey and parts break easily,"I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. I bought them new for $89 each and put them together with help from a friend. They were tricky to assemble on the base, and flimsy. I had issues immediately with the way the lids on each side attach to the plastic roof member which supports them, they are difficult to seat in the groove and then if raising them too high to get into them, they release the whole lid making it fall off. Also, the arms the lock the plastic lids down to the base are very brittle and snap off easily. I can't get replacement parts either as its made in Isreal. If I were to do this again, I'd go with a nicer, dual walled polycarbonate unit that has aluminum fittings and not plastic in critical places like latches and pins. Don't waste your money!"
1,Psychologcal Warfare,"I have read and enjoyed all of Fullerton's Everad series. On that basis, I ordered ""Not Thinking of Death"" expecting the same blend of history, action and character development. I have not finished the book - every few pages there is a break from the sparse action, with a flashback to former times and relationships - in much detail, none of it interesting. I will now read the reviews before ordering another Fullerton book!"
3,a good eurhoric entry,"This, the third in the Euphoria collection, is a good album. But unfortunately fails to lift the listener to the same state of euphoria as the fist two entries. Playing this album load, pumping out those beat heavy european dance tunes is a great experience and I do reccomend this entry to anybody who has already got the first two euphoria's. Maybe instead of ""a higher state of...."" they should have called it ""a slightly lesser state of....""."
5,with heart,"The title draws you in for an easy ""fix"" but this book is full of healthy and easy to use advice;well written and researched with an eye catching lay out. A real winner for all women who either hope to prevent or need to heal their hearts."
1,Dont bother,"Nothing to see here, move along. Seriously. 4 vamps who have boyfriends that are weird. A ""Van Helsing"" with a putz of a son. 3 more vamps who are looking to take out the other 4 & the Van Helsings. Shoes, custom coffins, plywood painted sets & everything is cheap. Nothing worthwhile. Don't bother wasting your time or money."
1,Ode to the One Hit Wonder!,"I bought this album for ""Stacy's Mom""and little did I know why the sudden success of the band.It was because of the awkward, individual-america loving song. The kind that 1 hit one wonders are labeled.And ode, the album is filled with clever songs, but it is nothing compared to ""stacy's mom"" the first 3 songs are ok, but after that it all goes downhill.So do not watse your money, just buy the single.simple as that,so long FOW..."
5,Incredible Pop CD,"This is simply one of the best CDs to come out this year. Catchy music combined smart, clever, and at times funny lyrics. The music critics from Blender ( Five stars out of five ), Entertainment Weekly (A-), and others have praised this CD and they're right.Buy this CD, you'll love it."
5,Go Away 1-Star Reviewers,"What a pleasure this release is. From the opening notes of Mexican Wine, through the pop energy of Bright Future in Sales and Stacy's Mom, the Beatlesque melody of Hackensack, to the closing notes of Your and Mine.Highly recommended. 5-stars!"
2,Disappointed,"Fountains of Wayne was one of my favorite bands throughout my early adolescence. Their first two albums soundtracked a lot of my favorite memories between the ages of 12 and 15. I hadn't heard anything about them in a while, and they disappeared to the back of my mind. When I heard they had a song on the radio again, I got excited, hoping that their album would be as good as their others. Unfortunately, it is not, although songs like ""Stacy's Mom"" are ridiculously catchy. The one high point of this album is ""Hackensack,"" which its nice to see they finally released as a studio album, but I found even that to be a letdown, as I definitely enjoyed the live version better. Still, its nice to see that FOW is still around. It just surprises me to see that this album is becoming their most successful."
2,DBH by the BHG,"When I first got this EP it didn't impress me much. Most of the songs were also released on the Bloodhound Gang's debut full length ""Use Your Fingers."" One bright spot is the original version of ""Coo Coo Ca Choo"" but other than that this is really nothing more than a fun collectible for the die hard fan."
4,"Great rainy day, in front of the fire book.","Sure it was somewhat predictable but calm and quiet. I had a litle trouble getting into the book but once there I really enjoyed the interplay between the couple and loved the use of letters, hers to her mentor, his grandmother; and later theirs to one another. I'm off to select another Judith Michael book!"
2,It is going down hill,"Not that I was ever a huge Limp Bizkit cd before this cd I actually thought they were good. I mean the things you got to do to sell an album. It is a good thing that Wes decided to ditch the band it was getting him no where. I really liked Chocolate Starfish. And I really thought they had talent. But when they make a (bad) cd like this it just makes me wonder. Was Limp Bizkit a good band? Yes, were they a good band after they made that cd? No, the least they could've done is wait till the other guitarist came in the band before making a the next cd so it would'nt be old songs."
4,Pretty Good,"Hi I'm 11. I've been a big Limp Bizkit fan for a while, and i bought this cd yesterday(the first day it came out) and wasn't disapointed. It's a pretty good cd, but not Limp Bizkit's best. That might be because it's all remixes but i don't know.The best tracks are probably both versions of ""Nookie"",""N2GetherNow"",and ""Counterfeit"",but they are all pretty good. I recommend this cd to any good Limp Bizkit fan."
1,Help Im lost in a Backstreet Boyz vs Snoop Dog CD..........,"RU kidding me leave the old songs alone.It was unlistenable. Maybe Fred Timberlake was thinking about getting back to his tru hip hop roots, but he left his rock edge completely out of this CD. If youre a fan of hip hop then this might...I caution...might be for you. If youre a fan of what music is in the Limp Bizkit library then dont disappoint yourself and get it"
1,a new low for limp bizkit,"no one should buy this cd. limp bizkit sold out very bad but i never thought it could get this out of hand. what they have done is taken thier most pop, overplayed, teenybopper songs and had them remixed by rap producers. what were they thinking? i feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is quality music. DO NOT EVER BUY THIS!!!(...)"
3,The three stars are for the Timbaland Remixes,"Of course, as everyone who knows anything about music would know, the two Timbaland remixes are the best songs on the album and he makes these sounds many times better than the originals. Other than that, the rest of the album is filler material."
1,Where did it go wrong?,"""Limp Bizkit is one of the hottest bands out there."" Ah, remember those days? When most of the music fan population supported that phrase and we were basically blind to the world. I too had that day and a half of blindness, but this album really smacked sense into me. Not in the way it was aiming, but in the fact that Limp Bizkit has pretty talented group of musicians (Wes is good, theres no denying) fronted by a very big dumbass. This album is not good, at all. The remixes, of songs that should have been left alone in the first place, are pure garbage. They're repetitive, weak, and very annoying. The only thing Fred Durst proved here is that he has the ability to take talented mixers and rappers and turn their efforts into crap. At least put some variety into it, my god how many ""My Way"" remixes do we need. The title of this album should have been, ""Watch us make crappy songs worse than they were before"" because thats all that you pay 15$ here for."
1,It's actually... funny.,"I'm glad i don't own this one, but i only listened the samples without caring any of your comments. The samples were actually mad funny, stupid robot sound effects on the background while this whiny kid is trying to rap with his whiny kind of way over lame beats. Butch Vig's Remix of the Nookie sounded most hilarious. No question, this was a lazy attempt of stealing pocket money from silly kids who loved limp bizkit back then. Do we even need to mention how ""results may vary"" was the final nail in the coffin? Okay, nowadays they've been trying to make another comeback with some poor effort of an EP and all that greatest hits stuff. That's not gonna success... Once fred durst made himself a clown, will he always be remembered as a clown. No need to try comebacks, because no one takes them seriously anymore. That's the way when you're living in the popular music industry."
4,It's all a matter of taste...,"If you like the trend of Limp Bizkit moving towards hip-hop, then you have to get this. Get some hot producers, mix in some hits, and serve. If you're more into the ""$3 Bill"" era of Limp, then this isn't going to be essential to add to your collection. That being said, Timbaland's remix of ""Re-arranged"" is really a great track...it has a great feel and Bubba Sparxxx adds a nice flow."
3,"Good, but anyone for OVERKILL????","I love Fred and the gang, but how many ways can you listen to the song ""My Way""?? Also the Puff Daddy/P.Diddy remix almost kept me from buying it.... I dig the ""rearranged"" track,..."
1,"Seriously, you call this Metal?","Ok, right, in all seriousness, i used to like LB, the first album was pretty neat, sure the songwriting was poor, but wes made the band come alive, from there on they gradually lost something with each album, and choc starfish was a poor rap/metal album, with blatant chiched lyrics, and some awful ""songs"" but its a masterpiece compared to this. LB had nowt to do with it, the producers took their random selection of track and just changed the music! freds lyricks sound even more shakey than usual without the chug of wes's guitar to back them up, the beats are [bad], i mean, i want to wriet a really fair review but ist liek this, if you liek rap, then this album [is bad], if you liek metal, there isnt ANY here, its by far the worst LB album ever, it totally sticks of a band who are desperate to rake in all they can, and i guarantee if anyone can say theres one good thing about it they are lying, i hoep LB can find their old sound one day but this is a joke"
1,this album [is terrible]!,"on the album ""chocolate starfish"", i loved how they had a mix of hip-hop & rock, but on this album they took songs from there other albims & combind them. it's so [bad] plus all they do on all there albums is cuss, cuss, cuss! i think limp biskit should not be aloud to play music."
3,works ok,"Works ok, not as bright as I expected but fine. Easy to mount. The quality so far is ok (have had this for a month or so). Does not look very cheap nor does it have a high quality feel."
1,"tl-ld1000, dangerous in any mode","Friends don't let friends ride with this taillight--it cuts out. it'll come back on if you whack it, but you don't know when a taillight goes out. changing the batteries makes it work, but the problem is not the batteries. the jostling it gets when you change batteries is what makes it work.Cat eye customer service is great--they'll send you a brand new one if you send it back, but do you really want another 1000? Well, maybe, IF they have fixed the problem, but since they haven't acknowledged the problem...I'm told some of the newer ones have some internal bits made a little different and may hold the batteries tighter, so maybe they're okay...maybe.don't use this light as your only taillight--use with a back-up. the cat-eye 600 is a fine light."
5,Excelente luz de seguridad,"Excelente luminosidad, algo focalizada, pero que se supera con los 10 led que la integran, los cuales tienen un brillo impresionante muy visible a larga distancia, cumpliendo con su funcion de brindarnos seguridad. Algo delicado se ve el soporte, cuestion de tener cuidado al momento de quitar o fijarlo a la bicicleta.En definitiva un excelente producto para recomendar."
1,"Problem with Adorama, NOT actual product","Without going into excruciating detail, Adorama shipped an empty filter case to me that did not contain the Heliopan UV filter I ordered.To resolve this issue with Adorama was aggravating and took around a month's time.Once my money was finally refunded, I ordered the same product directly from B&H; Photo and received it within two days.I will never order anything from Adorama again."
4,Next of Kin,"This is a good read, a little reminisent of some of the Catherine Cookson books. The story evolves around the death of the American wife of Robin and how her life impacted on his family and the neighbors in this English village. The arrival of a young friend of his step daughter adds a nice touch. The arrival of Zoe brings about a great many changes in the family and a growth of charachter in Robin. However, this is not a new book. It was first published in 1996 and readers should probably check their shelves before rushing out to purchase this book I wish I had. Because now I have the hardover novel I purchased in '96 and a trade copy."
3,Not up to her usual standards.,"Although I enjoyed the book as a whole, I didn't think it had the depth that you usually find with her work. However, the characters were realistic and believable, and the author did a wonderful job of making us realize the emotional pain that can be inflicted on people due to miscommunication and assumptions."
4,Gives a little insight to the amazing singer,"First off, why are so many Sarah McLachlan fans disappointed with this cd? It was released in 1988 (yes, 1988 and NOT 1989) and the whole music genre was different. Sarah's singing is much higher than on her later, more personal releases, but ""Touch"" is nonetheless entertaining and fun to listen to such a young woman try to find her voice. Not up to par with ""Solace"", FTE or ""Surfacing"", this album is still worth your money."
3,It could just float away. . .,"Sarah McLachlan's airy entry into diary-style poetry and marginal New Age music could make you swear you were in a women's bookstore in Mendocino, with windchimes tinkling outside. With such a powerful voice, and at such a young age, it is diappointing that her expression would have been so vague. The hollow music seems to dilute all of the emotional impact of this dainty, self-conscious studio effort......Which makes it all the better as a home for ""Ben's Song,"" perhaps the most shattering song McLachlan has ever recorded. In this case, the airiness works on a transcendent level, with Sarah's dovelike voice soaring gently into your soul, quietly ripping your heart out in an effectively undramatic portrait of child mortality. Otherwise, it's a disposal album, and will remain so until McLachlan matches the potential she demonstrated in a single track."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I can't believe that I spent money on this book. Besides the editorial mistakes, there is so much information in this book that is not correct. I know there are a lot of philosophies concerning solid vocal technique. I am a professional singer and teacher of voice and have worked with a number of teachers, coaches, and conductors. I have studied the different approaches for breath control, vowel modification, etc. This author is rather narrow in her views and she contradicts several of her own statements. If you want to learn to sing, find a good voice teacher and avoid this book."
2,Pity The Poor Soul,"Pity the poor soul who wrote these words:>The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear it is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off.<This same review was copied and pasted across all the Partridge Family albums on Amazon. I don't know why this poor soul has such a hatred for this band but he/she does. Very sad.I encourage you to ignore the ravings of this madman. Rather consider the fact that SO MANY of the reviews of the Partridge Family albums on Amazon are overwhelmingly positive! I think that speaks for itself!/fwa"
1,Yikes almighty!,"As a lark I entered Partridge Family in an Amazon music search and I was horrified at how many titles are still in print.What is even more unsettling is to see what other titles people who bought this CD also got. Come on people, can you really distinguish one Partridge Family song from another? This has got to be some of the lamest stuff ever recorded. So lame it makes Barry Manilow sound cutting edge."
5,SUPERB PRESENTATION!,Robocop is an inventive Paul Verhoeven directed film that is presented in the best HD format BLU-RAY. Both the picture and sound are excellent. If one does not have a BLU-RAY player now is the time to enter the arena.
2,IT'S TOO BLODY!,"Iv'seen this movie and my dad FFed turough half of it. He said that it was too gory, and I agree. I olny gave it 2 stars beacuse I like cyborgs"
3,STOP! Or there will be.... trouble.,"This movie still holds up. It is great fun and extremely violent. The villians are just about as slimey, hateful and evil as they come. Ronnie Cox is great in a turn from his usual nice guy roles of the past. All the special effects and Weller in that big old clunky costume are just great. I enjoyed this movie in the theater many years ago and it still holds up. Lots of tongue in cheek stuff mixed with some ultra violent insanity."
3,"Good, but not Great","I enjoyed the movie, but I am glad I bought it on sale. For under $16 is was a good deal. For anything above $20 I would not get this movie. The video transfer was just so-so. I have seen films older than ""Robocop"" look much better. Still, I didn't have this movie on standard DVD, and it does look a little better on Blu. Buy it on sale."
4,Not Collectible Steelbook,Beware this is not the collectible steelbook edition. I had to return it. However Amazon's customer service is very courteous.
2,Alright,Robocop is okay. But I don't really like it much. The setting is in Detroit. It's about a cop who is killed and then is turned into a robocop. He's then sent out to stop the bad guys while also getting revenge on those who killed him. I didn't like it but see it if you want. You might like it.
3,"Good movie, not right packaging.","I actually returned this one because it wasn't the on in the collector's tin, but the movie is still the same so I still gave it 3 stars."
3,UNRATED????,IS THIS AT LAST THE UNRATED VERSION OF THIS MOVIE????? MGM IS WRONG WITH US BECAUSE THE LAST DVD IS CUT SO????
4,"Clarence Boddicker, Old Man, and OCP. What more can you get?","No more!!! RoboCop is perhaps the most violent movie I have ever seen yet not half as bad as most violence.If you have seen my past reviews, I am highly fond of RoboCop 3 yet if had to, RoboCop is the best way to go.It is dramatic and action-packed and unlike James Bond, this guy can do the stunts that Bond does and it does not make a farfetched film.In it, Alex J. Murphy is murdered in a steel mill in front of the eyes of his partner, Ann Louis.IT IS A BLOODY SCENE!He is immediately dragged to a lab where he is half dead and is brought back to life as a crime- smashing cyborg.He sets out to help the innocent and has flashbacks of his family yet is suppost to be memory wiped and at the same time, Murphy goes after his killer and evil gang, Clarence Boddicker, but find it may not be the easiest thing, even with in-destructable medal!!!The action is heart-stopping yet almost soothing and addicting!And remeber kids, ""STAY OUT OF TROUBLE!"""
3,Satirical Fun and Bloody Carnage...[poor] Criterion DVD,"The unrated director's cut really isn't that spectacular. I'd rather not see Murphy's hand disappear in a cloud of blood, or see some exec shot to hell 1000 times more than he should've been, or see a guy doused in toxic waste disintegrate on a car. Those things just aren't that special.The commentary saves the disc though. It's a great track, one of Verhoeven's best. The storyboards are mediocre, the film-to-storyboard comparison is ok, and the illustrated making-of isn't much fun.All in all, a classic movie that everyone should own. Expecially for it's satirical take on the Reagan era. But buy the regular version, don't waste your money on this DVD."
4,Full of Extras!,"I've been a fan of this film since I first saw it at a small downtown theater in South Dakota. I'm not a fan of gory or ultra violent films; but this picture, along with its tongue and cheek humor, was like watching a live action adult comic book. With this two disc, 20th Anniversary edition, you not only get a choice to watch the Theater or the Extended Cut of the film, you get plenty of what I always look for when I purchase a DVD; EXTRAS, FEATURETTES & COMENTARY. My favorite was the documentary- ""Flesh and Steel"": The Making Of Robo Cop. Finally, I like the packaging with its metal box. One thing I didn't much care for was the difficulty of getting the individual discs out of its casing. Plus, they are stacked so you have to take one disc out to get to the other disc. With the hard to release casing; get ready for a project!"
5,Justice is served on DVD!,"A Ultra-violent Science-Fiction Action thriller from Paul Verhoeven ( Total Recall, Basic Instict) about a lone Cop named Murphy ( Peter Weller) who gets dismembered by a gang, comes back as a Cyborg named "" Robocop"" who has a taste for revenge and justice. The Director's Cut is fabulous and amazing, it's even perfect and flawless in my opinion with the storyboards, uncut scenes and everything that a Robofan would love. It's got Gore, Violence and Humor galore, a must see! recommendations for this movie: Blade Runner, The Matrix, Total Recall, Evil Dead, Starship Troopers, Heavy Metal, The Fifth Element, Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Akira, Scanners and Ghost in the Shell."
4,"Great movie, get the criterion version","This movie I absolutely loved. If you are going to purchase it, buy the Criterion version, instead. It has less than one minute of additional footage which was to violent for the theatrical release, but it has great commentary by the director and others."
1,Bad Transfer,"Washed out colors and an overall softness of the image had me scratching my head. Did previous editions look like this? And sure enough, the ""Robocop Trilogy"" boxset from a couple of years ago looks significantly better, even if there is a little edge enhancement visible in some scenes. Buyer beware."
4,ONE OF THE BEST COP MOVIES EVER,"A COP [PETER WELLER] IS VIOLENTLY MURDERED BY A GANG OF CRIMINALS. SOON, A COMPANY NAMED OCP USES HIS FACE FOR A ROBOT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PERFECT COP. BUT, PROBLEMS COME WHEN HE SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST THOSE WHO KILLED HIM AS A HUMAN. THIS EXTREMELY VIOLENT ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST COP MOVIES EVER MADE. THE ACTING IS GOOD, THE ACTION IS GREAT, AND THE PLOT TWISTS ARE CLEVER. ANY ACTION FAN SHOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS, AN ANIMATED TV SERIES, A LIVE-ACTION TV SERIES, AND FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES."
2,what a difference from Atol Scrap,"Buying Atol Scrap was one of those impulse purchases that introduced me to this wonderful music that I could listen to over and over again and appreciate it more each time.So when Arovane came out with another album, buying it was a no brainer, or so I thought. This music is so different from and inferior to Atol Scrap that I'm having a hard time listening to the album for the first time, without wanting to change the cd. It is all so blah, like elevator music.So, chances are if you liked Atol Scrap, and you want more of the same, this is not it, don't waste your money."
1,Why would anyone give this movie a good rating???!!!!!!!,"You are never told who, or what, is terrifying the people. There is just an abrupt ending without any explanation. Was the monster an alien, a ghost, a creater from the underworld ??? And what ever happened to the previous families who arrived at the mysterious town ???I'm not only criticing the ending, the entire movie really was not very scary. If you see this movie at your local video rental store, stay away from it. Really a ""Zero"" star movie, but zeros are not selectable in amazon.com reviews."
2,Lack of content does not equal a story,"Questions and then more questions and too few answers. Watching the last part of this movie is like reading every other page in a novel and then wondering why the story seems devoid of relevant details.While the movie has promise and the suspense is entertaining for awhile, the abrupt ending and nonsensical plot developments (if it can be called ""plot"") seem to bank on the notion that the viewer's imagination and confusion is all that this movie needs to build a conclusion. Unfortunately this bank is empty. There is no pay off to any time or thought invested in trying to figure out what you've seen. You might as well debate other worldy topics without answers or conjecture about movie sequels that have not yet been written, because Disappearance definately will not have one."
5,Fantastic source,"This is a fantastic reference on medicinal herbs that you probably have growing in your yard or the woods near you. The information on harvesting, preparation, and dosage is more detailed than many of the books out there and very valuable for beginning herbalists."
3,Racist but somewhat Entertaining.,"When Fred Asaire he put on black face, I thought he was Sammy Davis Jr. But that dancing was good and the beginning was quite interesting. But yes, I found it offensive and racist when he put on black face. That was the time though, it would be 10 years later until the blacks got more rights after the war. The beginning started out great, but the ending lagged and had no flow, and it was like fluff and not funny."
2,Slow and boring,"I bought this for my middle school aged daughter who was just learning guitar. We sat down for the first lesson and she was bored to death. The author went into excruciating detail about the parts of the guitar, strings, how to change strings, etc. The presentation was slow and monotonous. We had to quit less than half way through the lesson, and she never actually got to the point of playing anything. This DVD had been the but of family jokes about boring presentations ever since."
2,Track title discrepancy,"Although the review inlcuded here is for the correct album, the track listing included here IS NOT the corresponding track listing for the original ""Greatest Hits Vol 2"" release that the review and album cover posted here are referring to. It's for the alternate compilation released several years later."
5,This mat fills me with delight,"A stupid grin crept on my face when I opened the parcel containing my latest prize. This particular Fiskars self-healing cutting mat replaced my worn out, tired, and beloved Fiskars self-healing cutting mat purchased three years ago.Pro tip: put some double sided tape or friction tape on the bottom so that the mat doesn't scoot around on your work surface. That's the only thing that I can suggest as an improvement on this product.This mat, in particular, is craft-knife safe. Many of the mats on the market explicitly discourage (strangely) the use of anything but rotary knives."
2,Too small on my kindle,"I really like teaching from this book--it is a great method. I have a standard 6"" kindle that I bought the kindle version for, hoping it would be helpful in lessons for a student that forgot their physical book, or new students that haven't ordered a book yet. However I cannot read the music on my kindle. I expected that increasing the text size would make the exercises readable from the distance of a music stand, but it only increases the actual text of the book--not the music portions. Sadly, I won't be able to use it like I was hoping to."
3,Decent Overview,"The video does provide an overview of the three trimesters including a live birth, with interviews with the moms. It's a little outdated and produced from a UK perspective, but then it's always fun to hear the British accents and vocabulary."
2,"Works great for 6 months, then stops working.","This is the second one of these that I've bought. I won't be buying a third. They both followed the same path...work great for 6 months, then they enter a sometimes work/sometimes don't period of about a week, then they die. I think GE has a new model that I'll be trying, but this one, never again."
3,anything with David bowie is great therefore it rocked,"Glam rock and England, two very good subjects combined to make a movie that intrigues the mind and brings back memories. Plus appearences by David Bowie bring the movie its universal appeal. I encourage you to see it. God Bless"
3,Not the best not the worst I've seen,"The storyline was ok a group of friends making a pact to ""come out"" together at end of 30 days and the dilemmas they face in doing so. The acting was mediocre and on par with a low budget film. I guess it was worth the $3.00 I shelled out to watch it on instant video but doubt I'll be buying the DVD."
3,Awful camera/picture work!,"This was actually a really great video with a major flaw - the strange camera/picture work. There is the normal picture of people doing the steps, but then it suddenly switches to this blurry video. Great for actions in movies, I guess, but not good if you're trying to follow steps. The first workout became very annoying fast with a million and one different instructors trying to yell out directions.Otherwise, these workouts are great. The second workout is especially good since it gives a high impact option.Just that blurry picture they insert in the video every so often really gave me a headache!"
1,Hunk-O-Junk,"My wife and I were very dissappointed as our previous blue Dirt Devil was a real powerhouse. We returned not one, but two of these red Dirt Devils.Thinking we had just gotten a lemon, we exchanged the 1st Dirt Devil for another due to our having purchased an extended warranty, we found that the 2nd one had exactly the same problem :It overheats and shuts off after only 5 minutes of use and then you have to wait 10 or 15 minutes to use it again. This is more than a minor inconvenience."
1,Good till is working,"This is my second vac of the same type. It does the job well till it works.Nothing exceptional. Turbo brush is poor. On my first vac the brush attachment stop working within several months, and the whole vac died (motor) just after the warranty period. Unfortunately I already bought several filters so I decided it is better to buy the same model in order to use them hoping for improved quality.My overall opinion at the moment is nor bad or good. I have negative experience with the same model some time ago and I still do not know if my new vac will be better. One may question why there are so many ""refurbished"" 082660 vacs offered at DirtDevil's site?"
5,a definite read for anyone who wants to know,the book is written by a true gentleman and a scholar. There isn't any spin or conspiracy slant in this deeply researched masterpiece
5,great holmes,The Complete Sherlock Holmes CollectionI would recommed this a great buy and I say in two words Its great.
1,Sherlock Holmes,"I recommend this set of DVD's. The quality is very good. I wish that more had been made, but I am glad that I made this purchase. I did have another set of DVD's however I think that I wore them out. My recommendation is to buy this set for your SH collection, you won't be disappointed."
5,The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection,As a fan of Basil Rathbone this is one of the greatest collections a fan can own.
4,UCLA Film Archive Collection,"I've always loved these old chestnuts from the 1940s, though to say they are based on the Conan Doyle original stories is a stretch. But if you accept these Rathbone-Bruce classics for what they are, this collection, assembled and cleaned up beautifully by the UCLA Film Archive, is a great way to build a full collection. The prints are indeed much better than those previously (and still) available at much lower prices. This set is costly by comparison, but I believe its worth it.The bonus material, including commentary on some of the films, is exemplary.I noted some buyers had playback difficulties with some of the dvd's. I had no such problems, but buyers certainly need to keep an eye out so they can return the set if indeed they do find any duds."
1,dont buy it,i odered this movie cause it is a great movie i hadnt seen it in long time.Well i got it but it didnt not work..want play in dvd player wouldnt work in computer.it was a blank dvd.
4,Bought it for the one song.,Yes we all want to be able to hear this song over and over and over again. Now I can.
1,short but sweet,"Although the information in this book is factual, I find that the contents do not match the name of the book. Most of the information should already be known to the tradesman. When looking at a pocket manuel, I am looking for quick referances, pre-figured math tables, and or drawings. A better title for this book would be, Pipefitter's and welder's pocket manuel for beginer's."
3,A gift that keeps on giving,"Although the story behind Roots: The Gift may be completely fictitious, it does provide a look into the cruelty of slavery, the need for freedom, and the ability to change. The cast of characters provides a window into these different aspects of society from the rich overbearing masters to the lowly slaves. (With actors such as Avery Brooks, LeVar Burton, Kate Mulgrew, and Tim Russ, it is a must see for all Star Trek fans.) I found the story moving, especially the climax, which is a endearing scene of self-sacrifice. If one can overlook the exceedingly forced and artificial Southern accents it is an enjoyable 94 minutes."
4,Wonderful Camera,"I'm a fan of Olympus and Canon so I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be such a great camera. The view finder is very good, unlike the 5mp 550, the photos are excellent, it's easy to use, has several movie modes and even lets you use a digital zoom is some of those modes. The battery lasts a good length of time and it pretty quick, even in the highest resolution settings. All the reviews I've read state that it preforms better than the Canon and Olympus cameras of the same MP and general size. My only complaint is that it is heavier then the canons I've used. All in all, it is the best in it's class."
5,The Ultimate Luther,I just wanted to say that you can not go wrong with Luther deep down in my heart. I think this is a really good CD and I would recommend it to any on that likes Luther and I'll give this a 5 plus.
3,Great Watch,"I have had this watch for about half a year now and it is awesome. The style is very nice, numbers easy to read, and it is reliable.Great thing is that I got it for half price compared to every other shop I see it in . . .11/19/11 Update: Still wearing this watch ... and it still works. I have had a bit of trouble with a bend in the button used to set the time. It apparently has bent somehow and it sits a bit crooked when pushed in. This causes it to catch on my pants pocket and sometimes it pulls out the button ... which stops the watch from keeping time until I push it back in."
1,Not so much,"I love Seiko watches, but I hate the kenetic feature. It only works well if you wear one watch. I have several and I like to switch off. This means that I have to reset the kenetic every time I want to wear it. I could put up with this if the watch would stay running while I'm wearing it. Watch a long movie or take a nap and I'm wearing a stopped watch. Bah!"
1,Junk,"This item arrived, and it looks completely ""USED"", it has multiple scratches, actually more than multiple, and the blue and gray paint is scratched off in several places. What a piece of junk, and a waste of time to order, pay for, and get."
2,Clock,I had to have it replaced under warranty within 6 months and then soon after warranty expired so did the clock. I DO NOT recommend this clock or the company. They were very rude and hard to deal with
2,"Distorted, pessimistic view of Cd. Juarez","This book focuses on all the ugly and evil aspects of this border town, and omits anything positive about the place. If you are a reader who has not spent considerable time working or living in Cd. Juarez, this book will grossly distort reality and scare you from setting foot into Mexico. I almost want to write a photo-book myself of all the virtues of the place. Yes, Juarez has it's share of problems, but as the citizens will tell you, things are always getting better. The writing seems very politically motivated, and definitely one-sided. I think someone could write a book just as disturbing while only focusing on slums in american cities. This book doesnt give Cd. Juarez a fair shake. But if you like photos of dead bodies, you will still enjoy this book."
2,Carly Fans buy everything she puts out,"I had to buy this CD,even though I knew ""Let the River Run""was the only vocal from Carly. But the Instrumental,""In Love""is fantasitic. I just want to know if Carly played the Piano on this song? The rest of the tape is just old songs,""I'm so excited,Lady in Red,""and so on... I was sick with the flu when this CD came out,but I still went to the record store to buy it on the day I knew it was comming out. My Mom had to drive me to the Mall because I was so sick. But it was worth it when Carly won the Oscar for,""Let the River Run."" Fans of Carly were so proud of her that night."
2,Glad she's not my ex!,"The book is an interesting account of lesbian life in New York in the 1950s as well as Highsmith's own life of hard drinking and restless yearning. Unfortunately, the style relies heavily on anecdote and innuendo and offers little insight into its enigmatic subject. The book ends on a particularly low note with an ""epilogue"" set twenty-some years later, in which we find a remarkable and unexpected outpouring of venom for the author's one-time lover. Perhaps this writer of ""young adult fiction"" should have stuck to her genre instead of trying to settle the score with a woman who was a quirky but far more talented writer."
5,Multi-Level Revealing,"This is a collection of stories as told by Japanese people who participated in the ""China Incident"" and World World 2. I highly recommend it to those who are interested in this period. I also recommend to everyone to read the story of Uno Shintaro in one way or another. Uno's story is eight pages long. See the title for this review. Sobering."
5,i love this book!!,"If you are depressed and looking for the light well read ""The Me Nobody Knew"", it is about a girl who hates her parent,hates her body hates her life,hates every thing. she slowly finds out the world is not all as bad as she thought and uncovers the peace and love in the world she never knew about. even though she was sexually assulted,critsized by her friends and nearly starved her self to death she still lives on to be the best out there.."
2,just another story...,"I must say that I was highly disappointed with this book. McLinden's writing style was fine, and the book was an easy read, but her problems hardly seemed rare at all. While I'm sure her intention was to write a book that others could relate to, I found her words whiney and at times, annoying. It was almost as though she seemed to be over-exaggerating her problems and trying to get more attention. ..."
5,Touching Story!,"This was a great book. I carried it around school all day and kept reading it. I couldn't stay away. It is about a adolesent with major problems. It is told in a weird way. It isn't exactly told like a story, but like a text book. It is about drinking problems, smoking, weight fassinations, and learning to be you. I loved the way she stood up for herself as she re-gained her self esteam. Great experence for all ages!"
4,All Young Women Should Read This!,"Shannon McLinden shares her story with readers in ""The Me Nobody Knew."" She lets the reader enter her world and experience the real life joys and pains of growing up in today's society. Her message of finding one's true self and triumphing over societies pre-set standards is enough to make everyone want to take a stand for who it is that they are. This should be required reading for all young adults today!"
5,PLEASE NOTE:,"As of this writing, Amazon (in its ""Product Details"" section) mistakenly states the Schirmer 1990 hardcover edition comprises only ""220"" pages. In actuality, this admirable, largish tome (including about 10 prefatory pages) comprises about 500 pages."
5,Great for traveling,"I purchased two of these after spending a lot of time trying to decide which one to get. I bought this one because it has a lot in it, but it's small and compact enough to tuck in a handbag or a tote, or just to put in a suitcase in case a little mending is needed. One I kept for myself, and the other I am giving to my daughter who travels a lot. When visiting her I noticed that she had to borrow a friend's sewing kit in order for me to mend something for her, so my next purchase of this kind is going to be a bigger sewing kit for home. I like this one very much. The case is sturdy and closes good and tight. It's a little smaller than a powder compact when closed. It contains black, yellow, red and white thread, 3 needles, a safety pin, 2 white buttons, 2 snaps, 3 straight pins, tweezers, small scissors, and a needle-threader. It is arranged and looks exactly like it is pictured. I'm very pleased with it."
2,didn't like,"I didn't like them and had to return, because they had to be mounted directly to the wall. Which is not adding anything to decorating :)"
1,Worked for about 14 months,"Bought 2 sets in about 14 months time and both died. I now just pay Dish $5 a month rather than ""invest"" in another set. These are ridiculously priced for how poorly they last."
3,CD-Envelopes,This product I received WASN'T AS ADVERTISED... I wanted Self-Sealing 100-Pack Window CD-DVD-Envelopes. What I received was Plasticized Back-Lip Flap Closure. NON-ZIOTECH AS ADVERTISED...
5,Justin Hayward Does it AGAIN,This is a must for Justin fans! As usual his great voice brings something new to old songs! I love it!
3,Cubicle 3 music,"I can remember falling asleep listening to ""Copacabana"". It was like he was singing it to me and me alone. I loved it because I lived in cabana at the time. I can remember it like it was yesterday. Wait a minute, it was yesterday.Then I went to college and my musical tastes changed. I listened to Carly Simon's ""Boys in the Trees"" non-stop.When I got fired from Target, I went back to Barry Manilow. He made everything seem alright again.Now that I'm almost 40, I really like Captain & Tennille. Love WILL keep us together. Hey Captain -- we know that you're bald. Lose the hat!Gotta go. Mandy's at the door."
1,Save you money,"This product is not worth the paper its packaged in. While the DVD is well produced, the lessons are superficial at best. Its only one hour and the instructor gives little instruction. He assumes you already know what you are doing. Plus, the accompanying written songs are so poorly presented its almost laughable. They include a sheet of paper with the tabs, which are poorly written and difficult to read. For the price I was expecting a nicely printed booklet with lyrics, music and tabs. What I got was a piece of crap. Save your money. I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE, regardless of their guitar experience or ability."
2,dont buy - lacks information,This is a dumbed down version of Janes aircraft and is missing most wwii aircraft. I would not buy this guide ever again.
4,"Good book, good information, good pictures","This book and its inevitable companion ""Vintage Aircraft"" make very good and informative reading. Between them they cover all there is.I didn't give it the 5 stars because in spite of very good photos it does not contain the all-important (to me) line drawings from side, above, front."
2,Nicely constructed - does not work,This was well constructed and looked nice until I put a standard roll of toilet paper into it and it rubbed. I was cheerfully refunded the purchase price and shipping.
4,Messy but good,"I'll start off by telling you what I didn't like about this book:- The writing ranges from excellent to awkward, often shifting even in the same paragraph.- Structure? What structure? It was like watching a squirrel sniff around for food. You know what he's going for and he does get there, but there's a lot of jumping around randomly.So why 4/5 stars? Because it's a thoroughly researched book on a very interesting topic. I love that the author has a lot of historical details about the affected areas and not just simple epidemiology.So in conclusion to a short review, if your interested in the Plague and Medieval Europe (and even parts of Asia), I think you'll find this book well worth your time. But if you're not already interested, this book's odd style and lack of structure will likely not convert you. My own interest and ADD made it a great fit for me. : )"
1,Turkey,Bad lip syncing. And not worth the price.It is painful to watch this cheesy production. Not worth watching if it had been !
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"What a waste of money. I bought it to save on electricity and instead I get to go buy some drywall compound and repaint... plus my clothes are hanging over the back of all my dining room chairs right now. The drywall anchors that came with it promptly pulled right out of the wall as soon as we put any clothes on it whatsoever (leaving quarter sized holes behind). Plus, the first time we have ever tried to use it, the cord started fraying. I would've been better off buying 10 eyehooks and just stringing a clothesline whenever I needed to dry clothes. It would've been cheaper too. I read the other reviews before I bought it, but I thought for 10 bucks it couldn't be all bad. It is. Keep your money. Buy a latte. Just don't buy this!"
2,"Better Solution: Wood, Hooks & Rope","This thing was too flimsy out-of-the-box to bother mounting. A more accurate description might be ""Five-Line Indoor/Outdoor Retractable Toy Clothes Dryer"".Alternative Five-Line Indoor/Outdoor Retractable Clothes Dryer That Works: Two 1""x4""x 2 foot boards + 10 hooks + clothesline. Space 5 hooks evenly across one board. Match the hook-spacing on the second board. Attach the boards to opposite walls. String the clothesline between the hooks, then tie it off. Cost: About the same. Performance: It works... And you can paint the boards to match your decor."
3,Works great but needs a minor correction,I just received my clothes line dryer. Now this is not for any heavy items but will work great for light items. My only suggestions is that the company replace their wall expansion plugs. The ones provided do not expand & will pull out quickly if used. Believe me they won't work. I would have some expansion plugs on hand if you are going to buy this product.
3,"Does the job, but materials are cheap","This retractable clothesline gets the job done - the installation is easy, and it provides a LOT of room for drying clothes. However, the cheap price tag is for a reason, as you can tell the plastic housing is not particularly sturdy, and the lines often get wonky - two lines will remain taut, but the other three get progressively more slack, and it is difficult to adjust them to all have the same tautness. I decided to keep it and continue using it because it was a good price, and I'm only planning to be in an apartment without full laundry for another year or two. But if I were going to live here more permanently, I would have sprung for a similar product sold here on Amazon that got better reviews, but was considerably more expensive (I think in the $45 range)."
3,"Corea's piano great, banjo is outshown","The combination of guitar and and grand piano is an odd one. The compositions are good, Corea's playing is excellent as always, my criticism of the album is that the banjo is too soft an instrument to be paired with a piano. I enjoy the album but it is low key by nature: Corea seems to have to play soft not to overwhelm the banjo. This feature might appeal to acoustic music fans."
3,"Good, not great","This is great for someone that is experienced (intermediate and above). I'm a beginner, and I struggled trying to follow him. I did learn from watching this DVD, but my pause and slow motion button is wore out."
3,stick with romance,"I am a D E Stevenson fan, have nearly all her books. She does best with romance, doesn't shine so well with mysteries. This story is better than House of the Deer, but doesn't measure up to most of her other books. I'll give five stars for the characters (Adam is a great hero), but only three for the plot."
1,"i expected a much larger hook not even 3"" long",very unhappy with these coat hooks they are too small & look like plastic- i suppose they could be bronze- on the other hand there are 2 in each package- as if i needed 10- i would have liked 5 normal size coat hooks
3,Who's responsible?,"I wonder who chose the songs for this compilation. First of all, the three cover songs (Ballroom Blitz, School's out, American Woman) are weak and should have been replaced with original Krokus songs. In fact, they are the only covers Krokus did through their ten album career. The rest of the songs are good, all taken from three albums (One vice at a time, The Blitz, Headhunter). But where are the tracks from albums like Metal Rendez-Vouz or Hardware. Songs like Bedside Radio, Tokyo Nights and Easy Rocker. If your interested in Krokus, buy one of their original albums released between 1980 and 1984 instead. They were a good hard rock band, with AC/DC influences. And a great singer (Mark Storace)."
5,Wow... Just wow...,"Soldiers testifying about their actions during the Vietnam War. Mandatory viewing for anyone interested in the war, or war in general.j.w.k."
2,The actions of a few...,"Sure, some soldiers committed crimes in the Vietnam war. BUT, don't let their professed behavior cloud your perspective into believing it was widespread amongst all combat units. Most of our soldiers served their country with honor and performed the difficult task with dignified integrity. They performed a duty that few wanted to do, they served their country instead of dodging the draft and fleeing to Canada. Remember the atrocious treatment heaped on our soldiers as pow's by the north vietnamese and the countless horrors perpetrated against the south vietnamese people by the north vietnamese and viet cong. We were the good guys."
1,Not the best condition - frustrating to view,"I'm sad to report that this DVD arrived on time BUT... and upon playing for my 4 year old, a very frustrating viewing took place. It pixelated and got hung up on playing the episodes. It took 4 tries to access the menu."
1,NOT a cycling the world book!,"I keep on -- desperately -- trying to support the ""you can't judge a book by its cover"" and last night I have decided with a bit over half a century of reading -- YES you can judge a book by its cover. Every readable author who takes pride in her/his work will take the time and spend the money to find an artist for the cover. This book has cemented that horrid covers = a pathetic book.With this cover I was not expecting the talent of Josie Dew but at least Anne Mustoe. This book reads as if Tammy Baker wrote it. A world 'cycle' journey of 70,400 miles with only 20,000 actually on a cycle is not a cycle journey but a travel book that has a few scenic miles spent on a cycle. This book is a rich woman 'roughing' a journey because her padded bank account had to spend the night with a 4 star motel. You've been warned."
3,William,"Lots of very good pictures of butterfly, but a little bulky for a pocket guide. However, there were pictures of butterflies not found in my other pocket guide."
1,Rubbish,"To me, Gareth Gates symbolises everything that is wrong with the world of manufactured pop. He may be a pretty face if that is what you are into, but there is no substance behind it. His vocals are weak and boring. He lacks passion and obviously has not had a deep emotional experience like the one described in the song as he doesn't have the capability to reproduce it. Definitely one for the under-15s. If it was slightly less bad it would be boring. As it is it is so bad it is kind of funny."
5,Can't Fight Fate,I received the item I ordered in a timely manner. It was packaged very nicely and arrived in excellent condition. I am very satisfied! Thanks for the great service. :-)
3,OK for small low cost led lantern.,"I bought this as Hurricane Sandy was coming and I figured I might need something like this. Sure enough we lost power for 3 days so I had a lot of time to use it and another one similar I purchased.I will say, in an emergency it sure is better than nothing and came in handy. It was easy to charge/crank and worked well.I have to add though that the light output is fine for an emergency but its really only about as bright as the 15-20 watt light bulb in your fridge. Turn the lights off and open the fridge and that is similar to what this will do.Even fully charged it does dim pretty fast but a few cranks and its back up.Overall I am glad I bought it and it will stay in my emergency kit but no hand crank or led will provide the light output the larger 4 and 8 D battery powered lanterns will offer. If you want emergency this is fine but if you want more like real lighting to read by and light the entire room bright, get the D battery ones."
5,Hurricane Equipment,Radio reception excellent. Light bright enough to read by. Night lite setting. Waiting to see if the plastic crank handle holds up.
2,"good idea, horrible quality","The on/off button for the radio works about 1 out of 10 times. The whole thing has a ""made in china"" feel to it. Do not recommend this for emergency situations. For camping on a budget, maybe."
3,The light works great so far.,The only problem I have had so far is that the on/off can be touchy for the radio. The radio doesn't work sometimes.
3,Fun Toy - not exactly durable,"I really love this toy - I am a George fan. It is very cute, and my son loves it.However, the seller we bought it from had said it was ""New"" but 2 days ago we noticed that the back wheel had broken off and after my husband inspected it, he said that it had been broken before and super glued back together. You could see the super glue on the broken edges.I had already left feedback for the seller, and I don't intend on contacting him/her about it because I was desperate to have it for my son's birthday. I am kind of upset though that we were not informed that it had been previously broken and glued back together.So, overall the toy is cute and my son loves playing with it, but obviously if it had broken when the seller had it, and then broke for us, than I would not rate it as very durable."
2,Don't Buy the Hardcover,"A woman who seems lonely and distant starts making a ""shopping list"" as she lets her imagination run where it will. Mrs. Hollingsworth is one of those homemaker type women who doesn't quite seem to understand moderization and who has grown weary of things in her lives that symbolize her unhappiness.Consequently, her daughters find her in a ""surreal fog,"" and the chapter entitled the same is the most amusing of the book.Mrs. Hollingsworth has become disillusioned and her ""shopping list"" is a list of the things she believes would make her life more authentic. There isn't any great plot in this book, though its quite esoteric."
2,Friends and former students rejoice,"This is yet another self-indulgent confection from burned out, Florida-based creative writing teacher Padgett Powell. At times Powell amuses, and his willingness to hurl multi-syllabic dung in the faces of the politically correct crowd deserves praise, but this book like his other reent efforts is intended as a show piece for his students and friends. Check it of the library for an afternoon's diversion, but don't spend a dime on a book that was never written with any other audience than his friends and students in mind.If Powell had more self-confidence and could get over his need to pander, he might amount to something."
1,Not Silicone. Just Expensive.,"These wiper blade refills are actually just ordinary black rubber. They are only covered with a temporary silicone coating. If you are looking for wiper blades made out of silicone like I was, this is not what you are looking for. Very disappointed."
4,An Interesting READ!,"I just finished reading ""Wait for Love""....WHEW!!!! It has hills and valleys that I never hope to see, but it is a reality for some. The way Ms. Wanda wrote the book draws you into the story from the first page. In your quest for love, dear readers, learn from Ms. Wanda Hudson's book and ""Wait for Love."""
2,Long way to get around,"I certainly liked the concept of circumnavitaging the globe on a motorcycle, and the difficulties that were overcome and the people they met were interesting, but there was too much ""homesickness"" to suit me. If you are going to be gone for 3 months, you had better ""man up"" and decide ahead of time you can be without your family before you leave. I don't plan to read the ""Long way down"" as it has the potential to be too much ""down"" and not enough ""long way""."
3,"Imperfect, but enjoyable","I bought this book mainly because of the similarities to Michael Palin's travel books (famous Brit travels the world with a film crew), which I love, and also because I am a sucker for anything on adventure travel. I won't say that I was thrilled with the book, but I wasn't exactly dissappointed either. The writing can be cringingly amatuerish, but the scope and interest of the undertaking is almost enough to make up for it. And you certainly can't fault the writers for their hontesty; in spite of their less-than-adept prose talents (or perhaps because of them) you get a definite feel for them as people, the good and the bad. And they did see some pretty awesome stuff. Overall, I wouldn't put this book in the pantheon of great travel writings, but I will say that if you are susceptable to a bit of wanderlust, it will certainly get you in the mood to hit the road."
2,Wrong way around,"If you are looking for a story about motorcycles, by real motorcycle guys, or about the challenges of a motorcycle ride around the world---This isn't it! It IS a story about a couple of pampered British Socialists who are riding bikes around the world on somebody else's dime. They have an entourage seeing to their every need--they don't even have to pick up their own bikes if they fall off. You won't be hearing anything much about their bikes (BMW's) or the ride itself, or about the nature of the countryside through which they are riding. What you will hear about is their activities in the evenings and whenever they aren't riding their bikes. From that standpoint their story is mildly interesting but I'm put off by their whining and worrying when, if fact, the major burdens of their trip are carried by others. This book is a more a study of the world as seen through the eyes of Hollywood type actors who just happen to ride motorcycles---a motorcycle adventure it is not."
5,Great price!,These are very life like and you can't beat the price. I have looked for many trees for my daughter to play with her animals and they are all so expensive but these are not only cheaper in price but look more real too.
4,M review.,A wonderful introduction. I pray for reunification & doing what I can in this regard. I hope there is a part 2 in the making that goes further with the topics shown in this. DVD. Please let me know if reunification interests you.
1,Very cheap assembly and materials,Bought this wiper blade refill for my Acura RDX. When comparing to original Acura blades - PIAA has twice less rubber and two tiny metal strips on sides that always trying to detach from rubber. Acura blades have metal strip embedded and assembly is solid.When installed into wipers - middle part wipes good but corners miss water removal and you have two unclear areas.So don't recommend this product.
3,Not my favorite,These cookies are moist and are an excellent source of protein but they are not my favorite flavor. Too much chocolate taste and it is not that good a chocolate taste. I prefer the regular chocolate chip cookies.
2,"""magnets wont stay on""",I bought two of these toys last week and I love the design and educational value of this toy . But the magnets wont stay on the back of the gears I called the company and they would not guarantee me that if they sent me out a new box that those magnets would stay on ether.The magnets are a chocking hazard for younger children.
2,Stickers won't stick to them. They keep falling off,"My son really loves gears and magnets so I thought this would be a sure thing. We put these up and they are neat and the concept is good. It just really stinks that the stickers don't adhere very well and fall off. So you will walk in the room and find them stuck to your hardwood floor etc. And then if you have a baby like me, he picks the stickers off of the floor and tries to eat them. Needless to say, I'm not impressed"
4,Can you imagine Fridgigears,"I love Fridgigears. I bought four about 4 or 5 years ago. One for myself and one for each of my kids to put on their refrigerators for their kids. They're still going strong. Every one young and old that sees them on my fridge loves them. Yes, as some reviews have stated the magnets do fall off, though not immediately as someone stated, but if you glue them back with something like Gorilla Glue, you shouldn't have much trouble. The fun they will have with this toy makes it worth having to occasionally glue them back on. I just purchased two more for my grand niece and a friend's grandson. Great toy - the kids will play with them for hours and no mess on the floor."
1,"Fun concept, poor quality","This toy is very frustrating because the magnets keep falling off. I had to tape the magnets to the gears because when I tried to glue them, the glue leaked through holes in the gears and made them stop moving. The stickers that you put on the gears are also very poor quality. Out of all my gears, only one still has the sticker on it. It's very unfortunate because I think this is a cool idea and could be a lot of fun for kids and grown-ups. It's too bad that the company who makes this doesn't feel like quality is important."
2,Does not worth the money,"The magnets are very weak and does not attach well to the fridgeduring normal operation the small friction caused by the gear is enough to move the magnet from their place, which disconnect them from the motorVery disappointing!"
4,Functional Mirror,"It works very well. I would have liked it a bit brighter, but most make up mirrors are not very bright. Also, when you're on it for a while the back gets hot. Other then that Im happy with the product."
2,Feel's Like a Kids Toy,"Panasonic downsized the regular 5.8 ghz phone, and the Battery is Smaller. Range is not as good as the larger 5.8ghz but is ok sound is ok but not excellent. Big problem is that phone is too small and the keypad is more like a cellphone size.How did panasonic let this phone get to development?Not an Improvement. i am returning it and buying the older 5.8 Ghz Panasonic phone (the one with the external antenna).I love panasonics, but sometimes More is More.Jacob"
4,Great audio quality,"The audio quality on this phone system is very good. Clear audio on both the handset, and the base. The audio level on the handset could be just a littly louder (I use it a max). The manual is somewhat hard to follow and they need a ""quick list"" for the most likely items and functions. Deleting all voicemail messages (deleting one is not a problem) requires a journey through the menu system, and is way too difficult.All in all, this is a well built and very good performance system, and at the time I bought it, was the best choice for a home/small business."
3,Good - But Not Great,"As others have written, this is a reliable system and better than most. The CONs which are causing me to strongly look for an alternative is the transmitting microphone is poor. EVERYONE I speak with complains that I sound muffled or with low volume - even though I make every attempt to speak directly, clearly and loudly when using the handset. As a user, I like the phone's features however phone communications have to be good for both parties."
3,"Not bad, not great...","I've been using this phone for about a year now, replacing my old Siemens Gigaset setup, and find myself missing the Siemens phone more and more. While the call quality on the Panasonic is nice, there's plenty about it that has me searching for it's replacement. Their software isn't Mac compatible, the phone's screens stay illuminated while charging (wasteful phantom draw for the greenies out there, as well as acting as a nightlight in a darkened room!), and the handsets just feel... flimsy? It's a decent setup, and it does the job, but I'd look elsewhere."
4,Good phone,"So far I am pleased with this Panasonic model. I had a similar model two years ago and it was a disaster -- the battery life was inadequate and I always had a dead phone. This one is much better.The range is very good, not great. I think my wireless network creates some interference and I get a low hum in the background of my calls. My only real complaint is the lack of speed dial capability in the handsets. With my old Uniden I could call my voicemail to pick up messages by pressing two keys; this phone requires a combination of five or six to accomplish the same thing -- it is actually easier to just dial the number rather than trying to remember the exact sequence of keys required to get there via memory dialing.It is a mystery to me why no one seems to be able to make a great cordless phone system."
3,A Small Place in a Large State,"Texas is a desolate state where Paris is the town with an active, bustling train full of freight cars. Somewhat like the Norfolk Southern but smaller and not quite so loud. It is like the Mohave desert in places. Houston was a metropolis in comparison, where Rodney Crowell grew up. Maybe I was mistaken, but this is the place where Lettie visited Carl during the war years and she was rewarded with a pair of little grannie glasses.Travis went there and got lost, ended up buying some land close to the Red River. He was the typical male, taking no blame for anything and ran from responsibility. These were two damaged souls revived by a child. Afraid of what I might find, it was easier when I just imagined him. Mark is real, but not in Texas."
3,Where's a good editor when you need one?,"This is a fine 90 minute movie. Unfortunately it clocks in at around two and a half hours. What starts out as a slow moody pace fairly quickly becomes dull and the dialogue, which in this kind of movie is so important, tends to be a little flat. That said, it's certainly worth watching. Visually it's beautiful, the soundtrack has a nice lazy Texas twang to it, the story is interesting and there are some pretty good performances, though I don't think it's Harry Dean Stanton's best work. So if you haven't seen it go ahead and pick up a copy and watch it.Just make sure you've had a nap first"
4,Really good read,This was a great book. Both characters and their trust and love for each other developed really well. It was a nice easy read. I enjoy escaping reality and getting lost into books. I was able to do that with this novel. Would re-read.
3,I didnt think this book was the best of the saga.,I didn't like this book that much but I suffered through it to get to Children of the mind. It wasn't as bad as I've read before but I wouldn't read it again. I do suggest you read it to get to Children of the Mind.
2,"The series gets pointlessly longer, unfortunately.","Ender's Game is fantastic. Speaker for the Dead is possibly the best SF book ever written. Xenocide continues the series, but it just coasts along without any of the punch of the first two book. Much happens, the plot moves forward, but in retrospect I wish I had stopped with book two. This book was too plot heavy and too predictable."
2,Lame.,"Ender's Game was amazing. Speaker for the dead was pretty good. Xenocide is pretty bad.I usually like to finish any book I start reading no matter how awful...couldn't finish this one. It was dull and heavy and in some places it's just dumb (ie. The Riots, Everything coming out of that teleportation ride thingy whoosywhatsit.)Skip it."
2,this is junky sci-fi,"I was looking for something for a very long plane flight that was light and fun, requiring no thought. This was perfect for that and I can scarcely remember what I read once I had finished it. It moved along, got complicated, then resolved.It puzzles me why this is seen as classic sci-fi. In my opinion, it doesn't even come close, and underneath there are stereotypes, such as that Chinese are the smartest race, etc...."
3,It's wandering further away from the origional concept...,"... would have been better as a stand alone book. Worth a read on a slow day, but if you think you have something more interesting then read that instead."
4,Xenocide,"The book Xenocide by Orson Scott Card was made with the magnificence of mankind that shows the true meaning of human existence. Card was able to put his deepest thoughts about men into this book. I think this could be called the future testament of the Bible. I should expect this from Card, him being a religious man and all. Xenocide is about the aftermath of a huge war between men and the formics (an alien race). We destroyed them all. Mankind gets a chance to give back what they took when Andrew Wiggen finds a larva of the formics of a queen that lays a lot of eggs to save the formic species. He hatches the larva on a planet that has a rebelling colony. The supreme government sends a fleet to destroy the rebelling planet with the formic last chance for survival. The fleet suddenly disappears. Card put feelings of compassion and love into his most meaningful book yet that will change your thoughts about mankind."
3,Good but will not read again,"I enjoyed Enders Game a lot, but the following books in the series are not nearly as good. Everything gets a little too far fetched - I know, how do you get far fetched from what happened in the first book? Read this and find out.I will not continue to read the other books in the series."
5,Worthy piece of the trilogy,"Before i read the book i was worried from other reviews i have seen that it might not be as amazingly good as the first two books of the trilogy. Now i can say that although it is longer and more complex, it's a worthy continuation of the series. Maybe it would be even better if it was 10-20% shorter, without some thorough descriptions of the characters and their backgrounds, but it is still a very good read."
4,Much more than generic sci-fi,"This series is much deeper than any sci-fi fantasy book that come a dime a dozen. I actually thought this third installment was much better developped than both ""Speaker for the Dead"" and ""Ender's Game"", and I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, ""Ender's Game"" was much more simplistic in style and content. The remainder of the series deals with deeper issues, philosophical and ethical issues, society as a group issues, family values and the like. I'm very much looking forward to see how the series ends."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The other Orson Scott Card.There are two Orson Scott Cards it seems, there is the writer that writes interesting ethical and political explorations, and can be brilliant.Then there is the other, that lets religious pontification get in the way just to a ridiculous level, and as such is horribly tedious and tired. This book is unfortunately an example of the latter to throw in with the Alvin Maker stuff."
2,Yep...,"Overly long and mostly dull :\ I think this book could have easily been combined with the next book in the series (as was the original plan). The bulk of this book consists of the different characters talking in far too much length about things that do not warrant or serve anywhere near so many words and pages. That isn't to say there aren't cool and interesting ideas here. Card is always good at infusing his books with great philosophical, theological, and ethical depth. This time it's just lost in about 300 pages worth of excess material that detracts from the experience (the edition I read was just over 600 pages long).I absolutely loved Speaker for the Dead, Ender's Shadow, and Ender's Game. Shadow of the Hegemon was also more enjoyable than this"
3,Excellent Book.... until the ending.,"I loved this book, couldn't put it down! Until the last 100 or so pages. After many pages of entertaining and deep reading, I was disappointed when Mr. Card jumps head first into a pool of ridiculousness rivaled only by American presidential elections. Oh man. For those of you who read the first two Ender books, this book is a must read as the book has a non-insignificant amount of closure. But be ready to be disappointed by the ending."
1,So Much for the Ender Wiggin Quartet,"I absolutely loved Ender's Game. I was first in line to read Speaker for the Dead, and found it to be not too bad. Not nearly as good as the first, but pretty good. Then, I bought a copy of Xenocide. Then I threw out my copy of Xenocide. You know, I love Orson Scott Card's work and all, but I'll make an exception for this. The storyline set in Speaker for the Dead branches out into all sorts of ludicrous sub-plots. And then the story of Lusitania and the Hive Queen and the Pequeninos and all that gets taken over by that Chinese girl from Path, and it's pretty much downhill. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my hard earned money on this book."
3,Disappointment,Just a let down after the first two in the series. It just didn't hold my interest the way the first two did
3,Slowest so far,It was my least favorite of the Ender books thus far. It seemed as if it was forced by the author. The story was slow. Perhaps more will open and enlighten in the next book revealing why things happened here.
2,it has three major flaws,"Overly religious, poorly explained, prohibitively slow. I think that, the religious background of this story gave a very personal touch and sometimes it was hard to digest. Besides it was far from convincing so, two stars to Xenocide."
2,Does not work with Zen Microphoto!!! BEWARE!!,"This item sucks. I bought this hoping I would be able to charge my Zen Microphoto. While it lights up and looks like it is charging, in fact my Zen Microphoto will not charge with this item. I do not know what products it will work with; but I know for a fact it will not work with the Zen Microphoto. What a waste of money. Great design, poor performance. =("
2,Horrible itching,After searching over and over and trying 4 styles this one works the best. It takes a few tries to get all the hair off my legs. I have had two of these and the button is hard to push. The irritation has been horrible. It warns you that it takes getting used to but 3 weeks of redness and irritation was unbearable. I began scratching after a half a day of shaving. I never experienced this before. Doesn't hold a long charge though im not sure what the standard s but 10 minutes is the most I get.
4,ladies shaver,"Price was pretty high (other advertisers at lower prices didn't actually have any inventory), but shaver works very well. Got a little razor burn one time on underarms. It's getting impossible to find shavers with world-wide voltage. Doesn't anyone travel anymore???"
3,Just OK,"To be fair, I have not yet used the pack, but am preparing to go on a 5 day trip with it. Three things that you need on any backpacking trip- a tent, a sleeping pad, and a sleeping bag. But there is no room for these three items! Right now I'm just lashing the tent and sleeping pad to the the frame, but that leaves no space for my sleeping bag. I could sort of bungee/lash it below the sleeping pad, but it then would rest against my rear end while hiking and would sit on the ground each time you put the pack down. The pack looks cool and there are plenty of individual compartments, but I have to believe there are better packs out there with a better design.Also, you can get this pack much cheaper on other sites."
1,What a waste of money,There are not that many documentaries out there on Latin America and when you find one you expect a lot more than this. Not only is it poor quality it is also so over priced. For that price I would have expected at least 7 or 8 hours at least not a DVD of less than 1 hour. My advise is. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD you will only be wasteing your money.
2,mislabeled on site,"Be careful with this ink cartridge, to be sure you get the correct one for your machine.I have an Epson 4880, not a 4800. In some places on the site and on my order, it is listed as for the 4880. That is not true. This is actually ""light magenta"" not ""VIVID light magenta"" and can only be used in the older model.I like to keep my ink stocked ahead, and by the time I put it into use, it was too late to return it. Waste of a lot of money!Buyer beware..."
2,Where's the rest of the soundtrack,"God! you missed the opening track from the Band Cruzados, music legend Tito Larriva(Tito & Tarantula)It's Don't throw stones!Very disappointed cause you can't locate that track anywhere."
4,worthwhile just for the Jeff Healey cuts,"I don't normally care for soundtrack albums, but hearing Jeff Healey do ""When the night comes falling"" was too much to resist. The four Jeff Healey cuts make this CD worthwhile. They are so good that the rest of the stuff doesn't matter. In fact the other cuts make nice filler to space out the good stuff -- like listening to a radio station that alternates things you really like with other stuff you can just tune out."
2,Got Lost,I got bogged down in the politics involved in the beginning and never did get into the presonalities of the characters
5,Best study of lincoln,"Many people have written about A Lincoln but this is the best study of the man I have ever read. I have no doubt many current historians have ""borrowed"" from this book for theirs. It was written within 50 years of Lincolns death so people alive at that time had some memory of the events surrounding and encompassing his presidency."
5,A Truly Great CD!,"I just got this CD today and I love it!!! I have listened to Jump5 since the day that they came out. It was kind of sad that Libby left the group. Anyway, Jump5 is a great band that deserves a lot more attention. They have great music and are very talented. I own every Jump5 CD and I reccomend them all to anyone who loves dance pop music. This CD includes all their hits and I love every song on it. It includes three new great songs."
2,jump5...jump4?,"I used to LOVE Jump5, but after Dreaming in Color and Libby left, I find them not very Jump5-ish. This CD is stupid! WHY BUY THIS WHEN YOU HAVE ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ON THE OTHER CDS!?!?I mean...I think I will still buy this CD, but why didnt they make a new one?"
3,Works fine for a class,"I took a community college class online that used this for the textbook. I read the negative reviews (this and other editions), but for what it was supposed to do, it did it perfectly. I had a positive experience and I learned the three programs. What's to complain about? Yes, there were a few mistakes, minor ones, like in one example the book forgot to tell us to add the fourth line, and then told us to manipulate it. Well, that's not the end of the world. Between the text and the examples, it explained everything adequately. It's not that bad."
2,One classy instrumental ....................,"This album produced top ten country hits, but the best thing on the album is the instrumental final track, ""Poultry Promenade"". Written by lead guitarist Jimmy Olander, it sounds fresh and innovative, and leaves you in no doubt that these guys can really play. Apart from here, it is only found on ""Platinum Collection"" and ""Super Hits"", so if you don't have those albums or this one, the mp3 is a few clicks away."
4,Lorenzo grows up,"It was inevitable: Lorenzo Jovanotti grows up, has a kid and wants to sing about it. Luckily, he's not stuffy or insufferable and still likes to rap. But there's a sweet side to this one and he's still cooler than most people on the planet. Even if he's got bushy hair and a beard. A neo-hippie? Recommended for those who like word play and subtle beats, and you don't have to speak Italian, although it helps. Great phrase: ""Funky beats/funky beato!"""
1,i hate disco!,terrible cd. if i could sample the songs before buying i would have never bought this cd. i took a chance and lost big time. i found myself skipping through every song trying to find at least one that was not disco. awful cd.
5,Perfect gift,"I bought this as an anniversary present and was stunned at the high level of quality. The watch face is mother-of-pearl and catches the light so many different ways, and the diamonds catch light in still others. The silver case offsets well with the black band with all of the light bouncing around. I love seeing it on my partner's wrist, cause I know that I got a great deal on a great piece of quality jewelry."
2,How Dull,Yeah it's got indie cred plus Gere but that equals boredom rather than drama - there's no intensity and nothing at stake for the characters or the viewer - pass.
3,Pleasantly diverting,"I enjoyed the movie, but I would have appreciated a more, dark-hearted villain from Richard Gere. He was a scalawag, of course, but there always seems to be a gleam in his eye that makes you want to pat him on the head or run your fingers through his hair. Also, it wasn't clear whether his wife reported him or not at the end of the movie - if they could even bring charges against him with her testimony, that is. The SEC is so incompetent these days -- there are probably a few thousand more like him still on Wall street enjoying their ill-gotten gains."
1,"Some good actors, terrible script","Some good actors, terrible script.. pretty much a waste of an hour and a half. Left me wondering why i watched it."
4,"twist, turn, and suspense!",Don't even try to figure out the ending. In fact you may have to re-wind in a few spots to better hear what is being said. Enjoy!
4,"Better than I thought, except for the end...","I'm not a huge Richard Gere fan but figured I'd give it a try anyway. While the story was predictable and there were no twists, it kept us interested to see how it was going to play out.I tend to stay away from Lionsgate films solely because their endings always suck and this movie stayed true to that thought. The ending SUCKED. I want a little more closure than what it gives. Not sure if Lionsgate people think they are being tricky with their endings or what but all they do is annoy me."
3,Richard Gere is Past His Prime,"The movie is very predictable, but Richard Gere is past his prime and probably should consider other roles to expand his talents. When I began to watch this movie I thought I had seen it before, but realized I had seen Richard Gere in this situation or role before."
3,Savor the whine,"Aah, I thought I knew what was going to happen. I didn't. Not gonna tell. My jaw dropped once or twice. The writing is swift, sure, knowing. Played well. Highly innovative? Deeply creative? Waaal, mebbe not. But, like hearing familiar music played with gusto, sometimes it's better than an earnest creative effort. The scenes played seamlessly in to each other, dialogue worked from tension to reveal in swift, evocative steps. Nice work."
4,Good movie,It was a good movie and from what I can remember you could get closed caption which is the norm for me but some other places don't offer.
3,I love Richard Gere,"I love Richard Gere in anything. This movie was intriguing but a little hard to follow. I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it, but will say it was a little disappointing. I'll just say, Thanks Amazon for featuring this movie on line. I'm happy I didn't waste movie money to see it."
2,waste of time,"Key elements in the file were left unexplained. Waste of time despite good acting. Unless you are studying Gere's work and need to see the film for academic purposes....move on. His acting is good, but there are other films he's done that were much, much better."
1,What?,Susan Sarandons roll was minimal. Watched it because I typically like Richard Gere. Plot was to predictable. I guess the mistress got what she deserved??? Ending was terrible. We felt like we were left hanging.
3,OH WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE,"It is always nice to get out while you are on top, before you are caught with your finger in the pie. This is what a dishonest, cheating Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is attempting to do. This is a semi-crime drama that comes at you rather fast with no time for character build up. Robert Miller is unlikeable, but the film doesn't build character for anyone else. I found myself rooting for minor characters who are more honest than Miller, but not puritanical.Brit Marling as the overly smart daughter played a convincing role, but Susan Sarandon as the wife did not have the lines she needed to excel. The individual scene dialouge was predictable. The film is more of a crime drama with the financial empire and deals being part of the background dealings setting up Gere's character.Might be worth watching once. A film you will forget an hour after you have seen it. Not a keeper.Parental Guide: F-bombs, brief sex, no nudity"
2,ZZZzzz...,"Richard Gere stars as a millionaire Wall Street financier with big troubles at work and a dead mistress, too.It's always a bad sign when I have to look up the meaning of a movie title after seeing the movie and still don't know what it means. This was a big disappointment, although the acting was excellent. Richard Gere is always a pleasure to watch; he's confidant, capable, and charismatic, giving a very good performance as a single-minded and unscrupulous man. The problem here is the script, which is confusing and boring, and gives us no one to root for. None of the characters are likable and most of the dialogue consist of muffled references to Big Trade Deals that we aren't meant to fully understand.The story paints a believable picture of a powerful man who can buy anything except, of course, his family's love. The movie is predictable and only interesting in brief spurts; basically, it's an unsympathetic and dull story. Recommended only for those who find high finance interesting."
3,Thank God crime pays,"If at the end of this movie Richard Gere's character did not get away with his crime, I would have been sorely disappointed. I like Richard Gere but I am glad I did not pay to see this movie in a theater."
2,Not as good as the trailer.,This movie was not as good as the trailer made it our to be and you'll be disappointed with the ending.
2,Ho hum...,Not even Richard Gere could save this predictable and flat movie...why all the hype??? Susan Sarandon seems to think she's still 20...
1,joC,"I was unable to watch the full movie, dispite tech service calls x 2 to amazon...It was interesting but I don't know how it ended. Error message unable to continue at this time got pretty annoying. One star rating for delivery method, movie was a good watch..for the first 20 minutes"
3,"Wait unit it is ""out of theaters""","This movie looked interesting. I thought it was going to be more of a detective mystery. I also thought there would be more of Tim Roth. This was an average movie. Good plot, interesting characters, etc. Just not that exciting. If you go into it realizing it is more a story of how if you have enough money you really can get away with anything, then you will enjoy it. If you think like I did that it will have some suspense then you will be disappointed."
2,Watchable but I could have waited for it on HBO,"If you like to watch the excessively rich use their money and influence to get what they want, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it's a story like we've seen many times before. I didn't find Richard Gere's character very likeable nor Susan Sarandon's for that matter. We watch the conflicts in their lives based on the choices they make. It all works out in the end and everyone is relatively unscathed from the events that transpired. There aren't any chilling thrills. There's only one slight ""aha"" moment when we learn how the young man was framed by the police.If you're selective about the movies you're willing to pay theater prices to see, don't put your money down on this one. Wait until it comes out on HBO."
4,Loved everything except the ending,"I love Richard Gere and I thought the movie was great. He's still got the ""IT"" factor to me. However, maybe I was up too late but the ending left me thinking ""what the hay"". It just basically ended...and that was that."
2,Forgettable,"An excercise in mediocrity. Well shot, well acted, well written and utterly forgettable, irrelevant and MEH. It's a shame, I was looking forward to this one..."
4,Thumbs Up,"Overall a good movie, both Richard Gere and Tim Roth were very believeable, the plot thickened as the story unfolded which enhanced the suspense. A definate must see."
3,A Mediocre Movie at best!,"Not much to say! I like staring at Richard Gere, but this movie was just sort of blah. I watched the whole thing and I didn't think it was bad, but honestly it's been 3 months since I saw it and I hardly remember a damn thing about it either than thinking huh, that was not as good as I expected. Boring! If there is nothing else to watch then go with this!"
3,Bonfire of the Vanities Meets Bernie Madoff,"This is an entertaining film that is mostly dominated by Richard Gere's performance as a hedge fund magnate who experiences unexpected personal complications while attempting to sell his company to a rival firm. In the process of the sale some secrets about Gere's company begin coming to light, along with the aforementioned personal complications. Gere's character spends a large part of the film trying to keep his secrets under wraps long enough to close on the sale of his company, and thus escape with a golden parachute. Of course there are obstacles. The police, company auditors, his daughter, his long suffering wife and the son of a former employee all stand in his way. This movie is worth seeing due to the interesting plots twists and Gere's strong performance as a beleaguered billionaire struggling to keep it all together."
2,Really?,Movie was good right up till the very end. Why do they continue to make movies that have no conclusion?
2,Predictable,Bad writing and acting. Predictable plot with nothing interesting to say. There's no depth to the characters. Kind of a mix of several stories from the headlines like the Madoff scandal.
2,Good flick except for ...,"Fine movie. Intricate story. Gets quite complex. Betrayals. And, then it just ends ... it was like the producer didn't know how to end the movie, but he did it anyway. All kinds of strings left untied."
4,ARBITRAGE REALITY,"I FOUND THE MOVIE TO BE VERY GOOD, SO GOOD THAT I WATCHED IT OVER & OVER UNTIL RENTAL TIME EXPIRED!"
2,Arbitrage,Too predictable and boring. The story line has been used in other movies. No surprises or twists and turns. Love Richard Gere but this wasn't one of his best.
3,it was OK,"It was an interesting story, but not really how I would expect a billionaire to act. I also felt that the ending was incomplete."
2,Horrible ending.,To predictable and they must have run out of film since there was no ending. I would not recommend this movie.
3,All you need is 10 minutes,Just watch the 10 minute preview that's all you need to know about the entire movie. The remainder of the 2 hours is boring.
4,Solid Thriller,"Richard Gere does a good job playing a rich, powerful hedge find manager who finds himself on the wrong side of a number of transactions. The character is easily detestable; Gere brings his good parts out. Fine supporting cast. Some plot twists are implausible, but that does detract from the overall enjoyment."
3,Arbitrage is okay.,"I liked the film but thought it was a little weak on plot. However, it still kept me on the edge of my seat and I would recommend it"
2,A little disappointing,"A stock movie about corporate greed. Susan Sarandon, as usual, does the most with what she's given. This movie has no redeeming characters. It ends badly. I only gave it two strs because of Sarandon."
4,Arbitrage,Great movie. We really enjoyed it. Had some difficulty with the transmission towards the end of the movie. The movie seemed to be skipping or dragging some.I would recommend the movie to others.
2,boring,This show was boring. I wondered why it was available to rent while playing in the theater. It would probably only be interesting to Richard Gere fans.
2,Ho Hummm..,"Let's just say this is not some of the better acting I've seen from Gere and Serandon. They make a lovely rich couple, and the scene with Gere cheating on her is, well... steamy and fun.The rest kept my attention, but only because they are my two favorites and I was waiting for something of significance from them."
1,Are you joking?,"The real name of the movie on the cover of this DVD is 'Los Murciélagos' ('The Bats') from 1964... Alma Delia Fuentes and Joaquín Cordero did not make 'Hasta el Viento tiene Miedo' (1968)... I'm not going to buy this DVD just because that simple reason... I am still waiting for 'Más negro que la noche' and the real 'Hasta el viento tiene miedo' DVDs; Carlos Enrique Taboada made both, not Juan José Ortega... a quick visit to the IMDB can erase any doubt about it... The only thing to trust in this page is the Description of the movie..."
3,I have never used a product like this ...,I have never used a product like this before. I do get headaches often and these pads did seem to relieve some of the tension without medication. I also felt more relaxed after using it. I would recommend it for those who have headaches and are looking for a non-pill solution.
3,Not as good as Other AG products,This lotion works fine for sun protection but I'm not a fan of the gel spray. The bronzer doesn't do ANYTHING for my color and it doesn't work in keeping me dark like other basic products I've used from Australian gold.
5,Best Bronzer,Australian gold beats all the odds. It not only protects my skin with the 15spf but leaves it tanned and golden. It's has a great moisturizer formula and doesn't leaves the skin dry. Great fragance!
4,China's best import musically,"This cd shows off her range from ballads to dance hits (Wanna Be Yours and Stand Up Go Go have a little English and Hindi in Stand Up Go Go for those that want it, afterall Malaysia is multilingual). She may be best known for dance songs but the ballads showcase her beautiful voice and the emotion she can convey. I got the import version from Malaysia which also came with a dvd and a photo booklet. I have since somehow lost the cd and miss it and am looking to replace it now since it was so good.Wanna Be Yours is a great dance song and would be reason enough to buy but the song Happy Girl is smooth and alluring. The video is worth watching although the making of ... part is the typical canned production and should be skipped over."
4,GE Security TouchPoint Key box,"Box is of excellent quality, and the price is not bad for what you are getting. Only problem is that I own several of these, and have had problems with the key pad breaking. Good news is that you can replace (easy fix), bad news is it is approximately half the cost of the box (~$30.00)! As with most thing when they break, I love to take them apart to see the point of failure. In this case, the plastic parts inside the key pad were broken (and cannot be repaired without parts, which they do not sell). Anyway, I love the box, and can finally keep all my keys organized - in one place!"
5,What a wonderful Treat,"I love Family Affair. I like seeing real family values and the way thechildren showed respect for adults back then. Its nice to watch theinnocence of this show and not think about 9/11, the War in Iraq, andseeing so much tragedy America seems to be faced with today. Iam so greatful this show is finally on DVD, I been waiting a long time."
5,Takes me right back to my childhood!,"We REALLY LOVE these! I thought my daughters might enjoy seeing what I liked as a kid but I have to say they far exceeded my expectations. The quality is great, but nothing beats snuggling together as we all fall in love with Buffy & Jodie, they are too cute!My sister borrowed them & they couldn't watch them fast enough. Fabulous family entertainment with values! Where is that today? Certainly not on MTV. Highly recommend them. You won't be sorry."
1,Hmmmm. I wonder if this will be like another Patrick Dempsey...,"Campus flick where he teaches everybody the 'cool, new dance' he got from a National Geographic type show? Okay, I'm just saying Patrick Dempsey? Uber-nerd from the 80s? As JFK? Well, I'm quite sure he's buried his past in film to be the right man to play JFK. Okay, just as long as JFK doesn't give money to the most popular girl in school so she'll look like she's dating him. Who knows - maybe Kirstie Alley will appear as Marilyn Monroe, so Patrick and her can have a 'comic-reteaming' after another movie they did in the 80s (Loverboy). Okay, okay, just as long as JFK doesn't hit it off with one older woman, and through the grapevine, become a gigolo of sorts who just talks to and dances with the older women - you know, what gigolos did in the 80s. It was all so watered down. Just like this. You've been warned!"
3,BIBLICAL BLOCKS,"Although the quilt blocks were pretty, I found the choice of fabrics required rather restrictive. Also the alternate squares were not what I personally like."
2,Lousy marinade.,"Pretty good and inexpensive steak sauce.Effective marinades have to have a significant acid content, typically vinegar in order to tenderize/break down the meat. This mix doesnt qualify, and you can leave your steak floating in this stuff for 3 days and it will taste the same off the grill as if you had let it soak for 3 minutes. 2 Forks"
2,don't like this cd,I don't like the song selection and the way he sang the x'mas songs. I am sure he is good singer but not for me in x'mas songs
5,From the Publisher - Luna Imaging Inc,This publication was released in 1995 and the software was designed to work on Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. It seems to function on windows 2000 and below.It does not run on Windows XP and Luna Imaging no longer provides support for this product.
4,Diplomat for The Dead,"This is a truly mighty compilation- a unique tool for the seasoned Deadhead to use for sharing great Dead songs with the uninitiated.As a life long lover of the Grateful Dead, I would be the first to admit that, although the Dead wrote some of the finest rock ballads and party anthems ever penned, they rarely recorded very well in the studio.This album is a chance to hear what some of their finest works could have sounded like if the Dead had been really good in the studio."
2,Battery wears out long before the trimmer,"I had a bad experience with an FX789W. It was at least OK at first, but soon the battery began to fail. The trimmer is great, but I had to throw it out because I can only get 2 very weak minutes out of a fully charged battery. And the battery cannot be replaced.The bottom line: the trimmer works great, but Babyliss deliberately forces customers to buy a new one loooong before it wears out. If it had replaceable batteries, it would be my favorite trimmer."
2,10 bucks for a tune?,"Come on people, this album is not THAT great! The title track and especially ""Mais Qui Est la Balette?"" are phantastic, but the whole thing is quite invariant and I quickly got really tired of the album. So - one star per good track, and I still question if the album is worth 20 bucks..."
1,"unusable with win2k, bad s/w","this device is totally unusable under the win2k o/s. i bought it for capturing feature movies, but the s/w is too primitive to be of any use. it doesn't have any provision for splitting the output stream into multiple files, so you get a giant single file that can only be split using very expensive s/w that is not included. to be honest, i can't see any other use for this product since there are many other products dedicated to home movie transfer. go out to the creative support site and try to find any information regarding this product running under win2k -- nada, zilch, squat. i will be returning mine for a refund immediately. all in all, a hastily released product. i don't think the other reviewer actually used the thing, since you have to install the s/w drivers before you hook up the usb cables (his review clearly states he hooked up the usb before installing the s/w)."
4,Dog toys,Cheapest dog toy that our destructo dog likes to demolish.Hard to find now. Used to be at Walmart but they don't carry it any more.
5,I love this CD!!!,"This CD is just perfect. I listen to almost everyday. Being my age(12), my family finds it amazing that I listen to Candy Dulfer. So I just have to say, ""How can I not like a CD this cool???"". I say I would recommend this CD to everyone I know. In fact, I DO recommend it to everybody I know."
4,sax,"Good music. Glad that I purchased it. Very sexy, too....as only a saxaphone can be. I first heard this when she originally released the album. Now...years later, I found it on CD. My grandson plays the sax, he also enjoys the music."
1,Returned it..,"The quality of the parts in this were not bad but there were 2 major flaws. First, it did not fit in my truck. It was the right part for my truck but the locking mechanism was too wide for the latch by about 1/4 inch. Could have been just a flaw but I'm not sure. Second (and the reason I did not order another) is that once I saw how it installed it was clear that it would take all of 5 seconds to disable it manually. Just pop off the plastic latch bezel and move the lock out of the way - all by hand with no tools. Not very secure."
4,Works great...just really slow!,"This is definitely a trickle charger. I had it hooked up to a completely dead battery for 2 days, and my Mazdaspeed6 started right up! Impressed with the device since it is a LOT cheaper than alternatives. Don't purchase if you have a vehicle that you need to run within a day."
3,"Good, but sometimes hard to follow","It is a good beginner to int work out with plenty of motivation for more shapely women. Some moves are not explained well before they are done so A little confusing, but it got me sweating"
5,"Amazing, to be so profound and remain so funny.","It is hard to do this book justice.Anyone who enjoys the humor of Douglas Adams' novels will laugh almost as often through ""Last Chance to See."" Yet there is so much more. Adams recounts true traveling experiences and describes human characters in a way that brings cultures and continents alive better than a National Geographic Special. His descriptions of the sought-after endangered animals are equally compelling, biologically accurate without being overly elaborate or dry. Remember, this is Douglas Adams, you WILL laugh.Adams' discussions are thought-provoking and profoundly insightful, revealing much about the author while encouraging the reader to reflect on his/her own position--philosophical and natural. Anyone who has heard of Douglas Adams or Komodo dragons will love this book. And grow through reading it."
4,Gaining Knowledge and Adventure,"Although reading isn't my thing, this book was a good book and I would read it again. It portrays both adventure and knowledge of animals that people probably never even think twice about. It made me see animals in a different way, especially the endangered ones. It was a good book because it was also entertaining at some points and it gave information and cool pictures on endangered animals such as the giant Komodo dragon, blind river dolphins, white rhinos and the rare of birds. It kept me interested throughout the book because every chapter was a new adventure. If you like animals you would especially like this book and if you don't, it could change your mind."
4,Excellent read - humorous yet depressing!,"Expertly written and Adams interjects not a little humor into an otherwise depressing topic. I wouldn't mind a slightly longer treatment of some of the animals seen, and an afterword detailing the sad demise of a couple of them would be welcome."
2,Very dissapointing,"This was a weak very weak follow up to her previous 1987 hit ""Whitney"". Many poor tracks. Best track is All The MAn I Need.Whitney, drugs can ruin your voice and that is clear that thats what happened here. AVOID DRUGS AND THIS ALBUM!"
4,Nice Platform Slide,"I like the extra height these platforms give me; I purchased them in my usual size 8, but I was sliding out of them too easily and was afraid of falling (that's why I gave them 4 stars). But I liked them enough to exchange them for a size 7, which fit me much better. I've worn them for only 2 days so far -- they are heavier than regular shoes but not too heavy and I think I'll enjoy wearing them."
2,Cheap Stuff,"I would not recommend this if you have the need for a tester frequently. However, if you need something for home to be used once in a 'blue moon' by all means this is for you. For my purposes this is cheap stuff."
5,Simple carbon pile load tester,"This device is a carbon pile load tester.A carbon pile load tester works by applying a calibrated load to the battery (the load is essentially a large carbon resistor that heats up when voltage is applied).To properly test using this method, the battery must be at least 75% charged. A good battery should be able to supply half its cold cranking amps (CCA) rating for 15 seconds without dropping below 9.5 volts (if you want to test batteries that are not fully charged you'll need to purchase an electronic tester which tests by measuring the internal resistance of the battery.)IMPORTANT NOTE: This unit (by design) will get hot and might initially produce some smoke if there is any foreign matter on the resistor element."
4,I like it,With a golf cart and several lawn tractors and of course my vehicles this has been a great asset to my tool chest
3,The non-Rabin tracks are pretty good,"Union is hated by many Yes fans but as I listen to it 20 years after it came out, I like most of it. I don't like the songs by Trevor Rabin at all, but the rest of the tracks are good. Not as good as those on the Keys To Ascension album, or from The Ladder, but much better than those on Talk or Open Your Eyes."
4,For fans of the Rabin years and ABWH,"This CD is generally reviled by most die-hard Yes fans, and even the band members themselves (most notably Steve Howe) have slammed this album. I strongly disagree. I REALLY like this CD, and the songs penned by Rabin (Saving My Heart, Life Me Up, Miracle of Life, and one other I can't recall), are among the strongest songs on the CD. But it doesn't stop there, because there are 5 or 6 other winners on this CD.If you like the Rabin years of Yes, you should find a lot to like on this CD, as even the songs written by Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe seem to be emulating Rabin's style for at least a few of the songs.I'm a big fan of Rabin's tenure in Yes. So I love this CD. But musical tastes being what they are (and since this is the one Yes album NOT available on iTunes), I'd steer clear of it if you didn't like what Rabin did to Yes."
4,"Rick calls it ""Onion""","Rick calls this album Onion, because he cries every time he hears it. Apparently Studio musicians were on most of the ABWH tracks.I personally like it except for a few songs that are horribly dated.The More we live (Let go), Lift me up, Miracle of Life are all from the ""west"" Yes and are in the same league as 90125."
1,Rick Wakeman referred to this project as Onion....,"... because it made him cry. Bruford thought that it had so devalued the merits of a band he cofounded that it closed the door forever on any prospect of working with his former mates again.Through even a cursory listen, this is clearly the lowpoint in Yes's career. Indulgent, cliche ridden and corporately fueled and designed, it's an abomination. I don't know who Jonathan is, but hopefully by now someone has fed him to the sharks.To second Wakeman's observation, this stinks."
3,Surprise ending?,"OK- the plot takes us there, the self-conscious feel of a small town in the South, multiple murders and a secret that threatens at every turn. In the end you smile and put the book down. Yes, it's expected, and yes you can't help but feel a little cheated. However, the first few chapters introduce the reader to such possibilities that I can't help but think that Steve Vance is on to something here."
1,Maybe the worst book I ever read.,"This might have been the worst book I ever read. It had some characters, scenes, and plots that showed promise, but they didn't really go anywhere, and the ""surprise"" ending was just surprisingly stupid. Don't waste your time."
2,"This is probably good for fine hair but not for 4abc Natural Sistahs, use the SERUM instead.","I like IC products, and I luv the Serum. I have 4b hair and this product just seems to dry it out. I think because it's in a spray form. I'm sure it's perfect for finer textured hair. Know your hair, then choose the best product for YOU. Not what works for everybody else. I will simply pass this on to someone else who wanted to try it.\"
3,Rotary Tool Stand (Mini Drill Press for a Dremel),"This is a light weight tool, but is well suited for model making and the drilling of small parts. The overall quality of the assembly is lacking somewhat. the plastic control parts are weak, but if you are handy, you can rebuild them with stronger materials. It is essential that the unit be mounted on a larger base and that this base be clamped to the work table. Failure to do so could result in damage and or injury. I have taken steps to correct these issues. I am presently using the unit to drill hiles in jewelry and carvings.The price is fair for the quality of goods recieved, and met my needs. However if you are looking for absolute precision, this unit will not measure up."
3,Could Be Better,"The Milescraft Rotary Tool Stand is advertised to use as a router and drill press. However, I bought it mainly to cut bathroom/kitchen wall tile and it does the job well. With the right bit and a little practice I found that I can cut curves, straight lines and cut-outs with ease. I did not have to bolt down the stand because I use only slight pressure to move the tile through the cutting bit. But, I will probably fix it to a board for a little more stability anyway. In this application I would give it 4 stars. However, the parts do not fit together well and the cord holder broke when trying to push it into the post. Also the base is not very smooth. Because of the poor quality I gave it 3 stars."
4,"Good tool for the price, YMMV.","The press works pretty well. To echo some earlier reviews, it does have a ""cheap"" feel to it. The rotary tool holder does seem to ""walk"" a little bit when drilling. I am using this to drill circuit boards, so fine precision is not that big of a deal. The base plate is cast aluminum and has a rough look and feel to it, as it is, I will probably take the time to finish the base. The cord retainer at the top of the pipe is very loose and does not really hold the cord well. I wire-tied mine to the top and that fixed that problem."
3,well I thought it said it would work,"there is no way I can use this with my new dremel 400 xpr, I really thought I had read that it would work, anyway the mounting on the press is to small for the dremel so I have no idea how well the stand works."
5,Perfect stand for home hobby use,"This rotary tool stand is ideal for casual use by the home hobbiest, and easily fits both the Dremel and Black & Decker rotary tool lines. The only weak point for me was the plastic collet nut that holds the rotary tool in place, which stripped out after a few months of hard use. But Milescraft has great and responsive customer service, and they promptly sent out two replacement collets -- for free!"
3,"Good idea, poor usability","Main ""spy"" feature missing -- one-touch activation. You push ""On"" button, wait for 5 second for Windowz to load, then push another button to select function (someone guessed that it's good to save last function, many thanks!), then push record button.On the other hand, if you keep it turned on, with function selected, LCD display does not turn off after some reasonable timeout (though it does during audio playback !), so the battery dischanges quite quickly in this mode.I think they should make firmware update if they want higher ratings. If I had more time I'd try to fix those usability bugs myself.Overall, it's a funny thing, I'm satisfied, though, I cannot say it exceeds expectations."
2,Lacks Functionality,"A cool little gadget, i purchased it back in May 2002 (I figured it was a pretty good deal). Was it? Not really. Good things include: Small and compact, can take pictures and stores audio...but that's it. There is no zoom! There is no darklight function. It records to MPEG 4 format, which is very similar to a streaming video that you would see on the internet. So basically, the video quality is [bad]! The software is lacking everything. Overall, save a few extra bucks and buy a real camcorder. This one is one that you'd give to you 4-year-old."
5,A joy to read!,"Peter Levitt's latest book, Fingerpainting on the Moon, is a joy to read! Every word reflects his love of language and gift as a master storyteller. A longtime fan of Peter's poetry, I was delighted to find that his words of wisdom are as applicable to my everyday life as they are to the creators he inspires. Lessons about love of learning and work and play, the freeing of imagination, and the taking of risk are told through stories and exercises gleaned from a lifetime of contemplation and engagement. Perhaps Peter's greatest message for us regards inspiration - don't sit around waiting for it, just get out there and do what you love! Give yourself time and space when you sit down to read this book; you're not going to want to put it down."
3,Warning!,"I am a huge Bob fan. I have tried to collect all legally available live recordings, and this is the best (only?) place to get the live version of ""Song To Woody"". But it has a skip at 2:54. I complained, and Amazon.com was very helpful and sent me another copy that also had the same skip. So they sent me another copy that also had the same skip. So they referred me to Sony Music Customer Service, who were not terribly helpful, but did send me another copy. With the same skip. Everything else on this CD is available elsewhere so I would say this disc is for nut case completists like myself only. But even to those like me I say, beware the skip."
4,Good job Bob,"""Things Have Changed"" is a Dylan song in the style of ""Time Out of Mind"" and is excellent, as expected. The live version of ""Song to Woody"" is a rare live gem that is worth more than the price of this CD. ""To Make You Feel My Love"" is a good, solid version typical of his live shows. It is nothing outstanding, but is a welcome addition to the scarcity of commercially-available live tracks. It is incomprehensible why ""Hurricane"" -- lifted directly from the ""Desire"" album -- was included. It fits this disc neither in theme nor style, and detracts from the total listening experience. What was Columbia thinking? 5 points for Dylan, 4 for the compilation."
4,Good little nuggets here,"While ""So Close"" and ""Don't Hold Back Your Love"" are definite keepers on this album, there are a couple more that make it very worthwhile. Notably, ""Starting All Over Again"" is a catchy remake worth hitting the repeat button for, as is the jazzy ""Halfway There,"" guaranteed to make you dance and sing along. ""Starting All Over"" is cool because it showcases John Oates' voice as well as Daryl Hall, who dominates on stage during their concerts.By the way, their ""Rock and Soul Revue"" with Michael McDonald and the Average White Band is a fantastic show, a must-see. The boys and their band kick some ass on many of your favorite songs, and if you stomp hard enough, they'll return for an encore of ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" and another song."
5,This book is the BEST!,"I read this book in my last school, in 7th Grade! Now u might think that I am too young to give any opinion about this book. Well, whoever think so is wrong! This book is very well inscribed, as I have been searching for this book for over 3 years! I love this book and i never felt about any book the way that i feel obout this book. If you are looking for a book to read that u can cherish all your life, then this is the book you need! Be very greatful those of you who owns it, you might never find a book as prodigious and as marvellous as this. I would STRONGLY reccomend this to everybody!"
3,Good but Inaccurate,"As I amazed my 11 year old son and his friends (and myself) by performing 3 consecutive 360's (I'm 50) they mentioned seeing this trick on 'Dogtown.....' I immediately went down to rent it. I really enjoyed it but I believe they portrayed themselves incorrectly as being the only pioneers of 'empty pool skating'. Me and my friends were doing this on our expensive $10.00 Makaha skateboards in La Habra, California in the mid 60's!!! When we weren't able to do that we were flying down West Road in La Habra Heights with dogs chasing us doing the same hairpin turns as these guys supposedly pioneered 10 years later?"
2,Gimmicky ...no good at all,Quite a shameful gmmicky thing this is. Does not work as advertised and utterly wasted.
3,Misleading size,The picture makes the product seem like it is a lot larger; It seems as though you will get a deodorant sized stick of sunscreen when in fact the product I received was in the shape and size of a dry glue stick. It does what it isintended to do but I expected more of the product and feel mislead by the picture which is not the format or size theysell the sunscreen in.
4,Slightly dry but useable,"This book is slightly esoteric and dry, but for your intro classes covering the MIPS processor, this book is much better than Waldron. Pervin does handle the stack pointer a little differently than most, but everything else follows most conventions. I recommend this book even though Pervin uses the Mipster assembler for a few too many examples while SPIM is much better (and free too)."
3,Works great...or so I thought (updated),"Took a couple of minutes to put up and works great. Nice to have someplace that keeps the broom off the ground.EDIT: Not sure what I might have done wrong in hanging this since it seemed secure, but after a couple of months of hanging and taking down the broom (which doesn't weigh that much) it started coming out of the wall and eventually all together. Maybe I need to try different nails than those that came with it, but what was included did not last. Very dissapointed."
4,Compelling and Heart-felt,"A friend of mine recommended that I read this book. I was hesitant because I didn't have a stance on the death penalty and didn't want to be swayed into an opinion. But after I read this book, I can truthfully say that I am moved to do more for the cause. This book is so compelling and filled with emotion. The author displays compassion and hope in such a dark gloomy place. After reading this book, I realize ""justice is bought; not sought"". Rarely will you find a rich man on death row... much less if he's actually innocent. This book is an EYE OPENER!"
4,Natural Organic Hair and Skin Care: Including A to Z Guide to Natural and Synthetic Chemicals in Cosmetics,"This is a very informative, highly useful book with sound basic facts and information.I have been impressed with the amount of scientific knowledge and factual information in this book and would highly recommend it to any one who would like to get away from the chemical assault from mass produced skin can hair care products.Well done!"
4,A good resource,"I bought this book 4 years ago and I am still referring to it! This book has a wonderful dictionary of cosmetic ingreadents and what they are. It also explains natural ingredients like Jojoba, Avacado oil, and Rose Hip Seed etc. It explains their properties, and how to use them.I wish more books were like this. My only complaints are that the recipes are hard to follow (I use other books for that) and that my book is falling apart at the seams and needs to be replaced."
4,The begining of something BIG.,"It was at the shore of this decade that well known guitarist/producer Phil Manzanera decided to give these four kids from Zaragoza, Spain a shot at the music world. What developed from that coalition was the birth of a legendary Rock & Roll band. With this album (and the follow up -customary- Live version ""Senda 91"") they quickly broke into the European and Latin markets with songs like ""Entre dos tierras"" (""Between two lands""), ""Oracion"" (""Prayer""), ""Decadencia"" (""Decadence"") among other very well written & performed songs including the re-release of ""Heroe de Leyenda"" (""Hero of Legend"") the band's first Hit Single from the premature -and their first- Album ""El Mar no Cesa"" (""The Sea doesn't cease""). It was a very rithmical demostration of inmense potential that would later place them on a pedestal of what many call 'The greatest Rock & Espanol Band ever'. This is a CD you might as well get now, because if not, after listening to their later work; you eventually will."
4,Not just another sad movie.,"While the circumstances of these characters may seem familiar the way they rise back up from them is not. I commend Tyler Perry for taking on such a different project because it is treasured by many but he did a fantastic job bringing this play to the big screen...his best work to date. Watch it, you might be surprised."
5,For colored girls,The best movie I saw and quite sometime. I always love Tyler Perry movies and he is a great screen director and actor. This movie was true to the heart and soul for many that have gone thru certain circumstances such as what was in the film. It is a must see and keeper for when you just want to sit back and watch a good flick.
3,In the middle on this one,"I was very excited to see this movie, but that excitement dwindled away as the movie went along. I was turned off by all the poetry in it. If I was a person that liked poetry I could see enjoying it, but those words were lost on me. It just seemed to go on and on and on...became monotone to my ears. The acting was okay for the most part. Although they all had their moments Thandie Newton, Loretta Devine and Phyllisca Rashad did the best in my book, they made the movie worth watching and so did Whoopie. Not quite sure how closely this movie relates to the book but hopefully the book was more entertaining. I am not trying to stop or get in the way of anyone purchasing this movie but I will warn you not to be surprised if your excitement dwindles down like mine did when I watched it."
4,Excellent Plot//Tiring dialog,"I actually liked this movie a lot at the beginning. It was mysterious...the characters were clearly presented, and the message the producer tried to portray was clear. But I lost it toward the middle of the movie when the characters started to speak poetry instead of regular dialog. After that, it just all went downhill. Every one of the characters that opened their mouth to speak, spoke like they were on a stage (at a talent show) quoting poetry. As a person who is really not into poetry, I found it difficult to follow....it made me feel like I was watching a movie in another language because I had to try to decode what they were saying. I never want to watch another movie like this."
4,for colored girls,"is a movie anyone can see, but i think for black women its harder to digest because for many, this is or was our life at some point. there are plenty of things that happen that many people dont realize, but we dont back down or give up. we are strong. this moive is about 8-9 strong women and their stories. ita amazing to see how you would deal with the issues if you were in their shoes. tyler perry never disappoints and always has you thinking on your toes. a must see."
5,For Colored Girls,I saw this movie at the cinemas and knew after seeing it I would add to my collection. Tyler Perry did a wonderful job of casting such great actress. I know that when you watch the movie you can see yourself in a few of these ladies which made me think. I have and will continue to recommend this movie to all woman and even men
1,"It wasn't broke, don't fix it!","Tyler Perry fails miserably in his attempt to make a movie that translates into the imagery of the beautiful poetry of Ntozake Shange.The feel of pain and suffering in poetry should remain in the imagination of the listener, and not sensensionalized with blood, gore, and violence like it is done in cheap B movies geared toward audiences with the minds of pre-adolescent males.Despite powerful performances by Kimberly Elise, Thandie Newton, Kerry Washington, Anika Noni Rose, and Tessa Thompson to name a few, I can't give this movie more than one star because it doesn't deserve more.Mr. Perry, stick with Madea. We all enjoy her!!"
5,Great Movie,I purchased this DVD for my sister as it is what she told me wanted for her birthday .....and she told me that she loved it.I ordered it and paid the extra to have it delivered within 2 days and it was there so the service was fantastic..... what else can I say?
1,It was dead when it arrived,The plant was dead when arrived :( Wasn't very happy!! .................. Can I get a replacement?? You may contact me!
5,Six stars!,"Thank you, Ms. Hart! What a wonderful book. I have never read a book with this plot line and it was a breath of fresh air. Ms. Hart has a gift for grabbing you and pulling you into the lives of the characters. I felt as if I was in the room, experiencing what they were experiencing. All the raw emotions that I felt were incredible. What a talent this writer has for description. Right down to the tiniest detail. I loved it! Seth and Maggie are unique in the fact that they both overcome such obsticals throughout this novel. The book is fastpaced, has a little intrigue and suspense, and, oh yes, the love scenes. The love scenes were great. This book is going to be big, I can tell. It would make a great mini-series, but for the life of me, I can't think of any stars that could do justice to Seth and Maggie. READ THIS BOOK!"
1,I knew I was in trouble when...,"After reading the wonderful ""House of Cards"", I knew I was in trouble when I picked up ""Dark Side of the Sun"" and there was no 'Acknowledgments' or 'About the Author"" which told how much that Andrew Dymond enjoyed the show, Henson, etc. DeCandido (author of ""House of Cards"") lists all the many sources he used to write his book. I am pretty sure that Dymond is too embarrassed to tell where he found out all his information on Farscape. The characters are all wrong, the settings are allwrong and the interaction between the characters is non-existent. It is painfully obvious that he does not watch the show at all. I can only assume that someone handed him a brief synopsis of the show and the characters and he went from there.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A FARSCAPE FAN!!!Please, Tor Publishing, let DeCandido write the next Farscape novel."
2,Was pretty bad.,"I really liked the first book, but this just couldn't live up to it. The characters personality's were all wrong. Firstly, none of the crew think of Chiana as a helpless little girl. Rygel being out done in haughtyness WAS a good touch, but any true fan can hardly imagine him NICE. The whole thing about Crichton's recorder using CD's and the fact he had music from the 80's is kinda hard to believe. I mean this is supposed to be the future, right? Also, Andrew Dymond could seriously use some lessons on elaborating. Show, not tell. The plot itself wasn't half bad, but the way he developed it needs major re-editig. And you have to wonder if the guy even WATCHES the show. Hopefully ""Ship of Ghosts"" will be much better written."
1,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book but was disappointed. It would have been nice for the author to at least watch the series. I can not recommend the book. I frankly want my time back that it took to read this ""dren""."
3,Only Good because it's Farscape,"I looked past the inconsistancies, as large as they were, because I wanted more Farscape after scifi channel cancelled it. But seriously, this reminds me of that terrible Planescape: Torment book. Did you even watch the show? How was Pilot in Jon's room?! He can't leave! Chiana is not white. She is gray. Pilot is not on the Bridge. And the dialogue was so out of character it wasn't even funny. Jon never had a cd player in his module dagnabit! Watch the show before you write fanfiction...please! Other than that I enjoyed it because it was more Farscape."
3,Not as bad as some would have you believe...,"I don't know why people are saying this book is bad. Sure the book may not have the depth of the last one, and it has some errors, but all in all the story is imaginative and action packed. The characters could've been written better, but they were by no means hollow or off from what they should be. The discriptions of the aliens in this story are almost the best part. Highly original. And if you like Aeryn there are some very well-written moments with her. Bottom line: anyone who really loves Farscape will enjoy this book, despite its few minor shortcomings."
1,Review - Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money purchasing this book! I did, and it wasn't even worth the shipping charges! Amazon has a lot of nerve selling garbage like this! What is this, ""home published?"" I can't see that any self respecting publisher would actually print this tripe! It was nothing more than a ""tribute to the authors own ego"" regarding a subject that he apparently knows nothing about! I was hoping to find some useful information here! I can't believe that Doris Rapp recommends this. Has she even read this book? After reading it myself, I would think not! She must be a relative or something! I'm so Siskel or Ebert, but I can sure give a ""thumbs down"" to this book! Don't waste your money!"
2,"Great for Acoustics, Worthless for Solid Body Guitars",Accurate tuning for the most part. Does not pick up signal well on solid body electrics. Not suitable as a stage tuner.
3,A good action movie with a few flaws!,I recommend this movie for the people who enjoy martial arts movies. It has great actions! I loved the mortal Kombats movies so this movie is very similar so I think you will enjoy it as well.My biggest disappointment was the fact that the main character its small and looks like a teenager!
2,Stinkken,"I rarely write reviews but I had to warn you! I should have went to sleep and saved my $3.99 for a MP3 Album Deal of the Day. This was definitely a 99 cents rental. I liked DOA and was hoping it would be similar to that movie. Unfortunately, it was as bad as Street Fighter. It also makes me think of the Dragonball: Evolution fail. I only gave it 2 stars because at least Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa visually made a good Heihachi Mishima. Lateef Crowder was a good Eddy Gordo. Jon Foo made a decent Jin but he's not even Japanese. The fight scenes were wack. This movie was so low budget, they couldn't afford Donnie Yen to play Marshall Law. If you do watch it, then there is something after the end credits. I hope this is redone right! I leave you with a fitting line from the movie: ""Defeat is a choice, so is victory."" The people behind this movie obvious went with the former."
1,Just bad,"I am a fan of the Tekken games and the DOA and King of Fighters movies so I thought this would be an okay movie, I was wrong. This movie was one of the worst movies I have watched in a long while. I still make fun of it for how much it says Tekken throughout the film, they changed the name of the city and corporation to Tekken City and the Tekken Corporation. I am fairly certain that the did this so you would remember what piece of garbage movie you were watching. One of the two characters I wanted to see in it wasn't in it and the other was just mangled into something completely different than how he is in the games. DOA and King of Fighters were fun and kind of cheese movies this wasn't."
3,Expected it to be worse,"The story is weak, and quiet similar to most of the movies, not original. Characters are okay. I could say it was more or less exciting to watch some of them fight. At the start I would give it 1 star, but then as I continued to watch, in the end I decided that it was okay. If there ever will be Tekken 2, it must be nothing like this movie. I wouldn't call it boring, but it was nothing special. The movie is okay to watch, if there is nothing else to choose from."
3,Too small,The glasses I ordered are not as described. They're listed as holding 8 1/8 ounces but they only hold 6 1/4. Too small for me.
5,yay,I remember Aerosmith from when I was younger my parents were 70's and 80's rockers and that is what I remember growing up. I love this CD pack (two CDs) it has their greatest hits and it is good. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see what Aerosmith is like. For those of you who already love them I'd go with buying their other CDs.
5,Awesome!,"My first Aerosmith CD and am I happy with it. While it does not have all the BIG hits, it has enough to please."
2,There are other collections of them better.....,only 10 cuts from their 70's columbia years and this is a columbia records best of package? Their couldve been lots of other songs from the columbia years but the Geffen tracks are what is the most here. Those have been relased alot more than their columbia tracks. The new songs are hardly hits and are more of the corporate thing to do with a best of. I wouldnt get this If ya have all the albums nor is this a good representation of them but it his just the hits. If that was their main intention then this is for you.
1,remeber when aerosmith had fans?,"it was in the 70's when people actually gave this band respect and worshipped them! now aerosmith has not that much money left(since they are using it to buy protools and hard drives galore)so they milk the fans dumb enough to buy this junk! aerosmith even decided it would be cool to release the album with a total of 5 different album covers which means some memorabilia collectors are going to have a field day with that!""girls of summer"" the song sounds like it was made in mintue!this band are sell outs and has beens!skip this album steven tyler already has enough ice!"
5,Greatest hits ever of an 80s band!!,"Now that Steven Tyler is a judge on American Idol i think to say he s doing a world of good helping those onto their next career of being a singer or in a band either way he s awesome and so is his daughter!! Yet these cds are completely rockin with all the greatest tunes from ""Dude looks like a lady"", ""Rag Doll"" and my personal favorite ""Love in An Elevator"". But i gotta say this album will not disappoint any loyal aerosmith fans out there as long as you purchase it brand new instead of used you ll love it trust me!!"
2,AEROSMITH FOR BABIES????,"This is it...Aerosmith's Oh Yeah Greatest Hits, it's not all that great. It has some really irritating, simple, and boring songs, why do I have to always hear Walk this way or Sweet emotion on the radio???? They get old. Aerosmith are really overrated, plus they've only made like 3 really good songs. The 2 from Get Your Wings, and Janies Got a Gun. Other than that, this is junk.......and Aerosmith are for babies. Get that Joe walsh greatest hits album that had Lifes been good insted."
4,"One CD is Good, The First Disc","This is a good collection of Aerosmith songs. The first disc mayhave the best songs. It's even got Same Old Song and Dance, Seasons of Wither, Sweet Emotion, Dude (Looks Like a Lady), Janie's Got a Gun, and Love in an Elevator which those wouldbe my favorites on this collection. Dream On, the buick commercial song is also on here too. First of all, I'd ratherhave 15 or 16 good songs on 1 CD than buy all those other Aerosmith CDs. This goes great with Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits.Ranked the second best heavy metal cd yet."
5,"Fantastic! A ""Must-Have"" album!","I've been a fan of Aerosmith for about 20 years. This collection is a great way to be introduced to the band, and also a great collection for the hard-core fan."
4,this was great,"I was so happy to see another erotic book for bisexuals. Some of these stories were really hot and others were a bit confusing. I'm not complaining however and was glad to see some stories with male,male,female sex were included."
4,rotary tool accessory,I would have preferred a Dremel rotary tool stand holder but it was discontinued. This one is better than nothing. The plastic clamp does and will break. This one makes my second one to buy because of it breaking.
4,Fit was correct for 1998 Fleetwood Flair 29V,Fit was fine and they do well but my wiper springs may be weak to achieve the best clean. Important issue is the length and cleaning is condition of wiper mechanism.
5,Great product,Just got this in today and i am certainly impressed with the quality of this kit. Everything you need is right in the box. Im looking forward to putting it on my truck this weekend. If you want a good inexpencive lift for your small truck/suv This is what you need!
4,It was like re-living entire phases of my life...,"From the lasting effects of a Catholic upbringing to the trials and tribulations of growing up a gay male with a female best friend, this book hit so many nerves I feel as if I could have added some chapters and have kept perfectly in tune with Clifford and Janice. Both darkly funny and deeply touching, I've read the book six times and each time it rings truer than the previous read.On general principles Mr. Johnson has tapped into the difficulties and contradictions we all face when growing up and trying to sort out our identities and destinies. The characters could be your neighbors or even yourselves or your family members. A solid, wonderful read."
2,Works ... sort of,Works for soft vegetables like zucchini but is worthless for something tougher like carrots or beets. I'm still looking ...
1,"Effective at cutting vegetables -- hands, too","Works well on all kinds of vegetables and it's very sturdily built -- but its extremely sharp blades are dangerous. There is no cover for the teeth for storage, and during cutting there is no protection for the hand that is holding or stabilizing the vegetable.I cut myself badly on both occasions I used it, even though I was being careful. Really badly. The second time, I needed stitches.After that I threw the peeler into the trash without hesitation. Next time I'll go for a julienne slicer or mandoline that has a way to grip to the vegetable that protects the hand. It's too easy for it to get out of control."
3,Solid Live Album,"Kenny G is master saxophonist and this album is just a ok. Too bad. I think some music is not ment for big audiences. JAZZ is personal, sexy, sensual, and soft. A small club is much more ideal for Kenny G. PLEASE sample this cd, before you buy it."
2,"Decent music, bad presentation","C'mon, people -- 73 minutes for 11 sax tunes? Even with KG's velvety sound, that's slow torture after a while. The running times for most of these are wayyyyy above the studio versions, with some of them so drawn out (with long pauses that seem to be exaggerated pleas for more applause from the earth muffin crowd) that one wonders if Kenny was planning on making a second live disc to stuff another 11 diluted tunes on. I mean, 10 1/2 minutes for that VH1 snoozer, ""Songbird""? Give us a break! As an ambiance record, this disc has its place in some homes, but as a jazz presentation it is an utter failure. At least Yanni redeemed himself with his powerful ""Acropolis"" release, while Kenny just reinforced the Sominex label many had already stuck on him."
5,Dog favorite,These pig ears are big and delicious (for dogs). We have 4 dogs and these are their favorite chews.
1,Never received book,"I have never had a problem with amazon.com before. But, this experience has made me ask around for other sites to buy my school books...that are more dependable. I didn't have time to order another book, so I have gone this entire semester without the required book...ugh!!"
2,did not fit description,This product did not fit the description on what the seller put. The seller also never returned my Amazon e-mail. The book had water stains/mold which was not clarified and also had highlighting when stated it didn't.
4,Nice shoe tree...,"Very good fit and spring compresses nicely. Works very well and shoes have nice cedar smell - a plus.Have bought quite a few shoetress, i like this and will order again. Ordered a XXL and it fitted my 14M."
5,The Best Shoe Trees Period,"I have six pairs of these Allen Edmond's shoe trees and I love them! They make all my expensive Mezlan shoes keep their shape and they are also great for travel! Now I don't have to worry much about my shoes being crinkled in my suitcase. I put these babies in and cover my shoes in a shoe/garment bag and they travel great! They also make great gifts!I wear size 8 and the mediums fit great in my shoes! Occasionally, you can get them for $20 with free shipping from the Allen Edmunds web site. Else, the $25 price is great on Amazon with overnight shipping for Amazon Prime members."
1,"Shoddy quality, PERIOD.","This thing ""works"" in the sense that it occasionally does what it supposed to. The buttons never work consistently and were that way straight out of the box. It has progressively gotten worse and the buttons are losing there resistance making the watch even less reliable. I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE."
3,"Items are okay, but time in shipping was terrible","I ordered 10 stopwatches, the estimated delivery date was June 11th to June 19th. We needed the watches by the 24th of June at the latest. After emailing the company three times, someone finally responded to advise they were shipped on June 13th, which was after the expected delivery date!!! They finally arrived June 25th, which was a day late, so we were unable to use and comment on the actual product. If you want something from these guys quick, don't count on getting it quick."
1,THE MASTER HAS LOST HIS TOUCH!,"I love the first 3 Romero dead films but this one is a different story. Honestly, I can't even consider it in the same breath as the other 3. Lack of scares, bad script, bad music(where's Goblin when you need them?) and ridiculous Bush administration comparisons make this a very bad ride indeed. Stick with the remake of DAWN as a modern day zombie vehicle. It's light years better than this."
2,"The world is dying, zombies everywhere. What do you care about? Money of course!","That's right. The motivation for the people in this film is money. Imagine yourself in a world where zombies have killed off most of humanity. People are hunkered down in a walled off city. So what's your biggest concern? Why making money of course!And with that the film proceeds to tell it's tale. The film had a shot at being great. It had a fantastic cast for a Zombie movie, with Dennis Hopper, John L and that guy from the Mentalist. Oh well. It still has lots of zombies craving human flesh and lots of scenes of zombies attacking. So it does have some redeeming value. Just don't expect a great story here folks."
2,Disappointing,"Land of the Dead was not altogether a horrible movie, but it could have been much better. Especially because it was made by George A. Romero. The first three films, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead were all superb. However, Land of the Dead did not live up to its predecessors' greatness. In fact, Land of the Dead was a big disappointment. But it is not so bad that you cannot sit through the whole movie, unlike other reviewers have posted. Although not a great film either, the remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004) was actually better than Land of the Dead in my opinion."
3,Back to slow moving zombies,"I liked the premise but the story could have been better thought out. The effects and make up were absolutely fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for was that we were back to the slow moving zombies. With the recent movies such as Dawn of the Dead, we've gotten spoiled with the fast, more menacing zombies which are way scarier. This could have been a much better movie with a different cast and a darker, scarier screenplay. John Leguizano sucks! He really should stick with comedy (loved him to death on Too Wong Foo) and Dennis Hooper needs to just give it up. All in all just an average zombie movie that could have been so much better."
1,Romero on Zombie Drugs !,"Give me a break... how can anyone like this junk! ""The best film of the year"" ... you have got to be kidding me. The previous viewer was righ... ""a movie for RETARDS !"".... yOU DONT get more cheesy than this, for human kind I hope not!"
4,Surprise Ending!,"something along the lines of ""they're just looking for a place to go, just like everybody else."" (one of the final lines of the movie). Couldn't stop laughing. Good movie, very enjoyable!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though zombie fans might consider it a point of honor to watch this film, everyone else should probably look elsewhere; Land of the Dead is by no means a bad movie, but it lacks the flair that characterized Night/Dawn/Day."
1,Its been done before,"I liked all the other movies in George Romero's ""Dead"" series. My main complaint with the movie is the intelligent gas attendant zombie. Why? Because the notion of the intelligent was done before (and better) in Day of the Dead. Bub (the zombie in Day) has been worked with over time with Dr. Logan, when we are given no explanation for the gas station zombie's intelligence. I liked a lot of the movie other than that, but I cringed whenever he was on screen. It ruined the movie for me."
1,Not good,"This movie is going to suck, just like people who write reviews of movies they haven't seen yet."
3,LAND OF THE DEAD,NO CLASSIC BUT STILL A CUT WAY ABOVE THE AVERAGE HORROR FILM. ALL THE GREAT GEORGE A.ROMERO TOUCHES ARE HERE AND THE FX ARE AS GOOD AS IT GETS.THE ONLY REASON I GIVE THIS FLICK 3 STARS IS THIS IS THE 93 MIN THEATRICAL RELEASE NOT THE 140 MIN VERSION THAT WILL COME OUT ON DVD IN THE FUTURE.
4,Great Film!,"I thought this was an excellent film. Is it the best in the series? Hell, I don't know. Who cares? As is typical in many reviews, people are forgetting that this is a movie and over-analyzing and nitpicking it to death. Just enjoy it for what it is...entertainment.To the previous reviewer: You have way too much time on your hands."
1,Garbage,"This movie is so terrible, I was under the impression that this would be similar to dawn of the dead. Not even 5 seconds after the credits did I know i made a terrible mistake watching this. The zombies in this movie have that Michael Jackson Thriller Video look going on and the whole thing makes me feel like its 1985 or something. The storyline is bad and maaannnn what is up with the ""zombie leader"" thing. Yup this one beat Bubba Hotep for most crappy movie ever."
2,Land of the Dud,"This movie left me shaking my head as far as how bad or boring or stupid it was. No resemblance to any Romero movie from what I could tell. Hey, I know Zombie movies are pretty rare but, c'mon you dont have to make em so stupid. A couple of shocks but not much else."
1,worst movie by far,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres and was totally thrilled to watch this with my friends but this movie is not a movie you want to see.I give this movie a 1 star because of the horrible story plot and the whole ""smart"" zombies. I can't explain how horrible it was. If you know about zombie movies, its best when they are dumb and the whole outnumbering of the humans and the humans have to fight their way out like in Dawn of the dead. If I had to choose between watching this movie(Land of the Dead) or watching Barney with my little cousion, I'd go with my cousin and buy her a whole new collection of Teletubbies AND watch barney with her. Very dissapointing movie."
3,Lackluster ending,"I loved the series but I too felt that the book ran out of gas towards the end. However overall this was a great trilogy, with wonderful characters!! My favorite Silwyth!"
5,Terrific!,"Earthy and good music when you invite sophisticated dinner guests. Here earthy means simple, unadorned, basic, human, sincere, not something else."
2,"Some good, some poor quality","I don't know of any other company that sells such a variety of opaque, colorful tights. I bought a large number of them and didn't discover that some were damaged before the return date had expired. When they are good, they are very, very good and when they are bad... it's a waste.I hope they will step up their quality control."
3,Interesting historical novel about the founding of Carthage,"If you like history novels about real world places, people, and things, you might find this a good read.Small spoiler..... Local ruler of what is now called Libya / Numidia rewards hero with ""as much land as can be contained inside / underneath a cow hide. Hero takes the cow hide and uses a very sharp razor to peel the cow hide into a very very long leather strip........"
5,A different kind of book,"This is a different kind of math book. It is not a textbook. Neither is it a monograph on a special math topic. It is a eclectic collection of proofs largely from number theory, combinatorics, graph theory and discrete mathematics in general. It is inspired by what the famous peripatetic mathematician Paul Erdos would like to see in God's BOOK. In my view, this book is best appreciated by dipping in occasionally when you are in the mood or when you have read a proof in another book and would like to see how it is done in this book. Most of the proofs are accessible to undergraduates or even college students."
1,So-so stories with several errors,"Only the first story in this book held my attention, though the ending was predictable and not very inventive. One story is supposedly set in modern-day Seattle, but Girardi has several glaring errors regarding names of local sports franchises (it's not ""Sea Hawks"" but ""Seahawks"") and local place-names. He should have done more research if he's never lived here."
4,A mix of the brilliant and absurd,"The best way to describe this collection is a mix of brilliant and terrible stories. I really enjoyed three of these moral tales, but the other four ranged from mediocre to bad. The tales that I did not enjoy were plagued by characters that I did not find believeable or plot developments that did not seem to make sense. For example, I did not find the love affair between the mute German and the expedition leader's daughter in The Primordial Face to be believable. Also, the abrupt conclusion to Arcana Mundi left me thinking that the story was more a work in progress. However, the brilliance of my favourite stories (particularly The Demons Tormenting..... and Sunday Evenings...) made suffering through Girardi's lesser works worthwhile."
1,Can I give it no stars?,"This is by far one of the most overly simplistic, poorly written books I have read recently.Anyone with experience in branding will see it for what is is:* ""stating the obvious"" * inaccurate * contradictoryIt should be banned from all libraries at top-tier business schools.Hopefully it won't taint the good previous work of Ries and Trout."
2,An over-extended brand,"Al Ries has written or contributed to some stellar marketing books including ""Focus"" and ""Positioning"". The 11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding is a disgrace compared to previous works.It appears the Reis' got caught up in the Internet hype, stating things like ""putting your name on both your physical store and your Website is a serious error"" and ""On the Internet you should start the brand-building process by forgetting everything you have learned in the past"", WHAT?The authors demonstrated their knowledge of the net by introducing us to FrogDog (FogDog.com) and the infamous JRKoop (DrKoop.com), which makes one wonder if the authors were even awake when they wrote this book.You'll find as much hype and as many ill-conceived marketing laws in this book as any on the market. I'd take this book over something like Charles W. Kadlec's ""Dow 100,000: Fact or Fiction"" so maybe it's worth a second star. The bottom line:DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Amazing!,"This is a no-questions-asked just get it! If you love the guitar and/or flamenco music, you are going to adore this!! Theyre amazing!"
3,"Not that great,","Friends, I am a rocker. John Sykes is a rocker. Why he chose to do a CD of ballads is beyond me. I hate to say disparaging things about the man, but hey, his CDs are expensive. So to sum things up, MAKE SURE YOU BUY 20th Century, Out Of My Tree and his Tygers Of Pan Tang stuff instead. By the way, if you do not have his work with Thin Lizzy-SHAME ON YOU!"
3,Interesting question; less interesting answer,"What would it be like for a present day traveler to live on an Earth that has been ""fast-forwarded"" 127 years into the future? The answer has to be a combination of [1] the psychological impact of interfacing with people living in that future society and [2] the difficulties of living in that more-advanced-technology world.The question intrigued me, and I was interested to see how the author would answer it. But plotwise, to make the hero's transition to that future Earth more difficult, the author had to come up with plot points to make that future society different. But those differences were just not that interesting to me.In addition, the numerous typos were a constant distraction."
1,major distractions in text quality,"I read this book.many years ago, but this particular edition seemed to average three or four typos per page. I assume the ebook was scanned from an original hard copy, without any follow up. I say this because some pairs of letters were consistently mis-interpreted.the text was so hard to parse I finally gave up two-thirds through."
1,Nothing but a waste of money,"I'm really surprised by the previous reviews. I bought this one week a go and do NOTHING to bugs, you actualy have to ""kill"" the bug (mosquito, fly, etc) by TORTURING it, you will find yourself pressing the 2 buttons for as much as 10-20 seconds in order to kill the bug, if you just zap it for a few seconds you will only torture the bug, like giving it an electroshock and leaving it with epilepsy.. A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY."
3,Nice Sheets,"Nice sheets, great price, was slightly disappointed about the sheets not being wrinkle free."
5,Perfect for our first grader,"Very informative encyclopedia, about the right level for ma first grader to read and understand. Just the right amount of information for them to process. This is the second encyclopedia we buy from this collection! We have not used the web link aspect of the book."
3,book was better,"I enjoyed the movie, but only because I had read the book (as well as all the other Michael Connelly works). The movie itself is not especially well acted, along the lines of a ""dirty harry"" quality, so for Eastwood fans it would be worth checking out. I was disappointed though that they changed the book in remaking Buddy's character. In retrospect Eastwood was probably not the right pick for the title roll. I am looking foreward to the day a Harry Bosch novel is made into a film, along with flash backs to Vietnam's tunnel rats...now that would be worth seeing."
1,blood work,"this is the worst detective movie i have ever seen. in twenty minutes i solved the crime that it takes clint eastwood's character the rest of the movie to solve. the motive, the crime, etc., are completely given away by the first clue. yet the movie keeps draging on as clue after redundant clue fail to yeild any progress. it's like watching wheel of fortune and all but one letter has been revealed, yet the contestant can somehow not solve the puzzle. absolutely horrendous, please don't waste your money."
3,Eastwood mystery,"Genre: Mystery, DramaGenre Grade: B+Final Grade: BThis was a great Clint Eastwood film (he directed and starred in it). His acting was superb in it, and the story pulled itself together well. Eastwood is so good with lighting effects in creating visual tension and keeping the audience in suspense. So many directors of our day seem to have forgotten the power of a simple lightbulb. The only part I didn't like about this movie was its predictability because it follows basic genre lines too much. I had the killer figured out ten minutes into the movie, and there was no suprises to keep me on the edge of my seat or awed. I recommend this movie though, because I don't know if most audiences would be able to figure out the killer as quickly as I did, I just could see through the plot and knew what was going to end up happening."
3,Enjoyable Thriller,"Hopefully no one has given away the plot twist in their review. I won't, because I found this movie very enjoyable and would encourage youto check it out.Clint does a very good job with the direction - some of the settings and photography are excellent. The pacing also flows well and keeps your interest. There are one of two plot points that should have been sharpened up a bit, but overall the story is compelling.It's not as good as Clint's best work (UNFORGIVEN, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY), but it is certainly worth the time. Call it a ""beach"" movie (like a ""beach"" book, something you bring with you to kill a few hours)."
1,The truth,"For those of you who have read the book first, Im sorry you had to see this movie.Shall i tell you how it really goes.Terrell McCaleb is approx mid 40's and had a virus which damaged his heart and forced him to retire from the FBI as a serial profiler. HE WAS NOT AN OLD MAN WHO HAD A CORONORY!The book is surperbly written, and was then completely hacked up and filmed. They even put in a different murderer!! What happened to James Noone, the actually murderer..????How dare anyone take a brilliant piece of fiction and destroy the whole story is beyond me.If you like the book - DO NOT WATCH THE FILM."
2,They ruined the book,I just read the book and it was full of suspense and twists and I loved it.The movie...Ugh.Too many unnecessary changes. The story didn't flow at all. And there was no chemistry between the leads. Very hard to believe they'd start a romance. In fact her whole part was rather cool and unemotional for someone who was trying to find out who killed her sister.
2,very disappointing if you have read the book,"Perhaps almost every movie version of a very good book effort has to disappoint and maybe expectations are even higher when Eastwood is involved, since his previous attempts in the director's chair working with some challenging material (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) have gained him quite a bit of respect. Blood work is one of Connely's best thrillers and deserves better than this movie can deliver. Eastwood does not well directing himself as the main man and gets the McCaleb character all wrong. He acts like he jsut came back from the ""Eiger Sanction"" and had both a heart attack and a stroke! There is no chemistry between him and Wanda de Jesus who is definitely the weakest link in this movie. The storyline is flattened and loses so much momentum when compared to the book that even the decent efforts of Jeff Daniels don't help. Skip the movie and read the book instead!"
3,"Three Stars For the Movie, Zero Stars for the ""Artwork""","While no masterpiece, BLOODWORK is still a decent Eastwood thriller deserving of far better treatment than the bargain-basement repackaging job on display here."
3,decent enough thriller,"This is not the most satisfying of Eastwood's films but it is a good enough thriller featuring Jeff Daniels and Anjelica Huston as part of the supporting cast. Eastwood battles time, a heart condition, and a killer on the loose who has been targeting him for years for personal reasons. Okay as a rental to kill an hour and a half."
3,not enough,"This book has a lot of useful information, but a lot of it is general. First of all, this book is supposed to be illustrated - and it is to an extent, small blue line drawings or several icons/symbols, but I expected more. Also I found that a lot of the explanations of symbols were not complete, or fully explained. Not only that, but there is a lot of symbolism left out. Several times, I have gone to look up an item in the book and it wasnt even there, I feel like there wasnt enough research done in the production. (but then again, to have a more complete book of symbols, you would need a VERY LARGE BOOK, and this book is tiny.) Good for quick general referances, but not good detailed information about the different interpretations of symbols."
5,Encouragement for Caregivers,"Through true (and often humorous) stories, ""God's Heart - Your Hands"" brings to life the realities of Christian service in the realm of caring for the disabled. Both professional and 'at-home' caregivers have benefited from the reassurance the book brings - You Are Not Alone. Laurie Zurinsky has a knack of understanding and bringing comfort to the comforter."
3,"Works, but doesn't hold charge (read below)","I bought this battery once I noticed that my OEM battery was loosing charge rather quickly. This battery charges up and works fine, but drains sharply after a short period of usage. I don't know if it is the camera or the battery. Hence my 3-star review. Haven't had time to research and find the culprit."
1,Stupendous! Miraculous!,"This battery works so well that it will cure aids, solve world hunger and bring to pass lasting world peace!Actually, it's just a battery."
1,Please read my review,"This Puerto-rican guy is getting famous, I mean MTV only shows the good songs but when you get the album, you go WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! WHY DID I GET THIS?!! Mario's songs were soooo boring, songs ""Gallery"", ""She Got Me"", and ""Like It Or Not"" were the only songs where this guy sounds like he's giving his best, not that i like it. Also, song ""Fired Up"" was a really perverted song, I hate r&b and hip-hop!! And what kind of song title is ""Cohiba"" anyways? DON'T GET THIS!! You'll regret!! Soooo boring! I nearly fell asleep after listening to the first 10 minutes of this crap!"
4,"A bit wordy in spots, but a great work on American Democracy","I just read Dr. Wests book and it is an amazing insight on the factors that are shaping democracy in America and the world. Its like shining a flashlight in the dark. It shines light on the ways to strengthen our democracy, and further our democracy. West has an ability to recognize ""GroupThink"" and avoid it. The book has lots of historical references along the way, and explains a lot about the societal minefield that we must navigate in order to progress American democracy and democracy abroad. The level of truth shown is amazing, and it clears the smoke screen of media rhetoric, while at the same time providing a historical map leading to our current state of affairs."
2,An off target polemic,"After enjoying Cornwell West on Bill Maher I was encouraged to buy this book. Unfortunately, I found it to be poorly researched -- essentially West has invented many labels to categorize the current state of affairs -- there is little in the way of empirical data to back up his assertions or recommendations.Secondly, everything comes back to race with West. Race may be his shtick but it isn't the most important lens for evaluating the current state of democracy."
2,Disappointing story compared to the series.,"I loved the 26 episode series. It has a great mix of comedy and serious story telling. I own all the DVDs and have had many repeat viewings. This movie is pretty dull. There are a few cool Wolfwood action scenes toward the end but Vash kinda sucks in this story. If you've never seen Trigun before, watch the entire series first, don't start with this movie. If your a huge Trigun fan it's still worth watching at least once."
1,Stale Cookies,My order arrived late and the cookies were not fresh. They were very stale. I regret placing the order and definitely will not order from them again. I don't recommend purchasing these cookies. Find them where you live locally.
4,A heartbreaking story of courage and motherly love,"While I found ""One True Thing"" to be a better developed novel, this other Anna Quindlen book is also very good. The story focuses on a battered woman who leaves her abusive police officer husband and changes her identity in the hopes of escaping his anger and hiding their son from his negative influence. It has a nice rhythm to it and will keep you turning the pages. Don't look for a happy ending, though. Anna Quindlen seems to have an uncanny ability to make you cry."
3,"Good book, a bit too long though","I enjoyed this book, but thought that toward the end, some of the chapters were too much. The one thing that I really liked about this book was that you got a feel for Fran's relationship with Bobby without having to read about it in ""real time."" Her memory reconstructing events was a great way to tell the story of her marriage without starting at the marriage and then taking you to ""now.""However, a real flaw in my opinion was that by the end of the book, the stories of her marriage all started to sound the same. I skipped about 30 pages toward the end, and got to the part when Bobby finds her - and honestly, I don't think that I missed anything important.This book is good - it's not too sad, and not too complex. If the subject matter was a bit lighter, I'd say it's a beach read, but it's not quite that due to the content."
3,I kept waiting......,"I kept waiting for something to really HAPPEN in this book. It was hard to follow and was extremely repetitive which is not good in a book that's under 200 pages long. I feel that the whole book could have been summed up in about 50 pages. I was also not a fan of the way she went backwards in time, recalling what had happened when every single memory was the same as well. Definitely not a book that I'd keep on my shelf. Donating this to the library and was surprised Oprah picked this for her book club. After reading this book, I won't be reading any more from this author."
2,Boring!,The beginning held my attention: an abused housewife starting over with her son. However the mood of the book never went beyond from self pity to hope for the heroine. Read Kiss Mommy Goodbye by Joy Fielding instead. At least the abused housewife had a more fighting instinct in her!
5,Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book. If I'm not hooked by the 3rd or 4th page then I know I probably won't enjoy it. I picked this book up and didn't put it down for hours. What made it great for me is that I was able to really picture what this family was like. I use to live in the New York area and knew many ""cop"" families and one in particular seemed to be close to these characters. I really enjoyed this book."
3,"Old story, no new twists","I have enjoyed Quindlen's short stories and columns for years, but this book lacks the depth that you normally see in her writings. The characters are shallow, and I never quite understood her relationship with the gym teacher, or her feelings for her little girl. The ending was rushed- it seems as if there was a page limit for this book, for Fran's (or Beth's) thoughts are very scattered and not very convincing. This book reads like Stephen King's novel, Rose Madder, only in his book we saw a deeper, much more feeling, heroine."
2,Another Hyped-Up Oprah Loser!,"While the story behind this book may be compelling, the manner in which it was written is not. Too bad the author never took an English grammar class. So annoying to have something this awful on the best seller list merely because a talk show hostess liked it."
4,Sad realism,"This book disturbed me just because of the subject matter, but of course that was anticipated. It's just sad that it could be the true story of a number of women. I can't imagine being as scared as this woman was. It's pretty well written but weak in some spots. It's not a repeat listener, but it's okay once."
1,Black and Blue,"Read it. . . hated it. This book should have been the screenplay for a TV movie. Too predictable, unsatisfying. I can't believe this was given such a high rating by Oprah's Book Club! She must be kidding."
5,Powerful Look at Male Violence Against Women,"Wow. Anna Quindlen did her research. The topic of male violence against women is often mistreated and misunderstood by the mainstream media. This book captures the violence (emotional, psychological, sexual, and physical) that Fran Benedetto is subjected to and finally leaves. Emotionally this is not an easy read. I found myself disturbed by the harrowing accounts of abuse. I can't imagine a better response. People should be disturbed by this social issue and more people should read this book to raise their awareness of what it's like to live with and try to escape such violence."
4,Worth the Journey!,"Extremely well written. Although the story touches upon the unfortunate existence of domestic violence and the often ineffective methods of ""fighting back"", Anna spares us the grizzly details and instead focus' on one women's heroic strength and drive to start anew. Her driving force...preventing the pattern from manifesting itself in the next generation, her beloved son. The ending leaves you feeling both happy and sad...never giving up hope."
3,Blecchhh!,"This book was interesting and realistic, but there was too much oooey gooey stuff about the little boy. Fran was always like, ""I love my son sooo much...oh I must protect him...oh I'm such a great mother cause I love my son..."" Gimme a break! Every other page was about how much this lady loved her son."
2,"Not convincing, too predictable","This book was a disappointment. While it starts out well enough, in the aftermath of an abusive marriage, it never fulfills its promise or even comes close. The ending was predictable, and her new marriage and relationships were not well defined. The last few chapters reminded me of a firecracker that just fizzled oout."
4,Good but abit too Self-pitying,"The characters in the book were so well described and seem so real. However towards the middle part of the book I felt that there was too much self-pitying. I was almost bored of the 'it's all my fault' tone of it. Thank goodness there was Mike Riordan to act as a balancer... although he's at the total end of the spectrum - too good, too optimistic. But overall, it was a pretty good read."
1,Anna Quindlen could have written this story in 50 pages.,"The story seems interesting, but the author goes on, and on. I did not enjoy the extra information at all. Most of the book is fluff that is very repetitive and pointless. Wally Lamb adds background info to his characters, but I cared about them and the info. was relevant to the story. It had about 2 exciting points, the rest put me to sleep."
3,Mediocre,This is the first time I read an Anna Quindlen book. Her story started out pretty good but I had a hard time routing for Fran (the main character) with the choices she made. And the ending left me a bit confused. It was almost as if the author had to hurry up and finish the book. All in all it was a half way decent read but it could have been a little less predictable.
2,Didn't really like the book very much.,"I read this book because of the Oprah Book Club recommendation. After seeing the show and hearing their recommendations and comments regarding the book, I thought sure I would enjoy this book. However, after reading the book, I found this not the be the case.I thought the basic story was very good. I was horrified most of the time and I am sure this was the plan. I found the book to be repetative and slow going. I ended up skipping some parts and skimming others.The point was made and I would probably recommend this book to anyone in an abusive situation. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book to anyone I know."
3,Black and blue,I enjoyed this book very much. It was very well written and kept up my interest throughout. The characters were very believable. A very sad story from start to finish but well worth the effort. One of Oprah's better picks in my opinion.
1,This is not the Americana artist and producer,For anyone that might be confused by this artist using the same name as an existing artist this is NOT the Americana artist and producer Ed Pettersen.
4,Chocolate Watchband - 'At The Love-In Live' (Roir),"A lot of you probably don't even remember the CWB.They were a west coast five piece that existed between 1965-68,releasing three worthy lp's.Apparently,the band had reunited on November 6,1999 for a show at the Westbeth Theater in New York City.From what I could tell,there appears to be three original members-vocalist David Aguilar,bassist Bill Flores and drummer Gary Andrijasevich.Best described as charismatic garage rock;sort of like a Stones wanna be.Most happening tracks were ""Don't Need Your Loving"",""Are You Gonna Be There?"",the Dylan cover ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"",their anthem ""I'm Not Like Everyone Else"",""Misty Lane"",""Sweet Young Thing""(my personal favorite Chocolate Watchband tune)and ""I'm Moving On"".Not sure if this was a one-off gig reunion or not,but I don't think it was.Will appeal to fans of the Standells,Kingsmen,Strawberry Alarm Clock,Music Machine and the Flamin' Groovies.Recommended."
4,A pledge to destroy witchfinding,"Detailed historical novel from the satirist James Morrow on the witchtrials of the 17th century. Jennet Stearne is the daughter of the witchfinder royal in England, her father a sanctimonious witch pricker decides that his own sister in-law is a threat and puts her on trial. After murdering Jennet's aunt, England dispatches their witchfinder to the American colonies where the Stearne's find themselves in the middle of the Salem trials.Jennet pledges to destroy the witchfinding creed using Aristotlean elements combined with Newton reasoning. She spends her life in various situations living with Indians, shipwrecked on a new Atlantis, spending time with Newton and Ben Franklin, and living as a faux witch herself. Another great novel from James Morrow, I would also recommend Towing Jehovah"
2,Not James Morrow's best work.,"I have just one thing to say about the story:If our protagonists were stupid enough to use themselves as bait, especially by actually contriving evidence of witchcraft, and also stupid enough not to see that anyone who is hunting for witches is not the type of person who would be swayed by scientific evidence than she deserves whatever fate she receives for being so stupid. I know that without it occurring we wouldn't have a story, but it's hard to care about characters who are too dumb to live.PS. Also Benjamin Franklin's portrayal was irritating in the extreme."
2,Oh Well,"I had great hopes for this book but by the 100th page, I had lost interest and found myself quickly skimming through the rest in search of some paragraph that would pique my interest. Morrow, sad to say, appears to have spent 7 years on this book."
3,Old but Good!,"I actually came across this track online. Was looking for Umboza's song ""Sunshine"" and found ""Cry India"" - decided to give it a try. Turns out it remixes African Chants from Lionel Richie's ""All Night Long"" (only the chanting though, not Lionel's vocals!) into an upbeat dance track. I only know this one version, and there aren't any real vocals other than the chanting. But I think it is pretty phat and, with some additional remixing, could be even better"
3,Good Starter,"This stethoscope is good as a ""starter"" for people just getting into health care (e.g. nursing students, etc.). There were a few downsides: It's a little heavy around the neck (as someone had mentioned earlier). It is difficult to hear heart and lung sounds in in people who are overweight or women with lots of breast tissue and it can get tight on the ears.For the price and quality, it's decent. I was able to successfully use it throughout nursing school. I could sometimes hear adventitious heart and lung sounds with it (when it wasn't even noted by the nurse or documented in the patient's chart) and sometimes not, but that came with practice. I recommend it for temporary use, but would buy a stethoscope of better quality when officially practicing in the field."
3,PLS detector and grade rod don't work together well,"This is a nice laser as described in the previous reviews, but I wanted to note an minor engineering defect: The SLD Detector mount that is usually used with this does not fit on the bottom section (largest) of the PLS grade rod (without prying off the rubber feet, which makes it slide easier on the aluminum rod, which is undesireable). Poor design.... the SLD Detector mount should fit the grade rod (both made by PLS). When I contacted PLS, they basically said there is no fix and have a nice day. Annoying."
1,Trash,Once again the right wing has gotten someone to do their dirty work for them. This book is all pure lies and trash. ALot of this has even been talked about before and researched before-and it is all LIES.
1,TRASH TRASH TRASH,"Trash,absolute trash. Can't you men stand the fact that Hillary Clinton is a very intelligent,,gracious lady with political savoy equal to any of you? I am appalled that Edward Klein would lower himself to write such crap.You sir must be hard up for money,you certainly are no gentleman."
3,Didn't do much for me,I thought the book was dull and not very imformative. This is old news about Hillary and I am still shocked that this is on Amazons best sellers list. I would veer away and spend your money on something good like Whispers of the wicked saints.
3,"This book will not be out until June 21, 2005","Both of the previous reviews are irrelevant, especially the second one. I gave the book 3 stars because I have not read it yet and felt I should give it the benefit of the doubt until I do so. I am only posting to let others know the baloney of the other 2 reviews.By the way if you are going to source an organization as proof that a book is full of lies you might want to find a source with an unbiased opinion. Not an ultra left wing(progressive) organization such as Media Matters for America."
4,It is scary alright!! But entertainning too.,"I got this book because I am not a big fan of Hilary, and my Fiance is a big Fan of Hilary.From what the author protrait of Hilary Clinton, it didn't make me dislike her more or less, but it gives a little more reasoning why she behaved the way she did. I guess you can call that clarification. There are a few parts that I actually find quite amusing, as someone described our former President as a Golden Retriver that behaved badly.However, after showing only a few lines of the book to my Fiance, he said he is not as fond of Hilary anymore. I don't think the book is a defamation, I think it is more of a gossip. I don't think the book is of any harm to Senator, even though I will not be voting for her in 06' or '08. Even before the book, I don't think Senator is fit for Presidency in this country."
4,Keep Hillary OUT of the White House - Once was enough!,"Very interesting read - but not surprising. She has always come across as a very controling, egotistical, want to be! This book just delivers the information. Keep her out of the White House!"
4,Klein did his homework,"""The Truth About Hillary"" is a sequel to Dick Morris' book, ""Rewriting History."" Different authors with parallel facts and observances. I appreciated the extensive bibliography and footnotes. Klein did his homework. Don't read this book before bed if you are prone to nightmares.Meredith CrellinMedford, OR"
3,I feel unclean...,"I am half way through this book and I am unsure if I will finish it. I am no fan of the Clintons, but I sure feel dirty when I am reading this book. I am sure most of the stories are either 100% true or have elements of truth, but I can't help feeling like I am listening to a bunch of gossipy mean-spirited Clinton haters who can't give either of them credit for even one good thing they did.I think they are both very intelligent capable people. It is disappointing when powerful people who get such world-wide exposure are so slimy. And they are not alone, many people in power do despicable things to get where they are and many times they get away with it. Are the people who claim to be the Clinton's friends really truly their friends?I am sure glad I got this book from a used book store's clearance section."
1,Utter Crap,"If you think this is factual, you're either a right wing nut or an idiot. Come to think of it, that's the same thing. This book is so poorly researched it's fiction. Totally designed to cater to the prejudices of the ignorant."
1,Klein???,"At one time Klein was a real journalist/writer doing credible work, but this, this is re-hashed stuff from other books (mostly already discredited) and his new stuff is pure speculation. Are we suppose to believe Clinton is a lesbian because she knows lesbians? or went to a school that some lesbians go to? The stupid neocons aren't even trying anymore to dig up dirt on Clinton. Someone must have driven a dumptruck load of money to Klein's driveway to get him to do this piece of shabby research and gossip. I expect this tripe from Kitty Kelly, but I never would have thought Klein would take the money and run. But alas, he's a sellout too. Klein offers up proof that there is no credibilty left in his pen, just another hack writer looking to score on a silly made up story book for haters of Clinton, who'll believe anything, if it's bad, about the woman. So go ahead Hillary haters, spend your money on this fiction and become absolute suckers. The joke's STILL on you. You just don't get it yet."
1,Too bad for you chumps,"This book is terrible. Too bad but it looks like this is gonna be your next president idiots. That's what you get for supporting a complete (...).I'll vote for Mccain before Hillary but the bottom line is that it's gonna be greedy, chickenhawk, (...) GOP OUT! and somebody much better that actually cares about other people on this earth in. You neocons make me sick. Chumps!!"
4,Can the country really afford more clinton years?,"This book provides more examples of the poor character, honesty, dignity and dishonor that Hillary displayed during her years as fist lady. Her radical background and support of numerous liberal causes will be shunted into the shadows during her presidential campagign, as she tries to appear to be what she isn't. The terrorism threat will only increase in the years to come, and once elected, appeasement will not keep our children safe.Klein gives examples of how ruthless she is and how willing she is to destroy any opponent. A good read to remind readers of the scandal ridden years the Clinton's were in power, and how far we've fallen as a nation beginning with her husband's election."
1,The Best Fictional Account on Hillary Ever!!!!!!!,"This book has been widely discredited by serious journalists everywhere. It is riddled with errors. If you get your news from Murdoch-owned news outlets, this is the book for you."
1,incredible lies!,"This book doesn't even pretend to be factual. If you hate Hillary, you would save a few bucks by making up your own reasons. Be as outrageous as you like and you will be more accurate this this piece of crap."
1,truth is lies,"did you know if you know a lesbian you are a lesbian? this and other really great points that are made by the author!?!? red meat for neocons?--no,they already know everything in this book.an understanding of hillary for her faithful?--no,the author doesn't even spell the names of major players correct.nothing to see here--please move along!"
5,Great Book,"Hilary Clinton is going to play an important role during the Apocalypse. I really don't believe that she is THE ACTUAL anti-Christ (it is presumably a male), but she is going to be a lead force driving the evil that's to come during that time. She will be in a VERY close bitter race (probably the most vicious presidential race in history) in 2008, but will not win. But, AFTER the rapture she will have strong political power.Anyway... I liked this book."
1,"The Bad, The Worse and the Downright Ugly","I have read many different things about the Clintons - both positive and negative. Klein's work should be highly scrutinized. Not only because of the fact that he asserts his self-appointed credentials in psychoanalyzing Hillary, but because some of what he has written is questionable, at best. His ""numerous sources"" are dubious. Further, the ""source"" information he so relies on to bash Hillary's reputation, motivation and qualifications is really just a lot of perception; the observations of other people, which may be right or wrong, depending on who you ask. Finally, the book was a tad dry - I found it a hard read because it was boring."
1,"""Heavily dumped on by conservatives . . .",". . . and understandably."" So said Peggy Noonan, once a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, in the 6/23/05 Wall Street Journal. She says that it's ""poorly written, poorly thought, poorly sourced and full of the kind of loaded language that is appropriate to a polemic but not an investigative work."" Liberals and conservatives, pseudo- and otherwise, should read her piece. (Note: the use of the Noonan quotes is covered under the fair-use provision of the copyright law.)What remains bewildering is what the ultra-right thought it could gain from this book. Perhaps just that if they threw enough mud some of it would stick."
1,A DISPLACED WRITER,"Klein's preoccupation in the book with lesbianism might stem from his own well known experiences, with a first wife who left him for another woman, a fact that both embarrassed and humiliated him. Clearly, it left a mark that he has not been able to get past over the years. And thus, in a form of possible displacement, he is beating Hillary with an accusation, when it is probably his former wife he feels the most anger toward. The book is shoddy, vicious, and such a obvious ploy for cash, Klein should be ashamed, and the journalism community and writers who do not traffick in this form of porn should condemn him, no matter what their political leanings."
4,broiota,"What I like most about this book is how Mr. Klein captures the irrational, pathological sense of entitlement that Hillary Clinton has. This is a woman whose resume is full of nothing but fluff, yet the rich and powerful democratic elite flock to be by her side, and pay handsomely for the privilege. Further, and what is probably one of the most fascinating aspects of her personality (in my opinion), is her belief that she is absolutely entitled to the attention, adoration, and unlimited funds that she receives.It is my fervent hope that Hillary Clinton is unsuccessful in her bid to hoodwink the American public into allowing her another four years in the White House. This would be a disaster for our country, and Mr. Klein's book tells us why."
3,Lots of facts- Lots of fill,"Up front, I am a Clinton hater. No need to get into details. With this book, I found that I knew most of the documented facts inside already. The author attempted to place all these facts chronologically into a time line. So far- so good ...interesting read. Somewhere he turned into a mind reader and started explaining things he couldn't possibly know. In a certain ""matter of fact"" way, he turned his opinions into fact. He doesn't really try to hide what he does. It's like he thinks that's what I want to hear. So the book is really aimed at entertainment and not shining light on any newly available facts. The Clintons are criminals and it's easy enough to make a case without this fluff. Dick Morris is more able to pull off this type of ""inside the mind of the beast"" reporting because of his close experience with the Clintons. This author needs to objectify more."
5,Read it!,Sure it's dirt -- but he didn't have to dig far to find it. Why are so many democrat party leaders such creepy freaky people? Surely we can do better.
1,Such perverts,I don't get these people who are so interested in the Clinton's sex lives. What business is it of anybody? This book is trash.
5,Read this book before you vote!,"This book does not contain a lot of new information, but it does reinforce what we've heard before and what we need to know about the person who is determined to be our first female President. Now is the time to look at Hillary closely to see what she stands for, what she will do to get what she wants, and if she is capable of being honest with the American people. We need to understand that we must vote for the person that has OUR interests in mind, not someone with political ambitions come ""hell or high water."" It is a frightening story."
1,Not worth the sales tax.,"I guess between the media, the political leaders and now authors are sunk to a new low. I am not a fan of Hillary but i truly believe if you can't say something nice about some, don't say anything. This book is full of personal attacts and judgements to which the new america public love. If you love reading about people being politically raped than this is the book for you. If you have ANY moral fiber of what America use to be then don't bother to read it.But you ask,,,,why did i read it? My answer is i read parts of it in the book store because of all the publisity and from what i had heard other non-trash throwing people. Ed Klein should be ashamed of himself but then again what kind of person is Ed. He is degenerative himself and the only way he knows how to write is to tear people apart. He should look in his own closet before judging others."
1,Writer has terrible reputation,"Let me steer clear of the obvious politics related to any book about Hillary. The fact is that Edward Klein may be a bestselling author, but he's achieved that by sensationalizing his subjects and doing little, if any, new research. He cobbles together secondhand stuff from other sources and is known as someone who does not do research. He'll pass on rumors and lies. Read this for entertainment, if you like, but understand that this writer is NOT a historian. He's not looking for truth. He cranks out books that are the book equivalent of tabloid newspapers. Take it all with a grain of salt. This guy's a sleaze."
1,Disappointed,"I bought the Kindle version of this for the iPad so as to avoid lugging a heavy book as well as the iPad around. I was disappointed at the content. Very skimpy, and not easy to navigate around. The information in the book wasn't even that interesting. I ended up buying a book on Florida (from the same publisher) instead and taking that with as the book just had so much more. I am a fan of the DK Top 10 series, but always get the paper version - this just does not match the paper version. Waste of money."
3,"Moves quickly, fun read but not Woolrich's best","lazza is right - this one is probably best left for Woolrich completists. I've read in other places that Woolrich was best at atmosphere, and not with logic as to plotting. This is surely true of Black Curtain. There are some really big holes left unanswered when you finish it, but nonetheless, it's a satisfying conclusion. It's a b-movie read - read it on a flight sometime, it's very short."
3,Not as good as her other work.,"I found it extremely difficult to suspend disbelief in the matter of Dom, who was first introduced in Dodd's last book. It seemed as though his personality changed too swiftly in some aspects to be remotely believable and the chemistry between the two leads was not as strong as others of Dodd's books. A pleasant story but not one of her best."
3,DISAPPOINTED AGAIN!,"I can only repeat the review I gave ""The Runaway Princess""....If this is the first Christina Dodd book you have read please don't give up. I have read so many of her books and this is not up to her standards. Please read ""Candle in the Window"" or ""Move Heaven and Earth"" and especially my favorite ""A Well Favored Gentleman"" before you judge her writing."
1,'Someday My Prince' was royalty at its worst!!!,"I found many faults with this book, beginning with the first of my observations. It lacked any romance!!! Yes, the book contained some intrique and danger but lacked the romance, the wit, the strong confident hero and the headstrong willful heroine. Neither the hero or heroine were particularly likeable characters and the plot and the 'secret' were unbelievable. I may have found enjoyment reading about the hero if he had been raised in the West, particularly North America, for his language usage was that of an American and not of a European. But I found him a slimy worm of a hero and found no reason why she, the princess, should open her arms to him in the end."
1,CHRISTINA DODD TELL THE TRUTH! WHO WROTE THIS BOOK?,"Dump a Christina Dodd book after 75 pages? Who wrote this sappy, stupid book? And what scared literary agent is killing herself writing these unbelievable reviews? Don't bother reading this one. It will be a very long time before I purchase another Dodd book. (I've read every other book she's published) This writing is too simple and immature for Christina. Sorry, Christina. :( PS How in the world does this average 4 stars? Check it out. Do the math!"
3,disapointment,i was disappointed.....my 15in. laptop would not fit and zip up. the quality of the product was good but was advertised to fit up to 17in. laptop and wouldn't even accomidate a 15incher. i'll be giving mine away when i find someone who can use it.
1,Disappointing Album,"Kudos to M. B. Richardson's assessment of this classic rip off, complete with non-original recordings, PLUS his opinions of the Australians responsible for this sham! And pftttttt to Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""'s review which ""forgets""to mention ""the problem"". At least somebody's honest out there."
1,Not original and not the Roger we know!,Not the original recordings.... but don't just blame the Aussies here... part of the blame goes to Roger for re-recording them!
4,Excellent road atlas but...,"I purchased this for our driving tour of Britain in 2005. It was the latest edition at the time. I found it a delight to use or rather my wife navigating found it a delight to use, that is until we had to navigate around some very small towns south of the Lakes District. It was there we found that the fine details were not accurate, we'd found similar trouble in Cornwall but thought it was inexperience in the country.An excellent road atlas on many levels, ideal size but we were let down on the details, perhaps the latest editions are better."
2,This book no longer relevant,"I just took the test yesterday and this book was basically the only one I used to prepare. It went over information you really don't need and didn't cover well enough the ones you do. There was a level of detail that was not addressed in this book as well areas that weren't even covered. A co-worker of mine used two books, this one and the All-in-One and he said that the All-in-One covered the areas and was more accurate to the test. One more point the questions in this book are nothing like the ones on the test and are not a good judge of what the questions will be like."
2,Vicks should publish this under the NyQuil brand,"The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition is a very comprehensive, technical guide that will help you pass the CISSP. It is also horrible to read. If you need a reference guide to build on a few weak areas covered by this exam then you might find this book a valuable reference. I am very familiar with Telecom and networking, but need to read up on most other section. For this, I have been turning to a book purchased by a co-worker: CISSP Cert Exam Guide by Shon Harris. I don't know if the Harris book has the same information coverage as the Gold Edition, but it is far easier to read. Take this advice: Read a few sections of each book. These are too expensive to take the chance - I took the chance and regret it..."
4,"This could change your point of view, too!","This story talks of a young boy's (Andy)life. He goes from having unusual tendencies to be able to see through other people's eyes, being able to tell his family specific facts about these people in the photos. Andy then begins to have dreams that he is an Iraqi soldier named Latiff. He acts out the life this soldier is living, and even speaks his language. Westall not only shows readers about the Gulf War through the Iraqi's eyes, but also shows readers how people from other countries viewed americans. He really is able to make you understand what people went through."
4,A book that stretches the imagination and holds the interest,"As copy editor of Gulf when it was published by Scholastic, I was intrigued by the far-fetched but oddly believable story of an English boy whose consciousness becomes entangled with that of a desperate Gulf War soldier. The book uses the conceit familiar in so many children's books--that adults dub a child's experience ""fantasy"" when he is telling the truth--and pulls it into the real world with a troubling impact. I became a serious fan of Westall through this book, progressing to Blitzcat and then every other book of his I could obtain; he was a wonderful author, too little known in the United States."
1,Wrong Product - Did not send correct product,"Warehouse- supply advertises that they have the Niger flag when in fact they do not. When I ordered the flag, it was confirmed, then I was sent the Nigerian flag. It took over a week to get in touch with someone at the company because they did not respond to emails, they have strange business hours, and their phone mailbox is full. When I did get in touch with the company, they corrected my order and told me the new flag would arrive in a few days. Well, a few days later, I received an email from Amazon giving me a refund for the product. I did get my money back, but the company is REALLY hard to get in touch with. Also, they still currently advertise that the product is in stock when it is not. DO NOT ORDER!!"
2,***Buyer Beware***,"This printer,scanner, fax, and copier has compatibility issues with Windows 7. I had to go to Cannon website to find drivers. It matters if you have 32-bit or 64 bit as well. Hooking this product up and using it was a nightmare.***********Not even a year later, I am back on Amazon looking to purchase another copier,scanner, and fax machine. It is crunch time and the expensive toner is leaking everywhere. In addition, it is jammed and does this often when it gets hot. Again...run for the hills and save your money!!!!"
3,old model.,"This printer old model and I had problem to setup , I was ready to return but my friend was help me to setup, so am used it now. I wish size of this printer should be smaller."
1,"Damaged item, NOT GOOD",It looks like I spent the money for useless thing. It is giving me more tension to operate. you may get that I am a very regular costumer of Amazon.
4,Printer,"I love this laser printer. It is fast and quiet and has great print quality. We go for periods of days to weeks of not using the printer; the ink jet printer would always clog, much ink was wasted head cleaning. Now after hours, days, or weeks the printer works perfectly.I wish I had maybe got a fancier model so that I could do 2 sided printing but it isn't a big deal."
1,Driver does not install on 64-bit Windows 7,"Drivers on CD-ROM won't install, message saying that drivers are not for 64-bit system.The drivers on the Canon website won't even start downloading, message saying the source is invalid.I call the 2 toll free support numbers and I get a recording saying that this call is not valid for me area.At least it works with my other computer.No more Canon printers for me!!!"
4,A decent all-in-one,"The Canon ImageClass MF3240 is a decent all-in-one monochrome laser printer for home or even for home office. Actually I only need a copier, scanner as well as a printer, I did not set it up for its fax function. I am happy with the overall performance of this printer so far. The only bad thing is the price of the printer dropped after I have made my purchase."
2,Waste of money.,"I decided to buy this printer because it was a laser with a scanner. It might have been my worst technology purchase ever. First, the printer does not work with Macs, meaning my wife can't use her computer with it. Second, it doesn't work out of the box with Windows 7, which means you'll have to search the internet for drivers. Third, it jams constantly -- and the jams are not easy to fix. Fourth, it's ugly. Really ugly. Do not buy this machine. I'm giving up on it after only 6 months of ""use""."
3,good value scanner and printer - UPDATE 11/12 for problems,"I don't know if the MF3240 is a workhorse because our family only uses it for light scanning and copying. As a basic scanner/copier, the MF3240 is terrific. Easy to use, with fine printing quality, and a great value at the $75.99 Amazon price in late November 2008.UPDATE November 2012 - For months the printer refused to print because it wanted me to insert the right paper. It seemed to think I was using European standard-sized paper. I hadn't made any changes from plain vanilla US 8.5"" x 11"". Now it refuses to print more than once before it needs to be reset. Specifically, I have to unplug it and then replug it to reset it. It still copies and scans, but I don't think 4 years is an acceptable useful life before seeing errors like this. So I am downgrading from 5 stars to 3 stars."
3,Misleading name...,"Not so much an actual dictionary of the superstitions as a dictionary of quotes. Each entry traces the evolution of a superstition, but the quotes are sometimes untranslated and vague. More for English majors than those curious about superstitions."
4,"an electric eclectic mix of old and new, will make you shake","a wonderful blend of various beats makes this compilation a must-have for those who want music that no one else has...although some tunes tend to stretch, overall this cd has the ingredients to make any groove session complete...highly recommended"
1,A total disappointment,We bought this because my daughter absolutely loved her Laurie Berkner DVD. We only made it throught 10 minutes of Jamarama. The sound quality is terrible and my 3 year old kept asking when the video was going to start because the camera work doesn't bring the viewer into the event at all. This is a waste of money. I actually can't understand how anyone thought children would enjoy this.
1,Jamarama STINKS!!!!,I would have given this no stars but they made me pick at least one. I can't believe I paid $15.00 for this DVD. I bought this because my daughter loves Laurie Berkner. The quality is just horrible. And Laurie only plays two songs. Are you kidding me? The Ohmies are as annoying as can be with that high-pitched girl squealing between acts!!!! How did they get the majority of time on stage?
2,Didn't like this one.,"Dakota writes a story about a rapper in a magazine, the rapper doesn't like it, gets revenge on him and then vice versa. While I liked the author's first book, Dark, I didn't like this one at all, I didn't like the main character Dakota."
2,A'ight...,"I remember when Jay-Z said he liked R. Kelly cause he was one of the few R&B singers who could talk about women & love without being corny. The whole time I read the love scenes in this book, I shook my head. They were corny! But Mr. Jasper had a very interesting and unique topic to write about. His writing skill is still impressive, but ""Dark"" was 100% better than this book. The main character was lame, kept fighting between tough guy vs. corny guy, and there were too many Cinderella and Superman scenes. But I'd still buy his next book cause ""Dark"" showed me that the man has skill."
1,don't like,"my husband got me this set for christmas, if he hadn't bought it for me i would have never gotten it for my self. i opened the box and was shocked, not with joy but with a feeling words just can't discribe. i love my birth stone but hated what it looked like in this set. they are to big and weight way to much for ears. i do not like them at all, but of course i'm not telling my husband that, i told him they were interesting and big. i was hoping he would return them, but he didn't. he actually likes them. If someone is thinking of buying as a gift, think twice because most people i showed this set to HATED IT."
4,Great symphonic metal.,"If, like me, you are a fan of Nightwish, Tristania and Therion, this album is definitely for you!The arrangements successfully combine classical instruments (real ones!)with modern guitars and drums. Some pieces are light and dreamy and then explode with quite powerful guitar riffs. The grunts are not as pronounced as Tristania (for example) and the female background vocals add a nice finishing touch. This album style contains elements from Tristania, ToT but also from Rondo Veneziano and Lacrimosa (although with a lot more punch...). Although I really love this album (except track 2,what is it doing there?), I gave it only 4 stars because it is way too short (37 1/2 min) for such a steep price. You start to really enjoy the music and the CD is already over..."
5,"Loved it then, love it now","Like many who've written here, I first read Constance many years ago, about age 11. I loved the book & have held onto it for the past 30 years (I also agree that the current cover is horrible & the original Dell cover, picturing a pretty young Pilgrim woman writing by candlelight is far, far better). I pulled it out recently, trying to entice my 10 year old daughter to read it. No luck so far, but I will keep on (subtly) trying and hope that she will love it as much as I did, and still do, someday soon."
4,nice,I bought this as a Christmas gift and the girl like it with the bracelet being so small and delicate.
2,It did everything that it said it could until the cable stopped working properly,"Yes. The wrapping cable works great.Yes. The scroll wheel and middle button are easy to use.Yes. The left and right buttons work fine.Yes. The size is perfect for toting around.NO. It is not as durable as one might think.The cable right at the base of the usb connector has some sort of short in it. The mouse goes in and out if this area is agitated by movement. Now, with that said, wrapping the mouse up will probably make things worse which shouldn't be since wrapping and unwrapping the mouse should be the most flawless operation. However, Logitech seems to have made the mouse cable too weak to seriously be used over and over again. If you never plan to wrap and unwrap the mouse over and over like a regular on the go notebook user then this is a fine mouse, albeit one with a short cable. If you plan on going around the world with it, no. It's terrible. Logitech has better mice that are wireless to boot."
2,The cable is too short...,Everyhing is good except the cable but that makes it too bad. It's really too short especially if you use your right-hand and the usb ports are on the left of the laptop or vice versa.I really cannot recommend it to anybody who uses different sides (like left side usb ports and right-handed!).
2,Shoe,This shoe would really only work with a VERY formal situation...I recieved them and they looked just like a shoe that you would wear with a rented tux!
2,Naked Goodkind,"Unfortunately Terry Goodkind has become tedious and repetitive. A story line that once was new and refreshing is now becoming old and needs to be put to rest. Borrowing from the style of Dean Kuntz the passion for suspense is overbearing and stifling at times. It feels as if the story is being drawn out and the ""good coming from behind"" is once again played out. If you get this book feel free to skim it. You will get about the same as if you read the whole thing."
2,Bland,"I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.I feel like the characters have lost their voices. The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books. Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books. I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone. I tried to start the next book, and it was worse. Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series."
2,Its my moral obligation,"Well, I really did learn something from this book. I used to be a dyed-in-the-wool pacifist but now I have seen the light and I am thinking for myself. Here is what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that authors who hook their audiences into a series with a few excellent books and then proceed to write a bunch of self-indulgent trash are wasting my hard earned time and money. These authors are evil people! And from this book I've learned that it is my moral obligation to murder all evil people :) So watch your backs Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, I hope you don't sleep too well because you know I'm coming after you with a bloody axe or perhaps just a sharpened stake..."
5,Terry Goodkind Legend of the Seeker series books,"The book as usual is awesome, I am really impressed with the book store I received the book from. They were prompt and the book was in excellent condition when I received it. I will try to order from them again (did receive another book and got the same service on that one also)."
4,"For me, better than the last one.",I enjoyed this better than the previous book in the series (The Pillars of Creation). I know a lot of people say the books have become too preachy but I did not find that to be an issue. I enjoyed the fact that many of the principal characters played key roles and got into (and out of) sticky situations.
2,"Mostly Talk, Little Action","Terry's latest book is a little bout of dysentery in the Sword of Truth series. He spews out a 50 page rant in the mid part of the book about thinking for yourself and other noble ideas, then he goes on to repeat that same rant again in another twenty pages. What a huge waste of my time!! And in the end we're no closer to the demise of Jagang and Imperial Order. For all the preachy talk I found this book had the least amount of action in the series. I'm reluctant to give this book two stars because I've come to expect more from Terry Goodkind."
1,spare me the lectures,"Entirely too many pages of this book are spent with speeches and lectures on morality. The story is a good one, when they finally get around to it. Two thirds of the book is Richard talking to people about how they should value life and on and on about right and wrong. I was annoyed with it in Faith of the Fallen and I am not impressed with it now. I sincerely hope that there will again be a focus on the story and the characters, not these cardboard cutouts that keep coming into the story to be lectured on the black and white of life as Richard sees it."
3,The last 300 pages were good,"Unfortunatly like many authors who write long prolonged series they must backtrack for some reason. My personal opinion is that they are reminding themselves of their own story by ""reminding us"" of what happened in previous books. Now that said. I actually like the book well enough once i got past the first 350 pages. Yet it seems as though Mr. Goodkind has turned into a philosopher."
2,Downhill,"This series seems to be following the pattern of the Wheel of Time. It started off fantasticly, with storyline and charcters that grab and hold you. But as the books go on.....and on..... it just starts to get worse and worse."
1,"Trapped in ""Robert Jordan Syndrome""??????","Poor Terry Goodkind, the publishing company wants lots of pages from him but he hasn't quite figured out what comes next in the story. Well, just put Richard in danger, take lots of pages to get him out, explain how killing actually supports the value of life and use about 4 of those pages to move the bigger story a baby step along. Oh, and since it is the eighth book, be sure to mention the Wizards Eighth Rule, just in case someone is nostalgic for a worthy book.It all sounds a lot like what Robert Jordan has been going through the last few books. Save your money. Hopefully both authors will get past the celebrity and get back to telling us the real story. I still have hope but it's fading."
2,Least Favorate Book of the series,"Goodkind has build up a lot of goodwill with me resulting from his good writing in past books in this series. However, there are limits. This book is far too preachy, the plot is unlikely even in a fantasy world, and his main charactre Richard, is not very likeable in this book. It was bad enough that I am not even going to bother to spell check this review."
1,Horrible,"I am very disapointed in Mr. Goodkind. I find his constant preaching of his own quite conservative republican ideals to be annoying and out of place. I was very pleased by the first four books of the series. Fast-paced romantic exciting, if a little uninspired definately four star books. Since then Mr. Goodkind's writing has gone down hill, to hit rock bottem in book eight Pillars of Creation. It can, will and has gotten worse in this book. Mr. Goodkind unless i read some glowing reviews about your next book you've lost a customer. The preaching in this book is worse than ever. Charecters seem flat an dull. If your looking for an exciting fantasy read i'd recommend Robin Hobb or George RR Martin. If you'd like to see our war with Iraq justified eighteen times while reading a (rather stupid pointless) fantasy novel stick with Goodkind."
3,"A side story, a footnote, and an annoying goat",Ok Terry we got the picture the goat is SPEICALOk one side storry was good but another is old please get back to the War that is the fun part that everyone wants to hear about not a goat.But it is worth reading so you can read the next one called Chainefire- this book will not have one story from begining to end like the others. it will be one in three books that end the series. it is kind of like a trilogy inside of a series.This book was my least favorite but i still think you should read because his books do have good messagesbut were not here for messages Terry were here for ACTION I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD REMIND YOU OF THATok book though
3,Perhaps a change?,"I gave this book 3 stars mostly based on the beginning of the series, which I found engrossing, and not these later volumes. This book is far too openly ""preachy"" when the previous ones have at least pretened to gloss it over (thinly).Thanks to Mr. Jordan, I've begun to pick up these books from my local library rather than buying them unless I find them worthy of being bought.This series doesn't currently seem to be going anywhere that significantly advances the overall plot, but I do intend to keep following it.If you've read up until now, then you should read this just to keep up, but don't expect much."
1,Enough of the political and moralizing.,"Enough of the moralizing, there was only about 100 pages of story here. Same as the last book. The first four books in this series were outstanding, but downhill after that. I want to see big armies, wizards, action, Richard winning some battles, this is going nowhere. To sum it up, we have 100s of pages of downtrodden and sick Richard with all the political stuff, and then about 20 pages of what you expected at the end of the book.This is the last one of this series I will buy."
2,Just my .02,"After having read the book I came to the conclusion that this particular series is already one book too many for my interest.Mr. Goodkind is a writer and a good one, but the progress and substance of the series at this point in time no longer provide the appeal that I found within the first few books.I do however recommend buying at least the first four volumes of the ""Sword of Truth"" series since they introduce a fantastic, original and creative setting full of rich characters and problems."
4,Naked Empire good and the bad,"This book in not one of his best but is still a good book there are a few part where it lags in the middle of the book but the good news is that he stoped switching between Characters so often in this book, making les frustating to read trough those dull molments, over all i say it was a prity good book, it left me begging for the next one wich thay have not announced yet."
4,The pewee bird,"Not sure what everyone's beef is... I rather enjoyed the book.The pewee bird call, Chase and Rachel, Zedd's daughter's childhood toy... Goodkind is still in there. The wonderful story is still in there."
4,A good book,"Okay, I understand why some people do not like this book, yes the conversations between the charactures are predictable, and a little unbelievable, BUT, I really liked this book! It is what I want in a paper back, fantasy book, a GOOD STORY. I liked that Richard was again featured in this book, I like him. And what is so wrong with the goat? I dont understand what the rest of these reviewers have against her, do none of them have pets? Anyway, I think that it was at least as good as the first book, and far better than a few of the ones in between!"
3,It' s okay,"The book did not seem, to me, as good as the first 7. There was an exceptional amount of non-action chapters. It did get much better towards the end, I'd say about 3/4 of the way through the book. Still glad I read it. On to book 9 now."
2,now he goes after the hippies with the communists,"I like the series as a whole but the quality of the books has been falling off as he does the same theing over and over again. Unlike almost every other reader of the series, I loved The Pillars of Creation. It was a breath of fresh air in a series that is stagnating. The aspect of the books that I can't tolerate anymore is the constant preaching. There wasn't much of that in the early books, but it happens every couple of pages now. Could Goodkind be more of an obvious card carrying Republican? From the anit-socialism, to the anti-peace movement, he continues to spout political ideaologies. My favorite by far is the whole ""don't take away my magic"" thing. This reminds me a little too much of the NRA. ""Don't take away my magic, I needs it to protect my family. I don't want the evil gov'ment messin' wit my rights."" If the next book isn't less preachy, I don't think I'll bother to read it."
4,Amazing!,"I didn't understand all of the negative reviews on this book. People tend to like an author who writes the same feel throughout a series (why have that kind of monotone?). Terry Goodkind brings originality to each book. Just like pillars of creation! Richard and Kahlan were hardly in the book at all....SO?! That doesn't mean the book was written horribly or the plot was no good!! It was original, it gave you a feel of the enemies side!This book was awesome as well. Considering the book wasn't his ""best"" I give it four stars and only because it wasn't his best. The book was great, original, and it was another chapter that helped further the overall plot (unlike Jordan's pathetic attempt to stretch out his wheel of time stories). I trully believe Goodkind has yet to lose his touch. This book proves that theory. Goodkind is still hitting it strong. Maybe in the past couple of books Goodkind might have jogged a little bit, but no doubt he is beginning to pick up speed and make the final run!!!"
1,Another disappointing political rant!,"Having loved the first 4 books in the series I had high hopes that Goodkind might have learned to refrain from pushing his political/social views and focus on giving his loyal readers a great story and great writing. Unfortunately not. This time it isn't ""greed is good"" but that ""might is right"". Although I might disagree with his extreme and simplistic preaching on these topics , that isn't the real problem. The fact is he lets it get in the way of telling the story and developing the characters. You also can't help but wonder if Goodkind isn't a serious misogynist - the female characters are timid or stupid or as an alternative evil.It's a shame to see a story and series that left me eagerly awaiting the next installment - reduced to something I almost dread to read. Shame on you Mr Goodkind."
4,More to do with compliance than with PKI,"The author seems to have ""bought"" into Public Key Infrastructure completely. Many chapters have a simliar formula:1. Explain background on the compliance issue or standard2. Then explain why PKI is so great and solves a majority of the problems with the particular issue being discussed.This leaves a bit to be desired in some cases as the compliance-heavy discussions really move past PKI and into extremely detailed market compliance issues. This book will be useful for individuals looking for information having to do with Financial, e-Government, and Health Care compliance issues but not necessarily with PKI implementations for Enterprise organizations."
1,Read this before buying a LaCie drive!,"I had trouble with my LaCie 7200 Drive/Hub. The drive started to fail intermittently giving disk errors, but it took me quite a while to discover it was the ""switching power adapter"" rated at 12V/5V at 57 watts. LaCie uses these for several larger size external drives. LaCie was not cooperative to help me since I was a few months out of warranty. In looking into this, I was surprised to find a useful page at MacinTouch.com which had literally hundreds of negative comments regarding this type of power adapter failing, dating back to June of 2005. If interested, read the comments at this website and judge for yourself - before buying your next LaCie product:http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/harddrives/topic2190.htmlLaCie might have rightfully issued a ""product recall"" for these overheating adapters (round plug with 4 prongs), but they have elected to ignore hundreds of complaints, while continuing to sell the adapter."
2,Avoid these drives like the plague,"I have two LaCie Mini hubs -- a 320G and a 500G. Both were to be used with my 1.66GHz Mini as part of a home theater setup. That is, until I turned the drives on. Suddenly the computer room was louder than it had ever been. Even my MacPro is quieter than this! The drives run quite hot as well, to the point where you don't want to touch them. Other external enclosures, while not as spiffy looking as the MiniHub, keep my drives much cooler and are far quieter. As another reviewer said, it's almost like the fans malfunction and stay on all the time.Now I have to explain to the wife and kids that they'll need to turn the volume up on the TV to compensate for the sound."
4,TRACK LISTING:,"3 TRACKS -1. Hold Me In Your Arms (Extended) 7:372. Rick's Hit Mix 5:49 ( Incl.: Never Gonna Give You Up, Whenever You Need Somebocy, Together Forever, My Arms Keep Missing You, She Wants To Dance With Me and Take Me To Your Heart)3.Hold Me In Your Arms (7"") 4:24."
1,not what I need!,"I have a new round (counter-size) convection oven -- no book came with it -- this sounded like just what I needed -- but nooo! The receipes are NOT plain, meat & potato ones -- but fancy, touting hard-to-find-in-small-town ingredients -- and she mainly talks about square, toaster-oven like sizes!Waste of my time & money! I would suggest, unless you are a international chef of some sort, don't buy this book!!!"
2,Certainly not for Beginners,"Certainly there are quite a lot of information in this book. But to say it's for beginners is misleading. The book lack organization. Many technical jargon is just put out without explanation. Sentences that need explanation are not explained. If you wanna start from scratch this is not the book for you, you may need to look for another book. However the book may be good as a reference for solving specific problems as done in the later chapters. But frankly I couldn't get any good understanding of TV inners from the first chapters. Also the figures are horrible. Name of ICs in the diagrams do not match the text description. And many diagrams for vital components are just black and white photographs that doesn't show you anything but confuse you.Again, not recommended for a beginner or as a sole reference."
5,Must read,"Must read. I have read all of the series. It was wonderful. In the 11 years I have been married I have never seen my husband pick up a book. He is now almost done with the series. It makes you ""blood thirsty"" for more. Keep them coming."
3,A fun afternoon/evening read,"This book, the 1st in the series, introduces Anita Blake a young woman who raises zombies for a living and, on the side, executes vampires. If that wasn't enough, she meets a French vampire, Jean-Claude and starts to fall for him. The series goes downhill from there.At first, the series is humorous, horrific, but tongue-in-cheek. THe action is good and Anita is a tough cookie. But as the series progresses, the plot focuses more on the relationships between the various characters and less on alternative realities. The action becomes more gruesome and less humorous while the sex scenes are more graphic. I think the writer lost her way and was given bad advice or maybe she was just letting her fantasies get the best of her.I stopped reading them after the 5th book. It just got boring."
5,Anita Blake is the BOMB!!!,"This book really, really drew me in. I just love Anita Blake! She is the absolute best! The way that L.K.Hamilton writes is so cool. I love the characters. I've read ALL of her books and am eargerly waiting the next."
3,Needed more substance,"Not the best book I've read this year, not the worst. It seemed to me that with the (SPOILER AHEAD) ease in which Anita dispatched Nickalaos, it is illogical that she was so frightened of her in the first place. It also seemed like the author planned the book to be a series, and therefore several sub-plots were introduced that went nowhere in this installment. I'm all for aiming at a continuing storyline, but a book should stand alone on it's own merits, rather that counting on the future to provide answers. This one didn't quite make it."
1,Awful!,"It's a shame we can't rate on less than a star.Maybe I'm just not a vampire story fan, but this book was awful and I can't even bring myself to finish it. I loved the Twilight series, and even Buffy was ok. This is not even bordering on ok. I would rather sit down and read bad romance novels than this garbage.The dialogue is lame and forced. The angry bad a** b***h thing Anita has going on is so annoying I'm hoping she gets killed off. Even the mythical creatures are cheesy. Vampires being afraid of crosses = lame. Yes, these things are part of typical legend, but the more recent books have broken out of typical legend to produce some really great stuff.I'm sure this book was ok when it was written in 1993, but in comparison to some of the Anne Rice books (which I don't care for personally but are well-written), the Buffy TV series, and the Twilight series, I really hate this book. It's like reading bad Buffy fan fiction."
2,"Good Ideas, Poor Execution","This may be someone else's cup of tea but it's not really mine. The world Hamilton has imagined is really quite interesting, very little time is spent explaining it in this first instalment but I did manage to grab on through the characters. What I couldn't get past was the writing style; there are so many sentences that are four words or less as well as many short paragraphs that feel like nothing was actually communicated to the reader. My eyes started to glaze over while attempting to get through such sections. I also felt nothing through the characters, not fear or squeamishness with the major villain, no anticipation or excitement with each new dangerous situation Anita jumped head first into and sadly, no subtle intensity with Jean-Claude and his connection to Anita.The world itself piqued my interest and I will give the next instalment a shot but if the writing doesn't improve then it will be a shame that I wasted my time and money."
4,Satisfying and Gory,"I rarely read books my female authors. The subject matter is usually too ""sweet"" for my tastes. Laurell Hamilton is not your typical female novelist. Anita Blake is a strong female hero who is not afraid to admit when she is fearful, and confident enough to tackle the toughest of situations. The character development is complete, and the storyline is believable. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a strong constitution, and a desire of realistic details."
1,GAG,"Such pitiful writing. This was just a sad attempt at story-telling. Overly sexual, but in a cliche and unbelievable way so it just comes off cheesy. I feel like I wasted way too much of my time attempting to get through this novel. I think I'll leave it at that, because honestly, I really don't want to spend any of my time writing about it either."
3,Stubborn main character,"This series is ok. The problem I keep having with it is the main character. She is very stubborn, very rude, and doesn't do anything you want her to do. She just doesn't budge, always questions everything. Strong female leads in books are good, but this one is just to much. She gets worse as the series goes on too. I am at book 9 now and she really annoys me in this book. I think I am done with this series, there is only so much of her I can take. It was picking up and got better, but her motives and her ways really gets annoying. It would be better if she would just give in sometimes and quit questioning things and quit thinking everyone is beneath her. If you don't have nothing to read, try this series, but its not the best, it mostly gave me a headache. Also the language in this book is really bad, the characters cuss a lot, and as the series progresses it gets worse."
2,"a little misleading, title-wise","Hamilton says she wanted to get away from the ubiquitous ""sexy-vampire"" story. So then why does her book have the very sexy title ""Guilty Pleasures"" rather than, say, ""The Vampire Executioner?"" There's some minor sexy scenes in the book, but the main character is all business. My other gripe is that there is some lazy writing and/or editing going on, wherein the same phrases will be used more than once in the same book. The wry joke ""I would bet my life on it...and maybe I was,"" is used in two different situations, and it's not the only example."
4,Buffy with bite,"Unwillingly coerced by the master vampire Jean-Claude, Anita must seek out the loathesome individual who is killing vampires in the city, a task which stretches the reader's imagination as well as the wits of our heroine. Let's face it, this is not the stuff a Booker Prize is made of, but one does not live on creme brulee all the time, nor struggle over Proust. Still, with summer coming, there is nothing I could think better than to sit by the pool with a gin and tonic and an Anita Blake novel. Graphic but not excessively so, sensual but not pornographic, I wouldn't have angina if I found one of my adolescents reading it. Read it in an afternoon while you get a tan."
4,Great series!!,"This is what I love about my kindle. I get the change to read great series like Anita Blake. Can't believe that this book was published in 2004 and I only start reading it now. On the plus side - I don't have to wait for the next book because all the books are available!!I love Anita Blake's character. Although she raises zombies for a living as her night job and being the executioner of vampires as a day job, she is still human with human emotions and feelings. She's even got the common sense of being scared of vampires. In Anita Blake's world it is legal for vampires to exist in society. I love the humor in this book, the detail that every scene is being described so that you don't miss a thing!! And I mean ghouls and were rats, come one it can't get better than this!!! There is enough action, romance, horror, and suspense in this book for everyone. And what is a vampire book without a 1000 year old master vampire and a gorgeous vampire by the name of Jean-Claude."
2,Lacks depth,"The other reviewers who gave this book 2 stars or less have already summed up the weaknesses of this book nicely. The storyline definitely had potential but lacked that depth that makes for riveting reading. I finished the book but only just (wanted to see ""who dun it!).On the whole, I did not find the undead legions in this book very scary or evil (when compared, for example, with the exquisitely horrific vampires in Brian Lumley's books). I won't be reading any more novels in this series."
4,Intriguing,"I've read the first 5 books in this series, and I have to admit that I'm hooked. When I first picked up this book it was out of curiosity while looking for something new to read. Anita Blake is funny and witty, and says things I wish I had the guts to say to people's faces. The characters are all well written and you feel like you've stepped into their lives for a few hours. I'm not saying the book is without flaws, but it's a good quick read."
1,I'd like to see RAW reality-tunnel hs way back from death.,"Robert Anton Wilson predicted repeatedly since the 1970's, including in this book, that we would have seen the conquest of aging and death by now. The reality check he experienced in January 2007 suggests that people should deeply discount his value as a visionary ""futurist"" from now on."
3,Where are the Jonathan-Songs?????,"A good retrospective. Neil has been around for quite a long time, and his older songs still sound amazing. But where is the chronology in this collection? And which puzzles me even more: Where are his songs from the 'Jonathan Livingstone Seagull'-Soundtrack? No Neil Diamond collection is complete without 'Be', 'Dear Father' and 'Lonely Looking Sky'.After all, there are too many songs of his Schmalz-days."
4,Neil Diamond; The Ultimate Collection,This is it boys and girls... If you want Niel Diamond and you don't like the live versions of some songs...then this is the album for you. 40 of his greatest hits including the old version of holy Holy. I really enjoyed this collection. There are a couple that I didn't care for like You lost that lovin feeling with Dolly. And there are a couple songs that I wish would have been included like Headed for the future. But you can't have your cake and eat it too. Right? But for an all inclusive album this is the way to go. It was worth the wait and the price... You won't find this album in your local music store here in the states. So order it from Amazon.com like I did. You won't be disappointed.
3,A stellar effort...,"...if not a stellar result.The plot is rather imaginative. I did find that the characters were a little too chummy to be happening only a few episodes after ""Premiere""--Aeryn, in particular, was getting along too well. It would probably have been better served to be, say, shortly before ""A Human Reaction"".Also, I found the usage of new tech to be somewhat iffy. The power gems I didn't have a problem with, except the name, but ""the furze"" and the DRD army of Rygel's were simply pointless.Overall, worthy of the name Farscape, but it could be improved."
3,I felt a bit cheated,"I had waited so long for this flick to be released on DVD.I couldn't believe the scene with the Beatles music had been edited!!! How could this happen!? It's a crime that Michael Jackson had to mess this up. Despite these dopes screwing with a cool movie,we still get to watch this missing Harry Palmer installment. I wonder why the Ipcress File and Funeral in Berlin are out of print. Could it be that they will be released in a box set after we just bought Billion Dollar Brain.They'll probably throw in the recent inferior Palmer films to make us feel like we're getting a big bonus.Anyway,getting to see Michael Caine as Harry Palmer again is stii a great treat."
2,Computers are big and evil....,"...and other ideas from the 60's.Superb environment and music. For example, the typical furniture. It is also great to see Helsinki in a movie.Michael Caine is a very good actor, as usual, but the movie is not exciting as ""Funeral in Berlin"" or ""The Odessa file""."
3,"The most disappointing of the Harry Palmer, so called, spy movies.","This is a classic cold war era Harry Palmer, now a retired spy, movie with Michael Caine. It does not deal with the cold war as such and is a James Bond style story about a Texas megalomaniac who wants to take over the world. The computer, after which the movie is named, plays only a small part in the proceedings. The movie is a strange blend of the remnants of Harry's cold war foes and a rather silly series of contrived situations with the followers of the Texan which culminate in everything being blown up. All very predictable.It is probably the weakest of the Harry Palmer movies but is still a classic worthy of watching. The Ipcress File and Funeral in Berlin are much better films but seem not to be available in DVD format in anybody's current catalogue. This particular version has not had much work done to restore the original quality and the sounds appears to be in mono."
4,No wait.,Ordered this book for my daughter's Ipad. It came right away which was great as we were leaving for vacation soon after.
2,The most depressing book I have ever read,"Maybe it's supposed to be depressing but it just haunted me with how horrible it was. This book just disturbed me in ways no other book I have read has. I looked at the author's other books and it appears that is just her genre, abandoned children, dark and bleak novels. All with rave reviews. Maybe disturbing just isn't my thing."
5,Possibilities Highlighted in this Wonderful Bible!,"Dr. Robert Schuller brings his love for God and passion for hope to this volume produced by Thomas Nelson publishers. The interesting features include highlighted verses (in orange), either for positive-thinking verses or possibility thinking verses. This bible also has pages that include historical information that relates to Schuller's self-esteem theology that has become a staple of his ministry. This is not an intense study Bible in the sense of having a constant running commentary. But it is a highly readable (NKJV) text with an emphasis on the reader doing the neccessary evaluations. Basically, the Bible is allowed to comment on itself. If you want a bible to inspire and enlighten you, this one is fairly unique. If you're offended by possibility theology than you may want to steer clear of this. However, you may just want to own another bible in addition to this one."
3,Broken things,"I'm only half way through this book but am especially enjoying the unusual story line. Well written, so that the reader can feel the main characters and their thinking. Nice twists that slide into the story. Good to enjoy a book away from the typical current mainstream setting of Middle Eastern life."
4,I absolutely love this product. Nivea Body Skin ...,I absolutely love this product. Nivea Body Skin Firming Lotion has a great scent and is so rich and creamy. No problem with dry skin when I use it. I use it on my face and arms -- and can already feel the difference.
4,I liked Nivea Skin Firming Lotion. I didn't ...,"I liked Nivea Skin Firming Lotion. I didn't really notice any firming in the short Test Drive period, but it's a good moisturizer. It isn't greasy like some moisturizers and it has a pleasant scent. If you like other Nivea products, I think you'd like this. I'd recommend it to friends and family."
2,It's just not ok.,"A mental problem Annie? This album had only one good ""hit"" on it and that was ""Sweet Dreams are Made of This"". I think whoever put together this album had a really bad ear for ""hits"". This has to be the worst Eurythmics album I've come across yet. Who knows? Maybe they'll release another horrible album. It is up to their retarted manager. Personally, I liked them better in the 80's when they were still writing songs. This is a common problem with bands who release new albums ten years after their last album. They put all the horrible unreleased songs on there. Phew! This album is sick."
1,I do not recommend this CD,"I bought the Ritmo Caliente Cd from this band and it was horrible. This Cd is just as bad as the other one. It seems like now a days any amateur can make a CD and sell it on the internet.In my opinion, it sounds like some one made these Cd's in their home studio in their beat up garage. If you want a quality flamenco album try Ottmar Leibert or good old Gypsy Kings. Your 17 dollars will be better spent somewhere else.I definitly do not recommend this CD."
2,Barely blasting,"2 1/2The innovative pair haven't dated as well as good art should, instead sounding more like standard issue techno by now, stretched slightly further from well produced synth-driven melody."
3,"Orbital, as in round and round on the same old trak","The DJ must've been lacking filler on the CD to include the rather monotonous first 3 traks. Sure you get into the vibe as you clik through the traks, but musically, it takes Orbital a long time to morph into progressive takes in the songs. It's like a pounding headache- you can hear the thumps, but can't figure out if it's your head or the track.Take an aspirin and get some other CD, maybe even a compilation which seems the best route for the genre. At least there are more hits and good traks in a comp and if you find you like certain people, then go after them specifically.Orbital 2 is one of those disks you should play while in the car with the windows rolled up. People think you are listening to something def from the beat, but you'll know different"
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE ORBITAL ALBUM,"This has always been my favorite Orbital cd. From beginning to end the whole cd is just a continuous journey to another dimension and am glad i ordered it because i lost my old one. It came in quick, there was no wait and there werent any scratches i easily transfered the cd to my itunes and store my cd for safe keeping"
4,It comes together on the second album for Orbital,"Songs sound better structured than before and have a much more lasting affect on the listener.'Lush 3-1' is one of the best songs on the album, but for the real highlight listen to 'Halcyon'. This is one of my favourite Orbital tracks. Starting off with a solo sample of Kirsty Hawkshaw, the song builds into one of those memorable songs you will be humming for days.A great album."
5,Dreams and Trips and Memories Interloop,"This album obviously stands on its own for its layered complexity, wry logic games and toothy playfulness.But children, there's more. If you listen to it as often as I did (and do) it embeds itself in your consciousness. It slips relentlessly between memory and emotion... now I find myself irresistibly moved every time I play it. When I'm not careful it makes me burst into laughter and tears, then slide into deep meditative breaths... by some deeper volition than I can bring to earth."
2,"Nice watch, but not accurate","Firstly it gains about 2 seconds a day which is quite a lot, and not really acceptable for watch costing this much money. I cannot return it because I had it brought to me from US by a friend.Secondly the dial is much darker then the picture published.Thirdly it is bit heavier then my certina was (which got stolen during mugging) I will get used to it eventuallyLastly, in away it is a nice watch to look at."
5,Seemless Purchase - Great Product!,"I purchased this watch as a replacement for an older Seiko Kinetic that recently stopped working. I am very pleased with the quality and look of this timepiece - it can be worn for business or casual, it has a look that is suitable for just about any environment."
4,Working Girls,"The best thing about Yvonne Tasker's newest book, ""Working Girls"" is the clarity with which she discusses her subject. Too many film theorists get bogged down in discussing ""theory for theory's sake,"" but Tasker illustrates each of her theoretical points-- for instance, the idea of ""transvestism of class""-- with concrete examples from a number of films (in this case 'Working Girl' and 'Up Close and Personal'). This makes her larger and more abstract points more accessible to people who are interested in the cultural phenomenon of film, but who are ""self-taught."" Every time I pick up one of Tasker's books (she also wrote a fascinating study of gender and the action film called ""Spectacular Bodies"") I come away from it feeling educated and a little more confident in my ability to understand film and the ways in which it moves me. I look forward to her next endeavor."
1,God and Mammon,"Praise Jesus and pass the stock portfolios! Since Rick Warren and Joel Osteen have cornered the quasi-religious self-help market, Christian imprints need a new angle to get the folks back home to drop more money in the name of God. Enter C. William Pollard, here to tell us that, when Jesus instructed his disciples to give up all they owned and follow him, he was just kidding! Simply meditate on Pollard's hackneyed platitudes, then sit back and let the Holy Spirit wash away the moral ambiguity of runaway CEO salaries. If there's anything more frightening than the merger of corporatism and the state, it would be the merger of corporatism, the state, and fundamentalist Christianity."
2,Not the same quality as Xerox,We have problems with this toner smudging on pages with more color than just a few words. We don't have the problem with the Xerox toner.
4,Fine Childrens' Book,"I bought this for my four-year-old son, and he loves Richard Scarry's large, detailed illustrations. He loves discovering new details and enjoys the stories as well. This description, of course, applied to all of Richard Scarry's childrens books. What make this one special is Lowly Worm, a character that only appears in other books, get's his own book dedicated to his adventures.Some of the stories are a bit dated, but that is a minor point. It might take some time to explain the ""ancient"" technology shown from the era the book was created, but that could serve as a conversation point with a child (""That's right, when I was growing up there were no wireless phones!"")I remember some of these books from my childhood, so it is gratifying to see my son enjoy these classic works as well."
3,30 minutes of Ecks vs Sever,I will give this movie based on its actors which I really wanted more from this rating. It starts great as Ecks vs Sever. By the time we are half way through they are almost teamed. This movies plot suffered from this. Do away with the wife sceanrio and they could have played the VS thing all the way through. Lisa is awesome and ballistic and I would have givin it higher just on her alone. But her character suffers not enough to make Ecks suffer. This ending leaves open her next movie just as Sever!!
1,Quality vs. Crapola,"Okay, I can hardly believe that there are people here who are actually hyping up this stinker of a movie. I can only assume those people are Lucy Liu fans in denial that she made such a bomb, or hardcore action junkies who think anything with big guns is kewl. This couldn't have been worse if it was titled Battlefield Ballistic. The plot is all over the place. Lucy Liu's assasin seeking some sort of redemption idea is played out yet unfulfilled, and Antonio Banderas has never looked older or lamer in his attempt to remain young(stick to Spy Kids, Zorro)."
3,My amusement vs. my conscience.,"BALLISTIC had some serious actions scenes, yet they don't propel a movie along. The fact that the leads were minorities intrigued me, but they seemed to be a bit on the ""cardboard"" personality side. The movie had subversive danger mixed with secretive pasts, but the leads talked so low and mysterious-like, I had to go back in certain parts and cut the volume up just to hear the dialogue between them. Gregg Henry was very good as the powerful villian Richard Gant, and it was his appearence that gave the movie the conflict it needed. Overall, I enjoyed the movie enough to give it four stars, but it dropped to three because, in all good conscience, action without complexity can make a very stilted movie. With all that this movie displayed, both Banderas and Liu deserved a little better than they got."
1,I had low expectations and they weren't met-not even close,"The plot was so unbelievable, the dialogue so terrible, yet I was willing to overlook all this in case there was breathtaking action or even an iota of suspense. Not even close. For an action movie the action scenes are absolutetly terrible... bad angles, poor choreography. Nothing even barely interesting happens...All I wanted was a dumbed-down action flick... it couldn't even pass as that. Check out any Jet Li movie, Ronin, Speed, read the phonebook (better than Ballistic-believe me!)And if I could give this less than one star I would"
1,rent but not buy,"obviously the guys who marketed the movie never watched it. It is about two secret agents who hate each other and want to kill each other. Or it is supposed to be problem is they never met each other, so the movie tends to be confusion. Lucy Lu and Antonio Banderas make one hell of a team but can't save the movie from itself."
2,UTTER KAOS,"Japanese director Kaos must have gotten his name from movies like this mindless action driven film. With a plot like a disjointed Rubik's cube, the movie is merely an excuse for lots of gunfire, explosions and improbable confrontations. Can one really believe that Lucy Liu could really take out an entire SWAT like team without mussing her hair? And while the stunts are jawdropping, they are so unrealistic that suspending belief is a prerequisite for any type of enjoyment of this film. Antonio Banderas is not only miscast, but he looks tired and bored; Liu looks good and stalwart but her character is merely a martial arts tool; Gregg Henry reprises his bad guy roles from dozens of earlier movies; and martial arts expert Ray Park comes across like a brother to Gary Daniels. While the movie is lively enough, it's nothing we haven't seen done before and better."
1,Zero Stars!,Oh my god this was just pathetic. It was funny as all heck but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. This movie was terrible. Lucy Lu is not a good action figure. She was stiff and slow. She wasn't good in Charlie's Angels so it proves that Lu's friend Banderas helped her land this role.This movie was retarded and dumb. Banderas' acting ( or should I say STRUGGLING with words ) was numbing and he was wasted. His character ( as dumb as it was ) slowly diminished into a pod without a brain. Lu hogged up the screen with another one of her wooden performances. All she does is stare blank eyed at the camera. The special effects were old-fashioned. T2 did things like this in 91!Ballistic is just another big movie full of noise and bad acting. For their sakes Lu and Banderas better pray for a hit movie because Ballistic has sealed their careers' fate.
2,spy vs. spy,"this movie is not to good. The spy vs spy turns midway through as they teaam up to destroy a greater evil and rescue a child. Lucy Lu doesnt have much to say in this film and lets her martial arts do the talking while she comes across stiff as a board. Antonio is a reformed drunk who gets into shape and teams up with her to blow up everything in sight almost. The wierd thing is the explosions just knock the bad guys down not kill them. Later Sever and Ecks can fill them with hundres of bullets.Antonio mumbles alot and looks around as he falls through the movie in a trance. I really dont know what else to say, both actors tried I guess...everyone proably still made alot of money too. its really a darn shame..."
1,sooo awful,"Whomever rated this movie anything over 1 star is either a kid, or just an idiot. I mean rarely is the day that I'll go online to pan a movie, but after sitting through that last night... Look it's a basically a BAD late-night showtime/cinemax film, with two credible stars (I went to see it for Lucy as well). I watch a lot of garbage/crap, all the time in fact, that was just so bad. I'm really not going to go into it, since its already been said, but it's the most cliche filled, awful, completely non-sensible, confusing movie I think I have ever seen in at the theatres."
3,"OK, but not great","I have read other anthologies that are juicier and more exciting. These stories are fine, but some of them miss their mark and seem more like therapy than erotica. There is a lot of buildup to set the stage, but out of a 6 page story, 4 1/2 pages might be build up, which to me is not the proportion I am looking for. There is a nice mix of butch and femme perspective, and of couples vs. one nighters. I might say more of a good introduction book, and then you can focus on what gets you going in other books."
4,Good book for beginners,"I turned to this book after trying to plough my way through the Microsoft book by Halvorson (weak) and the Wrox book by Wright (good, but heavy going). Walnum does a better job of breaking up the subjects and explaining their importance. The jokes get a bit annoying, as it's obvious the style that there must be at least one per page, but there is some useful information in here for beginners. I would suggest working you way through this and the Wrox book either sequentially or side by side."
2,Did I watch the same DVD?,"I am surprised to read the glowing reviews on this disc. I was very disappointed in this show. Fish, once a great and distinctive voice, is reduced to a mere shadow of his former self here. His recent material is written for his (now) very limited vocal range and is OK here because of that. The Marillion material shows just how far south Fish's voice has gone over the years. Listening to him 'sing' his old songs is almost painful. No range. No power. It's obvious the years of hard living have taken their toll. Combine that with a sub-par band (Frank Usher is good, but he's no Rothery) and you have a disappointing listening/viewing experience at best.How any Fish-era Marillion fan could find this DVD great is beyond me. If you want a much better option, seek out ""Live at Loreley"" (which isn't Marillion or Fish's best show either, but blows this away). This will only make you sad."
1,Lousy Product,After 3 calls to the manufacturer and the product still would not work I got a return authorization from Amazon and a credit has been issued. The product does not work!!!
3,Better when it first came out that it is today.,"In other words, this book no longer serves as THE history of the DCU.I am not sure if any one book CAN serve as a history of any comic universe, but just after the Crisis of 1986, this book did just that for DC.Then, as the years and stories and heroes came and went and changed, so did the history.And as comic fans know, History (some of us have to give it a capital ""H"" there, you know) changes with almost every issue of a comic and to some readers it is all-important to their reading of a given series and their enjoyment of comic books.The art is George Perez at his best.The text is fine for what it is. It does what it is meant to do: summarize in short blurbs origins and major events."
1,How did this garbage get published?,"I cannot believe this got published. It's okay as a rough draft of a book, maybe, but it needs a LOT more work to make it anywhere near interesting, much less believable. I just kept thinking that the author must have had little to no time to write this one. The dialogue is just awful, the characters undeveloped, and the plotline skips around. NOT her best work, and that's an understatement."
1,Weak! Weak! Weak!,"What happened to the gripping plots that I usually associate with Catherine Coulter? What happened to rich characterization and page turning suspense? This effort falls short in a plainly weak attempt. The characterization is thin and the plot lacks the intrigue that makes thrillers thrilling. The female lead in this novel is supposed to be strong, but comes across as weak. The bimbo at the gym served no purpose at all, and why was Wade's quest for Karen's job hammered into us at every turn? The Sheriff should have the skill to at least shoot where she's aiming. It was insulting to every small Sheriff's office in the southeast by the way the deputies were portrayed as incompetent and completely fallible. I grew more disgruntled as I plowed through this 370-page noose. By the last page, I felt cheated by the whole experience. Your time would better be spent in an afternoon nap than in reading this WEAK thriller that lacks intrigue."
3,Blindside,"I was disapointed with this book. It was boring at some points and had to force myself to continue, it lacked the zest that her previous books have had. The characters are great, but the plot need help. I have read all of her FBI thrillers to date and think that ""The maze"" was the best."
4,fbi thriller,"I am a great fan of Catherine Coulter.I do like this series,although I think I enjoyed the earlier books in the series.It is still a good read, suspensful and some twists to keep you reading on."
5,I liked it!!!!,"I just finished Blind Side and though I see lots of bad reviews on it, I rather liked it. I'm not going into the details of the book as so many have done that already. I thought it moved along and loved the kids in the story and also the relationship between Katie and Miles (perhaps not totally believeable that he would ask her to marry him having only known each other a few days but was okay by me). I enjoyed the action of Savich and Sherlock and how they dealt with the gal coming onto Savich. There is humor in the book as well as some mystery. I was entertained and just enjoyed the book."
3,Pottery girl,"The DVD on the Art of Japanese Pottery was interesting, but I was expecting a movie instead of photos. I wanted to watch their techniques so I could improve my own methods on the wheel. All in all it was a good documentary, but not what I wanted for the price."
5,Magic,This is quite possibly the best album I have ever heard. 'Are we here ?' gets my vote as Orbital's best ever song. Inspired stuff.
3,A mixed Orbital bag,"I was eager to purchase this CD when it was first released in 1994, having bought and devoured Orbital's two previous albums. I'll be honest - I was disappointed. Whilst not a bad album, this was not, in my opinion, up to the standards of their first two. I found after listening to this a couple of times that too many tracks sounded like fillers. Nevertheless, the final two tracks, Are We Here and Attached almost (but not quite) make up for a disappointing first three-quarters. Attached in particular, almost becoming a classical piece, such are the instruments employed on the track.It's one for the collection but definitely not the best."
5,an electronic classic,"Before I heard this album, I had doubts that electronic music could be emotional. I'd heard (and been entranced by) other Orbital classics such as ""Halcyon"" and ""The Girl With The Sun In Her Head"", both excellent examples of the duo's firm grip on transcendent electronic beauty. But it wasn't until _Snivilisation_ that I discovered the emotional range the Hartnoll brothers were capable of, in an otherwise automated and often superficial genre. This album is at once epic and intimate, hyper and somnolent, personal and political. A must-have in any electronic collection."
4,"Exceelent page turner, plausable plot, some literary license","This is an excellent Naval strategy novel of an all too plausable near-future scenario. My only quibble was choosing Germany rather than a more obvious possible culpret (North Korea, China) as the villain. The action here is nonstop, the plot plausable and the tension electric."
4,A solid read,"When I first read the summary of the book it reminded me of how real this could actually be. This book much like ""The Hunt for Red October"" had a genuine feel with the crisis between the US and Korea created by Germany. Jerusha Bailey I thought at first when confronted with this crisis at sea would take no crap, but she constantly allowed her first officer to talk down to her, and I thought Bailey would come storming back at her but in reality it didn't happen, but maby this what made the character believeable, and her attempt to stop a war was great. This book overall is a good book but there are parts about it that makes me scratch my head and I felt as if Bailey was being held back by the author. The cover of this book is great and made me buy it in a heartbeat. But I expected a little more, maby its because I read great books like ""Chooser of the Slain"" and ""Hunt for Rent October"". Overall a solid book but was still lacking something."
4,Very good,"This book is very good in practical knowledge, but it does not give good practise for MCSE exam."
2,"Buy any other book, but this one","This book does not cover all the basic and there are quite a number of errors, therefore, I do not recommand this book to anyone. The book I wanted was in back-order and I didn't want to wait, so I bought this IIS4 (sybex) coz I wanted to start my study asap, however, it is not worthed buying this book even though there was no better choice available, I should have waited for the back-order, so please everyone, try not to make the same mistake I did."
3,"Good in what it provided,but by no means everything you need","Good book for giving an overall coverage of IIS4, but I also used Fast Track, Electives in a nutshell and troytec.com study guides. Covered terms used in IIS4 quite well."
2,there's a fine line between subtle and dull,"I hate to rain on this parade, because Krush is a talented dude and I was really excited when I got this album. And it does have a few moments. ""Only the Strong Survive"" is a chill number. ""Duality"" with DJ Shadow is amazing, but the amazing part is mostly the second half, which sounds a lot more like Shadow than like Krush.A lot of the rest of the album is, literally, beats. The paths are literally drumloops for 45 seconds or so, reminiscent of one of those demo records that DJs mine for breaks, samples, and general turntablism madness. Whereas other records by DJs that I have (I'll mention Shadow again) are able to take bits and pieces of samples and craft emotional masterpieces, this one is just soulful grooves with sparse, denuded arrangements. There's just not that much there.So if you get this record, get it on vinyl, where it may come to more use. There is no point to having this on CD."

3,"Tanita HA 521-W Analog Bathroom Scale, White REVIEW","It's a lil bit off, 4 lbs to be exact. I could have bought a clearer, accurate and bigger weighing scale for the same price at Walmart. I could return it but I haven't got the time to do it and don't like to be hassled anymore."
4,"Compelling, moving, took me into a world I will never see","I read this book twice in a row. The first time, I simply couldn't put it down. The second time, I read it slowly, savoring the tales. The book tells of Soyland's many magic adventures as a diver and surfer, with a few others thrown in for good measure.He writes in a natural dialog manner -- the book would make a great audiotape. But that's also why I only gave it 4 stars. Like many self-published books, quite a few typos and grammatical errors are in it. I'm picky about that, but it didn't reduce my great enjoyment of the book at the time!"
2,"Not What I Expected,.",I did not realize that this CD consisted of the same song played over and over again. I felt like I wasted my money. I had heard another Havana CD which belonged to a friend and it consisted of all different songs.
5,Amazing Film,Really heartfelt and wonderful story. Superb acting and well directed. Highly recommend it!
2,breathless,"This CD was recommended to me and I have heard good things about Dr. Weil, but I have to say the CD's were a let down. The lecture was too long and i thought it would have been better to simply be text. The actual breathing exercises were not that inspiring and quite short. Although it was instructional to go through the breathing exercises along with the CD it would have been better if that part was expanded."
5,Stop Discontinuing Products that Work!!!,"Thermasilk Moisture Infusing Conditioner and Shampoo was the best thing that ever happened to my hair. Where is it and why did you discontinue it, Helene Curtis? This is the third product that a manufacturer discontinued that people were happy with (e.g., Elasta QP Perfect for The Wrap Silk Thermal Designing Liquid, Nexus Emergency and now this). Unbelievable!!! I mean, Downy is still around and still does a good job!!!"
5,Perfect snack for kids!,"These are the perfect snack for on the go. Actual REAL fruit--No sugar! No ""roll-ups"" with 10% fruit! They are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well. Just the right size for toddlers and small kids (and Moms too). Great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack. Works in any weather (won't melt) and even survives at the bottom of the purse! Comes in lots of flavors, an organic version, and bigger bars too for a bigger snack. Cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store. GREAT!!"

4,Accordingly Chomsky,"The battle of a linguist to reach a pinnacle of intelligent thought. As Howard Zinn does in Histroy, Chomsky questions the status quo and hypocrisies of power with the study of language in ""Chronicles of Dissent"". Deservingly broken down into gradual systematic subjects and into a more common vernacular (at times at interviewer David Barsamian's expense). Four out of five radical professors recommend it."
4,Better than more expensive models,"My other car has the more expensive brand. This one is slightly longer and the benefit from this is noticeable- it offers even better blind-spot vision. After you get used to it, you never have to turn your head to see if a car is hidden, and it even eliminates the need to use you side mirrors if you choose. The mirror narrows towards the left and right end so that it doesn't seem much more bulky than slightly smaller models, though.It does seem like this model is made from cheaper parts, but they still seem strong enough to last. I've had no problem with the rattling that others have mentioned after tightening the screws as directed. Very easy to install. I'd recommend this mirror over the competition."
2,A great mirror addition,"This mirror gives me complete view of my blind spots. The only problem I have had is that it doesn't attach firmly on my Prius. It stays on unless you bump it. Other than that, it's perfect.Update: The sad part about this mirror is that the mirror itself is breakable. My wife bumped the mirror and it cracked after hitting the console. Oh well!!! Had to toss it in the trash!!!"
2,View good but distorted by parabolic lense,"View good but distorted by parabolic lense. I was trying to get around the problem of a hatchback view of the 5 and 7 o'clock position (behind). The parabolic lense has a wider view, but the view is distorted for relative distance to objects in the 5 and 7 o'clock position."
2,Broke in package,The mirror came broken even though the box was in perfect shape. The bracket was to small to fit my thick back mirror and when it was installed did not show any different view than the present mirror. Did not send it back because of the return hassle. It ended up in the garbage.
4,See more while driving,You really can see more out to the sides although your own head is in the way on the drivers side. It also appears to change the distance as do all the new outside mirrors on the passengers side. I think that the more you use it the more comfortable it will become.
5,Driving safely,"I purchased this for my son a Navy veteran who had spine and neck surgery, making it difficult for him to turn his head a full forty five degrees. This mirror is a God send."
4,really small!,Everything is included in the shaker which is about 2 inches at most. Only problem: you need a magnifying glass to read the score sheet! Not kidding.

1,Disappointed,"I've been using Giovanni shampoo and conditioner for a while now but decided to buy the Shikai Natural Everyday conditioner to see how it worked for me since it was on sale. I have thick, long, naturally frizzy/wavy hair that I blow dry straight. Usually I can feel conditioner working. My hair will feel smooth and detangled almost instantly in the shower and when it's dry, it will feel soft. It did not feel that way during/after using this Shikai conditioner. I can normally run a comb or brush through my hair easily when it's wet after using my normal stuff, but not with this conditioner."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"Meh, not a fan of this conditioner. I have longer, fine hair and this product leaves it tangled when I get out of the shower. I have never dealt with so many fly-aways, static and general unruliness. Does not leave my hair feeling smooth or soft and if I were to use it sparingly as directed I may as well not use anything."
5,I believe this product works very well. The ...,"I believe this product works very well. The scent is light, but not a real heavy perfume. I feel it made my skin very soft. I would recommend it to my friends."
2,Informed Decisions - 2nd edition,"As an owner of the original ""Informed Decisions"" I was thrilled to see that there was an updated edition. I purchased the 1st edition when afamily member was diagnosed with cancer and it was a wonderful help -notto try to make decisions, but to know what to ask the doctors.I purchased the new edition in order to try to do the same for a familymember with oral cancer. What a disappointment!!! I expected to findupdated info about staging and survival rates, Not there!! Just a generaldiscussion that is not any more helpful than the information in ageneral use medical text, such as Merck's, Johns Hopkins, etc. If agood text is needed, find a used copy of the original ""Informed Decisions"" and check the data with your doctors."
3,Good beginner book- but....,This book is a good starting point to learning the interaction between VB6 and SQL Server. I found it did not go far enough into real life ADO issues and solutions. I have worked a great deal in MS Access and VB before SQL Server. I was looking for a book to bridge the gap between VB and SQL server that would cover some of the data access and manipulation techniques that I use in MS Access. It falls short on going into complex data extraction and bounces between client/server and web page presentations.
2,"Good format for a book, but ridiculously ERROR PRONE!",The author has the right idea about how to teach a concept by building an example and using the tools and telling you how to use them. The problem is the foundation is built on swamp land and ridiculous errors. You only get so far and then give up cause you have to fix all the 'mistakes'Not worth the time..
2,Different Code Versions for Book and CD,"If you write the code as written in the book, you'll end up with a program full of errors. The book is simply full of erroneous codes that you will tear your hair out trying to figure out where you made the mistakes. On the other hand, the code from the cd will run right out of the box and the projects are pretty decent. But this cannot overshadow sloppy editing and a poor excuse for the authors not trying the book themselves."
4,A Nice Companion to <i>Great Streets</i>,"This book belongs in the library of people who enjoyed GREAT STREETS by Allan Jacobs, et al, or anyone who designs modern streets. The authors have researched boulevards extensively, including their safety and utility.If you are interested in the topic, a video is available about the authors' research from the Institute of Urban and Regional Development of the University of California at Berkeley -- 510-642-5233. It believe it is called, ""Boulevards: Great Streets for Great Cities."""
3,Bold Move,"The book ""Carry Me Home,"" chock full of fascinating anecdotes and factual information, reveals the guilt of a Southern, white girl...who feels a deep force inside of her to expose her ancestors' shortcomings concerning their premise for white supremacy. Torn between her family and the truth, this book is a tell-all that reveals the McWhorters' role in the opposition to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s that altered Alabama's perception of the world drastically."
1,kindle edition is terrible,"Unfortunately, I did not start reading this until after the seven day return period for Kindle books. Had I started sooner, I would have returned it.The work itself appears to be very good, but the Kindle edition is horrible.There are so many typos and words runtogether, that it is difficult to read. I wish I could return it and just order the print copy.Beware of buying older books that have been tranferred to Kindle."
5,Gorilla stories!,"Like the other review on this page from Utah, this book was my all time favorite as a kid. Julius the gorilla! As a kid I appreciated the neat pictures. Their colors and the tone I'd feel from them, plus the dialog between Julius and Davy, was always a happy time whenever I spent time with the book. And really, isn't happy just what time with a book should be? The unusual name Julius also drew me into its pages."
2,Vending machine coffee tastes better,"I can't say I'd recommend this coffee. If not for the convenience, I wouldn't ever have rebought it, but now I've found a better choice for regular coffee in the Tassimo - either Starbucks Breakfast Blend, or Jacobs Kronung. Both beat this coffee hands down in flavor. The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to recently. Thin and yucky. Sorry, Gevalia fans. They make a good espresso, though, and the latte and cappuccino choices are much better.Pass on this one if you're not sure and try one of the others."
3,Calumny,"In his book, The Color of Water, James McBride states: ""I realized then that whoever had said kaddish for Mommy - the Jewish prayer of mourning, the declaration of death, the ritual that absolves them of responsibility for the child's fate - had done the right thing, because Mommy was truly gone from their world.""Kaddish is a prayer glorifying God that is said in honor of the deceased. It is not ""the ritual that absolves [the Jews] of responsibility for the child's fate."" That is one of the most bigoted statements I have read in a long time, and it is the statement of a person who should certainly know better."
1,Double standards,"Lets imagine that a Jewish author writes a book that features all the well known evil racist stereotypes of Afro-Americans. Everyone would be up in arms (justifiably) and condemn the book. Here we have a book penned by an Afro-American that contains many anti-Semitic stereotypes supposedly related to the author by his mother who pathologically rejected her Jewish roots, and everyone praises the book. I am both puzzled and offended. In addition if his mother had used the same child rearing practices 20 years later her children would have been sent to foster homes."
5,"Color doesn't matter, but the education that you acquire.","The book ""The Color of Water"" by James McBride is a heart-whelming story about a mother who raises her children that what's important in life is education and good morals, not by the color of the skin. She teaches them all that everyone is equal in the eyes of God just like the color of water that is made up of tons of colors. Reading this book is very motivating and inspiring because of the mother's struggles to raise her children the right way. After being through so much things in her past, she has learned to change things around in her way that is effective to her teachings. I recommend this book because it will touch you in a way that has touched my heart and will reach down into your soul and never forget."
4,This is a Gift,"This book is a touching memoir about a conflicted existence. But more than learning about his mother, I was challenged to consider my own perspective - - my assumptions and judgments about the people that I pass on the street every day.This book is truly a gift."
5,A Black Man's Tribute to his White Mother,"James McBride did a wonderful story on his mother's struggles throug a very racial time-period down south as well as his own struggles. I really recommend his mother, because not only did she have to deal with the critisms of many whites but also from the blacks in the community in which she lived. I can't imagine how hard it was raising 12 children on your own that all look Black. I feel that McBride did a wonderful job and I can't think of any other way that would improve how he constucted the story. I was never bored I was always indulged. This was a greaaaaaaaaaaat book!"
4,A Gem!,"I avoided this book a long time because everyone was raving about it. When at last it was in my hands, I was drawn in and flew through it - it is captivating! It does jump around a bit and at times I craved more detail on family members, on family moments. I adored the alternating chapters: one by Mommy, one by son. The ending was simple beauty and I cried. I don't remember the last time I did that at the end of a book. It's a must!"
4,Great Book!!,"It is a really good book. It shows the world that there are a lot of discriminations, especially to minor communities, happen everywhere. I really suggest that everyone should read this book so he can see for himself, what it is like to be discriminated. My hope that one day the time of discrimination will end."
2,"Nice, but, look elsewhere for insight.","A frustrating book as it could have been so much more. Ruth's is a potentially fascinating story, but this book is not it. The ""we are all of the human race"" theme is admirable, but obvious and not particularly well-presented."
4,An Inspiring True Story of Personal Triumph,"The Color of Water tells the remarkable story of Ruth McBride Jordan. This is an astonishing and inspirational narrative about one woman's strength to marry the man she loved in starting in the 1940's, at a time when interracial and interfaith marriages were taboo.This amazing woman went on to raise twelve biracial children in the projects of Harlem in the 1960's, all of whom went on to college and professional careers. Author James McBride eloquently interweaves part of his life story with his mother's and the result is a wonderful memoir that eloquently addresses race, religious, and identity issues.James McBride's beautifully written memoir is not only a tribute to a mother of a black man to his white Jewish mother; it is also about him realizing and coming to terms with his identity. The Color of Water is a very moving book and well worth reading. Highly recommended."
2,Superficial and frustrating,"This book came to me highly recommended and so I settled in for what I expected to be an enjoyable read. Unfortunately, I was disappointed and frustrated by the quality of the writing in this book. I got little sense of the characters and found the prose sloppy and contradictory in places. When glimpses of Ruth came through they were intriguing but for some reason they didn't fit together to create a three dimensional character.An obvious comparison is Angela's Ashes - it deals with some of the same themes but is far more vivid and engaging."
5,this is a good book,"The color of water is an autobiography of the author life. It contains stories about James's life as well as Ruth Mcbride, the author's mom life. I really enjoyed this book because it has a lot of interesting stories told by James and his mom. I would recommend readers to read this book because it is very well written. After reading this book, it had taught me about the life of people in the 30's through the 60's. It also taught me about the struggle many people encounter and how strong a person can be."
2,So honest I really disliked the author.,"Not that I disliked his being honest, but that he relates things that really put me totally out of sympathy with him - and he relates them with (seemingly) a total absence of shame or even regret! Put me way, way off. On the other side, I was very interested in his mother's story, and disappointed that we weren't told more. As a ""tribute"" to his mother, it was more self-centered than it should have been."
4,You've Got to Respect this Mother!,"I enjoyed this book about an Orthodox Jewish girl marrying and living in the black community. She raises 12 children through many trying circumstances. This is a true story written by the woman's son, James McBride. It is amazing the obstacles that the family overcame, as well as the successes of her children!"
5,Buy this book for your mother!,"This is one of the best books i have ever read!the racial issue between a black man's perception of his white mother is presented equally with the outpouring of love and respect he has for her; simply as a mother of 12 children in Harlem who put all her children through collge and grad school. the stories about trips to church, to camp, riding public tansport, getting homemade haircuts, and how awful a cook his mother was are universal and are presented evenly with the tender moments of love and respect and joy he has with his mother.the other half of this book is his mother's autobiography; the story of a young polish Jewish immigrant living in Jim Crow Virginia, abused by her father. the thinly veiled pain and anguish of memory that McBride's mother reveals futher illuminates his respect for his mother in his own chapters as he describes his mother founding a Baptist church in Harlem with his father.this book is a gift to mothers everywhere!"
2,I found the book to be puzzling.,"I didn't really like The Color of Water because when when I was reading the book at the beginning, I was puzzled when the stories changed and the characters who told them changed at the same time."
1,Politically Correct Anti-Semitism,"I found this book upsetting not only for its content, but because of the reception that it has received. Every single Jewish character reflected an anti-semitic stereotype - the mean Jew, the money grubbing Jew, the intolerant Jew, etc. The only exception is the mother who does eveything she can to become black. I couldn't blame her, since every black person was kind, accepting, responsible and generally a wonderful human being. Had the classes been reversed, the book would have quickly been labeled racist. I tried to find some redeeming value, but on top off its bigotry, the book was poorly written."
1,This might not even have made a good magazine article,"This is a purely awful book. Here is a guy who's entire group of siblings have been raised in an extremely difficult circumstance, each went on to advanced degrees, and he never asks what made their family special (other than their mother was white). He never peels the onion beyond the first thin layer. No questions are probed, other than where did his mother come from. When he finds the ""where"", there is no follow-up investigation, no probing of the family. This entire book would need more in-depth investigation or introspection to have made a good magazine article. As it is, it certainly does not fill a book."
2,McBride Master of Media Manipulation,"I marvelled at the tale, not the telling. I came away feeling tantalized, that there was the makings for a great book but the author had not given us his final draft. The book reads at times like a diary, giving some very intense facts but no insight into the why's and how's of this fascinating family. This book felt like the publisher's world version of the television ""sweeps"" week; where the delivered product never lives up to all the hype.Frank McCourt's book, Angela's Ashes, was a much more satisfying memoir. He also recounts a childhood of beating insurmountable odds to become a productive member of society. But McCourt captures the reader with his lyric compassionate style and unlike McBride, completes the characters and story so one is not left with more questions than answers."
2,"Strong family, not so strong book","Unfortunately, I didn't get the rave feelings that this title evoked in so many. I definately applaud Mrs. McBride for her remarkable child-rearing despite their hardships and the theme of a strong family core is always appreciated. However, overall the text was flat and redundant, the topic itself (confusion over racial identity)--although common and realistic--was very frustating, and no particular point of the book was expounded on enough to satisfy my concerns or curiosities. I appreciate its literary contribution but this story just disappointed and irritated me."
1,Nothing New After Page 40,"My definition of a worthwhile read, especially in memoirs, would be one that is compelling, insightful, educational, and/or new. One out of five stars because only about 20% of this book fulfilled the previous criteria, and nothing new was written after about page 40. This book had mass appeal potential, but in reality that appeal cannot be beyond those few that have had large-family interracial experiences."
3,One woman's awesome courage and accomplishments.,"Couldn't put it down - had to go straight thru this book at one sitting. Mr. McBride gives us the story in jagged pieces, the way he extracted it from his mother, so that we, the reader, get a strong sense of her reluctant telling. Altho' I wish he had given more color (than the color of water?) and substance to the other characters, I understand that in selecting the style that he did, it's as tho' visiting their crowded, hectic home for the first time and gathering impressions of the people, but not a depth of knowledge. This keeps the story focused on Ruth and James, where it belongs. His identity confusion, fear and anger growing up rang so true, (similar to feelings I remember having) that I was astonished. My congratulations to Mr. McBride. It's a beautiful, fine book and I've already begun sharing it with friends."
4,two lives @ a glance,"I read this book when I was in the 11th grade, I simply love it. I actually had to reread the first 4 chapters twice, because I was so confused at first. Tha authors style of writing and they way the book was split leaves you a little confused, but then u realize it is his life and then his mothers. I simply enjoyed this book. It not only discusses what life is like for a black boy, but for a white woman engaged in an interracial relationship and the struggles she faced. We so often hear about the Black struggle...its good to see boths sides for once!"
3,YOU SHOULD READ IT,cOLOR OF wATER is James Mc Bride's book. This book talks about two interesting stories:son's and mother's. Color of water is a very simple book that everyone can understand but what I do not like is when you change chapters you are confusing a little bit because the next one do not continue the same idea. For exemple the first one talks about the son and the second do not continue to talk about it. It changes and starts to talk about the mother. Other than that I think this book is well explained and can help people understand the question about racism. This book show you that the color of your skin is not the most important in someone life.It show also how someone (Ruth) can suffer and had the courage to raise her children. I think and I suggest everyone who has the possibility to read this amazing book.
2,no great expectations,"It's an easily read book, but nothing more. The subject and the strusture are offering nothing new. The strong point is the narration being vivid, but nothing more than that."
3,Interesting story that raises more questions than it answers,"The Color of Water raised many questions in my mind, especially in regards to how his mother was able to guide her children to receive the academic scholarships to prestigious universities. I would have enjoyed knowing more about his mother's current life. I hope writing this book exorcized the deamons he seemed to be anxious to rid himself of."
3,Unmet expectations,"Why didn't this book speak to me as it did to so many others? Somehow my expectations were not met; I found the book strangely flat when I expected it to sing. The title and the concept behind it captivated me. I thought ""the color of water"" a descriptively wonderful way for Mr. McBride's mother to make her point. And when Mr. McBride said he would unfold the story of his mother and ""betwixt and between"" we would find his own story, I was intrigued.Expectations are personal things, and I built my expectations on the above. And found myself disappointed in the reading. I felt the author told his story and betwixt and between was his mother's story - the reverse of his promise. Unfortunately for me, it was his mother's story and not his own which I found compelling. When speaking with her voice I found a power, vividness and intensity that grabbed my attention. Those same elements I found lacking in his story"
5,This is a wonderful book,I recommend this book to everyone who want to get knowledge about difference between black and white in the passed days in New York . This book is a very interesting bookwith a true story of James and his mother. I learned from this book that no matter what color of skin you are. You can love everyone without someone comand you or tell you who you have to love.
5,The Color of Humanity,"The book is beautifully written and has a lovely ""message"" which is not message-y or preachy at all. I am Jewish and maybe because I grew up in Washington DC in the 50's (which had a population predominantly African American) The Color of Water really spoke to me. In fact in many ways I felt he could have been describing my own mother for her beauty both physical and spiritual. However, I think this is a great story excellently told for anyone."
4,The Color Of Water,"It's interesting how faces change and issues stay the same. My bookclub enjoyed discussing this book and comparing it to our lives today and our parents lives referencing color, religion, our past and beliefs."
2,Very disappointing!!,"I read this book because of all the ""hype"" it got from people who had read and loved it. I was extremely disappointed to find a very lackluster rendition of this man's life. Although the story itself is a remarkable one, the writing was very mediocre. I was so surprised to learn the author was a journalist for this reason. I really think this story could have been written much more beautifully than it was. I wouldn't recommend this read to anyone since the essence of it can really be summed up in one sentence."
4,Uniquely Written,I have to admit when I first started reading the book I was confused on what was happening. Once I figured it out it was really easy to follow. I found both stories to be intriguing and left me wanting more. I would have liked to known why the second husband was living in a seperate home. Not knowing didnt take away from the story though. I read a review that said more should have been written about the siblings. I would have to disagree the book is his tribute to his mother. Telling the stories of James & Ruth was all I needed. Knowing the success of the siblings was enough for me. GOOD JOB JAMES!!!!
2,Stop crabbing..,"The only thing worse than reading this self-absorbed, whiny man's extended wallow in his petty what-ifs, is listening to him read it. He speaks with a lispy mush-mouth and can't maintain an level of volume. He'll start a paragraph with a clear full tone and then, like his writing, drift down to a sad mumble. I had to constantly fiddle with the volume dial to make out the words. I can only deduce that it was his vanity that compelled him to narrate his memoir, because he clearly doesn't have the skills for it.The book doesn't really tell us as much about middle age as it does about one man's perpetual dissatisfaction with life. As another reviewer said here, ""Stop crabbing, and count your blessings!"""
5,To say I'm impressed is an understatement.,"This review is coming from a man who grew up on 80's hair metal, plays the guitar, and listens to everything from Devo to Southen Culture on the Skids. I know good music when I hear it, and this album and artist will rise to the top with this fantastic album. It's in heavy rotation on my playlist now. SUPERB ROSANNE!"
3,Not As Good As Advertised,"This album got a lot of hype when it came out, most notably in a NEWSWEEK cover story on Cash. This is her first recording since the death of her father and stepmother.Because of the publicity, I expected more. Cash has a good, but not great, voice and the songs are interesting, but not particularly memorable."
3,Ok book if you can get past the narrator,"I can see why this book falls in the middle. Some loved it and some hated it. For me it was just OK. The problem I had was the terrible narrator. Ms. Merlington has a monotone voice and horrible accents. I had a very difficult time listening to her, which probably made the book even less enjoyable than had I read it myself. It really is painful to listen to this woman. Do sample the audio before you purchase this audio book."
5,Great bio of a classic band,"As someone who refused to even listen to the latest Jane's album (i'll only acknoledge the first 3!), didn't know what to expect from this book, a cheap attempt to wring some cash from an ever-diminishing fan-base? But Jane's is one of those bands... true innovators, and this book is a terrifically detailed account of their story. I was really impressed by the vast amount of interviewees the author was able to bring together in a very coherent manner, including Casey Niccoli and Eric Avery. A must for true fans."
3,Spelling Mistakes,"I found several spelling errors in the Persian text. In one case the word for Chameleon is spelled wrong - the main character. And in other cases it looks as if the publisher used Arabic analogues for letters instead of the Persian equivalent. I'm not sure, I don't know Arabic. But you can see this on the cover of the book: at the end of the title where it says ""mi konad"" mi has two dots underneath it, which I think is normal for Arabic, but incorrect for Persian. This is persistent through the book's 10-or-so pages."
5,"You want the part? Read this book, now.",The moment I read the introduction I was hooked. Silver uses humor and wit to bring to life these practical and useful methods he shows you to give a flawless performance. He teaches you everything from how to relax before an audition to how to become the part. I can not describe to you all how much I am in debt to this man for teaching me the way to a auditioners heart. Mr. Silver will not let you down.
5,Worth Every Penny - Healed My Skin!,"I've been living with extremely dry skin due to the winter months and excessive hand washing. My hands were badly cracked and bleeding every day, painful to the point of throbbing. I tried everything: natural moisturizers, coconut oil, olive oil, wearing gloves each night while sleeping, drinking a lot of water, supplements, nothing worked. This product was recommended to me and I was amazed. The moment I applied it my hands began to heal. I couldn't believe it. Within two days my hands were 95% healed. No more cracks, blood, or pain! I only used a tiny amount of the product (applied it twice a day for the first day or so and now only use it every other day or so.) This product truly soaked into my skin. My hands still feel hydrated even after washing multiple times. It is also greaseless. It's wonderful. I wish I'd found this years ago. I'm not one to readily hand out 5 stars, but this one easily earns it."
2,Disappointing,This book was a real disappointment. It's only positive feature was it passed the time whenever I had difficulty sleeping. The book never went anywhere. Two stars is probably generous.
4,liked it,"the book could of been longer, i feel like it was a little rushed in the end. Other then that is was a good sequel, looking forward to the next"
3,I hate to give Mr. Card a low rating anytime,I just didn't enjoy these books like some of his others. It is a long journey across time and space and the subject matter should have been a easy win. It just wasn't this time. I would still read anything he writes anyway. He is on my rather long short list of favorite authors!
3,Not as good as the first three but still pretty good,"I was actually quite let down by Earthfall. If you've read the first brilliant three in the Homecoming Saga you'll recognise that the story is a huge build up of tension and competition amongst the characters. Well I know it could only go on for so long, and the tension finally erupts in some places... but the big build up, between Nafai and Elemak... well it's builds up and up during the whole book again... and then everything is let down in the last few pages. An anti-climax, I can't tell what happens without spoiling things but new plot lines have taken over that have ended that brilliant one. Unless the final book in the series can redeem Earthfall, to me, it's an anti-climax."
2,Wrong Product,The control solution sent was the wrong test product for the Accu-chek Advantage meter that I use. It was for another Roche product. I kept getting wrong readings with this product and finally called Roche and found out that I was sent the wrong testing solution.I ordered testing solution from Roche that corrected the problem.
2,Latest Gur not up to her usual standard,"Gur here provides too much exposition (work environment, characters at national TV and police headquarters) at the expense of plot and character development. Further, the novel is weakened by the extravagant significance given a single war-time atrocity. Benefit of the doubt - maybe the author didn't have time to polish the ms, apparently completed just before her 5/05 death. Start with Saturday Morning Murder and read the other four. Only read this if you already know the series & want to see what she does with her long-running characters."
1,"Does not work properly, email 4 times never answer. not recomended","Less than a week after I purchased, the mouse did not work properly, try everything, change batteries 3 times and still does not work. receptor is 2 feet away and give a lot of problem. Email the supplier 4 time and never answer, he does not care about warranty or service, do not recomend any one to purchase from them."
5,Good key board and mouse combo,I had the same key board with the optical mouse (ex-110). It was cheaper to get the combo then replace the mouse only. The new laser mouse is a nice upgrade.
3,"weird layout, otherwise ok","as someone pointed out, layout of the delete/home/end/pageup/pagedown/insert keys is intolerable.i have tried for quite a few days to get used to it but it keeps annoys me.F9-F12 are strangely located far away from F1-F8. This is lesser of an issue to me though since i rarely use beyond F6.if you are concerned you can check the image and decide if that's what you want.range is about 8 feet which is not a problem for me. i don't use them more than 3 fee away anyway.numlock/capslock indicators are on the usb receiver instead of the keyboard itself.since i place the receiver on the case, which is on the floor under my desk, that creates a little bit of inconvenience at times.no other complaints so far. keyboard feels comfortable and the mouse is pretty good (might take a few seconds to react at start up but that's it)."
2,Wouldn't Recommend,"The only good thing I can say about this is that it's wireless, it works, and I like the extra buttons on the mouse. That's why it doesn't get 1 star.On to the bad things. As another reviewer said, it doesn't work beyond 6 feet. I originally bought it to use in the living room for watching movies on the PC, but it's worthless for that purpose unless I sit close to the computer. Also, it has to be in line of sight of the receiver since it's not RF.After less than 6 months of use, the mouse is starting to flake out. The right button doesn't work consistently.Finally, just as a matter of preference, I HATE the way the Home, End, Del... button group is laid out!! I use these buttons all the time and they're not consistent with traditional keyboards, so I'm constantly hitting the wrong keys.Other than it working (for 6 months), I can't really say anything good about this mouse or keyboard."
4,Handshower,Really like this handshower. Being a short person I can adjust it to my height so I don't get hit in the face with water. When I'm through I can remove it to rinse down the shower so it doesn't have to be cleaned as often. When I travel I realize how spoiled I've become with this.
5,"We saved $90,000 by building ourselves",Great book. It helped us a lot. This book helped us gain the confidence that we needed to do it ourself. It's the best of the books I read on the subject.
1,A Worthless Smithco Marketing Piece,"This book was extremely disappointing...it is nothing more than a ""puff-piece"" brochure for the many products that the authors sell. There is very lttle of any substantive use ....some teasers and lot's of testimonials for their tapes, CD's etc. People building their own home will find that ""The Complete Guide To Contracting Your Home"" is an infinitely better investment."
1,Designed by Committee,This book is clearly an example of what happens when there are too many cooks in the kitchen. In this case it is many contributors leading to a confusing number of styles. It appears that the book was designed for entry level college courses not for the Authorware developer. What is needed for Authorware productivity is a book similar to Director Demystified by Jason Roberts and Phil Gross.
1,extremely disappointing,"I enjoy reading business books - but this one was a waste of time and money, and a major disappointment (as a joint project between a former partner at McKinsey and 2 professors from Harvard and Dartmouth, one would expect a book worth reading!).Aside from identifying the 4+2 factors that came out of the authors' research (you can read what those are in comments from other readers, and save yourself time and expense), the book sticks to platitudes and gives very little real insight. Does not hold a candle to such books as ""from good to great"" or ""execution""."
3,Air Power Review,"I have recently purchased this book. I love to read about technology history, especially aircraft. So far the author has spent too much time and detail on the flight history of WWI. It is interesting but a little slow. I hope the book picks up. I would recommend this book."
5,A Cult Classic that Deserves to be Remade,"Invasion of the Bee Girls (aka Graveyard Tramps) is one of my favourite sci-fi films from the 1970s. Roger Ebert has given it 3 stars. Released in 1973, it was written by Nicholas Meyer who directed Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn. The acting and dialogue is consistently good throughout unlike many low-budget B-movies of that era. Invasion of the Bee Girls is a film that will certainly offend some sensibilities as it has a fair amount of nudity in it. There is one scene in particular that I certainly didn't like-- the scene in the alley when a group of men attack a blonde. That was quite revolting.Invasion of the Bee Girls is a genre-bending film that includes detective fiction elements, feminist overtones, and mild horror schlock. The feminist elements may not be obvious to the casual viewer, but the plot element of housewives turning into bee girls and doing a fatal number on the men of the city truly makes it a girl-power movie!"
3,Not nearly as good as Green Street Houligan's,We bought this movie after seeing Green Street Houligan's and wanting to know more about England's firms. This wasn't as great though. I would recommend renting it- definitely not purchasing.
4,Great wacht but with a major drawback,This is a great watch for travelers. One of the nicest things is that there is a sharp contrast between the dial and the hour and minute hands so hour is clearly visible. The ONLY MAJOR DRAWBACK is the lack of backlight that is very useful in dim situations when digital hour is needed.
5,Rated G! (Mid-West/SoutSide Classic Listen),"This album is for those who want the essence of the 90's and true Hard Core Gangsta RAP! This album unfortunately got lost in the shuffle due to other album coming out during this time frame. You had Outkast's ""ATaliens, 5th Ward Boyz..Same titled album which was also a CLASSIC, along with EAST Coast's Method Man and the emergence of Jay Z and 2PACS ""Me Against tha World"". Plainly said it was a tough year to release a album. But, nonetheless this was well received down SOUTH. You could hardly walk around a corner and not have a car sitting at a ""RED LIGHT"" not bumping this. This album was particularly popular with local GANG Members during this time especially the Gangsta Disciples. This album even though lost in the shuffle would easily outplay any album from most new artist today. This album is only for those who want to get a greater understanding of the urban ghettos in the early and mid 90's."
5,Liked it. I bought it in 2006 still working great,Liked it. I bought it in 2006 still working great. Recommend others to buy it. Its strong and durable. you can gift it to friends
4,"Fills the bill for us; classic look, breathable, holds a ton","Would give it 5 stars if we didn't have to wrestle a little bit with the hanger framework; takes a bit (but just a bit) to get it off and on, and to keep the hanger adjusted where you want it, i.e., either hanging parallel to the bag (like, say, if you were hanging the bag against a door on a hook) or at a 90-degree angle (like, say, if you were hanging it in a closet). But we love the clean lines, neutral color, and breathable fabric, yet solid (cotton duck-like material) so you don't have to look at all your dirties. Drawstring top makes it easy to toss it around when gathering up all the bags on laundry day. Each of our kids now has one of their own; super convenient. I think it would be more useful to put the zipper at the bottom than at the back, but that's just me. Am thinking it might hold toys nicely as well . . . ."
5,GOVERNMENTAL GAAP GUIDE - MILLER REVIEW,"THIS GUIDE IS EXCELLENT FOR THE USE OF THE PRESENTATION OF GENERAL-PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IT GIVES DETAIL EXPLANATIONS OF HOW INFORMATION SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ARE WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WITHOUT HAVING TO READ INTO THE EXPLANATION. UNLIKE SOME OF THE AICPA BOOKS THAT ARE OUT THERE, WHERE IT READS LIKE IT IS IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGE BESIDES ACCOUNTING. IT IS A VERY PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INCREASE THE CORRECT PRESENTATION OF YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ALSO AID IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CORRECT ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS FOR YOU GOVERNEMTNAL SITUATION."
1,I didn't like this cream at all. It ...,"I didn't like this cream at all. It has a strong chemical odor and it stung my face when I used it. I thought the burning feeling would go away after a few days but it didn't. I didn't notice any improvement with my skin at all. However, the cream comes packed in a pretty blue jar, but that was the only thing I liked about it."
4,A good introduction to the subject,"A thorough study, well written, interesting to read. Especially the part about the early days of sniping. Post WWI conflicts aren't covered in much detail. The chapters on theory of sniping and ammunition are very short to be comprehensive but still offer a decent introduction. The list of books at the end is a useful source for continued reading."
2,You can do better.,"Purchased this to replace one we purchased at Walmart about 10 years ago. We had to replace it because the suction cuts had torn off but it never leaked. What we received did not match the picture in the listing (our old one looked like the picture so I was hoping it would be as good). The new one is not as wide or as cushioned as the old one. Lastly, the thickness of the material is noticeably thinner. On the positive side, the four suction cups work well to keep it in place and it has a smooth surface (not terry cloth) which make it easy to keep clean. Save your money and buy it elsewhere for several dollars cheaper."
1,BEWARE! This product does not fit on a 2005 Kawasaki ZX636 Ninja ZX-6R,Product description states that this item fits on a 2005 Kawasaki ZX636 Ninja ZX-6R BUT I found out the hard way. The stock rear sprocket for this bike has 43 tooth and this comes with 40 tooth sprocket with a 108 chain so your gearing will be off.
1,Hilarious Human Error,"It is amazing how two totally ""different"" artist can have the same name and the fans (who obviously never ran into this coincidence) get caught slippin' and waste money. Well, this particular CD entitled Psychodrama is NOT from Chicago, nor are they rappers. Actually, I believe the name of this group is Ultraviolence (duh!). In the future, one day soon...we will all be able to have the same name with a microchip installed in the back of our necks for identification. Until then...please ""preview-research"" item before purchase."
4,The Almost,"Southern Weather by the almost lets Gillespie put a different, more melodic side of himself on display. The hit track Say This Sooner really sucks you in and having it the first track on the cd leaves you begging for more and the rest of the cd really comes through."
3,somewhat ambivalent,"First, if you read the review from the guy from Houston, and you felt it was filled with the easy knee jerk libertarian argument (""we have crappy culture and car-dominated landscapes because we want and chose them; it's all OUR fault since we CHOSE all this FREELY."") and you really believe he's right, then don't read White's book. That would be like a born again Christian reading the case for atheism. If you would like antidotes to this sort of DISNEYWORLD thinking, then White can be helpful. I'm a little ambivalent about the book myself, but when criticisms like # 14 fill the air, something needs to be done, however inadequately."
2,Annoying,"I made it to page 80 or so before I grew sick of searching through the sea of names and book references for coherent points. This is a huge exercise in some sort of nerdy name-dropping (verbose, self-important humanities-nerdy), and I will personally guarantee that you have never heard of the majority of the names, college-educated, avid reader though you may be."
4,Classic country sound.,"Most all tracks are great. Only exception is ""Son of a preacher man"". It has been done by way to many different people. Otherwise the rest of cd is great. Can tell she put her heart in it. Never got the credit she diserves when came out, still a very different sound from ""todays"" singers.Take a listen, you will enjoy it also."
4,Good Overview of European Hostels.,"I bought Hostels European cities when I was planning a multi-country trip. I was going to be stopping only in large cities, and found that only one of the cities I was looking for was not listed in the book (Cologne). I found that it was a very comprehensive guide, and really helped me alot. Now that I've changed my trip to just Germany, I'm planning on buying the Hostels German Cities. I love their format, and really appriciate the information in the book. One should keep in mind, of course, that Hostels European cities is only about 400 pages. It covers 18 countries. Of COURSE they're not going to have every city. They'll have a few major cities from each country, because this is a EUROPEAN guide. If you want more specifics, buy a more specific book. If you want an over view of one or two major cities per country, then its a good book."
2,not really a beginner bird,"Although it is advertised as great for beginner it isn't. I had been flying rc planes for years and wanted to try heli. Local hobby shop said this would be great. The CX2 should NOT have been my first heli. Too expensiveget a cheap little micro indoor syma first. Teaches the basics WAAAY better than crash, burn, order parts, wait, try to fix,and repeat."
1,Very Disapointed,"When I purchased the CX2 I was told it was very stable. However I could never get it to hover. It would always slide off onto a different direction every time. My Flt Controller had trim knobs which needed to be in 100% trim. Unfortunately there was never enough trim left over to actually trim it into a stable vertical hover. I was expecting to have trim knobs in a near neutral position but when it was never enough, there was no controlling it. $200 dollars is a lot of money to me and I expected value for my money of which I received none. I have been looking at other hellos and people are recommending the Blade 400 ($475) but based on the quality of its smaller cousin, I will not buy it. You would think that you could add gyros so that you get true stable flight. I dont need a arobatic zip here and there Helo. I just want one that has great quality that's worth the money."
2,fun but fragile,"my wife purchased this heli for me for christmas, the told her at the store it was pretty much unbreakable, first flight broken lower rotor, second flight broken body rear, third flight broken body nose, bent stablizer bar, busted battery holder,long story short this heli it made to break everytime you land harder then a feather.Im a long time rc racer, donot understand why the heli body is not made of lexan which would not break when you touch it.seems to me like it was designed to break to sell replacement parts"
2,"Informative, but without passion","Vernon Jordan was passionate about his work. Unfortunately, none of that passion is conveyed to the reader. Simply stating his accomplishments, interspersed with his exposure to the ""Who's Who"" of the civil rights movement, and a sprinkling of anecdotes doesn't convey the depth of the man. Although the book is informative, it lacks depth and leaves us wondering who Vernon Jordan really is."
3,Fun to start with,I really enjoyed this game in begining as i really like table tennis a lot but this game gets very frustrating very quickly as the 3rd or 4th guy is like impossible to beat with the speed and spin that they play with. i gave up after like 5-10 tries and now this game is just collecting dust.
3,Ok read,I don't know what I thought this book would be about but I was hoping for a little more Notre Dame stories. I did learn a lot about Coach Weis and have become a bigger fan of the Irish and him after reading the book. Just not enough Irish stories to really keep me into the book.
5,"The ""Perfect"" Book","No need to search any further for the ""perfect"" book on your spiritual path. This is it...Cover to cover is filled with every teaching one needs to remember,and the Grace to be the Love we all long to know."
4,TELLS THE STORY,"What a neat book that no one seems to know about. On the cover is two vets looking at the wall with their arms around each otherThis is a kid's book and what a wonderful way to explain what happenedThis book tells the story about how many Americans were felt about war and how we got involved. Then it talks about the fund for the memorial and how it was built.Included are many pictures. The writing, I feel is incredible. It handles the subject in an incredible way!Mostly it is about building the wall and how it happened.The background about Vietnam says it in a nutshell and without bias"
5,We need more of these!,"Well, if you trust the opinion of one guy that issued a mere one star for the material, then you certainly aren't ready for the information in this book! However, if you're a genuine system administrator that needs to have easy access to detailed registry information without having to crawl the web, then this book is very well worth having. The whole point of the book is to delve deeper than GUI utilities like TweakUI and actually get to the meat of HOW things are done. Whether making registry changes from remote, via scripts, or locally, knowing where the right information is located is much more educational than shined up utilities.While the book does go to some extremes in repeating some non-essential information, the overall value of the book is not badly diminished. I've been dealing with the Windows registry for years now, and I can't say that I have it all memorized. Grabbing a quick reference like this Little Black Book is a time saver... period."
1,"Step One, Read This Review, Step Two...","The book is 453 pages that could have been condensed to 200 if the author had given the reader a little credit in being able to remember ""Step 1, find the registry editor"", ""Step 2, open the registry editor""... EVERY SINGLE Tip starts out this way... Come on... Give me some credit... Most of the ""tips"" can be just as easily accomplished using TweakUI or similar software. There are a few tips worth reading, but nothing that can't be found on the web. Save your money on this one folks.."
3,"Zen Garden Video Nice, Music selection repetitive","The video portion is very nice. However, the music is repetitive and the clacking bamboo in the music after 20 minutes is so distracting that I muted the sound. Natural sounds only of water, birds, etc. would have made for a much better presentation."
5,Ratt smokes !!,"How can you go wrong with this CD---it has all of Ratt's best stuff. Even the song from Point Break kicks. I have to agree with one of the people who reviewed ""Detonator""---the tune ""Givin' Yourself Away"" is the BEST rock ballad ever written by any 80's hard rock band."
3,case broken on arrival,"cd arrived in the same package with a GPS I ordered. The cd was below the GPS and when I opened it the plastic case was broken, though no damages to cd. Too hassle to send it back, so I think I will keep it."
4,Great book so far,"I purchased this book for my husband who has recently finished seminary courses in Biblical Hebrew. He has become a little rusty on his New Testament Greek also. I thought this book would be excellent for keeping up with the Biblical languages a little at a time. Each day there is a verse or two in Hebrew from the Old Testament, and also a verse or two in Greek from the New Testament. There are some notes on the Hebrew, although they are primarily in German. My husband really just wants to study the languages using the tools he has learned, and didn't want the notes from another scholar. There are two volumes of this book, but I bought this first volume based on the review of another Amazon customer. So far we are happy. I did buy the book used to save some money, but it is a nice clean copy."
5,Great Reading!,"I just finished reading the book. It is wonderfully written and very hard to put down. The author's style of story telling is very engaging and flowing. I enjoyed the novel especially because it is the first time I read a high-quality English novel WITH a desi (Indo/Pak) theme [probably reflects on my limited exposure to the subcontinent's English writers]. Since I am from the same background, I especially enjoyed the local Urdu/Punjabi phrases/terms interspered throughout the book. It could be a bit distracting for the non-desi readers to encounter so many foreign terms [some of them not fully explained]. I almost suspect that the author was primarily writing for desi readers. I also enjoyed verses and translations quoted from famous Indian/Pakistani poets. The novel effectively touches upon a great human tragedy without being judgemental. Great reading, all around! Highly recommended."
1,Good writing marred by author's racist prejudice,"I must agree with an earlier reviewer: the book is well written but betrays the author's racist prejudices. That is a tragedy, for it is these very prejudices that were behind the break up of India fifty years ago.M. Prasad. Minneapolis, MN"
1,Simply a story coming from an illiterate Bapsi Sidhwa.,The book is nothing but a waste of time and if anything else a way to let out Muslim hate toward any other religion. It simply has no historical meaning because of its way of potraying the scene that was so hard on the real patriotic population of India. It seems like Sidhwa only writes this book to live in some kind of a hallucination and denial to get away from the fact that the whole reason for the pain in the partition was non other than her own Muslim population. Reading this book will never in a million years give anyone the true picture of the real partition but to be honest it has good writing style.
1,Beware of bad design!,"This is an amateurish hack of a game. The bugs are numerous, the support 'fixes' are arcane, and the overall effect left me unimpressed. I've played Freeware games designed with far more finesse.This is a poorly designed product, and I can not begin to list the many levels of sloppy programming that must have taken place.The support, while detailed, required too many steps to warrant my time. Perhaps a few hours with a PS2 game will erase the taste this game left in my mouth."
4,N Scale Bachmann Coaling Station,This Coaling station helps complete my railroad yard. It's another well made addition to my newly formed N scale town.
5,Remarkable you will not believe it's live from 1972,"This Dead live recording created in Germany 1972 contains a live set that is done perfect. I am still amazed when I listen to it. The fact that this recrording was live, it sounds like a studio recording. The band plays tight and with real feel on this recording. I can recommend this to die hard fans or day to day fans that might just want to hear this band in there first 5 years, and in there prime."
4,ChinaCatSunflower,This album has one of the best recorded versions of China Cat Sunflower I've ever heard! It's worth buying the whole album just for that song!
3,"""Hundred year hall"" only something else in places","""Hundred year hall"" is not as rewarding to me as it seems to be to others. Especially the first cd in this set has little to offer that hasn't been performed better on other occasions. For example, I think both ""China cat/I know you rider"" and ""Jack Straw"" sound better on ""Europe '72"". The second cd offers us something else, though. ""Truckin'"" (although slightly marred by the fact that Bob Weir doesn't know his lyrics) and ""Cryptical Envelopment"" really take us to places that we hadn't seen before - and that's the true merit of ""Hundred year hall"". A sweet ""Comes a time"" follows and a fine ""Sugar Magnolia"" ends the cd.Certainly, I did enjoy ""Hundred year hall"" as a whole, but it would've been just nice if it wasn't for the ""Truckin'/Cryptical"" jam. All other songs can be found in better shape on other releases.Hans Wigman."
5,great for LA teachers and SLP's,I am a speech-language pathologist. I treat language disorders and this is a great reference book.
3,This is of high quality but sometimes may be of an acquired taste,"I will not try to analyze this since other reviewers have done an excellent job.""Superman's Song"", ""The Ghosts that haunt me"" and ""Winter song"" are gorgeous songs.The only thing that needs to be highlighted is that the vocalist's baritone voice is so unique that it brings a certain dynamic to the songs where they all may start sounding a bit similar. This is essentially folk music but the singer's low, low, low voice overpowers the beautiful subtlety of the music.There's good musicianship and excellent, heartfelt songwriting but I question whether the vocals gives the Crash Test Dummies their identity or does it diminish some of these songs?"
2,MMM MMM-HUMM?,"It's obvious that the ""Dummies"" were on a time scedual or something. They must be tired rushing through such an appalling excuse for music. There sound is that of a drunken robot that needs to be recharged. NO ARTISTIC MERIT. That should say it all but unfortunatly it doesn't."
1,"If you know ben, you will not appriciate it","okay i dont know much about crash test dummies... i saw them on one hit wonders on VH1 the funny thing is that thier music is so droney (is that a word??) I was half on the computer and half listining to this program and that song made me turn my head because it sounded so angstful and sounded like a person on crack's lullaby.... I had this boyfriend named ben and he had absolutly no skills or talent but he wanted to be a starving artist type so he decided to play the same chord over and over and play a pearl jam like deal. The thing is, it sucked and sounded just like these guys. If you try to immitate these guys you will realize that you can ""sing"" this way too. But i give them props because they did absolutly nothing and made some money. I guess Ben will have to wait for people like you to recognize his talentless and buy his albums so he can go buy legos"
2,Product ok but definitely not great.,"I purchased this product because of the promised lasting affect but it did not live up to the promise. As is true with similar products, it dried my lips very quickly and caused the color to flake off within a short period of time. There is a similar product called My Lips Are Sealed available in drug stores priced 80% less and it works the same as this product. EI Solutions Lip Last does not have the initial sting as the lower priced product, however, the results are the same."
4,"Good listening, but not essential","This CD has its high spots (Death Don't Have No Mercy, That's it for the Other One, & Dark Star), but most of the remainder is pretty predictable, albeit enjoyable, live Dead music.Deadheads will want to own this CD, but there are other CDs I would recommend first for someone who wants only two or three Dead CDs on their shelf."
3,"Pop-Punk, same ol story","Well, it seemed to me like MxPx was another one of those trendy pop-punk skater bands, and maybe they are, but they manage to make some really catchy songs! This Cd is a bit long (72 minutes) and after a while the songs start to sound the same (it IS punk, after all,) but there is some really good gems on here. Probably the best are:""Never Learn"",""Begin to Start"",""Let it Happen"" and ""Move to Bremerton."" Their cover of ""Oh Donna"" is pretty good too."
5,Great Cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A Must Get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All you MxPx fans out there get this cd!!! I knoe it may not ""Be Their Best"" or it may Not ""Rock On!"" but it is just a great cd to start with or to end with! This cd has 32 songs including ""Let It Happen"", ""Move To Bremerton"", ""Chick Magnet"" and ""Sick Boy""! This album i longer then thier other albums ( Time about 1 and 1/2 hours)! I love this album and all u slow rong/ punkers will love it! But people who like MxPx's more punky/ yelling form may not like it but it is a great cd to add to your collection and I listen to it all the time! So All of you GET IT!ROCK ON MxPx(...)!"
1,"God awful ""punk""","Oh man 74 mins of torture , I was forced to listen to this CD when a friend asked me to make a copy of it cos their tape player wasn't working , but anyway this SUCKS . I mean every song sounds EXACTLY the same , they are slow , boring , and just terrible , I never bothered to listen to MXPX because of their mainstream acceptance , and I'm glad I never did , because listening to this was the worst 74 mins of musical torture I had ever been put through."
1,sick boy?,"is this a cover of Social D's sick boy? and if youre looking for a good album, get one of theirs."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,"A friend gave me 1906 for a gift, and from page one I could not put it down, something that has not happened to me in awhile. I don't know what I loved more, the incredible portrait of old San Francisco, or the description of the earthquake as it rips through California, or the portrayal of Enrico Caruso, one of the funniest and most endearing characters I've ever read. I loved the action, the characters, but most of all the history and the descriptions. This book is a lot more than a disaster novel. After my husband reads it, I'm going to read it again."
4,Good if your just starting out.,"Great for beginners, but a little too entry level for me. John can be a bit corny at times too but over all, it is good if your just starting out."
1,?????????,"What is Gavin Rossdale thinking? This album is horrible. Bush in their day were mediocre at best, and always desperately bland. This however is terrible. The songs are boring Nu-Metal folks. Gavin rossdale is once again about 5 years behind the curve and is now offering the ignorant audiences Nu-Metal for 2005. 10 Years Ago he gave us grunge 5 years after the fact....I guess he has come a derivative full circle."
4,A good Effort,"There are to many bands out there today that sound like crap. I not even going to bother listing them. Its just today most new bands that came out in the last 3 years seem to lack the talent that the older bands of the last 15 years. Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Alice and Chains, Nirvana, Bush, GreenDay, Weezer, so on and so forth.Institue trys to bring back some of that real rock sound that many people have been missing for years.People need to give this Record a chance. Considering I have not heard any air play on my Local ""so called"" Alternative stataion. What is Alternative today anyways? Most bands today sound like Preppy Rock. Stuff we see on MTV 30 times a day. And we forget about them a year or so later.Check out Institute!!!!!!!!!"
2,Meh?,I really wish I wouldn't have bought this CD. It has only two songs that are actually somewhat good. Honestly...a CD with a song that talks about being Deep fried in the heat of your love shouldn't be bought. If anyone buys this CD thinking it will be like Bush...it's not.
2,"Interesting topic, not great prose.","Being from a town in New England with a large number of the featured haunted inns, I was excited to read this book. I was even married at one and my grandmother worked at another in the 1930s. I did learn a few things about the history of the inns, which was great. Unfortunately, the writing was... off. I laughed out loud at several bits (one innkeeper had a ""never-ending seven year dispute"" with a zoning board) and cringed at others, especially the parts that seemed to kowtow to every inns' staff. It read like a school project rather than an actual professional finished glossy product. The book really could have done with an editing overhaul to make the stories more easily appreciated."
4,Come and visit. The ghosts are waiting for you.,"Haunted Inns of New England is a fun book to read while you are lying in bed. Don't forget to keep a pen and note paper on your night table, just in case you want to visit one of these inns and need to write down their name. New England is a great place to visit. Not too big, not too crowded and not too expensive. It has many different types of attractions and Haunted Inns are just one of them. Don't forget the haunted pubs (sorry that's another book!) Come and visit. The ghosts are waiting for you."
4,I think this cd rules for the most part.,"I think this cd rules!! It has many catchy beats, and tunes. It also has nice brass lines and other things. But, i was slightly disappointed with the fact that it only has like 8 songs (and one if 7 seconds long.) I wish it were longer."
5,this is there best cd yet,"I've heard this cd a lot, and I was just at one of there concerts and I enjoy them very much.On a nother note I would like to say to the guy from NY that if you respect the bands music, mabye looking at what they believe wouldn't be so stupied. I'm not saying that if you're not a christian you don't have a right to listen to christian music, just don't insult them for the message there presenting. And it is the best message you could ever hear."
4,Good but not quite up with their previous releases.,"I'd say that if you're a FIF fan, you'll enjoy this recording but find it a bit less appealing than previous releases. The songs aren't as catchy and conducive to singing along, but still have many great notes and a decent rhythm. I'd still drive to Denver to see them play these songs though!"
1,This wiper blade did not fit,"I bough 19"" and 26"" PIAA replacement silicone wiper blades refills. I used the chart to select the size for a 2010 Toyota Prius. The length was fine but the width was narrow because my car takes a wider width. I read were a lot of people were having this same problem. This company should go back and redo there chart so they will have the right sizes for the cars."
4,Does the job,"The scale has very easy to read numbers and looks good in the bathroom. Most important, it gives consistent readings. If you get on it several times in a row, you get the same result give or take 0.2 lbs."
3,good for removing paint scratch,"Takes some effort to rub if you want it to do its job on scratches. In cases where the scratch is not a scratch but the paint deposit from the other object, it does a decent job or removing it. Haven't tried it on swirl marks but I suppose it should do a good job there."
3,"Not bad, not great !","My cats scratched the hood of my Jeep so I decided to give good ol' Tutrle Wax a try. It covered 90% of the scratches and they are hard to see from a distance. The bad points are, you can still see the scratches up close and it brought out the pits where rocks have hit my hood, after 2 applications. I'm gonna try something else next time...any suggestions ?"
5,A work in progress,"This is a great book for getting to know yourself and your wants/needs/desires in a love relationship. It is a workbook, not just a good read. So, I'm still working through the exercises and enjoying them!"
3,Not very motivated!,"I'm a bad reader! I need a book that gets my attention 100% or I won't read it! I have tried to read this book, but somehow it can't get my attention! I don't feel motovated! The idea of doing it in a group made me feel alone! I want to do something for me and by me! I guess I'm not ready! I'll see how it goes after some time!"
5,how to,very pleased with this product that is nearly new and was shipped promptly and was was well packed so thanks
2,Not ready for undergraduate Students,"In general, if technical information about Psychological Testing is what you are looking for and you have completed a masters program, this text may be perfect for you. Even thought my exposure to this text was for a undergraduate college class. I found it very hard to follow and understand even after the 3rd reading. I found that the material in the text was very in-depth, but lacking chapter conclusions or summaries."
5,Anointed!,I have only heard the sample cuts - but it is clear that this sister is singing with a knowledge and an anointing. I am on my way to purchase it now - can't wait for snail mail!!!
2,Mostly good topics but not well described,"The book promises to cover many subjects in-depth. True, many subjects are covered - e.g. there is yet an other IP overview - but unfortunately I can't say the descriptions are very clear. The frequent use of acronyms, some of which were new to me even the subjects were familiar, doesn't make the reading any easier. I found the voice traffic modelling and delay simulation results interesting but I don't understand why to cover the complex mathematics so thoroughly when most of the book only skims the subjects. The reason why the human resources outsourcing via web was selected as a case study remains a mystery to me. The relatioship to Voice over IP is quite distant."
3,"Good starting point, provides map for future investigation",The book covered a wide range of related topics quite well. The mathematics was a little daunting. But overall the book presented the necessary information to allow you to grasp Voice over IP basics.
3,"Tools book, References book","I wanted to realize that VOIP Gateway and Gatekeeper,Bandwidth,calculation design or system planning."
4,A pleasure for short story readers!,"I don't know why Robert Louis Stevenson has been so long classified as a writer for teenagers. The stories included in this long forgotten collection are very entretaining and varied, and not at all for children. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did."
5,The best book on body language - no doubt,"I've read most of 'em and Body Language Secrets is the only book on body language I ever needed. I've found R. Don Steele's take on non-verbal communication to be accurate, entertaining, and VERY useful. Since I read this book, I cannot look at people in the same way again, especially in flirting/dating situations--the code has been de-coded for us by Mr. Steele. It's not only packed with valuable information, it's lots of fun to read--several times."
2,Crap dating book disguised as a body language guide,"Cheaper and better books exist elsewhere. Hell, ""Body Language For Dummies"" is better than this crap. At least it just focuses on body language. While Steele's observations are solid on body language, everything else is utter crap. So it just gets 2 stars."
4,A one of a kind book that everyone could learn something fro,"Not as good as the stellar How to Date Young Women by the same author, but a good read into a subject no one else is really discussing. Short, brief, and to the point, Body Language Secrets will leave some lasting and memorable tips for anybody who reads it."
2,Not good for newcomers,"This book is written in similar style as Optimal Control. For me it was very difficult to read, so I strongly don't recommend it as student's book. It might be useful as a refrence.For newcomers there are much better books, for example Dan Simon - Optimal State Estimation."
2,Disappointed,"Not being armed, Why? and I will repeat that. Why? would anyone walk into the bush for anything? I liked the show, right up until I saw the display of ignorance. Now,,,, I could care less! Step on land minds. Sink in the swamps. I know longer care. Your not aware enough to get out of your own way! I wish you guys the best, But doubt you are able. If people can take from you. They will. every time. Try selling health care. I hear there may be a market. May have to dig for the good parts."
4,A timeless adventure,"The Lion's Paw is a timeless adventure of children in south Florida. The books' main theme is to never give up, keep searching, and you will find what you are looking for. Not that the journey will be easy, but that the end result is worth the work."
5,Excellent,"This is the book that made me a life long reader. It is the first book that showed me that reading could be a real adventure, and made me start looking for other good books. My Grandfather gave it to me when I was about 10 in the early sixties. I would love to have a copy to give to my grandchildren. I too hope it is reprinted. 50 years later I still remember the story vividly."
3,light entertainment but nothing too special,"An ex-bomb squad copper, a few sticks of dynamite, a variety of seedy characters and some finely-tuned double crossing dominate this thinly plotted novel, but there really isn't anything all that explosive about this book. It's just a light, entertaining read about a few mildly dangerous, self-absorbed characters and the street-wise, mild mannered cop who's on their trail."
5,Just too damn good,"If you're looking for something to read in one sitting, this is it. Going on a trip? Long flight? This one is perfect. Going on a romantic getaway with that special someone? Forget it! They'll be jealous 'cause all your time will be spent on this book. If you like Leonard, you'll love this one. If you liked the movies ""get Shorty"" or ""Out of Sight"" and want to start reading some Leonard, here's a great place to start."
4,Has Some Nice Stuff,"It's a good idea - put out a release with interesting versions of songs, many from the band's early years, where the whole show won't ever be coming out for one reason or another.You get to hear some early Dead here, and it's generally enjoyable. You get a hard-rocking ""Hard to Handle"" that transcends in energy if not sound quality the other versions that I've heard. You get a very nice ""Visions of Johanna""."
3,Good Read,"#3 in Kahn's Rachel Gold series.The mystery is less interesting, more prosaic than that in the first two books. But it held my attention. Besides, I am primarily reading to spend time with Rachel, especially her hilarious interactions with Benny.Interesting note: The first book was set in Chicago. In #2, the heroine still lived there, but spent the entire time in St Louis (her hometown) on a case. I guess the author found that setting more interesting (I certainly do), because now Rachel lives back in St Louis full time. Good choice, I think.SPOILER: I do think the author has fallen into a weird recurring pattern with the heroine's love life. Here's hoping that is dropped for book #4."
1,I hated it!,"This book is firm proof that you can't judge a book by its cover. It has a very attractive cover. I hate the book. It is a legal mystery and I found that I did not care that the victim had been killed because he was immensely unlikeable, I did not care that any number of possible suspects had been falsely accused - they were unlikeable twits that deserved some trouble just for being so stupid. I did not like the lawyer (the main character) although I did like her mom.So, when the reader cares not about the murder, the victim or the suspects, he should stop reading, which I did after just 60 pages."
4,Good Deal!!,"This pendant is very pretty, it looks very believable! My only problem was it came with a regular chain instead of the ball chain as pictured. I still love it, it's a great pendant that looks like it should be worth more!!!"
4,Kept me awake all night.,"I believe this book is a contiuation of ""The Snow Leopard of Shanghai"". It is about a young girl growing up as the daughter of a counsel general. She travels from South Africa, to Paris, to England, to Switzerland, to Hong Kong. It was hard to put down. Now, I would like to read the Leopard of Shanghai."
4,A Gateway through Time,"Rice vividly gives us a taste of ancient Italy...alive with the painters and artists that made those times unique and beautiful. The book dazzles you as she uses her words to show you how it used to be in Italy. As for Vittorio, you will grow to love him, especially after reading his past and what he has been through. He is sort of like Louis, having humanity to him more so than the other vampires. Give it a try. I think it would have been more exciting with less descriptions and more action or weirdness, but it was good. I fairly enjoyed it, it was a tad bit better than Pandora."
2,This book was disapointing!,"Vittorio the Vampire read like a well written soap opera. Rice spent so much time describing how he became a Vampire that she forgot to tell us why we should care. The characters were not fully developed and it was hard to care whether they lived or died. The love story between Vittorio and Urcilla is completely unbelievable and fails to inspire.Overall, this book pales in comparison with her other Vampire and Witches chronicles."
2,Rice's New Novel Has Interesting Twist,"In her latest terrifying novel, Ann Rice writes about a vampire who thirsts for blood. He ends up killing many people and a few animals to quench his deadly thirst. For, you see, he is a vampire. As in her previous novels, the vampires in this story want to live eternally, so they keep killing people and sucking their blood to keep living. But this story has a startling twist which will enthrall the reader - this vampire is not named Lestat or some French sounding name. This vampire is named Vittorio, like an Italian.Bravo, Ann Rice. You are our Mistress of the Dark from New Orleans and one of the great literary giants in the history of humankind. Please keep giving us your wondrous books about vampires who suck people's blood."
2,Too much detail not enough action!,"Unfortunately, I like to read about characters and actions not long descriptives narratives about music, archecture, clothing, and soul searching. I miss Ms. Rice's Lestat-type writing style. It was witty, fast moving, and action packed. Her new books are a real disappointment."
2,So-So,"Does anybody else remember when Anne Rice wrote *stories*? Sigh. This was a book with nearly 300 pages of lush descriptions, occasionally interspersed with a little bit of action. [Nobody does lush like Rice, which is why I didn't give it one star.] Nonetheless, I found myself getting very bored. I didn't regret ending this book!"
4,I miss Lestat,"I liked this book a lot, but I did not like it as much as the books about Lestat. It is still definatley worth reading. I love her writing."
4,"more on the italian babe, please?","i was aware that none of the good ol' fav characters like lestat, armand and louis would be featured in the latest vampire novel...unfortunately, i still couldn't help but miss their presence.nevertheless, vittorio was a good read (much better than memnoch and body thief ANYTIME) and i hope rice will continue to write about his new vampiric adventures, or concentrate on ursula who wasn't given much of a character in the book, other than that of an innocent sweet young thing whose life was cruelly taken and ravished. would be interesting to hear her personal account of the horrific death-rape matrimonial consumation with florian and subsequent life as the vampire bride."
4,"Rich like velvet, thick like blood","Once again, Ms. Rice has captured a world 5 centuries in the past effortlessly. In Vittorio the Vampire, she brings alive the artistic and religious flavor of the time while still developing a richly drawn character. Vittorio pulses with a strong Italian blood and temperment, even after he is no longer filled with the blood of a living being. As with most, if not all, of Anne's books there is a love story that borders on tragic and a spiritual encounter that is not one that would be openly discussed with a priest of that time for fear of burning. This is a must read for any die-hard Anne Rice fan and for anyone who can appreciate fine literature and art. However, a quick(!) trip to an art museum might be required to fully grasp some images."
3,Better than I expected after Armand,"This book was refreshingly different after so many novels focusing on the one New Orleans coven of vampires. Vittorio tells his story well, despite Anne Rice's tendency to ramble.After the initial opening, however, the book goes downhill. Vittorio's love affair with Ursula is thoroughly unbelievable. He hardly knows the girl, but runs off like some melodrama hero to save the day.Ursula's character is nothing more than a shadow of Anne Rice's rich ability to present a character. Ursula is depressingly pale when put in comparison with Louis or Lestat."
3,Same formula... Why blame her?,"Although this is the best and most original of her latest couple of books (I could not finish Violin - it was so boring), it is still based on the same formula: very rich, extremely good looking, and incredibly charismatic charater becomes a vampire and confuses blood with sex, God, angels, the devil, and so on.I'm still waiting for Anne Rice to write ""Moshe"", the middle-class, balding Jewish vampire who lived in the suburbs, drove a Saturn, and worked in the insurance industry."
1,convert or entertain what is Mrs. Rice's goal at this point?,"Sadly, Vittorio The Vampire turned out to be another of Rice's smotheringly Christian novels. This time hidden behind the guise of a love for Italian art. Even I thought this one was too pious to be anything more than ennuyant & I can usually put up with just about all of her self righteous tripe to get to a good read. The morality she is gracelessly vomiting at her loyal readers has become all but intolerable to this reader. Will I personally purchase another piece of junk food litterateur by Mrs. Rice? Yeah probably but I never claimed I didn't have masochistic tendencies. Sometimes I think it's helpful to express a not so terribly positive view of things. In my honest opinion if I can save just one reader from the agonizing boredom caused by this book than I have done something pure & good."
2,Please...no more!,"That it I'm afraid. I'm finished with Anne Rice after following her since the first - there's only so much angst you can take before depression sets in.Anne Rice novels, the first Lestat books in particular, carried you along in wonderment at a new view of the world, but that wonder has grown stale and stagnant, and lanquid posing while waiting for the next sexual frisson does not, for me anyway, make for interesting reading.Wondering about your place in the world is all very well, but most of us grow out of it in our teens. Maybe that's why these Vampires do little more than gaze at their own navels - they are emotionally stunted.Too much new-gothic lounging and not enough plot."
3,lackluster at best,"Sorry folks! I owned this novel for a couple of years before reading. As a big fan of Anne Rice, particularly her Vampire Chronicles, I was disappointed in both Vittorio and Pandora. Both of these books felt more like they were written for Ms. Rice's fans and that she had lost her love of her Vamps..I give this tepid followup a mediocre review at best. Gone was my lust for losing myself in one of the usually most alluring authors I've read. Although still laced with beautiful descriptions, I couldn't fall into this one."
5,A wonderful look at religion and morals,I don't want to discuss much of the story so that I won't give it away. How ever not unlike most of her other books you will fall into her fantasy world full of vibrant images. I love the fact that Anne Rice has a way of showing us that we are all human. In this book even the priests are in bed with the devil as is the painter of heavenly images. When you return from the journey you will have a better understanding of humanity and our down falls.
2,Another disappointment for an avid fan,"Let me start off by saying I love Anne Rice's style. Her attention to detail creates an incredibly realistic sense of time and place and her ability to craft memorable characters makes many of her novels a joy to read. That said, this book flickers weakly with all the things I love about her novels but it falls short and was entirely in the end a disappointment. Her books of late, and Vittorio is no exception, are replacing creativity with self-indulgence and good old-fashioned story telling with religious pontification.Read it if you must (it was better than Violin at least) but skipping it would be no great loss."
2,Not one of her best...to say the least,"I have read every single one of Anne Rice's books and thoroughly enjoyed each one but this one left a lot to be desired. Her other books are filled with passion and mysticism and they have the ability to transport you into the characters' lives. This book however, did nothing of the sort. In the beginning, it seemed very promising but it then it dragged on and on. Anne was certainly descriptive and attempted to infuse passion, mystery and compassion into the story but it didn't seem to work. But, all the same, I can't wait for her next book! Please read Pandora and Armand - they are truly Anne Rice masterpieces."
3,"I enjoyed the book, with reservations...","I think that Anne Rice is a very misunderstood author. Her works explore things she's interested in on a personal level, which doesn't always appeal to her readers, who in turn get angry because a book isn't what they expected. Ms. Rice states right out in the beginning of the book that _Vittorio_ is not about the vampires with which we are so familiar. Instead, I believe she continues to explore her understanding of the spark of the divine in us all. This does not have the same lushness of _Interview_, or _Lestat_, or the witch series, or _Belinda_, or _Cry to Heaven_, nor quite the same erotic qualities, and I felt a little cheated because of that. It is, however, a good read, evoking wonderful pictures of the Italian hill cities and Renaissance Florence."
1,I love Anne Rice but...,I've read all of the Vampire Chronicles and found most of them very enjoyable. But this book was soooo boring and long winded. I had to force myself to finish. Her last two books Pandora and Armand were readable but definately not her best work. The storylines for all three books were kind of boring. But this by far is her worst book. I wish she'd continue with the Mummy Story. Her Witches were my favorite. Sorry Anne this one wasn't very good at all.
4,"Entertaining, descriptively wonderful!","I've enjoyed all of Anne Rice's novels and this one is definitely worth reading. The wonderful descriptions of Italy and the character of Vittorio leaves you pained by his circumstances of family honour, being a saviour/redeemer and in the end succumbs to his passion for an immortal woman. The granduer and horrors of the Court of the Ruby Grail was quite unique compared to the other Vampire Books. However, I was mystified by the ending...it left me no closure and a little puzzled."
4,a Zippo worth buying,"A durable and fun zippo lighter! My first zippo, of many to come, and I love it.The shell is the normal zippo brass with an enjoyable sprayed on crackle finish. It's extremely durable, I don't smoke but I can always find something every day to light. And the only time this guy has ever let me down is when I use up the fuel.Now my second favorite lighter it's still the one anyone can put in their pocket or take anywhere and not need to worry about scratching or destroying its looks. My first fav. lighter and more of a pure class is the Armor Polished Brass Zippo,http://www.amazon.com/Zippo-169-Polish-Brass-Armor/dp/B0007RTGDI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1335409476&sr;=8-1Cons: the only one is the hinge its able to wiggle the top cap back and forth, but only when its open, and then you have to examine it closely and look from the side. So its nothing anyone would notice.Buy a Zippo, they're amzing lighters, reliable durable, awesome and just plain sexy."
2,"Bought it, returned it","This scale, like the other tanita scales that purport to measure body fat, apparently do it by way of calculating the information that you input - THAT'S IT! The idea that the scale is sending electricity through your system to check your body fat does not pan out if you do a simple test: - input your info, get on the scale, and see what percentage of body fat you've got. Now get off the scale, get a heavy weight, (like 3 gallons of water), input your info same as before, and get on the scale. Voila! Your body fat percentage is now higher, not due to extra fat but the extra weight which the scale calculates out to a percentage. In my opinion, not worth a dime for fat percentages."
3,Ultimate in name only,"This scale is one of the low-end scale/body fat scales. It does not maintain any data - i.e. you have to reinput your height each time. You input type - adult/child, gender - female/male, and then push the button multiple times to input your height (unless you're 3' 6"" - which is where the measurement starts). Then you step on and it shows your weight, and then after 5 seconds, it shows your body fat. For me, the measurement seems off - I've tried it at different times of day, and it fluctuates by 1 percent, but overall it seems too high. It is consistent, so that would be useful to document fat loss, but it's accuracy (for me)is suspect.I will probably return this for a refund after another week. Too much button pushing for my liking."
2,Good information.,"This book contains good informaton, but horrible writing makes it difficult to understand. I would suggest reading another book on the subject before attempting to decipher this one."
3,Helpful Guide,"I found the book helpful, but not as detailed on the nuts and bolts as NASDAQ level 2 trading guide by the Trading Acadademy or as wide ranging and easy to read and apply ""Trading Online"" by Patel."
1,Not for the new guy,"Being new to trading I knew I had to get an education. I picked the wrong school. I found it very confusing and it didn't give me any useful tools to start trading with. The author may be good at math but he's a lousy teacher. One big ad for Datek, which has received some terrible reviews lately. Don't waste your money."
1,"Poorly Written,Badly organized",This book was a major disappointment.The authors write in a confusing way about trading issues that are never fully explained.Not nearly as good as the Patel book.
1,A mediocre overview of the direct online trading systems.,"A slim overview lacking the detailed understanding and assessment of market making strategies, individual stock gyrations, and obvious broker dealer advantages. Sounds more like an infomercial to sell the authors' (ie George West and Mark Freedfertig)trading sysytem to inexperienced investors. Additionally , for the money , one of the most poorly written pieces of literature ever published under the fine auspices of McGraw-Hill."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Having purchased ""The Electronic Day Trader"", I had high hopes of learning how to become a day trader. I was utterly disappointed. My criticism of this book is made up of the following points: 1. The book is not well written. In many instances, the explanations given by the authors are unclear and downright confusing. 2. No usable trading methods or techniques are described in the book. Even if I was to attempt to trade electronically, I would have no idea whatsoever on the how-to of choosing what to buy and sell, when to buy/sell it, at what price, etc. 3. Descriptions of what market makers and their ilk do are so simplistic as to be useless. 4. No real life examples of trading are given to help clarify what the authors are talking about. 5. The only decent portion of the book talks about the different systems available to trade electronically. Even this portion of the book is hurt by being poorly written. In short, don't buy this book! END"
3,I wanted it to be better,"After carefully reading The Electronic Daytrader, I feel like I'm still not ready to start. The book's first 2/3rds explain general market practises, and only the last 1/3rd talk about Daytrading."
1,Over Hyped,There are much better day trading books available than this one.Totally over-rated and under performing!
3,For Day Traders Only,"Somehow I had the impression this book would be helpful to experienced investors with thoughts of learning how to day trade from home. Bad idea. The book went into way too much detail and depth with regard to esoteric day trading topics that are inappropriate for anyone who does not have access to Type II quotes. The book most definitely convinced me that I don't want anything to do with day trading. So from that perspective it was a good book. I suppose it makes a good ""text book"" for day traders. But I have a strong impression that the book will put aggressive investors into the ""danger zone"" of thinking they know what they're doing when in fact they do not."
5,Good book for starting day trader,"I liked the early history in the book. Too much jargon. You need to read this book several times to understand what to do. Particularly after you've lost money trading. Then this books starts to make more sense. However, I found the chapter on random markets so difficult that I skip through it. Are there any pictures that would explain the numbers? Does anyone understand that chapter? The tables in the back are invaluable in trading groups of stocks that move together. When I see one move I quickly look up the others and see if the group is starting to move and has relative strength versus the S&P500 and then I enter my trade. This has worked quite well. However what does that chapter on random markets mean? It's driving me mad. I can't figure it out. Yet."
1,"If you want to be a day trader, don't buy this book.","Perhaps 4% of this book will be useful if you want to become a daytrader. There is plenty of padding, and background information on how the exchanges work. But if you want to know what a daytrader should do from the moment he awakes till the market closes at 4pm, this book doesn't give you much of a clue. If the authors know anything, they're not passing it on. Can I have a refund?"
1,Lobster Crackers-Lousy Vendor,I tried to cancel the order as i needed the items for a huge party we were having and when it was obvious they were'nt going to be here on time. I received an immediate response from the vendor that they were already shipped but I could return them after they were received. Guess what I returned the items and my credit card has still not been credited. I checked the postal confirmation and the vendor still hasn't picked up the box. I am not happy. The crackers would have been perfect for the party but didn't come in time!!
5,off da hook,"yo dis is da best mc out there. he disses puff y so dat is good and people who dont like it, like that chickenhead from minnesota dont know real hip hop!"
1,Load of old tosh!,"May i plead you reading this to not buy this album. I must confess that i have lied in my rating and my title for this review. It is a clever ploy to make u not want to buy this record. Why? i hear you cry? well the story goes...Please don't buy this record as i want to keep it to myself like an old secret only i know about. No one i know has heard of Willy Mason and it makes me feel all buttery inside knowing this and knowing he is all mine to keep and this record is my little secret bundle of joy. Everytime i hear his 'is that a guitar or a machine gun' on Our Town i crack a secret smile no one else understands. Please if you MUST buy this record do try and keep it secret and never let it leave your tight grasp. I love you Mr. Mason. Monsieur Mason , je t'adore! plese be mine forever and ever. I love you all"
5,Simply Beautiful,"Both Shange and Nelson are at their best in this beautifully illustrated walk through African American history. The illustrations are wonderful and the poetry is, in fact, poetry. Lovely."
3,This product caused such a burning to my ...,"This product caused such a burning to my skin that I couldn't use it. In fairness to the product, I do tend to have sensitive skin at times, so it might not be that way for others. I still would recommend it."
1,Justify the cost,This product is $12 in the manufacturer's mail order catalog and $16 on this web site. How do you justify the Value Added by Amazon?
5,It works. Period.,"What's to say? It's cheap, has no bells or whistles, is NOT oily or greasy and it works as advertised. I have calluses (did I spell that right?) on big toes and heels with DEEP fissures. Deep enough to become a health hazard. Poured Porter's (an alliteration for a skin product?) onto my toes and heel, put on socks and went on my way. I'd repeat this at night and again cover with socks.I saw improvement in two days and now, a month later, there's NO improvement because there's nothing TO improve. The calluses are all gone.I'd say ""Thank you Porter"" but he's dead.Oh, about the smell. Everything I've read alluded to it without describing it. Stop reading if you, too, wish to be surprised.Still here? One of the ingredients is ""something ammonium"" There's a hint of camphor and ammonia when first applied but the odder is slight and goes away almost immediately"
1,Not All That It Claims,"I have sufferedfor the last year of dry, peeling, cracked finger tips and hoping Porters Original Lotion would work. I does not. It smells like a pharmacy and does very little to add relieve. I have been using it about 4 times a day without success."
3,WOW found it!!,"Hadnt seen it since on TV as a kid. I remember this being much scarier than it is... still, a good watch."
4,"Great book, for a specific audience","This book is very clear and easy to read and is very well pitched for the new project manager. It is specifically targeted at people who work in organisations that don't produce software as a product, i.e. people in corporate IT departments, because a lot of the book is about analysing and gathering information, in a way you just can't do if you're tendering for work. It assumes you have a large and well-funded team (e.g. 4 developers, 3 testers, a technical author, etc.), but I think a lot of the advice would be equally applicable in smaller teams (e.g. the different roles you need to fulfill). It's lightly written with plenty of humour."
2,rivalry jacket,"This jacket was not sized as advertised. I returned this item because it was too small, even though I ordered my normal size."
2,Title was misleading to me,"I was under the impression the book was going to show me how to use rectangles or another technique to make the triangles. I was wrong. It has only little squares. If you are into checkerboards, this one's for you. If you are have never quilted before, this one's for you. If you have no imagination, you guessed it - THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!!!"
2,disappointed,"journey inwards is a an amazing album with the perfect melody to do exactly that but this album unfortunately does not make it, thought I would love it because all these reviews were so positive but bukem takes nice tracks and beats and lays them all over this monotonous and mostly too fast background... kind of irritating actually because you want to hear the music and are constantly bombarded with rapid machine gun fire."
4,A Good Fit,These shades fold into very compact sizes that fit into the pouch behind the front passenger seat. The metal bands that form their edges can be pressed into the creases between the windshield or rear window and the ceiling of the passenger compartment to keep them in place. They cover the windshield or rear window almost completely. They're the best sunshades I've ever seen.
2,ok,Product is made of very thin material. Multiple pin holes which I think will keep the product from lasting.
1,Not Happy with this product,"I am very disappointed with this product for following reasons:(1) It is not easy to fold up as described. In fact it took me over 10 minutes to get it to fold up. I can figure out how to take apart a three ring puzzle in less time. So if you are not good with your handles do not buy this.(2) When I hold the shade up against the sun, I can slightly see through it. I am not sure how it can block the sun out.(3) The description says it fits any size car. Well it did not fit my Honda Accord. Amazon should have put the sizing guide (lists models and years) on the product description page."
5,"The first, and in many ways, still the best","I first read this book in a psychopathology class; it has always stayed in my mind. Everyone should read it. The author's defining characteristics of the psychopath are still as relevant today as they were over 50 years ago: the psychopath (today usually called an ""anti-social personality"") is much like a gourd; there's an outside (the ""mask of sanity""), but inside there's nothing there. No conscience, no guilt, no remorse. They're great actors, though. In their more disturbed forms they're the serial killers, such as Ted Bundy. Cleckley suspected these people were literally monsters, lacking whatever made them human. A must-read for those involved in law enforcement."
1,"Don't be fooled, these are cheap for a reason","I thought I would get these and save a few bucks over the $100-$200 stud and cuff-link sets. I should have known you get what you pay for.These were so bad I had to return them. The metal setting was all chipped and scarred on the studs, and the black stones on the cuff-links were too small and off-center. These studs and cuff-links are obviously cut-rate and very poorly made.I can't recommend these to anyone."
2,This book was horrible,"This book was horrible. This book has a lot of high level information but does not show you how to do it. If you want to develop something once you are finished reading this book, forget about it. I've read chapters over and over and still didn't understand what the author was referring to. There are very few examples to walk you through creating things. When there are examples, they reference stuff you were supposed to create in a previous section, but there were no examples in that section."
3,One Dove - White Love,"One Dove's biggest hit, WHITE LOVE, gets loved and re-loved by Andrew Weatherall, who put his production stamp essentially on the entire album. His love of dub is clearly evident through all the mixes. But that's a bit of a drawback, since the mixes don't differ from each other that much. Sure, the ""Guitar Paradise"" mix has added drone and reverb, but is it enough? The ""Meets the Professionals"" mix takes out the vocals, except for Dot Allison's background singing -- but a little more variation would have been welcome."
2,not great,"the light is very weak, not nearly as bright as i thought it would be and the coil part doesn't stand up on its own like the picture shows. i have to make sure its propped up against something. i was very disappointed and will not order one of these again."
4,Let there be Light,This is a great help for when I travel; I don't bother anyone with overhead lights and it is so Malleable - move it to wherever you need it...Great Investment.
4,I like it!,"Easy to useVery accurate (unfortunately some days)Large, easy to read numbersOnly negative was Expensive, but if it lasts, it will be worth it."
5,Love this scale!,This high capacity scale is really nice. It can memorize up to 5 different weights/people. And Amazon's price beat the competitors by about $15 plus I saved the shipping costs.
5,The best I've ever owned,"This scale is very accurate (it gives the same weight as my doctor's scale...unfortunately, lol)Because of the low profile it is easier to get onto the scale with my bad knees and the larger size (13 1/2"" wide and 15"" long) means that I don't have to do a balancing act while trying to weigh myself. And, unlike other scales I've owned, I don't have to stand in exactly the same place everytime to get the correct reading.Buy this scale, you won't be sorry."
4,"nice look into early, early Dead","I think the first disc of this two CD set is worth three stars. It has an amazing version of ""That's It For The Other One"" and a fair version of one of my favorites with ""Doin' That Rag"". However, I'm sorry but I think their attempt at ""Hey Jude"" is pretty bad. However, disc two deserves five stars. The late show begins with ""Dupree's Diamond Blues"", trips into ""Mountains of the Moon"", dances into ""Dark Star"" and rocks straight through ""St. Stephen"". It concludes with a beautiful version of ""We Bid You Goodnight"". One complaint is that at the very end of this CD, we are teased into believing that we're about to hear an encore of ""Cosmic Charlie"", but the song is crudely killed in the middle. The sound quality on this isn't as good as some others, but considering it's from 1969... It kind of has a bootleg feel to it. Plus imaging being there, at the legendary ""Fillmore East"", waiting to see Janis Joplin, kind of adds something to it."
1,Only 5 songs,"When I read the description where it listed songs, I thought those were just examples. I didn't realize that was the entirety of the book. Five songs is far fewer than one would expect from a book of vocal selections from a musical, especially with a musical such as this one that has such a rich selection of songs to choose from."
5,The shifting sands of Alzheimer's,"This is a tremendously important book about one family's experience with the surreal and shifting landscape of Alzheimer's. Eleanor Cooney's story will break your heart, but also thoroughly celebrates the life of her exceptional mother, Mary Durant: a mother, writer, lover, and adventurer who manages to retain a spark of the dynamo she was up until the very last chapter.Cooney's memoir takes a hard look at what it means to have Alzheimer's in ""real world"" America--with limited money, family caregivers, and no media attention or public support. Not surprisingly, there is much room for improvement. Addressing caregiver fatigue and providing affordable, quality long-term care placement for those with Alzheimer's needs to be be near the top of the list of our country's health care priorities. I would recommend this book for all medical and assistive personnel working with the elderly."
3,Redeemed,"After receiving the wrong color, they exchanged my watch for the desired color without any problem or extra charge.That's good service...thanks."
1,False advertising.,"Ordered ""Assorted Colors"" thinking it was what was pictured- many bands- but no. It's just one. A purple one. Awesome.Not to mention the watch comes activated which means my battery life is already drained."
2,"Poor quality, possibly old stock","I was very disappointed in this perfume oil. Thankfully I did not purchase it as a gift, because the bottle it came in is not the bottle pictured here. Due to poor packaging, the outside of it was sticky and the cheap label was covered in oil. The oil itself is very thick and sticky, like diluted sap and the best way to describe the scent is a very weak Egyptian musk and cardboard. I am thinking it maybe is old stock, but I have another brand that is several years old and still smells great. Even though it was inexpensive, it is not worth the loss of even a few dollars. I would not recommend this. Pay more somewhere else for better quality. I used to get the Kareem Abdul brand for $5.99 for a 1/2 oz back in the day and now I see it listed for around $16.00, but it is the best version out there that I have tried and 1000 times better than this."
5,Book of Faith,"I enjoyed reading this book, and it has truly helped me understand some of the things that I went through while dealing with the loss of a loved one. Thank you Mrs Monroe for sharing your life experiences with the world. I admire your strength and I hope God continues to bless you and your family. This is a MUST READ for anyone who has been through a spiritual struggle. In reference to the first reviewer, I don't recall any mention of Mrs Monroe's husband leaving her ""with burdens of debt"". Did we read the same book?"
3,Didn't realize I had selected 3D,"This is a childhood movie that scared me to death. I was looking so forward to watching it, but even though it says you can watch it on a regular tv, I couldn't. I wish I had paid more attention and not ordered 3D. Otherwise, the movie is awesome!"
3,form+function.. kinda,"i thought it would be clear and when it arrived it was neon green. it works... I don't know if it's the pencil I put in it or the sharpener, but the tip keeps coming off and sticking inside it. annoying.... it's just an okay buy. there are sure better options elsewhere. i guess i really give it a 3 and 1/2 stars. You're probably better off buying something else. The novelty to it isn't much."
2,Home Inspection Business From A to Z (CD),"I'm in agreement with other readers who have mentioned that the CD is a pain to deal with... and I'm an Information Technology Director! After seceral days of working through email, with the manufacturer, I was finally able to get the proper authorization string which would allow me to open the product. After that, I discovered that this product (a PDF file) was NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PRINTED. Ultimately, this means that you need to sit in front of your computer the entire time you're reading the material - NOT a preferred situation!The manufacturer mentions through email, that ""for an additional fee, you can get the printable version"", and they offer a link to their web site.Forget it!"
4,Change the Game book review,"Overall I thought the book Change the Game was pretty good. One of the things I liked most about the book was that Grant never talked about all the money he made. I also liked how Grant expressed his feelings about problems kids face today. However, one thing I didn't like about the book was it was sort of short. Grant also moved from one topic to the next very quickly. Other than those things the book was good."
3,How Sweet It Is [LIVE],"Frankly, I was expecting a higher recording quality in the HDCD format. Sounds look it was recorded from the audience, almost bootleg. If your a hardcore fan, I would be disappointed."
5,A New Classic,Guaranteed: you will not be dissappointed with this music. All the musicians on the CD are exceptional and allow Jerry to shine. The organ in particular is exceptional. Enjoy!
3,"Baby, Secret of the Lost Legend","I really enjoy the movie, but disappointed it was not releasedin wide screen , the way it was filmed."
4,Enjoyable Adventure film which not for Very Young.,"When a Couple of Adventurious People (William Katt & Sean Young) have discover of a family of Brontosauri. But when an evil man (Patrick Mc Goohan) tries to make money out of this Discovery.Directed by B.W.L. Norton (More American Graffiti), this film offers more than a cute fable. The Film Violence and a Hint of Sex represent Disney`s attempt to appeal to a wider audience. The Real Scene Stealers is the film`s Special Effetcs of the Ancient Critters make the show worth watching. Sadly the DVD is not on Widescreen Super Techniscope (2.35:1) format. Grade:B+."
5,Mylenium Tour on DVD,"Get the Mylenium concert on DVD! It exceeded all my expectations! Truly a treat for a music fan. Amazing and unforgettable performance by Mylene. Spectacular dancers (most of them are from Broadway), costumes, decorations and the songs are just beyond belief. I am convinced now MF is most talented pop female vocalist of this century. Her lyrics and music mesmerize audiences no matter what language you speak (watch audience singing and crying with her!).Being also a Madonna fan, I can tell you that her Drowned World show is just a far cry from what French star has to offer (no wonder, many of her fans in Europe were disappointed). Too bad Mylene Farmer is not known here, in the U.S.Watch it (if you lucky to get DVD), listen to it. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Simplement magnifique.,"I have read the review of a woman saying that this album is the worst Mylene has ever made. That is simply not having an open mind for something different.That person is wrong because all of Mylene's albums have been great! I am french and I know that she stands as one of the most beautiful voices in the french musical directory. Her stage acting is awesome and her character is unmatchable.This album is quite different from her previous ones but everyone has the right to change and it doesn't have to please everyone.I believe that if you have a bad taste for music, there is no need to share it with everyone.I recommend to get this album simply because it's part of her comeback. And if you don't like it (which i don't think will happen) simply return it and case closed..."
1,Mylene's Worst album: Terrible!,"I discovered French artist mylene farmer with ""Anamorphosée"", a very impressive album then decided to buy her other Cd's. Sure, her voice isn't very beautiful or original but her atmospheres are intense and sometimes gorgeous. ""Mylenium Tour"" Is terrible except ""Rever"", ""Maman a tort"" (1minute) and ""Desenchantee"". The rest is pure garbage. The woman can't sing Live. Some songs are play-back and the recording is awful. My husband, who usually bears her music told me she sounded like an animal. Don't waste your money and skip this one...."
5,This Is A Great Watch!,"I have this watch over 6 months now and I love it. It is a nice and heavy watch but that just show you the quality it was put to create it. One plus feature I love so much was the Kinetic unlike regular automatic watches where the rechargeable cell battery will store energy up to 6 months. Overall, this is my first Seiko watch and I love it!"
4,Worked well for carpet,"I bought some new carpet for an acura that was grey and spray painted it black. worked well. I just painted small areas at a time and rubbed it in immediately with a stiff carpet brush. This stuff dries really quick, but it was 102 degrees outside. I was a little worried spray painting $400 worth of new carpet, but it worked better than I thought it would. The carpet felt pretty much the same after I was done painting it. I also painted a couple trim parts, that didn't turn out quite as well. the paint ""spatters"" out of the nozzle randomly. I would recommend several VERY light coats for plastic trim. Again, it was also 102 degrees out side and it says on the can not to use it above 90 degrees, maybe that was why. Would've been 5 stars, but i wasn't impressed with the trim pieces. I'll post an update it this stuff ends up wearing off or sucking."
1,not very goodlooking babes for T&A,"Dona Speir looks tough and unpleasant, like she's been out in the hot sun way too many years, and of her co-stars only Cynthia Brimhall has any appeal and we don't see enough of her. The Sidaris formula is worn out."
1,No other choice,poor program. Lots of bugs and errors. Little to no product support. Replaced with new version every two years and old version is not compatable with new files every couple of updates. It is an industry standard with no other viable option however.
2,Not As Effective As Proactiv,"This product did not work as well for me as Proactiv. The cleanser does not do a great job of exfoliating, and the toner was a bit harsh. It also dried my skin out pretty badly. I will not purchase this system again."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have been using proactive for 5 years and decided I waqs tired of spending $46 every ten weeks. Anways,I have been using the Klear Action for about 2 weeks and I immediately broke out. The face wash doesn't have the little crystals in it, which I actually prefer because the crystals in Proactive is a little harsher on my skin then I would like however, I am willing to deal with that as long as I am not breaking out. I am going back to Proactive."
3,ok for price,nice and cheap. did not clear up all acne. big pimples are hard to clear up with this treatment
4,Great mixes - I want to go clubbin'!,This is a great CD. Pete Tong does a fantastic job of mixing classics with new grooves in a way that keeps your body movin'. I highly recommend it.
4,The Sacred Review,"This book is excellent---more gripping than Mrs. Kellerman's first book in the series, ""The Ritual Bath."" The novel further delves into the lives of Rina and her sons while Decker is out trying to solve a multiple murder case in the porn film industy. I was disappointed in the scene when Rina and Decker consummate their love for the first time. First, it totally doesn't fit Rina's character to show up at Peter's house saying, ""I want to sleep with you."" Also, I feel like if they were going to do it, then the scene and the one following it should have been more dramatic. Kellerman missed an opportunity to write a beautiful scene and comment on Decker's feelings afterward. Withstanding that, this book is really excellent! Read it!"
1,A Young Woman's Perspective,"Some of my girlfriends at my college mentioned reading this book for a good laugh!Mr. Steele states that ""... most beautiful women are plastic and shallow. They are no fun as human beings because they are empty shells..."" This is NOT the attitude that a man has when he is successful with beautiful women.Mr. Steele's bitter attitude toward beautiful young women is a reflection of his own lack of success with them. I would NOT recommend his book to any man that's interested in dating beautiful women. I'd be willing to bet that the women that Mr. Steele did date were fat, and unattractive."
1,Worthless.,"This is pretty much a collection of letters his fans have sent in. His response to their questions is always the same: read my other books, buy my tapes (cassette tapes, really?), come to my workshops.Really disappointing."
5,As it is equal to or better than the first edition,"I purchased How to date young women after working in an office with young chicks and wanted to understand their attitudes way of thinking and found that book truthful, straight to the point and amusing.Which is why I purchased this book to help me learn somemore I was hoping for the same straight down the line real world talk and I wasn't disappointed, this book Don has taken the best of letters written to him on the topic and helped the reader understand some more, from their own experiences, misunderstandings or mess ups."
5,Advice for dating women of ANY age.,"In addition to providing up-to-date information about dating on his new radio show, R. Don Steele provides more than the basics to dating women in this book. This book covers skills beyond those found in his first book. He goes into more depth about meeting and dating women. He also describes how to identify women with emotional problems and how to use the phone effectively when talking with women."
4,Smooth jazz for troubled times & troubled souls,"I am revising my earlier review and upgrading my rating because this is ""what the doctor ordered"" for those people who enjoy Kenny G and his genre. I don't recommend it for the ""purist"" jazz listener or the musicologist; I do recommend it for those who like their music jazz tinged, mellow, and soothing.Anyway, to look at this album, it seems more diversified to me than others I have heard. On the most romantic side, there's ""Forever in Love"", and ""Sentimental"". There are the vocals by Peabo Bryson and Aaron Neville which are nicely backed by Kenny G. Unlike many instrumentlists, he never tries to take the song away from the vocalist, but rather backs the singer, and adds a little embellishment.This isn't the greatest CD, but it will please the ladies Kenny woos, and all those with an emotional sensitivity, while it irritates his detractors. And what's wrong with diversity of musical tastes?"
4,His last good album,"I recently bought this album for [$$$] last week and was pretty anxious to listen to it. I was surprised to hear songs such as ""forever in love"" and ""by the time this night is over"" which are songs played on lite rock and smooth jazz stations. His sax playing just blew me away and almost made me fall asleep. I love his backround keyboard music it sounds so much better than his recent albums. I heard other songs such as ""the joy of life"" ""sentimental"" and ""G-bop"" which are only played on smooth jazz radio stations and they sounded wonderful. Why couldn't he keep this same style? His albums. ""the moment"" and his most recent album ""Paradise"" simply lost their touches. His album ""The moment"" has hardly any keyboards and sounds almost like an alternative/90's soft rock record, and his Paradise album sounds like music that can be recorded in a lounge. Sad to say that after this album I too had to step off the Kenny G elevator"
1,Take your own advice,"Breathless? If you were, you wouldn't play. Certainly that would be a favor to us all. Sure, we'd have nothing to listen to while we are shopping for shoes to wear to the gathering at the country club, or to play as background music while we entertain pretentious guests at our mansions. But hey, I think we'll survive. After all, there is this style of music we call ""jazz,"" which is actually quite wonderful to listen to.Face it, Kenny G fans. You don't have a clue what you are talking about. His music doesn't relax you; it numbs your minds. It is bland candy that places no demands on the listener. Quit wasting your time and minds. He is an insult to every worthy musician on this planet."
1,Elevator Muzak,"This is not jazz, but that doesn't matter. I like jazz, but I also like many other kinds of music.The point is, Kenny's music is all the same. There is no creativity whatsoever, it is completely thoughtless and always on automatic."
1,Crappppppppppppppppyyyyyyyyyyyy!,"If you buy this Cd Ia advise you to either: A.burn it B.burn it C. burn it D.see if you can get your money back , otherwise burn it."
1,Not Jazz!!!!!!!!! Not romance either!!!!!!!,"Typical ""G"" on this one folks. Out of tune, horrid tone, and weak musicianship. Now the first thing people are going to say is that Im just a jealous jazz purist, that I should not compare him to the likes of John Coltrane. Well G fans, we're not. We're holding him responsible for carrying on the tradition of the saxophone since he's(for some odd reason) is so popular. But he hasn't. Yet people claim he's the best ever. Coltranes album ""My favorite things"", or ""Coltrane for lovers"" is much better. It has the lyricism that people claim to hear on this album, and he has a better tone. Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" is a great album if you're looking for something ""Romantic"" This album, however, quit kidding yourselves. Don't buy the name, buy the music."
2,It is what it is,"I purchased these for my kids to color/read in bed. The bins on the side are a great feature. They hold books, pens, actually can hold quite a bit of stuff. It is not as strong as it looks and bows when items are too heavy. You cannot choose colors and I received two red ones, which makes it difficult to differentiate users. Nothing a Sharpie can cure. When I was making the bed one day, the sheets were covering the unit, my son stepped on it. It cracked, bowed and basically was a goner. He did not like the red anyways."
4,Not one of the best books but still good.,I love John Marsden that I try to read everything of his. This one is no exception. It is very well written and you get into the story really quickly. The problem is the backflashes. I could never tell when they ended and where she is now. If you are a fan of John Marsden READ this book.
4,Pretty solid collection.,"Ah, my favorite DD tunes-takes me back to adolesence. DD owned much of the radio in the early to mid 80's. This is a pretty solid collection of their best plus a few newer tunes that are really good. If you don't have any of their stuff this is a good place to start. Otherwise forget it. I hate remixes and this has a good number of them tacked onto the end..."
4,Excellent Duran Duran,"I like Duran Duran and thusly I really like this album. If you are a fan of their music, no matter if it is the old stuff or the new stuff, you will like this album. Great for any fan of 80s music."
3,80'sgulity pleasure,"Recently looking through my mum's crazy cd collection i found this i thought isn'nt this one of her obsessions as a teenager so i thought let's listen to it. There i found loads of catchy pop tunes in a sleazy 80's coperate way. If you like 80's synth-pop you will love this especially tuns like 'rio', 'hungry like the wolf' and many more but be warned the 86-89 is awful but they retrurn with a good 1993 tune called 'ordinary world'. Overall a good collection of songs."
4,A fun CD.,"Its very important that music from the 80s bring out memories and this certainly does. The last track, Come Undone, can have such an effect on my memory, it takes me back to times I miss. If you're the same as me then this CD has the two or three Duran Duran songs you're really looking for, and without having to buy more than one disc, with the US single version (the version you used to hear on MTV) of Ordinary World and Come Undone. Drive around and listen to this one, its a keeper, and a good buy for an 80s/early 90s music fan."
5,A great collection of Duran Durans Finest Songs,This album is great if you like one or all of Duran Durans songs. My personal favorites are Ordinary World and View to a Kill. Worth every cent!
2,"5-star songs, 2-star collection","All of Duran Duran's greatest songs on one disc? Great idea. Too bad it's impossible to accomplish with an 80-minute time limit. In this attempt to do it, several of the band's best works were left off, including ""Careless Memories,"" ""Too Much Information,"" and the brilliant ""The Chauffer."" Several of the tracks are also edited versions of the originals, and poor edits at that. There are several import collections that represent Duran Duran's work much better than this. Hopefully a 2-cd set or a multi-CD box set will eventually be available here in the US."
1,NOTORIOUSLY AWFUL,THIS SUBPAR COMPILATION SOUNDS MORE LIKE A COLLECTION OF WORST SONGS TO ME.SONGS LIKE HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF AND VIOLENCE OF SUMMER SOUND STALE AND DATED.DONT TOUCH THIS WITH A HUNDRED FOOT POLE.RATING 0/10.
2,Don't trust it!,"I got this thing about 2 years ago or so. I just took it off today because I can't really read the screen. Some of the lines that create the numbers no longer work. It's never been all that great. I got a NEW Interstate battery put in my truck and the thing is telling me I have 50% or so battery life left. Some mornings I'll come out to my truck and the thing is beeping like the battery is low. It's a nice Idea, but really cheaply made and the readings it's telling you, you can't trust!"
2,Nice Idea But.....,"I thought this meter would be a great way to avoid the surprise of being stranded by a dead battery.The Battery Bug looks like it knows what is doing. The voltage indicated seems accurate. However, when my batterywas so worn down that I couldn't leave the ignition on for more than 15 minutes without needing a jump to start my car,the Bug still reported battery health at 65%. This makes the main function of the device useless.Guess I will have to go backto preventative replacement of my battery every 2 or 3 years.Easy John"
4,Argus Battery Bug Review,"The argus bb-sbm12 battery monitor is all any do it your self person needs to tell if the car battery is getting weak, after a few weeks of mointoring the battery, it showed that my battery was at 28%, and the weak battery icon can on, even after recharging the old battery the percent reading remained below 30%. The battery was four years old, and I believe it would still last another year, but I didn't want to do a count down to 10% before replacing the battery, so I replaced it. The new replacement battery is holding at 70%, with tempertures running below 30 degrees during start-up in the morning. Over all this battery bug is all you need for checking you car and truck battery."
1,Blade did not fit original equipment wiper,"Based on the amazon.com information, the PIAA 94055 22"" and PIAA 94065 26"" were ordered as wiper blade refills for my original equipment wipers on my Honda 2008 Civic LX.Unfortunately, both blades were too narrow to fit securely in the wiper arms. The wipers expect 10mm wide blades, and these were 6mm and 8mm wide. The length was NOT a problem.So both blades were returned for amazon credit.If amazon have provided ACCURATE information on the blade width, the blades would have never been ordered. The parts ""wizard"" that claimed the blades would work for my vehicles was also inaccurate.Unless amazon changes their information about the blades, Make SURE you know the blades will fit BEFORE ordering.A 1-star rating had to be given due to the amazon issue, not because of the actual product.PIAA 94055 Silicone Wiper Blade Refill - 22"""
1,wrong bin??,"I also got a 24 and 22 inch blade, and the 22 inch is not correct width. I tried to use them, and now breaking since do not fit correctly, or the 22 inch length one is. Now must buy again just a few months later."
5,one of my all-time favorites,"This is my favorite of the single Tingstad & Rumbel recordings. Medicine Tree in particular is intriguing and different, very eerie and evocative. Hanging in Babylon is also very memorable. So many acoustic new age compositions sound remarkably alike, but T&R compose very unique, individual music. Every piece has its own voice. All the pieces on this recording were inspired by some type of garden, and the music definitely projects the right images. I had never thought of ocarina as a particularly attractive musical instrument, but in Rumbel's hands, it goes right to the soul, as does her use of oboe. Tingstad is one of the best new age guitarists, if not the best, and between the two of them, Tingstad and Rumbel always pick the best voice for the musical image they want to project. Highly recommended for lovers of instrumental music."
4,gigli: from earliest to middle period,"Romophone has maintained its excellent standard of transfers with this double album of recs that begin in 1918. A friend of mine says Gigli's tone was the most ""seductive"" of all tenors, about which I would have difficulty arguing. The later electrics show the bad side to Gigli's singing, with aspirates at every turn; unnecessary with his abilities and a disgraceful indulgence. However, most folk will not be concerned, concentrating on the honest upfront outpouring. Recommended to newcomers to Gigli as a good cross-section; most fans will already have the contents (though unlikely to be in such balanced transfers)."
3,disappointed no dvd,"I guess I misread the ad. I thought the bonus cd was the video version of the ""One Night Only"" concert. Very disappointed even as good as the music is."
4,Incredibly good.,"All I can say is that this album is excellent. Casual fans may be tempted to get their 2-disc ""Greatest Hits"", which is also amazing, but this 24 track live disc is just as great. Song after song is just classic, and newcomers will probably be suprised by how many hits these guys had. Included is ""Stayin' Alive"", ""To Love Somebody"", ""Tragedy"", and even ""Grease"". Plus ""Islands In The Stream"", and my favorite ""(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away"". This is a perfect example of quality and quantity together in one collection, and it's all live in Las Vegas too. It's a must for any level of fan."
2,"Same stuff, different decade.","For years the Bee Gees have complained that they were unfairly portrayed as ""just a disco band."" How ironic, then, that they should open and close this concert set with ""You Should Be Dancing,"" the most blatantly disco song they ever recorded. Most of the rest of the time, they're singing hits from the 1960s and '70s (as they do in every friggin' concert), with only a couple of songs from their latest album, ""Still Waters."" The Bee Gees recorded some of their finest songs in the 1980s and early '90s (""You Win Again,"" ""E.S.P.,"" ""One,"" ""Ordinary Lives,"" ""The Only Love,"" ""Paying the Price of Love,"" etc.), but you won't find any of them here. On their albums, the Bee Gees have left disco in the dust, but on stage, they still seem to be suffering from ""Saturday Night Fever."""
4,songs from Grease,"I ordered the songs from Grease cd as a gift for my Granddaughter who has just discovered the musical and loves it. The ad for the cd clearly states that it is the cast of the London stage production of the show, therefore, there was no confusion as to who would be performing the tunes. The quality of the cd as well as the quality of the performances is excellent. My eight year old, music loving, hyper-critical Granddaughter loves it. Life is good."
1,What a terrible movie!,"Don't bother! I am a huge fan of both Stephen Dorff's and Gabrielle Anwar's. But this movie has almost no redeeming qualities. The plot is weak, although at times it shows the potential of some depth. The characters are unbelievable. You have no idea about anyone's motivation... even after the movie has ended. And it is VERY poorly acted. Dorff delivers THE WORST performance of his career. He should have had an accent coach, because his accent was so spotty that I was left wondering whether he was the child that was sent off to America instead of Anwar. I could go on and on about this movie, scene by painful scene, but what's the point. Hardly anyone can find a copy of it, and out of those almost no one watches it. Well, don't break ranks on this one. It's simply not worth it."
4,Small and works,"Works great in European vehicles to get rid of some unwanted noise in aftermarket audio systems. Would be nice to have a bit better bracket system ( perhaps side mount) and slightly larger terminals. For us guys in the shops fabricating something or adding a couple washes is not a problem, but for the weekend guys wrenching on their cars it might require a trip to the store."
2,There must be something better,"This video is really only for people just starting out. If you can link turns, don't bother. The information is very basic, the production value is low and the pace is almost painfully slow. The instructor uses a ""graphpaper progression"" to demonstrate concepts with the snow boarding action figure. They are simple line drawings and the on-screen writing is very difficult to read. This approach seems a poor choice, or at least poorly executed way, to demonstrate the concepts. But, if you're looking for drills to get your foundation and improve your comfort on the hill, it might be worth a look."
4,Self-Help on the Hurry Up,I was skeptical when I read the book but when I put the author's suggestions into practice I found it to be a great experience. As an added bonus I got to enjoy some movies that I never would have watched otherwise. The key is to follow the author's suggestions about how to use the movies in one's healing process and not just watch the movie(s). I highly recommend the book particularly for those who want to explore relationship issues.
4,exploring our inner selves through film,"Many counselors and therapists may informally make use of movies to help people explore important psychological issues. ""The Motion Picture Prescription"" lists ""200 Movies to Help You Heal Life's Problems"", as the subtitle puts it, with brief synopses of the films, short lists of ""healing themes"" in them, and comments about the key story elements.For example, Solomon writes about ""Rain Man"" (with Dustin Hoffman as the autistic savant brother to Tom Cruise, unknown to him for decades): ""Some families keep secrets that eventually come to light, leaving those who are still alive to deal with the legacy of the family lies. There's no room for secrets in a loving relationship... Can you see Charlie [Cruise] was taking his anger out on Raymond [Hoffman] when he was really feeling hurt and sad over his father's abandoning him?""Also included is a chapter with specific, usually common-sense suggestions, and an index of the 200 films in various theme categories."
1,Never received item. Terrible customer service.,"I never received the item I ordered. I've emailed the seller three times and have never heard back. Not receiving the merchandise is maddening enough, but not getting a response from the seller makes it even worse. They're confirming that they couldn't care less."
1,INFERIOR PRODUCT,"I bought this for my toddler and it was awful! First, the solution spills if you don't keep the Gazzler straight (which makes no sense if it's a toy for a child). Secondly, the toy itself stop working (broke) after a week (Used only twice, for not more than 30 min total)... Not worth the money at all!"
4,As Advertised,"Exactly as advertised. Ordered on Sunday, got it Wednesday. Excellent condition for used. Price about the same as school bookstrore."
1,Cannot fix it !,"I bought one of these about a year ago. Did everything I wanted and expected it to do. One minor complaint was it is rather heavy, BUT WORSE NOW is I cannot get a new cable ass'y for this model as it is no longer available. The unit is rendered useless without that cable. The plug in end always seems a bit flimsy, so I always kept it a separate bag rather than have it stick out and get bumped. It finally fell apart and ALL black and decker places have this cable labeled unavailable/ no longer being manufactured no replacement. I just ordered a new model (JUS500IB) with attached and different cables, but if they are just as weak as my old one, it is going back. I wish B&D would make good on this as I deal with Amazon reasonably often and it makes them look bad. Sorry but that is what happened to me."
2,Probably not what you're looking for,This device will be likely be less than what you need. My hope was to use it for camping. The fact is that it discharges quickly while not in use. So mostly it is an expensive rechargeable flashlight.I would not count on it to start a car.
3,BACKUP BATTERY,Not great for accesories or household items. Will jump a car.Takes forever to charge and doenst seem to hold a charge for long.
1,"Good idea, poor execution","The air compressor nozzle broke the second time I tried to use it. I was just blowing up bike tires. Shoddy quality.The spotlight is not very bright. You could read a book with it, you couldn't light up an engine while fixing it at the side of the road a night.The AC power worked alright to run a lamp when we lost power for a couple hours last summer."
1,does not come with a cord to CHARGE this thing.,"Was very disappointed, it does NOT come with the attachment to CHARGE THE STUPID THING. ALSO, you cannot even use a computer cord extension because it won't fit. So you have to go buy something else just so you can use this thing. Someone should have mentioned this. Now you guys know and won't be as pissed as I am when you realize you have to buy a cord."
1,"DON""T BUY BLACK AND DECKER","Nice unit, nice features - BUT no parts or service is available.After a few years of very light household duty, the air impeller on this model failed. After two year warranty expires, B&D; offers NO customer service except to offer to sell you a new unit.If you are content with a two year lifecycle - buy it. If you think you getting a premium product from a company that cares about customer service, you will be as disappointed as I am.Note the positive reviews tend to be from new owners. I felt the same way when the product was new. But the quality isn't there over time, nor is customer service."
5,Works as advertised,Only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump. Otherwise I'm very pleased with this product.
3,Short Battery Life,"I received this model as a gift for Christmas 07. It did in fact save me one morning from a dead battery. That was the first and only time I used it for that purpose. The next time I tried using it, the battery was totally dead.. So dead it wouldn't power the LED lights on the front. It sat in the garage plugged in the whole time. Whether this was a bad idea or not, I don't know.The compressor worked decently for topping off tires. I just (today) purchased a replacement internal battery from zbattery dot com for over $70 after shipping. I was half tempted to just replace this, but thirty bucks is thirty bucks. And if you do have to replace the battery, the innards of this thing are a booger to get to. More screws and wires than I expected."
5,Boot Scootin Boogie.,"Brooks And Dunn Are The Duo Of The 1990'S. This Is The Debeut Album. Their First Single Off Of This Album Is The Title Track. This Album Also Features The Number 1 Hits, ""My Next Broken Heart"", ""Neon Moon"", The Dance Hit ""Boot Scootin Boogie"", And The Top Ten Single ""Lost And Found"". This CD Buy. These Songs Are Also Featured On The ""Greatest Hits"" Album."
5,Great moisturizer,My daughter suffers from dry toes and at times the skin cracks open very painful. I rub aquaphor on her feet very night and put on cotton socks within a week her toes healed and now they are baby soft. I started applying it on her face as well since her cheeks are always dry and red now they are soft and healthy pink.
5,"The Fortunes , Singles",This is a terrific CD. It dives into all of the Fortunes best songs. You won't be disappointed in this purchase.
5,Annihilation of time and other concepts,"Rebecca Solnit has created a provocative masterpiece! This is not a simple biography about one of the great innovators of the field of photography. It is a richly, intellectually layered work that explores the big ideas of time and our relationship to it; the fusion of politics, science and industry in the 19th century; and links today's Silicon West to what we call the Wild West of our past. She possesses exceptional writing skills. This is book well worth reading by those seeking inspiration to invent the future, or for those who wish insight into the concept of progress."
5,My Favorite color!,"I have several of the Bebe Au Lait nursing covers. This one is my favorit color because it is not as noticable and does not scream ""look at me!"" The Bebe Au Lait nursing covers rock! I love that I can see my baby hands-free because of the boning in the neckline, and the terry cloth in the corner is great for wiping up any little messes! I bought mine at Little Dudes and Divas! They have super fast shipping and their customer service is number one!"
2,needs an editor,"Unfortunately, this book was not the useful reference that I had hoped. The writing style and presentation of information are very disorganized at all levels, with many sections, subsections, paragraphs, and sentences that are out of place with respect to the topic under discussion. The first chapter is a (not so) great example. The same information may be repeated in multiple chapters. When I tried to refer back to a particular subsection or table, I found the desired passage to be very difficult to locate because it could have been in a chapter with an unrelated heading. A better Table of Contents is needed. There are typos and grammatical/punctuation errors throughout. The book needs very much the help of a professional editor. Lastly, the pages started to separate from the binding before I had even finished reading the book!"
5,This is a great book!!,I have used my Secrets to a Successful Greenhouse Business to decide whatkind of greenhouse to start my business. This book is extremely extensivewhen it comes to information. It is obvious that the author has built hisshare of greenhouses. I reccomend this book for anyone who is going into thefarming business or even if it's just a hobby this book is wonderful.
4,Anecdotal Discussion of Parasitology,"This is a quick read understandable to anyone who has taken college biology. Desowitz's presentation is primarily anecdotal this makes for quick reading, but also whets the appetite for more information. I recommend ""Yellow Fever, Black Goddess : The Coevolution of People and Plagues"" by Chrisopher Wills for a more in-depth and contemporary discussion of mosquito-borne parasites and the evolution of disease."
4,The Like has a lot to like,"I saw these girls opening for Muse this fall, and while I should mention that I'm the kind of guy who gets easily bored with opening acts, I have to say that I was quite entertained by them. The Like might be compared to girl bands like The Donnas, but while The Donnas seem to play the same old punk riffs, The Like seems to have more substance and the songs sound non-repetitive. Some few tracks sound a bit bland, but nonetheless The Like seems very promising. I had the chance to meet them after the show and they were incredibly nice. Sadly they were sold-out of albums because I really wanted to signed copy.I'm looking forward for their next work"
4,Worth it!,"One of the best in ""The Masterpices"" series. Many of the discs (the symphonies in particular) were licensed from Nimbus and other full-line labels. Not all that long ago these discs would have set you back $18 to $20 a piece. That said, I still wouldn't part with my Hyperion collection. 40 CD's at this price... you can't go wrong."
1,Will not buy this,I can't see D965 or D945 on this 40 disks worth of Schubert. Bizarre! There are so many great songs missing it scares me.
5,Miles's best album ever.,"Milestones was always an underrated effort in my mind. We all know it was a classic, but Kind Of Blue was really known as Miles's classic album and jazz's classic album as well. Well, Milestones is a great album, too, and Miles comes better on this one on my mind. He does a great arrangement of that stupid song that you probably had to sing in preschool, ""Billy Boy"". Miles doesn't play on that one, but ""Straight, No Chaser"", is incredible. So is ""Miles"" and ""Sid's Ahead"", which are great Miles performances. You must have this soulful swinging album!"
2,Art of South American Cookery,"I found some of the recipes that I am familiar with very poor and inaccurate. I will not recomend this book at all.I am not returning the book because it cost me more to return it, than to get back what I pay for it."
5,Gift for Mom,I got this book for my Mom so she could learn some spanish cooking for my Husband and his family. I haven't heard any feedback on the recipes but my husband seemed to like the looks of them. The delivery was great and on time as usual:)
5,Awesome for diaper rash,My son has had an awful diaper rash/yeast infection for over a month. This has helped clear it up and ease his pain. I recommend it for everyone!!!
4,A very good read,"I read this book after seeing the movie because I'm an Oliver Reed fan, like so many books, the movie version is so different. But I still enjoyed reading this book, written a long time ago (for me) some parts were quite difficult to read in this drama about a group of assassins who are payed to kill their leader, the film continues in a chase to find the member of the bureau who would kill Dragomiloff the leader, or to see if he successfully managed to eliminate all of them. Seeing the film first, I do prefer the film but still find this a very enjoyable read."
4,"Good in many ways, but contains errors","While this book was helpful in my AP Biology class, we spent many periods debating over how to interpret certain diagrams, only to find out that the reason it was so hard to understand was because the diagram itself was badly drawn. Some are more complicated or more simple than they need to be, one or two are just wrong. However, I highly recommend this book to anyone who learns well by the written word rather than by pictures."
5,Great collection.,"This is a great collection of recordings by famous performers and licensed from a number of great classical record companies. And all housed in a convenient box that's only about as big as 11 or 12 standard CDs. It's a great way to explore beyond the ""standard"" Dvorak works, and he wrote so much great music it's a shame that only a little of his output is standard. I have no complaints about either the sound or the performances, and I feel this is a great overview of Dvorak's music and performances, both famous and less well known, through recorded history."
2,Economy = cheap,"I didn't get this from Amazon, it came with an aquarium I was given. The hole provided for the filter is MUCH too large and I've lost a snail that found the opening. The bulbs are constantly burning out, the bulb covers just don't protect them enough."
2,Nice and light,It's a nice light cover with a good size feeder opening and a few knockouts in the back for tank accessories. It's inexpensive and sleek. I couldn't give it a 5* since this is a replacement. The lights to my previous cover fell out. The metal sleeves that hold the bulbs in fell out. But at ~$20 lasting a few years isn't too bad.UPDATE: I hate this thing. This one broke after a few months with the same results. The pieces that the bulb screws into broke off. I trashed the lid and won't be buying this type ever again.
1,RATTLING is driving me crazy!,"I have my 10 gallon aquarium set up with a new filter and this new hood, and for a few days I thought it was my filter making that TERRIBLE grating rattling noise. It turns out it's the hood, my filter just hums and bubbles. I tried everything to fix it, replacing light bulbs and tightening screws, but NOTHING would make it stop. I'll have to buy a new one, my fish tank is right by my bed!"
4,absolutely wonderful,"if you love broadway, you'll love this cd. great to dance around the house and do house-work to. keeps your toes tapping."
4,"Exciting, true story of a little girl's life","This novel explains what's it's like for a little girl to grow up. I suggest anyone to read this novel. It's heart touching, emotional story. I couldn't put it down, I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Believe when I say this story is one you'll never forget."
4,Delivery took awhile,"Perhaps I was spoiled after receiving my first order so quickly. However, the book was in decent condition and it was delivered before I truly needed it for class. Thank you."
4,"They work,.",But they are a bit cheap in construction. Would not expect to use them with any frequency without having some wear trouble.
5,Works for me every time.,"I bought these before reading the bad reviews... so I was a bit surprised to see that they did get a bad review... I have used these about 15-20 times in the last three years, and they have never failed me. You do have to read the instructions though - make sure you connect the cables up to the dead car first, then connect to the live car... check for two green lights and rev the engine on the live car.If you only get one green or no green, try again. I usually have the live car running before I connect the cables up, but have done it with the engine stopped - works either way for me.Length of cables is good, quality seems fine - the teeth on the clamps are flexible enough to fit top and side mount battery posts, but depending on how your battery is mounted, it could be a bit of a squeeze to fit the handle of the clamp on a side mount post.All in all, I can't find any fault with them."
5,Amazing Wiper Blade!,"You'll be surprised how much better Silicone wipers work. No more skipping, squeaking, or streaking. They also seem to handle snow and ice better than traditional rubber wipers. The extra cost paid off in the first week, just due to less aggravation on rainy days. I'll never go back to rubber wiper blades."
4,Excellent Portable Crate,"I looked a what seems to be hundreds of portable crates and by far the quality of this crate was outstanding. Easy to set up, easy to take down and store. Very sturdy materials used throughout crate. The PVC Mesh Screened Windows are the best feature.Great air ventilation, studry flaps for sleeping, pockets for storage, everything I need."
2,Not satusfaied with product.,I have Rhodesian ridegbacks. I have purchased this item twice. Every time they have bent the door opening so then it sags on top. The supports are not strong at all. I could see if my dog was a huge dog but they are not that big yet just a nudge with the nose they bend it all up. I like the convenience of being simple to put up. I show my dogs so it makes it nice for shows. However now having a sagging top they don't want to get in it. They need to find a way to make it sturdier.
3,Large Breed Dog Owners Beware,"I used this crate twice and, on the second time, my 60lb black russian terrier puppy snapped a vertical support rod on the front of the crate. The crate now sags and is unusable. Since it is past the return time to send to Amazon, I called Midwest (the manufacturer) for an exchange.I also purchased a smaller version of this crate for my pembroke corgi and have had no issues with the crate. I have used it many times for agility trials with no issues."
1,False Advertisement,"This RV cover (#75563) is advertised for all 5th Wheel trailers of a certain length range. That is the only restriction listed. The instructions shipped with the cover state that it should not be used on RV's with a rubber roof (Note; most RV roofs are now covered by a rubber membrane). If you do, the warranty is voided. This fact must be declared by Amazon or they shall be responsible for the stated warranty."
4,Be careful with the size.,"I purchased the deluxe 33' - 37' for our 35' 5th wheel and it is about a foot to short on the sides and in the front so it doesn't fit the camper as shown in the picture. If you have a tall 5th wheel you need to keep this in mind. We have a Colorado by Dutchman. It seems to be well made and we put it on because it is to late to try and return and try a different size before winter. We have had some strong winds and it seems to be ok, moved a little but we will see. The price was great and free shipping is awesome but really wish I would have ordered it sooner so I could have returned and tried to find one the correct length for the side and front to back. As for the cover itself it is very nicely made. Time will tell if it will last another year."
1,TURN IT OFF!,"ok, the first album by THE LUNIZ- Operation Stakola, was the BOMB! but what on earth happened to Yukmouth? on this album, he has the most annoying voice i have ever heard, and all he does is scream, it really sounds sickening. he needs to tone his voice back down to a decent level, call Knumskull & beg to get back as a group, get off RAP-A-LOT, and make some more good old fashioned LUNIZ music! (but LUNIZ second album-Lunitic Muzik was awful too). i USED to ""have 5 on the LUNIZ"", but i ain't got NUTTIN on Yukmouth as a solo artist!"
5,What's Cooking? American Mosaic,"This indie-style film should be a Thanksgiving season classic deserving of wider recognition. The diverse ensemble cast really nails the family tensions -- and love, hopes and dreams -- that simmer and boil over during holiday reunions. Yet in the end the ingredients feed our souls."
4,What's Cooking,"What's Cooking is a film that the whole family can enjoy. Well written, acted and directed the film tells the story of four family's of different ethnic backgrounds getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Featuring an all star cast featuring Joan Chen, Julianna Margulies, Mercedes Ruehl, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard and A. Martinez to name a few. Written & Directed by Gurinder Chadha and produced by Jeffrey Taylor, Ethan Hurt and Steven D. Kravitz for Because Entertainment the film skillfully weaves together a story that is both interesting and entertaining. I would highly recommend this film to anybody that enjoys the cinema but is put off by the vulgarity in so many of today's films."
2,Very Over Priced,"this culling of information is one is a series of bio-bibliographies of many personalities by virtually unknown 'writers' who have taken indivduals and then catalogued the events of their lives. It's not really writing, is just cooelating and, at that, there are glaring omissions and inaccuracries. Finally, however, its the general price of these books that is rather outrageous. Over priced."
3,An undiscoverd classic of trash fiction,"Oh yes, this book is trash. It's vile, and at times silly. But if you like this kind of thing, it's pure gold. With an insightful screenwriter and director, it could be a great movie. However, it's more likely to go straight to video if it would ever be made at all. But the book... well, if trash is your guilty pleasure then you have hit the jackpot."
5,Genius of America is exactly that..........Genius,"This is the best CD I have purchased in 10 years. Gary's solo (I think) at the end of ""Arms of the Enemy"" is so fitting....what a way to close the song out! ""Say What You Will"" huge! ""Fish House"" has drumming by Prairie like ""Think About Me"" on CBP. ""Fastest Gun Alive"" has a deep powerful groove, massive feel; just an explosive song. ""Who Named the Hurricanes is like ""Wild Women of Wongo"" revisited. The CD is full of variety and mix of styles which can only be accomplished by very skilled musicians. The final cut is a spectacular display of creativity .....giving me the sense of 90's Hendrix feel. I would like to stress the creativity again and again. I too, am adicted to the Tubes of the past, but give this CD some room. You've gotta trust your ears with this one, but for me is was breath of fresh air."
3,Reads to much like a text book!,"The author did a great deal of research and tells of a horrific tale, but tells it in away I had High School(from history class) flash backs. The book is full of interesting history facts, but I was more interested into the actual ""Bell Witch"", not the history of the town, now granted that is important to have a basis of the book, but where was the thrill, the spine tingling chill? I read it in one day because it was a very good book, but it is not a scary ""GHOST"" book, in that I was disapointed."
1,don't waste your money!,If you want to read this book just get yourself a Bible. I don't have any problem with people's religion but he put more line from the bible then anything he wrote. Not worth the cost.
2,Over valued,The information was good but a little dated and length of the DVD way too short to warrant the price. Disappointing.
2,Not like their other books...,"I loaned this book to a friend. He came back to me with: ""lord, this book is so bad!""I said: ""I know.""He said: ""Why didn't you warn me?""I said: ""Well, it could be subjective, and I didn't want to ruin it for you in case you liked it.""Anyway, I know KJ Anderson is a good writer. And I'm a big fan of Hubbard's Battlefield Earth and Mission Earth books. I just didn't like this one."
1,Ai Ronito! When your intelligence goes wrong!,"This book is on the level of a pre-teenie comic book without the cartoons. It is so stupid, that one wonders why Ron Hubbard needed a co-author: to make the book, or to take the blame? If they just labelled it as pre-teenie material per se, like the Hardy Boys, maybe it wouldn't get such a terrible review from me. But this example of vanity publishing by the super rich Hubbard, using his own publishing house, offers it dead pan to all, in competition with writers like Tom Wolfe and Tom Clancy. Forget it. At local bookstores it's discounted 50% and still they can't give it away. WASPs never are exact doubles for Roman Catholic Cubans, by the way. Lame."
3,What I wanted,"I only purchased this cd for ""Take It Like A Man"". Other songs we're just fine though too!"
5,The best,This woman has soul and I love every tune. I missed place this one while on vacation last year and it is not easy to find. I found it here.
4,What a glimpse...,"Both the text and the images in this book are priceless -- the photos of the actual sketchbooks of Van Gogh evoke a feeling that right here, inside these small books, is a map of the process of an artistic genius. The end section that shows some of the sketches next to finished works is a great illustration of that exact process.The essays and description of the reconstruction of these sketchbooks was both interesting and scholarly. Good reference for art historians and artists alike."
2,Dreamland - Michael Junior,The orchestra managed to drown out the voice of Michael Junior. I bought the CD because I saw a program on PBS which I thought was excellant. Although it has beautiful music I would have preferred to hear the voice of Michael Junior to a greater degree.
5,Best Gift,"I've bought five Dreamland CD's for gifts this past year and everyone I've given it to has raved about it. The last song, ""Friends"" is absolutely beautiful and I play it almost every day. A real day brightener!!! ============="
3,a pretty good book for pre-meds,"I think this is a good book for anyone interested in pursuing a career in medicine. The first half of the book (which takes place in medical school) is quite interesting as the reader gets a glimpse into the mind of the medical student and all the emotions she is feeling. The stories of patients that the author remembers are captivating. However, I found the second half of the book (which takes place during the author's residency) somewhat skewed as the author chose only to mention the worst cases she encountered. Also the chapters in the second half are short and the stories seem less complete, leaving the reader hanging at times."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"We made the mistake of purchasing these sliding switches for almost every room of our house. The plastic sliding knobs have broken or cracked on nearly every switch. When paying high dollar prices, I expect quality. Hunter has really disappointed me with this item. I have looked and asked for replacement knobs in every store and online and have had no luck. Seems like Hunter may have put themselves in a position to at least sell replacement knobs, but they have failed me again. I wouldn't buy these again, and I would never recommend them. Look for a sturdier quality switch."
4,If you get one Ken Boothe CD...,"I'd say this is the one to get. ""Freedom Street"" is one of the most passionate rocksteady classics I've ever heard. Boothe is more famous for a kind of sappy lovers style. That stuff is OK, but nothing compared to when Ken cranks up and belts out, ""Then take off these chains, from off our feet!"" The rest of this CD couldn't possibly measure up, but it's mostly in a rougher style than his other albums. If you're a rocksteady fan, this is what you're looking for from Ken Boothe."
3,It's all right,"I heard that this band was opening for Covenant in L.A., so I picked up the CD to see what they were all about.If you like goth-ish synth pop, then this is your CD. It is definitely that.It's not a bad CD. I could see how, if you were into this music, you would really like it. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the CD had anything new to offer me that I hadn't heard before. Also, it didn't quite have the strength I was looking for. If you like the lighter side of goth (such as New Order and Erasure), well...I think those bands do it better. If you're looking for more music that sound like those bands, then you probably won't be disappointed by this CD.I will say, the sound is NOT dark, and the music is NOT industrial (whatever you take that to mean). Most of it is actually quite happy and uplifting. The lyrics on the other hand..."
4,Delightful,"This rather short movie is a delightful watch, though I would've liked to have seen more of the characters. Morgan Freeman plays an actor who hasn't played in a movie for a while and is 'researching' a possible role in an Indie film when he runs into a young girl in the 'ten items or less' lane in a grocery store. Vega's character has lots of spunk, but faltering confidence that she can strive to be more. I love the banter between Paz Vega and Freeman, as well as the other unique characters.Chrissy K.

4,A sweet fairy tale,"After passing this film up many times on cable I finally just let it play when it came on and, wow, was I surprised. Sure, this is no slice of reality, but it is a sweet reflection of what may happen once in a while. Morgan Freeman plays his charming self and I hope to see Paz Vega in more films. A couple of other things: this was made really and truly on location. LA is filmed in LA. Brentwood is filmed in Brentwood. Carson is really Carson. For once filmmakers do not assume that no one from the place in question is ever going to see their movie. I'm a Morgan Freeman fan to start with, but after this like him even more."
