3,It's all relative,"You know, if you're in need of a brown dress shoe but don't have a lot of money then these shoes will work for you. The heal of mine wore out and I won't spend the money to have them replaced, as I'm looking to upgrade the quality."
3,15 well-written short stories about the strange & mysterious,"Arthur Conan Doyle is most famous for his stories about Sherlock Holmes, however he wrote numerous other short stories and novels. The Best Supernatural Tales of Arthur Conan Doyle collects 15 of his better occult/supernatural stories. If you're not used to 19th century English as the British used to speak it you may find it a little slow going, however it's still quite good and I think you should give it a try. It is interesting to note that Doyle's writing style seems VERY similar to H.P. Lovecraft's. Since Doyle was already dead by the time Lovecraft began writing I can only surmise that Lovecraft learned something from reading Doyle's works. If you're a fan of Lovecraft I can safely say you'll like this book. If you don't like Lovecraft than you should probably spend your money on something else."
1,Too cheap,"Bought 2 of these 75 to 300 ohm matching transformers. One arrived with a completely rusted terminal connection to one wire. Both units were unusable for me as I needed to screw a connection onto the threaded end. The unit was so cheap that the threads and threaded end were made too small and a threaded coax would not hold. It might work for someone who wanted to use a push-on connector. Too much trouble to return, will throw away."
1,no way jose,"is this a 5 star film. there's plenty of reviews already so no point in going over the plot. but sheesh, special (sickbag) mention to the scene where our previously blind heroine is all upset because she can't play with the blind music group anymore. i mean really. so this downside compared to the upside of she can actually see again is supposed to be a highly emotive scene. it's like your friend who has just won millions in the lottery turning up on your doorstep and crying about all the problems they've now got since they became rich. boo hoo. oh and another thing. you get a donation of a body part but the donor's identity must be kept secret? really, why would that be?"
3,"Ok, If you like horror, you might as well watch it","OK movie but like so many Asia movies (Suicide Club,Inner Senses), the stories are great but they end up going nowhere, they give you extra characters and facts that have nothing to do with the end result and sometimes even contradict the story. I must admit, I did jump a couple of times but foreign films also don't capture the moment by increasing the volume of the special effects for that added chill.Disclaimer: I'm using the same review for Inner SensesRent-YesBuy-Maybe"
1,Very Disappointed,"I tried to use this Sangean U3 radio for one year. The base sound was so boomy that the talk radio that I listen to is unintelligible. I keep a radio with me outdoors where I spend many hours gardening and landscaping on the 8 acres surrounding my house. I used a Dewalt worksite for the prior 4 years and took a chance that the Sangean would be a good update. I was wrong. The price was good, $129 when I bought but the thing takes 6 large batteries so I paid another $110 to get 8 rechargeables and an automatic charging unit. The sound quality is horrible.This week I gave up on it and ordered the latest version of the Dewalt with an 18 volt battery for $168. The Dewalt recharges in one hour and the charge lasts much longer that the batteries in the Sangean."
2,second-rate film noir,"Elsewhere in this space I have noted my love for film noir. The black and white photography, the story lines and the sparse and functional language. However, not all film noir is created equal and that is the case here. Robert Mitchum along with Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas and Orson Welles were the masters of this genre. However this one falls flat as Mitchum plays an old-fashioned steady reliable no-nonsense cop untainted by the corrupt public officials around him. Robert Ryan as an old fashioned small time crime boss who is not hip to the new ways of doing criminal business is a wooden stereotype, as are his henchmen.The plot, such as it is, revolves around the tension between these old foes. If you want to see Mitchum when he reached for the noir stars see Out Of The Past. Then you will know what I mean when I say not all film noir is created equal."
4,Deadly Details,"Garth Ennis' re-examination of the murder of Frank Castle's family contains chilling new details. The shock and trauma of his family's end really underline Frank Castle's fanatical anti-Mafia jihad.Lewis LaRosa's art is sketchy and free flowing and works well with the paint quality coloring. The Punisher is so hardcore in wiping out Mafiosi that you almost feel sorry for them.Interestingly, although it's not explored in detail, there is a small boy who is apparently a relative of some of the Mafia. This child eyewitnesses Castle's killing spree.It's an interesting inversion of Frank's witnessing of his family's deaths. Now, a child of a Mafiosi sees his loved ones gunned down by Frank's bullets.Could this be a Mafia version of the Punisher?The second story arc, ""Kitchen Irish"", is a nice take on the IRA and the artwork is much more of a realistic style than Larosa's. It's enjoyable but the end is kind of predictable."
4,Brief and concise summary of her career,"I loved this DVD. It shows Selena`s career very well.It is a must for any Selena`s fan and a nice recommendation for anyone who wants to learn about Selena, her life, music and relevance for latin music."
4,Super Cute,"Not sure I like kitties in the evil role, but they are more likely to try and over throw the world :-) Cute movie"
3,Good but not wonderful,"I am a huge Scarlett fan so I rented this DVD as soon as it was released. I am dissapointed to say that she was not her best in this film. Topher Grace, however, does deliver a good performance. Overall, this film was good but not what I expected it to be. I would recommened anyone to rent this film but not to base Scarlett Johansen's acting skills on this performance alone."
2,Two stars for trying,"Hats off for taking on the human aspects of the shark-infested waters of today's business ethics.Gloves down for only coaxing mildly adequate performances, for failing to project the slightest idea of what professional sales is all about, for concocting several totally unrealistic scenes (e.g., Malcolm MacDowell's absurd inaction when his keynote speech is artificially interrupted by Quaid), and for creating a very pale imitation of ""The Graduate,"" with cross-generational dymanics, secret affairs of dubious morality, and Simon-and-Garfunkle-like songs in the soundtrack.But then, would the film had been produced had the screenplay been more critical of today's business practices, and bit the hands of those financing it? No way!Go see ""The Corporation"" instead, and get a better picture."
3,"it's ok, not as good as the critics sponsored","a light weight screenplay with weak storylines. okay performance. the whole sports magazine company looked pretty staged and fake, full of cardboard one-dimensional supporting figures garbaged in, garbaged out, then garbaged in again. a lukewarm comedy like a half baked potato, half ediable, half got to be thrown away. the ending even sucks more and bigger. before completely took off, suddenly lost headwind and got to glide down with no-big-deal crash landing. a so-so directed job, only survived by dennis quaid's die-hard endevor."
4,Perfect...Until the End,"This movie had everything going for it. Dennis Quaid is what he is best, a quirky dad confused at life. Topher Grace shines as the best new thing in comedy. Even Scarlett Johanssan, better known for her more serious roles like ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"" enters the comedy world beautifully. The movie glides along perfectly, the jokes are funny, and the chemistry between Topher and Scarlett is completly believeable. Then the movie ends. Viewers sit in their seats, staring at the screen wondering if the flim is having technical difficulties. The movie leave its audience with no conclusion. The driving romantic plot, around which the whole movie revolves, is never resolved. This movie is classified as a romantic comedy, which means that people go expecting a happy and satisfying ending. This movie dissappoints in only that area, which unfortunatly, is the most important area of all."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzz...............wake me when it is over.,"An old guy gets a young boss that fires lots of people and then sleeps with the old guy's daughter. The old guy and young boss start out hating each other, but become good friends in the end. Predictably boring.Yes, the movie captures the cold heartless nature of corporate american, but so what? We all know that corporations suck, I don't need to see a movie about it. 2 stars."
1,"Weak character development combined with slow slow moving ""plot"".","This movie has no plot and moves (when it moves) painfully slowly.If this is romantic I'd hate to see their version of Cinderella. Summed up, this movie's message is ""nothing is guaranteed and do what you want and if you don't know what that is then go for a run on the beach."" The actress reveals the philosophy when she expresses dismay by saying she has been cursed with a stable family.I found myself fast forwarding through scenes just to get on with the story.When it finally ended the ending was empty and incomplete with the exception of the baby which they didn't even show."
2,Overrated,"I am very surprised that this film has been receiving such good reviews. The film raises important questions - and then completely wimps out, avoiding giving any answers. One reviewer mentioned, I think, that the ending was somewhat unsatisfying. I'd change that to COMPLETELY unsatisfying."
4,"Don't get collections, get the original","This cd has many good songs, but if you want to get some real music there is much much more in the original albums of these artists. There for you are not getting the whole pakage."
5,RONNIE DOES IT AGAIN!,You can't beat Ronnie McDowell for good music. He needs to let his hair grow out again though....LOL....Short haircuts make him look older!! (hope he doesn't read this.....LOL.)
1,DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!!!,"I gave this book one star, however it should be less. I felt it was a poorly written book, because the author continuously referenced other source materials throughout the book. It clearly demonstrated the authors' lack of personal experience and knowledge of police work. It appears they mostly commented on their personal opinion of how they feel community policing should operate instead of facts and experience.This book would be an excellent source for a high school book report, but a waste of time for law enforcement professionals."
3,Vermont American Dado blades,"I bought the cheapest priced dado blades I could find, since I won't be using them a whole lot.The two sawblades combined cut a perfect one quarter inch dado, but installing the chippers between thetwo saw blades to get a one half inch dado was a bit disappointing. The chippers are just a bit smaller indiameter than the saw blades, so the bottom of the dado is not flat, but slightly ""Stair-Stepped"".I knew they were not carbide, so they will dull much faster than carbide blades. All things considered,I am satisfied with the set. If I were doing a lot of dado cuts I would invest in better quality and higherpriced blades."
1,Clean Up Your Act Hal Leonard,"Thanks to Ettore of Italia for his valuable review. I was not aware that this was a reprint of ""Inner Jazz."" I have a copy of that book already (I've been studying a long time) and was impressed by the insights of Les Wise, which is what initially attracted me to the present title under discussion. I hope Hal Leonard is not using his name as bait to sell the unwary public previously pubished material. I was going to buy Les Wise's new book of Beach Boys vocal transcriptions so I could study in exacting detail how they managed those creamy harmonies. But now I'll be visiting the local sheet music store to inspect the goods rather than to purchase this book sight unseen."
4,Very fast.,"It is very fast and it works with NOkia's. The only thing is that It does not have ant home charger. Only car charger. But you may charge with any USB mini cable. I did it with an N95 USB cable. It is a standard cable.Charge last a long time for me. I did not test it, since I am using it rarely in long time. Just opening when I lost :)"
5,A great little GPS receiver!,This product worked flawlessly for me on a recent long trip. It put my handheld Garmin GPS to shame with it's extremely fast satellite aquisition time and tracking capability. On the road it was usually locked onto at least eight satellites and often ten or eleven. It's sturdy and compact and it came with a nifty little adjustable suction cup windshield mount that held it securely in place with velcro. It uses a readily available Nokia lithium ion cell phone battery that lasted for over twenty four hours before it needed recharging. It's accuracy was so good that on my notebook's GPS mapping program you could tell which lane of an Interstate you were in. It's an excellent product by a dedicated GPS company in Taiwan at a very resonable price!
1,Clogs your pores,"Like some others I had high hopes for the product, but it clogged my pores pretty bad and gave me more zits. Different stuff works for different people and unfortunately this product had the opposite of the intended and hoped for effect on me."
1,Misleading product,"I used this product for over a month. It prevents red zits, but clogs your pores in the process. It caused so many blackheads that I had to stop using it.This is the first time that I've written a bad review. It really is THAT bad of a product that I felt compelled to leave a bad review.I am generally a fan of Scarzone products, but I don't recommend this item at all."
5,Sudden Change Scar Zone & Acne Treatment,This is the best stuff I have ever used for my monthly breakout issue. It fades spots from old acne and keeps your face clear. It also just makes my skin look amazing. I hope Amazon never stops selling this product. I saw dramatic results within the first week of using this. I love it!
3,"its okay, worth a shot","this was an OKAY product, i certainly didn't wake up the next morning with 5 star air brushed model skin. it does make your skin peel a bit if you dont rub it in properly, depends mostly on how sensitive your skin is. if its pretty resistant, dont bother with this. if its not that resistant, then have a go at it. my skin was a bit resistant, but not that much. i noticed after a few weeks the scars were deffinitely less visible and less red, mine weren't acne they were pimple ones. but still, i went through hell having 2 put make up on them every morning before school :( they are less noticable now, but not a massive improvement. i havnt used it for that long, but im going to use it for another month or so MAYBE not sure. going to try this mederma thing. mederma is available on amazon."
1,Item not available?,"I've been trying to order this for the past few days. When I put it in the cart, it always say in stock until the final page after I review the payments/etc... Then it says out of stock. Why will they say it is available and in stock when it really isnt?"
2,One of the dumbest DVD's ever made,"It's so bad it is almost funny. Almost. If it cost 50 cents, it would be overpriced."
3,Worked Only Marginally for Me,"This particular 5-HTP worked in only the most marginal way for me. Please note that I am merely describing my own experience with this brand and you may have a different experience with it. These tablets are 50 mg and other brands may have been a little more effective because they're 100 mg, although I tried two tablets at once.I don't think price is a signal of quality - at least it didn't work that way in my experience."
3,Industrial blues,"Fine album, but not really inspired. I know - Mayall is a king, but the album sounded a bit like making product on the assembly line."
3,soft and no dogs allowed,"Several john mayall cds have really made an impact on me. The last one with the ""road dogs"" band was enjoyable and was hard edged enough to make me think that Mayall was not over the hill, or sloppy as he has been on some recordings. Many artists have up and downs in their career and with a history as long as Mayalls, you are bound to have a few low points. This is apparently one of them. John Mayall is the master of the roller coaster, one record great, the next a mess, and this is one of the messes.The hard, sinuous bass lines laid down on the last cd are soft and muted and don;t add anything to this record. Same bass player. Did John school him into his brand of blues and defuse his soul? Not sure.The lyrics and driving blues of the previous effort are sure not part of this record. For a double cd it is awash in mediocrity. Too bad. Same band, hard and driving on one record, now soft and not a dog bite in this one."
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""I THINK YOU USED UP ALL YOUR ENERGY BLOWING OUT THE CANDLES ON YOUR 70TH BIRTHDAY!""","This CD is a total disappointment! After being impressed (Despite a voice showing age.) with his 70th Birthday CD (See previous Shaq review) I was excited when I saw this released. But this CD is really poor. The voice is about gone, and the lyrics range from ridiculous to absurd! A sample for ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"" fans: ""Chaos in the neighborhood/our city park is a garden of misery/a sick population all beyond recovery/it's hard to be homeless."" Or ""will your baggage/even make the flight/or will they lose them/somewhere in the night"" LAST BUT NOT LEAST: ""Get ready for the world and all the things we left behind/farewell Kona Village I'll be back some other time.""Shaq hopes Kona Village is a retirement community, where a blues singer should go to retire and live near the Seinfeld's! (Maybe John can run for President of the condo association!)"
5,Terrific cookware,"This version of Kitchen Aid stainless cookware is virtually indestructible. The images posted on this site have nothing to do with the quality and durability of this cookware. After ten years with this same cookware set there are no torn handles and if you bother to use some steel wool once in a while on your pans they will not have turn dingy, or dark grey. If you want to invest in good quality items then learn how to take care of them. As for sticking eggs or other food, yes this does happen. Again the occasional light steel wool application helps sticking. Try cooking your eggs in a little butter on top of a piece of bread. Lots less sticking and quite tasty."
4,Excellent Cookware,I got this set as a replacement for my Revere and it's been great. I've had it almost a year now and it's still beautiful and preforms very well. Love the handles on the pots and the inner surface is super slick to be stainless steal. Love the selection of sizes too. Just wish they had a big skillet - that is my only negative. I liked this so much I bought a set for a friend when she had her kitchen remodeled.
5,these are a great set at a great price,these were given as a christmas gift and the recipient loves them. this was a great price as we were going to pay about 50 more at a retail store. would highly recommend
3,Difficult to clean!,"The set is OK, but the pans are really difficult to clean and not really suitable for frying. I am not sure if this is a common problem for brushed steel sets or if it is a quality issue for this particular one."
5,An absolutely EXCELLENT buy,"I bought this TV based on the reviews and I must say that it actually EXCEEDED my expectations. The HD 780p/1080i picture is absolutely outstanding. Ran a DVD in using one of the HDMI connections and the picture was quite impressive. The only minor drawback is that the 480i digital cable picture could be better. Even with that, I am very pleased with this TV and would highly recommend it, especially at the price. If you are looking for a quality HDTV and do not want to spend a fortune, stop looking, your search is over. The 56HM195 will fit the bill nicely."
2,EXPENSIVE,"Product was exactly what I expected and received on time. However, when I saw the $40.00 price tag I thought I was getting two containors. I have purchased this product many times - all under $20.00 per 2 oz container. This container was charged at $40.00 plus, not including shipping. Would not buy again. Gave the review 2 stars because it really was my fault for buying at that price."
4,Exactly as it should be,"This product is exactly what you'd expect it to be at this price point. It's functional and works well, I used it to connect a dipole antenna to my Sony radio."
5,Works Great,I lost this Balun during a move. It connected to the antenna on my radio. This product works great.
3,Dark Watcher,"All Thea wanted was a simple life, running her magic shop with her best friend Suzanne, maybe getting to go to Mexico someday. She's hardly the type you'd expect to be one of the most powerful Lightbringers to ever live, but she is, unknown to herself until her Watcher finds her. In taking her under his protection, Dante draws her into the war between light and darkness that has raged for centuries. As the passion between them ignites, so does the battle, forcing them to make choices and sacrifices that will affirm life and rend their hearts. In this story, the contrast between the lightly humorous world Thea has existed in and the seriousness of her new life has the same effect of light and shadow in a Renoir, making a sharp distinction in the mind's eye so that the poignant end is even more so."
1,disappointing story with undeveloped characters,"After loving all the books in the Dante Valentine series, I was excited about moving on to Ms.Saintcrow's Watcher books. I was disappointed by this first one. It was a little boring. We don't get to see much action. The lead character, Theodora, is not fully developed. Much of her past and her powers are just glossed over. And she is annoyingly stubborn to a fault. The Watcher sent to watch her is said to be a great warrior but we don't get to experience much of that. Instead, he spends much of the book just mooning over Theodora to the point of being irritating. If you are looking for an action book you will be disappointed. This is more of a romance. I finished the book only because I kept waiting for the fun to begin. But it never did."
5,Compelling page turner,"None of the cliches of fantasy wicca tales in Lilith Saintcrow's Dark Watcher -- her fresh story and compelling characters draw readers in immediately and don't let go. I was left quivering, wanting to beg for more. If you want romance in a Bad Girl Witch tale, this is the book for you."
3,Okay ONLY for beginners,"If you already have done some programming, it'd be better to spend your money on a book with a little more serious approach. However for complete novices, who are new even to programming this book may be of good use. All in all this is good buy for those who don't have any experience in programming at all"
2,Hmmmmm - needs work,"Peter Wright obviously is a very intelligent guy, I bet he learns very quickly too. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be able to pass on his knowledge. In depth explanations, this book is NOT. IF you really want to LEARN VB this isn't the right book. If you want a book that allows someone to show off their talent, then, this is the book. I think Mr Wright needs to understand one thing, just because your good at something doesn't mean you can teach it. I think this book is more an intermediate level book. ....."
2,"Starts off good, but rapidly becomes confusing","I bought this book hoping to learn some of the basics of Visual Basic 6, simply for my own enjoyment. However, as I get deeper into it, I am finding that it is becoming increasingly frustrating. Tools are introduced with little to no explanation, code is tossed at you with the simple moniker, ""trust me"" and there is no comprehensive reference or index in which you can look up more information on something of interest. There is also very little information on trouble-shooting buggy code. Basically (no pun intended) I am not very happy with this book."
1,The index in this book is virtually worthless.,"A friend tells me that there is an easier way to set things up using the FORMAT function. I know little about this function and go to this text book to read up. Unfortunately, the FORMAT function is not in the index.I want to look up ITEM DATA VALUES for assigning text into list/combo boxes which the computer sees a related number which is easier for the computer to digest; however, the topic is NOT in the index.I go to the library and look through a variety of Visual Basic textbooks and all list above topics in index and explain topics precisely.These are just two of my many problems using a very limited index. If you are going to use this text as a reference book, you are going to find yourself very frustrated. I know I am regretting purchasing this book."
3,"Decent, but author's ""cutesy"" style is distracting","For all the other reviewers that complain there is not enough ""meat and detail"", LOOK AT THE COVER!!!! ""BEGINNING"" is the largest word in print!The book covered topics well (for me, a beginner). I think the author could have cut 1-200 pages out of the book (with no loss of useful information) by leaving out conversational anecdotes and observations. It's one thing to blather on when helping the reader to understand, it's another to do it just to up the page count. I found it time-wasting and distracting.I did get lots of VB answers, though. (Just had to sift through the wordiness)."
1,Good enough for the design time,"This book is just meant for beginners. Those of you who want to get started with visual basic, this is okay for you, though it is not very wise to buy this book.Its only meant to get familiar with the controls and not enough of the complex stuff is included here."
5,Top 10 VB6 Books,This book is designed to teach you how to write useful programs in Visual Basic 6 as quickly and easily as possible. You will be amazed at how easy it is and how much you can do. This book starts you off with a solid foundation of the VB6 environment then moves you to a full understanding of writing Visual Basic code. Then it takes you to mastering databases and graphics and leads you into a good understanding of ActiveX controls. With this book you will be developing your own powerful programs in a months time.FinancialNeeds.com
1,no,"I think that there is no value to incur.It was disappointed considerably.Since it is very regrettable contents, it cannot recommend."
5,Great fun for the grownups!!,"This is a fast-paced game and we have a blast with it. If you are looking for something new and different, this would be a great option!!"
4,What a fun game!,"This is a fun, fast-paced game that anywhere from 2 to 8 or more can play. It's easy to learn and hilarious when played."
5,gift for myself and others,A friend of mine brought this game to a girl night and everyone loved it so much that I bought everyone who was there including myself this for Christmas.
5,Great family game,Got this game for grandchildren at Thanksgiving! Had a great time playing with them. We live in area where there are Amish settlements so kids were familiar with the pictures on the cards.
2,How to get comparison-list checkboxes without being useful,"The picture's a little fuzzy, but more importantly, this TV is a case study in manufacturers adding features just to get checkboxes, not to add functionality.There's a composite input, an S-Video input, component input, and a side composite input. But as it turns out, there's only one audio input on the back, so you can choose just one of composite, S-Video and component. And if that weren't enough, the side input overrides the back input. So even with four supposed video inputs, to watch more than one device, you need to swap cables or an external switcher.On top of that, the users manual was only in French. I had to trawl through Philips' site to find an English copy to figure out why it wasn't working as any rational person would expect."
2,The truth about Money,I found this book lacking in honesty. Edelmans nonsense about how awful index funds are compared to managed funds is utter silliness. He fails to mention all of the costs associated with managed funds when comparing to indexed funds.
2,Misses Mark on Life Insurance,"Not a bad reference guide, overall. However, it missed the mark completely on Life Insurance. In only very specific circumstnaces should a person buy anything but Term insurance. As the saying goes, ""Buy Term and invest the rest!""I have no idea what Ric was thinking with his Life Insurance guidance,"
3,NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE,"I bought this CD on the strength of her sister's work, the buzz and reviews. Didn't like it, thought it was mediocre at best. Don't mean to be so mean, but in my humble opinion she's nothing to write home about."
1,This book is WEIRD!,"Ok- i was joking when I said that Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry was the worst book that I have read. Baitchopper is worse!!! It has a pointless plot and doesn't develop at all. I read it in my Advanced 6th Grade English class. It should have a label on it that reads: SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: IF YOU READ THIS BOOK, YOU MAY INSTANTLY EXPLODE!"
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"I must the Rough Guide for recommending this CD of consort music of William Lawes who was a personal friend of Charles I and who supported him during the English Civil War. Unlike the previous reviewer I have no extensive knowledge of consort music. I found the performance of Phantasm to do a great job in perfoming this deceptively simple music. The set in G with its pavane, air on the plainsong and aire to be one of my favorite. This mostly melancholy music is quite stunningly beautiful throughout and brought tears to me eyes often. Highly recomended to all classical music lovers."
3,poetry for a lifetime,"Poetry for a lifetime is a very good selection of enjoyable poems. However, the little reviews the compiler of the collection chose to make before the poems appears to make one believe that he feels his opinion of the poem is more important than letting the readers make up their own minds about the poem's meaning and merit. I prefer to enjoy the poem without a review beforehand. If I wanted to become ""educated"" about the meanings of these poems, I might consider taking a class from some one such as Samueal Etheredge..."
2,Apealing to the older reader....,"Poetry for a Lifetime seems to aim at people over 50 and those who enjoy sappy sayings. It contains many classics, but not as many as expected. A great disapointment I had, was that the authors' names weren't listed in the contents; only poem titles. If you find your favorite poems by looking up reliable names (like me), this stands as a pain in the ""rear""."
2,"I liked It's 5 o'clock somewhere, but this is horrible.....","G'n'R is my favorite band of all time, so when I heard Slash was coming out with a solo project I was thrilled. 5 O'clock was a disappointment, but still not bad. Ain't Life Grand doesn't even compare to the previous album. They scrapped the Axl Rose knock-off voice from their last cd and went for more of a '90s sound this time around. Surprisingly, the Axl clone sounded better..."
5,Excellent,"This is a very good CD. Reminds me of early GNR. Killer riffs, good hooks and vocals. In my opinoin it is much better then Five O'clock Somewhere."
5,Slash,"The Second album from Slash's Snakepit (featuring the now permanent lineup) proves that Slash has still got what it takes ... This hard-rocking, anthemic CD left me not only yearning for more from the top-hatted one, but is on par with any Guns N' Roses album, or for that matter, any hard rock/metal album to date. A definitive example that some things do get better with age."
4,It's rock...who pays attention to the lyrics?,"Ain't life grand is a wonderful guitar album, with plenty of Slash's riffs to go with a singer who can finally sing. I know that I listened to Guns because of the guitar work, and do so here also. As someone who likes hard rock with a blues tinge, this suits my taste fine, although there are certainly places where the melody is sacrificed for technique. Overall, a very good effort. Songs like serial killer and landslide are addictive, and speed parade is a great song to drive to. The songs that devote time to melodic development are very good. Those that don't....well, they're just good old fashioned guitar rock, just not as catchy."
2,Raven please help them!!!,"I am a HUGE Cheetah Girls fan. I mean the movies and soundtracks are amazing. But the new ""TCG"" album is just plain...bad. Songs like 'So Bring It On', 'Uh Oh', 'Break Out Of This Box', and really...A LOT more! I do like 'Do No Wrong' (It is very upbeat, you can dance to it, and it reminds me of just being on the dancefloor), also I like 'All In Me' (which is featured in the KRAFT Mac 'n Chesse commercial.) But The Cheetah Girls really need to get back Raven. She brings the vocals, she co-produces the tracks like ""The Party's Just Begun"", ""Do Your Own Thing"", and more from the CHEETAH GIRLS 2 movie.But I really don't no teenager, or even little young kids would like this CD. It has no point, has no genre, makes no sense, and it is just plain...boring.Good Tracks:""Do No Wrong""""Crash""""All In Me"""
2,Sad attempt to save a sinking ship,"I've been a huge Solas fan for 4 years, so I was thrilled to hear of their most recent release.I cannot describe my disappointment when I found out Solas lost their lead singer AND their lead guitarist. Both members were vital to the band's success, as is proven by this CD. The new lead vocalist pales in comparison to Karen Casey - she has a fine sense of pitch and a clear tone, but she lacks musicality almost entirely. The new guitarist is adequate, but no match for the previous musician's unique rhythmic style. I suspect that the addition of a percussionist to the group is a sad attempt to make up for that loss. Unfortunately, both the percussionist and the new electric bassist only serve to drown out what's left of talent in this shadow of a formerly fantastic band. Seamus should take some time off and reconsider his next musical adventure instead of hanging on to the crumbling shell of Solas."
2,Problems right out of the box,"Purchased the vent to alleviate heat collection in the attic.Mounting and electrical connections were easy, but time consuming.After verifying placement, electrical service, I found the unitthermometer would not work at any temperature setting. The unit was basically non-functional right out of the box.I will not buy another unit. My time and efforts were wasted. $$$$ wasted."
1,Dont waste your time,"Buy this CD if you want to waste your money. I am mad as hell! The beats are good but the vocals are bad! She can not sing plus I know she does people dirty anyway, she did it to my good friend and she deserves no respect from anyone, epecially of her race."
4,OK,"The Cassettes are good, but a bit hard to follow with the book. When repeating words on tape, the one's in the book are scattered about. The tapes are good to learn how the words sound by native speakers."
5,Awesome HOTAS,"Just recieved the x45 and I must say it is far more responsive than the newer x52 and x52pro! The rudder control on the throttle is much better than a twist joystick. No problems downloading and installing the drivers orSST software from Saitek. The CD software is no good. Up and running with FS2004 in 10 mins. The x45 is better suited for the tight stick and responsiveness. I hate a sloppy stick. Overall I will use this one until Saitek comes out with a better model. Hopefully fixing the problems with the craftsmanship of the x52, and placing the rudder control back on the throttle. SST programming was very easy to do. Made programs for 10 games in little over an hour."
5,Good,This item was order for my Sony Ericsson phone I used to own from Europe. I no longer have it. The battery came on time. No defects. Worked good.
1,New Sony Ericsson Standard Battery BST-33,I bought a new cell phone battery from Amazon and the battery will not hold a charge. this is the worst piece of junk i have ever seen.im going to toss it in the garbage. thats were this belongs. very unsatisfied.
4,Entriguing,"This book held my interest, all the way through. Many characters were involved, I found myself getting them confused sometimes. Still, I wanted to finish the book to see what happened. I am always interested in time travel and have read several books on the subject. This one was a little different."
4,The Mirror,"I purchased this paperback book in 1978 and I have read it three times and will read it again before long. this was a excellent book, did not want it to end."
5,One Of The Best!,"I came across THE MIRROR by sheer luck at a used bookstore. I picked up the book, looked at the title, and thought that it sounded interesting. By the time I finished the book, I felt that I had experienced that unique feeling that you get when you become one with a book. There was absolutely nothing to dislike. I did what everyone who has read it does, I passed it to others to read, and eventually, lost the book. I was thrilled to see it back in print and hope others will enjoy it as much as I have. It is a book that every woman should read, and even if it means losing it, share it with your daughter, mother or a friend."
4,Works well but not exactly whisper quiet.,"I think this does a better job then the stock cooler, as it directs the heated air out the back of the case. One of the easier ones to install, took all of 5 min. One down side for me is the fan, while quiet, is not totally silent. But then I expect my PC to make no noise at all when it is running. Probably not the best choice for a HTPC. I think the price is a bit on the high side also."
5,captivating from the very first line,"Stuart Woods once again steals the hearts of thriller bookworms in his latest book, ""Dead in the Water."" Mr. Woods writes books with details that everyone wonders about, but wouldn't ask. Take this one on a vacation, but bring more Woods' titles, because you'll finish it before the final boarding call."
4,I'm very sad that a great writer turned tabloid. Sigh.....,"Where was the writer who once wrote great story like RUN BEFORE THE WIND, GRASS ROOT, CHIEFS? Now, all I could find in Woods' stories were just tabloid garbage. There were no profound characters anymore, only superfluous down-to-earth low lives or disgusting people who spent too much time in murderings, eatings and drugs. Woods was once treated by me as one of the greatest and most talented current writers in America, but not anymore. Maybe a writer too enjoyed good life did hurt his greatness in the long run, that's why there is an saying that ""The great writing could only be achieved when the writer was in poverty.&quot"
3,A great summer read.,"I am a long-time Woods fan, and thoroughly enjoyed the fast pace and twists and turns of this novel. However (without wanting to sound prudish), I could definately do without the indescriminate and raunchy sex -- it didn't enhance the story at all, but rather detracted from it. Other than that, it is a great, quick read perfect for a day of total relaxation."
3,Too slow paced for me,I read all the time. I like books that are grabbers. This one was not one of them. It was slow and too long for the happenings. I was so excited to find a new author only to be let down. Not sure if I'll read more from RM.
1,Not Worth Buying!!,"I'm a true MJ fan and miss him each and every single day. RIP. Although I always knew he was innocent, I wanted to see that things were like around the time of the trial, hence purchasing this DVD. Do not buy it! Honestly, it's just a waste of your time and money. Random 'celebs' give a shout out to MJ but doesn't really seem like anyone was there by his side as he endured this false allegations. The video quality is also bad and the commentary is not presented in a serious tone. Honestly fans, save your money and watch Live in Bucharest instead. Thanks for the awesome memories Michael - we love you more."
3,The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer,"This is a prequel to Stephen King's ROSE RED, which I haven't seen or read. No matter. It's 88 minutes and I watched 18 of them. Great recreation of the early 20th century and a good spooky atmosphere, but the story just didn't pull me in. That probably says more about me than it does about the movie. Written by Ridley Scott, whose ALIEN franchise also does nothing for me."
3,Interesting But Sexual,I liked this movie but there was too much sex in it. I understand thats what happened but it could have been lessened and spoken about not shown. I wouldn't recommened it to anyone though.
5,Perfection,"Arrived the exact day they said it would be here, and in perfect condition. Good job Amazon!"
5,Go get the next edition,I am really satisfied with this handbook. I am a beginning proficiency in this adventure and this book is showing in a clear matter the aerodynamic issues.
1,Shouldnt trust anything about Korean war.,"I would like to mention there is a book called ""Again Korea"" on Korean war by Wilfred Burchet.I personally havent read this book, but if u compare credibility of Wilfred and Bruce, Wilfred is much more creditable, because he was active during the time of war.Wilfred is just discredited, because he seems like on the side of communist.( or he might have thought communism is the justice )By the way, after reading Wilfred's book, I became pretty sure Korean war is started by South puppet army led by US."
5,Excellent Book,This book tells you everything you will need to know about the Stonewall. It also has a huge collection of games where the Stonewall is used. I highly recommend this book to anybody who needs a defence against 1 d4.
3,No to revision.,"I've been quite pleased with how Yoko has remastered John's catalog. However, I'm not thrilled with the remixes. When John recorded his albums he approved the mixes as they were. Period.And as for STINYC, the song selection should have been left alone. None of the tracks should have been cut and the two added could have been listed as bonus material."
5,Excellent!,"I love this cd. Thank you for sending it so quickly. Item was exactly as described. I would definitely buy from you again, and will recommend you to a friend."
1,bulgar wheat from my favorite site: Amazon.com,"I had never tried preparing bulgar wheat before, had no idea how to season it, so I purchased the box of 6 oz bags (pk of 12 with herbs)of Melissa's Tabbouleh. The seasonings in it were too strong and I didn't know how to prepare it either, but going by the instructions that came with it I couldn't eat it.Unless a person really really likes to eat lemon rinds, I doubt if they'd be able to eat it. We weren't. The problem is I got an oversupply of it and ended up tossing it all. Next time, if I try eating bulgar again (which I might because I'm trying to make more healthy food choices and I don't doubt the value of bulgar) I would instead buy it plain and season with our personal favorite seasonings and use that as a starting place.This is not the fault of the company that made this product, it is entirely my fault for not knowing what I was purchasing."
4,excellent,"The previous reviewer has given terrific detail on Black Octopus and laid all you need to know on the table.This is a pretty wicked jazz funk album with some avant-gaurd touches. It is well recorded and has fantastic playing and some great soul vocals.This is not worth selling the farm for, but if you are rich or really want this album, you will not be disappointed in its excellent audio quality, fat bass lines and quality jazz work.But this is not atypical of high end 70s jazz funk. On the in print retail market I would fully endorse it.But wait for the reissue; don't morgage the house or spend baby Suzie's Harvard money for 2027."
4,Great tape--Dr Laura makes sense,"I borrowed a copy from a friend, and now I'm buying one as a father's day present. This is great stuff. How does a woman gain such insight into the minds of men? Better than that Men are from Mars... series"
5,My favorite new CD,"Acoustic blues/folk with some really fine fingerpicking and slide guitar. Some of it rocks too though. The first song, ""Dark American Night"" is a great soundtrack for when you have to drive somewhere late at night."
5,Learning a new city,"My family and I relocated to the Chicago area, and wanted to learn as much about it as we could.Streetwise Chicago Map Laminated City Center Street Map of Chicago, Illinios Folding pocket size travel map with CTA & Metra map including lines & stationsThe book has been very helpful. We've have already hit some of the great locations recommended. The books concise descriptions helped us determine where we did or did not want to go."
2,only one mouse,"When I first heard about this I thought ""it's about time they put the mouse on a motorcycle series on dvd"". But guess what, it's only one of the three episodes! And it's not even the first one! how dissapointing this is. Why can't these guys ever get it right?! Here I was all set to get this for my 5 year old nephew and it's only one episode and not the first. And what are these two other no-name episode?! What dummies make these brainless decissions? Just like when tv execs decide to show tv series episodes out of order so that it's hard to follow along! Come'on guys it's not that hard! 1 leads to 2 which leads to 3. Get it and get a clue! Anyways I won't buy this till they get it right!"
4,"Big Story, little word count",I was surprised that such an interesting story could be told with only a few words. Wiesner's pictures tell of an incredible story of imagination and creativity. This book will be in my classroom for a long time.
3,Tuesday,"My son and I were looking for a book for him to read, and this picture book was not it; however, the illustrations are very beautiful."
5,This book really did save my life,"I cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone who seriously wants to quit smoking. I was an addicted smoker for 35 years and have been smoke-free for 16. I know I will never smoke again.Dr. Colby's book is a 14-day plan using self-hypnosis. I used this book, plus behavior modification techniques that I knew of (rewarding myself, etc.) and was very successful.I wish this book would be printed and more available again, as it's literally a life saver. I had never used self-hypnosis before, but was it effective. Please get the book for yourself or anyone who wants to quit. I have bought it (after much searching) for friends, who also were able to quit. What a book!!"
2,Pretentious and Pretend,"I am a high school teacher in the Denver area. I try to read all new novels that I think will be of interest or interesting to my students. I don't think any student would identify with this book as all the characters are so exagerated in their portrayals. The book tended to be black or white and nothing in between. I realize a young adult wrote this but that in itself does not make it valid. I would love to discover a book of truth and one my students could identify with pertaining to their ""everyday"" lives."
2,a worthy first effort,"Spoon-fed and predictable narrative, strong dialogue. While I have nothing short of utter awe and amazement that a 16-year-old wrote this novel, I will suggest that this entire premise of the nucear-suburban-family-run-amok can be grasped in brilliant clarity in the classic Richard Yates novel, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I've been on Clay Aiken Boards for a while and have heard about this book and even thought I didn't hear as much about the book as I did the author I went ahead and bought myself a copy just to see what the book was about and I have to say that The good reviews that give it 5 out of 5 stars or 4 out of 5 stars are all coming from friends of the author's or those that call themselves ""Claymates"" There is no way this book has movie potential. Although it is halfway decent it really isn't worth the tree they killed to publish it and doesn't bring much money in Garage Sales or e-bay."
5,A DIFFERENT LIFE,"Oh how different her life was from mine, I never knew the world she writes of, yet she made we feel as if it was me with every turn of the page. She made my heart race with love and anticipation and my pages wet with tears. This is a must read for everyone who never knew the 60's or for those wanting to go back in time."
4,Great improvement over standard phone cable,Worked as expected but the connectors were hard to remove once installed. I would give it five stars if I did not have to fight with the bulky connectors.
2,"Bobby Rydell ""Then and Now""","You know how some artists make an album a little later in their career with re-do's of all of their hits...or most of their hits...plus some new stuff? This is that one for Bobby Rydell. The new stuff is marginal. Some of the old stuff is not the original recording. A few tracks are the originals and leave you asking yourself...""Why did I buy this? I should have just bought his original hits, remastered, on some ""Bobby Rydell's Greatest Hits"" CD. I wish I had my money back."
1,Don't waste your money or time.,"I am a life long PC user who also has 3 Macs. I just purchase 2 of the hottest new Macs for my video edit suite and saw this book on the shelf and grabbed it without opening it. I actually thought it would contain some useful information about the OS X and help me get up to speed easier. Foolish me for judging a book by its cover. This author should be ashamed of himself. The only thing worse than the content is the writing. I do recommend this publisher however for anyone who cannot write and doesn't have much to say because clearly they don't care either.Bottom line - I purchased the Mac! I don't need to be validated or praised as a ""switcher."" The book is full of Mac ads and commercials and who needs that. What I wanted was to know how the Mac and PC are the same and how to get the job done in OS X not an assemblage of why the PC is inferior.BTW: I don't write reviews but this book is so bad I felt it was a must."
4,"Love it, but it is mistitled","The title of this book should be: Mac OS X: The Alter-Ego ExperiencesThis is an ego boosting book for mac users, especially for the switchers.This book, if read as a guidebook, might only give preliminary information.But I enjoy the book, not for its purpose as a switcher's guide. But more toward in learning the experiences of the author (and some switchers that are being interviewed) answering his problems/questions during the conversion period. Treat it as a light book for your leisure time, turn on the iPod then read this book, and smile."
3,Running on empty,"Eric's playing and song writing have inspired me for years. I've been through the album 6 times in 3 days. But, I keep coming to the same conclusion: this recording is uninspired.There IS quite a variety of styles, from classic twang to 80's adult contemporary stylings. But, in general, the recording is so overly compressed and drowning in reverb that it's not clear why they bothered to release it in stereo."
4,"Good album, producer made bad decisions with the vocals","This is another good album from Eric Johnson. The songs, the guitar playing and guitar sounds are great. However I am a lot less inclined to listen to this because the vocal are so Auto-Tuned. If this sort of thing bothers you then be forewarned! (it bothers me and it grates to my ear)There are many reasons why Auto-Tune would have been used on this album; lack of time for lots of vocal takes, lack of time in post production, producer thinks it sounds good, etc...One star off for that. Shame on you, Mr producer. Ah Via Musicon didn't have Auto-Tuned vocals... Does anyone here think that the vocals sounded bad on that record?End of rant."
2,A huge dissapointment!,"What can I say? I can see other reviewers rate this cd as a 4 and 5 star? How can they do that. Someone says it's as good as ""A Via Musicom"" and ""Venus Isle"" I think this cd is very, very booring. Eric plays the guitar like George Benson and his voice sounds like Michael Jackson. And...we've been waiting about 10 years for this?"
4,Scrolls update,"A thoroughly comprehensive and concise review of the history, palaeography and findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls. I recommend it for anyone who found the various reports on this subject confusing and just wants a clear understanding of what the Scrolls have meant and continue to mean to Biblical history."
4,"Brilliant, Bold and Beautiful","One of the best recent 4ad releases! Though it took me a while to appreciate the album, it was worth the patience. Don't expect the usual dance or ambient stuff, this is experimental at its best!! If you are a fan of the label and electronic music, this may be what you have been waiting for--great combination! The packaging of the cd is also quite innovative."
1,Works about as well as scotch tape,"After 3 tries, it finally removed one eyebrow hair. I looked at the instructions to see if I was missing something, but there wasn't much to miss - press on and pull off. The last time I tried it, it actually stung a little bit, so it seemed it should have worked. This product is worthless."
4,"I have thick, coarse hair and...","they do work for not being that expensive. yes, the shaping takes a bit of skill, but it's nothing that can't be mastered! when you read reviews about only being able to use one strip once, they aren't kidding! the glue only seems to stick just once. i have to say these are pretty painless, and they are great for upkeep between expensive and painful salon visits. i don't think the results last quite as long as a salon though. i have very thick eyebrows and i let them get pretty bad before i gave these a go, and like i said, they did their job!oh, and you know those itchy bumps you get after you go to a salon and get those suckers waxed? i got the same bumps from these! not half as bad though. i have a soothing aloe gel that i bought for my brazilians that i just slop right on the itchy bumps and usually my sensitive skin calms right down within about an hour.i do recommend these if you have the time to get your brows just right :)"
2,ABRIDGED!,"I bought this as a gift for my 2yo son and was unhappy to discover that the story has been significantly abridged. The plot is there, but much of the charm is gone. Very disappointing."
2,Mike Mulligan Kindle,"This version does not translate well onto my PC. I can often see the book's narrative at the same time as the narrative added by Kindle. The words sometimes don't match the pictures being shown, or the pictures are shown twice in succession - first in miniature, then full sized. It is awkward to read to my class at school. This is the first time I've had this kind of problem with a PC Kindle book."
5,No Problems,Birds took to the pellets easiley. I even give seeds with the pellets and they eat both. The food is really enticing to them and they seem to like it.
1,Hidden agenda?,"Can't help to feel there is a ""hidden agenda"" so to speak with this ""Art"". The odd feeling of being around those ""conspiracy theory"" types that I have grown to loathe is the only feeling evoked upon my conscience when viewing the hundreds of pages. Colorful as it may be, there is just an uneasy feeling. Quite reminiscent to regurgitated sour milk from a quart long past its due date."
3,For the Doom Enthusiast,"Picked this book up as my first collection of Doom Patrol and, frankly, I was lost. A book for those that have kept up with the series but not for a beginner. Art was also dated and lacked luster. Might try another book by Grant in the future. :("
5,Food for reflection,"I liked this book so much I bought 15 copies to give to my special friends. Occasionally, one comes across something which is too good not to share. This book is one of those things. And I bought Remen's first book to read, Kitchen Table Wisdom, which is equally wonderful. It's not about cooking! It contains thoughts that feed the soul, at least that is my experience."
5,My randfather's Blessings,"This has to be one of he finest and most worthwhile books I have had the pleasure o readin. In it, the author recounts dozens o personal exoeriences not only with her wonderful gandfather, but withmany patients whom she cared for in her medical practice. These accounts are often so moving that I would urge anyone who picks up this book to be prepared to shed more than a few tears! If, like me, you have fallen into the habit of considering life boring or arather jaded, then this book will soon give you a new perspective! It's a wonderful experience, in a world full of egotism to find an author who actually shows us how wonderful people can be and ofen are! It is impossible to come away from reading this book unmoved."
5,Excellent!,I love this book! Well written stories of personal experiences with deep meaning. Glad I ordered this in paperback and not on Kindle as I highlighted many passages that I will read again and again.
4,Un-Natural Disaster,I like this book alot....it helps me to understand what happened and what went on during the train wreck. My husband was one of them that died in it. And this will hopefully answer some questions out son will have later when he is old enough to know what happened. He was 10 days old when his daddy died.
5,Lucinda Rules!,"This CD entitled Bright Light is fun, heartfelt, and emotional all at the same time. It is what CD's used to be, every song better than the next. My favorite tracks are ""Gemini Moon"", ""Heaven Tonite"" and ""In Denim"". But you will love them all. Most CD's give you one song that is really good and the rest will stink. But ""Bright Light"" is great from beginning to end. Lucinda is beautiful and sings like an angel."
1,Not even worth $13,"This is a very cheap looking ring. The band may be 3mm wide, by it's less than .10mm thick. It is bent more oval than round, and the stone setting looks to have been welding on by a child. I wanted to wear this as an alternative to my wedding band, but the stone is so small. It's supposed to be 1 carat, but it looks smaller than my .80 carat solitare.I am sad about this ring, and I think I may return it. I will purchase something from QVC instead."
3,Remotes do not stand up,"We purchased several of these units and like them. We live in a southern climate and do not have extremes in temperature.I believe we have installed 5 or 6 units.We have noticed problems with the remote controls though. They do not last. We have purchased wire baskets for them to keep them next to the units protected yet, within 2-3 yrs 3 of them have stopped functioning. The displays give out and they are nonfunctional. In calling the company I was told by the receptionist that to replace the remote it would cost $45 for a universal remote and $65 for the original remote plus $15 shipping. The remotes do not appear to be of a quality/size that matches that price in my humble opinion. I was told the remotes are never covered in the warrantee. The units come with one remote each. I am realizing how expensive a cooling/heating system this will be having to replace all the remotes every 2-3 years."
1,What's all the hype about ?,"Read this book after hearing a lot about it.I agree with other reviews here, there is not much of a plot, and the writing is very ordinary.I am not much of a writer, but seriously, I think I could do better if I had to write a book to be published.The time I spent on this book would be better spent on some other book, wish I knew that before starting this book."
5,Best bio to date,"If you want to hear Buddy Holly's music, watch Gary Bucy in his Hollywood bio-pic about Buddy. If you want the facts and insight, watch ""The Real Buddy Holly Story."" I teach pop music history at the college level and am always looking for source material, and I found it with this project. I watched this movie and then a few months later had a chance to go to Lubbock and Clovis. This documentary was a great primer before my trip (there are also many good books about Buddy). Music buffs and Buddy fans will especially like this project, as will the casually curious. Now if someone would only produce a definitive documentary about Bill Haley and the Comets . . ."
1,The Real Buddy Holly Story,"Anyone who was a Buddy Holly fan, this DVD is excellant to have. There is real footage, that will bring you back to that era. Paul McCartney did a wonderful job.This is the best DVD on the market. Only wish there was more live footage, but Buddy died at the height of his career, so this is all that has been around.Worth every penny!"
3,hatred of light skin biracial kids,"This book is about raising half black half white kids. In the chapter Just Between Sisters the author claims light skin biracial/black girls are privileged because their light skin. The chapter is also about how light skin biracial/black girls are bullied by dark skin girls that call them conceited because they are light skin and have black ancestary. I 'm a light skin black and I was bullied in Philadelphia (black majority,ninth-poorest US city) by a dark skin girl and called conceited because I'm light skin. In Philly some dark skin black mothers teach their kids light skin biracial/black people are conceited and not to date them. In Philly many dark skin black young adults don't date light skin blacks.I lived in cities that weren't like this. Sometimes brown skin blacks will date them. In Philly there are few light skin biracial/black and dark skin black young adult couples."
4,Best camera available for the money,"This is by far the best camera you can get for $530. I have been extremely satisfied with the advanced settings borrowed from the higher end cameras. It is more or less a small D5 without the full frame sensor or build quality. I will be using this camera while I focus on getting better lenses, then I will upgrade to a full frame sensor and the XTI will be my backup camera. Oh, and never mess with the kit lens... it's crap."
5,Very Satisfied,"Awsome camara. Super shots, clean crisp and very easy to use. A tad heavy for my wife but she has gotten used to it. Great value.Area for improvement is more clarity around the CF card. Would have been nice to know that it was not included in with the camera nor assessory packet. Would also have been good to know specifically what size CF card was need. Spun wheel getting this info on line and ended up going to Best Buy."
5,Brilliant,"This is the best present that I've bought to myself for a while! What a top camera for such an amature photographer like myself.Just point and shoot. If the results are rubbish, then delete it and try again with the other settings.Now, I'm forever taking pictures without the issue with develpoing 35mm film, whilst trying to remember which settings to select whilst taking the 24 / 36 pictures.Well worth the money!"
1,Useless LCD Display,Please note that the LCD display can only be used to check camara settings and play back images. You can not use the LCD display as a view finder. In other words you can not frame your pictures using the LCD display. This is a mayor inconvenience for those of us that use the LCD display to compose the pictures.In my opinion there is no need to have such a large LCD for changing camera settings. This feature waists battery power.
5,Outstanding camera,"Graduated up from an Olympus E-20 and this Rebel smokes it. The user interface is outstanding, really top notch. You can make quick changes on the fly to AF and white balance and ISO speed. The ability to use interchangeable lenses is outstanding. I put a Sigma 70-200mm lens on the Rebel and I get much better shots than ever before. I am a believer that the lens is more inportant than the camera in what kind of pictures you get, but I wouldn't change my mind on starting my rig with a Rebel XTI."
4,Only Canon,"My Photo instructor recommended the Rebel XTi and I am very satisfied with the ease of use, learning the functions and most of all becoming the photographer I never knew I could be. Easy to understand the manual and basic functions. I love the finished product (even unedited). I truly recommend the Canon family for cameras. 10MP is very well enough for the average sizes of photos I need. Beginners don't be afraid. It does adjust well to trial and error. Go for it!"
5,Best Entry Level Digital SLR Keeps Getting Better,The third generation XTi is the successor to the popular Rebel XT. An entry level camera but considered to be quite an excellent performer in many levels.It comes with a battery and a sleek compact charger. It also uses the well known Digic II image processor. Uses CF card.Improvements compared to its older brother XT:- 10 megapixel resolution compared to 8 megapixel for the XT- A larger 2 1/2 inch LCD panel compared to 1.8 inch- A new self-cleaning sensor- 9 point AF system while the XT has 7- Better burst shooting capacity from 23 to 27 frames- 7 LCD brightness levels compared to 5 for better viewing in bright surroundingsPros:- Image quality is superb. Color rendition and low-noise- Light and small- Can shoot RAW format- Impressive long battery life.Cons:- Cannot shoot using the LCD panel. You always have to use the viewfinder. LCD is for menu and playback only.- Supplied lens is very basic. No image stabilizer. Slow.- No movie capability
5,Fantastic Camera,We are just moving into the world of SLR Photography and this camera is fantastic. It is easy to use and takes amazing photos. Beyond impressed.
5,Great Camera -- Fast delivery.,The digital rebel xti was a gift to my daughter. She loves it. It was delivered two days before it was expected.
5,Excellent pictures,"I owned a Canon Rebel 300D. The 400D performs much much better than the 300D. The light meter seems more accurate. The color is much more balanced. It is also much easier to see camera settings on the big LCD. The frame rate is also improved from the old 300D. From what I read, the electronics is probably better than the more expensive Canon 30D; the 30D has better mechanical parts, but I am a casual shooter, I am much more likely to replace the 400D way before the mechanical parts become an issue. I also like the smaller body of the 400D. Would be nice if it has image stabilization in the body and if it has built in wireless."
5,"Great Camera, but skip the kit lens","Excellent quality photos and all the manual adjustiblity you could ever want.BUT before you buy the camera with the 18-55 kit lens, THINK ABOUT BUYING THE BODY BODY ONLY AND A LENS SEPARATELY. The lens is very cheaply made and at f3.5 it limits what you can do in low light situations. I would suggest the Canon EF 50mm/f1.8 II as a good starter lens."
2,"Blah, blah, bland","This book was, well, okay in a kinda bland way. I was a bit disappointed with it. Nevertheless, I bought it for a Kindergarten teacher who was about to leave her kindergarten class on maternity leave in the latter part of the spring. Although it was a ""blah"" read, it helped to open up discussions about the fears of the kindergarten students. Many of them related well with the situation, but the characters themselves including the teacher in the book were not as developed as I had hoped."
4,Fun Even for the Adults,My 9th grader asked for this card game. I thought the name was a little strange but it is perfect for this word game. Man Bites Dog can be enjoyed by anyone who can read with only a slight advantage to the adults.
2,A little dry for my taste,"If you are a student of philosophy and know what logical positivism is and who Immanuel Kant was, then you will enjoy this. If you are just a Simpsons buff, probably not."
5,The Simpsons get their due!,Excellent collection of essays on the philosophical underpinnings and implications of The Simpsons that manages to be both serious and amusing at the same time and gives equal respect to both sides of both subjects. Fully annotated and footnoted to individual episodes and appended with an episode guide through spring 2001.
2,Does not work with Windows 7,I could not get the scanner to work on my windows 7 PC. As of March 2010 there was no driver available to make it work on Windows 7. I can not comment on how well it works since I couldn't get it to work.
4,Great OneTouch,This is an excellent scanner that works with Windows 7 64 Bit. It's priced right and looks right. The speed is fine for personal scanning. Paired with Paperport software it's a keeper in my opinion.
5,"Fun, fun, fun","Aunt Puff and Missing Minerva captures the outlandishness of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the whimsy of Shel Silverstein, and the fun language use of Dr. Seuss in a miracle of a package that will keep you at the edge of your seat (unless the silly hands push you back in). This is a great read. It has whimsy and fun that will appeal to younger children and themes that will appeal to adults and older children.Aunt Puff's friend Minerva has disappeared while trying to teach Alexandra, a twelve year old girl and the ture hero of the story, how to blow bubbles to play bubble gum charades (just one of the many wacky, highly imaginative creations of the author). Aunt Puff, Ludwig (a perfect characterization of a Great Dane), Alexandra, and Ciber (who is Minerva's cockatoo and is completely ""Marbles!) face a whole bunch of out of this world obstacles to find Minerva and save the Elcarim Foundation in the process.Be sure to buy this book. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Useful; worth the price if you don't like man pages,"This pocket reference summarises the basics of CVS. It's enough to get you going, but I wouldn't rely on it for a major project. The explanation of how CVS works is short; the part I've found most useful is the handy table of CVS commands and options in the second half of the book.However, there is extensive online documentation for CVS that goes into far greater depth than this book, is more up to date, and is free. Even though I've had the book, I've still needed to refer to this online documentation to learn the finer points of tags, branching, and other CVS features.So it's really a matter of whether you want to pay to have some (but not all) useful information in a handy booklet. If that appeals to you, great, this isn't a bad book. But you can certainly live without it by using your computer as a reference tool."
4,"In the family line of work Martha takes the middle road,",For a debut album I find Martha Wainwrights work to be Some where in between her more famous Father and Brothers relms of presentations. This album is a pleasure to listen to and interesting to dwell on the lyrical nuances. If I had to say whom her work was more influenced by in its nature I would have to give the nod to her father(Loudin Wainwright III). I personally will purchase her next endevor without previewing any of the tracks. Hopefully its not 3-4 years before I can hear more of Martha's unique vocal qualities.
5,Amazing!,"Her voice, her lyrics, her style, her talent are astounding! She's tough but feminine at the same time and I really relate to that. I just adore her and this cd. She has her own unique sound that really shines among all singer songwriters today. My favorite song is Bloody MF'ing A'hole. Factory is great too. All her songs are great and I look forward to owning everything this woman makes. I don't want to build her up too much, I am content just keeping her all to myself! Although with a talent such as hers, there is NO WAY she'll remain an opening act. She's just getting started and she is going to be HUGE!"
4,Dug it.,"I was at this show. I was disappointed that not all the numbers were included, but there are some really great moments. Of course it's sometimes sloppy - could you get all these people in one place to rehearse for a week? Farrar's ""Devil in Disguise"" was a pleasant surprise as was Jim James' ""Still Feeling Blue"" Lucinda Williams was evanescent on ""A Song For You."" I wondered why Emmy Lou Harris wasn't there. Hillman I can understand - he is really over the whole Parsons revival thing - if you watch the documentary about him you can see he's bitter. Keith Richards singing ""Hickory Wind"" was great - the duet with Nora Jones was a little creeepy. Earle was great, as always. Yoakam should have played with the house band. I'll watch this again for the best parts. Gram lives on. There are other great tributes to him (available here on Amazon). Get them all."
5,Beautiful illustrations,This book has beautiful illustrations. My son is 7 months old and he reaches out to grab at the pages. The illustrations are so colorful and bright. It has a cute story as well.
5,Purrfect for putting your little one(s) to sleep!,"The beautiful illustrations and words of comfort help our two children, ages 2 and 4, at bedtime. The baby tiger expresses his fears of bedtime while mommy tiger provides words to calm and soothe."
5,"A book well worth reading, (Composer/Songwriter/Entertainer","Oni is an amazing surviver.....The struggles she encountered along the way are almost incomprensible. The only explanation I can see for her defying all odds of 6 near death experiences is divine intervention. Her book reveals her courage,faith,and wisdom. Onnce you open up this book, you will want to read it cover to cover.Great Job Oni!"
1,Boring.....,This DVD is the most boringest showmanship of Hip Hop rivalry. I would not recommend this dvd to anyone who is seeking further info on the hip hp world of rivalry.
3,"Good, But Not Up To Expectatcions","Not having seen the first Beef, Beef II is not quite what it is expected to be. You expect to hear full battle raps or the punch line to a battle that you make you say, ""DAMN!!! He ripped a new one!!!"" This only happens with Canibus and LL, in which LL got wooped, but being who he is, didn't losing credit or status. The Beef series is a good way to understand why battles occur and why friends become foes (Eric & P of EPMD, Eminem & Royce da 5'9""). It also shows that you can solve problems man to man (Ice Cube & B-Real (Cypress Hill). I would recommend this dVd to everyone. It is a good buy, but when it's over, you feel like there should be more to it. So buy Beef II and get Beef I, sit down and take a history class on Hip-Hop."
3,"""Beef 2"" Review","The second entry in the ""Beef"" series follows with more in-depth explorations of classic feuds. This time, the beefs include D-12 vs. Royce Da 5'9, KRS-One vs. Nelly, DMX vs. K-Solo, LL Cool J vs. Canibus, Westside Connection vs. Cypress Hill, and plenty others. This time, it's hosted by Keith David. It's only drawback is the missing Eminem vs. Benzino segment which was removed from the retail version due to complaints filed by The Source magazine. If you enjoyed the first 'Beef"", you'll want to see this one too. The interviews with KRS-One are worth it on their own. There's also a great story about Ice Cube going haywire in the Priority Records office."
4,Streets of San Francisco Season Three,"I have yet to buy this season on DVD. I have no doubts as to the quality of the scripts, the acting, and the video quality we're accustomed to from this DVD series and indeed was one of the best seasons if my memory serves me correctly. My disappointment is that they haven't offered the season as a bundle, and almost $60 sure is a lot of money for a TV series season especially after we waited all these years for it. Season 4 was released as a bundle, but it appears that with S5 they're on the same money making scheme of S3. They know the have us, and they have us where they want us. The bottom line is that if you are a big fan of the series and don't mind forking out the bucks, go for it now, 'cause although overpriced it's still good."
4,French life,"I really enjoyed this book. The author gives the readera taste of what it is to live in Paris. I highly recommendthis book for anyone who is interested in France, Paris,culture, or people."
5,I love this book!,"This is a great read for anyone who loves travelling or has lived in a culture other than their own. I had never been to Paris when I first read it, and I read it when I got back and enjoyed it even more the second time around. Have passed it around my friends and family also, and everyone loves it. The cute stories about the difficulties adjusting are humorous and universal. The writer neither glamorises nor puts down her life in Paris, she simply offers an honest story. Great read!"
1,Not Quite.,"This book was very disappointing. I would return it, had I kept the receipt. I was perplexed about why she didn't just focus on making a book about her love life. Maybe that would have been more interesting, but she hardly makes her French boyfriend sound the least bit important to her. I am an American young woman, so maybe I don't understand her humor. Most of the time I felt like the French had to put up with her, and her lack of sophistication,than the other way around. Yet another whiny book about someone living in Paris and complaining about it, which I find completely rude, and sort of seems to justify the French people's animosity towars Americans (though the author is more like the Brits)."
1,A CHICAGO JOKE,"These CD's are a joke. How else can you buy 3 CD's for under $$$. I flipped through the tracks on these CD's hoping to find a decent track, and guess what....I didn't find any. It's a waste of your listening time. For true Chicago House Music Fans...Go to a club instead. I put this set far far away from my good house music CD's. Leave this CD Set in the Warehouse."
5,This is a great CD!,"I recently stumbled on this album and really love it. Ellis Paul has produced 14 albums so it's really hard to have a favorite, but right now this is mine. This CD has some really great songs - ""She Was"", ""Home"", and ""Jukebox on My Grave"" are some of the best.Paul's voice is compelling, authentic and draws you into an emotional experience every time."
4,Pretty Good Debut EP,This EP is pretty good. I have heard better from Drive-Thru but other is great. I got hooked on Hidden In Plain View when I first heard Shamans Witches Magic. More standout tracks are Twenty Below. I cant wait until Hidden In Plain View's album. I can tell they have great potential.
2,This is the worst Chan movie I have seen,"Even though I really like all of the other Chan movies that I have seen this was a severe disappointment compared to his other films. There was almost none of Jackie's great comic fighting, making this movie like all of the other cop movies out there, minimal plot and boring action."
2,Rare Jackie chan drama,"Filmed in 1993, this film is based on a true story. It is not a comedy, as you'd expect from Chan, instead it is a very serious story relying more on acting than action. I am a huge fan of Jackie's, but this movie is one of my least favorite. Jackie does not even crack a smile in this movie. It is worth having if you are a huge fan, but I guarantee it won't be one you watch again and again."
5,"Softening, shine-enhancing, smells marvelous","I just got this in today's UPS and rushed upstairs to shower. Combined with Rene Furterer's ""Fioravanti"" conditioner (which I used because the Klorane citron conditioner is not available in the US) my thick, heavy, wavy hair has become lightweight, soft, shiny, silky and curly! I love this stuff. After my Redken stash gets used up I'm switching to Klorane exclusively (perhaps supplementing with Furterer as needed). Both Furterer and Klorane are owned by the same company, though Klorane's marketing is more ""all-natural"" and ""plant extract"" whereas Furterer's is more ""state of the art"" and ""technology"" based."
1,RCBS uniflow powder baffle,"Seems to be more of a hassel than what it's worth. Can't get a consistant powder charge using it, and I tried it with 4 different types of powders. I've taken it out and used the same 4 different types of powders and seemed to get more of a consistant charge without it. Don't waste your money..."
1,Don't buy this shower CD player!,This was a Christmas present for my son. It quit working about two weeks after Christmas.
5,Watch that stands up to the test!,"i purchased this watch before i went to work at a youth camp for 5 weeks during the summer...i wanted something that could stand up to water, dirt, sweat, heat, and hundreds of teenagers...and, boy, did this thing pass the test! from a weekly mudpit to paint to white water rafting to hiking and every adventure in between, this is a watch that not only survived, but still looks as good as it did when i first got it...a real winner!"
1,Could not make a good connection with these,"I have crimped many an RJ45 connection in my home. In attempting to patch a new cat5 wire, I tried four times with these Belkin connectors, two on each end, then gave up. I went to Radio Shack and bought new connectors (paying $8 for five). The Radio Shack connectors worked perfectly the first time. I noticed that the wires seemed to slide home more securely in the Radio Shack connectors. They were well worth the extra money to me. Wish I'd just gone to Radio Shack in the first place (no, I'm not connected in any way to Radio Shack!)"
3,A Slight Disappointment,"I am a fan of the entire Pollifax series of books, but ""Mrs. Pollifax and the Golden Triangle"" is by far my least favorite. For some reason, this book just doesn't grab me. It has its share of exotic locales, interesting characters and fascinating plot twists, but it just doesn't hold the attention. Still, I believe it is worth reading for the true Pollifax fan."
5,Wow...... SUPER!!!!!,"I played Shadow Warrior a lot... and what is in this book is great. I love the way Lo Wang talked... It's like real... and with his killing mood as an assassin is all showed.... This is a must read.... especially for Shadow Warrior 3D Games lover.......... And what's good is, there are a lot of Japanese and Chinese Philosophy.. and Wang himself is showed to be good in Physics.... WHO WANTS SOME WANG.......?"
2,Was good while it lasted- but that wasn't for long,Was great while it lasted. The kids were able to use it on their own. The sound and picture quality were fine but after a year it stopped working. The screen kept going in and out and then finally out for good.
5,"So Far, So Good,,,","I wanted a portable DVd player for my flight to Jamaica and after MONTHS of research I finally settled on this one because I got tired of RESEARCHING. I was able to watch 2 1/2 movies on the LONG 5 hr flight. I don't know if I could've watched a full 3 movies on the battery because I fell asleep and my husband turned the player off right before we landed.We did utilize the AC adapter that came with the player to watch movies indoors without using the battery and it worked fine. Nice picture and sound quality.This player served it's purpose and so far, I'm glad that I made the purchase.Oh yeah, mine didn't come with a carrying case or 2 sets of headsets. Was I cheated??"
2,If all you need is a DVD player...,"If all you need is a DVD player, this system is great. The picture quality is nice, the price is low, the design is sleek and the case seems really useful.But that's the problem. The case will only hold the machine securely (or close at all) if the battery is removed. So, if you want to watch in the car and strap the nice case to the seat in front of the kids, the machine has to be plugged in! Doesn't seem very portable. If your children are done watching it by battery and you are ready to put it away, you have to dissemble it to get the case to close. Not really acceptable for me.Also, we have, in the past, hooked the Nintendo up to our portable DVD players. This does have an AV In, but I couldn't get it working. I admit, it may be my cord, but it worked in my last machine. I will likely return this machine and try a different brand."
1,Soft As A Rock,I could have just used a piece of plywood! Hard and thin. And only one not four as implied by listing.
3,Needed work,"Well, this isn't what was expected of Therion when this CD came out. I was expecting alot more than a bunch of hacked up songs thrown onto one CD. It's kind of like saying ""this song is good. and this song is alright but lets put it on there anyway."" If you are going to buy this album, buy it for 'Crowning of Atlantis' and 'Seawinds' Some of the other songs songs were OK but the rest of the album just (...). If you are looking for a more even-flowing album by Therion, buy Vovin. If you are looking for a darker version of Therion, buy Deggial. If you just like the metal, than buy Theli. Each of Therion's albums are great in their own way. I'd have to say most of their albums are pretty much even-flowing throughout but this one just different. Well, Christopher Johnson needs to keep on trying. He's almost got it."
5,"Listen to the good life, hour after hour!","So many great songs on a single cd. I used to have the ""three song minimum"" when looking at cd's (before iTunes). But almost every song on this cd touches my heart and speaks a beautiful message to me.You will enjoy this for years and years to come.David A. Koop, Bestselling AuthorCancer - It's a Good Thing I Got It !: The Life Story of a Very Lucky Man"
5,1 2 3 4 5 6 KIDS,"Wow somebody actually wrote that they didnt like the cd because the sticker on the plastic packaging lied to them. Bear vs. Shark has a great sound, but it's questionable what that sound is. These kinds of bands make me happy, the kind that you can't say ""wow that sounds like (insert band here)"". The singer has this energy in his voice that really brings the band out. Best song, Catamaran or maybe Baraga Engagement."
1,Psychopathic swirls around the drain...,"Although there are a couple of decent tracks (I use the term loosely)on the album, these guys have a LONG way to go. Listning to the CD gave me Deja Vu, I wonder why? Oh, thats because all this stuff has already been done to death by ICP, Twiztid, Blaze, Esham, and ABK.Bottem line, it's not original, it's not edgey, and it's a waste of money. Don't let your your love for Twiztid or ICP cloud your vision when it comes to this one."
1,Waste of Money,"I had this for a week. A week. And it died. Played one time and then died. Dead, dead, dead. Maybe I got a lemon? No amount of coaxing could get it playing again. Had to toss. Might as well placed $200 in the trash. Be warned."
3,Good Picture,Wish it had slow motion. Picture is good if you reduce the preset Brightness level. Well worth the money.
4,good little (?big) player,"I like it so far. I bought it because I thought my old one (only 7 inch screen) had been stolen. Right after I ordered it (before it arrived) I found the other one. When used around the house & garage (no headphones) the sound and picture are so much better than the old one, that I decided to keep it. Battery life seem sto be a little shorter than my old machine, especially if I pause it to leave the room. Also wish it came with a carrying case."
4,"Not So ""New"" English","Meaning five of the seven songs on this EP were already previously released, just not officially. If you've been following Ambulance since their 2004 self-titled debut, you've probably seen most of these songs floating around somewhere on the internet. The only truly new songs on here are the first two, ""New English"" and ""Arbuckle's Swan Song"", both of which are very good.While it's disappointing that we've been waiting almost exactly two years for a release with all new material, every song on here does deserve to see the light of day. ""Country Gentleman"" in my opinion is arguably their best song to date. I just think they should've kept their older unreleased material and their new stuff separate. I do know in addition to a couple other unreleased songs, there were a few b-sides that were only released on a couple of singles that would've been nice to see make it on this EP as well.A nice release though however you choose to look at it. Definitely worth the purchase."
4,Talking to the ground,very different from most of my reading. I had heard of the Long Walk but had no idea how horrendous and the circumstances leading to this.
2,"Important message, badly executed","I wanted to love this book. I'm exploring gastric bypass surgery and this is one of the few books I could find. Dr. Martin, as an MD who has gone through the procedure, has a unique opportunity to give detailed advice from the inside. Unfortunately the advice is not nearly as detailed as I need and the book reads like it was transcribed from an audiotaped lecture by someone with a limited vocabulary. Typos, sentence fragments, paragraphs out of context, mistakes like ""undue lading"" for ""undulating"" and ""peculiar ready"" for ""peculiarity,"" a length of 93 pages in a large double-spaced font ... this book is not nearly ready for prime time. Dr. Martin, write a much longer expanded edition and get a proofreader and editor! I'd especially like to hear more about what to expect post surgery."
5,Spectacular!,"As a reference librarian, I have been waiting for this book for a long time. And this is one of the best reference sources on Africa that I have ever seen. Maybe even THE best. Africana is as comprehensive and scholarly a source on African history and culture, from ancient times to the present and on both sides of the Atlantic, as I guess is possible in one volume. And it is a wonderful source of biographical information on Africans and African-Americans, something reference librarians know can sometimes be hard to find. If your library doesn't have this book, strongly urge them to get it."
1,Calculus I and Calculus II Getting this to work !!!,Getting this cd to work has nothing to do with Calculus..It is old software and is designed for windows 3.1 and windows 95.
5,tkienbaum,"These are nice and sturdy and can take just about anything a toddler can dish out, plus they are so cute"
5,The view of Jesus from the Voice WITHIN Edgar Cayce,".The Voice that passed THROUGH the sleeping body of Edgar Cayce stated that Jesus is the Pattern for the mind to build on.This book literally sets forth that Pattern for the mind.This book, ""There is a River"", and ""The Edgar Cayce Companion"", are the three most important books every written about the work of America's greatest psychic.."
3,good in theory,"the bear was soft and cuddly but the star adoption was not a good idea, lots of paperwork and adds, too much to sign up for that is not wanted or needed just to get the gift."
4,Nice card,"I think VisionTek has some of the better products out there. This card did what I needed it to do, plain and simple. There are better options out there now but I wanted to compliment this card"
3,Good to watch on a cold winter day otherwise don't bother,I gave this film three stars. One star would not be enough as Kate Winslet gave a superb performance otherwise the story is long and sad and gropes to entertain you. I really would have had better things to do if it were a different time of the year but since I watched this film in the dead of winter I rather enjoyed the spatting and the arguing and getting caught up in the era of this show. Watch it for what it is worth and don't expect any thing dramatic.
3,"Fabulous, until part five!","LOVED this so much until the ""part five"". Kate Winslet was amazing as was Guy Pearce. The houses, the restaurants, the clothing, the cars...everything was so spot on. I was in love and couldn't wait until the second DVD arrived. Part Five is horrid. It spends the majority of the time on ""Veda"" who as an adult is played by Evan Rachel Wood, and I really disliked EVERY scene she was in. I was so sick of her voice and her singing and just HER, I just wanted it to be over and the ending is terrible. It felt thrown together after how well thought out and put together the fist four parts were presented."
2,Wayyyyy tooooo slowwww,"This is 5 hours long and feels much longer. It is like sitting in a dr.'s office and thinking you are going to be called every time the nurse comes out. I couldn't help but to day dream while it was playing. In the quest to make this far from Joan Crawford version that it loses most of its charm. Fortunately, I got this at 48 hour video sparing me the cost of buying this mistake."
4,Great movie!,Kate Winslet was perfectly chosen to play the part of Mildred. Does honor to Joan Crawford's original portrayal in the original movie.
2,HBO version of Mildred Pierce in DVD,"We bought this TV retelling of Mildred Pierce from Amazon. We have seen the excellent movie with Joan Crawford many times over the years, and it never fails to hold our interest. In our opinion, the revised version (which may, or may not, be closer to the novel. I really don't know) is not as compelling. It's much too slow moving. As a matter of fact we haven't even bothered to look at the whole thing losng interest by the end of part two. I'd rather look at my DVD of the Joan Crawford film again."
3,Disappointing,"I am sorry but this production cannot hold a candle to the movie starring Joan Crawford. Despite using a fine actress like Kate Winslet it was too long and drawn out to hold my attention, and the ending, well, talk about going out with a whimper!!"
1,JUVENILE PLOT AND JUVENILE WRITING,"This book really lacks the substance of a good thriller. The plot, however unbelieveable, is brought about using such an old, worn, predictable formula that it really doesn't offer much suspense. The characters are brought in like stereotypes and offer little to interest the reader. Villians are surprisingly weak and predictable so that it doesn't offer any suspense when they plot out something nefarious or when they get thwarted by the good guys. The hero and heroine are also from the same mold. A good-looking, bitter and tragic doctor and a young, smart, cold on the outside but hot on the inside type of babe government investigator--hmmm. how unique. Of course the two should fall into bed as soon as they can and the author really doesnt' try to develop anything believeable on this."
5,it was absolutely terrific,"I loved the Reaper. The characters had personaltities that went right along with the plot. I love genetic novels, and this was one of the best. it is second only to Mount Dragon by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. If you thought this book was good, you should read that!"
3,IJet Two-WayTrans Receiver White,"I ordered this item for the purpose of concealing my Ipod in the car. For the most part, it works as indicated but it has a few limitations in the form of lag time from receiver to transponder and powering unit off and on when not in use or when turning off your car. Conclusion: You can ignore its minor flaws for the price and it's RF range."
3,a little dry,I read Stark's book The Rise of Christianity and loved it. This book is much less captivating and more like reading a textbook. I haven't quite finished it for that reason (no pun intended).
2,The Victory of Reason,"This book does not really do justice to the title. The origins of reason in western thought are not adequately explored, with the contributions of Greek philosophers being almost completely ignored. And, even though Dr. Stark touches on the close relationship between faith and reason, he fails to adequately elucidate the nexus between Christ's calling to us as ""brothers"" and the medieval European notion that the world is indeed formed upon principles that our minds are capable of understanding.Also troubling is the author's attempt to credit the unique success of the British to capitalism, rather than to a strong protestant work ethic which persisted in Britain right up to the modern age.In the end, this book offers, not an exposition of the relationship between reason and Christianity, but an attempt to transform capitalism into absolute and salvific truth."
2,Where is San Francisco? Here's the track list.,"This refers to Curb Records CD number D2-77447.Track list:1. My Love2. O' Sole Mio3. The Good Things in Life4. Cute5. Mimi6. London by Night7. On the Sunny Side of the Street8. Let's Do It9. Living Together, Growing Together10. Give Me Love"
2,Lame,"While not as sucky as the first one, it's still full of songs that shouldn't be covered by these bands, or even covered at all. None of these songs stand up to the originals, and a lot of the bands have a ""generic"" sound. (...)"
5,Home... is Where the Heart is,"This album is beautifully done. For those Gathering fans who enjoyed the smooth and melodic sounds of Souvenirs and If-Then-Else, this one will be a great addition. All of the Gathering albums are fantastic in their experimentation of genre, poignant song messages, and the hypnotizing vocals of Anneke. This album is experimental in the ambient sense. There is not much aggressive guitar work but rather a lot of serene vocals by Anneke and alternative/electronic progression by the band. Its a great creative effort that shows the many colors and talents of this group."
2,not any good,i don't understand some reviewers on here its like did we here the same cd or something.
4,Moving further away from their roots!,"With each new release the Gathering move away from their Goth metal days and more into a mainstream sound.This release continues down that path. They have always had beautiful textures in their music and with Anneke's amazing vocal delivery, the end result was usually something pretty special. What we have here is once again texture laden tones wonderfully woven together to create a peaceful listening experience. Long gone are the heavy guitars and the heavier sound. This has been replaced for at least the last 10 years buy a more mellower yet fuller sound if that makes sense?If you've enjoyed the bands music the last 10 years or so?, this cd will no doubt satisfy your craving for their special blend of music.Anneke's departure is a pretty devastating blow to this bands overall sound as her voice was the glue that made this sound work. However life goes on and I'm sure they'll find decent replacement. Having said that, I will be a monumental task indeed!"
4,Four Freshmen Live in Holland,"Well,their back..!! Still keeping that close harmony The Freshmen did back in the 50's.Wonder why Bob Flannigan has not caught up with the Stan Kenton Alumni Band headed by Mike Vax,to cut a recording with todays Four Freshmen?This session would be worth listning to."
5,Donald Trump doll,"I bought this for my boss for his bday. Have yet to see his reaction; but it says 17 saying and because we're celebrity apprentice junkies, it is a lot of fun. Good present for a boss (just make sure he doesn't use it on you) :)"
3,Seems to have been written before the game was released.,"This book seems to have been written well before the game was released. They make numerous references to fire prevention, which should have been changed to Prefectures. Overall, the book is good, but minor things like that drag the star rating down a little."
5,Professional - The Complex Made Understandable,"Connell is the consumate professional / teacher. He takes a complex subject and walks you through it in a way that is fun, understandable, real world, and complete. His book is so good that you dont realize just how much you have learned until you finish and look back. The style reminds me of my very best top notch university instructors. Someone knew the stuff so well, they knew could separate the wheat from the chaff and could effortlessly present the material in a rational and logical manner. If you ever had a professor like that - you will immediately know what I mean when you read this book. I have never taken the time to write an on-line (or off-line) comment before but had to for this professional work. ITs nice to see books that are presented for real world situations."
1,Useless code.,"If you are interested in designing a front end for a database don't waste your time looking for ideas in this book. The code, predominantely DAO oriented, is riddled with errors. Even if you download it from wrox.com you will find out that it is unworkable. I'd hate to see one of his so called 'professional' apps."
5,"Clear, concise, to the point","Bar none, this is the best VB book I have ever read. It's clear in a class room style. All of the points are well thought out and presented. Dang Good."
2,"If you do not have VB background, do not buy this book!","If you do not have any background on VB and ACCESS, you should not buy this book! What's more, you need to have considerable knowledge on VB to really understand what the author is talking about!The author's writing style is basically for those middle-level persons in VB programming, not for beginners. For those wanting to learn VB, I strongly suggest you to buy books written by by John Smiley"
1,Much chaff; very little wheat.,"If C/C++ programmers need any more reasons to dislike VB, this book will provide one. It's incredibly wordy and repetitious - I really believe the author was paid by the word. I've read introductory books on other languages with no complaints, but this is different. I don't need to be repeatedly re-assured that setting property values in design mode means I'm a real programmer. Wading through page after page of BS trying to glean bits of truly useful information got so frustrating that I finally gave up and stuck with on-line docs.I really don't understand how this book came to be so raved over. Petzold it's not, that's for sure. I can't help but think that if the author had stuck strictly to disseminating technical information in a concise manner ( a la Petzold, for instance) that the information in these 800+ pages could have been contained in a 20 page pamphlet."
3,examples for MS Access,"I haven't finished reading the entire book. This is my opinion thus far: The book only discusses interfacing VB6 to Microsfot Access databases. It does not get into Oracle, or other databases. Seems to have a lot about ADO, and some DAO."
5,"Excellent , just excellent !!","I don't really know why the others don't rate the book as it should be - five stars! Are they really programmers or pretenders ? I am writing this review because I'm really impressed at what I can do now with VB programming! Imagine that one can create a SQL tester so simple with few less codes and even a maintenance program complete from data entry, find , delete and modify without heavy coding! I previously attended tutorial courses just to create applications that uses access databases, but the teaching techniques and programming techniques does not easily stick to mind until I got a hold of this book. Now I can even use our Sybase server to create applications, thanks to Mr. Connell."
1,Even Connell's own (downloaded) projects don't work!,"If you hang with this book, you'll discover that after Chapter 9, almost none of Connell's projects work. You'll get cryptic error messages when you attempt to run the projects you coded. After spinning wheels, you'll download and extract Connell's corresponding project and discover that it will not work either. This book is so replete with errors that it is a waste of time, not to mention money."
5,Great gift for any Get Fuzzy reader,"I got this for my wife who is also a GF fan, and she loves it. This collection has a lot of older strips, and the art has changed significantly since then. Good coffee table fodder.I don't know if Conley does this with the covers for all of his collections, but he pays a little homage to fellow cartoonist Stephan Pastis (Pearls Before Swine) by including Rat (a main character from ""Pearls"") as the pilot of the airplane flying behind Bucky and Satchel. Another GF collection, ""Scrum Bums,"" has the name ""DILBERT"" written down the side of a rugby ball on the cover.Yes, I'm a dork."
2,Huh?,"I guess I must agree with some of the principles he has in his book. Some are a little confusing if you aren't educated in money lingo. I must say I'm tired of authors using ""middle"" income brackets as their examples. $54,000???? As a teacher, I'll be lucky to see that much in 35 years."
1,Bad advice from an angry financial planner,"This book sounds like the author is angry at index funds for siphoning off some of his commissions. His advice on investing in index funds (not) goes against most financial wisdom. He keeps repeating that these funds don't really beat the S & P 500 as they claim. What he doesn't mention is that most are within a percentage point or less of of matching the S&P. That's why people continue to invest in them. He also claims most funds will beat index funds in a down market. Oh yeah? Maybe he'd like to look at Janus Mercury, Janus 20, Fidelity Megellan etc. etc. etc for the last fiscal year. I could go on and on but you get the picture. Other advice I could get from my father or the man on the street i.e. don't spend too much on a wedding. Really? How insightful. If you must, check this out at the library, but don't waste your money on it. That's one of the ""New Rules"" you won't find in his book."
3,so slow country music,"I never heard Jeff Carson before and i expect something more of him.This is a real slow music album,perhaps is not bad for a moment of relax,but I think there's nothing bad in two or three faster songs.Personally I don't like it too much"
4,Good and useful,"This is very useful for using with the a-max mcd 380 mp3 player, because it allows you not to write definitively on a cd-r, but it is not available in France, and I can't buy it with amazon.com."
1,Slightly interesting premise... falls flat after that,"I was given this book as a gift, so I forced myself to slog through this book, hoping there would be some light at the end of this brick. From a slightly interesting premise of a quirky group of software developers, this book spirals downward quickly into a bizarrely unintelligible plot, many waste-of-space diversions that seem to just be there to make the book look thicker, laughable attempts at sounding twentysomething (""I'm going to download some jifs"") -- and the key indicator that Coupland has truly jumped the shark -- writing himself into his own story. Poorly."
3,Ummm...oookay.,"I was mildy enjoying this book until I reached the random sections in it where Coupland almost seems to be plugging his own previous work, Generation X. I was confused by this. Why is he using comments in his own book like, ""this seems like something characters in a douglas coupland novel would be doing""? It was so dumb to me, really. It's not ingenious or anything. It really turned me off to the book, and made him seem downright lame...not witty."
5,"First real kiss of ""Mulder"" and ""Scully""","There are 9 seasons of ""The X Files"", but it is in the 7th season when ""Mulder"" and ""Scully"" have they first real kiss. There are some ""fun episodes"" that they are fun and interested, but you can have the ""serious"" episodes too."
3,Music seems Ok,The whole series of albums feature specific effect on our brain which is similar or close to the beneficial use of herb. I found the Ginko Biloba great(I mean the music not the effect) But the Ginsen and Kava Kava was dissapointing.
2,plinky plonk,"i was drawn to this release out of fascination for the name. not only doesthe plinky plonk work out have nothing to do with 'kava kava' it is some what offensive to my ears when people bother to commercially release this kind of supermarket/lift/whatever it is music and shroud it in mysticism and pseudo occult 70s nonsense. on the other hand it is well played and all that but much more recommended are the english pop band kava kava who fuse club, funk and psychedelic styles. they may not be as relaxing as the herb but at least their polished fusion is original and thought provoking"
5,Good book,"I would recommend this book to anyone. Even if you think you don't like reading about history, you'll like this book. In fact, it is books like these that are the reason I love history so much, and why I'm majoring in it. It isn't about the politics or the wars or whatever else (although those are certainly important), it is the story of a woman trying to survive through a hell most of us cannot even imagine has existed on this earth, especially not in the last 50 years. Peoples' lives are what connect us to the past, and what make it relevant to the future. It gives a little meaning and heart behind all the dates and events that you have to memorize in class...make them more personal. And furthermore, you will be inspired by this woman. Her strength and character is admirable, to say the very least. Actually, I don't think even a fictional writer could invent a heroine more honorable than this one.So please, read it. stories like these deserve to be shared."
5,Glad I found this,"I was frustrated that my cable company dropped one of our PBS channels and bought a digital converter for one of my analog TV sets. This A/B switch makes it easy to switch back and forth between cable and antenna. Cost for this item, less than $10.00 w/shipping; not having to pay Comcast additional monthly fees for PBS access - PRICELESS!"
4,Could have been better,"Overall a good book about a new approach to VB Business Objects. But, like so many of these types of books, it seems that there was an effort to break the 700 page barrier. The author would always present a way of solving a problem only to explain in a later chapter why it was the wrong approach. If he focused on his optimal solution and why that was the best, then the book would have been about half as long. Maybe this helps people, but it seems like fluff to me. There are also holes in the implementation provided, most notably with regard to deleting persistent objects."
3,"Good concepts, poor presentation","First of all, this book is a great buy for a VB beginner and it offers few great tricks to handle business objects in VB. For myself, I've learned much from this book (even I've read many VB books). However, things I noticed while reading, this book has bad layout and presentation of code examples. Also, Author seems to have a grasp from the subject, but he falls down with repetitive writing which results to 'fat book'. Applying the summary of 'Code so far' instead of partial code examples, this book would have been much better. Finally, this book is not a reference book; if you want to learn business objects, you have to sit down and concentrate to keep up with author's subject.If you want to learn the basics of business objects, buy this one. If you want to find a reference book or more professional approach, look for something else."
3,It is okay - but will look for a better kit in the future,My boys plays with a more substantial kit at school. I thought this product would measure up to the same level. It didn't.
3,WOW,"Perhap I expected too much from this cd, although the music was not bad.I didn't notice any prodfound effect"
1,The most ignorant trash I've touched with my bare hands...,I never want to have to look at this garbage again...
1,A joke,"This item is a joke and waste money. This item did not come with a power cord and the battery does not have the power to power my guitar, and it come with any type paper work to help you with. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!"
1,A substandard effort,"This Arcadia entry seems to have been hurriedly tossed together. The pictures are far from compelling (see the cover for an example), the text is minimal, and the captions are very basic. While I am not an expert on Rochester's baseball heritage, I hope it fulfills a need for local fans."
1,Low Performance FootBath,Essentially this product just bubbles. The bubbles don't soothe. I find no significant improvement from using a regular pan.Pros:-light weight-well designed carry handleCons:Water does NOT stay warm as advertised-bubbles only make a mess-not worth the cost
1,Awful,I got this and played it. 2 hours my ass it lasted maybe 29 mins and the first 5 mins was a comercial for there record. The instructor sucked
4,"Well made dvd, but I'm a klultz","I love the dvd - Annette Maria has a great presence, the dvd is beautifully broken down and indexed and the steps are fresh and new. Having said all that, I can't get the jump roping down. I use a 9' rope and I'm 5'8. I keep tripping over the darn thing. I can't manage anything more than the basic steps.I gave the dvd 4 stars because it IS a well-made dvd with lots of new ideas to help keep jumping rope from being boring. I'm fairly active (I do FIRM aerobic dvds daily) and just couldn't do this."
3,Not as good as previous albums,"I love Komeda, like I love few musical groups, but this one fell short of my expectations. Pop Pa Svenska, The Genius of Komeda, and What Makes It Go? are both very different albums, but both great in their own way, and this one, while a little different (the synth player left I understand), it just doesn't hook me like the others.Probably the only song I still play is BLOSSOM, but that's an earlier song, and they just redid it for this record. It's an okay record, but get ""What Makes It Go"" and ""The Genius of Komeda"" first, in that order if you're curious about Komeda."
3,Review of health promotion interventions in Latino populations,"I purchased this book to acquire a better understanding of sexual and reproductive health promotion interventions used in Latino populations and to write a grant application for a study we want to do. While the content was worth reading for background, most of the case studies cited are not recent. Thus, good information to become grounded in the topic, but not useful in writing a grant application to conduct a current study."
1,Not happy,"The fob pictured is not the fob I received.When you put up an picture of an item, shouldn't you get that very item?"
4,its a book,"i don't want to say that neil gaiman is overrated, but neil gaiman is overrated. This book is good, yes, maybe even great, but it is by no means the most intelligent and mindexpanding thing you will ever read. The way gaiman strings together his sandman universe is magnificent, but I felt that this story had something lacking. the use of religous icons from other cultures was great, the interlude story about the boy in the boarding house was cool. As for Gaiman's theories about hell and its purpose, that's just his opinion and it wasn't very insightful to me. But this is a good sandman book, as sandman books go, and if you are a gaiman or sandman fan it won't kill you to pick this baby up."
2,Lame art with half-baked story,"If seeing Lucifer, Thor , Angels, demons and so on is enough for you , ok, but for me end of story was dissapointing and predictable, and pencils were AWFUL!"
3,"Initially intriguing, then somewhat tedious","When I initially recieved this book, I devoured it, so happy to find a book that addresses my feelings as a new mother. However, the author frequently refers to the ideas of other experts and authors, and fails to provide her opinion with respect to same. I preferred hearing her ideas and opinions, and became disenchanted when the book began to read more like a compilation of other authors'/experts' theories, especially since I had already identified with the author's voice, and was unfamiliar with these other individuals. The book is certainly easy reading, but my enthusiasm for reading it had diminished by the middle of the book, so that it has now become a chore to complete."
4,Who done it and Why did they do it?,"Stith does a very plausible rendition of a massive kidnapping of an entire island. Thecharacters are clear, real and engaging. The story moves quickly and is very entertaining.Good excitement, reasonable science and lots of fun to read. My first exposure to Stith, Ihave already bought another based on the quality of this book."
4,Longer chain would be nice.,This is a beautiful pearl necklace. My husband ordered it for me for Christmas. Upon opening it I saw that the chain had not been secured allowing for a huge tangled mess of the chain. It took about 30 minutes and two straight pins to gently untangle the chain. The chain would be a better fit for me if it was 18 inches long. It sits a bit high but that will allow me to wear my silver heart necklace with it. I would buy it again. It is VERY pretty!!!!!
2,Not user friendly,"I have used many correction tape dispensers without a problem. Even generic brands were easy to use. The tape twists and when it does go on straight, I have to push it down with my finger to make it stick. It shipped promptly and the price was great but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Been following since '90 in Harvard Square,"I first heard Martin singing and playing guitar on the streets of Harvard Square in 89 or 90, and then in Johnny D's in Somerville, MA a few years later, and I liked him so much I bought one of his home recorded cassettes - the talent was just amazing. His sweet, powerful voice with it's honky-tonk, bluesy overtones, and his excellent Chicago swing-blues guitar style come through on every song, whether it's a real swing-blues style (Thirteen Step Boogie) or something a little folksier. I'm honestly NOT a fan of folk music, and I don't think Martin fits that genre's description well, but by breaking the mold he has really held my interest through the years."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this photo frame. I, and others who know more about technology than I do, were unable to get the pictures to repeat. I called techno support and they had to call me back because the representative was not certain what to tell me to do. When he returned the call, it was not helpful at all. I had been waiting for this gift to myself. I am a teacher and wanted to start off my new school year with this frame on my desk to look at loved ones throughout the day. I'm returning it. The manual is not helpful at all and I just could not get what I needed to make the frame do anything. The remote control was a joke. I could not tell if it was on or not. I would not recommend this frame and I really wanted to."
2,Distorted,I find it hard to believe that this frame does not display a standard photo with the appropriate letterboxing to keep it from being distorted. My 4x3 photos don't even show properly in the 4x3 view. I saw other people's reviews that suggested resizing the photos so they would display correctly. That is an incredible amount of trouble to go through and that's if you know how to do it (which I do). There should really be an option to turn expansion to the size of the frame off.
2,Keep shopping,"I ordered 7 of these frames based on price and the good reviews I read. The idea was a simple Christmas solution that would suit everyone on my list. Once the frame arrived the first thing I noticed is that there are no instructions on how to download pictures. Very frustrating. Once the pictures were loaded I noticed that the quality leaves much to be desired. The frame only holds about 10 pictures and a memory card is needed after that. NOTE: You will need to load the memory card with pictures before using it in the frame. You cannot load pictures to it directly, once it's in the frame. Again, frustrating since the memory card the frame needs is different from my camera and it will not fit my laptop. I now have to find a way to get the pictures on the card. Again, frustrating. Frame $70.00 plus dollars. Memory card $19.99. Memory card reader $45.00. My sanity....priceless...and gone."
1,No Directions,"I've got two gripes with this product. First, it shipped much later than I expected. Second, the directions are so poor, that I still haven't figured how to get pictures to display on the screen."
4,Feng Shui quick healers: easy tips to healthier living,"This is wonderfully formatted. Easy to read. A joy to implement. It highlights many different means of cleansing yourhome, and enhancing the chi. I was really impressed with the essence section. Building an altar and dedicating the space wasalso covered. Along with the basics - analyzing your space, grounding, clearing negative, and invigorating your environment; it also touches on colors; the placement of objects & furniture, and orientation & alignment for your best interests. Very pleasant book.I would recommend this for anyone just finding Feng Shui.Thank You."
3,improbable fantasy!,"The first thing I want to say about Forge of the Elders is that it is way out! I mean, like in way, way out there, man!A cross between known SF & unexplored fantasy, improbable circumstances piled upon improbable dialogue & a whimsical air and as I read I found myself looking over my shoulder to make sure I was still sitting in my own chair, in my own home.Not my cup of tea, however, hard for me to remember what went on chapter to chapter because of the unreality of what might be, what might have been & what might happen. I found myself lost as I wandered into this maelstrom of characters that absolutely bored me to tears! Don't get me completely wrong! It has some good laughs with improbable circumstances piled upon improbable dialogue & a whimsical air.A likely stocking stuffer!"
2,water damage,"I would like to have know that the book i bought had water damage, pages mildewed together, and pages falling out. the book itself is very interesting."
5,dick is it?,"dick, yur parents gave you the right name. lmao There is no difference between natural and supernatural its just a matter of how ppl perceive. There are a lot of things on earth that can solidify the possibility of fairies and whatever else. Ra is just touching on what has been obvious for him, nothing that is said by Ra is new. Well, maybe his sphere system, well, to me anyway. I reccomend Muata Ashby's work for those who cannot understand Ra Un Nefer Amen's approach."
3,Poetry?,"I really don't know what to say but that this book wasn't exceptionally good nor such a bad book, because at times it makes me think of my teenage years. She isn't good at imagery nor at poetry itself (comparing her to other authors) but it is good enough for a teen to feel connected with others."
3,"Good work, awesome heart!","Jewel's work as a singer/songwriter astounded me. Simply put, this book of poetry had me enthralled. The heart behind each of the poems is so real and sincere. I didn't want to put it down."
3,Real life; prolific,"Since reading ""A Night..."", I have not only expanded my own poetry writing but have grown to respect Jewel's outlook on the simple things in life. She is able to express these views not only through her music but in her writing as well. She is on her way to becoming one of the most prolific songwriters and poets in years to come."
1,"If you're a white, North American woman between 12 and 15,","then you may like this book because you'll find something to relate to. If you read poetry regularly, you will find this writing valueless. If you are a Jewel fan, this is a must. If you are not, then you will realize, of course, that only her rock-star status enabled her to publish this drek. As a humorist and a musician in a band that will never achieve pop stardom, I see this as a source of satire. Try this: read one of the poems outloud with as much emotion as you can, while trying not to laugh. It's not easy."
1,"I guess I must be shallow, for I HATE this book.","If you like this book, then you must be shallow, because you think there's ACTUAL meaning to any of her poetry. Sound familiar?! That's the cry of any intelligent person who's ever read a REAL book of poetry. If I ever read this book again, I'm gonna into cardiac arrest, and someone's gonna have to give me CPR. This book makes me despise her even more. Not only can she NOT sing, but she can't write either!"
4,Thought provoking yet confusing.,I read some of the poems in Jewel's book and was a little confused but awed at the same time.She gives vivid accounts of experiences and feelings that no one else even mentions.I think this is a great example of openness and as such should be read with an open mind.
4,Give this girl a break,"As an Alaska-lite, I feel that until you have lived in this town of beauty and extraordinary sentiment, you need to understand that there are things like poerty and literature that inspire free expression and insight that are related to our own life experiences. For those who cannot relate to Jewel's depth of emotion, you really need to visit the great state to understand more. I give Jewel credit for putting Alaska on the map. If this book gives younger readers a taste for poetry, then all's well that ends well."
1,Pretty bad.,"A person's poetry is something very personal, so I really don't want to bash this too hard. It reads like ok high school poetry that sometimes dips down to sappy, pretentious high school poetry. It's hard to compare this to another famous poet as it's not really on that level. If you're a Jewel fan and you're not into serious poetry, go for it. Otherwise I'd check out some ""real"" poetry."
1,Mediocre naivety.,"So many of the reviews posted here have either blasted or gushed over Jewel. I hope my review cannot be described as either. Jewel generally writes mediocre poetry. I write poetry myself and I wouldn't pretend that it is the most talented work out there. She can't seem to write any better than I do...which is just not good enough for a published ""poet"". I agree with the reviewer who asked of those who described A Night without Armor as ""the best book of poetry ever"" - What they were comparing it to! No one can be so naive as to believe that her publisher didn't think her musical success wouldn't also translate to literary success. If literary is the word. Regardless of the quality of the poetry, the book would never have been a failure."
2,"Jewel's work seems shallow, childish","Jewel's poetry is too like her song lyrics--somewhat childish and lacking in literary excellence. Certainly her work would never have been published without her celebrity standing; it is a well-intentioned attempt at deepness and intellectualism that falls short of either. On the other hand, poetry is as much about the reader as it is about the writer, and if Jewel's audience finds her work insightful and full of hope, then perhaps it has not gone entirely to waste."
1,Her work is no Jewel,This is the furthest thing from poetry that I have ever seen. If this book has anything is that it shows Jewel for what she is- a bold bimbo.
1,Blake? hardly!,"Jewel has imagery in her poems alright- her breasts. I was shocked that the majority of her poems deal with her breasts, her sexuality, and drugs. It's sad to see that eager readers are turning to this trash instead of reading some real poetry. Yes, real. her ""poetry"" is no more than a bunch of cliches. I am sorry that I bought this book. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
5,"I love Jewel's work, I wish i could meet her, best ever","I read Shakespeare and Poe, but neither of them move me or touch me like Jewel does. her poems, her songs, just her voice itself, makes my soul lift to the sky. She is a master of word and language, and I wish i could meet her just to shake her hand and let her know how much her writing and songs move me. Without Jewel, I would always be depressed. Jewel lifts me up with her writing and songs, lifts me up out of that to where I am happy. The mere sound of her voice makes my heart flutter. She is the most beautiful person I have ever seen, and her works have more meaning to me than anyone I've ever met. It's hard to say your in love with someone you've never met, but I can say I am in love with jewel, for her work touches me more than anything I've ever read, with exception to the Bible."
1,Jewel has unwittingly written poetry's answer to Spinal Tap.,"This is pretentious garbage that is an insult to legitimate poets who struggle for publication but lack the celebrity privilege thrust upon the likes of Jewel. It is the height of arrogance that Jewel actually takes this mess seriously. Such amateurish drivel can only be read as a parody of stuffy poetry, literature's answer to ""Spinal Tap."""
1,Poetaster Laureate,"I agree wholeheartedly with the last writer (""A Reader"" from ""A Place""). What must it be like to be a real poet watching this celebrity-penned koob climb the charts? Kids, pay attention: you're allowed to like this stuff if you want, ""applaude"" it if you must, but IT'S NOT POETRY. As a public service I will now name a few genuine poets whom you might check out: Elizabeth Bishop, John Berryman, William Butler Yeats, Gary Snyder, John Ashbery, Paul Muldoon, Seamus Heaney, Louise Gluck, Michael Ondaatje,C.K. Williams. Would somebody please explain to me why Jewel gets approx. 200 reviews on the amazon.com web page, and most of these people are virtually ignored?"
2,California Exotics Rabbit,This rabbit was really fantastic but it quit working after I had only used it twice.The controls broke and it would not even turn on.
3,Good music but a lack of quality of the recording,"I love good songs, military or not, and I recognize that this is a good collection of military german songs. I have some of these songs recorded in the 80's and the 90's and the big difference is the quality of recording because the quality of this recording is not perfect even if it has been remastered. However, in this collection, there are 6 different CD regarding the Wehrmacht, the panzer, the Kriegmarine, the Luftwaffe and so on and if you wish to find the widest collection of German military songs from the 1933-1945 period, it is a good choice."
2,Landser Marches,"The CD was somewhat disappointing in that I had other recordings of German military music that were much better in sound quality. Some of the music tracks were VERY poor, worse than on other CDs I've purchased. I also thought that the music would be along the lines of German soldiers singing marching songs, soldatenlieder so to speak. There was very little of that. The music was authentic and did have some good recognizable tunes."
3,A little bit disapointed,"First time I listened to J-Rock I thought all the groups were cool. But I was a little bit disapointed with Luna Sea. All their songs sound exactly the same. They don't change their style or the feeling inside the song. You might get bored after listening this CD twice.I recommend you to buy this CD or any other by Luna Sea if you like groups that sound the same in every single and song. Also if you are their fan. It's not a bad group, only a simple one, nothing unique in their songs. Their best song is ""TRUE BLUE"", the only one that seems to be ""REALLY COOL"".It's an average group. That's all."
5,Splendid,"Blind Blake's guitar style has been very influencial in the history of the blues and this album has many of his best tracks on it. It is certainly easier to listen to than the old vinyl release. I guess that noise reduction stuff works to some extent. I know that the master recordings were lost long ago and this was taken from production 78's. So with that in mind, the sound quality is probably as good as it's going to get. The music is just simply fabulous!"
5,A legendary pianist!,"Haskill was one of the masters pianists in order to play Mozart. She was not merely colorist; she emphatizes that caleidoscopic world that Mozart impplies. His touch is velvet; and knows how to make floating the melody ; she owned the gift of produce a dyonisiac sound of W.A.M. without affection , or theatrical rapture sense.His Chopin keeps the charm, elegance and nuance given by the last romantic tradition. Think in von Sauer, Cortot or Martin Krause , by instance. She'll never give us a dirty play; his sense of how the music must sound is organical; and you can feel the beat sense even in the most lyrical phrases.This album is essential for you. It will let you know once more to understand Haskill was the favorite of Fricsay and Markevitch in other Mozart Concerts, and yet why she was choosen by Artur Grumiaux as his musical partner in Mozart violin sonatas. She was requested too by Pau Casals in several Prades Festvals.After all these proofs, do you need another one ?"
5,Great read!,"This is a excellent book to help your dating skills in ""The Sims Hot-Date"". It provides very useful information about how to act downtown, what to do, how to act on a date, what to say, and basically anything you need to know inorder to succeed.It contains a section about the Hot-Date EP as well as an Introduction to the Sims. Some people might find the intro a little repetitive but again, it also gives very helpful tips on how to succeed in the regular house as well.Overall it is a great book for reference for the game. You won't be disappointed. Pick it up, and if you do, youll be dating and marrying the whole town!"
3,beautiful gown hair needs improvement,"Love the dress but the hair is plastered to her head, very hard not soft. the box's background is bland, just silver not much to look at, which is fine if you plan on taking it out the box."
4,PHANTASM Series,"This particular one wasn't the sphere but I was told that before the transaction when through. However, box set I did get was in great condition and the discs had no cosmetic problems at all. Phantasm is always a good classic to throw in, I just wish they would finish the 5th one. Doesn't look like that is going to happen either."
5,Belkin product rock!,This y cable can be used with a vga to hdmi cable in order to get sound to your tv from your pc. You will have to have the appropriate sound and video cards to ensure that these work though.
1,Wrong brand -- Beware,"Like other people who reviewed this item, I found that this isn't a Belkin splitter. It's some cheapo brand like what I was trying to replace! Not very happy with the false advertising, but also like another reviewer wrote, there isn't much point in returning something that cost $2+."
3,"Just a cable, nothing to write home about","This cable is functional, but nothing to write home about, most of these cheaper cables are just fine, they do the job, but not really high quality. But works great for plugging in the phone or computer to stereo."
3,ordered this but had to return the item i got it for,"I would guess that this works fine. it is a good brand name. i just had no use for it when i returned the software i bought to use it with so i returned it at the same time. i am giving it 3 stars only because there is no ""neutral"" rating."
2,Get what you pay for....,"I ordered this product and recieved it and immediatly was upset. My test band for speaker wires is the Beatles, nearly any song by them has parts which are omitted when i have a faulty wire.Perhaps this is a unique situation and normally this is a good cord but mine did not work.I'm going to buy this.SANOXY Quality 25 ft Shielded 3.5mm Stereo Y Adapter to 2 Rca's Cable 22 awg for Connecting Laptops/mp3 Players to Home Receivers or Other Devices Accepting Rca'sone as a replacement, i'll let you know how it is when it comes"
2,Works great as long as it's sitting still,"This cable works exactly as it should until it gets jostled in any way. If it even gets brushed against the audio suddenly distorts horribly with lots of pops and scratches. As long as you're just going to use this in some home audio setup where it'll sit out of sight, out of mind it's fine, but if it's anything you want to use with a laptop/portable device that you're going to want to pick up and keep using while it's plugged in, I'd think twice."
4,Superb Value,I highly recommend the Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter mini-plug / 2 RCA.PROS:1. Durable medium-duty connectors.2. Acceptable sound quality. (Good for what it is)3. Well insulated wiring.CONS:1. No velcro strap.I would pay $0.30 more for a velcro strap to help maintain a sense of organization and prevent 'bird's nests'. A strap would allow you to throw it in a bag w/out having it unravel. Tying electronic wires like a strand of rope isn't the best way to preserve wiring.
4,nice,shipped and works as promised... my neighbors are gonna hate Pandora now that my surround sound is hooked up to the computer ;)
1,Never received the product!!!,"I was waiting for for 2 weeks, I never received the product. I will never going to buy again for this provider. Thanks God it was only 12 dlls bill."
3,"bad connection! falls out easily, makes noise on movement","never thought I would write a review of a cable, but here we are. I'm bummed! I wanted this cord to connect my stereo to my laptop, which I move around the couch with me. unfortunately, the 3.5 mini connection (the laptop end) is very poorly made on this cable. slight movements are enough to make the cable slip a bit out of the laptop port and stop working. even smaller movements will cause fuzzing buzzing noises to emanate from the speakers.the sound quality is fine, though. if you're not moving your input source around, then this is an acceptable cheap cable. but if you're using a laptop or ipod, then this cable is aggravating."
2,only lasted for 6 months,"low quality, i mainly used it to connect my ipod to the stereo, after 6 months of occasional usage, sound wouldn't pass from this cable, very disappointed and angry i pulled it out of my stereo and cut it in half then tossed it in the trash."
5,"Easy to use, great price","We received this splitter in the mail within a couple days of ordering. It worked great to connect my macbook to my flat screen television, so I could connect it to play itunes movies from my laptop. The sound quality was great and it was a great price too."
3,Its a splitter,I haven't had any problems with this splitter but then again I didn't expect any. If you need a splitter this one seems reliable I would recommend it.
2,Didn't last long...,"I bought this micro-plug-to-RCA adapter and gave it to my sister. The first time we used it it started losing contact. The problem was where the microplug plugged into the computer. For a while jiggling the wire a bit re-established contact. That was in the summer, and she didn't use it again until Christmas, when the problem got worse and worse and finally I had to toss this product and buy a new, sturdier adapter."
5,Works like a champ,Works right out of the package. It arrived quickly and safely. No problems. Sounds great and was a value for the price.
5,Exactly what i needed.,Was looking for something to connect my phone to my home theater system since it doesn't have a audio-input. This cable fixed that flaw. Good quality cable for cheap!
3,Great idea -- but not perfect,"I had been looking for a shirt like this for a long time. Wearing this shirt allows you to wear whatever nursing bra you like, while still enjoying the comfortability of nursing with a covered tummy. This is sometimes a nice option if you don't want to wear a nursing bra tank. Moreover, you get to wear all your pre-pregancy clothes instead of special nursing shirts. Yay! Back to a big (or at least bigger) wardrobe!What would make this shirt better: I found that this tank top was too long. I am only 5'3"" so that might be why. But it is quite long. The material is also quite dense so even if you want to tuck it in, it's too bulky to do so comfortably. I wish that the material was softer and lighter, more appropriate for layering and to serve as an undershirt.It'd be great if they could do a redesign. Please?"
2,Ok but short,"I am tall and big in the middle, the shirt was very short. I didn't wear it as much as I thought I would. Plus the holes for the breast didn't line up with my breast and lines showed through my cloths. Was easier to just wear a cami."
3,Installed First Time with Win2K,"This Creative ModemBlaster V.92 Modem installed first time and automatically with Win2K. When I booted the system, it came up as already installed! No need to go through the driver installation procedure. It consistently gets 48kbps for downloads and I see bursts of 100 - 150kbps for web site pages.I noticed that Win2K was using one of its generic drivers to run the modem and thought, ""Let's upgrade to the latest driver from Creative Labs."" Well, that turned out to be a mistake. After installing the driver, the system restarted and then locked up in the Windows 2000 startup screen. I had to restart again, press F8, and then pick last known good configuration to restart the computer. Win2K restarted with the old generic driver and everything is working fine again.I bought this modem after returning the Best Products equivalent product because Win2K didn't recognize it after several attempts to get it installed, to no avail."
2,Enough with the Blowhards Already,"I knew we were off to a bad start when the first words uttered in this documentary (by some guy in a green-star spangled sweater that I'd never heard of) were ""Music wouldn't be what it is today without Frank Zappa."" First off, most modern music is crap and it's not nice to blame Frank, secondly this is the most overused cliche in music critique. Especially when dealing with rock. So, the film plods on with some quasi-academic, English ""experts"" seemingly forever until Jimmy Carl Black finally appears. I must admit that the interviews with J.C.B. , Bunk Gardner, Don Preston and Kim Fowley are interesting enough. However, the bulk of this DVD is endless chatter from self-important know-it alls and very little footage of The Mothers. It would be much nicer to see actual footage than listen to these talking heads for 2 + hours. The Mothers deserve better than this. Save your money!!"
3,"Eh, its ok","Honestly, there is a lot of good information here and some great footage. That being said it drags along. Not nearly as bad as music in review but its along those lines. Were it not for the footage it would be horrid."
1,Stunningly Bad,"Sorry gang but this truly is awful on almost every level. For those expecting new or substantive footage - especially of live performances - be prepared to sit through 2+ hours and get NOTHING.The overwhelming bulk of this dvd is given over to self important Brits and other marginal ""experts"" pontificating - boringly and often outright wrongly - about FZ and MOFO. Trust me - I was there from the start - this captures none of the energy or power of the music or the moment.The only saving grace is the recent inteview footage with Jimmy Carl Black. He's a gem. But the rest? ZZZZZ....Frank would have hated it."
5,Quite simply the most beautiul men I've seen,"After buying the 2004 edition I thought to myself how can the 2005 get any better I mean for the past few months I couldnt get my eyes off the screen every time I watched the 2004 edition. The men in this new 2005 version are gorgeous, the way they're shot, the poses and overall style has made my mouth water after just 5 minutes of watching it. It seems to me like this series keeps on getting better and better every year. I'm planning on buying both as a gift for my friends birthday later this year!I cannot wait what these beautiful french athletes look like in the 2006 version, I've allready pre-ordered the calendar!"
2,Could have been a great read but ended up pretty cheesy.,"Kilo Class should have been a fun read but was bogged down by black-and-white characters, ludicrous 'coincidences,' and dialog reminiscent of the bad-guy-who-gives-away-the-entire-plot-to-the-good-guy-just-before-he-escapes.The book was set up very well -- a truly believeable threat to the good old USA. But it quickly lost all of its realism to the point where I didn't care who 'won.'*sigh* Off to find another author. I don't think I could sit through another one of these."
1,I wish I had the money back I paid for this book,"Mr. Robinson obviously knows little of the military and even less of the Middle East. As a career Naval Officer I found his lack of technical knowledge distracting. Even with this limitation, if Mr. Robinson was a better writer the story might be more engaging. The characters are shallow, predictable, and very unbelievable. Had I not been stuck in an airport overnight with nothing else to read, I would not have gone past the first 50 pages. But I did make sure I threw the book away so no one else would waste his or her time. Do not waste your money on this book."
3,Kilo Class: China's 10 Soviet Supersubs To Nuke Taiwan!,"Russia has developed a new line of Kilo-class nuclear attack submarines. They decide to sell these subs to other nations that violate international laws. China orders 10 of these super-stealthy and -deadly subsurface warships, but the U.S. Navy proceeds to destroy eight of them."
5,"Quick, Simple, and Delicious","I love Thai food but I sometimes shy away from the recipes because of all the unusual ingredients and steps. In this book there are prob. 7 Thai ingredients that you need for all the recipes; make a list, buy them on the ethnic food websites if you can't find them in the stores, and then you'll be all set. If I recall you need red and green curry paste, tamarid, kir lime leaves and lemongrass(you can get both of them dry), unsweetened coconut milk, and fish sauce. All the recipes are simple and they are delicious. I bought this book for my mother-in-law and she loves it! If this is your first time cooking Thai then this is the book for you."
3,"Quick and easy, but not always delicious","I'm a university student expanding my cooking horizons and i bought this book hoping for some savory thai cooking. Although many of the recipes are good alot of them are just tasteless. I wouldn't really recommend this book as its kind of hard to tell which recipes are going to work, and which ones arent."
2,Don't be fooled! Bernie Mac does is not present in this video.,"Bernie Mac is not present in this video in no way, shape, or form. Unless there is some unknown actor who happens to be in this video who is also named Bernie Mac, then don't look for the ACTOR Bernie Mac. While the video does show some interesting steps, by various instructors, I would not recommend it for ""learning"" how to step with a partner. Most of the instructions shown does not show ""techniques"" (i.e. turning, spinning, etc) and its designed for just SEEING various steps. Unless you plan on ""steppin"" in the same spot I would look somewhere else for learning how to ""couple dance"". There are even some parts of the video that just repeats itself within the DVD."
2,Worked well for 5 months,"didn't think i'd need anything more than a 4 dollar cable. Its a cable after all, never had a problem with a cable of any kind. Sound in the left speaker consistenly not transmitted through the speaker after 5 months of use. have to jiggle it around and get it in the right position and then keep it there for it to work with both sides. buying a new one today."
2,Cable has trouble connecting,"I recently purchased this cable to connect my iPod/computer to my speakers, which I had not used in a while, due to not having a cable. When I started using the product, I thought at first that my speakers were broken, because at times I could only hear the bass line or only the treble line. But I soon realized that the cable does not hold a connection very well, and indeed, it must be twisted around constantly or held in place to insure a clear sound.I will be buying a different cable."
2,First Belkin Disappointment!,"1. I have a iPhone3Gs with a case, the cable won't get on without removing the case!2. I did manage to use the product for about 10 days (hence the extra star), as I was compelled to do so. I was on a 4000 mile road trip. Shielding is not that good, but good for the price I guess. But somehow the sound quality deteriorated after around 8 days of use. When I moved the cable a little bit, it would go back to normal.I later returned the product as I had already bought a aux cable from radioshack, which I have to say, works flawlessly, I don't even need to remove the case. Its not too over priced, I think I bought it for $7. I definitely would recommend this over the Belkin. That said, I am a big fan of Belkin products, if it were not for the first issue I would have definitely reordered a replacement!"
4,Outstanding album....,"I picked this up here on Amazon a week or so ago and haven't been able to put it down since. At the same time, I also picked up a bunch of albums from the early to mid 2000's: Blue Scholars, Iomos Marad, Commonmarket, other All Natural albums, etc. This LP stands out above the rest. Productions shines above lyrics, but just barely. Tone B and Cap D can flow for sure, but I find that their vocal quality doesn't stand out as much as some other MC's ... I've loved Dug Infinite since I first heard One Day It'll All Make Sense. El Da Sensei rips it on ""Keep it Movin'"" but don't blink or you'll miss his verse. I'm going to come back and do an in depth review later, but if you're reading this review, just buy the album. You'll be glad you did. Also, I can't believe this only has one review (and from 3 years ago at that!!!)"
5,Best trance cd took years to find again,I used to have this CD in 2001. walked into an independent cd store and they recommended this CD. Im tempted to spend the 30$ to get it again. When my car was stolen the thing i was pissed most about is this cd being stolen with it. Sad but thats how much of an impact this CD had on me. Its 2010 and im raving about it
4,another good mix from micro,"micro's been one of my favorite djs for a long time now, and i have been very happy with his micro-tech mix series. djmixed.com is up to the standards set by those discs. the cd starts off strong, and maintains a high intensity throughout. silvio ecomo's 'standing' is a classic song, and it flows nicely into the pvd/st.etienne collaboration. all of the tracks are strong - micro has an ear for what makes people really dance. some say that this is micro's best mix, but i prefer his live cd. either way, this one's worth picking up. great driving music, if you ask me."
1,Not THE Mary Stewart and it's boring and stupid,Should be clearer that this is a different person than it is because I regret purchasing it and thankful it was kindle and not hardback
1,Awful,"Sounds cute, reads badly. There's nothing interesting sexually in this book, just things you've read before written in a dull manner, with an unbelievable story line no matter which route you take."
1,Flimsy,"The design is extremely flimsy: when you try to roll the main container, it has a tendency to slide off the wheels. We also found that this product did not compost nearly as well as two simple plastic garbage cans flipped upside down and stacked on top of each other in the yard (with the bottom of the lower one cut out). Avoid this overpriced piece of junk... realistically, I would pay $20 for it, but not $150."
4,Cute little effective tool,Hey this thing is not only cute but very handy to toss those veggie and fruit scraps along with the coffee grounds for composting. It sits on our small back porch and we love it. I'm still thinking about how to empty it though????
2,not in Vermont,"I've tried this unit for two winters in Vermont. The compost just sits in there and freezes to a solid mass. In spring I still have all the garbage, and it is impossible to get the soggy gook out of the small opening. I do use leaves and kitchen wastes, as well as the enzymes sold to go with the unit. Am I missing something?"
5,your cats will love this too!,"I got them the dvds because I noticed them watching 'regular' television. And I thought why not get them something for cats, well I'm glad I did, they all love the dvds."
3,It was just OKAY !!,"I was hoping this video would have had more footage of other cats. My cat sat in front of the television for a few minutes, I thought she was enjoying the show. She was particularly attentive to the cats on the screen when they showed up. Unfortunately, they weren't on there very long at all, then on to a rodent making screeching nosies from atop his cage. Of course this irritating part went on for quite a while. My cat lost interest within the first ten minutes. Would I buy this DVD again,? I think not."
5,cats love this one- The Most,"I have had other movies like this, but my 2 cats love this one the most!It holds there attention so well and gets them playing with my tv screen and meowing with the other cats on the dvd.get this it works just fine.also I think when I ordered it, it had a lowest price.c.s"
1,I wanted natural soundtrack but cannot switch the track!,I got the music track rather than natural track. No help as to how to switch the soundtrack. Have written for customer support but haven't got any response even after 8 months of writing to them! Highly disappointing! Total waste of money!
2,Dont bother ordering this,"there is nothing special about this paper, not in the least bit different from the regular cheap copy paper for color or B&W. by the time you pay the ridiculous shipping price and wait to get it, you would be far better off to get regular copy paper from your local office supply store!"
4,Good Enough Paper,"If you are like me and don't know 20 lb paper from a hole in the ground unless you actually touch it, this is ""normal"" paper. It prints just fine in my HP LaserJet and in my Brother all-in-one inkjet printer. If you just want to buy some regular, not too dark, not fancy, plain, everyday use printer paper, this one is just fine."
2,Very Low Quality Paper,"This paper is very thin and low quality, which surprised me based on what they are charging for it. This is the kind of paper that will jam in your printer and/or start pulling 5-6 pages at a time if your printer is even slightly warn. I work in IT and we would occasionally run into this cheap type of paper when someone doing the supply ordering was trying to save a buck. Paper this thin causes constant problems in printers, especially ones that get used a lot. I have a laser printer, and I can't even imagine trying to use this stuff in and inkjet.The generic printer paper I get from my local computer store is better quality, for only $2.99. The $5.99 version is much better than this stuff. For $6.99 I really expected better quality paper. I cannot believe how thin and flimsy this paper is. It's almost as thin as lens cleaning paper. I only recommend it as a last resort."
2,Shipping and Tax Equals Cost of Paper,"This is a review of the combination experience of this paper and Office Depot. Because the order was cancelled this is not a review of the paper itself which I'm sure is just fine. I just received a note from Office Depot that my order was cancelled. Well, that turned out to be good because although this box of paper is a good price at just over $38, the shipping is almost the same price at over $35! With tax that comes to just under $80 that would have been charged for this box of paper. Watch out for shipping charges."
2,Too Dry,"I love SnackMasters' turkey jerky, so I naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky. This turkey jerky is the same (or better) quality as the regular variety, but too dry. I would recomendSnackMasters Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki, instead"
2,third class,this book is terrioble and it is useless reading it.i hate it and i reccomend u not to read or buy this book.it is useless and a waste of money
4,A fairly intense read.,"The Great Siege starts a little slow. It meanders as it establishes the history of the conflict and the geography in which the siege takes place. Once it sets the stage however, the book really begins to take off. It becomes less a recitation of history and becomes a flowing narrative. This is not to say it becomes a work of fiction but rather the history becomes a chain of events that flow from moment to moment and event to event with mounting intensity. The actual resolution of the siege is so sudden it's almost a let down to all the drama that preceded it. A fictional narrative would have been paced a little differently but you know what they say about truth and fiction. I highly recommend this to anyone with even a slight interest in the Siege of Malta or a broad interest in history in general."
3,"Like the chunky apples, but the Oatmeal could be better and creamier","I like the generous serving of real apples in this oatmeal. However, one packet does not have enough oatmeal for a hearty breakfast. Two packets at a time work best. Not very creamy, which was sort of a bummer, so you really need 2 packets. but an ok instant cereal."
4,Trevor Sutcliffe,"Ohh man. I'd rather have all the vinyl, but this CD along with fellow gravity bands antioch arrow and clikatat ikatowi could practically complete a hardcore collection. Heroin is good to, but their 7""s aren't too good and that's half of the CD."
2,1 of 2 rolls was okay,"Used this tape on white board to make a chart. Of two rolls of tape, one of them worked fine, but the other one's non-adhesive backing did not peel off cleanly. This backing tore and stayed stuck to the adhesive side on and off over half of the roll. It must have taken at least 5x as long to put down the tape because the torn backing had to be removed to affix the tape adequately to the board. The backing had to be removed since we were using a dry erase marker eraser over the lines, and we needed a tight, continuous bond between the tape and the board to prevent the tape from being lifted when the eraser was passed over it.Had we used this tape on a car, I would have been more frustrated since the process of removing the torn backing slightly pulled and stretched the tape, and these flaws would have prevented us from laying down a really even and straight line."
1,Must've been a lousy edit job,"I listened to the book on tape, which might have been my first mistake (if buying the tape wasn't). I got a view of a man with zero personality whom women throw themselves after. Maybe it's a guy thing, being entertained by such tripe. Maybe it was poor editing, I don't know. I just couldn't understand how you can have a guy who's looking for a missing person. He already knows that the bad guy does criminal activity on his boats. Well, wouldn't you think that before you chose to sink one of his boats, you'd check to see if the missing person might be on it? Struck me as entirely too stupid."
1,More like Drowning To Catalina...,"When I'm into a good read, I will have that book by my side until it's finished.. I put this book down for 5 days and nearly forgot about it! If that tells you much..I have been caught in a spell of finding horribly boring books lately, where this book was recommended as ""an amazing story."" How could you go wrong with that?, I thought. Yeah well, to my disappointment, I was bored through this entire book. There were so many different characters and names to remember, I got lost a nearly gave up in the beginning. Forcing myself to finish the book, I was hoping for a possible twist ending to wake me up, but that never happened. I ended up skipping about 30-40 pgs to get to the last chapter -just to see how it ends (so I could start on a real page turner). Little to my surprise it was a depressing ending. How do books like these get published? Honestly!?"
2,"Like a corndog; lots of fluff, little meat","Stuart Woods used to be one of the authors whose books I would buy as soon as they came out. Swimming to Catalina and the past few have moved him into ""I'll wait for my public library to buy it, until I read anymore of his books"" status. The plot is as thin as the Hollywood people Woods writes about and transparent from the first pages. Stone Barrington is supposed to be a character that women drool over, (Woods' prose is more explicit) but I could find nothing within worth emulating. Perhaps all character development has been done in earlier books. When the scheme that has Barrington moving from hotel, to hotel and back again is revealed, Woods wraps it all up within a few pages and calls it a day. A formula work at best."
1,I just call it Paranormal Porn,"I thought the concept of a shapeshifting storyline sounded kind of cool. The concept still is. The book, misses the mark.It isn't so much a storyline as it is a thinly written set-up for the next explicit sex scene. There isn't a plot to speak of. Character development is less than lukewarm. Truly, the purpose of dialogue in this book is to set up the next porn-trash scene. Themes in both stories include forced sex and threads of beastiality."
5,Great Sigourney Weaver movie,This movie is a mind game that holds the attention of anyone willing to pay attention. It's hard to give this one the raves it deserves because it would ruin the fun to carelessly give any of it away to those who haven't seen it yet.
1,Didn't see it.,I fell asleep. 17 more words to make this thing go away.17 more words to make this thing go away.
3,huh?,"was this a documentary or a movie, I couldn't tell. Real waste of talent, but the myth busters storyline was informative. Could have done it with monkeys would have been more entertaining, they could have narrated for the monkeys and saved a ton of dough. Three stars was generous, maybe I should take one back."
3,Just okay.,"It was pretty interesting and intense in some areas, but so cliche and predictable in others. I would rate this as a, I can't find anything else to watch because I have seen it all choice."
2,"I really wanted to like this movie...but,","I really wanted to like this movie. A stellar cast, creepy preview, led me to believe it was going to be a great supernatural thriller - Wow, let down. At times this was worse than a B-movie. I'll sum up with 3 cons: 1. Bad acting. Never thought I'd see great actors say lines so stupid -""How'd you do that? How'd you do that? How'd you do that?"". 2. Bad editing/continuity. Cillian gets his face graphically beat and bloodied in a restroom, and the next SECOND there is very little blood on his face? 3. Bad storytelling. Scenes go on pointlessly, nothing to do with the movie (a line of salt in Deniro's room?), and worse - using fakey newscasters and news broadcasts to tell key (yet redundant) points of the story. Awful."
1,Very simplistic,"The premise is good and I thought something very different would come out of this movie, but it is far-fetched. Ok, the end is unexpected, still, it is really boring...."
2,"Great actors, not a bad plot, bad execution","Like the actors in this movie and felt they did a good job. However, the lighting was so dark in the film I had trouble following it. There is a scene where the protagonist gets jumped in a restroom and a long, drawn out, gratuitous beating takes place. I finally had to remove my earbuds and look away. I don't see how either involved in the fight was able to walk upright after it was over and wasn't sure how it added to the plot, other than to make it R rated for violence.I wouldn't recommend this movie."
4,Nice Surprise,This movie turned out to be pretty good. I am not sure how I came across this one but I am glad I did. Some major characters and great plot make this movie a great rental. If you enjoyed Chronicle this will be right up your alley.
4,Interesting plot,"Not the same old stuff, an interesting twist at the end. Top-notch actors provide good performances in a movie I missed at theaters."
3,Okay,"The movie was okay. Not great but okay, good was to pass time.Actting not bad. But you got DeNiro in it."
5,Perfect,"Solid. Sturdy, and simple. there isn't much to anti static wrist bands, it just comes down to quality. and i see myself having this one for a long time."
1,Do not buy,"On my first use, the connector from the wire to the wrist band broke. Its not worth the cost or shiping. I have not been a fan of belkin, and i will never buy another product of theirs again, period. Over priced equiptment with horid quality."
2,A total waste of reading time,"I have found some of Rita Mae Brown's novels amusing.This wasn't one of them.The book has the heroine who has the unexplained name of Cig going on a fox hunt from which she then goes backward in time to 1690.The historical setting of the book does seem to be accurate, but the plot leaves a great deal to be desired---mainly I wish it had had one!The book prods 356 pages (paperback version) to a deadly dull finish.As Rita Mae Brown has written lesbian novels in the past, I had hopes the heroine would be lesbian, but such was not the case.>BR>>P> The only lesbian in the book is the heroine's daughter, who is an extremely minor character.If you suffer from insomnia, this book might do the trick for you."
2,Dissapointed can half juice half soft mushy chunks with little flavor.,Very dissapointed. We love Native forest especially the pinapple but this was a big let down. Cans were only half mango with the other half juice. They taste nothing like fresh mango. My 8 yr old son who loves mangos said they taste like baby food. Soft chunks with only mild mango flavor.
3,Mango's had a kindof strange taste,"They weren't rotten or bad, they just didn't taste like Mango's, more like a babyfood taste"
1,"Too big, too heavy, too ugly","i recieved this as a gift, and when I saw it I had to lie to my grandma about liking it. OK, it is quite good for holding so much but really! It was 3 pounds, costs too much and is the most hideous looking thing I've ever seen. Buy an iPod!"
1,Piece of Garbage,"It says in the instructions that Windows 98 may not recognize this device. Oh, is that all? To remedy this small problem it goes on to suggest unplugging the USB, reinstalling the software, and then ""finding"" the drivers yourself. I assume that had I been one of the people for whom the installation went smoothly I might have a more favorable review, but I wasn't so lucky.After wasting a night getting it to work, I discovered that the software is garbage. It takes over as your primary MP3 player, not to mention every other music related program you may have. All I want is a way to transfer music between the device and my computer. This software tries to connect with the company server to gather info on you every chance it gets. Then it will give you music recommendations and offer to sell you CDs.Everything about this smells of ""cheapness,"" except the price tag. After a few days I decided it just wasn't worth it. I would avoid this at all costs."
2,Defective,"I loved the price and the capacity on this player, but it frequently stops working for no reason. To get it started again you need to remove the battery. Needless to say, this is a huge pain. Customer service is a joke."
3,Good and funny,"This was a very funny book with some really believable characters. Not my favourite chick lit author, but I'll still look forward to her next one."
4,I found a new author,I really enjoy these light hearted romance books. I have been searching for someone and something new for a while. This book was an easy and enjoyable read. I loved it. I went to the library the next day and borrowed Party Girl which was even better. Give Sarah Mason a try it will be time well spent.
1,This is a Bootleg...,"The discs in this collection are not even DVD, they're DVD-R or DVD-RW or something. Look at the DVD logo. It's actually a backwards D with VD written next to it, and underneath it is a white oval with ""video"" printed underneath of it. To make things worse, the discs were scratched. I did get a good laugh out of reading the copyright on the back, though."
4,3 Nuts Short of a Bunch,"This is Vol 2 of a five vol set. Vols 1&2 are all Curly shorts, but 17 of his are not included! Vols 3-5 are Shemp & Joe shorts, with 2 of Shemp's missing. The technical quality of Curly's are fine but Shemp's and Joe's are frequently very poor.Additionally, 5 shorts from Vol 3 are repeated on Vol 4 and 9 on Vol 5, and the labelling is pretty poor, with lots of speling mistooks!Overall, this set is reasonable for the price but unsatisfying for the purist."
2,Poor Packaging,I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them. Two of the four contained absolutely no protective packaging to prevent them from moving around or being crushed. One box was crushed severely on one end and as a result two of the boxes containing the breadsticks was also crushed. Some of these boxes contain little more than bread crumbs. I have opened several boxes and have yet to come across even one whole breadstick let alone a box with the entire amount whole.I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing. I would not purchase these unless you want to use them for breading.
5,Refills for the best Label Maker Ever,"I love my Dymo LetraTag label maker so much so of course I need refills for it often! These labels are awesome! Make my house all neat and organized, just the way I like it!"
1,Cuisinart Nylon Fork is Nearly a Spoon,I purchased two of these and wish I had kept the paperwork to return them. This fork has such wide tines that it looks like a spoon from the side. The tines aren't narrow enough at the end to pierce or pickup anything except maybe a large cut of meat. I guess that explains why Amazon is trying to get rid of them. Go to the dollar store where they have real forks.
3,Not a snug fit for Camry 96 I4 and Sienna 98,"Bought two of these as after rebate, it was almost the price of a disposable filter. I bought for a Camry 96 I4, and Sienna 98. In both cases, I used a box cutter to shave off some material from two corners to make them fit well. I even double checked that this filter is the right one for each car, using amazon's utility."
1,Has he ever been up here?,"No, I have not listened to the entire album. But I will say this. I was born, raised, and still currently live in Champaign, Illinois. And I am deeply offended by the song on the album. Has Damon ever been up here? Sure it's a small town and sure we'd all love to get our hands on a small town girl. But there are not any bars down the street from any houses. The city ordinances wouldn't allow it. And yes there is such thing as family here. Where does he get the idea that there isn't? We are not some run down town. We have a great University. Oh, and by the way, no whorehouses here. I've been here 21 years and never seen one. So, Mr. Bramblett, before you write a song about a geographical location, make sure you visit the location first. This isn't Texas."
5,Once Again Saunders and Henley at their best,"I love all Combat episodes, not only they bring memories of good times past but it is very good WW II drama."
3,"Has potential, but not polished","This book is written at a level appropriate for someone with a little previous experience programming in other languages. Although it is positioned as useful for a complete novice, it makes too many assumptions about the reader's understanding of programming concepts and vocabulary to really serve as a starting point for a first time programmer. Also, the many innaccurate figure references, typos, grammatical errors, mismatches between figures and the text describing them, etc., fail to inspire the confidence that someone new to programming would hope for when purchaing a book of this type. This is a shame, because the concept is a good one. A little more attention to editing would have gone a long way to making this a very good book."
3,just a mix cd but keoki just the same.,"good, but needed some of his own stuff on it not just his mixes"
5,Enthralling video,This video keeps the students in the juvenile detention center riveted.What a great way to introduce new exciting ideas to students who don't get out of the city.
2,Not truly complete....,I have a hard time knowing how truly complete this book is. The fact that VA Home Loans and FHA Home Loans are not covered (things that apply to millions of buyers) makesme think there is probably much more missing. Too bad the last book I used is out of print.
4,A Little Smaller than I Expected...,"In came in very good condition. They are quality made and heavy duty toys, just I imagined that they'd be a little larger."
1,Where is the smell?,I found these products to have almost no smell. The packaging is nice but if you want smell forget it.
4,For my printer,I dont know how to review this product. It serves its purpose and the price was right.
5,Needed to run HP C6180 All-In-One,"This cable is required to work the HP C6180 printer, scanner, copier, and fax. It is not included with the C6180. The store where I purchased the C6180 did not have this cable, and since I am handicapped I couldn't go from store to store to find one. Went to Amazon, of course, found it, and it was sent right away. So easy, why anyone uses gas, time, etc. to find items is a puzzlement and the icing on the cable was that it was a freeship. lynnieff"
1,Beware - Don't Buy - Red Alert!!!,"The author of this book should be ashame for writing this crap. The title does not match the story and I think all who have purchased this book, should receive a refund.I was so embarrassed in reading this book, it's very filty and discussing. It's nothing to be proud of. I urge everyone who may be thinking about purchasing this book, don't do it - trust me.Giving this a 1 Star, is not accurate, it should be 0."
1,Poorly Written,The reader did not have to be reminded of the same things time and time again in this book. It was a waste of time and money if you ask me. And the whole plot was ridiculous.
4,"If you like Dragnet, you should like this","I bought this DVD because I have a strong nostalgiac streak, even if it's for things that predate me (such as this series). I loveDragnet(both the television and radio series) and other black-and-white shows from a bygone era. This series is similar to ""Dragnet"" and worth a look especially for the prominent role a woman, Beverly Garland's character, has in law enforcement.The 25-minute shows lack, as you might expect from their length, much depth, and there is no particular mystery here. Nonetheless, I found these episodes from the late '50s enjoyable and easy to watch. The DVD transfer is hardly great, but it is more than watchable, and ""Decoy"" is recommended to anyone who enjoys ""Dragnet."""
2,Very Disappointing,"Despite the hype and publicity that this book has received, I found it to be very humdrum and the characters lacking. The whole 'scene' was depressing, the people lacked any character or inspiration at all. Some characters' storylines just seemed to wander off into nowhere, while others were tied up and presented in a very neat little package. I expected more from this author."
2,Not as great as I expeced.,"As a huge fan of Russo, I was disappointed with this story. In my opinion the characters were not easy to sympathize with and the whole thing just sort of bogged down in the middle. I forced myself to finish the book because I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't.Spend your money on Straight Man, Empire Falls, or Nobody's Fool. Skip this one."
2,A fan disappointed,"I came to ""Mohawk"" after reading two other Russo books, ""Straight Man"" and ""Nobody's Fool"", both of which I enjoyed tremendously. I truly admire his sardonic wit, sense of the absurd and insightful prose. That said, I found this book, his first, to be a disappointment. Russo's storytelling abilities were not yet as strong, his characterizations weak. In fact, all of the people who populate the town of Mohawk seem to be more archtypes than fully realized individuals. The book is divided in two parts, with a jump in five years, leading to abrupt shifts in focus, inconsistency in character development and some hasty and murky plotting. The second half was just not as interesting to me as the first, and almost seemed like a different book. Russo's rapier-sharp wit is in short supply, as well, which is one of his strongest assets as a writer. Any Russo is better than none, but if you haven't read him, I would stick to the other two aforementioned books."
2,Far From His Best Work,"If you liked Straight Man and Nobody's Fool (as I did) and expect more of the same out of Mohawk, you will be disappointed. These characters don't do anything and evoked nothing in me but boredom and occasionally disgust. And you don't read Russo for a screaming plot, so there is not much left."
4,Low Country Magic and Lore,"The beauty of South Carolina and the islands of its outer banks is presented with tenderness and a love that the author can't hide.Caroline Venable has fond memories of her time spent with her grandaddy on the island. It is a magical place where ponies run wild and the marshes sing with exultant airs; it lies among the reeds and bull rushes in an untouched state. Caroline's life holds a dark secret, and the turmoil is coming to a head, as the island is threatened to be developed by the person she would least suspect.Siddons has produced a wonderful book with characters that employ your attention from the start. If you enjoy this authors writing, another superb book is COLONY. Kelsana 11/23/01"
3,Good Accessory,"I havent used it yet, I got it for vacation next month, thats the reason i only gave it 3 stars. I think its a great idea to get additional plugs for when traveling. I'm sure it will come in quite handy down the road"
1,Dissapointed,"This case was not what I expected. It holds only the dock, no room for the piece that holds the paper, converters or anything else. The camera bag included is tiny & has just a drawstring. I have the 740 & it barely sqeezes in & does not close, I've since bought another case. I see no reason to buy this travel kit."
1,Charager DOES NOT Charger,"I was impressed with the charger for about 1 month---than it stopped charging the NiMh batteries it came with. I took it back to Best Buy only to find that ALL of the Rapid Chargers on thier shelf did not work either. A sales person and I tested them all, hoping I would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked.It was more disappointing after calling Kodak ---they were unable to replace it or get my money back. I thought purchasing a Kodak was a smart decision, however, they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing."
2,Does not spread holiday cheer through carols,"This product was utterly adorable, however, I had purchased it as a gift for an aunt who loves very kitchy Christmas decor only to end up returning it due to the fact that it plays hip-hop music, not Christmas carols. Still very cute if you don't mind the music."
2,THAY NEED HELP FROM DESTINY'S CHILD - Tasha,"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOU LIKE THE SAME SONG ALL OVER AGAIN, AND AGAIN. PLEASE THAY ARE NOT BETTER THAN DESTINY'S CHILD, THAY CANNOT COMPARE. IAM SOORRY, BUT I ONLY LIKE THREE SONGS, IAM SO HAPPY THAT I DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM, SOMEBODY GAVE IT TO ME."
5,"TLC+Blaque+Destiny's Child- Swears=702, the best group!","I bought this C.D. not exactly knowing what it would be like.I had heard ""Where's my Girl at"" and nothing else on this album. Now, It's the best album I've bought. All the songs have great muaic, lyrics, and voices. TLC can't topple this mountain of hits, not even close."
4,You Don't Know... What You're Missing!,"Unlike most of the people who reviewed this album, I didn't like ""Where My Girls At?"" at all. But I was instantly addicted to ""You Don't Know"". So I bought the album, and found many sweet surprises. Kameelah has the strongest voice in the group, and it shines through on the ballads, a welcome change from the usual hip-hop type songs 702 usually covers. Tracks like ""Finally"", ""What More Can He Do"" and ""Make Time"" make this album worthwhile.... try it and see."
3,IN ONE WORD TIGHT!!!!,"I AM A TRUE 702 FAN, SINCE THEIR DEBUT, THE ALBM IS HOT AND I LOVE THE SONGS ""YOU'LL JUST NEVER KNOW"" AND OF COURSE ""WHERE MY GIRLS AT?."" THEY ARE SURELY PROVING THEMSELVES IN THE OH SO COMPETITIVE FIELD OF R&B. THEY KINDA REMIND ME OF SWV. MAYBE THEY'LL BE THE NEW SWV OF THE NEXT MILLENIUM--TAKE OFF WHERE SWV LEFT US FANS HANGING!!! YOU GO 702!!! DO YOUR THANG!!!"
3,lots of repeated information.,"I amTrue crime afficianado, not a book I would reccommend to buy. Anti climatic. Fuhrman offers some intresting theories on who killed MM, But nothin new."
3,Engrossing analysis of small-town murder and cover up,"Engrossing account of Fuhrmans activities investigating a still unsolved murder in affluent Fairfield County. His sardonic accounts of his encounters with the local good old boy police force, the hostility and pretensiousness of Moxleys old neighbors and the general atmosphere he paints of the subtle cover up eand underhandedness of everybody involved is page turning reading. Not one of the players in this book can be trusted and Furhmans relaying of how he begins to sniff out the truth withheld for the past 20 years is suspense novel material. If he had written this as fiction, no one would believe it"
2,Don't Read,"The problem with this book is that Heir Furhman takes the credit for solving the crime. This couldn't be further from the truth.If you want to read the most factual account of this murder, read ""Conviction"" by Len Levitt.However, I believe that if Mr. Skakel can't recall if he committed the murder, how can anyone else be so sure."
3,"interesting subject,however, not enough for a novel","i am glad that mr furman has projects but i was disappointed inthis effort. not up to murder in brentwood. i feel that the information could have been covered in a 30 page thesis..it is obvious that the local police dept erred in all aspects of this case. the attorney general of con. was no better. i have a feling that either dominic dunne or mark furman will be writing soon about jon benet ramsey...the book is too long and too tedious.. sorry mark.. no prizes, only money.."
3,Fuhrman's book offers a variation on the true crime theme.,"I was pleasantly captured by Det. Fuhrman's reporting on the Martha Moxley murder in,""Murder in Greenwich"". Although he will probably never attain the stature of an Ann Rule or Tommy Thompson in terms of elegant style or psychological insight, his perspective as a homocide detective brings fresh eyes to the genre. I especially enjoyed his crime scene sketches, and his lists. I felt as if I were looking into a detective's notebook, and loved it! He is meticulous and serious and never deviates from the investigator's point of view. It is a fresh take in approaching crime reporting, and originally executed. I would love to see him tackle, in the same style, (don't get too slick, Mark), cases such as Jon Benet Ramsey, or Lizzie Borden. Why not? Keep it up Mark, there's an audience out there."
3,Repeats facts alot.,This is an okay book. Furman repeats alot of the info over and over. I didn't even finish the last few pages as they started out the same as everything we already read.
5,"Compelling, interesting, scandalous and hard to put down!",This book is simply awesome. It was well thought out and investigated. I can't believe how much power the Skakel family really has. It is frightening. What is even more frightening is how much they control the town of Greenwich! Mark Fuhrman did an excellent job reporting facts and painting a true picture of what happened to Martha Moxley--something no one else had the guts to do! I commend him on his efforts and I have a lot of respect for him and his work! The Moxley family is very lucky to finally have someone who wants to find the truth and will stop at nothing to help them in their efforts to bring the people who did this to justice! This is definitely one of the best books I have ever picked up-- and hated to put down!
2,noticed,i got caught to with the cm800 it plays fine and all but i cant make any directories if lcd doesnt work i did happen to notice if you let it get cold ( leave in car) overnight in winterthe lcd works for a minute i dont know if this tidbit will help in getting support for repair but it plays still should be a factory recall or voucher
2,You think its good until its gone bad,"I bought this cd player before reading reviews from other places saying that the sreen quit working after a while. I thought it was all good because it never happened until i got back onto the bus one day. Its gone, i took it apart and theres nothing you can do. ..."
2,Airgun pellets,"Most of the pellets are decent, some are perfect and some are so deformed, they don't fit in my airgun. Kinda disappointed but what the hell, cheap stuff is not good and good stuff is not cheap"
5,"Great book, the vocabulary builder is usefull","I liked this vocabulary builder idea more than the dual language books.When reading the dual language books, i find myself reading every line translated, this one, even i if don't completely understand everythingit is much more fun to read. and you get to learn the important words that you don't know cause on other side there is like a small dicto for more difficult words.also the book is very interesting."
1,not good as a learning tool,"This book is not good as a learning tool, it only gives 1 or 2 words of translation per page."
3,If Buddy could hear the music now,"Rockabilly/Country-Western-Swing/Tex-Mex. It's all here. Combining the past with the present. It's like Bob Wills teaming up with Buddy Holly and Doug Sahm. And anybody can dance to it, even if you don't have rhythm in your heel's. Texas music at it's best"
3,Slow grow,"This is a slow grower for me,... not enuff ""hooks"" to really pique my interest,... ""Nice"" stuff, just wanted something ""darker"" or angrier."
5,Great Beginning Chapter Book,"My four year old daughter is very interested in stories with princesses, fairies and anything magical. Tired of reading Disney Princess stories when I stumbled upon this in the bookstore I thought it would be great for her. She also wants to ""read"" chapter books she absolutely loves this book and we can't wait to get Amber the Orange Fairy. The story is obviously geared for young children and reading it aloud isn't as bad as you would think. It is predictable for an adult but my daughter loved every minute. And she even loved Jack Frost's spell.Great book for a beginning reader."
3,Fine for a 7 year old,"My 7 y.o. daughter really enjoyed it. But I found it a bit too obvious--it didn't really challenge her. She could pretty well guess what was goign to happen scene-by-scene. Still, it's full of fairies and magic--which encourages my daughter to read."
2,False description,This product description states repeatedly that it includes 1/2 inch poly tubing and a 3/4 in swivel adapter to 1/2 inch compression fitting. In fact it contains 75 feet of 1/4 inch poly tubing and a 3/4 inch swivel adapter to 1/4 inch compression fitting. This has been mentioned in at least 1 other review and I think it irresponsible not to correct the description.
1,mp6400 = Garbage,Well I see why this item has been taken off the shelf. I received this item as a Christmas gift just this past Christmas. I have tried to load the software onto my computer...what happens...it crashes my computer where i have to reformat the entire thing and start all over again. I went to there website where they have listed new updated software for it. The software that they claim to be updated does not even have all of the files..it was missing files last time I was there just about a week ago. Anyone else having problems ...
2,Don't buy this product. Spend the extra money.,"Not XP compatible, lasted two weeks and then stopped working. Called the manufacturer and was given the run around. Spent money to overnight the thing with the promise of prompt repair or replacement, that was now 39 days ago. I still have not received it back yet. DO NOT buy this product, if for no other reason than service. There are plenty of quality MP3 players that may cost a little more but the service alone is worth it."
2,I was let down !,"I gave the Classic MP6400 a chance, I bought it at [a local store], I came to find out that they are the only store who offered it.* It worked fine with my Windows 98 machine, but never got it to work with Windows XP, (I Even tried compatability shell on it.)(Thumbs Down)* Locating additional software for it was impossible. (Thumbs down)* The Sound was not too bad, clean at lower volumes.(Thumbs up)* The casing was very cheaply made! (Thumbs Down)..., I think they could have put better materials into it.I am going to return it to [my local store] tommarow...Disappointed."
3,meh.,"It's okay, but could be better. The casing's cheap, but the sound quality's good. I bought this for walking to class and going to the gym. Over all though I think I would have been smarter to have just saved my money and bought a better one. I didn't have that much of a problem with running the software and I have Win ME."
1,Don't Buy With Windows XP=Crashed My System,Crashed my new system that I bought over Christmas. I had to reboot my whole system. Haven't downloaded the patch from net yet
2,Disappointing,"There's a lot of hype surrounding this book.That's usually a bad sign.The author, Michael Brown, apparently had an awakening experience which involved healing from a painful condition. Based on that credential, he proceeds to write a lot of hooey, the kernel of which is a regimen for self-awareness. But his explanation for how this process works is a mishmash of psychobabble and New Age thought. There is no innovative material, here. His combination of breathwork, affirmations and study are effective at helping you be present, but the hundreds of pages of rambling that he surrounds it with are, in my estimation, unnecessary."
1,Couldn't get into it,"This was recommended by a friend who said it was a slow read but if a book doesn't grab me in the first paragraph, it's all over for me. Maybe I've just read too many of these kind of books over the years."
1,No meat - Just fluff,"I was very disappointed by this book. While there are some good basic ideas in here, they easily could be covered in a 5 page article. The rest is just filler. Not worth the money."
2,"I wanted to like it, but sadly this one comes up a short!","I still to this day go see Derrick spinning records as much as humanly possible (and I'm getting up there in years!), but this simply wasn't his greatest effort. Any of his old mix tapes far surpass this mix, so if this CD is your only exposure to Derrick Carter, you are not gettin' the goods!Derrick Carter is truly an artist and the best live venue DJ going. Do yourself a favor and see him live sometime in Chicago!"
2,CIA at War,"Detailed look at the workings of the Agency and the influence of its Directors on work and morale; however, the author presented an uncritically positive characterization of Tenet and an equally rosy portrayal of President Bush's handling of foreign affairs. The author ignores lingering questions and concerns (e.g. where are the weapons of mass destruction, statements by the Administration linking Hussein and al Qaeda), frequently uses partisan language and soundbites to describe President Clinton, and, overall, comes off as an apologist for the current Bush Administration."
3,"great songs, horrible production","I have been a big Jazz Butcher fan for several years and awaited this album expectantly--I would love to like it as much as the other reviewers, and probably will continue to pop it in my CD player in the hopes that I will eventually say ""ahh, now I get it""--but...I doubt that will happen. The songs are so well-written, as always, but the drums almost sound like they were programmed on a Casio keyboard...they were, right? I think Pat and Max had a bit too much to drink. If you are a hardcore fan like me, buy it--otherwise, check out Waiting for the Love Bus or some of the early records."
2,"If you're guard/reserve, give this one a miss","I'm sure this is a good resource for active duty military. However, if you're guard/reserve looking for information, give this one a miss. The chapters on education benefits, pay, retirement benefits and medical benefits are all specifically tailored to career active duty personnel. As former active duty now reserve, I didn't find it useful."
4,Classic Christmas Music,"Tasteful, traditional orchestral Christmas music. More importantly, ""Carol for Another Christmas"" may be the most beautiful Christmas composition of the 20th Century."
4,Just as described,item was delivered as expected and just as described in the ad - no complaints from me. Works best if used as shown - back of a hatchback or truck. We use ours in our Subaru Forester (dog enters car from the hatch rear).
1,Stay away,These things are terrible.. went though 5 of them before I found one that works.. Then it died 3 weeks later. Bad product
4,Not as good as some of the others,"My kids love Little Critter, just as I loved him growing up. Somehow I remembered this book being a little bit more substantial or better organized or something. It's a cute book, and it's funny in typical Little Critter fashion, but it's just not quite as good as some of the classics like ""Just Me and My Mom"" or ""Just a Mess."" That being said, my son loves the adorable puppy illustrations, and so do I."
5,CD Holder,I was looking for this exact CD holder to match the others that I have. I couldn't find it in the store so I went on line and I found it. Love it!
5,Love It!!,This looks very good. It is sturdy and very easy to load CD's. Wish they had one that held more CD's. Would recommend to anybody.
2,"Sorry about that, but I don't like it.",That's not a safety place to keep your cds. Design FAIL!!!!Completly different that I was thinking. I'd like something to keep my cd in a easy place when I wanted listening and not to pile them.
3,"Pretty good, though tough to assemble","I like this CD rack very much. It is reasonably priced, attractively designed, and the assembly instructions were clear and simple. However, the imprecise manufacturing made it somewhat difficult to assemble. The metal ends of the tower's four corners are much too large to fit into both the wooden knobs on the top and into the plastic screws on the bottom. I had to take a steel awl and widen the pre-scored holes in the wooden knobs. I also had to resort to using a hammer to pound the plastic screws onto the bottom ends, after which it finally became possible to screw them on. It was a lot of unnecessary trouble, but it worked."
3,The wave,"This Cd rack is very practical. You can store 100 CDs and it has a cool shape; however, it's a little hard to assemble and the base it's not very steady."
3,The Zombies Greatest Hits,"This is a good greatest hit compilation. I do agree that it would be nice if it were remastered, but when this disc came out remastering tools were not at their best. Still however you get all the zombies hit singles and some other nice tunes all on one disc. Good introduction to have for the zombies with some pretty good notes inside CD Booklet. If you want to expand on this disc however, you could pick up the latest anthology set.My top 5:Tell her noTime of the seasonShe's not thereYou make me feel so goodDon't cry for me"
4,wonderful masterpiece.,the zombies were a wonderful group. some of their best collaborations were the Time of the Season.
2,Take the word PREMIUM out of the title!,"I was very disappointed in this Mouse Pad. The surface is to slick and the cursor is all over the place. Take the word ""premium"" out of the title of this product!"
3,ummmm,"the ad look like one i had but when i got it, its a harder surface. works very good but wish it had the softer cloth feel."
2,Very cheap (price & material),"This mouse pad is cheap in both price and the material. The plastic material feels cheap and flimsy, and is not smooth at all. It feels like you are scratching up your mouse as you are moving it around. It is not a pleasant experience to use this pad. I would avoid this one and get something nicer."
2,Not so much,This was a very good price but when I received it the texture bothered me. I can't explain just what it was. I gave it to my son and he is using it.
4,Gritty Milk,"Among the better ""acid jazz"" compilations, though somewhat uneven. Straddles the soul/funk and hard funk lines for the groovy of feet as well as the head-nodders. Milk's ""Beached"" is a bossa-flavored beauty featuring a smooth vocal ride on a hearty, bouyant rhythm - you can almost smell the sea. Who is that lady,anyway? Not to be outdone is Jhelisa's gritty tigress of a voice on a bouncing, funky soulful track. A sweet beat and a fine feminine voice combine for joyful acclaim in any genre. No wonder these are my two favorite tracks here. Nontheless, this disc offers an intriguing range of tones and is worth having if you like funky soul."
1,Herc should save us from the fakery!,This is not the powerful and well orchestrated music of the 60's cartoon I watched on Sunday mornings. Who was allowed to put this hoowey out?
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"Original soundtrack from the Mighty Hercules cartoon? Not even close...what a disappointment! Fans of the popular children's cartoon will feel an urge to remove (destroy) this product as soon as they hear the opening track. If you're looking for the sweeping, powerful voice of Johnny Nash, or the full orchestration that practically defined this classic, look elsewhere. What you'll find here is a milquetoast, watered-down 40's genre mishmash that even Disney would discard. If you're a Lawrence Welk fan, then this is for you; otherwise, skip this one. What a shame!"
5,2 of the 3 greatest bands ever!!,"Journey, REO Spedwagon, and STYX are my favorite bands. It is so hard getting good live recordings of them all. I was very displeased with REO's attempts at a live album until I found this CD. This is 2 cds of great music. I love hearing Arena Rock live and this album delivers it. And you not only get one band, you get both of them. On some of the tracks they jam together. If you are a fan of STYX, REO, or both, then this album is a musthave on your list. A lot of people think STYX lost it after Deyoung left but Tommy Shaw holds his own and truly keeps the band alive. I recently saw all three bands at the Joe Louis Arena and so far this is the closest sound to the greatest night of my life I had that day."
3,"5 stars for REO, 2 for Styx","As a big Styx fan, I bought this cd to get a live performance from the new lineup. The REO cd was going to be ""throw away"" filler. Was I ever wrong! First, this lineup of Styx just can't deliver on the older material. Get Caught In The Act or Return To Paradise for better performances of those songs. Second, REO Speedwagon really rocks! It's non-stop energy from the first song on. Yes, Kevin's voice has lost a little, but once you get past that, you have an exceptional performance. They sound tighter than ever. I wish I would have waited for REO's Live/Plus cd to get the full show from this night."
2,PC USER,"I purchased this sound card while still using Windows 98. I wanted a basic audio card for music and DVD, no gaming or anything fancy and definitely nothing expensive. The price was good and in 98 it wasn't too bad of a card but I wouldn't buy it again. Installing was challenging enough in 98 but impossible in XP as none of the drivers are approved by XP. Now, in XP I am receiving gurgling noises and am planning on buying something else. So much for trying to save money!"
1,A Big...,"...The 5 megapixel label sounds good, but there is a catch. The pictures in the image editor show up at only 72 dots per inch (DPI). They are 72 dots per inch with a 35 inch image. I do not need a 35 inch image. I need a 400 dpi image at 8 x 10 inches. The print quality has been poor despite using a great printer HP CP 1700 by Hewlett PACKARD and top of the line photopaper. I feel cheated. I get better pictures from my Kodak DC 290 camera which I bought 2yrs ago which only has 2.1 megapixels. I have to return this Sony camera because the pictures are not adequate for the work related project for which bought the camera. This has been a big waste of time and money. On the other hand, it is true that the bells and whistles such as the light meters and other features are nice."
5,Excellent Camera,"I just received my Sony DSC-F707 Cyber-shot, I going to tell you the truth, it's incredible, it's really easy to use, it's very light, it's just perfect. I will recommend you to buy a Lexar Memory Sticks they work fine and they're cheaper, also buy a memory stick reader, this download photos very quickly and you don't have to plug the camera anymore, just the stick, this will save you battery life.I'm very satisfied with this purchase, if you like to take a lot of photos this camera is worth every penny, trust me!"
1,Ms. Buyer,The camera worked for exactly one month and then it stopped focusing and when I tried to get it repaired I was told it would cost more than it was worth to fix it. I spent 400.00 for one month's worth of use.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this simply because it has Rex Smith in it. But I ""WASTED"" my money. Think twice......"
3,"Funny, but less successful than other Dilbert books","Scott Adams' main theme here is how to find ""joy"" in the mind-numbing, soul-destroying environment that I like to think of as ""the office."" Compared to some of his other books: (1) it has a weaker overall theme; (2) it relies less on the Dilbert comics; (3) it has fewer ""Scott Adams monologues""; and (4) it makes much greater use of email and other contributions from Dilbert fans. Taken together, these features make it a more sprawling, less cohesive, and (alas) less funny book.But still funny. He has a great collection of office pranks, from harmless fun to mean and not so harmless. There's a lot of material on how to shirk work, some of which could be taken seriously while much could not. OK, but it's weird to mix the two. The book has a lot of chapters like that -- some worthy material but odd mixes and choices that don't work as well as his other books. Read those first, and if you want more, turn to this one later."
3,Disappointing but not too bad,His other text-heavy books are much better; this one felt either too mean spirited or too forced.
2,Getting a little tired. Sigh.,"I live my life according to the Dilbert concepts. In fact, when I was a manager (I escaped and now live in a cube) my guiding light was to try to do things that the pointy-haired boss wouldn't do. I still wasn't successful, but that's another story.I owe much to Scott Adams. However, I didn't enjoy this latest book. I sense that he's now using these books to simply vent and that he is going over material covered in other books. While I snorted and projectile laughed several times during the reading of this book, there were very LONG gaps between each mirthful episode.Mr. Adams writes well and is humorous. But I fear that, at least with regard to his non-comic strip books, he may be in need of more inspiration. Perhaps he needs to get his job back at Pac Bell?By the way, I am a proud member of the DNRC."
3,Good for a commuter...,"Buying this book contributes to helping autistic children. For that reason alone, I'm glad I made the purchase. I enjoyed some of the stories in this short story collection (especially Nick Hornby's own, NippleJesus), but most of them bored me. I recommend Speaking With The Angel to anyone who commutes daily on public transportation, because the stories are short."
4,Tabloid TV hater converted,"I hate tabloid TV. I truly believe it is a contributing factor to the decline of American society as we know it. When my daughter recently purchsed a copy of ""Tabloid Baby"",like the proverbial slowing down to look at a car wreck, I found I couldn't resist picking it up. Much to my surprise (and disgust), I LOVED IT - I LAUGHED MY A.. OFF. The author successfully shows just how many similiarities tabloid news has with ""serious"" news. I found it hilarious that, in most cases, the people reporting the news were crazier & more dysfunctional than their topics. I still hate tabloid TV, but I really love ""Tabloid Baby""."
1,A petty little man tells all- who cares?,"People who wallow in the slime of tabloid journalism then try to make a buck by pretending they are above it are well represented by this book. It will become, no doubt, a monument to the no-talent legions who represent this genre."
5,Can't live without this,Best product for aches and pains. The roll on application is a great way to use this too. I roll it on my neck and shoulder area before bed. It only has a mild smell for a minute-then disappears. Works great!
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","Unlike some reviewers here, I really liked Down to Earth. Saying that, this doesn't measure up to Down to Earth. I think the first two songs are generic. The only 3 songs that stuck with me were Black Rain, Countdown and Trap Door. The last two are really hard rockers. Black Rain itself i think is interesting given the mix of guitar, harmonica, marching sounds. The bottom line is this- if you have been with Ozzy from the start you are going to want to have it for the collection, however, you expect more from Ozzy. I think Ozzmosis was the first album that really broke the streak for me of can't miss Ozzy albums. Usually you buy the album and you listen to it over and over again; listening to the songs like eating candy. Down to Earth brought that back for me. Black Rain will again be an interuption of that pattern."
4,Dearly departing Ozman,"You MUST buy this if only for collections sake. Since this will be his last album (or so says he) you Must savor it!!Mr. Ozman Sir, you are a master artist of your genre, your contributions to R & R will be grieviously missed.Even though I love only 2 of the songs, I will listen to this and cherish the music and your voice and lyrics.You are a delicious little addiction of mine."
2,Do a Black Sabbath Album PLEASE!!,"I'm glad I was able to download this and not have to spend the money. I have been waiting patiently for this album to come out. I got about what I expected from this record. Pretty much a carbon copy of Down to Earth 6 years later. I mean the tracks sound ok but they sound just like the ones from the previous album and they pretty much all sound the same. I just don't get how artists go from making completely amazing music to suddenly always making subpar records. Zakk is an amazing guitarist but everything sounds the same for me. I think he's being wasted. Now, to my last point. Please, for the love of GOD above. When the promotion for this record and tour is over and the Heaven & Hell tour and promotion is over, make one last great Sabbath album. Not an Ozzy record with Sabbath backing him. Then, tour and retire."
5,Ozzman Arrives... (again),"Some folks have written hate reviews; some glowing reviews.Here's one from an OLD fan!Ozzy is NOT BLACK SABBATH! He was, is, and will always be OZZY!This work of art is amazing in the fact he continues to recognize and address the issues we need to recognize and address: ""our children marching into the dessert..."".Ozzy is not Black Sabbath; Ozzy is Ozzy! He has written and recorded a powerful body of work, if only someone will listen!(If you want Black Sabbath, go to the used record store! And while you're trying to buy a ""phonograph"" to play those albums on, try to think of Black Sabbath WITHOUT Ozzy; Tony was phenomanal, but think about it! Unbelievable guitar without Ozzy's lyrics (and vocals)?"
3,A Mixed Bag,"This album is truly a mixed bag. Zakk's fantastic energy, drive and skill really propel the album's best cuts, 'I Don't Wanna Stop' and 'Black Rain'. But the second half of the CD really trails off in originality and tempo. Too many slow songs that tend to all sound the same. Still, its great to hear Zakk again. Looking forward to this summer's Ozzfest as if Ozzy puts a set together of his greatest hits with the best 2-3 tracks from this album it should be a helluva show. So, first half is very good to excellent. Second half is hard rock as elevator music."
5,Awesome,"I think this is just an awesome CD. I was kind of leary after some of the reviews I read but I don't see why some didn't like it. I think it's one of the best music CD's I've heard in a long while whether it's Ozzy or not. I think Ozzy does an outstanding job. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. I can't believe more of the songs have not made it to the radio stations for listening. Gets me up and going everyday on my way to work for the last month."
4,What Else Would You Expect?,"Honestly, what is everybody expecting? You have a man who was a singer on quite a few albums before he was a solo artist and even as a solo artist he's had 9 albums, so is it any surprise that the man is running out of songs to write that are original? Hell, look at Zakk Wylde. I'm in no way shape or form a Zakk Wylde fan, but he's been writing guitar arrangements for 4 Ozzy albums, he had a solo release, a release with Pride and Glory and seven black label society. For everybody who is whining that this cd sounds like everything else Ozzy has released, you try coming up with original material after covering all of that ground.Take the album for what it is; a decent Ozzy release. It's no Ultimate Sin, but it's not horrible either."
4,Over the Hill,Content was good and so was the acting.The story explored aging and the one who is considered aging the one to determine their fate. Video quality was excellent.
2,beeps are 56 DB not 86 Db as advertised in description,"I bought it, and on the packaging it states ""56 DB"" audio not 86 DB as stated in product description...big difference, right? Anyway, I dunno how well it works b/c it arrived w/a dead battery. It said on package that it is a ""life long battery"" and something like 'no need to ever change battery'. I took it as a bad sign and sent back to Amazon. It might work great, but after that, I didn't wanna risk it."
1,Wasn't worth the time.,"I bought this locator and the one in brown for my two kids. First of all the monitor was supposedly able to fit on a shoe, that didn't work, or you could put it in their pocket. YEA RIGHT. neither of my kids had pockets. And when I tested the alarm, it had to be pointed almost right at my child to get the alarm to go off. The alarm only goes off for so long, then if you try to get it to go off again TOO BAD! I had my daughter take it in to the bathroom and shut the door; the alarm wouldn't sound at all. I was going to send them back,but my kids are using them to play with. You're best to go with something else."
3,"It works, but goes off easily","I bought this to use in Disney World. I didn't really use this device on our trip, because it was so sensitive that it would go off accidently when lightly touched as we were walking around. It was very loud. If I had needed it this would have worked from pretty far away and would have gotten others attention. I wish it didn't go off when it was barely bumped because it would have been a great for my piece of mind."
4,"does what it says, but not great for the beach","the bear was easy to use and set up. I bought 2, one of each kid. the parental unit worked for both (so both kids bears beeped when I pushed my button. I bought them for our beach vacation. I could hear the beeps above the wind and waves, but it wasn't over-loud to scare the kids. Improvements: I would make them waterproof, or make a waterproof model available. I had to keep taking them off and put them back on as the kids went swimming. the bear is water-resistant, and it did get a little wet without problems. also I wish there was a clip instead of a belt holder. I had no way to attach it accept to tie it to their bathing suits, kind of annoying for them. Overall, the product does exactly what it says and I found it to function perfectly."
1,Don't bother - Bought for 2 year old,"I purchased this for my two year old daughter for when we go to Disney World. Although she's never been lost (thankfully), this was a ""just in case"" type of thing.From reading the description here and on their website, it seems to me a small bear that they say can attach to a child's sneakers or wear as a bracelet.Once I received it, I knew there was no way this was possible. The bear is HUGE. There is absolutely no way that a small child could wear this as a bracelet. It's ENORMOUS. There is also no way to wear this on a sneaker.Don't waste your time or money. There's no reason this has to be so huge."
3,Works but Big,"This item works well in the house. I could go anywhere downstairs (in rooms, etc.) and the device would beep. Didn't really try it outside.The drawback is the bear is heavy and bulky for my 2 year old. The wrist strap doesn't fit on her wrist or ankle (waaay too long) and in the summer she doesn't wear tennies (so I can't string the bear through any laces). Wish it were smaller and I could attach it to her another way.Also, I could see her pulling the bear off of herself if it were in reach.Would be nice to be able to mount it on her back or somewhere out of reach."
4,Difficult but Effective,"It is smaller than I expected and it is very difficult to get the cord into the channel. However, overall this is a very effective wire-mold and the ability to stick it to walls using the already affixed sticky tape on the back make up for the few deficiencies it has."
3,"Works, OK, cheaper at local Home Depot","It works ok and is a perfect size for a single ethernet cable. The adhesive seems to be coming off after a few months of sticking to the ceiling, but sticking to the wall seems to work better.After initially buying this from Amazon, I found the same product at Home Depot for about half the cost (minus tax)."
3,Hanging Chair Stand,Heavier and larger than I thought. Takes up more room than I'd like. Easy to assemble.
4,sitting pretty,"I really enjoy my hanging chair now because I use it indoors or outside,the stand is great, a bit big but at least it can be moved. Its a great option to having it hanging from the ceiling."
1,hmmm...,"i wonder what a ""reggae"" version of interstellar overdrive would sound like? probably don't want to find out."
1,Disgrace to Pink Floyd!,No one should attempt to cover Floyd. They are one of a kind and don't mix with reggae.
4,A fresh and interesting read,"At last, a logical and reasonable explanation for all the confusing radar and radio information. But he doesn't quite answer all the unanswered questions, ie, What happened to the bodies? Where is the plane? There should be answers, somewhere."
3,Adorable BUT...,The clear spinner is a no-go! It is near impossible to play the game when no one can spin. We have the tea party version and that spinner is better. We still try but for the little ones it quickly proves frustrating. Yoohoo Eeboo-fix the spinner:P
4,Intriguing Thriller!,"This novel is set on an archealogical dig, in the Irish countryside. An ancient body is dug up, but when a far more recent body is unearthed, and a member of the archealogical team is murdered, it becomes apparent, that there is a killer in the local community.It is an interesting novel, with a variety of characters, and has you guessing most, if not all of the way through, as to the identity of the murderer.It also paints a vivid image of the Irish countryside, and its rich Celtic past."
3,A good read.,"I found myself thinking of this as a very ""Irish"" book, in that pace and mood seemed to reflect the Irish bogs. There are numerous characters lives are as intertwined as a Celtic knot. I found myself a bit annoyed at Nora at times, but not so much that it detracted from the story. While perhaps not as good as her first book, it still a very good read."
5,Lexmark lift off tape for typewriter,These tapes are of extremely good quality. I would recommend them to anyone. They are easy to install and use.
4,"Come Home With Me, 3.5 Stars","Killa Cams third album is solid, ""OH Boy"" and ""Hey Ma"" had 2002 on smash, I still remeber it like it was yesterday. He also had a video for ""Daydreaming"", which was a dope song but it was too long clocking in about 6 min and 30 seconds, another long song was ""Losing Weight, Pt. 2"". Besides the singles, the other standouts are ""The ROC (Just Fire)"", ""Live My Life (Leave Me Alone)"", ""Come Home With Me"", ""Welcome to New York City"", ""On Fire Tonight"", which was a funny song where Zeek was talking about a girl who burned him Lol..Cam easily gets outshined by Mcgruff on ""Stop Calling"". I wasnt feeling ""I Just Wanna"", ""Dead Or Alive"" and ""Tomorrow"" just seems out of place. Overall the album has some entertaining songs but at the same it suffers from rhymes and hooks by Cam. The production is good, you get beats from Ty Fyffe, Kanye West, Just Blaze, The Heatmakerz and others. If you're not a Dipset fan then most likely you'll only enjoy the singles. 3.5 Stars"
2,*yawn*wink*snore,"remember when cam'ron came out the box with such songs as ""horse and carriage"", and ""let me know?""...my question is...what happened? i can't help but to associate him with noreaga as the two most disappointing lyricists of circa '98 that had potential. is cam'ron witty? he shows flashes, but on this cd, he doesn't really say anything that we haven't already heard. the only thing that holds this cd up is the production. if you want to hear cam, listen to a mixtape or a diss record. my opinion is that he's at his best in that light."
3,"tight beatz, wack lyrics","Good songs: Oh Boy, Hey Ma and On fire tonghtAnnoying songs: I Just WannaBad songs: everything else"
2,This album ... ...Boy Boy,"To be perfectly honest, Cam'Ron is not one of my favorite rappers. The first single, ""Oh Boy,"" in my opinion, is a very annoying song. But after hearing the second single ""Hey Ma,"" I figured that this may not be as bad as an album as I thought. In fact, maybe it would be pretty decent. It was just recently that I purchased the album and I was hoping for at least a few listenable songs. I couldn't even get that from Cam.Besides the great beats to almost every song, this album has nothing to offer. Every song on this album is garbage with the exceptions of ""Hey Ma"" and ""Welcome to New York City."" The song ""Tomorrow"" I kind of like because of the positve message it portrays. So, I either program my CD player to only these three songs, or I don't listen to this ... at all. The only reason this gets two stars is because of the beats and the two songs that I mentioned."
3,Unrealistic and somewhat entertaining,it takes the VCTF seven years to capture their number one enemy. you have to ask why the team was still in place for so long being so poor at finding Jack. Dr. Watters is a painful charecter to watch. she is so socailly inept and lacks self confidence when interacting on a persoanl level. annoying as hell. Baily is Mr tough guy yet is about as incompetent a leader as one could ever find.
4,Great Fondue Set,"Overall, a pretty good fondue set. It's sturdy and holds a good amount.The 3 top features:- The ceramic/earthenware is lighter than cast iron and, for cheese fondues, allows the heat to dissipate faster which helps keep the cheese from burning when you adjust the burner.- Dishwasher safe. But it cleans so easy, I didn't feel the need to toss it in the dishwasher. Nice to have that option, though.- Can go straight from the stove to the table.I just wish the fondue forks were a little more traditional (wood with colored knobs). It would help to keep the owners keep tab on their forks when cooking times are longer (like with fondue bourguignonne)."
2,"Disappointed, but persevering","I just finished the 9-week program, which the authors wisely emphasize is just meant to get you started. I complied with the diet about 80 percent of the time, and the workouts about the same. I have gained a small but noticeable amount of muscle definition in my shoulders and arms, but I lost only about six or seven pounds ... roughly half of what I had expected based on the testimonials in the book. I'm pulling my belt in one more notch, but still wearing the same size pants, so I didn't lose the four or five inches their test subjects claim to have.The diet is easy enough to follow, and includes enough recipes to not be too monotonous, especially if you use the principles to find additional meals. But at this rate, it will take me a year to reach my goal weight, and I know I won't follow it that long unless I get some significant success much sooner than that."
4,Strum and Pick,"I grew up listening to and playing some slack key. The CD I ordered came to me in excellent shape and within the time frame I was given. I have taken it to my aquatic classes during Christmas and the ladies all loved it! Thank you Amazon and your extended family they do a really good job.Mahalo,Jeanne"
4,Very good pictures for 1.3 megapixels and small prints,"Good points:Very good pictures. Real glass lense (unlike the olympus D100 Brio which has a plastic lense).Colors are realistic (superior to the Canon A20).With USB port acts exactly like an external storage device (you can delete, save files on the camera which appears as an E: drive on your desktop).Macro mode for extreme close-upsAnd of course, it's a Sony product.Problems:Drains batteries very quickly.Menu cannot be accessed without having LCD picture on.Manual not always clear.Sony memory sticks are much more expensive than smartcards and other media."
2,Just OK there are probably better alternatives.,"I primarily bought this camera to put photos of stuff on e-bay. The camera is ok for this use, but I found the OEM Sony batteries to be unreliable and expensive. We got the error warning mentioned by others and the same cold reception from Sony. I warn others considering this or any digital camera to make sure it does not use a proprietary battery. For the cost of the Sony battery we were able to buy a charger and 4 NiMH 2200 mAh batteries. The camera cycles faster with the flash and it appears that we get more photos per charge, plus we have a back up set. I don't see a down side with the non-sony battery. On the otherhand it takes pretty good pictures and its easy to cheat the shutter for special effects. We get very good close ups, but I always use a tripod for these and I bracket shoot at a few distances. After all there is no film, why not take several shots and pick the best one?"
2,blurry close ups,"great little camera for taking people pictures,but if your an ebayer and need close ups of small items.like watches,forget it,it gets close to item but very blury...."
2,"Low priced, but expensive","This camera takes decent pictures, but is a real battery hog. You'll need to buy rechargeables or buy the battery pack offered by Sony. The memory stick supplied with the camera won't give you many pictures, so you'll also need to buy a bigger capacity stick.The LCD screen is fragile and easily broken. If that happens, you just have a paperweight."
3,No Secrets Here,"Useful, but no great secrets. Good research tool for someone starting in Real Estate, and has some useful tools on leverage understanding. I probably would not buy it again."
4,The Medici,"Series was very interesting, not only about the Medici family but also about the hisotry of Florence during the renaissance and the history of art during the same time."
4,Who knew the sex lives of corn could be so interesting?,"Like Linda Grant's previous books, this one is fast-paced and sharp with a nice touch of humor. No one seems more surprised than Catherine Saylor, childless career-woman that she is, when her gut reactions to her niece's wild behavior result in far more effective parenting than the girl gets from her own mother.The characters, even while most are involved in the same line of work, are carefully delineated. There's enough information about genetic research to indicate Grant's really done her homework, enough to help readers understand the issues behind the crimes without drifting off. The tense atmosphere of academic competition is convincing, and the murderer's not easy to spot."
5,Kabbala with a Gnostic twist,"The more one studies different religious traditions, the more one realizes how similar they are, orthodoxy aside. Being a follower of Dr. Hoeller, I tried this book and CD, but with low expectation of understanding it, having no knowledge of Kabbala. Well, no knowledge is needed to derive much from the reading and especially from the meditations on the major arcana Tarot cards. This is a great way to use the Tarot. Highly recommended."
4,Jabra BT800,"It works great, the charge lasts a couple of days. The only concern is that it is unconfortable to wear after a while."
3,wish it would fit better,"The sound quality from this unit is better than any other that I have tried and, I guess, that is the most important thing.That being said, it IS heavy and, worst of all, it does not fit worth a damn. It takes me a minute or so of two handed wrestling (so much for the safe-to-use-while-driving theory) to get it on and, when it is, it is not at all secure. You have to hold your head sort of like you would if you had a book balanced on top. Too sudden of a move and it will flap around and/or fall off. I even tried taking some of the excellent gells that came with my wired jabra unit and forcing them on to this one. I did some surgery on one with an exacto knife, but it was no go.All in all, when my phone rings while I am driving, I usually look over at the jabra (where it has fallen onto the passenger seat), sigh, and reach for my headset. Probably will end up on ebay."
3,BT 800 is great or not?,1. Great Design 2.LCD to catch caller ID 3.you call direct from menu list received number2. I used BT 800 with my i-mate jasjar; unfortunately sometimes second party says can not hear me well3. I have send e-mail to support center for Jabra and received message that they did not test4. I have Motorla H810 it works very well but sometimes I misconnection between H810 and i-mate
2,AWL,"It was fine until it suddenly quit working, however Amazon was fatastic with he way it was handled and my replacement was in hand in 3 days."
3,DVD Is anybody there?,Very upset that it was fixed to an area .... USA and Cananda and so it would not play in England. I didn't see a notice to this effect on the advert. Annoyed that it couldn't be watched.
4,Cute book,"This book is about Nick and Edie. Nick is the hott Italian popular stuck-up guy and Edie is Mega Nerd. This book basically has a plot reminiscent of She's All That. Popular guy and nerd. Friends dare him to ask nerd to the Prom. Popular guy while trying to convince nerd to go with him and becoming friends with nerd falls for her. Nerd finds out about dare. Boo-hoo. In the end everything is lovely. All in all it was a really cute book. A good pick. Plus, I loved all Mama Ling's fortunes at the beginnings of each chapter."
2,Not the book of choice,"It wasn't what I expected. Outdated, which I hadn't realized at first. There are better books out there. It has some good info."
3,Please help me...,"I've gone through the entire list of reviews for this soundtrack and I still have not found the song I'm looking for. When the trailer for ""Unfaithful"" first came out there was this song playing. It is popular now and has been used on numerous trailers since. It is on the current trailer for ""Vanity Fair"" with Reese Witherspoon. It is the last song at the very end of the trailer. If you find out please e-mail movieguy76@hotmail.com.Thanx!"
1,Unfaithful,"Talk about disappointed...I thought I was getting the great African music playing while they were dancing and all I got was ""music to slit your wrist by."" I rated it a ""1"" only because ""0"" wasn't available."
3,The song that everyone is looking for.,I bought this CD thinking that I would hear that awesome song from the Previews. I was wrong. It is a good cd if you saw the movie and liked the music score. Hint: Go to a Downloading Music place....put in the search unfaithful and it will show....
3,"Clever, cynical, convoluted.","There's plenty of standard Ross Thomas fare to be found in the pages of this fast paced, rather convoluted mystery. The Yellow-Dog Contract is narrated by its main character, Harvey Longmire, who, like most Ross Thomas protagonists, is a world weary cynic who's seen it all.Yet even Harvey is in for some surprises when he's called upon to find out why the national leader of an important labor union has gone missing. Most of the action unfolds in and around Washington, DC in the summer before the Presidential election of 1976. Savvy to the ways of Washington, Harvey sees political ramifications to this very high profile missing persons case, but can't quite put his finger on who or what might be behind it.Fast paced and clever, The Yellow-Dog Contract proved a bit too convoluted for my taste. A good effort, but clearly a lesser entry in the Ross Thomas canon."
1,Awful,"I LOVE picholine olives. Love them. I'm not really sure how these can even be advertised as such.I don't know what they're brined in, but it smells like toxic waste, and let me tell you, it doesn't taste much better. They must have been pasteurized or something. Instead of the firm, almost crunchy texture of a good picholine, they were mushy to the point where many of the olives were already crushed in the bag, despite the excellent shipping job.I wish I had heeded the other feedback and passed on these. They were a total waste of money, and I was very disappointed. If I could give this product negative stars, I would."
3,Not the pinacle of harmony,"I found this album through a search for Coope, Boyes and Simpson. I wish I hadn't believed the reviews. To me this sounds about as good as a decent church choir, no better. For me it just doesn't work well enough to be worthy of a top rating. Not something I need to listen to a third time. Twice was once too many. It's not bad, just not great."
1,Wrong CD,This is not the cd I thought it was. I was very fortunate and lucky they took it back. I thought it was Blue Murder but wrong group.
4,Just the thing to get the new year started right,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for a friend for Christmas. He loved it, and why shouldn't he? Twelve perfect men. My one-word review would be WOOF!"
4,ISAN - Clockwork Menagerie,"CLOCKWORK MENAGERIE, a collection of older and rare Isan tracks, emerge from the Boards of Canada school of IDM, but with a pedigree all its own. With simple melodies and rhythms, they craft outwardly benign songs with heavy emotional undercurrents thrumming beneath. ""Betty's Lament,"" for instance, is quietly beautiful, with a child's sense of wonder about the universe. But lest you think it's all melancholy and nostalgia, ""Damil 85"" comes along with a freeform wobbliness. Not all the tracks are as well-developed, however, but with short running times, they delight the ears just long enough to avoid getting too repetitive. The chiding vocal sample and childish tones of ""Rron"" is like Emily Post's music box. At turns subtle and beguiling, you can wind this clockwork up again and again."
5,"Streets of San Francisco - Season 3, Vol. 1 & 2","Streets of San Francisco... What a fantastic TV Series starring Karl Malden and Michael Douglas. If you're studying to be an actor, each episode is an acting lesson by Karl and Mike. The DVD third season is terrific as usual, as are seasons 1 and 2... the color and sound is vibrant and brings back so many wonderful 40 year old memories. I have the first 3 seasons and anxiously await the 4th, which is to be released in August 2012."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"I've never written a book review prior to this one. After getting half way through this book I felt I needed voice my opinion on one. However, I am concerned that maybe I expected too much after reading some of the positive reviews?This book contains too many errors to be considered a valuable resource. Many examples do not pertain to LM2, many of the downloadable files are not compatible with LM2, text refers to examples that are non existent, references are made to non-existent features, and the list continues. Having purchased over 30 software books over the past few years I can say with confidence this is the worst computer software related book I've ever purchased."
5,Enlightening,"Of all the books I've read on this subject, this one was the most enlightening as far as factual events. That said, I would add that it seemed the factual events were also presented with a healthy serving of the author's biased opinion. He had a few axes to grind and I got the impression he generally felt unappreciated. However, based on knowledge gleaned from other versions of the investigation, I'd say he had good reason to feel that way. Putting that aside, this is a well written book, and the author did a good job of organizing a massive amount of data into a very readable story. The result is that rare but wonderful combination of true events related in such a way that it reads like a spellbinding novel. If you've followed the Ramsey case over the years, you will dind this one well worth your time."
1,A book of trivia about Boulder with side-glances at the crim,"The major value of this book is to uncover the jealousy and in-fighting of the authorities of Boulder. It could best be described as an expose of how investigation of a major crime was almost totally botched from the beginning. The book is laced with trivia about the town and its citzens but does little to enlighten the reader as to the culprit. For those who like gossip, this is a winner."
3,Nobody's Perfect,"I'm about three quarters of the way through this book. It's of special interest to me as I went to high school with John Ramsey. IMHO, there's not a whole lot new in the book that I haven't already seen, heard or read about. It's an interesting read, but not the kind of book you can't put down. Perhaps the sequel, ""Not a Perfect Murder, Not a Perfect City,"" will be better."
2,Too many words.....too little information,"This book contains 600 pages with about 200 pages worth of content and information. In other words, the author had very little to say, but he appears to enjoy filling up pages with words. There aren't any big revelations in this book related to the JBR case. The only mystery to me is why Mr. Schiller felt the need to subject the reader to endless reams of useless information. Having said all that, this is the first time I've read anything written by this author. And having skimmed the last 350 pages of his essay (trying to discover anything worth the time and effort to read--which I failed to do), I can honestly say that I will not invest any more of my time reading any of his past (or future) offerings.Save your money on this one....go to your local branch of the public library and check this one out on loan."
1,Save Your Money !,"After the media build-up, this book was a big disappointment. It should have been titled ""Height Of Incompetency"" from the DA down. Nothing but the compilation of all the stories published and hashed over and over again on TV. Seems the author's goal was to get his share of the pot before the public lost interest."
2,"too many names and law, not enough about JonBenet!","This book is too focused on law and names. I couldnt keep the names straight, however there is a name index in the back, as well as the Ramseys Boulder home floor plans. Only one chapter is ""devoted"" to JonBenet.If you really want to read about JonBenet's life and death, read JonBenet by steve thomas.This book doesn't tell anything about JonBenet's life, and it definately doesn't keep her precious memory alive!Although the movie/dvd was excellent, this book wasnt very good. I would not reccommend this book!"
2,Choppy declarative style fails without a narrator-vehicle.,"A tightly-controlled seamless layout of the story would have made this difficult read (due to enormous numbers of characters, incidents, separate investigations, and opinions) more rewarding. This incredible subject suffers from the absolute lack of one, or two clearly defined and established narrators to weave the multiple scenarios together. This is a big failing in a story which deals with such a fragmented set of circumstances and oppositional mind-sets. The author's research has apparently been meticulous but the presentation is as erratic in feeling as the reported circumstances of the investigation and affects the reading enjoyment."
4,"Schiller's info is amazing, yet too honest and sad","From the moment I picked up this book, I would get angry when I had to put it down. There is so much information in here and I never realized how badly the investigation was hurt by the politics/pissing contests of the da/police involved. Schiller keeps his personal opinions to himself, he obviously wants to see justice for the killer of this girl. But anyone who reads this can read between the lines...Patsey Ramsey is not what she appears to be. It's so hard to figure out. It's a true whodunnit. I just like the fact that the information is so well laid out and researched and really easy to follow. I think Schiller needs to follow this one to the end though, and it just isn't over yet. I'll be waiting."
3,Not that it wasn't a good read...,"I've followed this sad case since Day 1 and I feel in my heart and soul that Jon-Benet's parents are innocent of this crime and that they have been through a particular kind of hell since their beloved daughter was brutally murdered by an intruder. That being said, I appreciate Lawrence Schiller (a very interesting guy) for leaving that avenue open. Unlike others, he did not jump to conclusions about ""who dunnit."" On the other hand, I didn't think that his approach (through the eyes of an unscrupulous tabloid journalist) was all that effective. I couldn't identify with the guy, and I've worked as a reporter myself. He describes the city of Boulder very well, and presents a story that to this day is a mystery."
1,Very Confusing,There were too many details in this book. I was given no insight to the case when reading this book (I couldn't finish it). I found myself unable to concentrate as too many facts were presented all at once.
1,Not impressed with the taste,"Unlike the other reviewer, I am pleased with the texture of this product but the taste of the Original or ""Natural"" flavor is not pleasant. I can't quite describe the taste. It's almost a medicinal flavor. Just at the start. Once you begin chewing the taste mellows."
4,dream book,"love dream books, i collect them. this one is pretty good. i got it for my daughter. its very detailed. i reccomend this book very much for people who want to look up their dreams in the morning."
2,not for anyone who believes in the spiritual,This author doesn't believe in precognitive dreams or dreams with messages for others. Without a basic understanding of what the mind is capable of how could any of these interpretations/information be accurate?
2,Meh,"This guy Tony Crisp is obsessed with sex. I think he's a little neo-Freudian in his schooling. Almost every dream I look up has something to do with sex. Come on, Tony, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. :)"
1,"Used is the word, pages yellow indication book many probably >10years old","Book is greatly used with earmarks and yellowing pages, I even have old paperback that are 20 years old but in mint condition"
5,Lunar is the sweetest RPG there is..........,"Lunar SSS is an amazing game. The storyline is so perfectly put together, and it's so moving. The old school graphics i think enhance the game by making it a little more fun. I play a lot of RPG's and i definitely think that the story in Lunar has not been surpassed by any other game. It is one of the greatest RPG's of all time."
4,RPG Lover's Find,"Having never played the original Sega version, I never really had any great expectations for this game. I reviewed it in gaming magazines and figured it would be worth the money. Was I ever right! There are absolutely fantastic animation scenes and music that really help to pull you inot the characters journey. It is neither to easy nor to hard. There is humor and angst. its an RPGers find for sure."
3,Came fast but missing stuff,"I'm happy that I got the game fairly quick but upon me getting it I opened up the package and found that the original soundtrack was missing and all of the books that the game came with are gone. I know the original artwork isn't vital to how the game plays but I at least want all four disks, not three. Came with disk 1, 2, dvd, and original soundtrack is missing but oh well i'll still play it regardless."
4,It's back and I'm impressed,"In 1994, Sega CD owners were introduced to an incredible RPG titled Lunar. Five years later, Playstation owners got to enjoy the experience for themselves. In my opinion, this is the best RPG of 1999. It may not have the pretty graphics of the recent Final Fantasy games, but the story line, strategic battle system, and well done anime, make it thirty hours that are completely relentless. The dialog is very humorous, but I warn you that some of it may be inapropriate for young children. The voice acting was ok, but I didn't care to much for Alex's voice. Overall, any true RPG fan should get this game, that is, if you can find it!"
4,"An amazing game filled with laughter,fun, and action.","This was one of the most amazing games I have ever played. I got so into it, too. Anyone who gets this game is bound to get into it like I did. The animation was great and very detailed. The color was perfect and the characters were hilarious. It has a great storyline and everything. It was so heart felt and the end was so powerful. The fighting is original and skillful at the same time. If it was any game I would get this one. It takes good strategies and skill to play this game. Anyone can really play it though. There's plenty of tricks in the game also. Almost anyone would love this game. It has its action, comedy, romance, great animation, fighting skills, magic, short movies, and much more. This is definetly a great game to get."
4,Lunar: A classic for almost anyone!,"Lunar:Silver Star Story Complete is one of the best games I have ever played. Not for the graphics(what do you expect, it's a Sega CD remake), characters(well, I did like most of them), or for a unique feature, but for the story and the solid gameplay involved.A short summary: Lunar is about a kid named Alex living in the town of Burg, several miles from the mainland. He dreams of becoming a hero, and gets his chance when his best friend Ramus decides to go on an adventure. Together with his childhood sweetheart Luna and his annoying pet Nall, they go on a series of adventures that definately end up where you wouldn't suspect.For fans of Lunar, Working Designs, RPGs, and solid gameplay, this is for you. If graphics really affect you or you hate RPGs, then you might have second thoughts."
5,"Durable, fun and very colorful...","After you have helped your children break the sound code with the First Steps to Reading Series Phonics Cards (ISBN: 0789442604), you can continue with all the other Flash cards in this series.This set has cards with a colorful picture on one side and the word on the other. You can point to each picture and say the word, then encourage your child to read the words on their own. You can play fun games with the cards, by laying them out and saying a word. Then, your child has to find the card.Your child will learn words like: table, towel, cushion, etc. This pack will help children recognize words and should be used along with the Phonics Cards pack.The fun thing about this pack is you can have your child find the objects in your house that match the cards. There is a ""Note to Parents and Teachers"" to give you many fun ideas for teaching these words."
4,Lots of fun in the tub,"I actually had put this on my daughter's wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because I just couldn't wait to see if she'd get it for her 1st birthday. I always take tubbies with my daughter so I like to have fun toys in the tubby that I enjoy too. My daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too - I have to admit I play with it more than she does at this point. She's only 9-1/2 months right now so I think as she gets a bit older she'll enjoy it more. My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof. Other than that, a fun toy. After I got this, I did find it at Target for the same price it's listed here with no s&h charges but still don't regret getting it."
1,terrible!,I couldn't agree more with the guy from Australia; this CD is aweful compared to the France '98 CD. I was very disappointed. The artists are soooooooo lame. One of the worst CD purchases I ever made.
2,"Repin is excellent, Gergiev is not","Repin's performance of these 2 concertos is excellent. He captures the mood and technical difficulties superbly, however, Gergiev tempos are much too fast in the Tchaikovsky, which lessens the beauty of this work and forces Repin to play too fast. I just could not savor the music and the phrasing. Much of the nuances get lost, and it does not add to the drama as you might expect a fast tempo to do. Philips recording has a problem with balance. Repin's violin is much too loud compared to the orchestra which lessens the impact of the crescendos. The Myaskovsky concerto is good, but I would agree with one review that recommended Oistrakh performance (available on Classica D'Oro #9006 or #2010 or Pearl #9295) or get Grubert's performance on Naxos (ASIN: B0000DJEM3). For the Tchaikovsky, I highly recommend the Milstein/Abbado recording on Decca 460619, which captures the phrasing, poetry, beauty and drama of the Tchaikovsky."
4,Eye of The Pyramid - great story line though needing editing,"Although poorly edited and needing some tough love for some of the plot spoiling by the author, the story line is unique and is a captivating tale.For a novel that was apparently produced without the assistance of a professional publisher to polish the rough edges, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the plot and the creativity of the intrigue. There is ample complexity in the historical references, and the author has earned my respect for his overall courage in tackling history's secret society conspiracy and the gold cartel with his very first book. The tie-in to the Coral Castle was both unique and fitting, and I enjoyed it immensely."
2,Very disappointing,"The whole 'Dolphin Diaries' series was started by Lucy Daniels. Mr Baglio is v. disappointing and not nearly as good as Mrs Daniels. I mean, how would u feel if someone else wrote the next Harry Potter book when from the name it didnt even sound like the person had anything to do with JK Rowling? In my opinion- Baglio is an imposter and it was hardly even worth buying the book in the first place."
4,Excellent Resource for Biblical Studies,"I do not even remember where I purchased this book at but it has been an invaluable tool for both OT and NT studies in my pursuit of understanding the ancient wisdom traditions. The title of the book can be pleasantly deceiving. Crenshaw goes well beyond the wisdom tradition found in the biblical books of Ecclesiates, Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. He takes a broader perspective and includes apocrapha writings as well as Egyptian and Mesopotamian literature. I have found this book to be a very thorough, concise, and well orgainized book, much appreciated for students working under time constraints. This book has proven to be invaluable for exegesis of both OT and NT passages that make reference to ancient wisdom traditions. It is simple to read and has a great biblography that aids in indepth study of the word."
3,An easy summer night's read,"I have been a Stuart Woods fan since ""Santa Fe Rules.""With that said, I would like to add that while ""Orchid Beach"" is not the best book I've read this year, it's certainly not the worst (""Cold Heart"" holds that dubious honor), either. I found the story of Holly Baker and her new assignment as Chief of Police in Florida's Orchid Beach a light, fun, easy summer night's reading.I, too, believe the mystery was a bit far-fetched...someone would have noticed all the air traffic...but, it's not Proust...it's a good, fast, fluffy read. I'd like to see more Holly/Daisy episodes...and I liked Jackson, too.My final word: Not Proust, but not bad, either. Enjoy!"
3,Couldn't Put It Down!!!,"I was up all night reading this book! I am a big Detective novel buff and this book filled my need for mystery. I found the dog Daisy to be a wonderful bonus character. Although, I did think that the book began to move a little fast once the FBI became involved. The whole focus of Holly's investigation into the Cheif's murder became a little unfocused. And I found it a little hard to believe that Ham, Holly's military father, just decided to retire and move to Orchid Beach to help.....a far stretch. But, over all I enjoyed the novel and can't wait to read more of Stuart Wood's work!"
3,"Predictable, but easy summer reading.","This book is an entertaining crime novel with few surprises. ""Daisy"" should have had a bigger part! A quick read - perfect for the airport or beach. I'll try another of his books."
1,i would perfer no star at all if possible!,"this can be truly the most horrible book by ms. coulter. she's my favortie author, and she still is after this book. she put genny through so many humiliating moments! it'z really embarrassing for her! and alec is so arrogant and such a jerk! ms. coulter gave alec too much control over genny and this is the worst book i've ever read!"
3,the only recording of this gem.,"This rock musical version of ""The Two Gentlemen of Verona"" won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1972. Oddly, the reasoning of that honor doesn't translate on this disc. The score is fun, clever, infectious and irresistable, but you have to try (very hard) to look past the awful vocals that ruin it. It's a great musical, just don't expect too much from the performances on here. Why has it not been revived on Broadway yet?? Until it is, this is the only recording available."
4,George Strait: Strait Out of the Box,"If you like George Strait, you'll love this set of four cds. I like the older songs, and my daughter likes the newer, so this is an ideal set for us. It has everything."
5,must have for any george fan!,"I purchased this right when it came out in stores,its the cobo of all his seperate best of packages stored into 4 cds. this is one of the best purchases i have ever made, i have sveral best of from other country singers at this is right up there w/ the dolly parton collection that also happens to be a box set. if you are a true country fan then you will have this in your collection."
2,Rockport leather is stiffer,This replaced an older Rockport shoe that was much better made. This has to be broken in. Have to find a replacement for this brand that I have used for years.
4,Very light and comfortable!,These shoes are very comfortable and they are as light at sneakers. They don't look as sleek in real life as they do in the pictures but overall satisfied.
3,"Feel great, look fair.","These shoes were somewhat comfortable right out of the box and after a week of break in they are very comfortable all day, even walking around alot. That's what I selected Rockports for, and they are living up to their reputation in that area.However, in person the uppers have the look of a less expensive shoe, like the department store house brand that is similar to the high quality shoes in style but only costs half as much. If these cost less, I'd easily give them another star, but for the price my perception is they're somewhat lacking in this area.So far the workmanship appears to be solid."
1,Disappointed,"I bought a pair in oxblood several years ago and found them to be very comfortable. When I needed a new pair of black shoes I felt safe in ordering the Ellingwood model online because I already knew they fit well. What I didn't anticipate was while the shoe upper is still made of leather, the tongue (which is not considered part of the upper) is now ""man-made"". The stiff plastic-like material is not pliable and the edge digs into my ankle as I stride, making the shoe unwearable."
5,&#51339;&#51008; &#49888;&#48156;&#51077;&#45768;&#45796;.,"&#44397;&#45236;&#44032;&#48372;&#45796; &#51200;&#47156;&#54616;&#44592;&#46020; &#54616;&#44256;, &#44305;&#51060; &#50557;&#44036; &#51080;&#45716;&#44163; &#50808;&#50640;&#45716; &#47561;&#49888;&#44592; &#51339;&#51008; &#49888;&#48156;&#51077;&#45768;&#45796;.&#54616;&#51648;&#47564; &#50864;&#47532;&#45208;&#46972;&#50640;&#49436; &#44396;&#47588;&#54616;&#44592;&#50640;&#45716; &#49888;&#48156; &#51333;&#47448;&#47484; &#50504;&#54036;&#44592;&#50640; &#49324;&#51060;&#51592;&#50640;&#49436;&#45716; &#46020;&#51204;&#54644;&#48372;&#49492;&#50556; &#54624;&#46319;.&#44396;&#46160;&#49324;&#51060;&#51592; 260&#51064; &#49324;&#46988;&#51060; 8.5EE &#49344;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;."
2,Not what was excepted,I have always liked rockports but these shoes just don't look like leather shoes. I also need shoes without metal shanks and it appears all rockports have them now. I sent them back.
4,Definitely Live Up to Their Waterproof Statement,"I work in finance and must wear dress shoes five days per week. Somebody recommended Rockports as being a fantastic all-weather dress shoe. They were correct. I stepped out of my car into a 1.5 inch deep puddle of water the other day and my feet, toes, and socks were all still completely dry. I was on a phone call and didn't realize I was standing in water for about five minutes. Needless to say, these worked as advertised. They are also comfortable, breathe decently, and don't scuff. Buy them. You won't regret it."
3,"slim for the size, smells unhealthy like many cheap chinese products","My third pair of Rockport Shoes!Although I never order shoes online, Rockport is an exceptionbecause they cannot be bought in Germany and they produce shoescomfortable as sports shoes but wearable with a business suit.But this pair is not as comfortable and fits tighter (although same size!)compared to the model 'Evander Oxford' which I ordered last year, andwhich I can recommend as a comfortable shoe for business.But maybe they have to be worn in..... (is this correct english?)T.S., Germany"
5,Great buy!,"I wanted a pair shoes with style, ""corporate finance"" look, very comfortable, and inexpensive. With this pair of Rockport Ellingwoods, I got all that I was looking for. I am very happy with my purchase and I fully recommend it."
1,will not buy it again,It makes weird noise when walking on the hard surface. It is uncomfortable for long walk.
4,Go Flames Go!,"The series 4 figures are getting harder and harder to find. If you're an Iginla fan, pick this up while you still can. There will be a 2nd Iginla figure released in the upcoming Series 10 lineup.Mcfarlane toys are always great for their attention to detail and life like look and feel. Great toys at great prices!"
4,WOW,"AT first, I gotta admit, I did not really like it. But I kept thinking about it, and I knew there was more to this movie.The acting is unreal, excellent, the best. There is no doubt. John and Goodman.. WOW.I read other's reviews, and then I pondered, YES.. this was a great movie. It has so much more then other westerns. It explores more, it reaches farther, and give it a try.. I doubt you will not be pleased it touched your life."
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed this movie, it was done well for the time. Once watching, I got immersed into the story, and did some cursing at some of the people in it. It is based on a real happening and I was happy it stuck to the story. Tho I didn't like the ending, and could have strangled the one man who caused it, it did follow the real story. The countryside was awesome.maj"
4,The Jack Bull,Not as good as I had hoped. It has been a while since I watched it. Probably will not watch it again. Don't know why I spend good money on movies I know so little about. Guess I was just in one of those moods.
3,3 1/2 stars for a good story,"Better than average drama and suspense that reasonably captivates the audience. Elements of Billy Jack and Rob Roy, yet improves on them and/or varies them enough to hold interest. Caliber of acting is good but not excellent. Lessons of ""here's what happens when good people take the law into their own hands"" could have been much better developed."
2,metal part broke after 14 months,"I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DISPENSER. EASY TO USE, FILLS FROM THE TOP, MATCHES MY FAUCET. LAST WEEK, AFTER 14 MON THS OF USE, IT SNAPPED ALONG A THREAD OF THE BRASS CONNECTOR UNDER THE SINK??? NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND A PLASTIC PART BREAKING, BUT A METAL??? I WOULD LIKE TO GET ANOTHER, BUT AM PERPLEXED AS TO WHY THE METAL PART SNAPPED OFF! DOES DISHWASHING LIQUID CORRODE IT???"
3,A mixed bag,"I chose this dictionary and phrasebook because i knew that pronunciation would be a challenge and I wanted a resource that was strong in that area. I do feel it succeeds in that regard, as well as such a small volume could with a language as difficult and nuanced as Thai. However I found that a number of simple and often used words are not found in it, e.g. thank you!"
4,Good quality cage,"All in all I'm very happy with this purchase. It would have been much easier to assemble with two people, but I managed in pretty good time on my own. The shelf insert goes in easily, and there's a fitted fleece cover for the ramp, but I eventually opted not to use them. Both would need some modification before I'd consider them hedgehog safe, but I can't count this against the rating. The little plastic plugs that go on the very top of the frame don't fit--though with a little encouragement from a hammer, who knows, it might work. I didn't think they were worth it, really. The wheels lock in the front and move decently well on carpet. It doesn't look like it will warp easily, which is a definite plus.However, the main reason I bought this cage was for the easy access through the front doors. Cleaning days take half the time they used to. The bottom shelf is small enough to fit inside a normal kitchen trash bag, which was an unexpected bonus."
5,Hits one out of the park,"For anyone who has played little league, watched little league or can spell little league, this book will entertain and inform. Mitchell weaves a sweet tale mixing a year in the life of his son's pint-sized team with little league history and other baseball tid bits ranging from Bruce Springsteen's perspective on coaching to life as a 60's radical. But the majority is on his lovable A's as they battle their way to the playoffs and encounter angry coaches, overbearing parents, and an alien mascot along the way. It's all Apple Pie and mom's cookies, but it works. Batter up!"
1,never got it,like the shorts I never got the jump rope either and it's paid for please send it to me A.S.A.P.
3,A Bit Boring,"I hate to be the voice of dissent, but this album was a bit hit-and-miss for me. I just couldn't get into some of the tracks, and it gets a bit repetitious. This album did not stand up to repeated listening for me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the tracks, and the instrumentation is quite good (hence three stars)."
3,Nice looking but inconsistent quality,"I purchased these boxes in a few different sizes for my office. They look great, and made it easy to get organized without spending too much money. I have found, however, that the snaps which hold the boxes together are of inconsistent quality. Some are very difficult to get snapped, and others are so loose you cannot count on them to stay snapped. For my purposes, the boxes work well, because I use them to store things I only get into occassionally. I would not recommend these boxes for moving things around a whole lot, as they have a tendency to spontaneously disassemble when overused."
3,Salmon jerky product review,"Great flavor although the majority of the pieces were a little dry and brittle when I was expecting a more moist consistency. Overall, pretty good product that I would buy again."
1,Awful,"Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed. They put no expiration date on the bags so I don't even know if I was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way. On top of this, they were too spicy. My dog seemed to enjoy it though.The Ahi tuna, on the other hand, was great."
3,Good Product for Short-Term Strengthening,"The product was helpful for a few weeks. The greatest resistance isn't that challenging though. If you continue to get stronger and increase the resistance every use, this product will only last you two months at best. It is a better choice than grip strengtheners that cannot vary in resistance though."
4,Not Bad,"To me, this was one of the most anticatped CD's of the year. He is an underrated MC though. Wild Grimilinz is not that impressive. Some of the songs are wack and have wack beats. His lyrics are good. My favorite songs are ""Get Gully"",""Supa High"", and ""What Cha Want"". Nas, Foxy, AZ, and Cormega's albums are better though."
5,Cohen exposes the petty reasons for cartoon censorship,"Cohen does a remarkable job illustrating the history of cartoon censorship. From Walt Disney's Song of the South and its questionable portrayal of African American's to the altering of the hemline of Betty Boop's dress, Cohen explores significant and petty reasons for censorship. He also discusses how cartoonists would sometimes censor themselves. A discussion of pre code cartoons, such as the early Betty Boop pictures, is also included. Truly a superb book for anyone interested in cartoon censorship."
4,Heavy duty! Worth the money!,It's a great buy. Very heavy duty! We hang lots of clothes on and this coat rack stays very stable.
2,Topples easily,"Flimsy - that is the word that comes to mind immediately after the easy assembly of this rack is done and you hang the first coats on it.Don't even think of putting your heavy winter coats and jackets there, unless you balance the weight perfectly. Hanging two coats on one side, and one coat on another side will, depending on the accumulated weight for each side, lead to either a leaning tower effect, or a downright fall.The diameter of the four base legs is just too small to support anything else then a mostly centered distribution of items. And the hooks do not shine by the sturdiest attachment to the pole one could imagine.One positive aspect of this rack is that it has a very small footprint and thus fits into tight spaces (thus the second star ...). But that comes with a price - see above."
2,It does the job,It does the job but looks cheap and wobbles. Only good for a corner somewhere where nobody can see it.
4,Purse Organizer,"I purchased the coat rack with organization in mind. I have placed my purses and scarfs on the coat rack. Now they are handy, and because they are so handy I tend to change purses more often and remember to grab a scarf that goes with my outfit. And it looks good in my bedroom, an added touch to the decor."
3,not too bad for the price,The product arrived fast and was very easy to put together. The quality was decent for the price and great for hanging up ligher stuff like shirts and pants but might not hold up a heavy winter jacket. Used for our bedroom for the kids to hang up their PJs and shirts.
4,Very functional.,"When I bought a coat rack, I was looking to spend as little money as possible in order to obtain something that would hold my coats and hats off the floor without falling over. This coat rack indeed cost as little money as any coat rack I could find, and indeed does not fall over when all of my half-dozen coats and numerous hats and scarves are placed on it. It also looks almost like it might serve as a useful weapon in case of a zombie invasion."
4,Surprising,"I bought this for hanging up wet beach towels and bathing suits out on our lanai. I was pleasantly surprised how sturdy this rack is. Even though it's a bit light in weight, it's so well made that it's never tipped, even under the weight of all those wet, heavy items. The box it shipped in was bulging because it was really too small for the pieces, but everything inside was okay and it was super easy to put together. I would buy this rack again even at a higher price, but at this low price ($25.00) it's worth every penney."
4,Nice Rack!,This coat rack was easy to put together. It holds my heavy coats well and keeps things I don't have a place for off the ground. Good product.
1,only part shipped,"This product arrived w/o an assembly manual, nor any accessories. Terrible, although i know how to assemble it but i don't have accessories. just a bunch of iron bar!!"
3,A solid first outing.Well done boys!,A solid first outing from some hometown bros.One reviewer compared them to the goo goo dolls---don't think so.These guys might surprise us.Keep up the good work!
4,Juicy Box Holder,So yeah like everyone else I assumed you got three in a pack. Just so you all know you can get a pack of three at walmart.com for 5.94 (and ship it to the store for free)!!! Except for the deceiving ad this is a great product.
5,good hardcore stuff,"Vsnares releases yet another awesome record. The album description above says that it's probably his most danceable record yet, but I disagree. Chocolate Wheelchair still carries that honor in my opinion, but this is still quality shizz. It's mostly in a heavy gabber style, but much more refined than, say, Making Orange Things. All those pounding distorded kicks are countered by some of Snare's more intricate breakage and always seems fresh, even though gabber isn't usually my cup of tea. It's not a surprise that the tone is very aggressive, considering the title and names of tracks, but they always have that Snares sense of humor (for example the sample of Isabella Rossellini in ""The Saddest Music in the World"" talking about beer and Winnipeg) to balance everything out.Technically, this record is billed as an E.P., but at 45 minutes long it's virtually another entire concept album by the great Venetian Snares. 5 stars, as if ANYTHING by Snares is ever less than genius."
2,"honestly, a disappointment","honestly, a disappointment... not bcoz these guys aren't good, they are.but even at window shaking (neighbour calling five-o) volume, i still didn't get the sense of their fun parties...my mistake, djs spinning is betta than the wav version!for die-hard fans only!"
3,Meditation Made Too Easy,"Meditation Made Easy was very well written, organized and with both humor and clear examples of how to meditate. The problem I had with the book was how Mr. Roche continually made it seem like we were already meditating by many of the things we do in our everyday lives----such as daydreaming or contemplation. I think there is some truth to what he says, but too often he made it sound like no effort is needed to meditate. From 30 years of various forms of meditation I know that in fact it does take effort----a lot of effort. However, in Mr. Roche's defense, I think what he had to say, overall, will enable those who are interested in meditation to at least get started."
4,high quality,"This is a high quality box-cutter type utility knife: solid;sturdy; strong, secure blade; good grip."
5,Missionarys from China,"No help needed. The Chinese Christians, pure and undefiled by persecution and suffering are now advancing the Gospel westward to Jerulsalem. Through the 10/40 window to a people who have not heard the good news of Jesus Christ. They do need our finances and our prayers. They are poised to succeed."
2,This book doesn't know who it's audience is,"This book goes through 4 examples of real webpages and how they might be done. The book is written by four people and that's probably where the issue is.It sounds like the book is aimed towards beginners, but touches on some advanced topics. It touches a little on CSS, a little on PHP/mysql, a little on design in general, etc It just sounds like the four authors didn't coordinate well.If you are an advanced user, this book may be good in finding out how to do certain functionalities easier with dreamweaver, but still too much writing to read for that use. You may consider just getting a Dreamweaver reference manual by somebody else in that case."
4,So close to being perfect...,"This is the ideal place for new Matthew Sweet fans to start. Great songs, pulled evenly from his best albums... and for once the two new songs are actually worthy of inclusion on a career spanning best-of. The song selection can't be argued with too much... UNTIL the ""Time Capsule"" hits the ""Blue Sky On Mars"" album. Leaving off the killer songs ""Come To California"" and ""Into Your Drug"" in favor of the far less interesting ""Behind The Smile"" is the only serious mistake. On the other hand, the glorious ""Someone To Pull The Trigger"" DID make the cut... and that's a very, very good thing."
3,Name is somewhat misleading...,"This is an excellent collection, but it does not include any material from ""Earth"" or ""Inside""."
1,It must Be Good,"It was sampled in Fatboy Slims ""Soul Surfing"" which was in his top selling album ""Youve Come Along Way Baby"". Lets face it we all new Norman Cook wasn't the one playing the guitar."
3,A bit of a letdown,A bit of a letdown. The pendant is only the size of a dime and the chain is quite thin. The stones are nowhere near the same color intensity as the photo wants you to believe. I'm curious as to the cost of the lens used to take the product photo. The necklace came in a small ziplock bag and I spent 20 minutes untangling it and the clasp isn't something I'm confident in. I am tempted to return it
3,It's Okay,"Well I got this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she loved it. That is why it gets three stars out of me. I do agree that the chain is a bit too thin, but that wasn't a big deal. I just bought a different chain with it. Amazon has plenty to choose from. It was smaller than it looks in the picture, and from the side it isn't the most beautiful piece, but it looks nice from the front. The very bottom diamond was loose, but I gave it a little push, and it seemed to click into the setting and has stayed firm. Overall I think it was a good purchase for what it costs, but next time I buy jewelry I'm probably not going to do it online. At least that way I'll know what I'm paying for."
3,"Less than 1/2 inch high, cheap chain","Not hard to see why it's on sale. I would not have paid full price. It is pretty, but it's very small."
3,pretty nice,"its nice and it makes a great gift, consider buying another necklace with it because the one that comes with it breaks fast"
4,"Not large, but very nice.","This pendant is really nice, and my girlfriend really loves it. Can't say much else if this is the style you are looking for. Good buy."
5,Live jazz at its very best,"For real jazz fans, two words suffice for this recording: Get it. El Pampero is one of the greatest live jazz recordings ever made, a showcase for the soaring tenor saxophone of Gato Barbieri and a primer on what spontaneous jazz music can aspire to at its most passionate and joyous. The ensemble work by Gato's partners on this outing is superb. And after all these years, I still believe that the way Gato Barbieri weaves the hypnotic folk music of South America into the very North American textures of mainstream jazz points the way to the future for this still vibrant form of music."
5,el pampero,"This Album is absolutely awesome. The intensity of the first track in particular parallels Coltrane's playing. Some might be put off by the timbre of Gato's ""voice"" shrieking and screaming. Not one of mom's favorite albums. This recording is for real."
4,Punk /Hippie Jam Collision: With Great Results,"This album, an originally double vinyl set but here on one disc, is a wonderful example of instrumental only punk experimentalism. That is, primarily punk musicians pushing the boundaries of what their music could be, without the constraints of words, into multifarious styles or jams of impressive execution. One could say that this album is treading the line between the aesthetics of hippies & punkers.From Greg Ginn's inside-out Deep Purple riffs with Black Flag/Gone to the scenic Cali-jams of Pell Mell, Paper Bag, Lawndale, & the Alter-natives to the NYC art-damage scene via Renaldo, Sharp, & Kaiser to the free jazz crescendos of Universal Congress Of--this album blew my mind when it first came out, & still does.With modern instrumental bands like Mogwai & godspeed you! black emperor still holding to the spirit of punk, no matter where they stylistically go with their music, makes me realize that such an attitude, perhaps, started here. . . ."
2,"Good Car Charger, Poor Battery","I mainly bought this item for the car charger as my last one broke. The car charger seems to be the real deal, but the battery is clearly refurbished. It won't hold a charge for very long and it wouldn't work in my husband's slightly older Razr model. I had to switch it to my newer Razr and give him the battery from mine. Needless to say, despite the good deal on the car charger, we will now be forking out more money for a battery. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Charger good; Batttery was OLD can't hold charge,"Received shipment in a couple of days. Charger works great but battery will not keep charge for a whole day. Even when not using phone. The battery manufactured date was in 2006. Battery appears to be OEM but possibly old stock. I do not know how to contact seller. Threw packing slip away with packaging which had seller info on it. But, just found a way to contact seller through Amazon. Seller comments are very positive so the seller should take care of any issues that I have."
4,Battery Only So-so at Holding Charge but Easily Worth $,"The battery and car charger both appear to be original Motorola equipment and the charger works perfectly. However the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge as well as I recall my original battery did when I first bought my phone three or four years ago. Still, at this price, it's a great deal and the battery definitely works better than my original one, which is now pretty worn-out."
5,the wolves at the door,"Amazing true story about a heroic womanduring World War II. An American Spy, oneof the best during the war. A great bookand a story that has to be told. Excellent."
5,"Suspenseful, never dull, wonderfully researched","Kudos to the author, Judith Pearson. I almost always prefer first person accounts of those who lived through WWII. However, this book gripped me throughout the narrative. This would make a wonderful movie with Virginia Hall played by an actress of Cate Blanchett's caliber. Exhaustively researched and well written. Thank you Ms. Pearson, I'll be looking for your next book!"
5,The best CD out so far in 1999 next to Bsb's 'Millennium'!!!,"WOW!!! This self-titled CD by Billy Crawford rocks, it should be number 2 on the billboard charts (right next to bsb's cd which is #1 at the moment). This 17 year old can not only sing but also dance and act. This CD is definatly worth the money no questions asked, no doubt. This boy has soul and has talent. I hope that he will become as popular as BSB are right now. He's no fake everybody, he's the real deal (no milli vanilly (we don't even sing our songs, we r just good looking stuff)). I love all the song's on his CD espically 'mary lopez', 'urgently in love' and 'our night'. He's not in the music business for the money, he's in it for the love of performing for thosands of people and more. What else can I say really he's terrifc. he's so good that it is hard to put into words how good his music is and how hot and good he is. Buy his CD plz. I love u Billy."
2,"Great Movie, Lousy DVD","This delightful movie by David Lean deserves a much better transfer/print than the one present in this DVD. Hopefully, nah, make that ""surely"" this will happen some time in the future, as it almost always does. If you can't wait to own this film on DVD, go for it. But beware, the colors are either washed out, too yellow or too green, and the sound is very poor (despite the Dolby Digital Mono) and most of the dialogue is practically incomprehensible. The quality of this DVD is in fact so poor that it is completely distracting, such that you spend more time struggling to imagine what the film would look and sound like in the right version than enjoying what it is."
4,Trio Fan,"In spite of the less than stellar audio quality, this is an excellect compendium of the history of the trio over the past 50 years."
5,A great gift,I got this for my son (23 years old) for Christmas and he hasn't stop watching. Season 1 is hysterical!
2,meh,"Should have known something was up by how low the price was for such a big piece of cat furniture. Got it and the handles ripped when I tried bringing it through the door as the box was apparently too heavy to actually use the handles. The directions are horrible and I figured out I was missing pieces as I went along. I decided to try building it without the instructions as they weren't much help and that's how I figured out there was a base missing, screws missing and some sections seemed like they would be chincy even with the right construction. Contacted the company it's made by and waiting on a response as to what to do from here."
1,Ugh.,"Incomplete parts, terrible tiny page of ""directions."" After wrestling with it for hours, I gave up and now I have two small and separate cat trees. I would not buy this brand again."
1,"Good for a Gag, Literally.","This piece is one of the worst I have ever had the unfortunate task of reviewing. The story never comes to complete fruition and the english language has been horribly hacked. Words have been strung together, but I could not consider giving this the title of ""book."" I am certainly glad that the royalties are being donated to the Red Cross. Goodness knows the author is undeserving."
5,"Thank you for a great book, Dr. Gray!","I think that this book would be a big help for anyone who's suffered a loss in their life. If you never mourn and recover from your losses in a healthy way, you will remain stuck and repeat the same unhealthy patterns over and over again.What's great about this book is that you are pretty much free to skip around and read the parts that pertain to your personal situation. But I recommend going back and reading all of it because most of us have a lot of learn about ourselves...and the opposite sex. A+ for John Gray, PhD. I will definitely buy more of his books."
1,Save your Money,"I thot the original Venus & Mars book insightful, but I think Gray is riding his own wave with this one. It's a -lot- of padding around a very few (and retreaded) ideas. Nutshell: (1) After a divorce/wife's death, men remarry too quickly, usually within 6-12 months. Mistake. (2) Especially after a divorce, women tend to shy away from relationships, perhaps for years. Unfortunate. (3) This is the nugget I took away from this book (which is why you should save your money!): **Don't get into a relationship until you don't need one.** If you haven't read the original book, get that one, but don't bother with this one."
2,dangerous advise!,"While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their ""healing"" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way!"
4,Worth the read,"I found the book very helpful in its discussion of how to be ready to move on from an ended relationship, which in my case was the death of a spouse. But I saw issues many people I know have in ending a marriage by divorce or just breaking up too. To me the most important point was that you not only have to mentally move on but your heart has to be healed and ready to move on. You have to get past the anger and resentment stages of ""grief"" over the loss or breakup. It gave some excellent ways on how to accomplish this."
5,It Really Is So Darn Easy,"Reading Dr. Boriosi's book is like sitting across from him and talking to the soft spoken, smiling man. The book explains in the simplest terms how to find peace within yourself and work throught the bumps in life. It is a wonderful reference book to be kept near at hand. I sincerely hope we see more of Dr. Boriosi's therapy put into book form."
5,The Best Old School Full Length Freestyle Album in Years!!,"If you love freestyle from back in the day and have waited for something new, wait no more! Listen to ""If I Had The Chance"", ""I Never Said"", ""Save Your Love For Me"" and remember exactly what Freestyle is - Love songs with a PHAT BEAT!! FIVE STARS for a true Freestyle album from a true Freestyle Fan."
3,Not recommended for LG cu500,"The card is nice and it works, but the cu500 phone could not pick it up very easily. I did a bunch of searching and tweaks within the phone to get the card to be read by the phone."
5,The Mechanics of Envy,"It's hard to believe that nearly 2 milleniums of envy and persistence in converting the Jewish people actually led to the downfall of Papal control over most of Italy. This book has a lesson to it, which even today is still not heeded. Brilliant historical account of a minor ""round up the usual suspects"" scenario which backfires."
5,9/11!,"I came upon After 9/11 from a link after being thoroughly disappointed by the brief work by Noam Chomsky on September 11th. Chomsky's line has become predictable and overplayed - the lack of US morality in foreign policy, the mainstream media blackout of issues, the tyranny of capitalism, and so on. Books like After 9/11 are a breath of fresh air when compared to the dogma that dominates most widely-published left intellectuals.After 9/11 covers a whole spectrum of issues related to the tragedy , going on the traditional political and economic analysis of the causes of the terrorist attacks. There are articles covering issues like labor, activism, commercialized patriotismeven hip-hop and post-traumatic sex!This is a refreshing work, and I only wish it was more visible in the consciousness of Americans (Has anyone seen this title in bookstores)."
3,So- So,"I got this CD mainly for Lil Red Riding Hood. The version on this CD must be an alternate version -- it doesn't sound anything like the song we oldies fans are familiar with. And the whole CD seems to have been recorded at very low volume. If you're looking for just a few of these songs that you can't easily find anywhere else, this CD is more than worth the low price you can find here. But otherwise you might be better off getting greatest hits collections from your favorite artists."
5,ZZ Top - Greatest Hits - The Video Collection,I am a ZZ Top fanatic of course I am going to like this.
2,Maybe,"Five miles down the road after installing the Fram Air Hogg filter, My check engine light came on.Maybe the filter caused it, maybe not."
1,Title Misleading,"I was surprised to find this book very unhelpful in my new tutoring business. It mainly discusses the relationship between the tutorer and tutoree and provides no information on tutoring techniques, etc. A real disappointment!"
1,A Waste of Money!,"This is a horrible book. The explanation of the book is hard to understand. The pictures are limited, not a wide variety. You have your 5 basic hands, that's it. It doesn't give a clear answer. For a great book about palmistry that is easy to understand try ""Instant Palm Reader"". If you choose to buy this book...good luck!"
2,25 tranquil classics mostly good songs harp a bust,"selection of music for the most part was good. the angel who played the harp had to be tone ddaf. the bask ground sounds added nothing to good music selections. i have heard of painting by the numbers, but someone forgot to either number the harp strings so the angel could pick the rightnotes."
4,Very Informative,"As a soon to be lawyer as Mr. Horrow, this is a very informative book as to the world of Sports Business. He really provides insight into all aspects of Sports, including the political battles. This book is very encouraging and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the business aspect of sports."
2,Ego's are Everywhere in Professional Sports,"This book is somewhat entertaining and informative, if you can swallow Rick Horrow's HUGE ego and soapboxing. I don't know what's become of Rick since he wrote this book, but if he's still active in the professional sports community, it would amazing. He is so full of himself that mostly every page has some mention of all the great things he did. He chastizes and bad mouths mostly everyone he has ever worked with...the only exception that comes to mind is Bud Selig. Overall, Rick tells some interesting behind-the-scenes stories and explains in a vivid way the power playing that goes on with the rich egomaniacs in the world of professional sports, but if you're like me, after reading through the fluff and overdramatized exploits with Rick's so-called partners, you won't be able to finish this book. I couldn't."
3,Well written but eclectic coverage,"This is a wonderfully written book, as many reviewers have said. The author has a gift for clear explanation and writes in a lucid style which is far too rare in IT books.But beware! The coverage of topics is quite uneven: be sure that it covers the material that you need.For example, the coverage of mail is a little on how SMTP, POP and IMAP work, and 17 pages covering configuration of exim and a little on sendmail, and combatting spam, It doesn't give enough detail to begin to set up or maintain a mail server. Contrast this with 40 pages on the Linux File System standard."
2,Dealers of Lightning,"Hiltzik seems more interested in the celebrity of the PARC players and the ""gee whiz"" aspects of their inventions than in the tougher questions about what makes innovation work inside large corporations. Fumbling the Future, in contrast, takes on the far more interesting and important issues - and does a better job of addressing them. So good in fact that, when Hiltzik finally gets to issue, he does so by asking, ""Did Xerox fumble the future?"". By the way, I've noticed that Fumbling has just been republished....nice to see."
1,STRICTLY A CUT AND PASTE JOB,DEVOID OF INSIGHT OR ORIGINAL THOUGHT HILTZIG CONTINES TO TAKE CREDIT FOR OTHER PEOPLES RESEARCH AND THEN STATES IN A MOST BORING NANNER.
3,You Got To Have Heart.,"Harvey Keitel stars in this film as Elvis Presley. Yes, Harvey Keitel as Elvis. Or at least the character he plays thinks he's Elvis. Now, I know that Keitel doesn't look anything like The King. However, that's part of the charm of this movie; how a man who doesn't look anything like Elvis can embody his soul and spirit so perfectly.The film has a mix of both wonderful and wooden acting performances, and the plot is decent, but not very tight. However, seeing Keitel singing ""Suspicious Minds"" dressed as The King is worth some of the other dribble you will find here. The soundtrack is great as is the footage filmed from inside Graceland.Overall, not too bad of a movie."
1,Disappointing,"I just bought this movie as it looked good and I love Harvey Keitel and Bridget Fonda. But is it just me or is the acting really, really bad? It seems like a B movie. There's nothing particularly compelling about it in any way. I'm not an Elvis fan but I don't think the writer/directors wanted to find somebody who resembled Elvis to play the part. I don't think that was the point at all. Anyway, I still haven't decided if I can watch it drone on any longer! I don't recommend this movie. If you haven't seen Freeway with Keifer Sutherland and Reese Witherspoon; rent it..it's an older one that was overlooked but it's extremely entertaining!"
4,magical,"Johnathon Schaech is handsome and seductive as an embittered and guilt-ridden widower in trouble. He encounters an aging Elvis (Keitel) with surprising powers of perception. They journey together to Graceland in a voyage of discovery and healing. Subtle, sly, sweet, and magical."
4,Very satisfied,"These earrings were meant as a small stocking stuffer for my wife at Christmas. She was surprised and very pleased when she opened them and has been wearing them ever since. When she is happy, I am happy. Many thanks for making these available and getting them shipped out to me in a timely manner!"
1,Wrong! Wrong ! Wrong!,Just recently move to Memphis 3 weeks ago from St.Louis and The Pizza he said was the best here was the absolute worst. I was so dissapointed and angry. I don't know where he got his info whether he did a survey or actually tasted himself either way the info was just plain wrong a waste of my time and money.
2,mighty Brite might disappointing,The mighty bright is poorly named. It does not shed enough light in a dark area (i.e. orchestra pit) to allow the user a chance to read the music. Overpriced and under functional.
2,more a toy than a light,"Sorry,This thing looks more like a toy than a real stand light.. I can't say it's over priced, or that I have any real remorse about my purchase, but this is not the professional solution to my music stand light problem. While very flexible, it doesn't really offer much brightness, even with three LED's."
3,Lego Accesory Baseplate,"Well, I was a little suprise by how small it is. I can tell you that I wouldn't have bought that in a store. But the kids use it so that is all that really matters. I would change the name maybe to a ""medium"" or even ""small"" baseplate."
3,"Okay, but not sturdy enough to pick up","We bought this for my daughter to build a special club project on. It serves as a nice background, but it is so thin that you can't even more the project around without the pieces popping off--it flexes too much because it is flimsy. It isn't like the smaller platforms that come in Lego sets. She needed something larger, so we attached it to a nice piece of wood to provide stablility; then, she could build her project on it. It did serve our need for a nice green background, & it wasn't expensive. Just be aware that it won't hold whatever you build on it if you are going to pick it up and move it at all."
5,Lego Plate,perfect for my daughter to go with the big box of Legos we got her for Christmas. this large building platform is just what we expected.
4,Cheaper from Lego.com,"These are always cheaper through Lego themselves, which is weird. Usually you can find products cheaper somewhere else, but these are only $4.99 directly from Lego."
1,check shipping charges,I went to order 8 of these total order $32 shipping $39 total $7110x10 in plastic plates must be 8oz its a store rip off do not buy from this storeyes i have a snapshot of the billthe plates are great if you make your table im complaning about the store
5,A good size for creativity.,"I bought this additional plate for the basic set so my grandson would have more space to ""create"" his constructions on. It's working out just fine.... he loves it."
5,Approved,"My nephew loves this ""grass"" for his Legos creations. It was also one of the most inexpensive building plates that I was able to find."
3,Small but Adequate,"Seemed a bit smaller than 10"" x 10"", but I guess it'll be ok for building one Lego project at a time."
5,Lego,With out these you can't build those amazing lego cities you see on TV or in the living room. Perfect!!!
4,Bought as a Christmas gift,Nice idea but not necessary to build anything using legos. Great for moving your project around and out of the way
3,"Great for Legos, not for the wallet","I bought this for my son to help him have a base for his multitude of Lego creations. It worked great for that. The nice thing is the size because its larger than the smaller bases. What I do not agree with is the price - $7 for nothing but a 10x10 plate??? The big box stores are now selling plastic Lego cases to hold pieces and they come with this exact base for only $11. Great product, but I don't recommend purchasing just this base because it's not worth $7 alone. Save your money for something else."
3,Different style,"If you are looking for a book with a good story and characters, this is not the book for you. If you like reading ghost stories, this is worth the read. The first story was written very well. I was disappointed in the second story for I thought it was not as concise as the first one. There seem to be many ideas left hanging. The gathering of the men (like Harry Houdini) that met to talk about these stories was also disappointing. I think that area could have been explained more. Just a different type of style from other works I have read, but not bad."
2,disappointed,"I can't even describe how disappointed I was by this book. I love Michaels' other books - I own them all, but this was a disaster. It didn't even appear to have been edited - throughout the second story, the name of one character is constantly switching between Harry and Henry, sometimes on the same page. Overall, it was not chilling or witty like her other books. The writing seemed flat, which surprised me since all of her other books are wonderful reads."
1,I couldn't believe how disappointing it was.,"As a long-time admirer of Michaels/Peters, I always greet a new work by this author with great enthusiasm. When the librarian checked it out to me, she shook her head and said, *This one is 'different'* In this case that meant it was a disappointment! I have adored every Amelia Peabody tale and I consider *Ammie, Come Home* one of the most chilling stories I have ever read. I have to agree with others that the first-time readers of Michaels shouldn't judge her talents on the basis of this book."
1,This was a big disappointment from my favorite author.,"I had planned on writing about how disappointed I was with Barbara Michaels' newst book, but all the other reviews have summed up my feelings perfectly. I hope for her sake, and for the sake of all her loyal readers, that Ms. Michaels reads these messages."
4,Get the Geist,"I had not read any of her works as either Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters before, so this was my introduction to her work. This mystery is actually two stories in one, with each story around 100-120 pages long. I preferred the first to the second; both dealt with families being tormented by a spirit of some kind or poltergeist activity. At the close of each story, the ghostly gentleman's club - including Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - draw various conclusions. Thus there is not just one right answer, but instead various opinions and scenarios. Good work, quick read, fun for classic mystery / poltergeist fans."
5,Great Book!!,this book gave a really good perspective on yellow journalism. the book also gave very good and detailed information. i reccomend this book to anyone doing any sort of research on yellow journalism
4,An extra star for 'Mansion World',"This CD is solidly enjoyable, but I feel many of the songs sound very similar to each other- slow, heavy, and accompanied by Elijah Wood's droning, eerie voice. The only song that stands out to me in stark contrast is Mansion World- what an original and beautiful song. The first time I heard it, it was like getting hit with a ton of bricks. If you're a fan of dark, electronic-based music (ala Ministry or Front Line Assembly), I'm sure you'll have a similarly pleasant experience. The whole CD is very atmospheric and haunting, two adjectives that I love in my music. Deadsy's second album is faster and somewhat heavier, and just as good if not better than 'Commencement'."
2,A major disappointment!,"While this is not quite ""as boring as watching grass grow"", the reader form Arkansas is closer to the mark than others. This latest ""techn-thriller"" from Patrick has very little ""techno"" and the ""thrills"" are somewhat lacking also. I thoroughly enjoyed both ""Nimitz Class"" and ""Kilo Class"", but this one was a major disappointment. The long sections describing Ben Adnam's ""journeys', including excrutiating detail about what he ate for Breakfast, Lunch, etc were quite boring. He is still a long way from being the next Tom Clancy. ""The Hunt for Red October"" remains the undefeated champion."
2,New Ending Please!,"What a bummer of an ending! Seriously, an absolutely riveting read for the first 300 pages, then disaster strikes! One of the most tame endings I think I have ever seen in a thriller! Please Mr. Robinson, go back and write an alternative ending! The fact that the majority of the book is brilliant only means the dissapointment is magnified by the poor ending! Read with caution. Honestly, alarm bells should ring like crazy in your head when in a 400 page thriller, you realise that the author is going to conclude it in less than 20 pages!! What happened, did his typewriter run out of ink?"
2,Saving Grace,"This book is about Grace, an elderly woman who sits on the porch of her home every year on the night of the Splendor Bell Gala in New Bethany. Due to rumors and gossip the residents of the town thinks she is nothing more than a batty old lady. Four friends - Rose, Naomi, Gayle and Lucy decide to reach out and help Grace and as they do their friendship strengthens.I was instantly drawn to this book. The story description had me thinking it would be an excellent read. I was disappointed. It was not as good as what I had built up in my mind. It is book 2 of a series and maybe if I had read book one I would of been more connected to the characters and it would of made a difference. To me it was boring, it was a struggle to keep my attention on the story. The last two chapters did pick up interest a little, but overall I just didn't care for it.**I received this book as an ebook from Multnomah Waterbrook Publishers in exchange for my honest review."
1,Blair Witch Project meets Dawn of the Dead meets Cloverfield meets I don't give a %#&*,"O.K. I likes me a scary, entertaining flick, but this one was hardly that. There was nothing original except the infected firefighter that was trying to put a somewhat solid foot forward! (Hence, the one star for that makeup effect) Otherwise, the handheld pseudo-documentary feel was just plain annoying (believe me, I tried watching it again, but just fast-forwarded through scenes, again and again and again...).What a waste of Jennifer Carpenter's talent....don't buy it, rent it with very low expectations.P.S.---When I wrote the above review I didn't know it was a remake of ""REC""...still doesn't change my opinion of this annoyingly bad film!"
1,What a pathetic joke,"I miss the good old fright movies.This movie is just pathetic.i sat through the whole thing, gore and all. only to be given the most stupid ending.i can not understand why film makers suddenly decide, ""oh yeah, i need to end this movie."" so the film maker just does some kind of stupid unrelated ending.the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it did have ENGLISH closed captions for the hearing impaired but other wise do not waste your time or money on this movie, it just is stupid."
3,Predictable,"I figured out the ""virus"" early on when they mentioned the dog was sick. This movie was kind of a rip off on the ""Blair Witch"" (we can't see what's going on, just scream a lot and people will be freaked out) concept.I do have to say the film is worth watching just for the Zombie death camera scene - I didn't see that coming and it was awesome."
2,"Rabies, what a waste of time.....","I rarely review anything that I do not like!I hated ""Quarantine""!The preview looked good, Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) & Jay Hernandez (World Trade Center) are both quality actors.The movie is shaky cameras, alot of screaming, bad, bad acting by most everyone except for Carpenter & Hernandez.The preview and front cover of ""Quarantine"" show a screaming Jennifer Carpenter, that's the end of the movie, yes, I'm serious, thats the final scene before the credits roll! How lame is a movie, if they need the final shot on the cover and in the previews??If the entire movie was anything like the last two minutes of the movie, it may have done well!All I can do is try to warn you, don't waste your time!"
1,Worst movie EVER,This movie was the most predicable and disappointing ever created. I'd rather watch paint dry!
3,Pass the toilet paper please ... ; ),This movie spent 45 minutes leading to insipid horror.The best part was watching the cast get killed.One would think that the primary purpose in life is survival; too bad the movie didn't get killed off.
5,Quarantine Review,This movie is a great movie and left me in suspense. I loved this movie so much that I saw the second.
1,I tried to be scared,"I love movies with this premise. But there are some fundamental things that the directors and writers really should've known when making this movie. If there was a deadly plague or a dangerous virus...why in the world would you go door to door asking people to come OUT of their apartments? The first thing a logical person would do is tell everyone to stay in their apartments and away from others. In addition to this, it takes FOREVER for authorities to arrive, another unbelievable. There were just too many things in this movie that makes it just seem contrived, and hence, not scary."
3,Very Creepy!!!,"I thought this was a really good scary movie! A reporter named Angela Vidal is doing a report on the night shift at a Fire Station. (That's pretty cool because my dad was a fireman!) Things pick up when they respond to a medical emergency at an apartment complex. They try to help a woman, but she tries to bite them. Soon, the military lock all the doors and take away the electricity. Throughout the night, the people trapped in the complex figure out what's happening, deal with the zombies, and find a way out. I love that the whole movie takes place in one night. If you love horror, and zombies, you'll love QUARANTINE!!!P.S. In our theatre, they're were little children, and when the movie was over, a little girl said to her dad; ""Don't ever take me to a movie like that again!"" And later, out in the lobby, I saw her crying. What's wrong with parents today?"
5,"...entire mad clan end up on the run.,..","This is another great book from Mason, who always manages to repackage boy meets girl palatably & deliver a fresh take on the usual.Following on from the book ""Playing James"", which starred Holly, Clem is the wayward younger sister.When she is fired from her job due to the duplistic dealings of her former colleague & boyfriend, Clem retreats to the family house to lick her wounds.Unfortunately big sister Holly hunts her down, and manages to bully her into some rather unsavory doings involving break and enters, all in an attempt to get a scoop on a society girl from Hollys newspaper who has gone missing just before her wedding.As Clem finds a fresh love interest where she never expected to look, the entire mad clan end up on the run over in France where all sorts of interesting things happen.Great entertaining book, and there hasn't been a book by Sophie Mason yet which I've not enjoyed."
1,Equipment2u rip off,I was never informed how much the shipping would be. I guess I'm too used to Amazon's great service and didn't notice (my fault) the alternate seller. I was charged 60 dollars shipping for a 79 dollar item. My fault but lesson learned.
4,"All the basics, minus one!","This is a wonderful book of basic business start-up info. The only thing missing was a section or chapter on how to effectively distinguish yourself and your business from the growing community of entrepreneurs. I combined the info in ""dummies"" with Marion Gold's ""Personal Publicity Planner: How to Market YOU."" Now that's a winning combination for small business owners with few dollars to spend on advertising and promotion."
3,insightful yet cynnical,"I was sorely disappointed in this book. Although it did offer some insightful tips and basic business background it failed to offer any appreciation for the small business entrepeneur. The authors lacked a human element and wasted time discouraging the reader with every possible pitfall and disadvantage to starting a business. Reality is welcome, absolutely, dry cynnicism should be left elsewhere."
1,Frightfully bad,"...I had a pair that I bought out of desperation(a quick fix) once and consider them to be the worst of the many different ear buds I've gone through throughout the years. Tinny, with very little range or bass I refused to use them after one time.The absolute worst. If you ever think about buying these elsewhere don't bother. They are ...not worth the material they are made of. They are reallly bad."
3,Just OK for meditation,"I bought this CD because of the Out Of Body Experience and Astral Projection tracks. However, these were not better than other tracks for helping me with Astral Projections.Now this is not a bad CD. It has good background music that you can use at work. However, the tracks are at best 5 minutes long and not really suited to be used in a loop, so have that in mind."
1,China Marine by Jesse Bedwell,In my opinion the worst book ever written. The sentences are disjointed and hard to understand. The author constantly repeats the same facts over and over and then he later contradicts what he had previously said! I have an extensive library of books about the Marine Corps. This will not be added to the collection.
3,I actually give it 3 and a half stars...,"Well, I first saw the movie not knowing that there was a book. I really liked the movie. The book has some of the same characters but it's mostly a different storyline then the movie. All and All I liked the movie better. *BUT* the book WAS good yet a little confusing at times. I was happy with the ending."
5,I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,"This book was absolutely phenomenal. Many books have great stories. Many books are well written. But Joanne Greenberg has written a wonderful story in a beautiful, poetic, thought-provoking way that not many can. The story leaves you hopeful, though not because the world is made out to be perfect, but because it is made to seem so real."
2,Low quality,This tripod is not very adjustable. The legs slide out but there is no way to keep them in place. The only locking feature if the twist to tighten piece for the head. Your much better off dropping a little extra cash on a mini with locking legs.
3,Side snaps not acceptable,"While the sharpener seems to live up to its original intent, the side snaps designed to hold the unit closed when not in use are cheap and detach easily. One of mine came apart when I first opened the sharpener."
1,Broken in 30 Seconds,I slide a knife through the Ozitech fewer than 10 times before it was completely useless. The diamond coating peeled off most of the curved metal fingers almost instantly. This thing was worthless!
4,Great for already sharp knives,"This sharpener is great for maintaining sharp knives, but I have been disappointed in its effect on my older knives. They improved some, but not to a honed edge. Perhaps I was expecting too much. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Furi Diamond Fingers,"I bought 2 one for a Christmas gift for my son and one for myself. I have tried it on several different knives, hunting and pocket type, I still can not get an edge that will slice a piece of paper with one stroke or shave the hair on my arm. I have taken one knife through probably 200 times."
5,Finally,I love my sharpener. I have had everykind of sharpeners in the past and this one is exceptional! It is easy to use and gives a fantastic edge.
5,Ozitech Diamond finger knife sharpener,I can not sharpen anything. I dull everything. This sharpener is a god send!
5,Good knives deserve great sharpeners!,"My kitchen drawer was strewn with various knife sharpeners until I purchased my Furi Ozitech. I threw all of them away, including the electric one because I am so happy with this one. I can really tell the difference in my knives now. I don't like the sound of steel rubbing against steel that is created, but you get that with any of them. I bought one for my daughter too who said, ""Mom thank you! You make everything better!"""
2,"STILL looking for a non-electric, well-made, not-too-expensive knife sharpener","09.11.1I'm SO DISAPPOINTED; been using the Furi Ozitech Diamond Fingers Pro Knife Sharpener since August. I really like Rachael Ray, and I really wanted to like this knife sharpener, too, but the bottom line is:IT DOESN'T GET MY KNIVES VERY SHARP.I used to use rolling knife-sharpeners (can't find any more the quality ones I used to buy), and they got the blades of all my knives really sharp - ""tomato sharp"" is what I want. While this Furi DOES get my Wüsthof Classic 4582 Cook's knife somewhat better-than-dull (to be fair), still it feels a bit awkward to use, doesn't work well at all on my paring and smaller knives, and what sharp edge I do get doesn't last very long.BUMMER -- I'm still looking."
1,worst ever,I bought 2 of these and they are the worst sharpener I ever owned never got it sharp enough to slice paper and most of the diamond grit come off the fingers and just left a big mess of dust I would never ever buy this again or recommend it to anyone!!!!
3,Furi FUR626 Ozitech Diamond Fingers Pro Knife Sharpener,"What can you say about an item like this Furi FUR626 Ozitech Diamond Fingers Pro Knife Sharpener, it works enough, though it feels as if it isn't being properly guided thru the sharpener."
3,"Is cheap, works like it","Tired of dull knives in the house and having been through no less than five other gadgets to sharpen them, I decided to give the Furi Ozitech a try.On first use, I was underwhelmed by it's performance. The knives I set out to sharpen were probably too dull for this thing, so it might not have been precisely fair to judge it too harshly. Not willing to quit, I kept returning to the Furi in a zealous attempt to emulate the success others say they acheived with the thing. So, grinding away at it with my tired old knives (and evoking that GAHD awful screeching sound this thing makes), I finally had some success with a noticeably sharper knife on my fourth try. This success was further enhanced by steel-honing the knife after the shapening process.In sum, this thing works IF you posess the right level of tenacity, and then, not in exactly spectacular fashion."
5,Awesome,This thing is awesome! The best and last sharpener you will ever need. It automatically adjusts to your knife!
2,Knife Sharpener,"This sharpener puts a very sharp edge on your knife, and at first I was very pleased with it. It is small and easy to use. Unfortunately after a while I noticed that my knives were not as sharp as they used to be, and I think the reason is that the sharpener removes too much metal and eventually ruins your knife.I have since bought a professional level sharpener at a much higher cost, and was able to get my knife edges back."
4,BeautifulBrazilianmusic,"It's everything the editorial review says it is - wonderful musicality - samba-jazz/bossa/hip-hop/pop - very distinctively Brazilian. Highly recommend. Could have been five stars except for track 3 (a bit of silliness - mercifully short, 35 sec.) and the production quality isn't as 'clear' as it could be, but don't let that put you off ..... superb"
5,La Vie des Maitres,"..pour ceux qui parlent franais....J ai lu la première fois ce livre en 1971. Une édition avec photographies. Quel découverte pour un jeune homme de 21 ans ! ....Ce livre m a inspiré depuis ce temps. A tous les jours le matin je lis un passage au hasard ou une phrase favorite, et a toutes les fois j y trouve une joie profonde qui me guide tout le long de la journée. Je conseille ce livre à tous ceux qui veulent découvrir leur vrai nature spirituel. Écris dans une forme simple et avec des mots de tous les jours. La Vérité toute simple, toute pure s en dégage...En faite on ne fais pas que lire ce livre..on le vis ...."
5,Love these shoes!,"These shoes are great. I love naturalizers because they are the most comfortable shoes, especially for heels. I highly recommend naturalizers!"
4,Great!,"Book arrived as promised, practically new with only slight evidence of previous use. Very pleased with this item!"
2,I was disapointed,"I bought this book because I read where Poliquin suggested it. Nothing new in the workouts. Dave definately likes to write. I was hoping for inspiration and motivation. I got supersets and 4 calories can be found in a gram of protein. Nothing new here. Some good pictures, but not worh the dough. Recomend Dinosaur Training by Brooks Kubik or maybe something by Tudor Bompa."
5,BISS,Dave Draper can make anything great to read. He has a prowess that I've never encountered when reading about fitness .BISS is a must have for anyone looking to get back into lifting or start lifting. Do yourself a favor and buy this book you will not regret it .
3,Witty World War II spy thriller that pleases,"I actually give this film 3 1/2 stars. Fine direction by Billy Wilder and a witty script make this a most entertaining World War II spy film. Fine performances from Franchot Tone,Anne Baxter et al, and a marvelous one from Erich von Stroheim as a strutting, arrogant Rommel. Classic line: Rommel: ""We'll take that fat cigar out of his (Churchill's) mouth and make him say HEIL""."
5,The Vision,"Required reading for the hungry soul, consious mind, or curious being.Visionseeker is chalked full of mystic experiences, healing practices and advice of extraordinary importance. Hank's insight of our wordly concerns [political, economical, religious, and environmental]offers options and hope for the future of humanity."
5,It's a Denso!!! OEM item.,"This is a bargain compared to dealer pricing. Plus, a simple trip to the local parts store to rent the tool and I've fixed my own vehicle! Turns out the old oxygen sensor had Denso on it. SO, I've replaced the part with a factory part and a fraction of the cost. Now, my CEL is gone and my vehicle is running top notch once again."
2,3D not ready for TV,"3D technology has just not grown to the point where it can be enjoyed on a home TV screen. However, that is not the fault of the seller. The film arrived in a timely manner and in New condition. Sorry for the late submission of feedback."
1,These don't provide any warmth & don't stay put,"Bought these at my local Pharmacy for some shoulder pain.It didn't not feel like it ever heated up, like a normal Ben Gay application. The patch also does not stay stuck in place, and feels overly moist and loose. If you try to put a T-shirt on, it will get stuck on the shirt, and simply fall loose. These are not good at all, I would not recommend at all. A better solution might be Freeze-IT roll on tube, to avoid the mess, and get more heat."
1,Can you say COLD!,I bought these patches at the local drug store for a muscle strain. It never warmed. I did read the instructions and understand that the patch should be cool to start but is then supposed to warm. The heat therapy is what I was after. A hour later the patch was still cold and I took it off. If I had wanted an ice pack I would have used one. Don't waste your money.
3,Not my favorite,"I usually love books by Madeleiine Wickham, but this was not my favorite. I did read the entire book because I was hoping for any kind of positivity. This book was rather depressing and not very positive about life. Would not read it again."
2,"This thing ""burns""! It's too ""hot""!","I bought this 12"" powerbook from Amazon a month ago and do like its look. But I need to let everyone know this machine has severe HEAT problem. I bet that's why the problem has gone down [$$$] recently. The Apple support claims they have never heard something like this and insist me to bring it back to AppleStore. If you go to google and do a search on ""apple powerbook 12"" heat problem"" and you will find all kinds of discussion on this. It looks good...BUT..please don't buy it unless you are going to use some kickboxing wrist PADs or wear two layered JEANS. I hope no one has to suffer like I do. Cannot even get rid of it on eBay since the problem is so well known now. Steve Jobs said it's hottest! I TOTALLY agree this is ""the"" ""hottest"" powerbook ever. I previously used IBM, Dell, SONY, Asus and Toshiba notebook....I guess I can fairly claim the problem in a way ;-) Good luck to you new Apple users."
4,Great Sound,This does not fit Ext Cab 6.5' Bed Trucks! Had to bring it in and professionally Installed. Better off at an Exhaust shop all together!
4,prepareing for a Yellowstone adventure,I'm going to be in Yellowstone for 7 months working but every chance I get I want to see as much as possible. This book on hikeing trails will help me find the ones that I will be able to do.
4,not enough Teton,"First of all, this is a GREAT book.I just want other readers to know that 3/4's of this book, if not more, is on Yellowstone hikes. I would have loved more hikes on Tetons - at least half and half...which is what I was expecting when buying this book."
2,Overpriced shipping,"When I went to add a pair of these to my cart (one for mouse one for keyboard), it came up with a shipping charge of just over $15. I went to another online retailer and ordered a pair of 6ft ps/2 cables PLUS shipping for less than these guys want for shipping alone."
3,tropical fruit,"I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue"
4,A good read,"This book has enough mystery and drama to keep you reading. The hero has an interesting and likable character. There are enough other ""players"" to make a good story, but not too many to make you wonder ""what is there role here""."
3,Not very plausible,"This is my third Dunbar e-book and the least plausible. Without giving up the crucial 'scientific' clue, let's just state that the science of it is not within realm of plausibility. It reminds me of one of the late Crichton's book dealing, if I remember correctly, with shifting the rotational axis of our planet.Never mind Crichton - McClure is perfectly capable of following the newest real medical science, read his Dust to Dust. In this case that follows somewhat similar line of UK/Scottish governments sacrificing common people in the 'national interest', his apparently rabid rats are more in the realm of fantasy than science.Kind of makes the genre not that attractive to this reader."
1,not what i expected,"I paid $70 for a used $8.95 paperback! I thought is was a hard cover collectors edition. However, I was able to return to sender."
3,1400 Rower is pretty good,"I've had this rower for almost a year now and it has held up well. There were a few issues locking down the resistance fan housing on the front of the rower. It took some effort and force but I finally got it secured.The idea that resistance is generated by increasing the speed of the rowing motion is sound, but it does reach a point of diminishing returns. You are going to go anaerobic (or catatonic) trying to get enough true resistance by speeding your stroke pace.It's not great but it is a good introduction to rowing. It was good enough to get me hooked on rowing as an addition to my aerobic home gym stockpile (along with the Treadclimber, Airdyne Bike, and ellipticals). But, I will be finding a new rowing machine that will allow me to set a static resistance instead of the dynamic air driven kind."
4,Heart warming Gospel greats,"This CD of Goerge Jones 20 GOSPEL GREATS has been very inspiring to millions over the world, infact all the songs made it big time in the gospel world.George has bless the hearts of many with this album and he will continue to do so to all his fans and to those who has yet to hear these heart warming gospel greats. This is why i need this CD in my collection."
3,Has good and bad features,"I bought this item quite awhile ago so I could resume needlework (cross stitch) after 20 years and a huge difference in my eyesight.It's great to have 3 choices of magnification lenses, however it's hard to see through the swirls. The attached light does little good to illuminate the project, I have to use another ott light right next to me, and wish they still made hi intensity lights (or bulbs) I don't know if the light would be good for reading in bed. I do know that the weight of the 4 AA batteries makes the unit very heavy and after awhile the neck cord cuts into the back of your neck. I tried to take the batteries out but then the unit is too light and falls over due to the weight of the lens attached. The new imporved version with led lights might be better illumination, but I'm guessing it's still heavy and hard to see thru the lenses. I'm back on amazon looking for other magnifier/light options and thought I'd write this review."
4,Another Peter Ustinov goodie.,"I'm an Agatha Christie fan. I like her novels and I like this movie. This is another Peter Ustinov signature role Hercule Poirot solves another crime with his ""little gray cells."""
4,Insight into the Minds Behind Modern Dance,"Like most of the new artistic modes at the beginning of the twentieth century, modern dance took the established norms prevalent at the time and broke them into pieces. Yet over the years, modern dance itself became fragmented and could not be recognized as the unified form of balletic opposition it had once been. Not only did modern dance change, but people's ideas about what modern was also changed. This book consists of seven different third generation modern dance choreographers describing their seven different beliefs of what modern dance really is. From Anna Sokolow's ideas of rebellion to Alwin Nikolais' ideas of abstraction, these written testaments to the lives of the some of the most innovative and important choreographers of the century allow us to see what lies behind dance and to gain insight into what modern dance was, is, and can be."
3,"Interesting, but Boring!","I found this book very interesting, but because it is a case study of many couples the content is quite dry and boring."
4,Hammock Review,"This is a great product am really enjoying relaxing and reading and using the hammock I purchased in Nicaragua. It was easy to put together, but the only drawback I feel is that you can't swing a lot, but I am over that!"
2,This product's chief virtue is to offer a lesson in the school of hard knocks,".for those who fall for it. Look under ""Bricks & More Building Plates"" and you will find (as of this writing) the very same 15 x 15-inch base plate (""Building Plate"" in LEGO terminology), with the very same item no. (628), with no indicated differences, and about $2.60 cheaper.As always, it pays to shop around. Maybe even comparison-shop within this one vendor, when they get sloppy at times like this."
2,Unused...,"Well, it seemed a no brainer to have a base for the Lego bricks my son got along with this item for Christmas. Unfortunately, this piece of plastic has been overlooked and unused since it was opened and has proved unessential for my children's enjoyment of Legos. To it's credit, it has held up after being stepped on, flung, and tossed aside in room cleaning. But I do regret spending the $15+ shipping to get it. Unless you are a die-hard lego sculptor and/or need it, skip this item. Just another thing to clean up along with the hundreds of bricks they actually play with."
2,One size does not fit all!,"We ordered these gloves for my 4 year old son but they were way too big for him. He put his hand in and the gauntlets reached to his shoulder! I would say that they were a size Small in the adult size.Also, they are made of a thin material. So if they did fit my son, then he would most likely wear them out fast. I don't believe that they would survive many washings or dryings, especially with bleach."
1,Not for kids,"These gloves are for adults. Unless you're going to dress up as Buzz Lightyear for Halloween this year, they'll go in the trash. The gloves are the size of my 5 year olds arm."
3,Good read.,"Once upon a time, Cade was an undercover agent infiltrating a werewolf cult who had a brief passion with Savannah, one of the women kept by the cult's leader. Now, they must team up again to find out who is trying to avenge the cult leader's death. As they work together, they find that what they once had is still alive, but romance will have to take a backseat to solving the case and surviving it.*** If you haven't read the prior book, ""Beneath A Rising Moon"", there is a good chance you're going to be lost, but not hopelessly so. Aside from the paranormal element, this is a basically realistic book about obsession, religion gone wrong, and the butterfly effects of one's actions. ***Amanda Killgore"
3,Pretty good,This is a good read. A lot of twists and turns. As you read the plot thickens. Keri is a great writer.
5,Most Excellent Blues Book,Kenny Sultan is one of my favorite guitar players he is the one who taught me about fingerstyle blues. when I was 18 I told my mom I wanted to learn how to play the blues so she went to a guitar shop and the sales person told her she should buy me this when I got the book I was a little overwhelmed (cause I wasnt expecting to learn how to play with my fingers... obviously I didnt know much about the blues then) and really excited cause what ever kenny was playin on the tape souned awsome any ways if you want to learn fingerstyle blues buy this I have to say this essential stuff
2,reviewing a view of Christian Liagre,"Christian Liagre is an artist beyond the usual confines of space filling. He always considers the architecture and site before anything else. And even though his work is immediately recognizable, he never repeats himself- there is nothing formulaic.Nothing ever screams money. The finishes, the light, the mix are always beautiful and comfortable.So while I got the book hoping to see a substansial review of his work, I was dissappointed in the chopiness and lack of ability to ""see"" the house and rooms shown. The designers work saves the book, because it is so complex and interesting. Poor choices in views and cutting off of vistas and lack of detail make the book fail."
3,"It surely isn't ""step by step""...","First thing that I find irritating is that the only song fully transcribed is ""Portrait of Tracy"", but this can be forgived since the aim of the book is to get the techniques Jaco used. But then, on ""Portrait of Tracy"" there is just transcription (accurate, though) but there is no in-depth approach to techniques which are VERY hard to apply.If you want to continue studying Jaco stuff, I recommend this book to start with and later get something that's more into transcriptions"
3,was okay,I was expecting something else. I wanted he real story not the one they have in the bible now. Still was a good one time watch.I was good to show in our Humanities class for a debate.
5,A Favorite in My Household,"My sons are avid builders of Lego garages, so both the curved and the straight road boards were met with great enthusiasm. Not only do they build their garages on them, but they ""drive"" their Matchbox cars into their creations."
3,Interesting But Not Eberhart's Best.,"I have read most of Mignon Eberhart's books and found them, can't put down mysteries but this one, Postmark Murder was somewhat unsatisfying.The background is rather confusing. A wealthy businessman has died andhis will states that his brother, still in Poland is to get the bulk of his wealth. The brother cannot be found but a child appears who it isassumed is the brother's child, found in an orphanage in Poland. She is brought to America to live with friends of the businessman until theycan find her father. In this book Eberhart agonizingly goes over the same clues until you are tempted to go to the end of the book to find out""who done it"". If you are not familiar with her books, I would definitely start with, ""The Yellow Room) and ,""The Bat"", real chillers."
3,no pop culture in here,"A good album, but not the true thing. If you like classical music, and are a Beatles fan.. you might enjoy this ""classical"" rendition."
3,"mighty mini driver with lots of heart, but not enough power","After years of using the standard stick type of power screwdriver, I was looking forward to this ""new to me"" configuration. It looked at what proffessed to be everything I was looking for; especially the new lithium power source which is sure to eliminate the need for a last minute charge, just when you need the screwdriver.It came nicely packaged in a colorful tin that will be collecting screws and nails before long and a packaged set of bits. Unfortunately there is no way to keep the bits with the screwdriver, so it's another thing to find space for in your pocket.To the biggest problem; this thing has no torque. If the screw you are trying to install or remove meets any resistance- you are done, go find another screwdriver. This is particularlly anoying since the Skil 2336 looks like for all the world, to be a powerhouse.I suggest you pay a little more and buy one that can get the job done."
2,Agent Cody Banks/Agent cody Banks 2,"Very happy with S&H. The Shipping was EXTREMELY fast!!!! But, this movie didn't come in the original DVD case (as pictured) and no where (that I see) does it tell you this. It came in just in a clear plastic cd case and the back of the dvd has a LOT of scratches!! Have not played it yet, but IT was not what I was expecting!! Depending on how it plays I may give more stars or take away one..."
3,Test of the ECM HST 1 recording my piano at home,"I used the microphone to record my piano at home. To be honest, the difference between ""with"" or ""without"" the device is not huge. Probably for other purposes it could be more notorious. If I could tested the microphone before buying it, probably I would have thought it a little more. In my case, it is not worth for the money (USD 80 plus shipping and tax).Fernando (Santiago, Chile)."
2,Not really all that funny,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, but apparently he'd never seen the whole movie, just a couple of humorous parts. ""Eating Raoul"" is a much funnier cannibal movie!"
4,Excellent battery! Beautiful Pics!,"Great battery life- It is recharging (only down side is you must take it out of the camera and reset the time and date when you reinsert it to the camera). I have charged it only twice in 2 months- and I take TONS of pictures!It's 10 MP, and the picture quality is wonderful. no graininess.Anti-shake- it's only OK, not as great as my former camera. But, the battery life more than makes up for it.Plus, it takes an SD card, which is easier to find, and I got a 4 GB one, so I take videos, which turn out AMAZINGly!! (good mic pick up, good pic quality)Hope this helps you."
5,Excellent camera!!! Highly recommended,"I own this camera since a few months back and I cant say more than positive things about it. I love the controls the fast shooter. Pictures come out clear and sharp. What I like most is the BEST PICTURE mode or ways of selecting your setting for the pciture. Makes it so much easier than other cameras, and much more difficult for setting to get changed by mistake. I also like the way the iSO can be changed with just a few clicks....Highly recommended product!"
1,Mine was terrible,"I wanted to upgrade from my Canon 2mp camera so I tried the Exilim. Maybe mine was defective because the pictures were terrible, many out of focus and the color was not very sharp. Surprisingly though it did take very good video, but the pictures weren't worth keeping."
1,nothing like the show,"I have read the first two books and it has jumped to such extremes with absolutely nothing happening. So far Elena has met Stefan, figured out who Damon is, and got turned into a Vampire in like a month. So glad the CW took this idea and ran with it because if i had read the books first i would have never watched the show."
4,Best so far,"This is the best book so far, in my opinion. Getting ready to start the next book! They are hard to put down once you start reading."
5,Now That's What I Call Music!,Absolutely wonderful! Lashell Griffin is a true singer and she delivers in grand style with this spiritual project. Well worth buying!
5,Excellent CD. One Of The Best,"Who would imagine a housewife with a vocie of gold. I love this CD. It's one of the best CD's to come out so far this year. This lady has a power house voice that hits you inside. The song ""FREE"" is a power-house song. I also like ""Get Away"". The whole album is great. If you are a person who understands real music and appreciates talent, then there is know way you can pass up this CD. I hope she becomes the next Powerhouse singer, because i'm tired of waiting for Whitney to get here Sh_t together and Aretha is Semi retired. We need LaShell. NOW!."
5,LaShell has given us all a gift!!!,"When I saw LaShell Griffin win Oprah's Pop Star Challenge, I couldn't believe that such a beautiful voice had gone un-discovered for so long! This debut cd is a beautiful compilation of inspiration songs that will make you happy you purchased it. This stay at home mother of five definitely sings from her heart. It's the kind of cd that you can pop in the car, your computer or your home system and just be mezmerized over and over again. LaShell has the kind of voice that we have been missing and that is so rare in today's music world.My favorites are ""Free"" and ""Learn to Breathe"". Buy it! Buy two or three...and don't forget to tell a friend! You won't be disappointed!!GOD BLESS YOU LASHELL!! KEEP ON SINGING!!!!"
2,"A lot of words, not a lot of meat","There is some good info here, but there is an awful lot of unnecessary filler. Most of the recommendations are good for the general public - save money, keep it in the stock market, and forget about it - though they do need to be taken together, not as a ""cafeteria plan"". This book should really be a 30-50 page pamphlet, without all of the filler."
2,"Mediocre overall, and especially bad in parts.","While the eight recommendations were fair, none were revolutionary to someone who had already read several personal finance books. The author's tone was annoyingly casual, with repeated agitations to read his prior books. The majority of the book's pages were filled with anecdotes from the author's personal finance clients, 'in their own words', which were repetitive, frequently off-topic, and unnecessary."
1,Would his ideas work NOW?,"Interest rates on mortgages are low, but so are returns in the stock market. Schemes like Ric's work sometimes but don't give the security most people want."
4,Wealth Building demystified,This books gives lots of practical ideas for the average person to build wealth and keeping it. Very easy reading. Love his book. At the end of each chapter the author includes testimonials from his clients which personalize his advice.
4,Worth a look,"Always looking for new ways to increase my finances, I ran across this book. Full of great tips and new ideas, I decided that even I could undertake a few of the suggestions like saving change. Two months later, I had almost $200 just in excess metal. Although the book can be a bit tedious at times, it is still a collection of fresh, proven approaches to increasing your worth."
4,The Edge of Never,"Really intense story, great skiing, amazing scenery. The cinematography is really beautiful and the story told is heart warming and a good moral example of reaching for your dreams."
5,music which is off the wall but brilliant!,"Ground produces a sound almost unlike any other. The words, crazy but real. The rhythm is great! I love the drums. I've only recently discovered Ground, but I've found once you start listening to them, it's hard to stop! The louder, the better!! I want to wish them luck in Texas, They have my vote, all the way."
3,Not the best Stuart Woods but entertaining,"For those of us who have become Stone Barrington fans you won't be disappointed. Stone is up to his usual tricks. He gets any girl he wants, spends lots of money, keeps you in suspense for a while but of course, solves the crime. The ending was very weak and I did wonder how Arrington's baby went from being a girl in the end of ""Swimming to Catalina"" to a boy in the beginning of this one. It is by far not the best Stuart Woods book I've read but I found it to be an enjoyable quick read."
1,Murder-lite,"I can't believe anyone thinks this is good writing. By page 58 I couldn't care less who was killing whom or why. ""Stone"" has all the depth of Barney Fife. The banter was NOT witty. The characters were cardboard. Everyone had a den or studio where they sipped their hooch and every female within spitting distance was murdered. Come on already? Bad bad bad.... boring boring boring... For those of us who like our thrillers, ummm thrilling, this was about as much of a page turner as ""See Spot Run"". My first and last Stuart Woods booklet."
2,Bad Plot; Predictable Outcome,Story is getting a little long in the tooth. I really can't tell if this is the book I'm reading or was this the last one I read. Very predictable! Author must do better to sell me anymore books.
2,stuart is slipping,"I was disappointed by the storyline and lack of attention to detail in this book. The characters in this book, including Stone, were a bit over the top and detracts from the story. In addition to the confusion over the sex of Arrington's child, Bill Eggers, Stone's law partner is referred to as Bob on at least two occasions. ""New York Dead"" and ""Palindrome"" are his best works in my opinion."
1,Disappointing...My Worst Fears Were Realized,"What has happened to Stuart Woods? The master of the mystery thriller has taken a real vacation in Worst Fears Realized. The story begins with a pretty compelling scene and what looks to be a good thriller in the making. Unfortunately, that's it...it's downhill from that point on. Stone Barrington, the sexy, smart, ex-cop/lawyer has become a cartoon character, totally inane and unbelievable. It's sad to think that this is the same great character from New York Dead. But worse yet, the story is silly and implausable and has absolutely no merit. Don't waste your time on this one. There are too many good novels out there to read."
3,Worst Fears Realized!,"I like the main character, Stone Barrington. This author, Stuart Woods is a new read for me. My second centering around the Stone Barrington series."
3,I really wanted to like this 100%,"I love this genre. Simon R Green, Jim Butcher, Charlein Harris, Kim Harrison are my favorite authors and I wanted to add Jeanne C Stein to the list but, unfortunately, The Becoming really is just a sad commentary on the above listed authors.Maybe her second book in the series will be better BUT I doubt it. I read the book summary and it really sounds like regurgitated fodder.Sex for sex sake - she must have read too many Anita Blake stories! Thumbs down for this one."
3,"Book OK, certainly not a riveting Vampire series.","At the beginning of the book, the heroine is raped and bitten by a vampire. Never does the book indicate that she has gone through any trauma from the rape and she seems to passively accept that she has become a vampire. None of the characters are as well developed as they could be. Tanya Huff, L K Hamilton and Charlaine Harris all write a better Vampire series. I do not know if I will read the 2nd book in the series or not."
4,What a debut!,"Fast, fresh, furious fun! Not your typical vampire by a long, er, bite. Hip and now. Can't wait for the sequel."
3,Who Knows Where the Credit Goes?,"In fairness, it must be pointed out that the credit for track 4, ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes,"" is entirely incorrect. This song was first recorded by Sandy Denny when she was with The Strawbs, and that version remains definitive. Our judges would therefore accept Sandy Denny or The Strawbs as a correct response. Listing Fairport Convention is like saying ""Lady Madonna"" originated with Wings."
1,this stinks!,"Matthew Sweet by himself is good. ""Girlfriend"" is a classic cd. Suzanna Hoff is many years past her prime and the Bangles were...okay.This cd is bad. The versions are week and detract from the original songs. Sweet and Hoffs have no synergy. Why are they even together? They add nothing to these songs and simply sound like a wedding band doing covers.Did you see them on the talk shows (Conan, Leno). They were horrible!If Matthew Sweet doesn't lose weight, he may not be able to ever get a ""Girlfriend"".This seems like a desperate attempt to make money. A better covers cd is the Def Leopard one."
4,Deserves to be much better known,"This is probably the book on the churches under Nazism.It is a complex subject and the book needs to be read closely. The small size does not equal small content.The title is taken from a pastoral letter from the Bishop of Breslau requesting requiem masses for the fuhrer as he was the catholic head of a state in a concordat with the Vatican - unaware that Hitler had renounced his faith secretly in 1937 and had died a suicide.Both Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches are covered. This is a rather academic book, but it is extremely helpful when read in tandem with other books on the subject.The Nazi leadership's hostility to Christianity, yet its need to keep this veiled from the public and the difficulties faced by the churches in finding an appropriate response to Hitlerism are intelligently probed.The book is the product of a deep knowledge of the German churches."
4,A good starting point,"This book is a good starting point, but you definately also need the 3 other books of this series."
3,Handy planing and progress tool,Good overview. Should include cumlative elevation gain to justify the price. Map references do not relate to industry maps and require reseach to cross reference.
2,Frustrated !,"I'm not able to judge this book fairly as I got only 1/3 of the way through. M/s Cooper assumes that everyone has read the preceeding book and is therefore aware of all the characters and their names. Unlike other authors who write each book as a separate entity, she alludes to people, names and situations which one would have to had read to know what she is on about.I gave up after battling for some time as ones reading life is too short !"
3,Return to Firetop Mountain,"A fascinating book in which you are the hero! This choose your own adventure offers a wide selection of options from which to choose, and varied and imaginative monsters to battle. I personally feel that this book is an extremly fun filled and action packed story, with amillion different endings, but only in one can you emerge victorious, and be the champion of firetop mountain."
3,Pre-wetted?,"These sponges are cute, but they came already DAMP inside the cellophane package. I washed them before use, just in case. Has anyone else had that experience? Its a little gross, actually.Quick update on my purchase...Someone pointed out to me that these come prewetted so that they don't shrink during shipping. Makes sense to me, after all. Great product!"
3,Probably won't buy again,"It gets 3 stars for price. However, these mildew or go bad really fast. I used it twice, rung it out and sit on the ledge of my sink. And that's all it took before it smelled bad. Don't know why or what I did wrong, I use sponges every day so I didn't do anything different than what I do with the 3M sponges. I'm not going to get these again.I do like that I can get a lot for a decent price, although I'm going through them faster. The sponge itself is decent in that it does the job of course, scratchy side is easy on surfaces. It's just not worth it in the long run."
5,little tikes cinnamon and spice kitchen,My daughter is 1 and she loves it would be nice to come with a little more food but overall it's great and my 8 year old son thinks so to a great starter kitchen..........
3,"Dated, Out of Print with Its Uses","Seems was directed towards jr. high, high school and community college audiences - would be useful for writing brief school reports on Arizona.When looking about the net, online and in bookstores for info about Arizona I couldn't find anything that seemed comparable. There is useful info; necessary to take with a grain of salt as statistics are dated. If I want more info about the fine state of Arizona I believe I'll need to go to Arizona sources."
4,"Good toy, hasn't broken yet and it's fun!",This toy has been fun for the kids. We have played with it about 10 times and it still works great. You can turn the water on low so it doesn't spray everywhere and the kids can grab on of the water sprayers and squirt each other or fill up buckets.
2,Wigglin' Water Sprinkler,"I bought this for my kids thinking it would be a blast for them and the dog to run through. Except that you have to turn the water on full blast to get the little wiggles to wiggle, and by then the water goes everywhere. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the ""feet"" don't stay put on the hose at all."
4,Good Transition Book for the Series,"Ive just finished reading Ashleigh's Dream for like the 3rd time and liked it more than ever! I though Cambell did an excellent job bringing in Samantha and the book was a very good transition in the series between Ashleigh and Samantha. Also, in the third time I've read this book I realized the connection between Ashleigh's Dream and Battlecry Forever. Good Job, Joanna! It puts an interesting twist to the story. Even though the current TB books are getting kinda bad, I'd reccomend this book to any fan of the series who misses the originality of the first books. I also reccomend this book to any horse lover or horse series lover. Ashleigh's Dream happened to be the first book I read in the Thoroghbred series and was the book that urged me to continue reading the series. Also, TB fans, don't lose hope. The new writers I'm sure are trying hard to satisfy everyone's wants for the series and thats why the new books are so sparratic and confusing."
4,Just great!,"I just finish this book and I loved it! And all the other Thoroughbred books too! The autor brings Samantha in good but the endend I think was rushed. I liked how the book had a mixure of racing and training, foals etc. and it also showed that not every horse is a Triple Crown Champion that Ashleigh helps raise and train. I found that in the next book #6 that I'm now reading is that they skipped most of Fleet Goddesses race years and went on to Wonder's Pride's training, I really like Fleet Goddess and her races :( I rate this book 4 stars because of the rushed ending but overall a great Thoroughbred expect that it was sometimes confusing."
2,The web has never been so boring...,"Yes, the book is important because of the role that Tim played in creating the web. It has scattered pieces of trivia and background information that I enjoy digging up from these techno-biographies. But let's be honest: this book is a real snooze-fest. It is only engaging in the mildest sense of the term. One must concentrate hard to keep the mind from wandering. There is no color to it."
2,"Realistic Story, Unrealistic ending","This is a powerful story, but the ending just doesn't hold up as realistic. It tells women to light their husbands on fire if they beat them. This is not the way out! Most women would end up in the gas chamber for this. Farrah should have moved into a halfway house and sought counseling. Also, as we all know, when battered wives physically stand up to their abusers, they do not win. The true ending for this would have been the husband waking up amidst the flames, getting away, and beating the heck ouf of Farrah and tossing her in the burning bed. This would have been a more realistic ending, to be honest. The movie stands on its own as Farrah's finest piece of work."
5,The Burning Bed,I had to upgrade to a DVD. This is part of my curriculum and VHS tape is wearing out. Will be using this DVD from now on in my Parenting classes.
4,Gripping and real,"It isn't often that I stay up until midnight watching a movie on TV, but this movie had me hooked. It is so easy to wonder why a woman doesn't leave, yet watching Fawcett you understand the social pressures to stay, and the game that is continually played. An excellent movie, one that has no surprise ending just takes you through the journey that is almost visible from the start. Despite that you can't stop watching, it is filled with raw, human emotions."
3,"Interesting text, imperfect book","I enjoyed reading this book. However there are two things that could make it better:1. Print the title on the spine of the book.2. Reduce self-importance in the translator's preface.I have tremendous respect for the translator's martial arts achievements and his fluency in Japanese and I appreciate his regard for the warrior's way. But I would enjoy the book better-- and I think it would appeal to a wider audience-- if Mr. Tarver relaxed some of his us-versus-them attitude in the preface. For example:""Whether enlisted in the military or not, the burning desire to protect is one of the things that separate us from the sedate, self-infatuated crowd.""When I buy a book to learn about traditional samurai values-- values like humility and respect for the people you serve-- I find it distracting to have this kind of self-congradulatory language in the preface.Otherwise I found the book interesting and useful."
5,a joy to read while still being educational,These little patterns would be a delight to make and each one represents a period of time in America's history. Having viewed many vintage and antique quilts I find these little quilts are true to their periods in history both in the fabric and the patterns.In spite of the charming patterns in this book it's greatest value is it's ability to give you a sense of what it was like to be quilting during different times in history.It is good resource for historical information about the styles and periods of each project but the greatest value is in the learning the history and then making the quilt. There is something about doing something with our hands that makes the history we have learned so real.
2,tar guard,I was dissapointed when I received the pack of tar guard I threw away half the bag due to malfunction. I am not happy with this item purchased. my last order I placed was better. I would not order this again due to the tar guard defect/and being wasted. I had to buy some at the cvs. to me it was a waste of money.
1,Poor quality,I used this on my redbone hound when went running until it stopped working. It may have stopped working after I dropped it from my counter to the floor. But I expected it to be more durable for the price and not as sensitive as a cell phone.
1,"Do not buy, if it will be difficult for you to change the product.","I wish i had read the bad reviews more carefully before buying this product. I read them afterwards, my problems were the same with those of others. The device didn't work properly. I did everything in the book, many things they don't mention. It eventually started working, but it was unreliable. Exactly what you need in this kind of a product. I live outside of US, for most of the year, so exchange was not a real option. I read on of the bad reviews, took its advice and bought a tri tonics which i have been using for a while now with no problems. So, if you don't think you'll be lucky, like most of the reviewers, and it is hard to exchange. I'd say go with tri tronics. They are good."
3,works great,"My daughters American Bulldog was out of control. When he saw another dog on a walk he would lunge and pull or even when he was in a car he would about go through the windshield to get to the dog. He has made a dramatic turnaround in 1 week only using level 2 and the negative sound. Highly reccommended to get your dog out of the ""moment."""
5,Better than expected,"We have two Giant Schnauzers that are hell on wheels when someone visits. We used the collar on the worst of the two and he immediately stopped jumping up and acting wildly. Now, if he just hears the warning tone he stops the unwanted behavior. We only need when people visit. After training the young male, we used it on the female. After one use, she has stopped jumping and grabbing. She goes to a spot and waits for the visitor to approach her. Same is true with the boy. The added benefit is when we put the collar on the girl the boy still responded to the beep warning. Since they both act up at the same time this is perfect for us. We have gone from completely out of control to calm waiting.This is the only behavior that we needed this for so I can't speak to how it work for other things. Thankfully, our dogs have accepted standard training techniques for all other circumstances."
3,"Disappointing, but readable","When I first saw this novel in the bookstore, I was literally ecstatic- I had loved Getting Over It. I didn't buy it that day though, because I was broke. Then I went on Amazon and read all these reviews where people went on and on about how bad the book was and how much they wished they hadn't bought it. So I didn't buy it.A few months later, it was on sale, less than half price. So I bought it to find out what all the moaning was about. And i must say, I'm glad I listened to the reviews because it is a let down.Natalie, the main character, is soooooo annoying. The thing is, the anorexic bit doesn't start until halfway through, when her best friend confronts her about it. But before then, it's barely mentioned.The book is ok, Andy is sweet, but the whole thing with Simon and Frannie finding out was so predictable!"
1,"I would have given this book 5 stars, except","I didn't like it. Haha. Anna Maxted has some great books, but this one really wasn't one of them. It's funny, with her standard awesome humor, but it just gets long and tedious, with the protagonist sabotaging herself at every opportunity. This was one Anna Maxted that I had trouble finishing."
4,What's wrong with neurotic?,"Everyone seems annoyed with Natalie's neurosis and disorder, but I thought they were extremely well portrayed. I admit there were tons of times I wished she would just open her mouth and say what needed to be said, but the fact that she didn't is kind of the point.I really identified with Natalie and her situation. The book isn't about the typical times in her life when everything goes normally. It's about those times when everything is backwards and your best friend yells at you and you throw food at your mother and how she got through it.Bottom line, I loved it as much as Getting Over It and plan to go buy Anna Maxted's latest today!"
4,The World According to Natalie,"In spite of the depth to which we wade in Natalie's muddle, I found the the story to be a thorough treat. I even liked it better than Getting Over It.Anna is so clever, so insightful and so honest with her characterizations, it's impossible not to find the book funny and poignant at the same time.I loved the fact that she broke with convention and didn't reveal Natalie's disorder until we had a chance to form an opinion of her without that knowledge. I thought it was a wiseand courageous choice.I hope Anna's busy writing another novel."
1,Really Didn't like it.,"I am really big fan of ""Chick-lit"" and ""Running in Heels"" by Anna Maxted looked liked it would be a fun read. Well, I wasn't thirty pages into the book when I realized that it was really bad. Natalie Miller, has to most unappelling character ever. She got so many problems such as: eating disorder, relationship problems, parents problems, that I can't by the end of the book, which ones have been solved. The ending was the worst. Ms. Maxted just seemed to out of ideas, so the book just ended. This has to be one of the worst book that that I have read a long while, so just to your self the favor and don't read it."
2,what a book...,"seriously, i had never read a book that made me want to punch a hole in the wall! Until I read more than half-way through this book. Seriously, I ABSOLUTELY HATE the main character, Natalie. I wonder why they would concentrate the story on her, or even include someone like her in a novel. I understand that some people are as such, but why waste the time writing a whole novel about her?? she was not interesting AT ALL. Very Very VERY annoying. I wish I would've known before I purchased this book (at Barnes & Noble). I tried really hard to like this book, but alas... she kept getting worste as the book progressed."
2,Not Very Funny,I have read a few of Ms Maxted's books and I find them humorless. Since went has anorexia and self loathing funny. This has been a constant theme in many of her novels. Marian Keyes is a far wittier writer than Maxted
3,Surprisingly NOT bad,"An overweight person reading a book about an anorexic. I really know how to pick them, don't I? After I found out I was reading a book about an anorexic, I thought I was going to hate the book. Admitedly, it is a fluff chick-lit style book. Something about me actually liked it though. I found myself feeling emotions (albeit rarely GOOD emotions) towards the characters and I'll take moving books where I can find them."
2,Taekwondo is NOT martial arts,"Would you buy this book if the title was ""The bare essentials guide for taekwondo injuries?"". That's exactly what is it. The advise is exclusively for injuries from taekwondo - predominately impact injuries from sparring. The author says absolutely nothing about any other martial art including the grappling arts of judo, jujutsu, submission wrestling and NHB. Thus there are an entire class of injuries that are not addressed by this book. Indeed, the chapter on taping techniques is limited to feet, ankles, hands and wrists, namely the joints most affected by point sparring. Moreover, the chapters on strength and conditioning and care of injuries are perfunctory and leave the reader wanting more detailed information..."
2,Tape me up!,Most of the book is useless. The only chapters that are helpful are the sections on taping. The stretches are exercises most athletes already know and use. The useful parts of the book could actually be put in a pamphlet.
1,Typesetting has problems with diacritics,"There are free copies of this book online, but I enjoy reading paper versions so I bought this Dodo Press edition of Goethe's autobiography. This is the first time I've read Goethe and I'm really enjoying the book, except that the typesetting of this edition has problems with diacritic and other special characters. Every letter ""o"" with a diaresis (two dots on top) appears as a question mark followed by a blank space so that ""Höchst"" appears as ""H? chst"". With so many German place names, this means there's an error roughly every 5 pages. I can't believe Amazon is selling something of such poor quality for such a high price. Other special characters have the same problem, like the digraph ""ae"". So you miss out on all the place names, which is annoying. You also miss out on archaic spellings, which is one of the fun parts of reading old books. Definitely avoid the Dodo Press edition."
5,Management Challenges for the 21st Century,This book confirms my opinion that Peter Drucker is still America's management guru!
3,"interesting ideas, but a bit shallow","Drucker raises a lot of interesting issues about changes in business and society. But I found this a frustrating book to read, because he makes lots of assertions but doesn't bother substantiating them with much evidence. Apparently, we are supposed to accept his assertions just because he is a venerated guru in the business world."
5,Awesome and good read,"First feedback about this book was posted on April 4, 2000 and today is February 25, 2010. This book is still interesting, after 10 years, when lot many things, which were predicted by Drucker ten years before, have come true. This is first time I am reading management book and I am invariably enchanted by the applicability of this book."
5,Excellent!,Excellent book that makes you think of everything in a different way. Obviouly written by - in my opinion- the top in management theories.
1,Some serious problems,"I just finished the book and I noticed some serious problems. As someone who has been lifting weights for several years, I have a real problem with his lack of warm-up or cool-downs. No one in their right mind would just pick up a weight and start lifting. That is a prescription for disaster! As far as the aerobics go, I like the idea of the intervals, but 20 minutes? Study after study has shown that you need to have your heart rate up for 30 minutes or more. I'll keep my aerobic workouts longer, thank you. Finally, his nutrition information. Where, in the grand plan, is 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day? You need the fiber, not just the nutrients (which are available in the supplements?) I agree with other reviewers, you many be getting a buff body out of this plan, but where is the health? Like any other book, I'll keep some ideas, but the majority of the book will not be used."
4,Exersize,This book has a lot of good information and it is easy to understand. It is a good book for any level you are at. Beginners can easily read this and come up with diverse and safe exersizes to do.
4,An Effective Method,"This system helped me push my ho-hum workout ethic into full gear. The book is like a cleverly disguised beginners guide to weight training. It replaces most of the boring cardio I've been struggling with lifting and has gotten me solid results so far (1 month in).I give the book a four since it pushes Myloflex pretty hard. This is basically a vitamin based meal replacement you take between lunch and dinner. It costs about $100 for 40 shakes, or 20 days worth of the stuff. Unfortunately, formula gives me a slight headache and threw off my concentration at work. I now use fitness bars instead.The workouts are tough, but brief. Just as they should be. A great guide and a great system."
2,BE FORWARNED,"Remember before you even think of buying this book that there are a few prerequisites before you can even think of getting started. 1.) The required excercises must be done in a gym. 2.) You need 20 minutes 3 days a week, and 45 minutes 3 days a week for the excercises. 3.) The program relies heavily on supplements which happen to be manufactured by the author's former employer. So besides the investment of the book (Which you don't even need because all the info is free on the web site for free), you need a gym membership and a budget for supplements. Be careful if you are a novice dieter or weightlifter--this is not for you."
2,To be totally fair...,"I used to be an enormous fan of Philips and Muscle Media before their change in image lately. However, MM as a whole is not what should be commented on in reviewing this book.You can generally find as good or better information than this in the books at your local library as well as at websites. For that matter, researching ""fitness"", ""weight training"" on a powerful search engine will probably turn up as much information as you can learn here.The motivation aspect of this book is lauded a great deal. If it's motivation you lack, then pick up a book by a good self-help author like Stephen Covey or Tony Robbins.All in all, unless you have dreams of winning one of EAS's contests, you honestly do not need Philips or this book for anything."
1,A book for beginners who know nothing about fitness,"The sad truth is that a very large part of the population is obese or don't work out at all. The methods in this book are nothing out of the ordinary and way to easy and simple for anyone that knows anything about being fit. The obese and out of shape people will reach the same if not better results by doing virtually any exercise. When you are in that poor condition, whatever you do will improve your pathetic shape. If you have any experience at all of working out, don't buy this book. It's a waste of time."
4,lost 30 pounds,"This approach was totally inspiring and was not that difficult to follow. The eating guidelines are quite simple, and the exercise routines are set to one's abilities and pace. The stories and photos of Bill's successes are remarkable and quite motivating!"
5,Just Do It!,"Hello??? To all of you who wrote the negative reviews...no wonder this book did not speak to or work for you, pessimism will get you nowhere fast. I have seen results in four weeks and by the way if you watch the video you know that all finalists were tested for chemical use. THIS BOOK IS FABULOUS AS IS HIS VIDEO ""BODY OF WORK""."
1,If your ONLY concern is how you look...,"If you are only worried about how you look, this may be the book for you. For those looking to feel better as well as look better, should look elsewhere. Much of the problem with this book is that is barely covers total health. Recent studies on meal replacements powders are not good and this book suggest large quantities of those same products. Total body health does not seem to be the focus of this book. How many of you know people who have dedicated years to looking big and strong? Today those same people may be fat and have heart problems, kidney problems, liver problems, etc. The focus on having ""ultimate body"" can be your worst enemy in the future."
1,I don't need a guru,"Having read this book, I'm not surprised about all the positive reviews. Giving this negative review I feel like the one person in Jonestown saying ""Don't drink the Kool-Aid!"" Weak people need a leader, someone to tell them how to think and feel, someone to program their actions. The masses tend to search these people out and raise them to demi god status. I understand your desire to have someone make each decision for you but Bill Phillips' is not worthy of your praise. Phillips is building a small fortune on the weak. Do you need this? Would you have swallowed the Kool-Aid? Buy into fitness, not a cult."
5,Tried and true training information that works!,"I am a former bodybuilder who has gained quite a bit of weight in the last 10 years. What I have lacked was motiviation, and encouragement. The training and nutrition program outlined in this book is what I learned 10 years ago. IT WORKS!! I received the Body-For-Life book from a friend, and read it in one day. I can't remember the last time I was so excited. Bill Phillips CARES about the individual, and it is evident from this book. As far as those people who say it's advertising hype, there are about 3 pages that mention Myoplex, as an easy and effective meal substitute, but it says RIGHT IN THE BOOK that you don't have to use Myoplex (or any EAS supplement or ANY supplement). I look foward to changing my life. You can do it too!! My start date is August 8. I'll be back the end of October to let you know the results!"
3,If you have will power and discipline...,The principles here are very sound and simple. Eat sensibly and hit the gym everyday save for one day a week. The main problem here is a) sticking with the program b) not spending your life savings on Myoplex shakes.
1,Wake up,"People, people wake up. Bill Phillips is out to do nothing but to make money and push his supplements on you. There is NOTHING amazing in this book except the same rhetoric you'll find in his ""no holds barred"" sections of Muscle Media, a magazine that I do like. But this book is seriously nothing but a big advertisement with a few simple exercises in it. Don't belive the hype. You CAN lose weight WITHOUT supplements these days. Think about it, before all these supplements people still looked good and lost weight right? You DONT need supplements and you DONT need this book. All it takes is old-fashion hard work. Put in the work and the results will come."
5,works to live by,"Great book, had borrowed a copy and loved it so much had to get my own. Great way to kick up your workout and take it to the next level!"
1,Program not easy for average person,"This book does not provide the structure required for the food end of the diet. It has great descriptions of the exercises and planning. The food however is briefly decribed as to the benefits of each grouping and a one week meal plan is included. The (not-so-cheap) protein powder is also prominently featured and ""suggested"" as well. Unless you have ALOT of extra time to plan this program around the rest of your life, this may not be the plan for you."
1,Proganda - Retouched Photos,"Unbelievable! This book is the worst piece of propaganda that's out there. I couldn't believe the advice he was giving. In addition to that, the photos looked retouched!!! Not all the photos were retouched but there are some that have for sure been manipulated. I'm a computer graphics designer and I can recognize photos that have been retouched."
2,12 weeks of disapointement !,"Hi, I'm not Bill Phillips, but I followed 12 week program just like everyone else and bought so many supplements and worked real hard!This book is primarily for people that are trying to loose fat,I wasn't fat...I was too lean and wanted to gain some muscles.What was the end result? yes I did gain some muscles... but not as half as good as these transformation pictures....What Bill dosen't tell you in his book is what I later found out that most of these people took at least six months or even longer to make such a dramatic change, and I was very frustrated and disapointed since I never financialy planned for it to take so long....that I quit the program, and few weeks later I went back to my normal weight, even the few muscles I had put on during the program were gone."
1,It's funny to call the other muscle mags steroid mags...,"I noticed on reviewer here say that MuscleMedia is the magazine that has changed lives and the other magazines are steroid mags. MuscleMedia was the original steroid magazine. Although they did not publish photos of those steroid freaks, they did publish articles about how to buy and use steroids. Are memories so short and the propaganda so great that some should skip reality? This book could have been better. Bill Phillips is a smart guy, maybe his next book will be better."
5,Great program,"This is a great book for all people! Not only does it include a great program to weight loss and fitness, it is inspirational. Bill's ideas and theories can be used in all aspects of your life. If you don't come away from this book a changed person, it is your own fault! I read someone else's comment about how the web address is on the bottom of every page and they thought it was terrible. SO WHAT! While it may be overkill, the web site does provide some great information also, including recipes, exercise tips and more. I have just started my program and whether or not I end up looking like one of the after pictures, I know I will be a healthier, more confident, happier person."
4,"Simple, Foolish, Waste of Print? I don't think so!!!","This book is for anyone who is looking for proven results and has DECIDED to make a change. The techniques described in the book are solid. I feel the book offers a great deal of motivation and provides beginners with enough information to make some positive changes for themselves. He goes over nutrition and exercise. Granted this information isn't a revalation however, to find it all together as it is presented in this book would be take more time than it would to buy the book, get it, read it and even go to your first workout. The part I like the most... all the proceeds from the book go to Make a Wish Foundation!BTW: When I first heard about this I too felt it was just a gimmick but now I know different."
1,A useless advertising... and you'll PAY for that?,"This book is really not worth buying. All you get here are basic exercises you can find in any book for people starting to train with weights, and basic nutrition advices as well. You can find the same and more for 2$ in second-hand ""get into shape"" books, or for free by browsing the Internet. There are pretty good sites that give advices for free, and don't advertise for supplements. This is the main drawback of this book, and that's exactly where it loses credibility. By advertising for products he sells, the author shows the real goal of his book. So not only he earns money with a not really useful book, but he tells people to buy his products, which are quite useless to a beginner! So this book is basically just an advertisement. You have the choice of buying into this marketing sheme, or look for real info elsewhere. If you really want to do something about your shape, get another book."
5,Right on the money!,"Let's face it, this book isn't for everyone. It's for the people who are looking for a tried and true method for success. You want to get in shape and you want to have the whole plan spelled out for you. Well, here it is! I've used EAS supplements and had great results and all my guidance has been from Bill Phillips. If you buy this book you WILL NOT be dissapointed!"
1,What a waste!,"After watching Montel, I decided to buy the book. The people on the show seemed to have such fabulous results. But after reading the book, there is no way that I can do this ""diet."" You have to belong to a gym (or own a lot of your own equipment) to do the exercises this diet requires. The exercises require specific timing and duration. In addition, you also have to eat 6 ""balanced"" meals a day. Who has the time or money to do that? I've decided that this is just too complicated!"
1,Don't waste your hard earned money on this book of eas ads,"Why did bill phillips write this book? 1. to sell eas product. 2. to congragulate himself 3. to let everyone know how ""awesome"" he is. People, you will find nothing new here as far as fitness training goes. I'll bet the five star reviews are from his staff."
1,Not what I wanted,"The book really wasn't what I was looking for. The material isn't necessarily bad, I just expected something a little different."
1,All Hail Bill Phillips!,Bill Phillips is a marketing genius. My hats off to someone who can charge money for a book telling you to buy mid quality products for the highest prices on the market. This is amazing.
5,Life changing!,"I don't care what kind of shape you are in, you need this book. I sat down and read it in one day! Bill is easy to read, straightforward, and very motivational! Read this and change your life - you will not regret it."
1,Do not buy this book!,"It was the biggest waste of 12 weeks ever! I lost maybe a total of 5 lbs and toned up a little bit. For those of you with binge eating problems like myself the free day looks heaven sent, but it cost me my sucess. The book is not oriented for people with our mentality.Also, I found articles on the internet that claimed the photos are retouched and some of the people are not even part of the program.This book tells you what you already know. Eat healthy and exercise. My advice... their is no better weight loss coach than yourself."
3,**IRON MAN MARKETING MACHINE**GOOD LUCK CHUCK AT LONG TERM,"His ability to market is LEGEND...Does his program work long-term for all? I wish it did. Is it one of the best books every written on fitness? It's certainly one of the most helpful and widely read, if not applied. If you have never seen it before, it may just blow you away. Will it be your long term solution? Lot's of good, solid, advice; difficult to follow long-term."
5,Great step by step techniques,"After reading a preview in Muscle Media Magazine, I started Bill's twelve week exercise plan approximately six weeks before the book came out. Although I have been working out for years, I have never been able to break out of an average body. I looked around at the gym and coveted those washboard abs on the other guys. On about my sixth week, people in the gym noticed my the changes in my body and asked me about my workout. Two weeks ago I got the book and started the meal plans. The results are astounding. I can't imagine where I would be had I started the meals from day one. I already have my best body better and I have a month to go! By the end of the twelve weeks period I will have those washboard abs. From there I plan to set a new set of goals. This book gives simple step by step techniques that will allow you to make drastic changes in your body. If you are committed to making your body look better, this book is for you."
5,Changed my life,"As a person who was out of shape, over weight and unmotivated, this book changed all that. Finally got tired of buying larger pants and decided to do something. Got this book after seeing Bill Philips on Montel Williams show. Read it followed it, and no I did not use the supplements, and in 12 weeks went from 19% body fat to 8.5%. Went from a stomach over my belt to a flat six pack set of abs. Feel great and energy has gone into other parts of my life.Will warn you however the program is not EASY. If you want results you have to WORK for them. Follow the plan in the book and put 100% effort into it and you will get the results you want. I also saw other at the gym, like myself who had the BFL workout sheets. They did not put the effort in and then complained that the program did not work. Not true, they did not work. You MUST put the effort in to get the RESULTS out."
5,YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS!,"My husband and I have been doing Body for Life and LOVE IT! THIS PROGRAM WORKS! The daily workouts and daily eating plan are easy to follow. When you start seeing muscles you never knew you had, a flatter stomach, when you feel stronger and healthier...you will not want to stop!! Body for Life is a healthy, sensible program anyone can do. Bill Phillips knows what he is talking about, he is an expert in this field. Just look at BFL's track record - all the success stories and you will be convinced! We were sceptical at first but after trying the program for two weeks, we did not want to stop! The results are amazing! Just try it. . .you've got nothing to lose (but weight)!"
3,Pricey!,"Of course lifting weights, eating protein, and doing moderate aerobics will work. What is a scam are the supplements. You should not have to shell out 200 bucks a month for supplements. You can eat protein and get other supplements at a cheaper price."
2,"Blah, blah, blah...heard it before!","I admit that this author suggests some nice things and I'm sure that if you work his program it may or may not work. The problem is that all of his suggestions are cliche and lacking in originality and freshness. Nothing new here, same old song and dance."
3,Need the Motivation? Read the book.,"Just how many reviews has this book received anyway? (That alone should tell you something.) Body for Life is an excellent one stop shop for information on starting a body altering excercise routine. If you aren't a long time subscriber to Muscle Media, then it's worth the $ to have all the info you need in one place. Much of the information has been said in past copies of MM, and on Bills web site, but the book ties it all together. It also takes you through some self exploration that many of us need and some others do not. I'd buy it again."
5,A must read for team leaders and those desiring to be one!,"Dr. Stewart and the team at SOMC have composed a must-read for every team leader and those aspiring to organizational leadership. Dr. Stewart takes concepts and principals of which we are all aware and makes them real. He allows us to see ourselves and the others with whom we interact at work in ""3-D"", offering insights for dealing with every different kind of leadership style. He even reminds us that we don't have to act on every situation. He actually gives permission to ignore certain behaviors and instructs how to deal with negativity and naysayers in the workplace. The book is most helpful in validating what I feel I'm doing right while setting me straight in areas I'm needing to improve in my quest to maintain my effectiveness in my leadership role in my company.Reading is a luxury for busy people or at least it is for me, but if you only have time for one great book to put you to the top, this is definitely the one!"
1,Does not work!,"I tried this diet and I lost 3 pounds the first week then hit a plateau and couldn't lose anymore. Since I love pasta, I tried low carb pasta but it's hard and grainy because it doesn't absorb water like normal pasta. My craving for sweets did not go away, and I felt hungry all the time. And eating more meat made me feel sluggish. I started losing weight on a low fat diet but haven't lost much because of a medical problem that makes me too tired to exercise (I had been exercising with the SugarBusters diet and I suspect that's the real reason why I lost those 3 pounds). However, the low fat diet does make me feel better and gives me better digestion. I also can't help noticing that every person I know who says they have had success with a low carb diet is a man. Maybe women have different nutritional needs, I don't know, but this just didn't work for me."
2,Wrong air filter for Subaru 2.5L - Come on Amazon,"Review is about the listing, not the filter.50% of the air filters (3 of 6) listed for the Subie 2005-2010 2.5L H4 DO NOT FIT. The filter needs to be approximately 8 x8 in. This filter is 8 x 12.That said, the filter looks pretty much like the K&N; filters I have had on cars in the past (cone type custom application)I can't find a way to contact Amazon to communicate the problem - this is the 1st time I have been really frustrated with Amazon."
1,NOT FOR THE SUBARU 2007 OUTBACK,"The other reviewer was quite correct, this IS NOT THE CORRECT FILTER FOR THE SUBARU OUTBACK. What a waste of time!!"
5,A FANTASTIC DISCOVERY!,"A FANTASTIC DISCOVERY! Jackie Ryan is my favorite singer, period! She does it all. She has right-on pitch, power, sensitivity, range and above all SOUL! Something lacking in most I have heard these days. Check out this CD. You will not be disappointed. She should be a household name."
4,Good for the classroom or self study.,"Every so often certification exams are updated to meet the challenge of new and emerging technologies. Network+ is certainly no exception to this rule. Having taken the newest exam is it apparent that more than just reading the books you must also practice the concepts and this lab manual will help in that endeavor.As a prefect companion to the All-In-One Network+ exam guide book, you have over 50 hands-on labs to help make the understanding of the exam objectives easier and more comprehensible.Each lab has the exam objectives listed and are setup in a step by step format, along with the materials you'll need in order to complete the labs. Once completed there is a lesson wrap up to go over the major points in a review fashion.Overall this book does meet all the newest exam objectives and would make a great self study tool or for use in a classroom training environment."
1,Outdated book-not what expected.,"the network+ lab book is old (2002), not written by mike meyers. the labs are well, not actual 'labs' as much as they are research-type questions that are answered. in all fairness, I'm on ch 3 only, but I've reviewed other chapters like the TCP/IP section and it seems better. it was getting down to it's protocols and subnetting. so, while it's not a 'how to' it is a 'review' type of lab book."
2,THE BOOK WAS RUINED NOT THE GOD.,THE FIRST TWO THIRDS OF THIS BOOK DEALING MAINLY WITH POLITICAL MACHINATIONS WAS WELL DONE AND CAREFULLY MANIPULATED. THE LAST THIRD DEALT LARGELY WITH POLEMICS AND LITTLE INFORMATIN. THE END WAS BROADCAST FRON ABOUT PAGE 300.IT IS NOT UP TO HIS USUAL STANDARD.
1,Who wrote this?,"I was shocked at the lack of continuitiy in story-line and generally poor writing. My husband was reading another Uris book concurrently and I kept asking him what he thought of Uris writing style. My husband said A-. I began to think either I was crazy or my husband was, but since I have been reading other reviews of A God In Ruins, I realize we are both right. Something bad happened to Mr Uris at the time he wrote this book...but what? It is not a fair representation of his talent and I am befuddled enough to take time to write this review. God in Ruins is a definite 'don't read.' Read something else like The Haj or Exodus. I think his family should take this one out of circulation. God bless and rest Mr. Uris soul!"
1,Quick! Call the Cops!,"Because someone has apparently kidnapped Leon Uris!This book is so bad, I don't even know where to start. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is a hodge-podge of what appear to be Uris' pet peeves, the editing and factual errors were both irritating and shocking for such an accomplished author, the dialog was implausible, and the sychophantic fawning over Bill Clinton really was sickening -- ""the agony that befell Bill and Hillary Clinton""??? Oh, puleeeze.As for his take on the Second Amendment, all I kept thinking was how odd that the same man who had written so eloquently about the Irish struggle for freedom --- the ARMED struggle for freedom, by the way -- had suddenly become so cavalier about American freedoms. What in the world would Conor Larkin say?Don't waste your time reading this tripe. In fact, plant a tree tomorrow to replace those that were sacrificed to print ""A God In Ruins"". You'll feel better."
1,Very relieved to see that I am not alone!,"After reading about half of the book (I was stuck in an airport and had no choice), I finally did something I've never done. I put the book down with no intentions of ever picking it up again. I couldn't believe that this was the same writer of Mila 18 and Trinity! I, therefore, am greatly relieved to see that I am not alone in my opinion of this extraordinarily trite book. Thank you to all the other reviewers - I wish I'd read your reviews before buying this book!"
1,Uris lets us down,"I'm a fan of Mr. Uris and when I saw this book in an airport before a long flight, I was excited. That excitement didn't last long. DO NOT BUY this book! It is shallow and was apparently rapidly written and edited. There are some glaring errors in the book and the main characters are stereotypical. I don't mind an author with an agenda - I love Gore Vidal, but don't agree with him on much politically - but there has to be something of value in the writing. Nothing here!"
1,Disappointing bigotry,"It is hard for me equate this writing of Mr. Uris with the likes of Battle Cry, Mila 18, QB VII or Exodus. This book is very ugly in its' treatment of Christians, Southerners and of course Republicans, treats the Clintons as martyrs and the Catholic Church as a hot bed of adulterers. Marines are treated very well (deservedly so)but the Nation that has created and supported them does not do as well. Maybe it is time for retirement and put away the poison pen."
1,He should stick to historical settings,"Uris demonstrates in this novel that, while he is excellent at weaving a human story around historical events, he is unable to fashion a believable story without such a setting. His lack of knowledge concerning computer technology and firearms (the issues of his two antagonists) renders this book as grossly unreal. Uris is definitely not cut out to write science-fiction. If they offered the choice of less than 1 star, this book would have gotten it. No other author has ever disappointed me this thoroughly."
1,A Sad Farewell to Leon Uris,"`A God In Ruins' indeed. Leon Uris' latest work -- perhaps an indication that he is the god in ruins. I grew up on Leon Uris and came, over the course of three decades, to revel in his attention to detail, his grounding in truth, his objectivity and his ability to weave a tale that had a point and yet did not preach. In 'A God In Ruins', Uris has become a one-eye-blind street preacher, sermonizing the book away through barely possible characters, a semi-credible plot and a set of issues that, although important, do not justify the context of the book. As though to add insult to injury, the book is full of little errors -- ridiculous things such as Eastern time being three hours behind Pacific.I bid sad farewell to Mr. Uris' work, hoping only that I can revisit `Battle Cry' in all its glory un-tainted."
2,Somewhat entertaining.,"Mr. Uris wrote eight great novels in a row, peaking with ""Trinity"". With the last three novels, including ""A God in Ruins"", Mr. Uris seems to be living on his reputation.The passion and power of ""Trinity"" and ""Exodus"" are non-existent in ""A God in Ruins"".Mr. Uris clearly is very sympathetic to Bill Clinton and his political problems. In ""Trinity"", Mr. Uris created the Conor Larkin character seeking his truth about Irish freedom. It is hard to compare that quest with Bill Clinton seeking his truth in 800 FBI files that were ""accidently"" transferred to the White House."
1,A total waste of time,"I could not believe that the author of so many great stories could produce a book as poor as this one. I would have given it a rating of NO STARS if I could have. The book has no redeeming qualities and it appears that Uris has gone senile or has hired a high school ghost writer. My advise, don't even read the inside cover of the book as it bears very little relationship to the actual story and plot. THE BOOK IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!!!"
1,Awful. Re-read one of Uris' earlier books instead.,"Had this been a first novel, the author would have collected rejection letters from every publisher in town. Technically flawed, sophomoric dialog and descriptions, paper-thin characters and badly edited to boot. A God in Ruins is a thinly disguised vehicle for the author's liberal agenda, nothing more. For shame, Mr. Uris."
5,The Best Book I've read in ten years!,"I am a dedicated reader of fiction and a would-be author. I found ""A God In Ruins"" to be both inspirational and emotional. Uris has a message and he conveys it extraordinarily well. His character development is to die for. A book for modern America, timely."
5,"A great ""beach"" read! Begs a sequel.","I don't know what book the other ""reviewers"" read, but I couldn't put this one down. Having read ALL of Uris' other works, I rank this one among his best. It was a bit reminiscent of Ayn Rands' idealistic stories. Maybe I'm not the cynic that some are, but I'm hopeful a person as idealistic and morally correct as Quinn Patrick O'Connell will come along to lead us out of the miasma of soft money and slimy politics and into the future. I totally agree with Mr. Uris re: the 2nd Amendment, the sorry state of racism, the prurient interests of the media and the public in devouring the escapades of Bill & Monica (yuk!) and the loss of delight of the American school child in taking a family trip to the library. Brave stroke, Mr. Uris. Fear not and write on! I'll read you!! Regards - L. Dale O'Donnell Sease - Denver."
1,A horrible waste of time and money,"I only wish I had read the reviews before obtaining the book. Like many others contributing here, I have read and enjoyed many of Mr. Uris' earlier books, but this one was horrible beyond belief. I can't believe I even finished reading the thing but I can tell you it certainly ruined my day. Save your money!"
5,"Thank You, Dennis Shulman, for This Excellent Book","A few weeks ago, I happened to hear Dennis Shulman interviewed about his book on National Public Radio, and I was so impressed with him and what he said that I immediately orderd his book. Shulman's book is an outstanding, comprehensive and loving analysis of the Book of Genesis. Although I have been reading these same Genesis stories for more than forty years, since my childhood, I now feel like I finally understand them. What's more, because of this wonderful book, these stories now speak to me. Shulman's book is a good read and a work of inspiration. Thank you, Dennis Shulman, for your book."
4,Split Pea Soup,The size is perfect. The flavor is a little weak for a good split pea soup. I would order it again.
3,Just ok!,"I purchased this brush because I thought it would help to straighten out my hair during the blow-drying process. It works ok, but I had a little difficulty using it so I never used it again."
1,From Fiction to Final Print: How to Sell Rubbish,"It read like a cheesy suspense novel with cliché after cliché. It would be nice if this blissfully ignorant idea of Satanism (I was amused by the ""coven"" bit) to be God-hating were anywhere near the truth, but to each their own and to myself, a good helping of factuality."
1,A very dangerous product which is almost impossible to set,"I bought four traps. It is very difficult to set them, and they are dangerous. The plastic trap has an insufficiently deep seat for the locking bar, so it is unlocking when you are trying to place the trap on the floor. Eventually I managed to set two and to kill two mice, but the third trap jumped up and strongly hit my thumb. The use of this Victor device should be banned."
1,Victor M038 Easy Set Mouse Trap,I agree with the many other reviewers who feel this mousetrap is JUNK! Look for the older style with the metal bait platform and triggerwire catch if you can find 'em - they actually catch mice (as opposed to just feeding them). This M038 model with the plastic bait platform misses at least 50% of the time and that's if you are able to set the darn thing in the first place.
2,A step backwards,"I've used the old version of this trap, the one with the metal bait platform, for many years and had 100% success. This version works about 25% of the time. Either the mouse takes the bait without setting off the trap or it releases spontaneously due to temperature change or minor floor vibrations. Living in the country I have to set traps indoors and in unheated out buildings.For bait I use sunflower seed from the bird feeder because it doesn't get rancid, you don't have to be refresh it on a regular basis, it's not messy, and it is easy to secure on the metal bait platform. This is not the case with this version where you have to use seed just the right diameter to securely insert it in one of the holes in the plastic platform without destroying the seed."
2,Not so easy to set,"These traps work just fine once you are able to set and place them as you want. It often takes two or three tries, including a few near-heart attacks to get them to set properly without snapping closed before you are able to get your hand off of them."
5,Perfect trap.,"I really don't understand all these complaints about this trap. They work...period. I scattered these around our kitchen and basement to deal with a mouse problem. 5 dead mice later, we no longer have a mouse problem. Yes, you have to be careful when you place them on the floor, or they'll snap. That's good! You want them to be sensitive. Bait them with peanut butter and just wait for the carcasses."
5,Safety plus comfort! We have a winner!,"My son has a sensitive stomach. His previous carseat (Graco) always produced spit-up, no matter how long I tried to wait before taking him after feeding him. Now he can ride right after eating and is completely comfortable. Plus with the slim design, he can look out the window better. This is a huge help with reducing tears on longer drives. He sleeps comfortably without a lot of head lolling and strange positions. Even better than the one (Eddie Bauer) my husband got for his car too!Only downside is the weight. But since it stays in my car 90% of the time, its just fine for us! Easy to seatbelt back in after removal when needed.I am thrilled that he is so safe AND comfortable!"
2,"Horrible convertible car seat, not worth the money","I bought this seat for my son after reading other reviewers email raving of how wonderful the seat is. As matter of fact, it is over-price, not as comfortable as I though it would be after spending $250 for this seat(I didn't buy it from AMAZON though). When you place the seat in a forward facing it does not give you a 45 degree angle. Making it very a bad posture for my son. POOR Instructions, very confusing to follow. It wasn't easy to assemble. The only thing that it does is, it could fold for traveling. I wish I didn't buy this seat.I went ahead and bought a different convertible seat for my son, it is called First Year True Fit convertible seat. It is much more comfortable, very easy or to none to assemble. Easy to follow instructions. This seat cost $75 less I love the seat and so is my son. My recommendation is DON'T WASTE your money on this seat. BUY THE FIRST YEAR TRUE FIT Convertible seat instead. Trust me you won't regret it."
3,Radian 80 convertible car seat,"I bought this product after reading other user's reviews...I haven't used it yet but putting it together and using it have proven to be quite a pain. I hope it turns out to be worth it. Also, it seems like it might be too large for a newborn by just looking at it."
4,"Great carseat, but not super cool style...","This was our second Radian 80 and we love the carseat. However, the SuperCool style is anything but super cool! The polyester covering gives it a weird texture and it just doesn't look as nice as our other one. I still think that the strap between the legs can be a bit short for older children(you can request a bit of a longer one from the company I think). Overall, the safety aspect of the Radian by far overshadows the style, but still..."
3,It's Okay,It's a good book but not quite what I hoped for. Was hoping for more depth (replacing CPU fan) for one.
5,Knuckle busting action!,"This is an awsome book that every serious smallmouth angler needs to have. This contains a no-nonsence approach to improving your enjoymet of catching the smallmouth. It will teach you where to find the bass, how to catch them, what flies to use- from top to bottom, how to tie effective patterns. This is written on a level that a beginning angler or vetran fly fisherman can understand."
1,WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ and I read a LOT!,"Ditto to everything negative everyone else said about this book. Insulting to the reader's intelligence. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Recommended only for insomniacs."
5,A delightful Christmas tale with a great moral,"""Elves Can't Dunk"" is a delightful story appropriate for kids ages 6-10 who are comfortable with chapter books. The colorful cover is eye-catching, and Robert Skead proves to be a first rate children's writer with his witty interaction between the good guys and the bad. This story is a lot of fun, plus there is a good moral in the end. For kids who love basketball, this holiday story will certainly be right up their alley."
1,Another defective book!,"I'm confused! I re-ordered this book (returned the defective one)and received another defective book! The pages opposite the spine of the book are jagged and have a strange, uneven, torn look. This is the second time this has happened with the same book! I need to send this one back too. Thanks for prompting this response! Disappointed in Michigan"
2,Low clearences,I just purchased this book and found it to be very good until I wanted to check for a low clearence. Each state has all of their counties listed with the clearences in feet and inches. The bad news no where on any of the maps does it name any counties. So the book is useless to me for that reason.
1,blah,"hated the book, hated the class i got the book for and hated the teacher even more. so i guess the book was the best thing out of the process."
2,Unabridged? I don't think so.,"Yes, Poe is an extraordinary storyteller. Yes, his content is magnificent. Yes, he is a grandmaster of American literature. My poor review of this CD set is removed from Poe himself, but with the word ""Unabridged"" that is unabashedly displayed on the cover. While some of the stories do appear in their original form, many are cut, truncated, and butchered. The performances are extraordinary, sometimes chilling, renditions; however, they are not, as promised, ""Unabridged."" If it wasn't for that one word, that one promise of content on the packaging, I would give this set five stars."
5,Funniest book EVER!,"First time I read this book I laughed until I cried. Very emotionally stimulating, and the ear-worms will not let you alone."
4,"Funny, but the book on tape format begged the question...","...'why not include parts of the actual songs?'Yes, I realize it would be a publishing nightmare - trying to convince someone to let you use their song just so you could make fun of it, but it would have been so much more effective!Oh well, what might have been!This really is a funny book. Dave's quirky sense of humor was effective, as always. I thoroughly enjoyed Dave's list of bad songs and his analytical dissection of the lyrics, especially when I also intensely disliked the song. However, I liked it even more when I actually loved the song ('American Pie' comes to mind)!"
1,DON'T Buy The Audio Version!,"Now I know how much of comedy is TIMING. This tape was HORRIBLE! What might have been funny if read by Dave Barry, or even if I read it myself (if I'd gotten the book), was root-canal-like painful read by Mike Dodge, whose delivery reminds me of every safety training video I've ever heard.The producers must have known how un-funny his delivery made the material, as they even added ""pa-da"" drum staccatos to let us know when a joke was being made. If you love Dave Barry, DON'T buy this tape - it'll kill you to hear the material so butchered."
5,Wee Sing Around the World is Wonderful,I bought this cd for my 17 month old daughter. She absolutely loves it. She listens attentively to each and every song and lights up when we play the cd. Each Wee Sing disc we've listened to she adores. Great buy!
2,Not the great buy that it seems,"My problem is different from the other reviewers. Maybe I'm not the espresso taste connosseuir(sp?) that the other reviewers are, but I was perfectly happy with the machine.... when it worked.I got the machine and used it about 10 times... then the frother just stopped delivering any steam. I sent it back and got another one. Used the second one about 10 times, and guess what? You guessed it... it stopped delivering steam in the frother again. Arghhh!!!Maybe I just got a couple of them out of a bad lot; I don't know. But, I would not buy this machine again."
3,Whats else can you get for this price,"I have only used the machine once/twice and it seems not great but ok to me, for the price . I did have trouble opening the screw on the steam wand to clean it. The espresso was ok but very little crema."
1,Absolute Garbage,This radio is truly a cheap product. The first one I had never worked with the XM Antenna - I returned it and the seond one promtply stopped working as well. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,the GPX xm boombox is a piece of junk,"it is cheap, and it is not even worth it at that price. Got it last year as a gift..then I had to spend extra money to get the xm antenna separately. Clumsy and awkward to deal with. I rarely used it, and as of yesterday it wont work at all.. not even am or fm signal. Forget this one unless you don't mind trhowing away your money."
1,Worst electronic product I've ever bought!,"I've had mine for about a year now. One of the 2 speakers stopped working the first month or two. It never sounded great and now became almost worthless, but I kept it because it plays MP3s & nothing else in the house does. This morning it stopped recognizing that there is a CD or MP3 in it at all. Now it's in the trash. I had tried taking it back to Best Buy where I got it when the speaker first went out but they wouldn't take it back. (They have a terrible return policy.)As of this moment there are 3 1-star ratings and mine will be the 4th. We took time to write it so you don't waste your money. I hope you listen."
5,Awesome,"I have been participating in the Audubon's annual ""Bird Watch"" for 5 years now.. but when I would go on their website I couldn't identify 1/2 of the birds that I'd see in my backyard!! So I bought a (different) bird guide but you would already have to know the type of bird you were looking for to find it! I'm NOT an expert just an amateur wildlife enthusiast! Well this book is PERFECT!! Even I can figure out what I'm looking at now!! And the book itself arrived in perfect condition and much earlier than I had expected it, so when it came I wasn't even sure what it was. So, I am very, very pleased by the price I paid, the item I received, the condition it is in & it's super timely arrival!"
5,SOARS LIKE A FALCON,"This is without a doubt the best book for ornithologists and lay persons interested in birds. The illustrations are nonpareil and the accompanying text is a treasure trove of information. This book is the definitive books about birds to date. It is outstanding.Sibley speaks to his readers' collective intelligence; his work provides comprehensive material in a very interesting format. He is a master communicator; his readers will readily absorb the information he wishes to impart in this work and will certainly appreciate the illustrations.Sibley has indeed set new standards, soared across new frontiers in this presentation. This is a book that will not only be studied and remembered, but cherished and treasured."
4,Good Quality,Book came to me new without flaws or defects. Bought this for a class online because it was cheaper than what my school store sold it for. At the end of the class I sold it back to the school store for a profit. Can't argue with that.
5,Football Passing Machine,"Santa brought the passing machine to my 7 year old sports fanatic and he LOVES it (not to mention his dad). It does require some skill to catch the ball, but I have no doubt that it will help him develop his catching skills. I highly recommend this machine for anyone who is serious in learning how to catch the football!"
5,Very Nice!,This machine is definitely helping my boy learn how to catch the football and is so much fun. My son is enjoying it very much and I am happy to see him happy with it. I recommend it.
5,Ravishing harp concertos from Scandinavia,"Three young composers are represented in this album. The music is absolutely first rate; the performance is exquisite and the sound is impeccable. When I first listened to this CD I felt grasped by the outstanding and captivating sounds. Excellent, highly recommended for people who like contemporary music."
3,Dio finally starting to show his age,"I was really wondering how long he could possibly keep putting out records and wailing with his amazing voice. Well, this disc is finally the answer that no one can pull off metal infinitely. Even the master, who has rocked longer than anyone else I can think of (besides Mick Jagger), is really straining on this disc. Thanks for the great career, Ronnie. You've given us more wonderful music than most. Now, it's probably time to shift gears a bit and maybe do a twilight bow. Maybe something quiet, acoustic, in a John Prine vein. Really shock 'em one last time. The heavy rock dragon has finally landed, though."
2,A great tired old man,"At 64 years old RJD is showing his age. The first time I saw Dio was in 1980 supporting Heaven & Hell with Sabbath. Yep, 26 years ago. Furthermore, I saw him a few times during his solo career up to 1996. Dio up to this time had no equal behind the mic. But...after hearing this latest CD, it is quite obvious that after more than 40 years of belting out those amazing vocals the time has come to hang it up. Sorry Ronnie, you were the god for a long long time, but as Jack Black sang, ""it's time for you to pass the torch"". Enjoy the retirement, b/c you deserve it."
5,Fantastic Read!,"These books (Changeling and Madwand) are fantastic to read. I really don't want to give any more of the plot away than the product description already has. Changeling (the first book) is an epic tale of magic vs science/technology. Madwand picks up soon after Changeling leaves off. It leads you farther into the strange alternate world of magic that Zelazny only skims through in the first book. It was also a relatively easy read, and I breezed through it, which is normally diffucult for me to do, but Zelazny keeps the books at a fast past while somehow maintaining great detail. I highly recommend this series.One miniscule downside. There is a decent ending to the two book series, but there will be a reason why many readers are left wanting more. Apparently Zelazny passed away before he was able to finish the third book in the series. Aside from this, you won't regret reading Wizard World."
4,Very good,"I had been learning Hindi via Rosetta Stone, which is probably the best method overall, but I was frustrated by consistently being puzzled by what appeared to be inconsistencies in script. When I opened this book, a flood of my long-standing questions were instantly answwered, with just the right amount of geeking out for my taste. I printed out some handwriting practice pages from [...], used them for lessons from the book, and this dimension of my Hindi language study became energized by another gratifying dimension."
2,Disappointed,"I thought Seawolf was a good read until the Captain (with a significant lack of balls) allows his boat to be captured, with no resistance, and does nothing while it is towed backward all the way to China. Gimmie a break! (I would have put a couple of torpedoes down the stern tubes). At that point it all went downhill to a very dissatifactory ending. We are set up to know that Linus collaborated with his interrogators, but this never comes out. The press is amazingly cooperative and uninvestigative. The crew doesn't leak news of torture and Linus' complicity. Too much unblievable ploting, too many loose ends and an ending that doesn't work. I don't think I will read the next one by this author."
1,Read something else,"USS SEAWOLF intends to be an exciting novel about submarine warfare. All it achieves, though, is to put some stupid, lame Chinese ( who talk and act like the Americans, but are only 5 ft tall and wear thick, horn-rimmed glasses - so much for cultural empathy) against swearing, brave Americans. Don't read this book if you don't consider the frequent use of ""heh heh heh"" and ""whaddyamean"" to be literature. Don't read this book if you don't feel like saluting when Robinson declares that the underlying stratum of goodness in Reagan's foreign policy renders all disobedience of the law irrelevant. Don't read this book if you don't like grotesque attempts at tragedy (We're gonna get your son back out, Mr. President, I promise!). But, most of all, don't read this book if you don't find the subtle, fascistoid morality (Let's sink the Chinese pricks so they can't do whatever they please... after all, they're CHINESE!) funny.Actually, don't read this book, full stop."
2,Close but.........,"Like so many other authors, Mr Robinson has trouble nailing the endings of his books. Too many loose threads were left hanging about; Crockers' suicide?, the presidents son not having his treason revealed, the Chinese C in C... I enjoyed the book, until the last 50 or so pages. Too bad the ending of the book couldn't have been as tight and satisfying as the action in the middle!"
2,Why write about something you know nothing about?,"Potential good plot, but unbeivable dialogue and full of ignorance. Why would anyone write a book about something they know so little about AND fail to do any decent research? Robinson claims he had help from Admiral Woodward. I simply can't believe that. Time after time Robinson shows his ignorance--he seems to think subs only outside source of info is periscope, that the Chinese don't have satellite ship surveillance, that two F/A-18s were ready ""in case it's engine didn't start."" he doesn't even know that the Officer of the Deck is a job all the officers share, and isn't a position such as Naviagotor, Ops Officer, etc.I once threw a book about B-52s over the side of a sailboat in mid-ocean because the writer was so ill informed. I surely would have done the same with this book if it hadn't been a Kindle edition."
4,USS Seawolf,"Patrick Robinson is a solid storyteller and his books are hard to put down. His latest novel, gets a bit childish in his writing about Admiral Morgan, however, it is a wonderful book that I highly recommend"
1,Ignore this book,"I have read numerous submarine novels by authors such as Tom Clancy and Michael DiMercurio. Their books are far better than this. USS Seawolf is one big cliche. First of all, the characters are all one dimensional. The Chinese are portrayed as the evil supervillains, while the Americans are all red blooded patriots. The plot is simplistic. Plus, Robinson's writing style is mediocre at best. His descriptions are good (possibly the only good thing about this book) but his dialogue is sub-par. If you want a good naval novel, read Hunt for Red October, or Phoenix Sub Zero (by Michael DiMercurio). Just not USS Seawolf."
2,A weak effort,"Okay, so I'm English but I have enjoyed the previous novels and was looking forward to this one. Now I don't mind a military novel if it is well written and the characters are believable, but this novel fails in many areas. The US Navy are too Hawkish and the SEALS are invincible superheroes (and how nice that three SAS soldiers are un-necessarily involved to make us Brits feel better) and the US President is portrayed as a rather pathetic individual rather then the leader of the free world! The writing is oddly stilted and I suppose the ending was supposed to have a twist, but in reality it was rushed and did not feel right. Mr Robinson has proved that he has in in him to write good navy novels and I hope he gets back on the right track again soon."
1,Horrible...,I am a fan of the techno-thriller. Sub novels in particular. I picked this brick off the shelf and decided to give it a whirl. Guess what? It kept whirlling all the way to the trash heap. The characters are shallow. The plot is unrealistic. The cliches are abound. I can go on but I would digress.If you are looking for a truly good SUB novel try Attack Of The Seawolf by Michael DiMercurio. In my opinion the best SUB-Novelist in the biz.
3,Thought ...,"I just read Jonathan L Lewis's book, ""I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY: Lessons My Wife Taught Me on the Road to Divorce"". I wish I had read it first. I needed to heal the agonizing pain of my ex's affair before trying to gain an academic perspective - and maybe then I could have rescued myself sooner. Ah well ..."
5,Homeschooling High School: Planning Ahead for College Admission,"I purchased this book, which was recommended by a home schooling mom, as a resource to refer other home schoolers to. I have not read it as yet myself. I am a consultant to our mission board's MK parents."
5,Couldn't Put This Book Down!,"THE VAMPIRE'S KISS will send chills down your spine and have you reading long into the night to finish it. I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. There are mysteries and danger around every corner. William gives new meaning to the phrase dark and mysterious and has a sensual attitude that will curl your toes. Savannah is the strong willed and determined woman intent on capturing her brother's killer, who's ruined her life, and will stop at nothing until the man she has been searching for is dead. Savannah and William together are dynamite, and set out to find a killer before he kills again. With many twists and turns, and suspenseful moments, this book will have you wondering whats going to happen next. This is the first book I have read by Cynthia Eden, her writing style was very enjoyable, and she had me wanting more! I will definitely be on the lookout for more of her books in the future!"
4,Great Toy,I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and it was easy to put together. She really likes playing with this kitchen set and all of the dishes. My daughter likes being in the kitchen with me and that is why I bought this for her. I looked at all of the kitchen sets that they had on this website and other websites and I like this one best. Overall it is a great little toy and it folds so it does not take up a lot of space.
4,It's ok,I just got this for my 23month old twin boys. Price was higher than I expected. I bought the pasta set and breakfast set to go with it. Not happy about those prices either. I really would have liked it better if maybe the microwave made noise or the coffee pot. I don't really think it is really worth the money. And I am in the process of replacing the washer and dryer sound machine. Did I mention I got it 2 weeks ago.
4,A new look at the use of new technology,"The author does an excellent job of pointing out the opportunities that today's technology offers companies, retail and business to business, alike. He also makes a strong case for ""either you go with the technology or fall by the wayside."" Today's buyers will not wait. They have become used to the Amazon.com way of doing business and expect it no matter from whom they are buying. Before saying ""yeah, I already know that."" read the book and find out what you don't know. He has several eye openers in there."
2,Let Me Down,"I read the entire book and came away with no new insight, as contrasted with what I have found in other HBS Press books. The material is surprisingly pedestrian! The bottom line is that if you are not investing for real-time operations, you should be because of the changing technology landscape. If you did not know that already, or you do not know that speedy response to customers is important, then perhaps the book will be of some value to you. For me, there was not one thing in there that has not already been covered extensively elsewhere, sometimes a long time ago. I agree with the writer from India."
2,Would not buy another...,We have had one of these for several months and already looking for a replacement. The coffee maker has several weaknesses:1) The carafe is specially designed for the coffee maker. You can't replace it with an off the shelf one when you break it.2) We broke our first carafe and this second carafe cracked yesterday.3) The carafe does not pour well. It often dribbles.4) It is difficult to pour water into the machice. There is a 1 inch ring at the edge where you can add the water. The dribbling carafe compounds the problem.
2,Disappointed,"I like the Ben K Green from Wild Cow Tales and 1000 Miles of Mustangin' (one of my favorite books) - funny, low key, and highly descriptive of people and experiences. This book just follows him from call to call, solving mysteries and lacking (for the most part) the sense of humor evidenced in his other books. The Village Horse Doctor reads like Ben is Quincy M.E. without the ""charm."""
5,Ahh..,"Sing to me. I can't get Belfry out of my head. You Lone JustiCe rider. A woman against the world is what this sounds like. Holy Shiite Batman..I think I want to own the world and take up much of the darkness with my love. I wonder if Sarolta has this. It might be good..(Wink..)I love this. The tiny woman with the big guitars and voice and drums and heart. Kind of like a Tom Petty ""Southern Plantation"" kind of album. Don't come around here no more..Love to those freakin rockers and Maria who saved my lifE tonight if I have a crises! Love..Ahh..Is it a strong enough expression? I wanted to buy a poetry book. But I just wanted inspiration. And here it is..""Inspiration""'s the song that put Maria on aN undeniable sacred place in the hearts of the loving life changers of ths worlD!"
1,Exhausting!,"Calculus textbooks read easier than this book. The content is probably concise but the communication is not. The writing is awkward and often incoherent.Whatever happen to the simplistic yet skillful writing style of a Hemingway? His style was neither haughty nor indolent. He did not have to impress with fancy wordage. And his simplistic, flowing style took far more effort and thought than the rudimentary level of stringing out difficult sentences.This book is okay for the intellectual or the elitist but for the real world it can be painful. Architects are not always known for their communication skills. This book does'nt help."
5,Ethernet Cable performs as such,"There isn't too much to write home about this cable. And that's a good thing, because that just means it works as advertised."
5,corporate creativity is a must read book for all managers,Robinson and Stern do an unbelievable job of telling about creativity in the work place. This book makes you understand that creative acts are unplanned and can come from anyone in the company. The six elements of creativity all make perfect sense once you read this book. This book breakes down the kaizen system and really shows it's effectivness.
1,What happened to his voice???,"This has got to be his worst album. When you first hear it (if you have any of his previous work), your asking yourself if it's really Raulín. His voice sounds awful! Could it be from the wear and tear of bringing out a cd every year? All I know is that if you are a fan of Mr. Rosendo, think twice before buying this cd. If you can, listen to a few tracks first, trust me, you'll be disappointed..."
3,Deep or shallow...,"A road trip from France to Mecca, with a petulant teenage son driving his devout Muslim father lacks depth.Does the son really learn any lessons from this trip?Does the father find solace?There were many times I wanted to reach through the screen and smack the son, so does that mean it is a good movie or does it mean that the character was overdone - I get the picture... The son and the father are from different worlds, but it could have been done more creatively and with more depth.I wanted to feel the father more... I wanted to feel his sickness... His pain at having a son that wasn't a practicing muslim... Why? Yes, silence speaks volumes at the right times... But most of the movie???Watch it for the journey..."
3,Jury is out on this vacuum,Panasonic makes vacuums for kenmore which get rave reviews from consumer reports. That is what attracted me to this vacuum.prospickup is good.panasonic 'name'Customer service is courteous - even if not able to help.consThe belt snapped on the third use.cheap feel to vacuum.cord is not easy to manage which my significant other hates.no accessories (but that is known up front)This looks like a blow out or 'beta' model as it's not longer listed onthe panasonic website so buyer is most likely inheriting the glitches.My prior Eureka boss lasted over a year with no belt or pickup problems at only $30 more. Good alternative vacuum if priced at the $100 or less mark.The jury is out on this vacuum.
1,Don't Make this Mistake!,"This TV, and ALL wide-screen projection TV's must be watched in wide-screen mode or you risk burning out the picture tube at HUGE costs to you. This is NOT covered by warranty. 90% of what you watch will NOT be in wide-screen format. If you put a regular TV show in wide-screen, the picture is distorted. If you watch in 4:3 mode, you will burn out the tube. Ours burned out in 1 year at avg 5 hours of use per WEEK, NOT DAY! Panasonic will do NOTHING to help you out. Best-Buy did not warn us of this problem and in fact, said it was fine to watch in 4:3 mode. Do yourself a favor - until more shows are broadcast in widescreen, get a standard TV."
4,Dance DVD,"I loved the 3 routines on this DVD. At first I was skeptical cause I've never really felt like I get a good work out following other dance videos.. But these routines are different, they really get your heart rate up and you feel the burn in your buns, thighs and core which is great. They're also fun routines to learn.. My only problem is that I would've liked there to be more routines on the DVD. At least 6 would have been better.."
2,Not for non-sailors,"I'm halfway through this book. I loved ""A Voyage for Madmen"" by Peter Nichols, but this book reads like a shopping list. (Then I did this, then I did that....) I honestly don't know what he's describing half the time because the nautical terms mean nothing to me. It isn't a gripping account, even though the man endured some incredible hardships and dangers. His round the world sail was an amazing adventure, but that doesn't make for amazing reading in any way."
3,"Decent, but not enough detail for us","This book was decent, but it could have been much better. It is not very big considering it is covering a very large destination, and they could have devoted much more detail to some of the rural areas of Crete. We spent most of our time in the Plakias and Spili areas which we loved. This book only had 1.5 pages of information about this area, and there were many things in these areas that the book should have covered in more detail. I am sure the same can be said for other areas as well. Perhaps an additional 100 pages would help to give the detail lacking in some of the areas. Having said all of that, it was the best of the three Crete travel guides that we purchased. I would recommend it based on that but with the caveat that it should have been better."
5,Very Informative for New -to-IEP process parents,"I used this while preparing for my autistic son's transition to kindergarten IEP meeting. I feel that it provides a good base on the things parents need to concentrate on to ensure their child is getting the most of his/her education. Though each state has different guidelines, the templates in this book are a very valuable resource to draw from and I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the IEP process better."
3,Award Winner??? This kitchen has horrible electronics sound and the fit and finish needs a quite bit of work,"I bought this product for my twenty month old Son and I am disappointed with it. First of all, the pieces came VERY DIRTY; I had to scrub them before I put it together. I feel like I bought a USED product. The assembly was easy, but unfortunately, the refrigerator door and the oven door do not close completely. In addition, the electronics sounds are confusing and hard to understand the words. All responses are generated turning the stove knobs and the phone is just decoration.I have always admiring Little Tikes for their great toys and quality but this kitchen needs lot improvements and It should cost half of the price ..."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter and she hardly played with it. The sound is so low you can hardly hear it, the door kept coming open and the oven space was non existence and the door was hard to close. For a Little Tikes product I was disappointed, especially for the price of $80. I returned it after one week and purchased a different kitchen product. My daughter is much happier with her new kitchen."
5,My thoughts,"This video is an interesting and enjoyable one-man show by Red Steagall. Steagall is the official Cowboy Poet of Texas, and is a singer, songwriter and poet of the American West. A great film with a homey, visiting-with-a-friend kind of feel."
2,Shakycam,"Interesting topic marred by amateurish hand-held camerawork and jarring jump cuts, which make this documentary hard to watch. There's probably more professionally made films about alternative Egyptology out there."
5,Great Doc,It was great to see the whole documentary without any interuptions or waiting for the next veiwing time. The content and videoagraphy was excellent as was the areas and fields that they explored.
5,"Finally, a different perspective of the Pyramids","This is a fascinating subject and finally someone has produced a documentary on the pyramids with a new point of view, and one that sheds much light on the most likely highly erroneous stance of conventional Egyptologists. I highly recommend this video if you are looking for answers that are closer to the truth than the current, widely accepted mumbo jumbo Egyptian officials would have you believe."
3,Formula,"""Under cover of darkness"" was disappointing after reading his other books. Although the tension begins to build at the beginning of the book, the plot melts into a tired formula--serial murderer, cult-driven, etc. etc. Seattle locales are well-described and provide an interesting setting, but they aren't enough to sustain interest and tension throughout the book."
5,Prime Rib Reading,"What a great find for me. I have always read by authors, if I read a good one the next probably is as good. Well, I certainly will be reading more of Mr. Grippando's. I loved the way the switch was made from serial killers to cult activity. The ending was not anticipated either, but that was just a add on to a extremly well written book. Will certainly read more."
4,Enjoyably.,"But not as compelling and well written has his previous novels. I'd still recommend, because it is an interesting story."
2,Under Cover of Darkness,"Grippando has a knack for writing suspenseful scenes,but his novel ""Under Cover of Darkness"" has too many flawsto merit recommendation.The characters are inconsistent and the plot just plaindoesn't work. In fact, this one reads like a first draft of anovel and is badly in need of major editing.Grippando has some talent as a writer, but badly need to betaken in hand by a good editor.I'm feeling charitable today, otherwise I might have giventhis one only a single star."
3,"The screw holes came off while fixing,otherwise looks good,it is relatively smaller than I thought.","The screw holes came off while fixing,otherwise looks good,it is relatively smaller than I thought."
5,Should Be Mandatory Viewing,"This is a very sobering movie with an outstanding cast of characters. Rather than just generalize what happened during WWII, you see video of the concentration camps showing man at his absolute worst. For those who doubt the Holocaust, or just know of it as something they have read in a history book or over casual conversation: see this movie and never forget. More important, we can't let something like this happen again.Sorry to get on the soapbox, but I do beleive this should be mandatory viewing in our high schools."
5,Why not anamorphic?,"I cannot add to what has been said about this masterpiece. My question is, why isn't this film, like many other great films, released in an anamorphic version, so those of us who have 16X9 TVs can fully appreciate the film's visual images. Other films like this include Nixon, Kundun, The Last Emperor, etc. I could go on and on. Wide screen TVs are the future, they are even "" now."" So why aren't all DVD releases in this format? No one knows...."
4,A Really Cute Book!,"My 2 year old enjoys watching ""Little Bill"" on Nick so SHE actually picked this book out herself! The illustrations are just as they are on the show and the story is really cute! I recommend this one for anyone whose children like the series!"
4,Wonderful,This is a great book for getting some insight into these wonderful women of the bible. Francine did a fabulous job of bringing these women to life.
2,"Disappointing book, lot of errors, insuficient information.","The bad surprise of this book is a lot of errors like typographical, wrong named or wrong wrote corners of circuits (more than a half at Interlagos !), some inexact text information, wrong lap record (Monaco 97 in a wet race !).A excess of photos of some cars (Ferrari and Sauber !), and some lacklustre and out of focus photos (start at Spain). Facts flinged at random in the circuits drawings. It is missing a datasheet with a annual summary of the winners, speed, fast lap, pole position; also the former circuits drawings (in small picture) to show the modifications through the years. The beautiful 2 page circuits drawings, some photos of the past and a fair price it is not enough to avoid the disappointment with this book, which it is not in the same high level of the other books of the celebrated author."
5,WORE MY FINGERS OUT TURNING THE PAGES,"This book ROCKS honey. There are characters you love and those you love to hate. Its one of those books you worry and think about long after youve finished. Better than the ""Yah Yah Sisterhood"" which its been compared to.Go read it girlfriends!"
5,Crazy is a good thing!,"I was given this book by a friend and was skeptical when I began reading it....right up until about 1 paragraph into the book! I was captured from then on and could NOT stop reading it until I knew what had happened to Ms Gussie, Dorothy, Clancy Jane, Violet, Bitsy, and Queenie! It is the kind of book that just draws you in from the very start. A tale of strength, courage, and a little bit of insanity....isn't that what all we Southern girls are made of anyway!? :)"
3,A great beach book,"I found this book entertaining and thoroughly readable but, unfortunately, felt that the characters and story lacked depth. I wouldn't steer people away from it if they enjoy stories of the 'ya ya' genre but if, like myself, you have limited free time to read, there are much better options out there. Basically, it is a great summer, light reading option."
5,The best one of the series!!!,"I, of course, have enjoyed every one of Lori Wick's books thus far, but I must say that this is the best of the Californian's series...I loved how tender and gentle Alex was to Marc. In fact, I enjoyed the second half of the book so much that I had to finish it, even though it meant staying up way past my bedtime!!!Lori Wick can take the subject of intimacy and make it so SWEET...I just LOVE how she does it! She certainly has a talent for this romance...There were several places I enjoyed so much. I enjoyed seeing Rigg in a fatherly role towards Marceal. And I, too, was pronouncing her name with a soft 'C'...Again, this is a MUST read! It is a very sweet, romantic book!"
4,"A Breath Holder, Gruesome, Very Gruesome",I really like Philip Margolin's books and this one was nerve racking until almost the very end. Many reviews have been writtn so all I wanted to say that I found the ending of the story very very horrific. Even a killer deserves to be treated better.
1,"Predictable, poorly written, and a corny sex scene","Like all the others, I had figured out that Cardoni was not guilty by page 100. Of course, I admit I had to go back and reread the beginning pages, but it was pretty clear that the author had taken giant steps to keep any refernce to him off the page when the murderous events were taking place. Unfortunately, no one really cares whether Cardoni is innocent or not. Margolin's main character is a woman, and like most male writers, he lacks the facility to tell the story from the female viewpoint. Most of the characters are cardboard, and the moment the sex scene came up, I said, she's sleeping with the enemy [and hasn't that one been done to death?]. Save your time and efforts. Read something by Robert K. Tanenbaum."
3,THIS IS PHILLIP MARGOLIN???,"I was very surprised at this book, not because of the suspense, but because the past books by Margolin have been excellent and this one seems like an imposter. The characters were poorly developed and somewhat unrealistic, the murderer was easy to pick out early on, the suspect was obviously not the one, and the whole book was a great disappointment."
2,"Oh, Puh-leeze!","I've enjoyed Phillip Margolin's books in the past, having read all of them. This one was so formulaic that if you didn't figure it out within the first 50 pages, you really need to get out more. I could tell you the exact page I said ""Oh, no..."", but that would just ruin it for others. I would definitely recommend this book be skipped and another, better plotted book be read in its stead. The two stars are because Mr. Margolin's writing didn't insult my intelligence."
5,Kelly's review,"This is a page turning thriller, where right until the end, Philip Margolin leaves you wondering ""who dunnit?"" As with all of his other books, Margolin introduces you to characters at the beginning, and continues to teach you about them as the book moves on. His details of the characters makes you think you know them, but in the true sense of a thriller, what do you really know? This is a great book and you will not be disappointed."
4,Excellent effort and worth a look.,This was the first Margolin story I have read and I was thrilled with it. Top notch suspense with plenty of twists and turns. I like a story that keeps you guessing for as long as possible. Margolin does as excellent job with his structure and his character development. I look forward to reading more from this great author.
4,Pedictable,I found this book enjoyable and entertaining but I also found it to be pretty predictable. That was disappointing. I've read all of Phillip Margolin books and for the most part found them to be excellent reads.
5,A great book!,I couldn't put this book down and couldn't seem to turn the pages fast enough! Way to go you can't miss this one!
2,Unremarkable but entertaining,"This book was mildly entertaining at best. I read through to the end because I wanted to find out ""whodunit"" but overall it's a disappointing read. The author's path to the conclusion is convoluted and clumsy...it's a real stretch! And the violence is gory and gratuitous. It was a quick, easy read and more entertaining than a magazine or most TV shows."
2,wild justice,Very predictable. I had the murderer figured out in the first third of the book but kept reading because I wanted to prove myself wrong. Unfortunately I had it pegged.
2,Predictable to the point of boredom,"You know it's a bad sign when the only thing that keeps you interested in a murder mystery is hoping someone else is going to die soon. Margolin is a talented writer, but I guessed who the killer was *very* early on, and so none of the suspense worked after that. Definitely not up to the standard of some of his other novels."
5,Sound Doctrine,"This book was written by a man who is well versed in his field. This should be the handbook for all law enforcement officers to use when it comes to tactics. If more law enforcement officers were familar with the basics described in this book, lives could be saved."
4,Sound Doctrine: A Tactical Primer,"This is a must read, not just for law enforcement, but for anyone that needs to think quickly on their feet. It explains the need for advanced planning, and why it results in a better finished product."
5,Excellent Book,This is a very informative and helpful book for those looking to expand their understanding of sex and their personal experiences with sex. Glad I purchased it.
2,Unbridled narcissism in an arctic setting. ?Spiritual?,"I could not agree more with every word of Isha Beharim's review. My first impression at the beginning of the book was of the author's extreme self absorbtion, and the impression never left me, and the self absorbtion never left the author either, despite whatever ""spiritual"" experience he may have had. The book, by the way, never comes within a country mile of anything even remotely spiritual, and I think perhaps the word was used in the sub-title only to improve sales, although, who knows, maybe sadly this sort of stuff passes for spirituality for this guy.The book was only interesting as the most extreme example of this sort of narcissist-meets-survival writing, which seems all the rage these days, and which also seems increasingly boring to me. I believe this book has cured me of my interest in this entire genre, and for that I suppose I owe a debt of gratitude."
1,This book is missing pages,The book is missing all pages prior to page 27. Not really acceptable to not be able to read the beginning of the book.
4,An exciting and beautiful arctic sailing adventure,"This story is about a couple who set off to explore the Arctic in their sailboat.I enjoyed the author's narrative style and how he keeps the book fast paced and interesting by going back and forth in time. He gives detail in his writing but never to the point of boredom. He is honest and forthright about his challenges, mistakes and regrets. A truly interesting well-written book which allowed me to feel that I was exploring with him since the pictures he painted with his words were so vivid.A book I would read again.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list. I am an avid reader of true adventure and/or survival stories."
5,Read the book,"I Really thinked this book was DA'BOMB (By the way this is a 11 year old girl,And DA'BOMB means :It is the coolest.) Well, I read it with my class last year,And this year i read with my class Jaguer,And When it comes out i am going to read SaQUASH by myself though. And then i will read the Rest Of Roland Smiths Books when they come Out. Signed, Jessie Kelly Ms elli's class . Mrs. Washington is the teacher next door from my classroom. Bye,Roland Smith I will tell Mrs. Washington You said Hi."
4,Solid,"Its ill wind that Sonny Clark's heart stopped after only 31 years, fortunately he left us a few records such as Dial ""S"" For Sonny. Every musician on the album (Art Farmer (t), Curtis Fuller (tbn), Hank Mobley (ts), Sonny (pno), Wilbur Ware (b), and Louis Hayes (d)) controls a fire that burns a single flame entirely. Four out of the six tunes are Sonny's and all are solid. In the liner notes Sonny is quoted ""Jazz is Jazz wherever it's played.""...they played in Hackensack, NJ and they swung."
1,Stupid game for PSP,"this game is pretty one dimensional you follow some guide around the jungle or desert or wherever you happen to be and wait for some animal to attack you. After that you shoot them 2-3 times, WOW. The occasional helicopter or truck shootem'up while in a getaway is an extremely feeble attempt to make this game exciting. Yes short review but it says it all, I wouldn't rent this game let alone buy it.Looking at it a little different a good one for kids"
1,DANGER: Almost killed my dog!,"I am highly recommending you DO NOT give your dog Greenies. My German Shepherd was given one by a friend. He loved the taste and ate it wholeheartedly. However, within a 24 hours, he was vomiting blood and taken to the vet's emergency clinic. Not only did the product tear up his throat, but he had an intestinal blockage because the Greenie did not digest easily. He was at risk for emergency surgery, but my vet was able to help him pass it. He had to be on an IV for a week. Folks, the packaging on Greenies even says it is fatal if not thoroughly chewed. DO NOT RISK IT! I almost lost my best friend."
4,RIP Kirsty MacColl,"The NY Times reported Dec. 19, 2000, that Kirsty MacColl died in Mexico today. I'm really bummed. I bought two of her CDs several years ago and really enjoyed them. Her rendition of the Smiths' """"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby'' was terrific. She'll sorely be missed."
5,Beautiful coral knockoff.,"This bracelet looks like real coral stone. It has a toggle clasp and looks very elegant. Great for accessorizing without looking too flashy. Be careful with sizes though, if your wrist is bigger than 7 inches streching it (it does stretch a bit) might break it."
4,Just finished reading...,"I just finished reading this book last night and I enjoyed it. Since I read alot, friends ask me for recommendations because they only have time to pick up a ""really good book."" This is not a book I would recommend to an occasional reader who wanted something really good to pass their time. Otherwise, for you who read a lot, it might be worthwhile, especially if you are a fan of this writer."
2,Not as good as her others....,"This wasn't a bad book...it is light, fluffy reading and clearly aims to be along the same lines as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" in that it addresses racial issues in the southern 1960's. It simply wasn't as engaging or as deep as her other books. This one focuses on a teen and does seem more of a young adult book than anything else. It was very easy reading....and I expected more from one of my favorite authors.....for a much more satisfying take on this same era, read Downtown by this author...that was the first book of hers that I read, and it is wonderful...a novel that transports you to another place in time...unlike this one."
3,Disappointing for such a good author,"After reading Outer Banks, Downtown, and The Colony, I couldn't wait to sink myself into this author's normally brilliant characterization and depth of story. After the first few chapters, I too began looking for a Young Adult label on the book spine. The characters all seemed a little too shallow and overblown at the same time. Rather like bad actors in a high school play - no one was quite believable. Its difficult to be objective about a single book when you know what the author is capable of doing. Frankly, the book would have rated a two star review except for the fact that it was mercifully short and a rather fluffy but uninspired way to spend an afternoon."
1,Self-absorbed twaddle (negative stars),"If what you're looking for is a personal philosophy that will allow you to rationalize selfishness as ""being true to yourself"", then this is the book for you.It's frightening how many of the reviews I've read here seem to whole-heartedly embrace this horrid, destructive message as empowering.And for those of you who would say that the poem is beautiful but the message behind it is not worth reading, I would say the poem IS the message, and the message is gobbledygook."
3,NEW! BUT NO DUST JACKET!!??,"not very happy with the purchase. it was to be a gift, so i bought it like NEW to save a few bucks, but it came without a dust jacket! that is hardly 'like new'! it's more like 'in good shape. missing dust jacket'"
4,Very funny,"I don't have the first season but I definitely think this is a very funny and delightfully goofy season. And because there's no time travel, it's not as confusing as the third season. :-p"
1,Didn't work for red wine stain,"I used Spot Shot to clean a red wine stain on the beige carpet of my apartment after a house party. It didn't do a thing (nor did other specialized cleaning agents, like Wine Away). I then bought Oxi Clean Carpet Stain Remover and it accomplished the miracle that Spot Shot promised by didn't deliver. I say skip this and buy Oxi Clean."
1,What a pile of rubbish,"Don't buy this card. Or anything from LSI.This card would fail (the driver would crash) if you do anything involving high disk throughput. Copy a 40 mb file from another machine across the LAN? The computer this card is installed in would bluescreen.LSI customer support sent me a couple of BIOS updates and drivers that basically rendered my computer completely unable to boot. One of the largest wastes of money I've had in a while, especially considering the multiple evenings I've spent trying to fix this thing.Buyer beware."
3,A Few Good Arrangements,"For me this anthology has very few good, creative arrangements...Don't Get Around Much Anymore, Take Five, Linus and Lucy,and Pink Panther to mention a few. Coincidentally, none of the more interesting arrangements were by Tom Roed. However, just a few acceptable arrangements for me are ""par for the course"" in most collections.John"
5,Great Early Material!,"The FRC is alive and well at Quakertown, PA, and is known as the ""Beverly Hall Corporation"". Their esoteric technique is very old,unique, serious, and effective for alchemical change to occur within the individual. It is a ""Hard School"" and not for the weak willed person. ""Rose Cross College"" features some early foundation concepts by the founder of this school. Very good, and quite unique, it reminds one of Camelot and the Knightly Virtues."
4,classic tv show..violent for it's time,I remember watching this show on CBS saturday night...pretty violent for it's time....got all 7 volumes on DVD ....watching this again brings back memories...pretty mild for today's TV shows....one of the 1st TV shows to a hire a black woman as a supporting cast membertoo bad they don't make TV shows like this and mission impossible anymore.
1,Piece of junk,"This drill was the biggest piece of crap I've ever owned. It quit working within a few months. The batteries didn't hold their charge. Overall, a major waste of money, except it was a gift.Do yourself a favor, buy a DeWalt/Porter-Cable/Milwaukee."
3,Looks fake!,"My first impression was like is not original brand, because it has not double inside, but I like the price and the size, is perfect mommy purse!"
1,horible,i wasted my money on this? the songs were badly written and none of them make any sense. were was the youthful energy like their old song life in a dangerous time? he sounds uninspired and i am officially done with cutting crew!
3,"She really is the ""Max Perkins"" of children's literature.","Ursula seemed to know EVERYBODY. While this book is a fascinating look at some of the ""big name"" writers of children's literature, I really was hoping for more biographical data to accompany the letters. It was a frustrating reading experience at times. Ursula seemed to be ""treading on ice"" when she wrote letters to E. B. White and Laura Ingalls Wilder, but totally free and breezy (and perhaps bordering on rude at times) when writing to other authors. I was puzzled from time to time at the complete changes in Ursula's tone . . . and I am more curious than ever about Louise Fitzhugh, writer of ""Harriet The Spy."" Something went wrong in Louise's life after writing ""Harriet,"" but there are few clues in this book to explain what happened. Ursula apparently took some of her most interesting knowledge to the grave; I wish I knew more."
2,"Can you say ""sap""?","This book will appeal to readers who like things light and sappy, but a mature reader will probably find it a waste of time. The plot is ridiculous. The characters are likable, but not complex enough. We are supposed to believe Patty Jane is this wise soul who should be a model to us all, but Patty Jane is as silly as the rest of the characters. Read the Cape Ann if your interested in a light read, but with depth to the characters."
3,A hopeful screenplay?,"I got the feeling the author was hoping this book would be turned into a screenplay/movie rather than touching the human spirit like most books do. I totally understood her motivation when I read that Landvik was an actress herself. Too bad, Landvik is exploring her career at others' expense. I would say this book is well written, but I would not suggest it to anyone whose thinking was past a 10th grade education."
5,Wonderful,"The CD is wonderful. No, chips or scratches on the cover or the CD itself. Love the songs on the CD."
2,"Nice glasses, but they are huge",You can hold this in both hands and your finger will only overlap a little. 18 oz's is a LOT of water.
5,Well worth reading,This story should be more well known than it is. John Harper was a model Christian as he demonstrated a very strong faith especially while the Titanic sank.
