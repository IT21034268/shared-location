5,A Must Read for All Dog People!,"In each of her stories, Margot Woods has captured the essence of the human-dog relationship, and the importance of good training in enhancing that relationship. Her stories depict everything from the frustration both handler and dog exhibit when there is no training and hence, no communication between the species to the amazingly strong bond that is forged with proper training and communication. Everyone who has a ""problem"" dog should read this book for insight. Everyone who has a ""good"" dog should read this book to see how much better their dog can be. And, for those few people who have the kind of relationship with their dog that Ms Woods helps her students achieve, reading this book will have you nodding your head in understanding, laughing in delight and shedding the occasional tear. A must read for all dog lovers, whether pet owner or professional trainer."
1,Costly Mistake,"When I received my copy of ""The Piano Teacher"" I realized I ordered the right title but by the wrong author. When I saw it was written by a Nobel Prize winner I thought I might be in for a pleasant suprise. It was a most unpleasant suprise and I'm not talking just about the explict sexual content. A writer is suppose to vary her sentence structure but reading Elfriede Jelinek is like listening to someone who talks on and on and on.. without pausing for breath. It's exausting. Andwho cares about Erika the repressed 38-year-old piano teacher, the lover half her age or her overbearing mother. They are dull. This novel is set in Vienna. Unfortunately it's not in the time of Sigmund Freud. Jelinek could have sent her characters right to his couch instead of inflicting their angst on her readers."
1,Worst book ever,This book was the current month's selection by a book club I belong to. This is without a doubt the WORST book I have ever read. It's pure trash. I'm just grateful I checked the book out of the library rather than waste money purchasing it. Too bad I couldn't give this book a negative star rating!
3,German & English,"I read this book both in English and in German (original language). For all of the excitement that I heard surrounding it, I found the book to be a disappointment. Though Jelinek is an absolutely brilliant writer, I did not care for her style. There are only 3 places in the book where she uses quotation marks to set off spoken quotes of characters. The book seems like one long run on sentence. As a graduate student of comparative literature, this was wonderful material. I do appreciate her literary techniques and the symbolism employed throughout the book. As an academic read, this was a great book. For pleasure reading...not so great. In english it is an awkward read with a weird flow. It is definitely obvious that it was not originally written in English."
1,Terrible Reading,"This book was hard to get through and lost my reading pleasure. It was way too bloody and very hard to track events through. Not an entertaining book and not worth the money. Needed more than just the ""skinning and hurtful"" ways of the people included with the story telling. Something was totally missing in this story. Donated to our local library as I did not enjoy it at all."
4,"Best ""unplugged"" CD I've ever heard,plus new songs,too","This an excellent release from the post Ronnie Van Zant band. Every version of old tunes are done very well. It's cool stuff! The new songs are all good songs,not to be ignored.I saw Skynyrd in Dallas come out on stage and basically do this whole album,sitting in chairs, with acoustic instruments. It was stunning...They walked off stage,saying ""give us a bit,we'll be back"". They then came back and played a very long amplified set,including ""Coming Home"",""Curtis Leow"", and ""Down South Jukin'"", again. It was nearly 3 hours of musical bliss!By accident, I saw this Endagered Species CD in a music store the next day,and knew I had to have it.I still have it, and YOU need to get yourself one too.Buy it!"
2,Business Card Creator,"This product turned out to perform poorly. I do not recommend it. However, I do recommend the seller who shipped promptly and shipped the exact product advertised and which I ordered."
4,A pleasant surprise...,"I bought this CD because I was intrigued...and I wasn't disappointed. After giving it a few listens, I would characterize it thusly: Imagine Dream Theater getting together with the horn section from Oingo Boingo and playing covers of early King Crimson songs, with Mike Oldfield making an occasional appearance on guitar. (I know, that's hard to imagine...you'll just have to buy it!) I think there's a lot of potential here; I definitely like what I hear enough to make me want to buy the full-lenth album when it comes out."
4,Not a bad effort!,"This band is tight, devoted and imaginative. The arrangements aren't bad, but need a little more dynamic range (everybody seems to be playing all the time, which is a creativity mistake a lot of rock bands and composers make). Obviously influenced (and I mean this as a compliment) by bands like ELP, King Crimson, Uncle Frank (Zappa...lol...) and possibly even more obscure bands like Tin Huey, Zoltabrane gives it a good shot and is off to a great start. Contrary to some of these other ""reviews,"" this cd is NOT a waste of money--on the contrary, it's a refreshing breath of relief to 90% of the current unimaginative corporate garbage out there today. I commend them for their courage, and I say this cd is well worth the gamble."
5,GREAT!,"I got this cd for a carnival-circus party for my Daughter,You'll feel like in the Circus!The 28 themesare one better than the other,I 'm really pleased with this purchase."
4,great product!,Bought for my small dog. She has allergies. Cone fits perfectly. I did take of the push buttons because they were a little hard to close and replaced with industrial strenght velcro. Easy on easy off. My dog does not mind at all. No more banging into walls and she can see throught the plastic.I would have given it 5 stars if the closure was velcro rather than push buttons.
4,I dragged eight books to the beach; this is the one I read.,"The characters in ""Crucifixion"" share an experience that changes, in ways great or small, their lives forever. The book reminds me of a 60's, hippie-ish, Vietnam era ""The Sun Also Rises."" We meet the two main characters when they're young, relatively innocent, and living in Mexico, and meet them again fifteen or so years later. Everyone who was in his twenties during that time period will see himself in at least one of the characters."
3,"Okay for the little ones, provided they go slow","You won't be doing any tricks on this skateboard... my son can walk faster than it will roll.. but that my loosen up with time and use. What disappointed me was the shoddy quality of the pads and helmate that came with it. The elbow and knee pads are thin with no actual padding, they are simply a plastic shell that velcros on. This will protect against road burn, but not broken limbs. The helmet is a farce. Cheap flexible plastic wrapped over some foam that straps on. One trip into the mailbox and the helmet will be shattered.If you are buying for anyone older than 5, you will want to buy actual pads and a helmet to go with it. The skateboard itself is fine and worth the price asked, just don't count on the pads that come with it."
4,Great skateboard set for beginners,"I purchased this set for my son's 5th birthday. It was a great price for the board plus all the safety gear (helmet, knee and elbow pad, and wrist guards). My son really liked it. The pads are small, perfect for a 5-6 year old. The helmet is a little large, but still stays on his head fine when the straps are tightened down. I am happy with the quality of the pads and board, but the helmet is pretty cheaply made. But for the price, the helmet is sufficient.I don't think my son will be good at skateboarding for a long time, but he likes to play with it. The biggest advantage is that he can use the pads and helmet on his bike and scooter too!"
4,"Great value skateboard, and it looks cool.","My son really loves his Spiderman skateboard. I, as a parent, love the fact that it includes a helmet, wrist guards, knee pads, and elbow pads. The safety equipment all has Spidey graphics as well, so he likes to wear them. The bearings are a little stiff, they may roll better once they're broken in. If not, I will replace them. All in all, a good board for the money."
4,Very nice beginner set,"Bought for my 8 year old. Nice, bright and colorful. Strudy board, though padding could be better. Would recommend. _"
5,Great Product,"I was skeptical about this product. My son loves it only a lot! As a father, I love the fact it came with safety gear. IT is easy for him to wear and He loves wearing it."
5,the true revolutionary music since nirvana,ok im a huge 311 fan even though i first listened to them like 6 months ago. i have almost all of their records including their newest cd from chaos. if your a rock fan this cd rocks. since 311 isnt well known you wont be stuck listening to the radio singles but the entire album. grassroots is wonderful and its a jewel for 311 hardcore fans.
5,Just the best,"Definately 311's finest example of catchy tunes, tight rhymes and wicked riffs. You can find it all on this cd: reggae, rap, alternative, and it's all good! 311 is just the greatest band. Period."
5,"For fans who ""get it"", this album is pure 311 bliss!","As an avid 311 fan from way back, I often wonder which of their albums deserves to be called my favorite. I don't think there is such an animal... but as far as the most constant, track 1 to track 14 enjoyment, Grassroots takes the cake. The five geniuses of the band take you from catchy rock (just TRY getting Homebrew out of your head!) to mellow, always melodic sublimity. Silliness abounds in Offbeat Bear Ass, as does their peace and freedom vibe. Omaha Stylee is perhaps the perfect 311 song... an upbeat musical journey that begins with an amazing little hook. Listen to 1,2,3 when you're feeling a little rueful and need a dose of optimism. The title track and Applied Science are both evidence of Nick Hexum's brilliance, and SA Martinez really struts his stuff in Nutsymtom. New 311 fans, pick this album up! You will be glad you did!"
3,Solid 311,"This is a solid effort by 311. It keeps consistent with their same style and mixes punk, rock, and rap in with some reggae in for good measure. I still only give it 3 stars though because it doesn't sound fresh at all. Their excellent ""blue"" album would breathe a nice shot of life into the band. But this effort just doesn't do much for me.Not saying it isn't a worthy buy. Because it is worth adding to your collection. All I'm saying here is, I'm not blown away by any means. Solid 3 stars."
1,Stopped working after little use,"I bought this scale at Target in August 2007 and withing 6 months the scale had stopped providing its digital readout. I assumed that the battery had gone dead, so I bought a new battery for about $5. That was a waste of money, because it had no effect. I read now that others have had the same experience. Don't buy this scale! I recommend going with the tried and true analog types."
2,Garbage - You Get What You Pay For,"This product is terrible and works intermittently. Generally can be accurate, but takes 2-3+ attempts to get a reading. Recycled in trash after only a few months of useage."
4,Decent,"Pros: big readout, sturdy feel, no cheap looking, plus a Kg/Lb switch on the back.Cons: not water resistant enough for the bathroom. Mine went dead after a large amount of water was accidentally poured over.Accuracy: decent. I once was so bored that I put standard weights on the scale to test its accuracy. The error went as much as 1lb but I suppose that is tolerable to most people."
1,Waste of money,I bought this scale and it is a waste of money. You get varying readings by 10 pounds every time you step on it.
1,Will not work more than a few weeks,"I bought this item and in a few weeks it stopped working. It completely stopped showing the weight on the reader.It was OK while it lasted. Readings are not highly non consistent. At 11:34PM I will be 170 lbs and 11:35PM I will be 173 :). Go for something better, Please"
2,Sole Problem,This item is not meant for people with the shoe size of 9 or more. It is hard to balance yourself on this thing. Our feet hang over the top and sides. I will be investing in another scale real soon.
1,Scale,"Price was the main reason a purchased this item. Do you get what you pay for? However I find it to be unreliable, weight could vary significaly, depending where you placed the scale. And this is a flat, solid, smooth tile type surface.Very unhappy"
2,It has got beauty but has no brains,"The weight from Taylor has excellent looks. Infact it seems like a portal that is gonna take you to mysterious places. The only thing is that it doesn't work that well. It is really unreliable, sometimes off the mark by huge margins, by any standard. For the first week it showed me consistently that I was weighting 142 pounds. And then suddenly I was 146 one day and 142 the next day. I tried to check it one day and took 10 continous readings. It gave me 3 sets of reading varying from 138 to 146 pounds. So overall the product just gives you a range and not actually gives the accurate weight. But what more can you expect with that price. You cannot buy the moon with 15 dollars can you."
4,"Good, good, okay, and good.",Sometimes it goes on the fritz and flashes 12:00 -- maybe it's an identity crisis? I've taken time out of my day to just sit with the scale in a quiet room and reassure it that it's a great scale and doesn't need to be something else to fell fulfilled. It's getting better.
2,Disappointing,I am a huge Barbara Kingsolver fan and have read all of her other books. But I just couldn't get past even the first essay in the book. I am sure it is just a different style of writing--essay versus novel. People who usually like essays may like it. But to me it was just a lot of prattling about nothing in particular. Give me a plot!
3,Thought they were velcro.........:-(,I ordered this product because I make large cakes and thought bigger strips would be extremely helpful. I had actually bought a set of bake strips once that were attached by velcro and LOVED THEM! When searching for these I used the keywords VELCRO EVEN BAKE STRIPS. It pulled up the large strips as an option. The description was a little confusing and I was very disappointed when I received my large bake stips and they had to be pinned together. The strips work fine but the pinning is very cumbersome and time consuming. I did see a suggestion on another post that said to used large safety pins instead of the straight pins. Helpful.....but not as helpful as velcro!!!
5,N'Dour returned to his roots for inspiration.,"NOTHING'S IN VAIN is again a reaction in the opposite direction, focusing on traditional roots and including a lovely balafon cut, vocals, and hot beats. It's obvious N'Dour returned to his roots for inspiration and came back with an album which surpasses many or most of his prior publications."
3,Not what it's chalked up to be,"I bought and returned this laser to a local retailer. It's self leveling, but it's really cheap. First, it only self-levels in level mode, not in plumb mode. Second, when it's in level mode and spinning, the line tends to ""bounce"", unless your shooting the laser less than 10 feet or so. Not really sure why, but it's tough to tell which point is level and which point is the bounce. I learned the hard way, but you're better better off biting the bullet and just spending the extra couple of hundred dollars for a nice unit... it makes all the difference in the world."
1,Leaks,"I have a half-size refrigerator, so must store things on their side. Bought 4 of these items to hold water, ice tea, etc. Two of the four leak: leak to where I have to pull everything off shelf & mop up. 2 of the 4 do not have solid seals, they leak but do not create a small pond. Bought these at over 5 bucks each to replace 50 cent containers bought in Thailand 7 years ago that leak a little. The Thai ones are going back in the fridge. Guess I'll have to use these for dry goods. I spent extra on Rubbermaid as thought the name implied quality. These might work fine in an upright fashion, but so what? Certainly can't throw it in a knapsack, or put in the backseat of a car, let alone store on their side. Have double checked to ensure I screwed tight, etc., so no chance of user error. Waste of almost 25 bucks."
2,A well chosen album title,"I was desperately looking through the internet for a tango ""happy birthday"" and the tune was there, in this album. After I purchased the cd, I read the booklet included and there I found mentioned that ""the album's title is not merely a reference to the popular tune, but a celebration of the ensemble's anniversary"". So, I was happy to have finally found a tango ""happy birthday"" but I was also disappointed because this was not the playful album I was looking forward to listen to.But this is a bit unfair for this excellent orchestra.If what you are looking for is innovations on the romantic classicals... well this could be it. The point is that this is an album for listeners who know their way into classical music.Other than that I should suggest that innovation regarding any classical music ""playful"" album would be to capture the listener's interest with more daring ways than that."
4,Thought-Provoking Wisdom of the Ages,"""A Thousand Paths to Wisdom"" certainly delivers in terms of quantity and quality. This is a great coffee table book that is designed quite well. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because most of the quotes in the book are not referenced. Two sections of the book, ""Famous Voices"" and ""Ancient Wisdom,"" include quotes and its source. There are other referenced quotes scattered throughout the text but not consistently. I do feel it is a great resource in exploring your own path to wisdom."
4,A Piece Of Essential 311,"Simply put, this album is one that put 311 on the map for many in 1996, a year after it was released, when the singles ""Down"" and ""All Mixed Up"" went into heavy rotation. The album, as a whole, provides the listener with a straightforward taste of the 311 sound. The songs are tight, easily digestable, and with the exception of ""Purpose"" and ""Sweet"", faster paced and distortion heavy. This album is a very easy one to put on and play through. The two previously mentioned songs are not to be overlooked - both are a prime example of the band's ablility to blend reggae flavors with their own version of rock. Throughout the album, every member carries their own weight - S.A.'s vocals on ""Random"", Nick's clever wordplay in ""Sweet"" along with Tim's gut-wrenching solo, P-Nut's bass riff on the chorus of ""Don't Stay Home"" and as always, Chad Sexton never fails to amaze with his propensity for drumming. All in all a very enjoyable straightforward rocker."
4,On To Buy List?,"Though I would actually give this cd a 3.6, pickiness would not give me that chance. I originally purchased this cheap. Dirt cheap if you will. I was turned on by ""Down"" and ""All Mixed Up,"" I was pleased to find my purchase more than worthwhile. Though not every track is the greatest thing ever created, the record as a whole holds the perfect blend of rap and rock, which never appealed to me personally. Unfortunately, this was the only 311 cd that clicked with me.So what makes this cd so great?1 - Down3 - Jackolantern's Weather4 - All Mixed Up11 - Don't Stay Home14 - T & P ComboAt least one of these songs would appeal to most anyone, and thus could lead to further enjoyment. So why not kick back, and think further into 311."
3,im cool you arent,"when i got this cd i got only for the songs i heard on the radio so when i started listening to it i realized the only good songs were the ones played on the radio. i also have 311 Music, and Grassroots, and this is much better than both of those."
4,Good Album but not as good as the previous ones,"THis album was a little different than Music and Grassroots but it was still pretty good. My favorite songs off this album were DLMD, and Hive."
3,no comment... nothing special really,"Seriously though... This isn't the best. And let's face it, it really isn't anything special. 'sides ""Down,"" I felt they could have worked a little harder to create more memorable songs to go with the lyrics. The only song that I'll really remember here is ""Down,"" and maybe ""Jackolantern's Weather,"" and that's disappointing. I'll admit some of the songs did come a bit close, but I still give it a 6. I hate to say it... but I also felt like I was listening to the same song over and over in a few. The words changed... that was a good thing."
3,Return of the Musketeers,"A real disappointment - 3 stars only because of the indestructible charisma of Oliver Reed and the high production values. What the screenwriter and director forgot is CHARACTER -no dialogue ever creates an impression of personality that isn't based on the assumption that the viewer has seen the first two films. Dialogue is atrociously simplistic, and Cattrall's fencing simply not up to par. Michael York's narration is unnecessary and an example of the screenwriter's laziness. Wasted opportunity, and a real shame."
5,"""Practical and Easy to Follow""","From Jan Nathan of Publisher's Marketing Association (PMA)-- ""Marisa presents useful, inexpensive, easy-to-follow steps for publishers seeking media attention in D'Vari's energetic, breezy and upbeat style. A fun read, as well as presenting practical info."" --"
5,"Cogent, practical, accessible, & ""user friendly""","In Media Magic: Profit & Promote With Free Media Placement, experienced media consultant Marisa D'Vari shares her years of expertise in this 145 page instructional compendium packed with ""tips, tricks and techniques"" for finding and utilizing the radio and television to promote services and products. Marisa's advice is cogent, practical, accessible, ""user friendly"", and constitutes an entire ""how to"" course on everything from developing an effective media kit to securing radio interviews and television appearances.

2,Read like a balance sheet,"Richard Power does a wonderful job of name-dropping through the entire book. Instead of presenting the interesting stories of cybercrime, all you get are dry facts and figures about how much money you're wasting by not protecting you network. Most of the figures are unsubstantiated and presented out of context - they have been plucked from a yearly survey conducted by Power.If you want to read about digital crime/security then I recommend Bruce Schneier's ""Secret's and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World"" or Steven Levy's ""Crypto : How the Code Rebels Beat the Government - Saving Privacy in the Digital Age."""
2,Tangled ... as in a plate of spagetti,"True to its title, this book is something of a tangle of news stories about information security breaches back to the Morris Worm. If you want a history book with reasonably succinct info about most of the major US infosec news stories, this is for you. If, however, you're looking for some deeper analysis, maybe something on trends and updates (i.e. after the news headlines have died down, what happened to the victim companies?), or anything much outside of the US, I wouldn't bother.... END"
5,Want to know what will save us from global warming?,"If you want to know more than even the scientific profession knows about cold fusion, read this book. As a result you will be up to date about one of the most important discoveries of this century. This book continues the line of books that reveal a discovery that will change the way we live, yet has been broadly rejected. Discover how science behaves when it is confronted by a novel idea and how many of the problems created by conventional technology will be solved."
1,this is not the vol 1 i'm familiar with.,this is a poorly put together vol. 1. i have played vol. 1 at least 20 times and this is not it. the vol. 1 i know starts out w/ the wonderful music and anna madrigal watering her plants on the patio first thing in the morning. i feel dupped in rec'g this version. i don't recognize most of it and dislike it intensly.i feel so upset i'd like my money back. i think you're selling this dishonestly.
2,Helmet and pads,I was not too pleased with the item itself. The helmet came apart not long after it was received. The pads were okay though.
1,Disappointed,This product comes with 2 kneepads and 2 elbow pads. However the knee pads are too small for a toddler to use as they are basically the same size as the elbow pads. Very disappointed.
5,A winner for your little handy man (or gal),"My 4 year old loves this toy and measures everything all over the house. It is great fun for him and for mom to use as a ""keep them occupied"" activity. The item came in blue and not the red of the picture. I don't recall reading that the color may vary, but it could have been there in the description. Either color is fine and didn't matter at all to our guy."
4,Great product.,I love this it makes it very easy to put a design into your woodwork and gives you an nice easy way to make something semi original completely original. my only complaint is that the instructions are just a piece of paper nothing special so why do I need to go online to get a few more design ideas. This is a huge inconvenience I do not like to take my computer out to the shop with me. The other complaint is there are only design ideas for two of the four templates granted the other two do not need much of an imagination but it would still be nice to see a few ideas instead of having to try and figure them out.Overall I think this is an extremely nice and easy to use product that would have received 5 of 5 stars if not for the design instruction inconveniences.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who want to take the next step in woodworking.
2,What a train wreck!,"Hate to join the chorus of neigh-sayers, but jeeeez! I have to agree that with the exception of a few cuts (such as ""Hyphenated Harriet"") Mandy is a vocal bull in a china shop -- what he doesn't shatter he ... on. What should have been a tribute (I love Sondheim, but do we need ANOTHER anthology recording of oft sung songs?)is more like a wake. Mandy seems intent on becoming the male Ethel Merman -- if you can't hold the note, belt it out with a misplaced vabrato and maybe no one will notice. I REALLY wanted to like this recording, but is truly horrible. If the pipes are gone, Mandy, I hope you get back to acting."
3,"""Free phone?"" I think not","I am not really going to review the phone but my intent is to inform others about another ""review"" on this phone.There is a review of this phone below that says you can get an unlocked phone for free. That is misleading... To get the ""free"" RAZR, you must answer a lenghty survey, and then subscribe to certain offers that you choose from. I got all the way to the end of the survey, having selected trial offers of tooth whitening strips, Blockbuster Online, Columbia House video, and cosmetique makeup. Certainly I would be able to subscribe to those and then cancel my subscription. On the last page, I was required to choose 4 offers, but they all cost way too much. I quit at that point because I have no need for home wine delivery, foreclosure listings, or the like."
2,Bad choice,"I bought the Razr thinking it was awesome! Oh how I wish i would have looked into more!The phone is incredibly slow, to the point I am disconnecting calls left and right because I dont think the call even got answered because it takes so long to pop up. While texting, I usually have to wait 10-15 seconds to let it catch up to what I typed, then go back and fix the predictive text errors (but i guess thats with all phones?)The other day the phone started freaking out on me. It kept hitting the number 8, then star, then the ""text message menu button"", and it was so fast I couldnt use my phone for anything. Even when I took the battery out and back in, it still did it. Then it stopped. The next day it did it again.I am taking it back today because its a terrible phone. Also, if you are a student and want to be discreet about text messaging, its impossible with this phone."
2,Ok it's pink but that's all!,"I had this phone for a little over a year when the screen went bad, within the next few days the sound went as well so now I am suck paying the $50 deductible for my ""new"" refurbished phone that cingular (now at&t) insurance is sending me. I have never dropped this phone and i am even a light user (i only do like 700 minutes a month) so i would not recommend this for anyone who plans on their phone lasting more than a year. Oh and this happened to two other RAZR V3s that my boyfriend had as well."
2,Too Boring!,"I love a good formulaic read, but this one is too boring! The characters spend most of the book congratulating one another on how very clever they both are whilst the reader yawns and wishes they would prove it rather than say it. There are a few clever lines, but for my money I would go with Amanda Quick's Ravished, which has very similar, but far more interesting and dynamic characters."
3,so-so......,"I didn't pick up this book with any expectations. I picked it because the back sounded intresting and I needed a good novel. I managed to read it in one night. The book was alright but it could have been a lot better if the author paid attention to a few more details. The plot was quite quirky though and I liked the fact that the heroine wore glasses. It's the first romance I've read where either of the couple needs glasses. It adds a touch of reality to the story and it helped a lot. I also found myself laughing aloud at some of the select parts, particulary at Prudence."
3,Dangerous...,"This has the most annoying heroine I've read in a romance novel. I had a hard time finishing this book co'z of her. She started off sweet and shy and lovable but towards the end, she turns out to a manipulative, controlling, annoying...uggh, it's a wonder sebastian can tolerate her, she just gets on my nerve. Anyway, this won't be my last A. Quick book though. I really liked her ""Ravished"" novel. Perhaps you should try that first."
1,Bad and Boring!!!!,This book of Amanda Quick was soo boring. The hero's family kept on insulting the heroine but she never fought back. All she did was listen and listen!!!! I'm a women and if somebody insulted me in such ways i would surely go crazy!!!!But our Charming and utterly stupid heroine just stud there and never fought back. Miss Quick has never done such a poor job and i'm totally chargained by her bad work!!! I'm still a big fan of Miss Quick but i request please don't write such type of novels in the future. It pains me to read about how badly women were treated and people actually write about the heroines being treated that way!!! I hope i dont read this kind of story setting in the future!!
2,Not that great,"I got this and immediately returned it. I didn't realize from the web description that it is made out of plastic and gives a cheap, chrome-like appearance. Because of the way it is made, the skulls come off as gaudy--but that's just me. I can see this mirror in one of those monster trucks--you know, the kind you have to use a step ladder to get into."
4,A Slugland Thriller!,"This is a silly, suspenseful saga penned in tongue-twisting poetry about pride coming before a fall, ignoring neighborly warnings & slithering up a slippery slope into the maw of destiny. Some Smug Slug is super with riveting illustrations! Very well done!"
4,Yeeeeeeee Haw!!!,"Season 6 is the first full season with Bo and Luke after they returned to the show. The entire original cast is here, including Enos who returned in the 5th season. Lulu also stars in more episodes during this season. Some very memorable episodes aired this season, including ""Targets: Daisy and Lulu"", ""Undercover Dukes"" and ""Cooters Confession"". Look for the General Lee's jumps to appear higher and more unrealistic at times. This is because around this time Warner Brothers started to use minatures to film some of the jump scenes. This was one of the better seasons they filmed, right behind the first two seasons which are the best ever."
1,IE & .NET are showstoppers for this product,"Thanks to the user who pointed out that this pen product requires Internet Explorer and .NET framework. Like that user, I have misgivings about both of these add-ons to Windows, and won't install them on my machine. As a result, I can't use this pen.Too bad. It sounds like a useful tool for my work, but it's not worth the security exposure that it comes with."
2,not something you carry in your pocket,It works fine. Recognition foftware works fine. You will be happy untill...1. You realize that you need digital paper TM that cost a lot of money. They rip you off on consumables.2. You bring it to work and see the reaction of your colleagues (male and female). It is too big for a pen. It's design and size is way too risque and resemble a... Here is the kicker - it vibrates when you make a check mark (finish page). After you see the looks when they hear that...
1,Crappy shipping,"The one star rating is for Amazon and NOT the product. Like one of the reviews below I am having problems getting this item shipped. Took me a week of calling everyday to get a refund. It was in stock when I ordered and has been in the shipping soon status for 2 weeks.Don't bother ordering this prodcut, but instead order the seperate pieces. Currently you can order the rails, mounting base, and the LS incremental positioner (upgrade to the TSIII) for 375$. And OMG they shipped the same day if I order the parts seperate and not as the out of stock package."
3,Updated: Pricing still only $3 less than the bow AND arrows.,"Revised ReviewThey have lowered the price, but I would still probably buy the bow and arrows for only $3 more. Again, this is a great toy, and will not fall apart as easily as a couple of other reviewers state.Original review when price was higher:You can buy the original box AND three arrows for less than just the three arrows offered here.I disagree that the arrows are not durable. I have been using them for weeks and they still work fine."
4,blues-rock at it's best,"I've been listening to Ian Moore and going to his shows for 3 years and he's one of the best to come out of Austin in a few years. This album combines good, rocking guitar with soulful and heartfelt vocals to give you some music you won't easily put back in its case."
2,hard to get some wine bottles in and out,"It seems to function largely as I expected it to, except for two things:1. I had to conduct an experiment with a thermometer to figure out whether the ""Min"" and ""Max"" on the dial meant ""maximum cooling"" or ""maximum temperature"". I think Min is the warmest, and Max is the coldest.2. Wine bottles vary in thickness a bit. (For example, a typical Pinot Noir bottle is a little wider than a typical Cabernet Sauvignon bottle.) The spaces for wine bottles are a bit small for getting the wider ones in and out, and I probably couldn't fit a bunch of the wider ones near each other. So it can hold 12 narrow bottles fine, but not 12 wider ones."
4,Self-made man's public autobiography,"A well written and extremely entertaining autobiography of Dick Mackey who won the Iditarod Race in 1978 by a second. In some ways, the book almost read like the history of Iditarod and as the founder of Coldfoot, Mackey probably won his place in Alaska history. I regards this more like public autobiography because Mackey mostly relates to his public life. What seem to be missing are stuff about his personal life outside of few mentions of his kids and his three wives. It would be bit more interesting to know the man behind his accomplishments and the cost.But overall, I highly recommended this book about an extraordinary Alaskan who did extraordinary things. As a fellow Alaskan, I hope there will be more chapters to come."
3,Mackey Attacks,"Mackey sums it all up: "" People who are content to stand still irritate me. I feel the same way about people in every profession... always try to improve your work... try to be the best you can be.""This is a record of accomplishments of one man who came from New Hamphshire. He was a young, successful entrepreur until an accident changed his life...bankruptcy. He was young, married and a father. He lost it all... but not for long. "" I knew nothing about Alaska, but it was as far as I could drive.""Alaska is a better place for men like Mackey. He has left his mark as a Iditarod Hall of Fame. The founder of Coldfoot, AK.and the list goes on and on.Mackey, you brag a lot... but it's not really bragging... you did it."
4,fresh new grooves,"Zen Turtle gets off to a shaky start with a silly little thesis on the relative merits of public spending on space shuttles versus welfare, but after that it turns into a nice groove. Sooth expands the dub n bass genre dramatically into funk, soul, rock and on tracks like ""Can You Dig It"" something completely original. A very original album that should appeal to a wide audience from rappers, rockers and techno enthusiasts."
4,Is this......the best CAKE cd ever?,"I am a huge fan of CAKE, I have all three and the first one I got was Prolonging the Magic, and then went backwards from there. Once you hit this album, you truly have to appreciate the music, and be a huge fan of this band. The sound is a little undefined, they seem to still be in the process of finding their trademark sound. Several of my friends that are CAKE fans really aren't because if you don't love every aspect of CAKE, then you aren't a huge fan."
2,Asleep at the switch . .,"I love this band, but who produced this record? It's not low-fi - it's zero-fi. The tunes sound like they could be great if someone just put a little bass, drums, and guitar behind them.Or maybe I got a bum copy . . .This could be a 4 or 5 star CD w/ good sound."
3,Has the potential to be so good,"This novel could be so great. Great premise. End of the world. Ship full of survivors. The narrative is great. And with all of that, it just didn't deliver. At least not to me. There were a lot of directions the author could have gone with this and he really didn't do that much with it. And the end... Not really a decent ending. I wonder if Mr. Brinkley just ran out of ideas. Regardless, it won't leave you satisfied as a few other reviewers have mentioned..."
1,Piss poor book,"I only give this book one star though I wish I could have rated it as a negative star! This book with its turgid and slow writing was not unfortunately, the worst end of the world book I've read, but it rates very high on that chart. The book was boring and the sub plots, if not silly, did nothing to enhance the story. A post nuclear war novel set against the survivers of on a Navy destroyer and the struggle to come to grips with this new world. It is of course a modern ship complete with suitable quota of women. The author seems to know his tech and the Fleet but thats where it ends...Techno babble cannot carry a story this bad tho the idea was interesting enough to attract my attention and my misspent dollars...Stay away, even at a dollar or less, it is not worth it..."
2,A very wordy and intricate examination of one man's soul,"The premise of this book is most interesting and presents ample opportunity for examination of issues most will never confront but many consider. Unfortunately the author contents himself with the microscopic examinaion of the motivations behind each and every word or shoulder shrug of every character in the book. I must confess to finally putting this book in the ""later when it's raining"" pile after nearly 275 pages. By that point, I found it more work than it was worth to find out how it ended."
2,Engaging story but tedious delivery,"The reviews registered here cover the gamut and I can agree with thoughts from those who loved the book and also those who despise it. I sometimes felt I was witnessing Brinkley's attempts at writing the world's longest sentence. This book should have been closer to 300 pages in length as it is bloated with tedious descriptions and subconscious ramblings. At certain points, once I had learned to recognize the beginning of another long Brinkley exercise in over-description or introspection, I simply skipped over it to the next line of dialogue and really didn't miss anything. He needed a tough-love editor. Read his book 'Peeper,' it's better."
4,Foam build up at last.,"This book has one of the best explainations of the foam build up technique for puppet fabrication that I have seen. Lots of photos and a good section on material suppliers. The book also covers the foam injection method in the same detail with lots of photos. If you are building stop motion puppets, this book is a must for your collection."
5,Perfect,This is a great book for big and small who enjoy learning about rocks. It has great pictures! ! !
1,Songs are short??,"I bought this album for ""Sweet Victory"" but it is only HALF the song! Why not put the entire song if you are going to create an album?!! Doesn't make sense to me."
5,Spongebob again!,"what is there to say? It is spongebob! Downloaded this to my kid's mp3 player. I love some Spongebob, but do get tired of hearing it over and over......."
4,Fobus Holster for Sigma 40ve,"This holster is freaking awesome! It's exactly as described and perfectly ""snaps"" around the trigger guard for my Sigma 40ve.Pros:Good quality buildPerfect fitPaddle Mechanism is awesomeStance is goodCons:I don't like the fact that you cannotdepress the magazine releasewhile in the holster easily._________________________________Other than this, I think that thisholster is great. It's not ideal forconcealed carry, but it's great forthe range or open carry (unlessyou wear baggy shirts or ""hoodies."""
5,Lewis Miller: Sketches and Chronicles,I purchased this book as a gift for my husband. He was very pleased with it and all the information it contained.
2,Great until they shrunk,"Please be advised, they do shrink. Mine were great for the week until I left them in the car during a bike ride. I went to slip them on afterward (post-bike being a main reason for the purchase) and they were tight. I assumed my feet had swelled until I noticed they were still snug and short the next day. Still refusing to believe it, I went to a store to try some on again. Sure enough, it wasn't in my head. They had shrunk more than 1 croc size (I was borderline XL/XXL and my XXLs were now smaller than the XLs).To make a long story short, I think there should have been a warning on the label. I don't think it's an obvious assumption that beach sandals will shrink dramatically in the sun/heat. I would have taken more care in these conditions."
3,shrinkage temporary and not so temporary,"I loved these clogs because they were so comfortable. I wore them outside and left them by the door because they were muddy, then they shrunk a size, but after a wash and time inside they were a wearable size again. So I thought, OK, don't leave them outside, but I forgot. Same thing happened but they were tight after that. The fifth time I spaced out and left them outside, they were at least 2 sizes too small for good. I tried to cool them off and waited weeks, but they are permanently shrunken. All that said, I am still thinking about getting a pair to wear around the house because they are so comfortable. So if you can afford to replace them I recommend them."
3,Acceptable at $40.,This comforter looks and feels nice but was thinner and lighter than I expected. Don't think it will be warm enough by itself for winter. Acceptable at 40 dollars but should not pay more than that.
2,no mounting screws or instructions,This is a lovely mailbox however it arrived with no instructions or mounting hardware. How do you install it?
4,cute enough,"I like the original song, so the mixes are okay with me. However, that's it: they're just okay. None makes me shake my butt in my seat. In fact, they all sound a bit too much alike. The B-side ""...in the Dark"" is obviously about sex and is very sex. When they performed it in concert in 1991, the crowd went WILD! The ""Being Boring"" mix is excellent. It's here because it was not a single in the US, unlike in the United Kingdom. Hardcore Petheads may get two copies of this disc because they issued it with different covers."
1,Might have been ok for exam before revision,"I just passed the test today after studying this book. The exam is no longer based on SBS alone, and most questions 60% could not be answered by this book.I did like the style though.It was probably ok for the earlier test."
2,Just took the test....,"I just got back from taking the 70-282 test. I passed, but no thanks to this book. I realize the questions are randomly chosen, but I can not imagine it is pure luck that the vast majority of the questions asked were not covered in this book. The test is 41 questions and I would say about five matched up with what I read in this book. The rest, I had to rely on my experince as a network admin to get through. Even if you memorize every word in this book, you will still fail without much more in-depth knowledge of networking in general, Windows 2003 and Exchange 2003. It is really disapointing that a so-called ""study guide"" turns out to be so irrelevant to the actual test.Bottom line, do not rely solely on this book."
2,all fluff no stuff,First time I have written a book review and I'm doing so because I should have read other reviews before buying this book.This is one of the worst technical books I have ever purchased/read.I bought this book to prepare for my exam not to learn about the smb nation and the business endeavors of the author.The most frustrating part is that at the end of each chapter there is a quiz section which is representative of the questions you would face on the exam. You are supposed to know these answers by osmosis as topics in most of the questions are never even covered in the chapter. It would be helpful if the chapters covered the material that we would be tested on.Sickening (and watch out for the 5 star reviews as these are generally shims)
2,Save your money and look somewhere else,"The book has more typos than you can count. Content is mediocre, based on how some consultants probably did their implementation.. right or wrong! Practice Questions are highly ambiguous, do not follow common principles and almost half the time have wrong answers. They will confuse you more than they will help you. The authors are well known, but having read more than one of their books, it seems more for their networking ability than technical prowess. I strongly recommend to look somewhere else..... and that is a problem. SBS is 3-6 products rolled into one and if Microsoft Exam people want you to fail, it would be so easy for them. My best guess is to prepare from the Help and documentation you can find on MS website."
2,Monopolies Suck,"Well this appears to be the only title availabe for 70-282 exam. It is full of errors-- a 2page error sheet ships with the book and it didn't even catch all the errors. It would make a better website than a book. There is little meat. There are a lot of references to other meaty resources. Needless to say, I think someone could do better. Shame no one has. Unless you want to use this as a syllabus to point you to the meat...skip it."
5,Passed the exam!,"But.. Though i've installed lots of SBS 2003 servers in the last few years, Harry and Beatrice's exam prep guide was the one thing that helped me past those trick questions and most important helped me focus on the right way to read and understand the questions.It also had me thinking a couple of times.. Lot's of tricks specific to SBS that i still used to do manually (Setting up PDA's to sync with Exchange for example).This book is an excellent study help and resorce guide!"
3,Looks good but handles are weak,"I liked the looks of these, because they seem rather unique with the flat edge, but I have found out that the handles are weak and can bend easily."
4,Nice but a bit of a pain,"The cables are of an excellent quality and I am completely satisfied with them. The trouble that I had was with the end cap connector where the cable connects to the electronic ignition controller. The end caps were not seated correctly on the end of the cables and were not easy to place, and then the way the plastic locking clips were designed made it tougher to connect. But all in all I was satisfied with the purchase and would them again."
4,"Overpriced, but nice","I have medium toned skin and bought lovejoy. It has been wonderful. This is a very lightweight make-up so it feels like you are not wearing anything at all. The blush gives a very, very natural look. It doesn't stay on all day, but it makes me glow and feel beautiful.I would buy it again and recommend it."
4,TAOS: A Winner!,"I got a gift certificate to Sephora for $25 and wanted to use it on something I would normally not buy (which is hard to do in Sephora because I want to buy EVERYTHING!!) Anyway....I wanted to try NARS blush, but didn't know which one to pick. I told the salesperson I was trying to streamline my makeup routine, wanted to look natural, but polished. I told her I only want to use mascara, blush, and gloss for my day look and asked her to pick out a natural looking blush. She picked Taos and brushed it on my cheeks....I was running late and had to get back to work, so I got it and left. This morning I used my regular blush brush and immediately had to wipe the blush off--way too much pigment. After removing some, I got the wonderful, natural, blush look I was going for. The blush pulled my face together and even though I was wearing less make-up, I looked polished and professional. Will definately recommend and repurchase!"
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"After reading all the rave reviews, how great the color is etc. I went out to but it and to be honest i hate the color. While the peachy-ish color is nice but nothing special what I hate is the color of the shimmer. It's like a weird goldish color. I regret buying this"
4,Too heavy,"This is really the only complaint I have about this Bible -- it's weight. As a lap-book, it's truly uncomfortable. Taking notes with this Bible on your lap is also uncomfortable. The cover's sharp points dig into the skin. But now I see that this Bible is offered in paperback and lighter-weight versions, so that will solve this problem.This Bible is a wealth of information including word studies, commentary, red lettering for Jesus' words, center-column cross-referencing, maps and charts in color. A massive endeavor to have put together, I commend the editors."
1,NKJ Nelson study bible,"I have only down loaded the sample so far. I have had a leather bound copy that I had rebound several years ago. I really LIKE this as a study Bible but from the sample copy of the Kindle format, I can't tell if the commentary is with it. It is at the bottom of each page in my regular copy. I want to by the Kindle version but need to know if the commentary at the bottom of each page is available."
3,Kindall Edition,Ignor my rating. Does anyone have a comment on the Kindall edition?????????????????? There does seem to be good search qualities on other Kindall viersions I wondor how they are on this version. Thanks
2,Hard to use.,"The kindle edition does not easily go to specific books, chapters, or verses of the Bible. I do not recommend."
1,All Around TERRIBLE,"This company was HORRIBLE to deal with. I emailed them no less than 4 times and NEVER to this day got a response. I called them twice and was frustrated to no end both times. Both times they assured me my package was on its way. Neither time did it show up. When it finally arrived 6 weeks later, I actually tried this makeup and it's horrible. It's a really cheap imitation of Sephora. If you're going to spend the money, go buy Sephora. That make up is amazing. L'oreal and store brands are better than this. Even my teen daughter didn't like it. It's a really bad product."
5,UPLIFTING,"There is a very good reason why I've enjoyed this book so much and that is that I can relate so many of the poems and personal stories to my own life, which is indeed very comforting and uplifting. I'm sure every person that reads it can relate to one thing or another. This author has a wonderful insight into life and is blessed with the ability to put these thoughts into words. Hope she keeps them coming!"
3,Quick N Easy,"Hi Folks,I use this wax all the time IN BETWEEN my regular waxes with a professional Carnauba wax. I find it easy to apply and remove with little effort on my part however, (And you knew there HAD to be a down side) if you are looking for a long lasting shine, as Vinnie would say, ""Forget about it""! All it takes is a good rainstorm and this wax is finito! If you want a fast shine with little effort then go for it, but if you want, a long lasting shine then you are still going to have to go the rout of a good quality Carnauba paste wax.How's that for a smooooooooth review?! (LOL)"
5,Super easy wax job...great shine!,"Just spray it on and wipe it off. So easy! Each time I wash my car, I apply an extra coat of wax. Man, does my car shine (it's black). A friend told me about it and said the same things i am. It's a great product. I've applied several coats now and it's February in Minnesota (a few months since last application) and the shine is as good as when I had just applied the wax!"
4,"Great convenience, good value, lacking features","It's a good value, and extremely portable. However, it takes forever to take pictures using a flash. I have used much better digital cameras where as soon as you press the button, the camera will initiate the picture taking. There is no way to check the status of your battery life, a warning light comes on shortly before the battery dies. Picture quality is good when using highest quality settings, I've printed many pictures and they all turn out great. But beware, this camera is horrible for taking pictures up close, and the zoom is quite lacking. The menu is also not user friendly and the controls can be quite confusing. It's a great, portable camera, but if you want a lot of features, this is not it."
4,"Good camera, but not the best choice","This is a real good camera, but there are butter choices than this. I would consider Canon PowerShot A60 is much better choice than this. It has all the features this one has + it has more optical as well as digital zoon + it's cheaper + we can record video upto 3 min. (it's max. 30 sec. in S200)Also playback on LCD has sound in A60, which is not present in S200.Although disadv. of A60 are bigger size (not that much), it uses AA size batteries, I always prefer Lithium Ion Rechargeable batteries. and it is not yet released ;-)"
4,Good for starters and casual uses,"it's small enough to fit in your pocket. basic functions meet point-n-shoot needs. if you're looking for your first digi-cam, this is it."
3,warning! outdoor pics only,This is a great first digital camera-- but I wish someone would have warned me that you should only use this camera outdoors. I can't for the life of me get autoflash to work and I can't make the flash go on by choice to take pictures. Beautiful outdoor pictures- woudl love to use it indoors- but even in broad daylight in the house the pictures come out dark and I end modifying them with software--If you are planning to buy this camera- beware that indoor pics don't turn out so great- my disposable camera does a better job.
2,work out tape,"The tape was just OK. Not really much of a work out and I thought it would be a ""funk"" work out as in disco music. It ended being yucky funky music. Not worth sending back as it was only [...] so I'll keep it...on the shelf."
2,Only For A Select Few,"I'm a Star Wars fan but I didn't care for this so I can't even say this is for die hard fans. Maybe it's for die hard fans who would like to throw their money away. I found the plot on this very thin with most of the pages devoted to action. The story includes some characters who are ""new"" in the comics but includes some older ones like Bib Fortuna and Wedge Antilles who appeared to act just like any other character. The art was passable but I found the story and writing very lacking. If you want a really good Star Wars graphic novel I would suggest getting Dark Empire."
2,Book of Visual Studio .NET,As a Visual Basic user from many years ago I bought this book to help me get to grips with the daunting IDE that Visual Studio presents. The danger for a new user is missing the fabulous new Wizards and other time saving things that are pre-built into VS but are sometimes tricky to find for the uninitiated.This book discusses .NET in detail but to be fair I knew about .NET's principles before. What I wanted was a guide to USING VISUAL STUDIO. And this is really not it. As an overall handy text for a newbie to .NET it is great but I don't think the title is right.
5,sonia dada - sonia dada,"I am from Boulder Colorado originally, I heard the original Sonia Dada and have been a great fan ever since, even saw them in concert in Boulder at the Kenetics (Great Concert! ). Moved to Texas in 1996 and lost my copy, and I have been searching for a replacement all these years. I am so far behind, I didn't know they have had 3 more releases since then. I must have them all...."
1,Do not try to follow the advice in this book,"This book's arrogant tone is despicable. The contents are without merit, unless you want some pictures of Segovia, or a little bit about the history of the instrument. If you follow the advice on technique, you will never learn to play the guitar."
2,Riddled with Errors,"This book was very frustrating. Just when you think you have written all the code it asked you to, as soon as you run it, it blows up. Well at least I learned to debug from this book. Also , I dont like the way they teach using tools they have included with the book, these are are not tools one would use in the real world. And by the way , dont bother calling or e-mailing there tech support about the errors, they never got back to me. I am still looking for the right book to teach me databse programming."
4,Their Good is Our Excellent,"The reviewer who preceded me here has given some marvelous background for this album, so let me pretty much endorse his judgments regarding the disc. Although I don't consider this one of the Baltimore Consort's best releases, the group's standards are so high and their repertoire is so engaging that even an average outing by this ensemble is very very good by absolute standards. I heartily endorse this release; pick it up with no fear of buyer's remorse."
5,OUTSTANDING,This is the best joke book I have read in years. The author has a terrific sense of humor. Everyone needs to get this book and share it with friends.
1,Does Not Fit!!!,"I bought this for my brother for his birthday, he has a 2001 Ford F150 & it clearly stated that this stick will fit the model, but of course it didnt & is now sitting in storage. Make sure you contact the company before you purchase this. The knob itself is really cool it looks heavy-duty but does not fit most models"
4,Nice Knob,"Purchased this for my '95 Miata. Insert for knob worked fine with my stick and has not loosened after one month and me taking it off several times to fit a shaft so that my boot wouldn't show the remaining stick. (Cut a large spring in half - looks kind of cool)Has good feel and heft. The leather insert is nice to feel, although not really cushioned. So far, no complaints."
5,Outside the fusion range,"This CD is like caviar. You have to listen to it a few times to start really appreciating it. There is 65 minutes of music here to inspire you and challenge your music tastes for years to come. Vocals are seductive, the beat fast and exciting. The complicated music patterns can truly get you hallucinating if you are doing any of the hard stuff. If music came from the future to visit us it would sound something like this."
2,GOOD WHILE IT LAST,"This handle lock was relatively easy to use but it did not last long. It is not a very good quality plastic and my 12 month old was able to pull the handles and in one try brake the lock. My baby is not particulary strong, the lock just didn't handle the everyday use of an adult and the couple of pulls of a 12 month old. It suppose to be able to handle those two things. See my pictue uploaded."
2,Word of Warning,"First off, a word of warning. This movie and the 2008 All Hallows Eve version [...] are EXACTLY the same movie. I guess someone decided to repackage the movie for a new release.Beyond that, this is a low budget indie horror movie. Minimal blood, minimal nudity.All in all, not great, but not that bad. I've paid more to watch worse."
1,Disappointing,"When I watched this DVD I thought it has to be a spoof. The Instructor seemed drunk and rambles through the whole time. The video, edited, set and the sound(Backing alarm sounding)were very poor. The Instructor may have sound technique but is clearly not comfortable in front of a camera. I would not recommend the DVD at the price it is being sold at."
1,WORTHLESS OUTDATED JUNK,"This is the worst piece of garbage I have ever read. It is outdated, useless when it was new, and overall a waste of time and money. I feel sorry for the trees that were used to make the paper for this book. THIS RATES A BIG ZERO."
2,what was Henry Rollins thinking?,"I received this book to review for a zine I write for, and it was so bad i told the publisher it wasn't worth reviewing. pierce was grandiose at best and just plain crazy at the end, and it really shows here in the jumbled structure and absolute inanity of much of what is included. I was pretty grossed out by his attitude toward women, too. His obsession about all things Japanese was also really tedious. And I LIKED the Gun Club. Reading this book made me think of the book & movie ""Being There"", in which the main character speaks only in slogans he's heard from television, and those who meet him think he's a genius. What were you thinking, Henry?"
1,don't waste your money,i purchased this mascara awhile back hoping it was finally going to be the one mascara that actually did what it claims...to be smudgeproof! it was the worst mascara i have ever used! it was smudging all over the place just after 2-3 hrs of wear! i spent all day wiping it from underneath my eyes!do these companies actually test these products????needless to say i should of sent it back for a refund...but i was so frustrated i just threw it in the trash!it only got one star because there wasnt any other option to go lower!
3,Neo soul review,Book gives good ideas but nothing new - recylced old ideas - the author gives too much personal information - good for him that he lost weight but enough already ~!
2,Where's the passion?,For the uninitiated let me just say that my Breitling wristwatch is my most prized possesion. In other words us Breitling collectors are a bit nuts. You'd have to be to spend so much money for a watch when a fifteen dollar quarts digital is all you need to tell time.My feeling is that the author of this book might just as well have been writing about some other collectable such as Snoopy or South Park action figures. I felt that he didn't really have the enthusiam for the subject which is a shame. I'd pay a lot for a really good book on Breitling.
5,Make money with no stress.,"High Profit Candlestick Patterns should be read by anyone who wants to stop losing money trading equities and start making profits without breaking a sweat. Following the guidance clearly laid out in his book traders will more likely find their trading volume increasing because the patterns are clear and pleantiful. Using High Profit as a rulebook, you'll always know why you are entering and when you should be exiting -- more often with profits than losses. Steve successfully takes concepts that most active traders know about and turns them into the kind of trading guidelines that we've all been looking for."
3,Good text,This book was used as a textbook. The book contained detailed descriptions of the brain and how drugs or medications affect it. Good information!
1,Waste of money,"Buy a small plastic heating pad. Wet a towel. Hot compress. Don't put the heat too high, just enough to get the warm moisture into the muscle. The theratherm so called 'moist' heating pad just doesn't do the job. The moisture is supposed to come from your own body. Hot compress is the only way to go. Take your money and get a massage."
4,Great piece of history.,"Saxton Pope gives a great historic account of Ishi, the last wild Indian (native American), from building archery tackle with him to hunting the way his people hunted. Pope goes on to explain, in great detail, the art of making one's bow, string, arrows, points, fletching, nocks, quivers, arm guards, finger tabs, etc. Also included is a explanation of shooting techniques, performance characteristics of various bow-types from around the globe, and hunting stories from various famous archers. This book is a real classic and will especially be a good addition to library of those who are a purest when it comes to archery and hunting."
1,"not a pictured, cheap fake.","Now as pictured. No Nike squish, not even the brand it advertised. Cheap, faded, cotton hat. Cheap quality. Hat came bent and smooshed in box. Looks like something fire a child, not a quilt ."
4,A blast from the past,"Growing up in England Dr Who was a staple part of my television viewing, both as a child and semi adult.The show obviously does not have all the gadgets and animation associated with todays television but the story line is enthralling and the Daleks are the first trully evil space invader experienced on TV.A great show."
5,loved it,"Tarr knowledge of horses and history shine in her fantasy. So far this author has not disappointed me.This book stand alone ,but ""Lady of horses"" ""Daughter of Lir"" (sequel) and ""The Shepherd kings"" enrich this book."
4,Solid writing,"An interesting read, reminiscent of Jean Auel's Earth Children series, Valley of the Horses and The Mammoth Hunters in particular.This book is set somewhere between 6,000-10,000 years ago and shows the clash of matriarchal and patriarchal cultures. It focuses on a handful of characters, though the main characters are a twin brother and sister who are the last of the matriarchal line in their culture. The sister, Sarama, goes west to seek cultures that still treat women with respect. She finds these people and tries to build a life for herself. Her brother finds himself excommunicated from his people and decides to follow his sister to these lands where women rule, goods are plentiful and there is no war.This book starts out quite slowly and it's not a quick read. I've seen a review that says that action doesn't start until about page 200 or so; I think it depends on how you look at ""action"". I enjoyed the slow start to the book because it set the scene quite nicely."
3,Interesting,"A bit wordy in places, but that's the style of the period when it was written. Glad it was free for Kindle. I got it because this took place near where I live. In fact, there is a statue of her in Letchworth State Park, near Mt. Morris, NY."
1,too much interference,"For some reason this product worked fine for a month or so, then we returned it because it would get other people's telephone conversations AND network television! I would be sleeping and wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of a popular late night talk show! I don't know if it is because of a lot of electronic equipment in our home, but this product had to go! It got to the point that every time I would turn it on I would get interference, it was useless."
2,Static....Very Very True,"My wife and I received these as a gift off of our registry. Let me say this, the first night we had our baby home, the batteries went dead in the transmitter!! Not because of the baby crying hard, but because of all the ""short bursts"" of static!! We are only in the next room, and this was more of a nuisance than anything. Maybe it would work better if you were within 5 ft from the baby..Thumbs down"
1,I couldn't hear the baby over the static!,"This monitor was AWFUL. So staticy and loud. I returned it and bought the Evenflo monitor which I LOVE. GO buy that one, it is clear and perfect."
1,most horrible monitor ever!!!,This monitor had so much static it was unbelievable. You could not move the monitor near anything with electricity. I would not recommend this for anyone who wishes to monitor their baby. This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent!!!
1,TERRIBLE,I own 2 monitors. I still use one for my 2 year old. It is made by Fisher Price and is GREAT. This time we wanted one with 2 recievers that didn't cost a fortune and my hubby bought this one. Like others I wish we had read what people had to say about it.The static is awful. It will just start making a very loud white noise sound that will only go away if turned off. Great at 2am when it's the reciever down stairs! Also at times it does NOT pick up the baby. I will be sitting somewhere that I can hear baby and the monitor and I will NOT hear the baby on the monitor. Not good...that's the reason I bought the thing!I am going to contact First Years to see if they will give me a new unit or preferably my money back. Too bad I didn't save the box or I'd return it!
1,Horrible Monitor,I wish I would have read these reviews first. I had this monitor and thought I had a bad one so I exchanged it for another just like it and it has the same issues. The static will drive you nuts!!! It continually looks for a different channel and makes a clicking noise. I spent more time awake listening to all the noise the monitor made while my baby slept. I went in to Babie R Us to get a new monitor and asked a clerk about the monitors and they agreed with me that this one received really bad reviews and did not recommend it. I asked why it was still on the shelves. They said they do listen so hopefully soon it will be gone.
1,So disappointed,I agree with what all of the Moms wrote...this monitor is horrible. There is nothing but noise (that is not my baby)and static. I pick up neighbor's phone calls!!! For the price of this monitor you would think it was a quality product. Needless to say a new monitor is going to be purchased this weekend. What a disappointment!!!!
1,Junk,We got this monitor because my sister in law has this brand and my husband believes they buy good stuff. ...i got the two receivers but one of them continously snaps and pops like everyone else says. The other one is fine. I've only had them a week but have decided i am going to return. My old one was a Fisher Price sounds and lights and i'll stick with that. Dont waste your money.
1,"Horrible, Terrible, Awful Monitor!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY...","Everytime we turn this monitor on all we hear is static. Most of the time I end up turning the monitor off because of the horrible reception. This company should be embarrassed for putting such a horrible product on the market. I am returning it to babiesrus, and I highly suggest people read these reviews before they register or buy any product. If I would have, I would never have bought this monitor."
1,Piece of Garbage,This monitor worked well for the first week but by the second week I wanted to throw it away. The static is horrible. Do not purchase this monitor. I have since ordered a different manufacturer but I haven't received it yet so I don't know if it will be any better or not.
1,STATIC< STATIC< STATIC!!!,The other reviews say it well- All you will hear with this monitor is static.
2,I wanted to throw it out the window!!,"We registered for this monitor because of the 2 receivers. Unfortunately, we had the receivers turned off more than on. The static was unbearable! No matter where the monitor and receivers were positioned in the house, there was constant static. And when the phone rang, forget it. We stopped using our cordless phone thinking that would help....not a chance. After about two weeks we went back to the store and bought a cheaper model. And guess what, it works wonderfully. We can use our cordless phone and not a peep of static. We don't hear telephone conversations either...just our little angel. This monitor system is way too expensive for the amount of aggravation that goes along with it."
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"Between the unbearable static (either channel), which would wake the baby, and being able to hear phone conversations & televisions throughout our neighborhood, this monitor drove us absolutely crazy. Peace Of Mind, my tail. I couldn't return it quickly enough. I got the Sony 27 channel one instead, same price, only one receiver, but much, much better. Don't even consider buying this product. Even one star is rating it too high."
1,Horrible Product,"This baby monitor is the worst thing I bought for my new baby. The feedback was absolutely horrible. There were times when the feedback was constant, and the monitor therefore couldn't be used AT ALL. I wish I had read the on-line reviews before buying this product. It would have saved me the money and aggravation. Buy the Sony 27 channel monitor set instead. It only comes with one receiver (and is more expensive), but it works great. It is very sensitive sound wise and there is very little feedback."
2,VERY SENSITIVE,"This monitor is very senitive!! I have never turned the volume control past ""0"" because it is already so loud on that setting - sometimes, I wish that I could turn it down, especially at night! Otherwise it is an ok monitor. I had an old Fisher Price Monitor that continued to get stuck in the A/B channels and caused a lot of static. After a week, this monitor has begun to give off static, and I am thinking of returning it and searching for another one."
1,Don't waste your time with this one!,"We purchased this set of monitors and wished we hadn't.Pro's:* Comes with two monitoring unitsCon's:* Static is very annoying! The background noise on these is ridiculous! They seem to pick up every type of interference in the area which makes hearing baby very difficult.* Picks up cordless phone conversations all of the time (could be a benefit if you're into that type of thing...)* Even without static or noise, the sound quality on the listening units is average to poor.In a nutshell: DON'T BUY THIS MONITOR! Purchase the Sony Baby Call model, it is very much worth the extra money."
2,Worked great for 8 months ... but then,I had this monitor for 10 months. The first 8 were great but the last 2 have been unbearable. I am actually searching the internet now for a new monitor and I thought I'd share my experience w/ someone else looking for a monitor.I really like the fact that it has 2 receivers and that all units have battery backup. It makes it easy to visit a friend w/o kids. I can just pack the pack and play and throw the monitor and a receiver in the bag and not have to worry about power. (I am now looking for those features in a differnt monitor.)The problem is the static. I keep 1 reciever downstairs and one in our bedroom. This morning my wife brought our son downstairs. She thought I was going to get him but I never heard him. All I heard was static. The monitor is all but useless now.Maybe this monitor would work for someone but it doesn't work for us.
1,Noisy,Tried the monitor for two nights before returning. As others have stated it has a horrible clicking-popping noise about every 15 seconds. If your baby isn't keeping you awake at night this monitor will!
2,STATIC/CLICKING/LOUD CONTINUAL NOISE,"We thought we were paying for a good monitor, but have had problems with regular static, clicking at odd times, and a loud continual noise when the phone rings or when you place a call. Other than that, you can hear every movement and breath the baby takes. I have read reviews on other brands found customers who bought less expensive monitors that work without these problems. As a mother who is trying to get some sleep while keep an ear out for your child the last thing I want to do is battle the monitor to find the ""right"" position for it to function properly.I am trading ours in."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","We purchased this monitor for my sister-in-law and she has been fighting with it every since. The static is terrible, there are no other sounds, JUST STATIC!!! Now we have to go through the trouble of trying to return it and get her another one that will actually give her ""peace of mind."""
1,Do not buy this monitor,"There is so much static with this monitor and I can hear my neighbors phone conversations rather than my baby. I will be taking it back to get another one as soon as possible. The static not only makes it impossible to hear your baby, it is so loud it will wake you up during the night."
1,"I didn't do my homework on this one...DON""T BUY THIS","Wow...I did not do my homework on this product. I figured since it was a higher priced monitor, it would be one of the higher quality monitors. WRONG. I am not a review writer but I was so unhappy with these monitors. They are something that you need from day one when baby comes home, and there is a lot a stress created when they don't work correctly. Tons of static and interference to the point where my husband wanted me to turn it off and just check on the baby...well, most moms would agree that is a not an acceptable solution. Anyway, do yourself a favor, don't use these monitors. Whichever ones you do purchase...test them out for a day or two before the baby comes, because the last thing you want to be doing when baby comes home is worrying about replacing your monitors."
1,Count me in the group that thought this is a waste of money,"Like a lot of the other reviewers, I received this monitor as a gift. I've dealt with the headache for the three weeks that our baby has been home, but I'm going out today to buy another one that WORKS! I would say that it only worked without horrible static about 5-10% of the time. Everything interferes with it - I heard our neighbors' cordless phone conversations more often than I heard our baby! Most of the time, though, it just emits a horribly loud, continuous static. Obviously this is a problem with this product - I wish First Years would either fix the problem or take it off the market. Bottom line: pick ANYTHING but this!"
1,No Service No Corporate Response,"As the other reviewers have stated, the dispenser freezes in the back and does not thaw, nor does the temperature of the dispenser work correctly, mine runs warm even at the highest setting. Although customer service will document your call in Ottawa, their corporate office in New York will not return my call. The three repair numbers customer service gave me did no good as I was also told by one repair person that Haier does not reimburse the repairs and as a result they will not come out to my home. Customer service told me twice that they have recommended to the corporate office to replace my unit, but of the five to six calls I have placed over the past two months, I have not received any calls that any progress or action will be taken. I have been trying to get my dispenser serviced since September."
1,haier beer dispenser,"DON'T BUY ONE!!! the worst customer service! they lie to you and tell you everything is going to be fixed. no response back even after about 10 phone calls over 1 month. Doesn't keep beer cold enough. the electrical plug in to the compressor shorted out and would not work, got the run around from haier customer service,(sounded good, don't believe it.)called the new york coporate office got sorry that's the warranty and will have to pay for the service tech. very dissatisfied with the QUOTE "" BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY ADVERTISE!"" I hope everone boycots haier products."
1,Haier Beer Dispenser,The only reason I rated this product and company as a 1 was zero and negative ratings were not available. The product proved to be defective less than one month after use. Contacting Haier for authorized service was useless. Five of the five authorized service centers Haier provided me with for service said they would have nothing to do with this company. Some shared experiences that can not be documented. Forced to have to troubleshoot the problem myself (after having to refill 2 CO2 tanks within one week) I determined the problem to be a defecitive keg tap. Attempts to get Haier to send this part were useless. Most calls to their corporate offices went unanswered. If I was successful the service was terrible. Never once did they get back to me or respond as promised. This company is by far the worst I have ever dealt with. Their customer service is none terrible. Their products are terrible. I caution anyone not to purchase any product manufactured by Haier.
4,"Get the centering cone, too.","Ditto on the Buchholtz review. You can center this subbase using a bushing and snug fitting bit but the centering cone will make your life easier. It would also be nice if Bosch anticipated this and left more room in the router case for this base.I used my Bosch PR20 Colt router with a P-C 59370 Door Hinge Template. The small base, while very nice for many jobs, does not span the opening in this template. You will want to have either this subbase or the PR009 for template work.I chose the PR010 over the PR009 due to the ready availability of 1-3/16"" bushings and the relatively poor reviews of Bosch's bayonet mount bushing. Milwaukee's bushing kit is fine quality and their service is great."
5,It is what it says it is,"I just got mine via USPS. Mine is dead flat, my bushings fit it, and yes, I will need a centering cone to center it.The only drawbacks to it are:..it will not fit into the case when attached to the base..The hole in the middle is smaller than the original hole...The fence will not fit the base with it in place without cutting a chunk out of itNone of these are a drawback, unless you plan to leave the base on full time to give the router a larger footprint."
5,Great CD,"This cd rocks It goes back to the grass roots of 311. With songs like Jupiter,Running and Rub a Dub this cd is perfect for any teenager. So thats why I give this cd 5 stars."
3,chsmt@voyager.net,"The cd is alright with songs like ""Beautiful Disaster"" and ""Galaxy"", but still it does not live up to the 311 name. Still major 311 fans will still want to look into this one, but rap fans should steer clear."
5,the best CD by 311,"I've gotten in and out of this band so many times, but with their new song ""Amber"", which is so awesome words can't describe it, I am back into them again. This is still in my opinion, their best album. It has a feel to it that you will not find in any other 311 album but it still has the signature 311 sound. The best thing about this album is that it has 21 songs, therefore making it possible for the band to exercise their many styles in a plentiful amount which they do so well. Standout songs on here are tracks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 20, and 21. There are a few songs on here that could have been better such as ""Light Years"", ""Strangers"", ""Rub A Dub"", and ""Running"". I don't care for those much. Still a great album."
4,Great CD,The music is different than the stuff that i usually listen to but it was overall a pretty good cd. One of the great things about it is that it is HDCD encoded so it sounded really awesome on my setup.
3,Not too good but better than the usual 311,This was the first 311 CD that i ever bought. Its not too great but holds good songs like Beautiful Disaster and Galaxy. I bought Grassroots a little later and found that the style was way different in Transistor. I like Transistor better. Its not just rambling and guitars like Grassroots. If you like the Beastie Boys then get this CD. If not then leave it for someone else to waste their money on.
1,Worst Game Ever,"After playing the namco edition, of the plug in, it left me satisfied and pleased I was even up for more even after playing the game for two hours straight. The namco game is highly reccomended to buy. It will be fun for hours. the first thing I wanted to do was go out and buy the atari edition, bad move a waste of money and not worth my time.The games were as boring as the graphics were bad. The games were EXTREMELY off. The only game that was even a little bit entertaining was missle command and even that was boring. These games do not even get more challenging as the game progresses. Every single level is exactly the same as the last one."
1,Seems to overheat after 4 minutes,"As others have mentioned, the graphics suddenly start to get corrupted after less than 5 minutes of playing. Turning the game off and back on doesn't seem to help, but leaving it off for 20 minutes or so before turning it back on will let you play for another couple of minutes before it becomes unplayable again. My best guess is that it's overheating."
2,What brainiac decided to include 5 non-joystick games?,"Adventure and Yar's Revenge make this stick worth buying, but it's very irritating that someone decided that 5 of the 10 included games should be unplayable.Three of them are ""paddle"" games (Circus Atari, Breakout, and Pong) and two of them are trackball games (Missle Command and Centipede). Yes, Missle Command and Centipede were played with the joystick on the home games, but there was an available trackball at the time that made them 10x more playable.So if Atari has hundreds (thousands?) of titles available, why would they choose to include 5 games that are next to impossible to play?I'd suggest buying the Namco 5-in-1 instead, but it has issues as well (runs much too fast, wrong sounds, etc..). Find a real 2600 at an online auction house if you want to satisfy your classic game appetite."
1,"Crap quality, not the original games","The games are utter crap. I've played Asteriods, Centipede, Breakout, and Missile Command before and know what they should be. What they are on this are ugly, misscolored, cheap recreations.Seriously how do you make the graphics on Asteriods worse? This thing is a disgrace and totally did not meet my expectations. The only one I found slightly amusing was pong. At least it was able to recreate 2 lines and a dot ball decently. (note, the ball is actually a square but you get over it)Breakout in particular plays like crap.Note - I did play one of these TV plug and games before that had various versions of PAC-MAN and Galaga which was very nice and had the actual original games. It had something that looked like an arcade coin slot in the front of the controller. I highly recommend that one."
3,Pong... WITHOUT A PADDLE???!!!!,"I LOVE ATARI. There. I said it. BUT... I can't believe they released this product the way they did.I gave this unit 3 stars because some of the games are perfecly translated, but games like Pong and Breakout, which were huge Atari favorites are unplayable without a paddle controller.Their choice of games could've been much better. Atari made quite a splash with their original game machine in the 70s, so they had a lot of titles to consider. Why they would include games which were designed for a paddle rather than a joystick is beyond reason.I looked forward to sharing some of my childhood favorites with my young nephew, only to be let down by the execution.Centipede, Asteroids and Missile command are worth the price for the entire unit... I also enjoyed solving Adventure one more time, but the rest were pretty forgetable."
2,Not his best work,"I was dissappointed with this album; it is very housey, and very repetitive - after a while the songs all sound a like. His previous albums are far superior. Bummer, another one bites the dust..."
1,A waste of money.,"this is one of the poorest pepper mills I've ever used. Even after 30 seconds of grinding there is just a very light dusting of pepper. I also doesn't seem to matter how you adjust it, you only get very fine pepper, just can't get coarse ground at all."
4,Excellent reference dictionary for those minor doubts!,"This is a small reference dictionary arranged alphabetically, that references customary problematic concepts in Spanish with a clear explanation why a verb, noun, preposition etc. can or cannot be used in a certain way and gives examples of the common errors made by native and non-native speakers. I found it to be quite helpful since regular dictionaries give the meaning of the words and possibly an example of its usage in a sentence but does not explain the logic behind errors made when using a particular word or phrase etc. The dictionary falls under the category of ""autoaprendizaje"" which means self-study because the kind of queries that the book covers would interests native or near native speakers. This is an excellent reference dictionary for teachers, professionals and advance Spanish speakers. I only wish it were a little bigger!"
4,Nice scale,"We like this scale because of it's nice wide platform and big display. It seems to be accurate and is easy to operate - you just step on. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it only measures in .5 pound increments (such as 125.0, 125.5, 130.0, 135.5, etc.). I wish it measured in .10 increments. However, I probably should of thought about that before I picked this one out as it probably was in the item description. Otherwise, it's a very nice scale and we definitely recommend it."
4,Scale review,Great Scale but it is not small. If you are looking for a small sized scale.. this is not it..
2,"Maybe it is a good product, but I did not get a good one",It is a little broken when I got it frok UPS. I think maybe that is the reason for cleanrance. And I got a bigger tube where the water run out. So it can not work at all.
1,Bad experience,"Just after one year, the water level control system is broken and the water flood my apartment. Call the importer's customer service, they said they did not have any parts for it. Really bad experience for this product."
4,RV Living,"The order only took 8 days from the date I placed the order to arrive on my door step..I live on the MA/RI line and this came from califorina.UPS is great!!!!5 stars for them<br /><br />I'm using this 8.8 haier washer in my 44 ft Hyline Trailer.It fits nicely in the closet and the casters provide excellent mobile ability to the kitcken sink,being only 21&quot;by 21&quot; height,and 36 in height this is just the right size.It washes great,I was a little afraid it would not wash right...Not at all,this washes just as good as a full size machine,It's the sight of it that takes getting use to.<br />The drain hose could be made of a little more flexible material,it's a little stiff...But the hook up to the faucet was perfect..Thanks Haier for this product!You should hook up with RV makers"
1,Not that good,"There were so few negative reviews, that I mistakenly thought this would be a great album. It is not. It isn't heavy in the psychedelic sense, or in any way. Short, with songs that are just OK. Sounds like it would take you places like a trip album, but it doesn't. The cover looks like it, too. Kind of an overpriced fraud to me."
4,"Don't Break the Oath, Melissa!","Upon reading Martin Popoff's, ""The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time,"" I found a Top Ten list by both Michael Denner and Hank Sherman, they of the godly Mercyful Fate. Oddly, Captain Beyond's debut occupied the #2 position on BOTH lists. I had only the vaguest notion of who Captain Beyond were. After twenty minutes on AllMusic, Amazon and a couple of other resource, I had my legions scanning all the globe for a copy. It arrived yesterday.I am not disappointed and you will NOT be either. I totally understand why this was such an influence on Mercyful Fate and tons of bands since the mid-'90s that have sought to combine Black Sabbath and Hawkwind. Although I've no Cathedral records at hand, I GUARANTEE Lee Dorian or Gaz Jennings worship this thing just as much as Sherman/Denner.Gorgantic Supernovulation!!!!"
2,this is not a good choice!,today the left pedal fell off. Now I can not tighten the pedal as tight as I should have.i don't know how to fix it.
1,Shallow characters,"This book made me angry at myself for taking the time to finish it. The characters were all one dimensional, shallow and uninteresting. The ending was completely out of character. What a waste!"
4,The reader makes the story,"I bought this audiobook because it was read by Zeljko Ivanek, a greater actor than is implied by the small bio on the inside. His reading brought a lot to a pretty standard legal thriller. If had been reading it on my own, there is a good chance I'd take my time to get to that ""suprise ending."" Mr. Ivanek gave each of the around twenty different characters a voice and a tone of his own, and that alone is worth the price! I recommend hearing it for yourself."
1,Amateurish!,"What a truly awful book!The characters were completely unbelievable and so cliched they made me cringe with embarrassment.The writing and dialogue were diabolical and the word 'amateurish' sprang out at me!I don't know about ""couldn't put it down"" - I just wanted to fling it across the room!!"
2,Smells Toxic,"When we opened the package the pad had a toxic-like odor. We left it out in the room for a couple of days and the odor didn't go away. We aren't going to expose our baby to odors, even if the product states that it is made from non-toxic materials. It wasn't very expensive so it's not the time and trouble to send it back. I regret not coughing up [...] for the organic pad."
4,After 3 years later..,"I had bought this item 3 1/2 years ago. I used it w/o any covers, it was easy to wipe down & didn't stained. But we have to eventually trash it due to wear & tear from daily use after 2 boys. I was happy w/ this pad b/c it was very contour, which kept my squirmy lil' guys in. :)"
2,Plastic rips and cracks too easily,"Bought this and had it shipped especially from the States to the UK because it looked better than what I could find here. It is nice and long and the sides do make it difficult, not impossible, for a baby to roll. But the plastic cover cracked and split before I'd had it very long. Even with the towel cover, there is still a possibility that pee can get through and soaked up in the sponge underneath, making it smell of urine."
2,A Short Life-Span,"I was surprised at the many favorable reviews of this product. As I was reading I realized that many of the other people noticed the same problems I had but didn't find them as troublesome as I did.The comfort of the pad is great. However, it does stain quite easily. It is easy to clean, but the stain remains. The main problem I had was that the material rips very easily. The pad ripped before my son turned 1. I would prefer a better made product that would make it through my son's infancy."
1,buyer beware - item never received,"I ordered this product on 5/30 and two weeks later, it still has not shipped. I contacted Baby Age and in all fairness to them, they have wonderful customer service. The issue seemed to be with the manufacturer, Basic Comfort. Baby Age re-entered the order for me twice with no response from Basic Comfort. Baby Age just cancelled the order for me. I'm very disappointed, but again, I don't blame Baby Age at all; they were great!"
4,Good waterproof pad with non-skid backing,The pad is nice and thick with a waterproof covering and good non-skid backing. The boppy changing pad cover fits perfectly.
2,A Struggle to live up to TMV,"Chris O'Brien is intensely intuitive, believably skeptical, and genuinely honest in his new book. But has he been abducted, or brainwashed, or threatened by the govornment? Only you can decide when you read this convoluted, disjointed, and baffling narrative of experiences in the San Luis Valley."
1,tabloid trash at its worst,"O'Brien, the self-proclaimed ""renowned ufologist"", was incomprehensibly given a second book contract from the geniuses at St. Martins Press after his first tour-de-force, Mysterious Valley.Apparently having run out of UFO and cattle mutilation stories, O'Brien's second book is a rambling, poorly written discourse on such inane topics as devil sightings, teleporting nuns, self-flagellating religious zealots, cannibalism, hollow-earth stories and appearances of leprechauns.Don't even think about descending to his level in regard to this book."
2,Best surprise was the batteries,"This kit is not worth the money unless you're getting a rebate on it. The camera bag is much bigger than necessary for most cameras and has no way to be attached to a belt. The tripod is tiny, but does do the job. It's only about 4 inches high, no kidding! The best surprise was that the rechargeable batteries were better than advertised, mine shipped with batteries rated at 1950 miliamps. That's the highest rating I've seen for AA batteries! I'm still using my first pair after almost a month of use without recharging."
5,So pretty,The Care Bears books have the prettiest illustrations of any books I've seen. They're so colorful and really keep kids' attention.
4,Technical -- Advanced,"Covers virtually anything do do with black and white processing. Provides all the 'How To"" so lacking in other books. Does not omit non-Ilford developers, but includes charts for them as well. But the book is certainly for the serious ameteur or pro, and is very technical. I really need the data provided on a daily basis, so the techical aspects don't bother me -- they're a plus! But others may find the book too much and wish simpler explanations. I'm biased here."
4,Relevant today--in warfare and everyday life,"""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu is a book that is just as relevant today as it was when it was written. Only now, life isn't as simple To some, things like careers, sports, and love are considered just as cutthroat as any conflict between warring nations. If one is willing to see their world in the simplest terms, there are no limits to the knowledge they can receive from studying this book."
3,Mick Taylor shows all how to play virtuoso blues guitar,"Sorry folks, perhaps the place was a shade too warm or maybe these blues greats had one too many drinks before the show ... for me, the highlight was Mick Taylor's brilliant guitar playing even after showing much respect (by not upstaging) for the musicians he listened to as he was learning to play the blues.The audio quality is certainly not the best and it does get a little rough around the edges during the jams ..... hey, but this is the blues, not opera"
5,A Classic,"An excellent manual on tempera grassa (egg-oil emulsions) published in 1935. The authors provide basic recipes, among much other good information, on different oil-water to water-oil emulsions. Tempera grassa is a variation of tempera painting that some believe to have been used by artists in the 16th century during the transition by European artists from pure egg tempera painting to oil painting. Although it has less than a hundred pages (in plain text with no illustrations), this book is still an excellent ""textbook"" classic for anyone who would like to learn more about the tempera grassa technique. Tempera grassa was later revived by the late great 20th century Italian portraitist Pietro Annigoni and his known recipes for tempera grassa resemble those given in this book."
2,Not useful,"My best description of the book is ""not useful"". The book never really talks about anything technical, and does not cover the basics very well.All in all, it seems to be mostly marketing material for his retreats, his conferences, his world tour, his users group and his other books, some of which have not yet been published.At best, it gives a superficial glance at the SBS2003 product and does a poor job at connecting all the dots."
1,English version has French Subtitles,The 2nd disk with the restored version in English has French subtitles that cannot be turned off. The subtitles are in the picture and are extremely annoying.
4,It's a PORTABLE washing machine not a HEAVY DUTY one,"I feel I made a good decision purchasing the product. I have two suggestions to some of the previous reviewers: 1. Read and FOLLOW the users' manual carefully. 2. Do not overload the machine. Some heavy clothes especially jeans are harder to balance when spinning. This is a problem of any SMALL washers not only for this particular product. My experience is, jamming the machine with more than three jeans is not a good idea, but pants made with softer material are ok. The washer can easily handle a Queen size spread sheet plus some little items."
1,Miserable experience,"The machine began leaking not long after bringing it home. Be warned: the policy of Haier is to completely replace the machine, even for such a minor malfunction. And to add insult to injury, you have to send it in yourself (keep the box, for godssakes) and pay the shipping and handling. And for you Brooklynites, avoid Super Sound Electronics and Appliances on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint at all costs. Not only wouldn't they service the machine, they refused to replace it. Evidently, the idea of a warranty is a new one to these shysters."
4,handy dandy machine,"I bought this portable washer for my 19 Ft RV trailer, when I took it to florida last winter. I set it up to sit on a board across the back of the bathtub, very out of site and out of my way too... I use the bathroom sink with the quick spring hook up to fill it and drain it directly into the bathtub. I also purchased some white suction cup hooks and stuck them directly to the back of the machine to hold the drain hose in the proper place... as if the drainhose is drooping at all, the water drains out while filling it up. I think it does a super job!! I have had no problems with it whatsoever, and when I want to take a bath, it is easy enough to lift it out of my way... Having a washing mahine when I go R-ving is pretty kewl...indeed. I enjoy having more free time, while on vacation.....no laundrymats..for me anymore."
5,Well made unit,"This machine has been a life saver.. I use it mostly for light clothing just a couple pieces at a time due to its small size...a week's supply of under shirts, skivvies and socks are no problem....one or two medium towels or maybe one or two sweat suits are fine....no problems within the year that I have it and the clothes come out as clean as our full size unit upstairs second floor, although I have to say the action on the larger loads doesnt seem like it would clean as well as it does.....would I buy the same again...absolutely.....wish they made a similar dryer though....I cant find one anywhere............."
4,very good small washer,This little washer works pretty good. Fast and clean. Save enery and time. Not consuming too much water and electricity.One thing bad is that the faucet adaptor is not strong enough. It was pushed away by the water pressure the first time I used it. I replaced it with an all-screw adapter bought from homedepot. Then everything is OK.I realy like this washer.
5,excellent product,"I bought and used this product for more than 1.5 years. It works perfect the way I want till today.I was planning to use this machine to wash my baby's clothes. It is a life saver for me in our apartment everyday with frequent cleaning need of my new born(now toddler)'s clothes.The only thing you want to be careful is that if you load too much clothes, or if the clothes are not evenly loaded, the machine might stop in between when spinning until you spread the clothes evenly in the machine. I also like the music at the end to remind me that the washing is done as I am usually busy with other things at home. Other than that, I am pretty happy with it. A must have for new borns."
1,bad seller!!!!,"I am very disapointed with my package, first of all it came damage the balloons has a hole wich does not keep the helium for very long. And second of all I had to pay an additional $1.30 to be able to get my package from the postal services. The postal services did not leave my package at my shipping address I had to drive to get it after. I am not very happy with this experience since they came on time but i couldnt get them from the postal services until today. Wich its already too late. Im planing to use them again but they are not able to be use.and finally, I wrote a review that has not been published"
3,Wouldn't buy the component cables,Love the Audio Digital Optical Cable but couldn't tell the difference with the componenet cables
3,Interesting- almost TOO interesting....,I firmly believe anyone who has ever been at a loss for weird trivia in the game of 'One-up-manship' will benefit from reading this book. Sort of a 'Grossology' for adults..
3,Fashion Feast,The only reason to wach this very silly movie is to experience the glorious fashions of the early 1960's. But they are pretty glorious. Paul Newman at the height of his physical perfection is another type of eye candy. Brad who?
3,A new kind of love,"It is the kind of movie that one enjoys because, due to the lack of special effects, the actors were required to act and the writers had to have a great story that captured the attention of the audience. These qualities are sadly lacking in many of todays' movies."
3,A New Kind of Love,As a fan of Paul Newman I thought this film would be entertaining especially with the costar his wife. Cute is the best I could say about the film. The film was staged in Paris which was nice but it still had a predictable simple story line. The film copy I own has a low sound track that will suddenly get louder and requires turning the sound up and then down.
3,Good but over done,"I liked this book in parts, it was a necessary evil so to speak in the series. Although I feel it got drug out with unnecessary detail at times. It did provide needed background into Timmy's life. The leather factory scene toward the end was a little far fetched for my liking though, I realize that statement may sound ridiculous coming from a horror fan but alas......"
3,"Great concept, lacking on execution.","The magic of Bush's verbal gaffes is that they are plentiful and unyielding. It's hard to fault the makers of this DVD for wanting to inject their own commentary on Bush's blunders, but it weakens the overall effect when you have ""Title Card""/""Bushism""/""Commentary-Joke"" one after the other... Just let the man speak... uninterrupted... rapid-fire... without blunting the damage by slowing the whole thing down to a crawl. Perhaps long strings of these exist online. I guess that's why we have the internets."
1,Shipping damage remains an issue,"I cannot comment on the performance of this machine since I applied for a refund 5 minutes after I opened the box. My machine had multiple and major dents on all three sides of the machine, the back for some reason had no dents. On one side at the bottom there was an 8"" dent over 1-1.5"" deep. It looked like someone had kicked it...hard. The cosmetics did not overly concern me but I could have no confidence in a unit that was as badly mistreated as this one. The packaging was minimal and insuffucient to prevent damage. Delivery was by UPS. On the positive side, UPS picked up the machine the very next day for return and refund. I will now try to find the machine locally since the majority of reviews - excepting damage reports - seem pretty good."
2,"You can only count on it for about 1.5 years, never cocunt on haier customer service","My washer was already more than a year old, it worked fine until one day it smoked from inside the machine. One electric unit burned and melt the water resistance plastic barrier. We are lucky we found it right away, no fire happened. Hope you have the same luck too.On the other side, don't count on their customer service, I contact both HaierUSA and Haier China headquarter more than a week ago, HaierUSA never reply me, Haier Headquarter no resolution either.No more Haier."
1,Avoid this machine. Nothing come out clean,"My experiences with this machine is nothing but pain. Maybe I just have a bad machine. It starts and failed after the water was filled the machine. Gave me a E2 error code, whatever that is. The soaks were there after the operations was done. It usually take over an hour. The water was leaking from the bottom, and it was like my 10th washes with my machine.After farther research this machine and found out this machine was banned from Australia. I suspect the many reviewers are affiliate with the company."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I received this washer dented on one side and the botton panel. One of the back legs for the wheel was also damaged. I called customer service and they did not want to give a good enough discount so I decided to return. I am not quite sure if I will buy any other appliance off the site because they were not very helpful and the washer was out of stock, so it could have been 3 weeks before I could have gotten a new washer."
1,Shiped broken.,"I decided to take my chances despite some reviews on this item since it seemed like a good buy.However I did not have the chance to try it out since it arrived broken.Beware of bangs outside the washer that come from the inside. Apart from the aesthetic problem, as it was my case, the bangs also resulted in some internal damage. Two of the plastic pieces that hold the washer basin on place were broken and I did not dare to plug and try it out. In another review somebody wrote that the washer jumped like a crazy horse and I can imagine that his problem had the same origin."
5,Great for condo or apartment,"After living in a condo with the wash room down the hall it is a joy to be able to wash in my own home and have the softener dispencer right in the machine so I don't have to keep going to the wash room trying to time the rinse cycle for the softener.I don't have to get dressed or comb my hair now to do the washing.Easy to move to the sink, gets clothes clean, several cycles and options."
5,Clean Lather,"Lathers up great, has great scent, easy pop top, and doesn't take more than a nickle sized glob on a poof sponge to clean your whole body."
3,Update the cast list!,"This wasn't the best movie ever made, but it wasn't terrible, either. Amazon.com, you need to update your cast list! Vanessa Williams was the voice of Beauty, Gregory Hines was the voice of the Beast, Paul Winfield was the voice of Beauty's father, and Debbie Allen was the voice of her sister, Precious. If you're wondering what Robert Guillame's role was, he was the narrator! I think the person who was the voice of her brother, Tree, was named something like Treat Williams. Whoever did the cast list for this movie needs to pay better attention to the closing credits!"
2,This device is outdated!,"I know it says that it does NOT work for SOCOM 2 but it should say: HEADSET DOESNT WORK FOR ANY GAME MADE AFTER THE YEAR THAT THE ORIGINAL SOCOM CAME OUT. No recent games are compatible with this, it has to be from like 1999 or below.It doesn't work for MADDEN 2006, SOCOM 3, RAINBOW SIX: LOCKDOWN and every other game I have that uses a headset. Buy at own risk, although its pretty good for the computer and it shuts off ur speakers when u plug it and transfers the sound to the headset."
1,talk net head set does not work,this does not work with my u.s. socom 2 but it does work with nba live 2004 this is not right please email me back at tr558@aol.com plaese help me with my problem
1,How bad could it really be?,"Honestly I bought this as a back up pump to use for emergencies and I hate it! It is the worst pump I have ever used! You would be better off getting a manual pump. It took me about 45 minutes to pump 3 oz. I would honestly not recommend this pump to anyone. I think they are a great company and I LOVE their bottles but this pump is horrible. There is a reason why it it $27, instead of the $100+ they originally valued it at!!"
2,Unhappy,"I have to agree with those who say it is good for occasional use only. I first experienced problems with the pain I felt from the sheild, the bumps are left embedded on your breasts. But even that wasn't the worst. After only a few uses it began to clog in the small compartment and overflow, unless the suction was broken to release. Which causes the process to take longer. I am now back to work and am looking for a more agreeable pump."
3,Not bad for occasional use,"I purchased this pump for occasional use while on maternity leave. It was a good investment for short time use, as I didn't want to spend the money on a more elaborate pump before I was sure that breastfeeding/pumping was well established. Once I got use to pumping, I was able to express about 4 ounces in about 10 minutes (massaging the breast while pumping really helps). It gave me the ability to build up a nice reserve of milk before going back to work, which was the main reason for the purchase. At times, I was sore after use, but with the suction adjustments, this was not an ongoing problem. The biggest drawback for me was the noise! It is rather loud and tends to sound like a cow mooing - not exactly conducive to pumping away from home! I have moved on to a Medela pump for full time use at work. It is much quieter and gentler, but also much more expensive."
1,Does Not Work At All,Received item in good time. Assembled it according to instructions. Tried it. Nothing happens. It turns on ok but that's it. No real sucking action and no milk coming out. Buy a better one instead.
2,Not for frequent pumping,"Because of budget constraints I bought this pump. It worked great when I pumped if my son didn't nurse completly at some feedings. When I started back to work and had to pump every 2-3 hours the suction started to fail. I broke down and bought a better pump. This one gave a little pain at the beginning, but I got used to it. It is also fairly noisy. Not a good thing when I am having to pump at work.If you are going to be a frequent/exclusive pumper, break down and get a better pump."
3,Not happy,"I thought I would like this but,after 3 washes the plastic ring srunk snd now the suction is very bad! not a happy breastfeeder."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I found this pump on a sale rack (there were 2 of them) and they were so cheap I bought both of them. The first one I tried lasted 1 week. The second one lasted 2 weeks. I was pumping once a day. The suction would no longer release on both pumps. I don't feel so bad because I didn't pay that much for this product but hope to save you $39.99 by writing this review.
1,Save your money!,"I don't plan on returning to work, so I wanted a pump to use only occasionally. After using this pump for less than 2 weeks, it completely lost ALL suction. And it didn't work very well even before that. It could take 10 minutes to get 1-2 ounces. Thank goodness Babies R Us allowed me to exchange it. There was no way I wanted to exchange it for the same product. I was able to get an Avent Isis & I LOVE it! I initially assumed electric would be better, but the Isis hand-pump works SO much better! Don't waste your money on the Natural Comfort pump."
1,Breast Infection,I am a first time mom and had no idea how breastfeeding would go. After being home for a day or two I started using this pump just to see if had enough milk and to give my nipples a rest. I developed a breast infection and I truly believe it was due to this pump. It is terrible and it takes forever to get an ounce of milk. After having two infections in a two week period my Mom purchased me the Medela pump in style. It is a completely different experience. I have not had another infection and is not nearly as rough on my breast at this pump was. I also know someone else who used this pump and developed breast infections. She switched to the Medela and hasn't had anymore problems.
2,Mulberry is not my Cup 'o Tea,"I found this series to be quirky but not in a good way. The episodes are uneventful and ""gasp"" boring. The high caliber acting talent of Geraldine McEwan does not save the series from its beige pallet"
5,Excellent comedy with wonderful characters that makes one think,"Mulberry is one of the great comedies let alone a great British Comedy. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The characters are lovable and draw one in like an old friend. Geraldine McEwan is an accomplished actress that pulls the role of Ms. Farnaby off easily. Her timing is impeccable and her hard exterior shows enough of the soft interior to make you like the character while never feeling sorry for her. Karl Howman, Mulberry, plays a wonderful ""court jester"" in a way that highlights his warmth from the moment he enters the room. The relationship between the two of love and respect is lovely. This is a series that leaves one wanting more and is a pleasure to watch and quite possibly use in our own lives."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,I love the characters and storyline. I have watched this series several times and hate coming to the last episode.Definite must watch!
3,O.K. product,"The cross stitch software program is o.k. and can be used well, depending on expectations. It is easy to navigate and to understand, and by far not as complicated as PCStitch. The software is enough for any moderate hobby-stitcher. It is sufficient to import pictures, but one has to tweak the pattern so it becomes more realistic and closer to the original picture. Simple pictures with clear lines and few colors convert very nicely to useable cross stitch patterns.For designing your own patterns, I would not recommend this product. In truth, the free KGChart does a much better job in this area.But overall the program is cheap for the options it offers."
2,Not Great!,"This workout is supposed to be for beginners, but how is a beginner supposed to follow instructions that can barely be heard over the music! There are some slightly fancy moves that change regularly but it is difficult to follow when I can barely heard the instructors cues. I understand that some people like the music but I'm doing aerobics for the exercise not for the music.I also think that a beginners workout should have a little more explaination of the moves.All in all, it's probably a good workout but I spent most of the time trying to figure out what was going on and trying to catch up because I couldn't hear her saying what was coming next. Plus she doesn't give much forewarning that a change is coming, but I think that after doing the workout a few times most people will be able to figure it out."
1,I GOT BURNED. BAD.,"Although this camera took good pictures and was user friendly, it broke down after only two months. I sent it to Casio repair and they said it had suffered water corrosion and the damage was NOT covered by warranty. I did not get it wet, take it out in the rain, or treat it badly...yet it broke down in almost no time...and I am out $300 bucks. So, I MUST warn anyone considering buying it: WHY TAKE THE CHANCE WITH A CAMERA SO OBVIOUSLY FRAGILE?? DON'T DO IT!!Needless to say, I'll NEVER buy a Casio camera again."
2,let down,i have had 4 other casio cameras before this and not once have they disappointed me. This camera was a disappointment. the features never work right and you can't save the type of photo quality you want it to have to memory and the timer doesn't work properly. it is not good. the exz1000 is much better
4,"Ah, The Pity of It...","This is a film that haunts me (especially the first part) so much that for years I couldn't bring myself to write a review on. And yet the look of the small boy in the sleeve brings back so much vivid memories: the same sort of impact of the War Photo showing a shocked, naked small Asian girl (aged 5 or 6?) on the run, crying, taking flee on her own from a bomb upon Japanese invasion... It doesn't have to show you the actual act of violence or brutality. His helplessness in the vastness of the desolate mountainous slopes is just omnipotent and I still can't bring myself to go back to it. It is almost as shocking as a Georgian film from Russia in B/W that I had seen decades ago. One star taken off for its bitter sadness, for it weighs so heavy in your heart..."
1,False advertising!,"Doesn't this ad look like you get a set of four spreaders? Well, guess again. Only one is sent. But with the way this company does business - I ordered a ""set"" (Ha) on December 11th. The ONE spreader wasn't sent until Jan 7th, and only after I sent a letter of complaint to them and to Amazon. Oh, and I never got a response to the complaint letter either."
4,loved it one his best stories,One his best books. Loved the main characters. Keep you going to the very end. Love how he works in the christian point of veiw
2,Bait and Switch for Jesus,I only made it halfway through. I got lost in the finding Jesus by the attorney trying the case. Especially when this attorney wants others to share the same experience. I expected a legal thriller and got a sermon instead. I want my money back.
3,Not his best...,"I read ""The Justice Game"" first. That was a well written legal thriller, akin to vintage Grisham. Some of the characters in ""Justice Game"" had and expressed Christian beliefs---but this worked well with the plot line and was not intrusive. Without having known in advance, I don't know that I would have labled ""The Justice Game"" as Christian fiction.Because I enjoyed ""The Justice Game"", I purchased ""Self Incrimination"". This book is well written enough to be more or less entertaining. But the plot is not as well developed---it is pretty obvious where the story is headed. And the preachiness and ""saving ourselves for marriage"" aspect of the story seems forced and overbearing. In my opinion, this book is Chritian fiction first and a legal thriller second."
4,Johnny and Duane,Johnny Jenkins was a great interpreter of this genre of music. Combine that with Duane Allman's phenomenal playing and it doesn't get any better than this.
3,"The Duane tracks are classic, others not so much","I came to this album via Duane Anthology. All Duane's tracks are dcovered on Anthology. Hence the additional, New to me material is not up to that grade. But it has deep roots and soul and is much better than the disposable candy that passes for music these days!"
1,False advertisment,"Bonsai tree received without flower. Not even a bud.Followed direction: out door, under protected sun light.Watered as directed.Pot taken indoor when windy and rainy.3 months later, still no flowers, no bud.Leaves look like they are dying: dull, dry, brittleAbsolutely disappointed. Item received was no way near what wasadvertised/described. Will not purchase from this vendor again."
3,Brussel's DT3066AZ Satsuki Azalea Outdoor Bonsi,I ordered this plant in may for my mom for Mother's day. I don't know about the like of the plant as we did not receive the plant that I ordered. The box and the invoice state that it was the azalea outdoor bonsi but a Rhododendron plant was received instead. you might want to check you order closely when opening the box and check the tag as it might not be what you ordered. can't properly rate this item as we never received this item. it is difficult to rate something you never received in the first place so it's ok is the best choice i could make.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the Azalea Bonsai Tree. First of all the picture that was represented on this site was not what I actually received. For the money spent, I was truly disappointed with the size and everything else. I would not order this item again."
3,only for diehard petheads,"I enjoyed the other CD single with all the fabulous mixes of ""Normally"" better than this. However, this shows that the Boys are still invested in making great B-sides and re-interpreting old classics. I think both ""Normally"" and ""Too Many People"" tell stories about concerns that the artists have as gay men. It was daring of the Boys to remix ""West End Girls"" since many incorrectly think of that song as their one-hit opus. Only diehard fans should make sure they have this disc."
5,Why in the world ...,Why in the world does someone sign up on a site and write one review of an album they have never heard by an artist they are woefully ignorant about?This isnt really my kind of music ... [I'm much more likely to pop on some black or death metal] ... but I still have some really great childhood memories of this artists music being played by my mother. Country-ish gospel music that certainly deserves better than some 1 star review by someone that doesnt even know what they are talking about.
4,Faithful rendition of a Tchaikovsky classic,"If you are looking for a CD that will clearly push the limits of your audiohphile system, this is it. The combination of the orchestra playing full out, combined with the bells and digitally recorded cannons makes for a real challenge for any system. Be sure to heed the warning on setting a reasonable level during playback. Not doing so guarantees a trip to the stereo repair show and perhaps also to an audiologist."
2,So bad it's good,"I don't really know how to rate this movie. If I attempt to watch it as the serious film that it was intended to be then it would be a 1 star film. If I rate it on the amusement I get from watching how dumb the characters are, then it rates a 4. And dumb they are... You really must see it to appreciate it. I swear their IQs drop in half about halfway through the movie. It's always a good day when I discover that my TiVo has found this movie, but now it's time for me to buy the DVD before this comic gem is lost to time."
2,This guy missed the whole point of riding.,How can a man spend so much money on a bike and ride so many miles and totally miss the point of what biking is about? He is the best example of a yuppie poser I have ever heard or read about. Didn't he meet any real bikers on his travels?I thought the book was well written but ridicules in content
4,One man and his toy.,"Having ridden Harleys for more than ten years and now on my fifth model I am well and truly hooked. My latest (and last) is a 2000 FLSTC. This has been the subject of many late night viewing sessions, of which I am sure my wife was convinced I was losing the plot. Everything La Plante goes thru in this book is for real and I can identify with just about all of it apart from the deception to his wife. It also confirmed my amazement that at 45 years old I can hold as much reverance to a motorcycle as I did to my first pushbike as a kid. His honesty and wit are so reassuring and I am glad I don't have any gold eagles on my rides anymore! The book is a great read and my only dissapointment was it came to an end. He confirms the old saying ""Men never grow up, just the price of the toys!"""
2,Overrated,"This novel is mediocre at best, about an old married couple that are hardly unique or even interesting. I read it in a few hours and moved on to another book."
5,Great for the price.,When i got this pressure cooker it was on sale and plus free shipping it is worth the money it gets your cooking in no time.I like the extra cover it comes in handy i am very pleased.The shipping was very fast too i was surprised.
5,Can Really Feel a Difference,"I am a Type A personality and this product really takes the edge off. I feel relaxed -- not like taking a drug or having a glass of wine, but just mellow. I would recommend this to anyone who just needs to calm down a bit. It takes a little bit of time to build up in your system, so do not expect immediate results. Highly recommend."
3,They were OK,I have used these (memeorex) the TDK and the Sony mini-dvd's. These work ok but seemed to be slightly off balance causing a slight vibration in the camcorder. Nothing was evident on the video. I am using a Sony camcorder so of course I get the annoying sony proprietary message about the media. The TDK's or the sony mini-dvd's did not cause the vibration.
5,"3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry is good",I will use it to freshen up my college skills that I've forgotten.Many good examples.
5,wonderful sound,"It,s been so much what audiophiles lost because that format's war! only whishblue ray technology be able retake SACD use."
4,"Not too far, not too fast.","I am rather inept at learning other languages, and the Haitian-Creole: Pimsleur Language Program works pretty good for me. However, it took me very little time to get to the end of the five tapes - and it didn't seem as though I learned that much. They offer a booklet with Creole words - but you never learn what they mean - although you learn how to pronounce them wonderfully.Bottom line: It is a good introductory program, the quality is good, but I feel the cost is a little too high for the volume of material covered (or not covered)."
3,One Hot Scene,This otherwise lame video has one hot scene that is too short. She pours milk over body and a guy goes to town with simulated sex. Carmen Electra has one of the all-time best bodies ever. I know they didn't cast her for her acting skills so they should have had her nude a lot more. I bought this to see her nude and felt ripped off. Do yourself a favor and rent it. Then go buy Jennaville or America's Wildest Bachelor Parties to see some real nudity.
1,Piece of Junk,"We had this unit for all of three months before it sprung a leak in the back and soaked the carpet in our apartment. When we called customer service they told us that we had to have the original receipt from when we bought it in order to get any kind of customer service. I'm sorry, is that standard?? I have never had anyone ask me for the original receipt. I will definitely never buy one of these again."
4,"Big, complete, but readable","Bellos' big, exhaustive raccount of the life and works of one of France's most contreversial modern writers is a thorough insight, both into the family background, the struggles of a writer trying to make a living, and the works themselves. Perecs' books, peppered with clues, quizzes and games, are reinterpreted, giving the reader a new incentive to go back to the texts to more fully understand the author, as essentially a ""normal"" man."
3,Nice job with broken amps,"While this is a truly delightful set of modern, original surf tunes, with wonderfully catchy and exotic melodies (wanna know what ringing chords are? Go to the ""Love Canal""), I'm rather disappointed with the recording, which almost ruins the fun at times: ear-jarring, highly unclean guitar, plus cardboard-like drums often too low in the mix. Of course I don't really believe the Mosquitos' equipment to be kaputt - those amps, they just seem overdriven -, but if this is the way they wish to sound like, well, not a good idea. Then there's no need to be as ultra-smooth as, say, The Penetrators either - ""Release the Mosquitos"", their own album number two, would be the very point of reference. -- Still like it a lot, but in this case, the download version will do for me."
4,Nice!,"I am a jazz man but exploring new music. Therefore, I don't know how qualified I am to evaluate this area of music other than the fact that I know what sounds good to my ears. This music is very cool sounding. Very spectacular as the title indicates as well as explosive and dynamic. Along with the tonal colors and textures, this music is very satisfying to my ears. I would also assume, the better the audio system the better the performance you get. Recommended."
5,It made my car speakers shake from the excitement,"Here in Miami the traffic is so bad, you need something to cure the boredom. My car audio system takes care of that. When I listened to this CD, the performances were so exciting, it made the speakers shake. As for the individual performances, I liked the Liszt Les Preludes best simply because good performances of this wonderful piece are very rare. The Dukas could use a little more poetry in the quieter moments but everything else is just super, a fantastic CD."
2,"A Major Disappointment, Unfortunately!","I bought the disc for the Weinberger ""Polka and Fugue,"" a piece I love so much it gives me chills just thinking about it, it entirely transports me to another world where everything is wonderful and grand, I honestly want it to be played at my funeral -- but I find not only this performance but every other selection presented on this album as a complete failure. Yes it truly is sonically spectacular, Yes the orchestra is ultra-transparent throughout due to the amazing recording, but, I am really sorry to say, I find an absolutely ubiquitous consistent lack of darkness or color or mood or swagger. I mean, come on, for crying out loud, The Sorcerer's Apprentice should have you on your feet! Instead, it's just a lot of bumping and thumping. Also, I find the horns totally underwhelming."
5,Parrothead Meets Country Music Fan,Jimmy Buffett mixes his pop Carribean style with classic country to produce an amazing CD. This CD is amazing from song 1 to song 16. His lineup of old and new country artists doesn't pad his talents but rather compliments them perfectly. Rather than a CD that produces one or two singles I wouldn't be surprised to hear at least five singles out of this amazing CD. Thank you Jimmy.
2,Red-faced buffoon overstays welcome - details @ ten!!!!,"Do we really need another in-yer-face Margaritaville ballad? This cat sez no. The alcohol-fueled Jimmy Buffett (Evil JB as he's known to hardcore groupies and warring Jim Brickman fans) has aligned himself with hardcore pop-country artists this time 'round, and the results are mixed at best. It remains to be seen how long this bloated, beach ball-lovin' cowboy will soldier on, but one thing is truth: This album ain't gonna win anyone over, JB fan or not.On da positive side, Da Peace Dogg is out of retirement, due to pop-u-lar D-mand!!!!See ya!!!!!!!!!!"
2,To much country,"This was just to much country for this parrothead. I liked one song, Piece of Work and that was about it."
4,Where are the writing credits?,"Like all true Buffett fans, any new Buffett record is an immediate must-own. All in all a pretty good cd, but I am troubled by the fact that I could not find any songwriter credits in the jacket or on the cd. As a huge fan of songwriters, I recognized several of the songs, but what a missed opportunity for exposure to the mainstream music crowd for folks like Guy Clark and John Hiatt. (I have 3 old LPs framed on my wall, my first Buffett record, my first Guy Clark record (autographed!), and my first John Hiatt). PLEASE Jimmy, help acquaint your fans with the brilliant writer's own music through your excellent versions of their songs!"
2,Enjoy Jimmy's earlier work more so...,"Jimmy at his best is when he is desperate for a tune and a story and that is early in his career...nice that he has branched out and tried new, but not my style."
3,Too Much Country,"As a longtime Jimmy Buffett fan, I really don't particularly like this new CD because it has just too much of a country flavor...instead of spicy Carribean flare. I'm not a country music fan....and I'm disappointed. Buffett performed several songs from this album on his concert tour this summer. I still didn't like them."
2,"What happened to albums like A1A, Changes, and the like?","Oh yeah, that's right, Jimmy grew up. Oh well, the party can't last forever. At least I can throw on ""You Had To Be There"" and listen to what Buffett was really about.We can't continue to expect a 59 year old Buffett to be down in Monserrat with James Taylor drinking and snorting the day away while writing and recording the music. Dude's a pilot now and perhaps too mature for the old Buffett fans that refuse to grow up and realize that 1978 can't last forever.This album is fair in regards to getting new music...but I'll take the old stuff anyday of the week."
2,A bitter disappointment,"Normally, I am a great fan of Christopher Hogwood/the Academy of Ancient Music and their recordings. It was therefore with great anticipation that I listened to their recording of Mozart's C Minor mass, a piece which I was already quite familiar with and fond of. My anticipation soon turned to disappointment, however, for on this recording the voices -- the chorus in particular, but the soloists as well -- totally drown out the instrumental forces. To be sure, the singing is beautiful; but certainly the orchestra would sound beautiful, too, if one could only hear it. I suppose this is not the fault of Hogwood or the AAM, but rather of the recording technicians, who failed to achieve a proper balance. I now wish I had purchased another recording"
2,Not What I was Expecting,"I am a ballet dancer and when I purchased the DVD, I was hoping to get more in depth stretches or something I've never done before. Some of the stretches require a partner (which I don't always have at home during the day) and some of them require coaching, which she does not give. Not worth what I paid for it."
1,Non-stick but not-at-all-durable finish,"I am not a fan of non-stick surfaces because they peel/flake off (except All-Clad--their finish is amazingly durable) but this was touted as super durable, so I bought it. After 3 uses, the finish has flaked off in 5 different places. I am an avid home cook who knows how to properly use and care for kitchen equipment and cookware.I used an old version of this griddle, without a non-stick finish, and I LOVED IT. The manufacturer does not sell it any longer. I will look for one at a resale shop or EBay.Save your money--do not buy this."
4,A Great Grill,"I received this grill and immediately tried it out on two nice steaks. It was terrific. It distributed the heat evenly from my gas range. Its also heavy enough that when I put the two steaks on, it didn't seem to dip in heat. I'd forgotten how much splatter you get with a grill so there was a quite a bit of clean up. I think the side groove for oil or fat could be a little larger. The grill washed up with no problem, nothing stuck to it and I'm really looking forward to using it again."
5,Awesome product,I always wanted a reversible grill/griddle and I comparison shopped before I decided to go with Amazon.com. I received the product in good condition and exactly what I expected. I have a George Foreman grill that I no longer use due to the fact that I have a grill/griddle. The grill/griddle is easy to clean and really cooks food well once the grill has heated up. I have used the product to grill meats and vegetable along with making eggs and bacon. If you want a great grill this is the way to go.
4,Works fine,"I used this more before I bought the Cuisinart Griddler (the Griddler's plates are diswasher safe, my two favorite words.) I think the key is to adjust the temperature. Start on medium but as the food cooks, lower the temperature to keep juices from burning. I do not suggest it for marinades that contain a lot of sugar because the non-stick coating is delicate. If you do burn something, immediately after cooking, turn off the heat, leave the grill in place and pour water on it. Use a nylon scrub brush to loosen as much food as you can as the water steams. Dawn Power Dissolve works if things burn on it, but do not leave it on for a long time because it will damage the coating.A bonus is that it really does thaw foods fast too.Great product if you treat it well."
2,not great for electric,I bought this hoping to wow my family with some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great on my electric stove. If you leave it up too high for longer than a minute on the grill side the griddle coating burns off and stinks up the place. If you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks. I end up putting on high for a few minutes and then back down. Doesn't cook thick meat for chicken breast through well. You are better off finishing them in a real pan in the oven. The coating chips easily. I am thinking of going with cast iron as it is more work in the begining but I think it worth it in the long run.
4,"Great songs, not the best album","Mosta the songs where really good (10/15 is most right?) but it doesn't fit together into a overall great ""album"". It sort of sounds like someone just took a bunch of Brandy singles and made a compilation album; I mean, where are all the transitions and the logical song order?? Necessary could have been a great track, but they were trying to do too much, the beat sounds out of place. Like another reviewer said, a lot of the songs where technically good but just didn't have a that spark. Also I kind of think Brandy was trying to be Aaliyah on here, I could have honestly seen this being Aaliyah's next album if she hadn't passed."
2,Could have been better,"This album, I think, was the worst ever. It's good but Never Say Never was the best ever. The songs sound too much like something a new artist would come out with. All the songs are about a guy and then the lyrics sound too much alike. There were only 4 songs total that I listen to on the album. On Full Moon, there were probably 10 that I listen to. Then on Never Say Never, all the songs I like. The first album is good and there are probably 6 songs that I liked. She definitely should've stayed with her old producers."
2,Overproduced,"This cd contains too much bass notes, and I think that she tried too hard to become poplular again. I bought this cd, expecting it to be like her first and second cds, but it it more like the third one. It has too much production, and too many things are happening at the one time. It is too cluttered, and I find it hard to concentrate when listening to it. I think that timbaland is trying to create another aaliyah, but in reality, we really dont need another, One is enough."
1,Her worst...man she just lost a hard core fan.,"Brandy...this was your worst album. You shouldve stuck to your old formula. Your voice and Timb's dry attempt to create emotion didnt work out. Get back with Rodney. And just so you know I brought your cd and then sold it for half price, just to get rid of it. And to make matters worse my friend said she wanted her money back. TSK TSK"
4,This S*** Is The Hottest,You have to get this cd from start to finish it is classic. Trust just get it and listen. Brandy put her soul into this album.
3,Not her best work,This CD starts off good and then it sucks!!!I know she's not going to get a Grammy for this!
2,This album,"Is very different from other albums not the best, but different Listen to this album before purchasing."
1,I really dont know what to think,"When I first heard this album sometime last week, I was very dissapointed. There is only 2 slow ballads. The album to get was FULL MOON, which she didn't promote properly. I have always loved Brandy and her music, but I think she needs to stay with the people who produced Full Moon and all her previous albums.Before you purchase, please, please go to your local record store that let you listen to the CD. Then decide if it is worth your time and hard earned money."
4,A good comeback,"Brandy succesfully showed us what a woman she has come to be in this album. By being more mature with her lyrics and showing that she can sing more then just ballads. But I disagree with all of the work that was done with producer Timbaland, Brandy should have limited the work she done with this talented man and worked with more producers then just the majority of him. This album is rated as her second best album,even though this album may do better then ""Full Moon"" on the charts it will never be better then it vocally."
2,Not what I expected after hearing 1st single,"Should of stuck with either Kanye or Rodney on this one. Track one is beautiful and so is Talk about our Love. Brandy's voice is too beautiful to be drowned by Tim's beats and confusion. She can handle a ballad and it just didnt happen. I loved Aaliyah she was more of a performer than a singer and Brandy is a down right singer. She mention Aaliyah in more than one song, not being funny but Brandy this is your time to shine. Never Say Never reigns supreme and i cant say it enough. Rodney knows you best. Full Moon even had more to offer. But if you are happy thats all that matters. I should have went to MTV.com and leaked the cd before i bought it."
2,Could have saved the money,"I really like Brandy, but this time I am not impressed. The beats are way too strong for Brandys sweet,low voice. There are only a few songs that are enjoyable in particular Talk about our love. This cd does sound like songs for Aaliyah. When I put the cd in I knew something was wrong, It just didn't sound like Brandy. No wonder, she isn't with her old producers Dark Child. Now the last Album Full Moon, I played to death. I guess it will take a few more plays before I get used to this sound. The most hated song Necessary. The best song on the album and the trick to get you to buy the album Let's Talk About Our Love. I would find a friend that has a copy and you know the rest."
5,One of the most sleep on albums!,"This is album, is excellent. I sing it's praises every chance I get! This album was completely slept on. The lead single was one of the weaker of the tracks on the album, which says alot cause most people point it out as a hot track. She's got love songs, I'm over you songs, I'm back songs... everything. The best tracks are 10 and 12 Necessary and Say You Will. This album shows a grown up Brandy with new textures and vocal abilities... ranges displayed.**********************************Playable from front to back with no skips at leats 3 times in a row."
3,not worth the price,"I got this for my pregnant wife to help her sleep. After using it as the whole long pillow, she decided it wasn't that practical or useful, and really in the way of her comfort. She has since taken to using just one of the small detachable end pillows. We would have saved a lot of money by just buying a cheaper smaller pillow."
2,wake up with a cramped neck,"I should have headed other reviews suggestions. I have acid reflux and purchased another pillow by leacho (the Leachco Boomerest Angled Body Pillow)Leachco Boomerest Angled Body Pillow, Ivorythat was FABULOUS. This one however is too puffy & hard right away and leaves you with a cramp in your neck when you wake up. Not comfortable"
2,Nice...but cheaper version would have been as good,"The Grow to Sleep gives great support for sleeping comfortably during pregnancy. I like the elasticized middle portion for adjusting for the most comfortable position. What I do NOT like about the Grow to Sleep is that the 2 ends of the body pillow are too hard to use as a comfortable pillow. The pillow filling is tantamount to what is in a $5 drugstore pillow. I slept with my head on the end pillow portion about 2 nights, and kept waking with a stiff neck from the rock hard stuffing. I ended up taking off one end and just using the rest of the pillow (J shape) instead. This has worked well....but I would recommend saving yourself the extra money this pillow costs and just buy a cheaper J-shaped version."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This unit lasted almost 2 months before it would no longer dispense cold water. When I called the mfr. they told me it would cost 15.00 to ship a new unit, after I returned the old one which I no longer have a box for . The refrigerator does not keep anythng very cold. I have to remove the spill proof cap from my water bottle because it does not work with this unit and quickly put the bottle on before the water is spilled all over the floor. The Sunbeam unit I had before this was cheaper and lasted a year and a half. Don't waste your money."
3,Thought i was getting displayed water bottle with my order,"I thought i was getting the displayed water bottle with my order since there was no indication that the bottle was not included in the order. I can not even test the product until i buy the water bottle to run water throught the hot water compartment. I ordered this product on the 5th of May 2004 and received it by 25th of May 2004. I can not even be sure if it is going to work or not because the water bottle is absent. If i knew this fact, i should have ordered all elements required for the proper functioning of this product.Product composition fell below expectation."
3,harmless fun,"harmless fun -- john travolta and his wife - before she was his wife - kelly preston - in this fun flick where we get to explore life the ""way it should have been"" growing up. send two NY to the middle of Nebraska and they find they are living in the 50's before pleasantville ever thought of being a story! (but are they REALLY in Nebraska in the '50's...?"
3,Funny and a must see movie,When I was going to see this movie I first put it on and said this is funny but it is going to end up dumb. But it actually ended up being a pretty good movie. And I thought that was a newer movie like from the 80s and I was write but it is not to predictible well at least not as much as some movies are. i say if you need some fun or cherring up this is your movie.
2,boring,Rock should rock. This is derivative of the greats that came before them. Go get Goatsnake I and you'll see what I mean if you don't already own it.
1,I never received it to rate it,I wish I could get it so I could rate it. I have been charged for it but never received it.
5,Great.,"Unlike the poor fit of the case that came with the original S100, this one fits the S200 and beyond perfectly. In addition, the price is a good value."
3,This puzzle was missing pieces.,"Once we had the time to sit down to put this puzzle together, we were disappointed to find that there were pieces missing!"
3,Sometimes words say to much.,"I think the opera is great, I went and saw the four day opera in Sanfransico, and it ws really good. The only reason i bought this CD was because I never got to just hear the music, and that is part of enjoying anything that has music. I have to say that this CD is one of my favorites, it and Holst, The Planets. I fact at the next concert that I'm in we're doing a version of Das Reingold: Float Up To The Home Of The Gods, at my request of course. If you like the Opera you'll like this CD. And if you don't then you won't ever know that full Beauty of the Opera."
5,Great display of Wagner's versality.,"The ""ring"" With Words is a ""must"" for those who enjoy Wagner, and who relish in the themes of his Ring Cycle. This CD brings the themes of the Ring Cycle together in one peice, without the blaring of the individual pieces usually heard on various CDs or at symphony orchestra presentations."
1,Just what every kid wants... a SEVERED ARM.,"Don't waste your time or money with this pathetic shelfwarmer. Not only was the stretching power unpopular in the show, but this toy, which is really just Triassic Ranger's right arm, only recreates that most unenjoyed ability. Your children will hate you if you buy this for them."
1,Arm Extender,"Don't waste your money!!! This toy is a piece of junk! Arm does not extend well, does not pick up anything and it only make dumb sounds. It is also in the toy box collecting dust."
1,Dont waste your money! PLEASE,"Please do not bother wasting your valuable time or money! As with most of the Power Ranger Dino Thunder toys, this was also cheaply made, doesn't work well, huh, has no educational value whatsoever, and is now in a pile of other toys that were played with for no more than a day or two! My son gets frustrated because none of the toys work well or stay together! Avoid the frustration and disappointment."
5,Sturdy Simplicity,"Basic and sturdy with no moving parts to break. Perfect for heavy use and has a nice, clean look, too. I have one under each bathroom sink, in the kitchen and in the garage and have never had a problem. It also keeps a decent grip on the roll, which avoids unraveling."
3,Item is fine,"This product was easy to install. I has no moving parts so I expect it to last for quite a while. I am pleased with this product. However, I didn't appreciate the high cost of shipping the product to me. These shipping charges will be the deciding factor in future purchases."
5,GAME BOY ADVANCE SP- FLAME,"AHHH...WHAT COULD I SAY ABOUT THIS CONSEL IN ONE WORD...WONDERFUL!!!! THIS THNG HAS A BUILT IN LIGHT THAT HAS AN ON AND OFF SWITCH, IT FOLDS UP SO YOU CAN PROTECT THE SCREEN, AND I THINK PARENTS MAY ESPICALLY LIKE THIS FEATURE BESIDES THE KIDS, A RECHARGABLE BATTERY (saves alot of money on batteries)!!!! ALSO THE BATTERY LAST ALOT LONG THAN WHAT AMAZON.COM SAYS, THE LONGEST AMOUNT OF TIME THE BATTERY HAS LASTED FOR ME IS A GOOD 72 HOURS. I SAY THIS IS THE BEST GAME BOY THEY PUT OUT SO FAR BUT THATS JUST MY OPINIPON. SO GO ON AND BUY IT, I'VE HAD MINE A YEAR (as of November 3) AND I STILL LIKE IT ALOT."
4,blast from past,really fun little game that reminds me of the good old days when all you had was a mario or a yoshi!i got three of these for the kids because they love em on car rides. plus the games are not the gory bloody stuff you see all over modern game systems.
4,pretty cool but takes no batteries,the gba sp is quite inpresive it comes in lots of colors and all but if your on along road trip but evrey 15 to 20 hours it needs charging and cannot play it on trips it should have batteries because you can just put new ones in insted of waiting 10 hours in an equnox (chevy) unless i have a portible dvd player
2,Not so great,"The Gameboyadvance SP is good because it has feautures the GBA didn't.It has a built-in light, rechargable battery, and it folds up so you don't scratch the screen.The reason I don't like the sp is because its got the same graphics as the original GameboyAdvance, and sp didn't even come out with it's own games.So basiclly, your stuck just playing GBA games on the SP with a couple of better features..........."
2,BORING,"I'm sorry I don't agree with most of the reviewers. Although the book was easy to read, I found it to be slow-moving. I was so excited to finally read it but I couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. I loved the male character in the book, although for the life of me, I can't remember his name. I also loved the bonding that the sisters had. I think the AIDS tragedy wasn't developed enough. This book is one that I'll soon forget about."
3,Worth Reading,"I thought it was a little too wordy and descriptive, in the beginning, as if the writer was really trying to prove something, but as she toned it down and the actual story started to unfold, it was a pretty good read overall. This book touched on the real life subject of HIV, in somewhat of a love story..it provided a little education about it, and also gives you a view of life, from the perspective of someone who has it."
3,a little much??,"in all fairness, this was my first time to read this author, so I wasn't really sure what to expect.the language and situations were a little ballsy for what I would choose to read - but it is always good to be exposed to other genres.written with great insight and a manner in which does keep the reader involved and wanting to read more. Glad I read it... not sure I'll run out to buy her other works though."
5,Fantastic!!!,"My gave me this book when I ran out of something to read. I was weary at first, but figured a free book... why not! It was a slow start but this is now one of my favorite books! Definitely a must read!!"
4,good insight into today's times.,"Having read Pearls' nonfiction ""Mad at Miles"" several years ago; i am glad to see she is no longer angry. this book is an excellent choice to read with young adults to discuss the complexities of growing up among drugs, sex, and no opportunities."
4,"Great title, great story.","I read this novel in just a few days. It was humorous and serious, entertaining and and heartbeaking all at the same time. Ava Johnson, the protagonist, has just returned home to Idlewood after ten years of living the wild life in Atlanta. Although she plans to stay only the summer with her sister, Joyce, numerous events in both their lives sway her decision and she chooses instead to remain in her home town. Full of life and spunk, Ava is a delightful person to get to know and her sister, Joyce, the sort of woman we all wish we could be, passionate and courageous as well. If ever we are to become better as a human race, it will be because of people like these two sisters."
3,okay,"Okay book, purchased for a class as a requirement. Not bad as far at required readings go. Probably wouldn't have read on my own."
5,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll rejoice!","What looks like crazy, really is crazy, because it really is love... anyday, anytime, anywhere.Love is the world's most precious natural resource, yet it has almost becomes extinct in the face of crime, drugs, and AIDS. Pearl Cleage moves us from Atlanta to the small town of Idlewild, (known for its idle men and wild women). She unfolds its big problems within one summer. In the midst of the madness, there is love in the hearts of the people whose hearts are in Idlewild. They remember why they stayed or returned home... because it is truly where the heart is.You'll love this book!"
2,Eh...so-so,"I have read only three of Oprah's book club selections. I think I picked the wrong three. Wally Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"" was pretty good. ""Where The Heart Is"" was so-so. And this one was so-so as well. Do most of Oprah's choices contain the abuse of women and/or children? If so, I find that to be a depressing and disturbing pattern."
3,Good but just not what I expected,"This was a good novel all in all but, being that I heard so many good things about it I just expected too much. The character's were well developed and I like the story line about how after living a crazy life she came back home to see her roots and remember where she came from. But the fact that see still had sex after see was HIV postive was chilling to me. Even though see used protection I just could'nt get in to that whole scene.This was a good book, but just not what I expected."
5,Increadible...Touching and Funny,"This book was wonderful! Ada is very real. Disillusioned, yet hopeful, humorous yet sad, her conflicting nature is intriging. I loved this book and look forward to reading more from the author. I highly recommend it."
4,Eye opening experience!,I really enjoyed this book! It certainly opened my eyes to the realities of the world. This is a great book for discussion in book groups or to just read on your own. Great job Cleage!
4,A fun sad story of two sisters helping each other and others,"I read this book very fast. One: because it was a short book! And 2- it was just such a great interesting story! The one sister returns home from Atlanta, with AIDS to visit her sister, planning to just stay a short time. She becomes involved inher sisters generousity with the poor young girls of the town--ignoring the church re: birth control methods, etc. Especially after she takes in an unwanted crack baby. There's much more, including a love story. I really enjoyed the book & wasn't totally Depressed at the end!"
5,REAL,First off I'm not sure that the lady from OR understands real life. This book is wonerful! It lets a women with HIV tell it like it is. I read this book months ago and I still think back wondering what Ava is feeling like now. The people in this story were all so real. Loved It.
4,A honest 90's approach to living with HIV,"I was surprised that this book although centered around the central theme of living with Aids, didn't overpower the reader the subject.Pearl has brought to light the fact that most of us are still ""scared"" of Aids but also very ignorant to the facts surrounding the disease. It also shows that given an open mind and information that one can exist and co-exist with everyone while living with this. The thrust of the hypocricy of Christians was a good minor subject to touch upon also.I loved this book. It made one feel empathy versus sympathy for the main character. A job well done!"
2,Predictable and boring,"This book was so predictable! I chose to read it because it was on the Oprah's Book Club List. Throughout the book, I was wondering what Oprah could possibly say that was positive about this book. I knew what the ending would be half-way through the book. I will choose from amongst the books on Oprah's list more carefully next time. Reading this book was a waste of time. I kept hoping for it to get better, but it never did. Thank goodness it was not any longer, and therefore torturous, than it was!"
4,"Generally, a good read","I liked this book. I especially enjoyed the character of Ava, and her witty and insightful observations. My only quibble is with the character of Eddie -- I thought some of his actions were inconsistent (I'd explain in more detail, but don't want to give away the plot)."
4,A great first book.I'd recommend to everyone,"Ms Cleage has done a wondeful job creating characters that are sensitive and real. I felt this book gave insight into the emotional pain many people are living with daily ,as they deal with life. in the 90's. It may not be pretty ,but that's life. This book was a real pleasure as the characters,dealt with everything life dished them and continued to have a positve outlook and faith in themselves and their God."
5,Love Telarc CDs,I love Telarc movie theme song Cds and thought I would never find this one after they seemed to have discontinued it. I've been collecting their CDs for years and it is great to be able to find them here on amazon to try to complete my collection. Telarcs recording quality is always excellent and the prices on amazon are bargains. Thanks amazon and Telarc.
5,High Lonesome,I love this show. Louis Gossett Jr is a wonderful actor and brilliant in this and William Ficthner was the sheriff is just awesome. Thank you so much Amazon
4,"A little big, but the best I found.","The fannypack was pretty big, but it will work great for my 9 and 7 year olds. Lots of room to pack stuff. I still purchased one for my 3 year old, but it is very bulky on him. He will still enjoy it though. I think the product works well for ages 6 and up."
2,DC Universe gets cold!,"I was hoping this would be really good considering the talent involved. Kesel, Marz, Immonen, & McKone and all talents that I enjoy today. Looking back at their work here from the mid-nineties am glad their work has evolved. Here we are given the problem of something that eats the sun called the Sun-eater. Makes sense. However, the danger always seemed a little generic and not terrifying as it really would be. The book was also short considering the premise. I was disappointed by the overall ""hokeyness"" that turned me off of DC Comics back then. Overall, there is no real reason to check this out other than getting a look at some comics veterans early work."
4,Beware of Bounceback Express for Macbook Pro's with Intel chip,I sent my new Macbook Pro(Intel Pentium II) back twice to the factory and had it gutted to find the problem of it crashing. It turns out it is the Bounceback Express Software that this device comes with. The software is like a virus itself because it constantly is working to find updates. It would freeze up my cursor and scramble the keyboard lettering.As for this drive it works great with out the software and is very fast to upload using firewire. I would NOT put that evil software in your precious system. I also read on these reviews that some of these devices can have virusses inside so be weary of that.
4,Backup Hardware and Software,"The Seagate 300gb external drive is very compact, quuiet, easy to use and reliable. The third party software is fairly easy to use but has two drawbacks. The upgrade to a full version costs nearly half the price of the hardware and the reminder pop up is an annoying nucisance."
4,Avoid software,"This hard drive was well rated and I purchased it. I was doing well until I tried installing the enclosed program ""BounceBack Express"". This caused my brand new computer with Windows XP to lock up. I was able to retrieve most of my data but had to reinstall XP. When I tried BounceBack again, the same thing happened. This time I was able to use System Restore. The drive works flawlessly without the special software."
4,Good Product,I got my hard drive a few months ago. I has worked great for me since then. It's transfer are pretty fast and the double interface is great. The only thing I don't like is the disk automatically turns to stand-by if you don't use it for a certain amount of time and it takes like 5-10 seconds to turn on when you do need it. I guess this will probably make it last longer if its not in use all the time. I would recommend this product.
5,Best CD Ever Made,"This was the 1st cd I ever bought and money well spent. The music makes you fell like you are right there in the room, LIVE........ Can't get any better then this."
3,Nice Book,Nice book. To bad the pictures are all in b&W.;The entire book is a bit dated but all in all a good value. Happy Diving!
2,Very Basic.,"This is a very basic book on investing, only good for the newbie investor. Of course it's title, and it's positive outlook on actually making money on Canadian Stocks is maybe just what a Canadian needs to help them make some money on Canadian stocks!"
2,Did not meet expectations,"I bought this castle based on all the positive reviews I read about it. However, I feel I was mislead or had higher expectations. The box advertised 9ft x 9 ft. Once blown up the jumping area only measured 5 ft 6 inches. I measured every which was to find out where the 9 ft by 9ft came from. The only way I got even over an 8 ft measurement was when the castle was laid completely flat on the ground. Also, the side walls are pretty low. There was just enough room inside the castle for my 2 kids, who each weigh less than 45 pounds. I can't imagine 3 kids in the castle and noone getting hurt.I am glad many people enjoyed this product, but I am returning mine. I would recommend splurging for bounce houses that cost $50 - $75 more and getting a larger jump space. Lastly, the side of the castle only has a 5 ft. wall that easily collapses when jumped upon. Buyer Beware on this one!"
3,Safety,"We purchased this item and while the kids (ages 3 and 6) loved it, we found it to be quite dangerous. It is very easy for the kids to bump into eachother when there are 3 or more children playing in it. We also found that the safety instructions advise you not to use an extension cord for the fan, but the cord provided was not long enough to offer a safe distance from other objects. We ended up returning this to the store."
1,Sent Me The Wrong Book,He Send Me The Wrong Book It Was Supposed To Be The Night The White Deer Died And Instead He Sent Me Deer Diaries Very Upset!!
3,"too much description, not enough clear maps","I miss a simple map with all the hikes marked. You always have to search the one you need out of 24 detail maps. And exept for the cover no page is in colour. Don't get me wrong - the hikes in the book are nice ones. But I like it simple - with better coloured maps and just basic information about the hikes. An approx. duration of the hikes would be helpful, too."
5,Shadows of Evil,"I found the book to be fascinating probably because I know Adam Ford, and have been awaiting news of trial date or some other news about the case. Adam told me and others that he was related to Harrison Ford, and I saw no mention of this in the book. Could this be one reason for the gag order? Just Curious."
2,Boring.....,"Right off the bat you learn that this book is going to be incomplete and boring, due to the fact that the case has not yet gone to trial and a judge placed a gag order on all information and legal documents relating to this case. The author spends a lot of time making assumptions about the crimes as he has no access to any of the official documents and spends an inordinate amount of time trying to make a case for brain damage of the perpetrator due to an accident he sustained prior to the murders. It would have been a good book if he had waited until the case was dispensed and actually had some information to share."
3,Shadows Of Evil,"Good book with lots of information on this little known serial killer. I wanted this book to learn about what happened and his life a bit more because I live one town away from where he lived, and in the town of Eureka where he turned himself in. Gives lots of information, sometimes gets a bit slow in the way that they chose to write the story but all in all a good informative read."
3,adorable but small,i was surprised at the size of this product. i didn't note it's size prior to buying it. i don't know if it would've affected my choice to purchase as it is very visually pleasing. my son is 14 mos but still doesn't seem too thrilled with the toy. i wish that the center rod was fixed to the base. it just always seems to be in several different pieces.
2,Author appears to lack first-hand knowledge of snake keeping,"The book is written for the bare naked amatuer and seems to be a compilation of info gathered from other books, magazines, and the internet rather than any real first hand knowledge. Further, the sources she cites are, in my opinion, not the best ones she could be using. I would venture a guess that she didn't know anything about snake keeping prior to writing this book. Other info in the book is downright wrong such as when she says that probing a snake (to determine sex) is ""not always conclusive""; in fact this is the only conclusive way to sex a snake. In general, I found that the book skipped around on subjects too much and seems to be written more for younger readers."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR..... CRAP!,"I have purchased TWO of these due to the fact that 2-door Grand Am's have such large windows, they keep breaking! Spend the extra money and get the heavy duty metal ones. These cheap plastic supports twist and then break inside the door. It's a pain the butt to keep fixing! Save yourself the time and don't bother with these."
1,Not to impressed,"this regulator didn't work. The clips kept popping out and then to get my money back, I had to pay for shipping to return it. I think the company is reputable. But return policy should be better."
1,Not the same scent...,"Apparently Revlon changed the formula for Jean Nate After Bath Splash, and it is very different from the ""original."" I phoned Revlon and this was confirmed. I don't like the new scent, and I will not buy it again. I don't want to give it even 1 star, but it seems I have to enter something!"
4,Better than I expected,"Picture is excellent especially the 1080i signal. A bit blurry if you get too close. Best viewed from 8' or more. Sound is adequate but I can't really hear any difference with the ""surround sound"" feature. Shipping was no problem as I had the unit one week after I ordered. I am using a component cable that came with my DVR and I don't think I could ask for a better picture."
2,Worked Flawlessy for 16 month then.....,"This TV worked beautifully for 16 months. Nice picture. I didn't get an extended warranty since I believed Samsung to have a good track record, no moving parts, etc. However, 4 months after the warranty expired it developed a fixed horizontal line (mostly white) across the screen on all sources. Samsung did nothing but recommend a repair shop. Repair shop said that entire screen would have to be replaced, so not worth the cost to repair. Bottom line is get an extended warranty on expensive electronics. Learned my lesson."
5,LCD Winner,Samsong got it right with this one. Excellent HD picture on this nice wide screen. Have had the TV for a month and no problems. Delivery service was very good. I would buy this unit again.
4,pretty good,"bought this TV like a month and half ago, TV's working great so far... found a couple of dark pixels, but they say it's usual.but my delivery service sucked.. they just dropped it in front of the building, no unpacking..I think the price is good.. initially bought it for $2,400, the price went down TWICE in less than a month, so Amazon gave me a refund."
4,N.I.C.E...,"As most of the reviews say, but one short fall is that the built-in ATSC tuner does not have QAM tuner, so not able to watch unscrambled local DTV channels... Other than that, awesome pictures via HDMI/DVI. Sound is so so, but okay."
1,Not a good TV at all,"Well one would think Samsung is a trusted name, but when it comes to LCD TV...one wonders. I bought this TV brand new from Amazon on January 10th 2007. I was very amazed since it was my first LCD TV. At first it worked very nicely, although I had some problems searching for signals for the DVD and the VCR. After two months owning this TV the picture went black, only sound and no picture. I called SAMSUNG and took it to repair. After 2 months, they told me that the LCD PANEL was burned and the PCB main was not working. I live in Caracas, Venezuela and since I bought it in the USA, the warranty is useless. I just lost the money invested. Thanks SAMNSUN"
4,spiderman stool,I bought this stool even though there was no picture or general description. When I got it the soft top of it was great along with the picture. There are 4 small plastic rings on the bottom of the legs for traction. One was broke but Im not sending it back. My son has everything spiderman in his room and really liked it. He uses it in his older brothers room when he plays video games. I would buy another one just so he could have a set.
3,GR59A Baby George Rotisserie,"A very fine product with just one set back as far as I am concerned.After attaching a 5 lb chicken in the rotisserie and starting the cookingprocess, each time the rotisserie was about half way through its cycle,it would slip off the gear that propells it, and it would not get anydirect cooking heat for about half of the chicken. This problem wouldnot be hard to fix in my estimation."
4,I cooked 2 cornish hens...,and they came out really good. Little season salt and pepper and that was all it needed. The only thing I didnt like was i could not seem to get the legs of the hens to stay together to well and they kept flopping a little and hitting the side. The piece that goes thru the birds that makes it go around seemed like it wasnt secure. It was - it held 2 birds but I was waiting for it to fall apart and drop to the bottom.The cornish hens were very tasty and the rotisserie is very easy to clean.
4,not complete,"I had a Baby George for a number of years and really liked it, but I lost mine in the flood this past summer so wanted a replacement. The rotisserie arrived new, as advertised, but it was advertised to come in the original packaging, which it did not, and it was incomplete. The instruction book was missing, as were the four skewers. The rotisserie works fine, and fortunately I had the instruction book from my previous Baby George. And that's what clued me in to the fact that there should have been four skewers with the rotisserie."
1,Didn't work right out of the box,"I unpacked the Baby George, plugged it in. The Digital display lit up. Set it to rotate. Motor didn't work. Nothing more to say."
3,No replacement parts,"I bought this both for my Daughter and myself, less than a year ago. While we both love it, there is one major draw back; you cannot buy replacement baskets, etc. I use my rotisserie quite often and I am in the need of a new basket. Sadly I will probably replace the George Foreman Rotisserie this year with one from Ronco, as with a Ronco Rotisserie you can buy extra baskets, etc., The big dissapointment with the George Forman one is that it is not even a year old and I'm going to replace it."
1,Ugh,"Amazon.com recommended I would like this CD, so I went and bought it. I like bands like Seether, Chevelle, Bush, Staind, Cold, etc. I hate this CD. It is all in a major key (happy music). ""Poem"" is remotely okay, but that is it. Unless you love Taproot, avoid this CD. Please excuse me while I go shoot it with my step-dads shotgun."
2,ehh..,"What happened!?!? Gift WAS a lot better... and as a reviewer said they are kind of following in Nonpoint's footsteps..nowhere even close to their old heavyness--instead, that heaviness has been replaced by annoying harmonizing in almost every single song and simply put a lack of quality. Even in their hit song ""Poem"" it's easy to see that they've lost a lot of what made them an awesome band. For now, everyone who hasn't heard Gift, check out ""Again & Again"" and ""I"". Sorry Taproot...loved your guys's old stuff, but I'm not diggin the whole getting softer thing. Better luck next time."
2,Gift is the better albulm,"Taproot is truly an amazing band, as evident through their debut release. I am sad to say however that their style changed on ""welcome"". unlike many fans, this album does not make me dislike them or anything of that sort because they really do have a lot of talent. however, ""gift"" is a much better albulm and i sincerely wish they would have made something a little more similar."
4,This is the good stuff,"Great texture, creative songwriting and vocals make ""Welcome"" an essential hard-rock album of 2002. Get on the bus now, 'cuz these guys are breaking out, and by the time their next album comes out, Taproot will be in the forefront of the metal scene."
1,Only one good song,"I made a mistake by buying this CD, trust me when I tell you there is only one good song on this entire CD its 'Poem,' that's the reason I got the CD. I basically copied 'Poem' and took the CD back to the store and traded it in. Don't buy this CD if you like 'Poem,' just go and download it."
2,Cute teenybop pop music,"Nothing groundbreaking in any way with this music, but fun teenybop pop music nontheless. Cute stuff, but hardly classic."
4,Great cd (more like 4.25 stars out of 5),"Taproot's latest cd is great. In a market where no music is completely original, Taproot comes very close. And what seperates there from other bands of this genre is the incredible voice of the lead singing. The songs are tight and the lyrics are deep. I listen to the whole cd without skipping any tracks, however, Mine and Like are not quite as good as the rest. My favorites on the album include Poem, Breathe, Dreams and When. I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants an album that has some heavy guitar riffs without a lot of screaming."
2,heard it all before,"The operative word here is ""derivative."" Their name is appropriate because they certainly ""tap"" the ""roots"" of bands that went before them."
2,...Taproot...,"Taproot's latest release ""welcome"" sounds nothing like their previous release ""gift""... Taproot doesn't even sound like the same band. They seem to have lost their unique heavy sound that made you want to get up and JUMP! There is only one song on this cd that has that old taproot sound (poem) and that's about it. There are a few catchy songs, but not many. The cd is real slow paced...First of all, the cd isn't heavy... The drumming that was so impressive on ""gift"" is now gone, the super-tight guitar riffs are gone, and to add to the huge disapointment are the vocals. The vocals on ""gift"" were nothing less than amazing. What happened!!! The singer hardly even screams on this cd, and when he does scream they sound very distant.""Welcome"" is a very forgetable release. I find it to be a chore trying to get through the entire cd in a single listening. If you're a hardcore Taproot fan you will understand."
5,This is the version to have....,"Don't waste your time on the Steve Martin movie version, which is a simplified, bowlderised version re-worked for 'American tastes'.Watch this BBC mini-series which is a British television masterpiece. OK, it will not appeal to all, but if you fancy something completely original, superbly produced and performed,and with a unique and very British 1930s atmosphere, this is for you ! This was the series that made Bob Hoskins a major star, and launched his movie career, and he is superb! Intelligent viewers will love it - idiots won't !"
2,Leaky Bags,I am very dissapointed with this product. I have frozen over 100 bags of milk. Some where they were laid out flat some where they weren't. I realeased the air out of all the bags. I have begun using this milk and I put it in the fridge the night before. 7 out of the 12 bags I have thawed have leaked. This is very upsetting to me. It is important to me that my son gets breastmilk and when this happens I have to supplement with formula as I don't always produce enough. I have concerns of contamination therefore I don't use a bag that has leaked. This company should be ashamed.
1,they leaked. they ruined my stash.,"I've pumped and frozen for two children now, for a year and a half each time.With my first, all the bags I froze worked just fine. However, the Lansinoh bags we have in the freezer have all leaked when thawed. I have used them according to all the directions. They're not over-filled or bumped around, they are just shoddily made. They seem fine for refrigerated milk that isn't frozen, but every bag we've used from frozen milk has leaked. It's an awful mess. Even if Lansinoh offered me new bags, it wouldn't help, because it took so long to build that freezer stash of leaky bags that can't be replaced."
1,The bags leaked,I would not buy these bags. I have WASTED my hard work in pumping milk. These bags leak. Find another bag!
1,Every second bag leaks after defrosting along sides - bad quality,"These bags are of consistently poor quality - I bought a few boxes of them, and stored quite a lot of milk in the freezer - now as I thaw or defrost them in any possible way - most of them leak before you can pour milk into bottles - what a waste."
1,Lansinoh Breast Milk Storage bags,"mom n' dad...do not buy these type of bag..i bought it, its big n' look good, but when i freeze the milk its crack the bag open...7/10 bag i used is cracked open...best bag i used so far is the Medela..."
2,I wish I'd read the reviews before stocking up!,I should have checked the reviews before purchasing TWELVE 25-count boxes! I would have seen that others had issues with bags leaking at the seems and I would have purchased a different brand so as to not waste all of that nourishment and hard work!
4,Perfect for countertop,"Been using this for 3 months now and have no leaking or any problems yet. The best way to get rid of the plastic taste is to boil water and pour it into the tank and flush it out through the spout. After I did a gallon of hot water, the taste went away. The tank is small so after you dispense 2 cups of cold water, the fan comes on. I'm sure in the summer you will run out of cold water quickly if you have several people using it. But if you like to drink your water in room temperature, this is great to have on your counter. Note that i had a dispenser from Poland Spring (more expensive one) and the water tank was aluminum. This water cooler has a plastic tank."
4,great item,It was perfect for what we wanted. The only thing that I got discouraged with on the beginning was the taste of plastic in the water but out went away after some time of use. now it's perfect!
3,"Slow, but Works","The other reviews are correct in the fact it only chill one 8 oz container of water an hour. Other than that, it works fine. Great for low usage and where space is a premium."
1,What a waste of money!,"I purchased the cold water dispenser. Read the instructions (and unfortunately other reviews AFTER I purchased it) and prepped the unit with vinegar and water to ""supposedly"" get rid of the refrigerant taste or whatever chemical they used to manufacture. Never could get the taste gone. Plugged the unit in and 10 minutes later heard a little sizzle and a popping noise and then the smell of burnt wires. Customer service was horrid. Was told I would have to ship back to manufacturer. Finally gave up and threw the unit away. Don't waste your money!!"
2,Good price but...,"Bought this cooler in Feb, by April a seal went out and it started leaking water. Haier offered to replace for $15 or let me take it to a repair center. I took it to the center in the intrest of helping local business and costing Haier as much as possible for a faulty product. Other then that, my only complaint is the difficulty in puting a bottle on it without getting water everywhere. (it has a small opening on top that water splashes out of) The seal went out again 2 weeks after getting it back from the repair center. Haier's customer service has stated that they will call me back on 10 different occasions and never has. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE, CHECK OUT THE WWW.BBB.COM BEFORE BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY."
5,Make This Your FIRST Yoga Book,This book was recommended by our local yoga instructor. The spiral binding makes the book lie flat. I really like the split pages with the practices on one side (very wide range from beginner to advanced) and the poses on the other. Arrangement is very simple and straightforward. The teacher kept this book out as a constant reference--which was a good enough recommendation for me--and she is a certified Iyengar instructor with years of practice.
5,Great Yoga Manual,"This is a great book! Many yoga books that I've purchased describe only a few sequences. Others describe only very long (time-consuming) sequences. This book details over 30 sequences ranging in time from 10 minutes to 90 minutes in length. It is organized to make it easy to select a sequence according to different criteria - length of sequence, theme (e.g., ""opening""), or body area emphasized. Descriptions of the asanas are very detailed, and each comes with a description of the advanced pose and easier variations. And there is quite a bit of other useful information also, including suggestions on forming your own sequences, illustrations showing the location of various muscles and other body areas, etc."
5,Functional and good looking,"I purchased this to go in our hallway near the garage door to hang up my toddler's coats and backpack for preschool. It looks great, has a narrow shelf so it doesn't protrude too much in to the hallway. I like that it has a mirror so I can check myself as I dash out the door and the hooks are double hooks so hats or mittens can drape along with the coordinating jacket. The color is a rich dark brown and since we don't have anything else in that space yet, there has been no trouble coordinating it with other peices, as other reviewers have stated. It functions perfectly in the space for which I designated it."
4,Good Action Packed Movie!!!,"Kevin Sorbo has done an outstanding job here. Very well paced, acted, and directed movie of a former sheriff forced into a situation in which he has to defend his family from a drug cartell because his FBI wife is involved in an investigation, but, there is a leak in the task force. It must be dealt with, but on the sheriff's terms, in down home justice!!! Very well worth a watch! Violence, Adult Situations, Some adult language."
3,Mellow disc...,"Well, we've been saturated with Kanons left and right. This one is played not by some scrawny-sounding, miniscule chamber ensemble with one instrument to a part, but by a glorious symphony orchestra, given the big romantic treatment in a slightly bastardized arrangement (violas going ""plunk plunk plunk"" was not in Pachelbel's head--or manuscript). Regardless, it's given such a heady performance, who cares? The shorter pieces are nicely done. The playing is superb, the sound very natural. The Serenade for strings represents a pedestrian interpretation with beautiful playing. Want a good serenade? This is fine; if you want an exceptional one, look elsewhere. However, it's a perfect disc for less-than-serious listening, and I've enjoyed it a lot."
5,sunset song,Not a novel for everyone but since it was first published in the early thirties it has become a classic of sorts. It is lyrical in language but not easy for everyone to follow since it is written in the Scottish country dialect of the early 20th century. For it's time it is very frank with regard to sexual matters.I believe it is a minor classic.
2,Salty and gross,"I saw Rocco on the Tony Danza Show hyping his book, so I bought it. With the exception of the Panini, every recipe I made was really gross. They use so many processed foods that it just tastes way too salty. Skip this one."
5,FABULOUS,"Every household should own ""Rocco's Five Minute Flavor""I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!GREAT BOOK ROCCO!Thanks for simplifying my life.Liz HernandezTELS"
2,Im tired of the newer ones,"I liked the first SVU books but now, the story is just... well... bad. All of them. They're old close friends are close anymore. Nina and Liz arent like before. I personally dont like the whole Liz-Jess-Neil-Sam roomate thing. Everythings changed [...]. I liked it when Elizabeth was with Tom and Jessica was with Nick. Well, Elizabeths changed too. It seems like all she ever thinks about now is losing her virginity. The sex stuff is getting old."
1,this book is pro-Chinese propaganda,"At first I was not aware of the author's point of view. He has spent extensive time in China and Tibet, and has witnessed many of the upheavels. However, I was amused at first at the innaccuracy of much of his information, and then became disappointed, as I realized that he rather strong anti-religious bias. This bias is not conducive to understanding any aspect of Tibetan life and culture. I would advise against reading this book unless you are curious of the official stance of the Chinese Communist Party."
2,Mixture of live and re-recordings,"This CD contains a mixture of live recordings and studio re-recordings. The re-recordings are very similar to the originals, but some of the live performances are very different. Only for the avid Tommy James fans.Warning - if you see this one in the store, there are no indications on the cover that these are not the original recordings! It is packaged to make you think this is a ""greatest hits"" compilation, but none of the songs are the original hits! Very deceptive!!"
2,Don't Like It,"I was really disappointed with this DVD. Christi seems nice and like a fun instructor, but the moves are just ridiculous. I like step that has a mix of high & low intensity aerobics, plus some strength building moves. Her basic routine is ok, but in my opinion she just ruins it by trying to get too frilly & fancy. So many twirls & spins. That doesn't do anything except make you dizzy. I found myself creating my own steps as I went along. For example, while she would do figure 8's, pivots, and circles...I would do squats, lunges, or knee raises. I also found some of her moves to be too fast paced & switched around too much which is hard on the knee joints. It was pretty repetitive too, so I found it a bit boring. I really wish I didn't waste my money on it. Why can't Tammilee Webb make her ""Buns of Steel"" on DVD? I loved her step workouts. I guess I'll try some of the other DVD's on Amazon."
5,Doggy toys,if you have a small dog then get these. they are tons of fun for puppy and small breeds. my dog loves them.
2,Warning on these Bones,These use to be entertainment for my dogs - warning that you do not let them have them 24 / 7. One of my dogs broke off the top of his back molar and these were only bones I give my dogs.
3,The Dogs Are Enjoying Them,"I know that my dogs have always enjoyed them in the past, but the bones that I received seem to be smaller than I thought they would be for a medium dog. My medium dogs have been enjoying them, but I just have to observe them a little closer than usual due to being small."
5,My dogs love 'em!,"Really the best review I can give. I am very pleased with the price and the variety offered in this 3 pack, but my dogs are in absolute heaven. Great buy. Get them for your favorite four-legger!"
5,Great Chew Bones!,I have 3 miniature dachshunds that love to chew and always destroy all of their toys. The nylabones are great!! They have chewed on them since Christmas and have hardly made a dent in them :). These are their new favorite toys!!
3,Not worth the money...,I bought this bag about 7 months ago and use it everyday. The plastic laminate is cracked on the corners and the strap is beginning to come loose from the bag. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it.
4,"Nice, relaxing Christmas music!","I heard one of the songs on an ez/Jazz station and had to have it. A Christmas Music traditionalist, I don't normally experiment with a ything beyond the standards but this fits nicely with a quieter mood, dinner and such!"
5,Connecting with Christmas,"Mary Bozeman Hodges has crafted a refreshing collection of stories which explore how human connections frame our understanding of the Christmas season. Read this charming volume and you will make your stomach ache with laughter, draw your breath in sharp surprise, blink your eyes to clear their tears, and thoroughly enjoy the time you spend with a compelling storyteller."
5,Practice testing = success,"I teach an SAT Prep course and have learned from experience that after learning the skills, practice testing is the most effective way to raise those SAT scores. The eight practice tests in the back of the book are key. Best book, mainly because it's from the College Board, the people who MAKE THE TEST! Doesn't get any better than this. Look for SullivanPrep, the best skills book on the market, to become available on the Web soon!"
4,Necessary Evil,"As we all know, The College Board is evil. However, we still need to give them our money and take the SAT if we want to go to a good school. So, to get a good score, you need to get this book. As it says on the cover, these are real questions by the people who actually write the test. Once you do a bunch of these, it becomes very predictable. It would be nice if they could give accurate scores at the end of the tests, instead of those ridiculous ranges, but whatever. My tutor, David Storper, helped me interepret the results, and explain the questions I couldn't get. If you live in the DC area, you schould work with him...[...]. He's really cool and knows what he's talking about."
2,Official SAT Study Guide,Just about every page in the math section of this book has the problems completed. Fortunately it was done in pencil so I can erase it. Not what I expected from the description.
4,Another SAT Tool,"Bought this for grandson, a senior in High School, starting to prepare for his SAT test. Arrived in a timely manner in New condition. Sorry for late submission of feedback."
2,No explanations!??,"This book comes in handy because it has great tips and sources coming right from the creator of the SAT's and also tells you what to expect on test day. The only problem is that it gives no explanations for the answers.There are explanations on the sample questions only, but there are none on the practice tests(there are eight practice tests). It is so frustrating, especially in the math section, don't just tell me the answer is ""B"", explain to me WHY it is ""B"" and HOW to solve the problem. If you want an effective and easy to understand study guide, I recommend ""11 Practice tests for the SAT's and PSAT's"" by the princeton review. That one actually explains the answers for every single question(both math and English) in the book. You can buy the college board's if you want great tips but don't rely on it for your practice tests because its not going to help."
5,great hostess gift,I love to give Food for Talk as a hostess gift. It is a great ice breaker when visiting another family.We also like to use it when we have company for dinner.
5,conversation starter,"This pack of thought-provoking questons has really improved the dinnertime discussions at our house. After being married for 19 years, I thought I knew everything about my husband. Surprisingly, these questions have started conversations about issues we had never discussed. I would recommend this item for any family."
3,Not so hot...,"Well this was a nice fun book. I can't say I much enjoyed any of the characters or the setting of the story. Nor can I say I enjoy how the aliens were portrayed, they were pure fodder and almost put up no fight at all to the human and predator onslaught. I did think that a lot of the predator expansion was interesting. As it told you more about the predator way of life. That's why I wouldn't call this so much an Aliens Vs. Predator book as it's a Predator Vs. Humans and some poor unsuspecting aliens get tossed into the mix. I do feel however that the writer kinda turned the predators into somewhat of a klingon ripoff, but not so much, the predators in this book are just as hardcore as their film counterparts. A couple predators in particular are a LOT more hardcore than their film counterparts.Over all this isn't as good as Predator: Cold War or Aliens: Earth Hive, but it's not nearly as bad as Aliens: Genocide so I say this is pretty well worth the money pick up a copy soon."
3,NOT TOO SHABBY,"I liked the characters of this book, though I would have liked more Predator dialogue. The Predator guy, Dachande, really put the movies in perspective. The Aliens were misrepresented: obviously Steve and Stephani Perry didn't notice or care about how more cunning and deadlier Aliens are compared to Predators."
5,The #1 in Aliens V.S. Predator,"This book is the best out there, I bought it in 95 or 94, and have had to since buy a new copy due to reading it so often, and letting others read it."
4,"Was for my younger brother, he liked it","Was for my younger brother, he liked it and put it together fairly easily. He used it for his school project."
5,great laptop bag,"For me its ok that not entirely made of leather, i mean come on just on the price tag u can figure that out, its really comfortable and great for laptop carryin, no too bulky and very light.."
4,"Good, but...","The shipping was good, the only thing is that i thought this was all leather, and it turns out only the front is, not the back or the inside, its great, lloks good, but i was surprise when i saw the back :S"
2,Its OK,These earphones were really cheap. Now the price is up than last time.($7.00 up) I dont like these becaues they have small volumes. If I listen to my Zune it takes up the batteries because I have to put it loud. I dont recommend it since the price is gone UP HIGH.
2,Get what you pay for!,"These are very inexpensive, so you can't complain when they suck! Don't expect much...they fall out of the ears, etc! If you just need a VERY CHEAP PAIR OF EARBUDS THAT YOU DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING FROM...THESE MIGHT BE THE ONES!"
4,Perfect for Bass,"I've always used this type of pick for playing bass - I like the material and the thickness is just right. What else can you say about a pick, yet it's a very important tool - very personal. This is my favorite for bass."
1,gets a one cause I can't put in negative numbers,"I found out about these guys from a sampler CD that came with rotting christ (who actually is a good band) and the one song on the sampler was good but when I bought the C.D. the rest of the songs were garbage, the guys vocals on most of the songs make him sound like he should be singing along side justin timberlake, but it's worse because it is advertised like heavy metal, don't buy this if your into heavy metal"
3,wrist band too small,"Wrist band is too small for an adult man. It was smaller than any watch I have gotten before. I replaced it with a similar velcro watch band from a dept store, but an extra long size. I bought it for occasional use to try and see watch in low light situations like concerts in an auditorium. Watch seems ok. It's electric. I don't know how difficult replacing the battery will be when it's time."
3,"Though worthy of being read, the story has some weak spots.","I read a novella form of ""Where the Sea Used to Be"" in Bass's ""The Sky, The Stars, The Wilderness"" and I liked the short version better. Where Bass's lyric prose is tight and to the point in his novellas, the novel version of WTSUTB has beautiful descriptive passages but some undeveloped characters. There is little dialogue and page after page of omniscient explanation. It works on some levels, but not on others. The journal entries were written in a tedious, pretentious voice--I think that they ask too much of the reader.I still want to read everything Bass has written, but for such a long form, he should keep in mind that pace is important too."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because the titles of each section made the book seem worth while. Each time I read a section I was disappointed in the content. Not in-depth enough and not enough explanation. Each section that was explained used new jargon that hadn't been explained previously.While the book may be somewhat of a good reference for someone who already knows about betacam camerawork, it seems to be a waste of time for one trying to actually learn the material."
2,fiyah mon needuh lightuh mon,"clearly the worst album of his last three or four. with free up, mr. bailey isn't even touching the bar set by his past three cds, standing on his tip toes, on a foot stool. this is not the quality i expect from capleton. no boom sound here, save track 10. and check this, ""that day will come"" from reign of fire, sounds exactly like ""small world,"" on this one. fans deserve better."
4,And now banderas is Muslin!!,"You know the video it is great!! but not because Banderas, the ""vikings"" really convinced me about their mission in the movie, their strength, their wild costums, even about their extreme masculinity, and their brotherhood among themselves. Banderas is just there, needless to say, the movie is to make the Muslins look good, but Banderas I believe acted really bad, and did not fullfill his muslin character. I don't know what this guy is going to do in the future, but he really needs money, or Melanie forced him to take any movie available, I followed Banderas since ""Mujeres al borde de la locura"" and this guy takes any character, in any movie. from insecure young guy, in ""mujeres""... ... in other unspeakable movie, to a Muslin in this one. Don't get me wrong the movie was great, but Banderas made me upset."
1,Der 13. Aufguss,"Man nehme einen renommierten regisseur (die hard), einen erfolgreichen drehbuchautor (jurassic park), einen einigermassen bekannten schauspieler und ein riesenbudget... fertig ist der kassenschlager! Leider funktioniert das nicht immer so ganz, wie dieser film beweist. Eine schon zum hundertstenmal aufgegossene story (die sieben samurai), miese schauspieler (banderas war auch schon besser, aber wo bloss?), schlechte special-effects (noch schlimmer als die haie in deep blue sea), und das alles so ermdend in szene gesetzt, dass man am ende froh ist, den abspann erreicht zu haben. Mein tip: schaut euch den trailer an, denn der ist gut gemacht."
3,Clever retelling of Beowulf,"If you can remeber the basics of beowulf from highschool than the plot of the 13th warrior will come as no surprise to you. Just compare the 13 (surprise!) acts in beowulf to the 7 acts in the film. Beowulf must defend Hrothgar just as the men defend the town of the film. Beowulf not only defets Grendel but Grendel's mother as well , who by the way lives in a watery cave. Clever theory on who the beowulf POET realy was and the actual events that could have happened."
4,thrillling and excitment in a dvd,"Well this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I would recommend this to any one. It is fast and exhilarating that keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The only problem that I had with the movie was that it could have been longer it was very good and the plot just needed juiced up a little bit. I just thought in the end there should have been something added it just seemed to stop when there should have been more to go. As I was watching this movie I could many similarities between this movie and the poem Beowulf. Some of the characters in the movie have the same name and play the same part as the people that were in the poem Beowulf like hrothgar, bovine that played in the movie was the equivalent of to Beowulf in the poem and Grendel would have been the same as the bear people. I just want to say this was a great film that is good for any who likes adventure and a little bit of gore should go out and buy this movie."
4,Very good but too short.,"I have just received & viewed my copy of this movie (DVD widescreen) I while I must agree with the 'professional' reviewer that too much was edited out, in reading some of the other reviews it seems that they missed that this movie is based on Michael Chrichton's book ""Eaters Of The Dead"", which is based on Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan's memoirs, i.e., it's based on a real story! Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan was (is?) a historical figure and while the movie may have simularities to other stories so does any other movie with the possible exception of ""Being John Malkovich"".The cinematography is great and the soundtrack phenomenal! It's just that in trying to get the time down and make it more of an action movie, they edited too much of the story out making it seem jerky in places."
4,Favorite film,"The 13th Warrior is one of my favorite movies. I read the book and was not dissappointed with the movie. The casting was remarkable. I don't buy many videos for my collection, but this one is definitely ""gotta have"". Every time I watch it I find new details I missed before. The score is also great."
3,What the hell is this?,"When oh when did the Vikings ever go to Iraq?When did the Vikings ever fight Cavemen?How does an Arab learn a Norse language sitting around a campfire?How does an Arab design a cutlass from a two-handed Viking sword?And for the record, that was the world's UGLIEST dog."
1,the cover is attractive,"Poor acting,Antonio diappointing,plot a little thin on the ground.The packaging was nice.I feel I deserve a reward for wathcing this film"
2,"Not Bad, Some Good Gore","Not a bad movie but one you wonder why they bothered to make. Antonio Banderas plays the title role. Lots of good gore, though."
3,Good adventure film,"Your run of the mill story about an 10th century Arab expelled from the caliph's court at Baghdad for looking at one of the women of his harem and going to Scandinavia to help a Viking kingdom resist the raids from a cannibalistic tribe. Except there are not that many movies with that theme. Based on Crichton's short novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" (Crichton reportedly had a hand in the direction of the movie), this is an old-fashioned adventure movie. Crichton made the book as a blend from the real chronicles of an Arab traveler in the land of the Norsemen with the well-known story of Beowulf. The movie blends these two sources greatly and you are likely to go through a good time watching this DVD (if you can't stomach violence, though, you might be better off skipping it). And in how many Hollywood movies you get to see a Muslim play the good guy?"
1,13th Warrior DVD,"If it weren't for the conspicuously missing plot in this film - I would have really enjoyed it. All the gore, action and good hearted testosterone just couldn't save it for me. I think Banderas gives a great performance and every Viking plays out their roles fittingly - but it felt I was wandering aimlessly from one battle to another.The DVD transfer is excellent, and the sound quality is great too, but the disc offers no extras, and certainly doesn't pump life into such a disappointing film."
4,Antonio Banderas does a great job,"in this film. My husband and I truly did not know whether we would enjoy this film, but found ourselves riveted to the couch. The storyline was not predictable, and the honor and courage of the Northmen and the Arab was very moving. Yes, this movie could very easily have been longer with more character development. But perhaps the end result paid off in the movie's involving pace."
4,...not every man truely lives,This was an excellent movie! In the same style as Brave Heart but not as long. I hope that other people don't expect too much from it though. Holes in the plot must be forgiven in order to get a good feeling out of the film as a whole. The characters are powerful and the message of past culters can still be heard. The action draws you into the story and then you have to read the book to get the rest. A must see if you are a person who reads the book afterwards.
3,Great battle scenes,"This movie was packed from beginning to end with great battle scenes and good action. The only problem was that the development of the characters was lacking and some plotlines went unfinished leaving me a bit confused.This film started out strong, but by the end I noticed that it went nowhere in alot of areas. The movie could have used a good fleshing out in some areas. Not a bad movie, but one that could have been great."
3,"Northmen, rage and Valhalla","Good movie, lots of sword-fighting and mutilated bodies... if you like fantasy/God movies with a twist then this one is for you. The story itself could have been better... but see it with open eyes dont be a critic and enjoy."
2,Storyline was weak,The movie lacks a strong storyline and I thought it wandered without focus. I did think that some of the characters were interesting but since their adversaries were not developed the sense of accomplishment by the protagonists was not truely appreciated.
4,Left Me Craving for More,"""The 13th Warrior"" is a very fast-paced (for the most part), entertaining, and wonderfully shot film. But, regretfully, when the credits started rolling I was left with a lot of questions that were never answered. At various points throughout this film, we (the audience) are introduced to a few intriguing subplots and a very vague back-story on Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Banderas). These ""introductions"" ultimately seemed like a joke was being played on me to tease me into thinking I was going to be allowed to delve deeper into Fahdlan's experiences and his past. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film immensely and recommend it to anyone looking for a film with extremely well done fight scenes and incredible performances from some actors and actresses you may have never heard of. Besides Banderas, of course, who's performance was outstanding as well. I only wish McTiernan would have let us see more of him and his adventures. :-)"
5,One of my new favorite bands!,"Drawn by their website touting a ""new mambo revival,"" I first saw this fabulous Colorado Latin/lounge/exotica combo in New Orleans. Their live show is a bacchanale of epic proportions, and this CD did not leave my player for months after my return home, even after I had memorized all the words (even the Spanish ones, phonetically!) Are they the most ""authentic"" Latin band out there? No, but if, like me, you think Xavier Cugat can co-exist with Martin Denny, The Hot Club of Paris and a splash of surf guitar, these guys and gal are one of my very favorite new bands. Unequivocally recommended to fans of Bio Ritmo, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Combustible Edison and Brave Combo's ""No No No Cha Cha Cha"" CD."
3,Good for the $$... You get what you pay for,"I don't udnerstand what the other reviewer was complaining about. This is a great functional microwave. For $30 shipped, no complaints. No digital input buttons for time, but a dial instead, but no big deal. Rotating dish, power level, all you need is there.My only complaint is that it doesn't light up when you open the door, only when it's actually cooking does the light go on. Not a good design there."
3,WESTERN,"Not bad for a western mystery, not exactly my favorite but okay. The classic western writers are still hard to beat."
4,"80s fans, pay attention!","From song to song on this CD, I'm hearing echoes of Tears for Fears, The The, The Smiths, and a number of other influences. If you're a fan of classic 80s alternative music, give it a listen! It's all the more impressive considering the band's not even from the UK."
3,80s been there done that,I heard this CD played on a local college station and went out immediately to buy it. My first impression was that it was a very mellow 80s band. Kind of sounds like the Church and the Magnetic Fields. The big difference between this band and the other two mentioned above is that Vitesse comes up a little short in the long run.
1,A disappointment indeed,"This book has no scholarly value whatsoever. It seems to be a script for alow budget Hollywood flick or animation. By the way, The author should gethis facts straight.WHAT A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. WOW..."
4,History Is Personality,"Makes you wish that more novelists would interest themselves in history.The complaints about history are: 1) it's just a lot of dates; and 2) It's got nothing to do with us anyway.But it's not so much a question of years, as a question of sequence: Elizabeth's execution of Mary Stuart made it easier for the English Parliament to get rid of Charles I, which made it easier for the French to remove Louis XVI's head from his shoulders.And history is relevant to us because (as Holland proves) events arise from personality: jealousy, ambition, generosity, arrogance, parsimony. History would be irrelevant only if these qualities were not still with us.Note: for STAR TREK fans, the chapter on the Spartan military culture is required reading. Nothing in fiction is invented. Klingon culture is not a twist on the Japanese samurai. Klingons are Spartans: right down to the long hair."
5,Banana Taffy,"Excellent. Product was exactly as described. Arrived sooner than expected ship date, which was great. Candy was fresh and delicious!! I will be ordering more soon!!"
2,About 1/4 stale,"When our local store stopped carrying Banana Laffy Taffy I bought this for my wife who loves it. Unfortunately, about 1 out of 4 seem to be ""stale"". By ""stale"" I mean too hard to chew. My wife says the taste is OK, but they are too hard."
5,The perfect gift,"One of the ladies in my office LOVES banana laffy taffy. She has a jar and tends to ""hold hostage"" the banana flavored ones... so when I saw this I KNEW I had to send it to her! Thanks Amazon!!"
1,Why Should I Buy This?,"I already own the complete first 4 seasons of TBAA. All I know about this offer is that it contains 4 episodes, but what 4 episodes? Do I already own maybe 2 of them? Why would I want duplicates? Why don't they just release the complete seasons 5 thru 9? That's what I want.I think TBAA was the best show ever on TV, but I am not going to spend my hard earned money on the slim chance that it MAY contain ONE of my favorite episodes, and it may also contain episodes I already own!What are they thinking? I guess its the same old problem that plagues corporate America today. Profits before customer. They didn't make enough profit (boo hoo) on the first 4 seasons, so tough luck customer, this is what you get. Take it or leave it. Then they will sit back and wonder why they lost so many customers.No thank you CBS or whoever decided you no longer care about what your customers want. You don't care what I want so I don't care to give you my money."
2,Spanish Audio or Subtitle...,"I love Touched by an angel, the season 1-4 include audio and subtitle in spanish, but this DVDs not include.We love the program...thanks!"
3,Not as good as the first two,"I really didn't care too much for this book, but realize it must be read in order to keep up with the series.My problem is with the main characters of this book. Paige and Savannah just aren't that interesting to me. It deals with too much in the parenting department for my tastes. A troubled and head strong teenager, versus Paige trying to be a good parent. Not what I read paranormal romance for.There is a struggle to stay alive in this book, and it eventually gets to an adult relationship, but not until we near the end, does the story get interesting.I am reading ""Industrial Magic"" now, that has the same characters, but is so much better. Savannah isn't in it as much, and it deals more with Paige and Lucas, with a few previous characters from the first two books. All in all, get thru this book, to give you the background for the next, cause the next one is worth reading."
1,This Oven is Junk - Good luck getting service,I bought a Haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months. I called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one. I have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Their products are cheap chinese junk and they DO NOT stand behind their products. Don't believe me? Look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and ZERO customer support.
3,"Works as advertised, but NOT with iPhone","Item channels ipod output to aux jack as advertised, and arrived in a timely manner. However, this does not work with my iPhone. (Instead, the iPhone plays content through its small speaker.)I understand this item does not advertise itself as iPhone-compatible. However, this is the only dock-connector I have found so far that does not take the iPhone's audio output."
1,Just Awful.,"The sound quality is absolutely terrible. Tried it on two stereos and my PC, all with the same result: sounded like am radio being played through a sheet of tin foil. Just awful."
5,iPod interface cable,easy to use on any aux in port in almost any vehicle I have been in. Great for road trips
4,A handy cord to have,"This is much better than using the headphone jack on your iPod to connect to devices. The line-level out produces better sound and you can also adjust the volume level with just the thing you plug it into. Very nice if you want to just plug your iPod into a friends computer and they don't have iTunes installed.In fact, as long as they have a sound input, they don't have to have anything installed at all. Also works much better connecting to cars with an AUX input than the headphone jack."
1,Dont work with ipod touch 2gen/8Gig,This cable is not working with AUX input in my GX470.Dont buy it and they have wrong info in the description that it supportsipod touch.
1,Not compatible with Ipod touch 2nd Gen,"I just received my Ipod Touch 8GB 2nd Gen, and tried this cord with it in my 2008 Tahoe and it does not work. The music continues to play through the Ipod and not my car stereo. I wish I had of known this information before purchase."
3,not for long road trips,"This is a very handy cable to have in the car, IF your car stereo has an aux input. I agree that a grey or black color option would be better. Also, I am still looking for a cable that has an output that also charges the iPod. On a long road trip, your iPod will run out of juice, at which point you will need to give up playing from the iPod so you can hook it up to the car charger. Annoying."
2,Not So Great,"I actually bought this connector becuase it had great review.I guess i had high expectations, but the sound quality is no where near the original quality. =("
3,Wish it had more material,"Byte Me! has some interesting tips. However, it would be much better if had at least twice as much content. It also has a veryserious inaccuracy. The book says that you can create a Hotmail account using a false ID and send messages that cannot be traced back to you. THIS IS NOT TRUE!.. Messages can still be traced to your computer's Internet address, which identifies your computer on the Internet and can be used to find you. So you must use a truly anonymous e-mail service to be safe."
4,"An excellent book, and a must for therapists.","I am a therapist myself, so I naturally began reading this book with trepidation. But instead of the blanket attack I expected, I found instead a very carefully written book that exposes that deeply flawed foundations to much of current psychotherapy, pop psychology, and professional reputation. I read this book at a time in my own career when a respect for science and the need for verifiable information were re-emerging, and House of Cards has provided me with a number of insights and tools that have helped me to provide therapy that is more effective and that avoids pie-in-the-sky promises or beliefs. Dawes is right: although therapy is not a science itself, it should be founded on scientific knowledge."
3,Not his best IMHO,"Bocelli is the best at what he does in my opinion, but I did not care for this album. I gave it to my daughter in law, and she likes it just fine, so What do I know anyway?"
5,Andrea Bocelli Under the Desert Sky,"This is one of the best dvds you'll ever come across. I don't know what the ""negative"" reviewers are talking about - (I only have the dvd - I don't have the cd)- what did you expect for a live concert? First of all the beautiful opening with the solo spot of Andrea singing the first song - which to me is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life ( from the all-time best male opera singer in the world) - He does a fantastic job on all the songs - stop scrutinizing the ""handlers"" and focus on the real purpose you bought this dvd - to listen to Andrea."
3,My first LIVE Bocelli,"What a disappointment -- Unless I insert the DVD of this CD/DVD combo, there are 8 songs ONLY available for portability. No issue with the performance, just its format. Bocelli delivers has usual whole-hearted renditions of my favorites."
4,"Too Hard Even on ""Easy Level"".",I brought this for my 31 yr old son for the Holidays. I have watched him play. He usually finishes all the games so fast! Not this One!!! Ha! Really cool graphics and nice clips from the movies. Happy New Year
1,Kinda silly,"Return of the crap is more like it. Don't buy it kids, its basically a karatechop action game with people running around killing eachother. This has nothing to do with the book or movie so its really disappointing. But if you like mortal combat than this game is for you! Gandalf even has a killing manoever.Your friend,simpsons fan #1"
2,OK But not Great,"The game is ok if you like hack and slash, with little to no character development and no chance to create your own character. The clips are ok, but the movie was better. Go see the movie, if that's what you want, but don't get the game just for the clips. The DVD will be out soon enough."
2,DON'T GET THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE A GAMING COMPUTER!,"FIRST OF ALL, LORD OF THE RINGS IS AWESOME, BUT DON'T GET THE GAME FOR PC UNLESS YOU HAVE A GAMING COMPUTER. I DID, AND I DON'T HAVE A GAMING COMPUTER, AND IT CAN'T EVEN FINISH INSTALLING THE GAME BECAUSE IT SAYS I NEED DIRECT3D WHICH IS SOME WIERD EXPENSIVE PROGRAM AVAILABLE FOR GAMING PC'S. IF YOU DO GET THIS GAME, GET IT IN THE ""EA GAMES COLLECTION,"" A COLLECTION OF FIVE GREAT GAMES FOR JUST TWENTY BUCKS! THESE GAMES DON'T NEED DIRECT3D (EXCEPT RETURN OF THE KING, DUH!) AND INCLUDE LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING, NEED FOR SPEED: HOT PURSUIT 2, 007: NIGHTFIRE, COMMAND & CONQUER: RED ALERT 2, AND SIM CITY 3000. I GAVE LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING TWO STARS BECAUSE I HAVE IT FOR GAMEBOY ADVANCE, AND IT'S A PRETTY GOOD GAME, JUST DON'T GET IT FOR PC."
5,GREAT guide for both VETS & n00bs,"Hey, no offense to Prima - but I usually don't buy their strategy guides. Who needs em? If you're a professional gamer, you pick up most of this stuff anyway. But after reading a friend's copy, I decided to pick one up myself. Here's what you get: detailed maps (cool overhead shots!) with the same location descriptions that are in-game, offense and defense missions, MUCH MUCH more info on the weapons that the website has, and information on each of the different Tours of Duty. Best yet - and here's the kicker! They've got real-world Army soldiers talking about the maps, a history of the Army, interviews with the DEV team, and tons more info.Again, even if your not a fan of PRIMA strategy guides, this one is a KEEPER! And you get a FREE GAME CD WITH IT TOO! For... Get em while they're hot! You won't be disappointed!"
1,Strikers SUCKS,"This game is NOT worth $20. It's barely worth $5! I can't believe that I got stiffed $50 when it came out! The controls are mediocre, and you can't even use the goalie (you have to trust the dumb CPU, which misses a lot) You can only switch characters to the one (on defense) who is closest to the ball, and (on offense) who has the ball, so you can't use even the simplest real soccer play. For example, you can't use a give-and-go because the CPU won't move around the defender. Also, the total lack of penalties makes it ridiculous. I know someone who gets an advantage by giving the ball to the defense, then slamming the player with the ball into the ground and making off with the ball. The out-of-bounds area is replaced by, of all things, an impenetrable, high-voltage, electric fence. in short, a god-awful game, a first for Mario, and I don't recommend buying it for more than $10. OH MY GOD, THEY'VE MADE ANOTHER!!!"
5,This is the BEST game ever!!!!,I got this game for Christmas and I LOVE IT! I am 8 years old and this game was easy to learn to play. You get to play soccer and choose your team captain and sidekicks. There are lots of fun characters and cool graphics. It's totally NOT boring. If you have a Game Cube you need to buy this game!
5,Hilarious game,"The toad people are hilarious as always and Nintendo decided to give Peach a peculiarly huge booty. The game has been called ""aggressive"" and ""more urban"" by some reviews and I'd have to agree. Despite the fact that the other team gets a bonus item (shells, stars, etc) when you perform ""big hits"" on opponents without the ball, sometimes it's just too funny to resist the urge to check the other team into oblivion. Anyhow- great game."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Three Investigators are actually three teenage kids, one Jupiter Jones and two others with ordinary names : Pete Crenshaw and Robert Andrews. They live in a made-up place, as that is of course more fun.In this story the three junior detectives investigate a mystery involving a chinese treasure chest, a no longer floating sunken sea vessel, and person who may not be who they seem."
5,How does your garden grow.,Very good examples of various flowers. Simple information on how to do 1 stroke painting. Need a picture for a wall? Chose one they are good enough to hang on your wall.Did a pretty good job of using her prints to paint a couple of pictures of my own. Had no previous experience with painting.
2,Flowers A to Z Donna Dewberry,I have several Donna Dewberry books. I would have to say this book is not her best showing. Directions were very poor for a new painter. Finished photos of poor quality. Thumbs down on this one.
5,"If ou are into this, get this one first.","I checked out all her books and this one is the most complete. It shows most of what she paints on TV. Her other books cover mostly one type, this is packed.I can't give you any more details because I didn't purchase this to learn her technique; I am a watercolorist and was looking to see if she had any interesting movements of the brush that I haven't seen yet."
2,"IHATEPOSERS, ANTIFLAG, AND CRASS","eh. not too impressive. people say they're like oxymoron, but they are not. they are more like blitz. i wasn't too impressed. u be the judge. but i don't suggest buying it."
3,May not be in stock,"I have this hanging basket, which I bought at a local hardware store last year. It is durable and good-looking -- I like it a lot. So I searched the web to find others to match it. Evidently they have been discontinued, so they are very hard to find. I was delighted to find that Grady's Online has it. It said ""in stock."" So I placed an order. A week later I got a refund of my money, saying that the item is out of stock. I have baby seedlings that badly need transplanting into their hanging baskets, so I am quite unhappy that Grady's wasted my time and money.ps. The other review makes it sound like this hanging basket does not have drainage holes. Actually it has plugs that you can pop out, so the drainage holes are optional."
5,The best rendition by far,"I'm so glad that the original Decca recording of Dorati's rendition of ""La Transfiguration"" is still available. Chung's is too stolid by far, and de Leeuw's is fairly dry. Only Dorati really got this piece right -- awesome gong and percussion passages, beautiful rich chorales, and when the music is supposed to sound like more or less like the creation of the universe, it really does in this recording. My copy of this recording is one of my prized possessions."
5,Superior quality,I couldn't praise this product enough it works better than described. It's definitely high quality and a bargain basement price.
4,If you enjoy non-standard card games...,"If you enjoy non-standard card games, then you'll likely find this game a lot of fun. Filled with ninja antics and off-hand humor, this game is a world of fun to play, especially with groups of 3 to 5."
5,Rip It Up Dave Travis.,"I took a chance getting this CD. I never heard Dave Travis's music. I had been meaning to buy this CD for awhile, so when it said one in stock on Amazon I purchased it. Twenty songs are really good, five songs are good, five songs I didn't like, but Dave Travis, and his band rocks! The Rockabilly Revival in the late seventies, and early eighties was awesome! Go pick up some Robert Gordon, and Billy Hancock also. I know he has his own music company, but does he still perform? Anybody know?Where are you Dave Travis when we need you!Note: Two songs sound like a Buddy Holly Tribute, and one sounds like Johnny Cash, but all the others are pure Rockabilly Travis."
1,Beloved vocalist Julie London does not deserve this.,"It is amazing what some people will do to be noticed. If the Satin Doll Trio did not use London's name on the title of their CD this terrible recording would remain where it belongs, in oblivion! I wish Amazon would have a lower rating than one star, because this title would really deserve it. The trio's sense of rythm is as embarassing as the singer's, whose voice is as flat as you can get. Don't waste your money or your time, especially if you do like Julie London, who for such ilustrious career and unique talent does not deserve to have her name associated to these people."
3,Uneven,"I've had this disk since 1996. It was on sale and at the time we didn't have many Christmas disks.Most of it is really enjoyable and to my ears the last two tracks, choirs singing O Holy Night and Silent Night, are outstanding.While my reaction is less severe than that of David Baumgartner, I also find the disk uneven. Rosemary Clooney and Toni Tennille aren't classical singers, really don't have classical voices and to my taste their performances don't fit well with the rest of the disk.Fans of Rosemary Clooney and Toni Tennille who also like orchestral and choral music, as well as those who listen in the car or keep the remote control handy to skip tracks, could really enjoy this disk. Those who aren't fans of Clooney and Tenille and who don't already have a large Christmas collection could find this a worthwhile pickup if it is severely discounted. Much as it pains me to write because I like most of the disk, for others there are better choices."
5,Excellent Trunk Support,I installed it myself in 5 mins and I am no mechanic. Very strong and well built product. I think it will last many years.
2,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME!,"DID NOT WORK FOR ME STILL WAS HUNGERY I CAN SEE WHY THEY STOPPED SELLING IN THE STORES, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,How does it work?,"AbLounge ComputerCan someone, anyone please let me know how to operate this computer? I'm not at all tech savvy. I just purchased the AB lounge XL and the computer came with it, but no instructions. Now I know it can't be but so difficult, but too difficult for me! I appreciate your help.Thanks,Ty"
5,Very comprehensive study of math for Spanish speaqking persons.,This book provides a carefully organized study of math principles from easy concepts to more complex problems. Still the book maintains ease of comprehension. Answers to problems in the back are a plus.I highly recommend it!ESTE LIBRO DE MATEMATICAS ES EXCELENTE PARA EL ESTUDIO DE GED EN ESPANOL. LA ORGANIZACION DEL TEXTO DESDE PRINCIPIOS MATEMATICOS FACILES HASTA OTROS MAS COMPLEJOS AYUDAN A LA COMPRENSION DE MATEMATICAS. RECOMIENDO MUCHO ESTE LIBRO.
4,"Incredible musicianship, surprising repretoire","The quality of sound and ensemble these guys achieve together is awesome. They do a superb job on every piece on this album. The selection of pieces creates an unexpected whole that's really refreshing. This is not just for brass lovers. They selected pieces that don't get perfomed/recorded all that often so it's great just to hear them at all. This is going into my ""favorites"" bin."
1,Skip it!,"At first I thought I was really going to enjoy this book. Good girl and bad boy, etc. Then it became, well ... just stupid! They travel in time to the future, talks about Star Trek conventions, and talking gargoyles. Do yourself a favor and skip this book!!"
5,Another Great Read!,I'm a huge Kennyon and Kinley MacGregor fan and this book did not disappoint. I loved the whole bad guy turn good but not completely good story line LOL. If you love her books you will love this one.
1,peice os sad,"every socket broke down in first time use, i never see like this in my life,my friend says it is not for impact."
1,Not made in USA,I bought these sockets because the name is Michigan industrial tool. Turns out they are made in Taiwan. Not the Quality I was expecting!!!
4,"Great reading, includes ""deleted sccenes""","The wonderful words from The Hudsucker Proxy are all here, in a draft of the script that must have been close to final.Here you can see how the Coen's scripted the unique talking patterns of its characters, complete with the slang or other verbal maulings the characters use in the movie.There are also stage directions and other things you would only find in a script which helps you see how much they had visualized before the got the actors together.Finally, there are a couple scenes that were not in the movie, including a very bizzare ending scene with the two taxi drivers from the cafe (""Bromo..."")."
3,"Nice case , EXCEPT!!","i bought this case because it was roomy. As far as that goes it's the best case I've owned. The problem is with the drive rails. The cage that holds your hard drives is too wide. Your hard drives do not sit level and can sometimes fall. The customer support is NON EXSISTENT. If I had'nt built so many computers I would give this a total F. But I've since modified my case to where everything sits right. If you don't mind a lil work, then get this case."
2,TGI over,"Robert Heinlein in the classic Citizen of the Galaxy wrote describing a bad play:""The first Krausa had been a saint with a heart of steel. Disgusted with the evil ways of fraki, he had built SIsu (single-handed, staffed it with his wife... and their remarkable children. As the play ends they jump off into space, to spread culture and wealth through the Galaxy.""This reference jumped into my mind in reading this book. I had to see what the conclusion of the series was, but was sadly disappointed. All the good guys, and their remarkable wives, are saints. In five years the world progresses from post-roman empire technology to American civil war/ WWI. Link, the evil machine, seems to have had its programing stop with Douglas Haig.Based on the first couple of books, they could have done better. Can't help but think the book was the product of opinion polls and focus groups of ten year olds."
3,Cahill - United States Marshal Review,"John Wayne begins to show his age in this film. On top of that, the story line has been in several other John Wayne westerns. However, this movie is still a good one to watch with the family."
5,Warning Anti-Liberal Movie Not For Cry Babies,"He didn't make to many bad ones did he? Good clean fun, maybe teach your kids some morals and how to fend for themselves instead of signing up for welfare and food stamps, so they can eat while watching their cable TV. Just tell em, turn off the TV and the computer and go get a freaking job, then don't give them any money. Americans need to learn and teach their children to be self sufficent, like the old days, get a life and vote the liberal winey baby's out !!!!"
3,"An okay movie, but lacks something.","Cahill is an okay Wayne film, but just is missing something. The story is about 1 thing and every scene stays in the same area, for example, in ""Big Jake"" you are at the Mc. Candles ranch, then at a Mexican oil town. So, this movie got kind of boring. The introduction when it was wintertime was what I believe the best part when Wayne encounters outlaws and...uses his double barrel. Chief Lightfoot was funny in the begining when he says, ""Just one , i think i know him"" I really liked the first parts, but the rest of the movie; I would have saved my money."
1,disapointed,"I was very disapointed,this dvd was advertised as full screen(1:66),which is why I ordered it.But when it arrived it was wide screen(2:35).I would not advise ordering from this company,you will be disapointed,and waste your money."
4,Always The Duke,"I bought this DVD without expectations but wanted to add it to my John Wayne colection. To my surprise the movie was pretty good. The two young actors that played his boys did a good job as mischief makers and the story flowed as a good old western should. There were a couple of slow spots in the movie, but, that is what true story telling is about. If you like The Duke and you like the old fashioned westerns this film is not great but it is a descent film and worth a look."
5,Exercise in orchestration.,"What else can you say when a spirited performance of astoundingly inspired music is brilliantly recorded with depth and clarity as on this recording? Not only are these pieces excellent examples of Ravel's orchestral mastery; the sonics Telarc uses to tranmit them through your speakers will have you rapt with respect. The instrumental colors captured here run from excitingly vivid pizzicato stings to reflectively subdued woodwinds. The Bolero is excellent; it covers every decibel level. But, some of Ravel's slyest orchestral tricks will delight you in the Rapsodie and La Valse. This disc is well worth adding to your collection."
3,The Betrayal,The Betrayal (Book #2) was not as good as the first one of this series. It didn't hold my attention.
5,Addicted to Abram's daughters,I could not put this one down!!!! That Sadie is something else. I cannot wait to see how this story unfolds.
5,Purchase the Whole Series,Purchased all 5 books in the Series ~ Excellent! Highly Recommend this series to everyone. Love the advantage of reading it on the Kindle.
5,Would you Betray?,"All of her books are good ,no matter which one you start with.This one was up to par and gave a good read.I wont tell the story but you be sure to read it ok.Nadia Rehmani"
5,Another gem!,"I'm 'new' to Beverly Lewis but am hooked big time! This saga is thoughtful, insightful, romantic, heartbreaking and inspirational ... beautifully written and true to Amish Old Order. Well researched and well done Beverly. Each book builds on the one before it .. this one does not disappoint ... a page turner .. couldn't put it down and had to order the next one immediately! A good read."
1,Disappointing,"I agree with Mr Hazelwood. This recording is lack luster and I usually like Michael Murray's recording. Too much brass and no organ. I agree that Columbia (Sony) should re-release the E. Power Biggs Music or Organ Brass and Percussion. That is the best recording and the correct mixture of instrments I have heard in a long time. I recently sent them (Columbia) an e-mail making that request. Maybe if they get enough e-mails, they would know that we demand the best of the best."
2,OH YOU TASMANIAN DEVIL YOU!,"Give it credit for: an unusual monster (a Tasmanian Devil, no less!); a hilarious sequence where a peyote-stoned hiker sees the monster as a purple cartoon character being serenaded by singing birds; and the dumbest blonde bimbo in recent cinematic history.Other than that, you have a pretty standard creature flick with lots and lots of gore, horrible acting, and really bad special effects. But it's not the worst seen.The tasmanian devil has been what else genetically altered and goes on a killing spree in the local cemetery. PHANTASM's Reggie Bannister is the mad scientist responsible and the rest of the actors? are unfamiliar monster food. Pretty bloody."
1,CEMETARY GATES DVD REVIEW 1.5 / 5,"Yet again, another horror film where the killer monster,etc. is too horrible to look at because of the makeup and costume(s). Needless to say, there are minimal laughs throughout the movie because of the casting director and the poorly written script. One of the more stupefied lines during the movie: ""Precious, NO!"" ""Precious, I'm so sorry.... you're free girl."" I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS DVD ACTUALLY HAD A NUMBER OF SPECIAL FEATURES. THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS ME AT ALL!"
4,Well Organized,I had to use this book for a anthropology class I took at CSUEB. I liked how each nation was divided into their own chapter and had clear subheadings to find information quickly.
5,"Lovely, sweet ,soothing","A great first book. My 22 month old nephew loves the rhythm, the baby pictures, the ""uh-oh!"" as the baby climbs out of the crib. Parents and aunts like it too, which is a good thing as your baby will insist on having it read to him or her a minimum of 5 times in a row each time you pick it up!"
1,Dont trust the author.,Brett keane is well known on youtube as a liar. He has accounts that he uses for flagging so i bet that he has some accounts on amazon to promote his book. Some of his reviews are most likely fake.
2,Not what I thought it'd be,"Kelly has a reputation for being a Hebrew scholar, perhaps he was. One would never know it by reading this book. While I don't disagree with the Premill position, his ability to find his theology in ""the white spaces between the lines"" is amazing. I would not buy this book again. I regret I spent my money on it. Get Harman, Steveson, Buksbazen, or Oswalt instead."
4,I wanted to know what would happen next,"At the beginning of each chapter, I wanted to know what would happen in that chapter.At the end of each chapter, I wanted to know what would happen in the next chapter.I am certainly glad I read To Wake the Dead."
3,deathlands:breakthrough,"i thought the book was good but i like them all lol.i thought it took much too long to get into the story,when i started to enjoy it the story was over.and why after all this time and all deans been thru do they still treat him like a kid.i wonder if the next one will be a continuation.i din't like having to go back three or four books to remember different things.i also thought it left too many questions to be answerd.but i can't wait until the next one comes.happy reading"
5,Worked Out Perfectly,"This book came in really great, brand new condition and was perfect for our reading in multiple languages event! We were able to donate it to the College library after our event!"
1,Not worth the money,"If you are looing for a book to learn about XPATH and XLT. Stop!! This is the worng book. The author does not express himself in layman terms. Instead, I think that one would have to be fairly familar with the technologies that the author is trying to explain to really appreciate this book."
3,OverLooked Bluesmen Take Center Stage!,"Hasting Street Grease focuses on some lesser-known bluesmen from Detroit who span the late 40's to present time. The featured musician's style is not unlike that of some well-known Chicago Bluesmen. However, for the most part, the Motor City focused more of it's attention to generating the soulful R&B sound of Motown rather than on the blues.The CD's highlights are probably two songs from Eddie Guitar Burns who was a former partner of John Lee Hooker. Burn's harp work on ""Dixie Boogie"" and his guitar playing on the slow blues number ""Stop Lying"" are exceptional. Also putting in a fine performance on the disc is another Hooker man, Eddie Kirkland, who is featured on three tunes. Also, for pure raw emotion there is the upbeat, standout by Harmonica Shah, ""Old Time Use To Be.""The CD makes a marginally good case that Motown has more to offer than just R&B. It's actually good stuff and if you like the raw blues of yesteryear, you should give it a listen."
3,when you want a teacher,"This was a step by step by step approach which can substitute for a yoga teacher, if you are a beginner. I tended to do a few other asanas while John Friend kept talking and talking. It was helpful to have a checklist of body placement along the way."
3,Not Micro-safe,When I bought these they were $35. Not bad.I like the storage aspect of these -- they are just right for leftovers.Unfortunately the glass is thin and doesn't seem to be strong. We've broken several already.At least one of them has the glass warped on it from microwave use. After we noticed that we sorta tried to stop using them in the micro and only for leftovers or cereal or salad.Disappointed but like the bowls and lids. Just wish they weren't so fragile.
5,Right fit and form,"Constructed of quality leather, sturdy, very adjustable for just the right fit and form. The optional belt loops stabilize the whole rig nicely. Excellent product."
3,Hp Fax/ modem external,"It is a good product but I am not using it, the program on my computer didn't make for a good companion. So I purchase a fax machine."
5,Phillies Where Have You Gone,We were very pleased with the condition of the book and the speed of delivery.
2,Proof that Russians are as oversexed as we are...,"""The Burn"" attempts to be an encompassing, surreal novel about life in Russia during the 60s and 70s, but instead, the book has a confusing narrative that muddles who is speaking. Characters that are one dimensional and are interested only in sex. Aksenov includes at least 10 graphic depictions of sex in this 528 page overblown novel. It earned 2 stars instead of one because parts were quite amusing, and told the truth, and I do give him credit for that, but I cannot give him more than that, because I did not enjoy reading this massive novel at all."
5,Wow,This book is just what I was looking for. It is not an easy tome to deal with...and that will be helpful in my endeavour to learn Yiddish. Taking the easy way is often the worst way in learning. This book smacks of quality and is obviously a labour of love.I hope to do it justice.
3,Interesting fairy tale,"It is a magical tale which is strongest when describing the customers in Tito's spice shop, but weakest in the Raven and Tito love story. I also felt a dictionary defining the innummerable Indian terms would have been of some assistance. I did enjoy seeing the consequences of Tito's actions when she disobeyed the spices. Yet the ending just seemed to flip flop with the back and forth of the love story, as if the author herself could not decide how to end it."
2,"Over-rated, over-hyped, amateurish and disappointing","I thoroughly enjoyed the author's previous book (a collection of short stories called ""Arranged Marriage"") but this foray into magical realism left me cold. I was totally unimpressed by the plot, the main characters, and the writing style in general. There were a few bright spots, but the book just never came together.Magical realism is a powerful tool demanding a deft touch; unfortunately, ""Mistress of Spices"" was just plain clunky. It's a shame, because it probably could have been saved by a good editor and some thoughtful rewriting. I hope the author's next book is better."
2,Over-rated & sappy,"Though this book has some lovely passages & absorbing tableaus, much of it reads like a made-for-TV movie especially for those of us who have cut our teeth on Allende, Marquez & Robbins.Short stories may be a more appropriate form for this author."
4,Mistress of Spices,"In The Mistress of Spices, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni deftly weaves a tale of cultural maturation from the fabric of the main character's past and present. Mistress of Spices is a story of cultural synthesis, a story of a cultural becoming. Through the character of Tilo, Divakaruni tells a story of how cultures can not only co-exist, but in fact combine and transmute into a more full account of one's cultural self. She allows for the cultural self to be possessed and defined by the individual, as evidenced by the characters of both Tilo and her lover, Raven. All this is accomplished through a quickly moving story that is both lyrical and accessible. Mistress is Spices is an enjoyable read for its language and story, and a compelling cultural study for its theoretical content."
3,spice girl,"A beautiful narrative and use of language creates a magical world, but ultimately the book disappoints with its California New Agey ending and characters that you thought would end up in something more exotic than dreaming of living in the Oregon woods, like 60s hippies."
3,Average,"After many years of listening to the Professor I was not overtly impressed with this effort. A music major will have fun but, the pace is too slow for me"
5,"By the Well-Light Night, St. Peter is my friend","P.D.Q. Bach is the funniest composers of all time. This cd is quite interesting-from the Short Tempered Clavier to the Chorale-Based Peicelets. I fint the subjects of the Fugues hillariuos such as the Jumprope-skipping Song to Beethoven's minor third in Symphonie in c-moll. The little Pickle Book selections are quite odd. The Sonate da Circo is in sseveral languages-German, Spanish, ""Russian"", and some other language! My favorites are the 3 chorale-based peicelets playedon a 2 manual and No Pedal organ (2 Casio keyboards on top of one another!) I think everyone should at least listen to a PDQ Bach peice. This CD gives a good intro to his ""Music"" ****Also reccomended-PDQ Bach on the air!!****"
5,A Digest of Devotionals From Many Noteable Authors,"This book is a digest of devotionals from many authors at varying times in the past. Some of the devotionals are written by authors not too long after the death and resurection of Jesus. Most are about 4 to 6 pages of reading, followed by reflection and/or group questions. This is a good book for a Bible study like reading group. This is a good book to get others perspectives on many subjects."
1,The host is the least,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE, I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT REVIEWS, WHAT WERE YOU, PEOPLE WATCHING"
1,Horrible Just Horrible,Words cannot discribe just how terrible this movie is. This has got to be one of the worst films I have sudjected myself to. Time is to precious and one can never get it back once it is gone so please don't waste your time on this idiocy.
5,It is a family movie...,"No, really, this is a drama about a family coming back together. The monster, who is the title of the film, is the mover of the plot only in that it kidnaps the girl. The father, and the rest of the family, spend the rest of the film trying to find her and save her. Even the governments involved focus more on the virus the monster has than the monster itself. In the end it seems like they're not even worried about killing it. The cast is great and I plan to try to find more movies based on the stars and the directors. In fact, I only do have a few. The extras are fun, very interesting and go on forever! Love the humor and the behind the scenes features."
5,Excellent Buy and Great Computer,This was a great machine right out of the box. Fast and reliable. I haven't had one issue with the machine in the past 6 months and that is a small miracle considering the time I spend on the computer.
2,Alaska Women Write,"Pretty simplified written book, but if you want more real life writings from women who live in Alaska, not bad."
4,A Really Excellent CD,"Each player on this disc brings his own uniqueness to the music. Having been into ""jazz-rock"" fusion since Larry Coryell's Eleventh House records, I think this smokes. Coltrane's tunes have enough substance to flex with such a wide variety of interpretations as you'll get here. Coltrane was not a purist (if he was he'd have kept playing bebop after the party was over), and I think he'd be smiling to hear what these guys have done with his songs. Even Coltrane himself played off the music of others: ""Impressions"" was based on Miles Davis' ""So What"" and no one complains. These are gifted players playing the music of another gifted musician. I like this better each time I listen to it. My personal favorites are the Eric Johnson, Mike Stern and Larry Coryell tunes."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!,"This book was so bad. I mean, they might as well make it a puppet show, bring back Perry"
2,"noisy, noisy, noisy","the thermostat does turn the unit on and off, but it is so noisy I can't stand it. Can't hear the TV over the noise. I don't think it would have taken much to put a quieter fan in there."
3,Fine for our 1 story ranch home,"I had reservations about this gadget but it works on the same principle as an inline duct blower which are commonly used to move air through slow ducts. We have an older ranch home and did not want to go under, cut ducts and wire electrically for an inline fan so we tried this in one of our farthest rooms. To our surprise, it actually works and works well.If you have an older ranch home with narrow ducts and floor vents, this may be your solution. From the reviews it looks as though it may not work as well in two story homes at the top level but it does work for us in our 1 level older home. Pretty pleased to have found this item, it saved us from calling in an electrical person to alter our ducts under the house.UPDATE - this stopped working after about 9 months. It worked for as long as the motor was alive but it's completely dead now."
2,Not worth my time or money,"Once again Christine Feehan has totaly disappointed me with her writing (Why I bothered to try another I don't know.)The plot had some promise to it but the writing style so let it down. I struggled to get past the first 10 pages I was so disappointed. For the supposed ""Queen of the paranormal romance genre"" *rolling eyes* it read very much like a beginner trying to find thier place....and failing miserably. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and mine is that it is so not worth the money or the time that is lost reading it.For a really good well written paranormal series I would suggest Sherrilyn Kenyons Dark Hunter Series. They are very well thought out, all well tied to each other but with thier own bases and an excellent on going mystery running through all of them."
4,Pretty good,I failed to see that I needed a thermostat also until after I received this heater. Heater works great once I got the thermostat I just failed to notice that important fact!
2,Ugh. Just not well written.,"I wish I had enjoyed this book (these stories, this book), because I love finding new series to make my way through, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about the main character, the supporting characters, or the stories themselves -- I couldn't even get through the novelette at the beginning! Almost as poorly written as the Pennsylvania-Dutch series by Tamar Meyers, but not quite -- at least chocolate is interesting!"
3,"Its SOB, so its good, but buy the original.","Carlos achieved perfection with the orignal SOB. Bach would break down in tears if he could have heard it. This remake is very similar to the original but is slightly less ""fat"" sounding - owing to the newer digital synths. The original was at one point the greatest selling classical album of all time and with good reason. It was (and always will be) fantastic -simply a must have for everyone. One has to seriously question whether the intention of this remake was to improve upon perfection or sell a few more albums. Buy the orignal no matter who you are. Buy this version only if you are a Carlos purist."
3,Wait for the REMASTERED BOX SET!,"Folks, this just ain't the same as the old SOB. If you are nostalgia-driven, don't buy this one but take heart: Sometime this year, _all_ of Carlos's Baroque work will be re-released on East Side Digital, remastered by WC herself in 20-bit digital (first bundled - 'Switched-On Box?' - then separately)."
2,YUCK:-((,"Kids and me too - enjoy all ""talking/singing - activated toy dogs"" - this one is NOT a good one. It's ""talking"" is very offensive imho. And YES - ""it"" was purchased via Amazon."
5,Excelente,"Este disco tiene canciones de gran calidad y un sonido clásico espectacular. Por azar conocí a esta agrupación y la compra de este CD ha sido recompensada con creces.Si te gusta el rock clásico, probablemente apreciarás este disco. Aún no he analizado las letras, pero la música muestra cambios de tiempos, progresiones tipo Bach, pero más allá de eso, todo es virtuosismo bien canalizado, donde importa más el sonido del grupo que el lucimiento personal, a pesar de la calidad interpretativa de los músicos.¡Notable!"
1,NOT THE EDGUY WE KNOW :( :( :(,"I can say that i am pretty disappointed with the new album, this is not the edguy we know, this is not metal, this is not what we re used to and we LOVE what we were used to !!! Only song thatsounds like real edguy would be Return to the Tribe - rest is rock not metal !!!!! What is that ""save me"" it's like a boys band song !!! reminds me of bon jovi !!! please guys stop worryingabout the charts and whatever commercial stuff and give us some real metal !!!!!"
4,the Desert Fathers,"An important early Christian compilation-weirdly compelling because of sheer age . The austerity and faith of these early hermits is almost incomprehensible to 21st century minds.I found the book very difficult going primarily because of the alienness of their lives. Their words are stripped naked and primarily focus on asceticism and the barrenness of the life of the world. After a few pages I found I couldn't absorb any more. I read the sayings piecemeal, over a period of time( which is easy to do as they are short paragraphs from various men arranged under subject headings). Their thoughts give me a glimpse of of lives and faith I could not imitate. In fact after reading many of the sections, I found myself returning to the Gospels to refresh in myself the sense of God and especially Jesus' all encompassing love that made me a Christian in the first place. There are many fountains of true water in the stories of the desert fathers but not for the faint of heart."
5,A good must-read!,"This book displays the problems of the Salem which trials and hunt. It is quite confusing however. I did not get into it unitl the tenth chapter. It was boring in the beginning, but just keep reading!"
3,It was simalar to true witch trials books.,"I love the salem witch trials and I know everything about it. This fictional book had non-fiction in it also. It had all the people like Tituba and John Proctor. The book is in the first person, which gives it a little view, but a little girl, Mary Chase, can't see much. It still was a good book."
3,Interesting history,Good story with good underlying premise. It could have been shorter as it seemed to cover the same issues multiple times.
3,Great service.,I got great service from this company and received my book within the time I was told that I would. Thank you!!
2,disappointing,"Having moved to Massachusetts relatively recently, I haven't found this guide to be very useful. The descriptions are very bare-bones, the maps are only of small areas and there is no overall ""orientation"" map showing where the hikes are in the state or region overall. Plus, the hikes listed are really short! With some engineering, you can string a few together to make a longer hike, but it'd be nice if the authors would just come out and do that for you."
1,doesn't last,looks great at first. but i've had it less than a few months and it's already peeling and cracking. and my cellphone doesn't even get used a whole lot. wouldn't buy this one again.
3,Better versions available,"For the first 3 movements, I just thought that Von Dohnanyi just didn't get Mahler. He redeems himself in the last movement but it's too little too late. Orchestra plays well and the sound is pretty good with a few balance issues. It's just plain and a bit boring. None of the ebb and flow one expects from great Mahler."
4,THIS is bad?,"i know that this is more of an adult book, but i decided to read it anyway.guess what! i liked it!has great cover art, too.and you adults say this book is BAD!"
3,A decent read,"Spoilers belowThe book was alright. My favorite characters were hardly in it unfortuatly. Luke,Han and Leia had smaller parts compared to the Solo kids. And the girl,Jaina, is a pain. I also did NOT like the way Tsavong Lah went. Once again Jaina being annoying."
2,Eh,"Jacket is way bulkier and less form-fitting than it looks in the photo. Also, if you have a chest at all the pockets look very strange where they rest. Will be returning it."
5,inspirational reading,This book was un put downable. A man after my own heart. Searching for his own odyssey. So sad when Sam had to go.it insists the reader searches their own heart concerning attitudes to passions and dreams. A real account of a mans struggles and achievements against all odds and with no money. Different reactions to requests for food and shelter. Makes one question ones own potential reqponses. An incredible read for any walker who needs encouragement.Puts real life into perspective. PLEASE READ!
5,History of Jazz before Coltrane,"My first introduction to the history of jazz, and I gift it as still my favorite stating place for those who want to dig a toe into jazz.The Complete Pacific Jazz Recordings"
4,"There is music, and then there is PDQ Bach","Once again Prof. Peter Schickele dons his crash helmet in an attempt to enlighten us to the works of that epic nadir of talent, PDQ Bach. This time by using the combined might of the Turtle Mountain Tactical Woodwind Company (the Nat'l Woodwind Company in a clever disguise) to subject us to seriously massive music which could easily be used to do something which the Geneva Convention prohibits. Glorious. Johan-Bob sez 2 thumbs up."
4,Great for PDQ Bach lovers!,"We performed some PDQ Bach in high school--both vocal and instrumental. We LOVED it and I was hooked on PDQ Bach. Now that I teach, I try to expose my students to the wonderful world of PDQ Bach, too. Enjoy!!"
3,FREDA PAYNE AND BLACK MAGIC DON'T MIX...,"C'mon, now, Full Moon Pictures...if you wanted to cast the role of a priestess of voodoo/black magic, Freda Payne didn't do the job here. She's such a great songstress to feature in this 2-bit role. In fact, at times I sensed she sang her lines, rather than spoke them! While the movie had it's high points, it was more comical than scary. More like a '90s version of Blacula! Hmmm...also who's the ruff-n-tuff guy who goes in-and-out of personalities ranging from Little Richard to Mike Tyson! What a riot!! The ragdoll puppet would have been more effective if special effects were geared to body movements, rather than motion-gliding through her slash scenes. The kids can stay up and watch this one...just them them the blood is grape jelly!! Great soundtrack from some unknowns, too!!"
2,Great for starting fights,"I have three children. How many save game slots does this game have? I wish it had occurred to me to ask that before buying, as it only has two. Thanks very much to the makers of this game for creating the strife that it has in our household. To be fair, the kids do seem to enjoy playing it a lot. Of course, considering that they're going to have to share 2 slots and will therefore be playing it in a very disjointed fashion, I wonder how long that will last.How difficult is it, anyway, in this age of cheap memory, to allow a larger number of slots?"
4,Awesome Mario RPG!,"Ok so this game is alot like ""Mario and Luigi Superstar saga"" But its alot nicer. You go around finding out the story as you go through dungons and fight enemies in a taking turns attacking style fights. the graphics are great and smooth and overall its a good fun game! and I would say the time it takes to beat it is good because it takes a Good 15-20 hours to beat so it doesnt end too fast but your not playing this game for years and years waiting for it to end. You should buy it!"
4,cork yoga blocks,"4 Inch Solid Cork Yoga Block with Beveled Edges (4"" x 6"" x 9"")I like these blocks because they are very solid, light weight, and have a nice 'feel' to them. They hold your hands in place, which is nice. Also, the price is great. The only thing I don't like about them is that they are a little too large for me. Just slightly smaller would have worked better. However, overall I am very happy with this purchase."
5,The Corsican Gambit,"Hi, I know this space is for reviews, but I have been meaning to buy this book by Sandra Marton. Yet, I don't know anything about it. Can you tell me a little about the main characters?"
5,Great product!,"This conditioner is great for my long, fine, wavy hair! I was hesitant at first because two of the other Nature's Gate shampoos/conditioners were watery and generic like, but I loved this conditioner! It smelt great and left my hair smooth, soft and tangle free! I also keep it in a spray bottle with water at a 1:8 ratio to use as a leave in! I love this conditioner and will continue using it!"
2,Lost in Translation,"Autobiographical, the story is Al Kharrats recollections as a teenage boy in 1940's Egypt, recalling the changing society and customs that were soon to die out and the authors rites of passage into adulthood.I don't doubt the preface which tells of the work that went into this translation (Arabic is notoriously difficult and uses different literary devices) but despite this something gets lost in translation. The stories are very fragmented-I often had to recap-over wordy and Al Kharrats poetic musings just seem to futher fog things up.Only 145 pages long, this is a labourious read. The translation probably suits the purist ethos, but surely a translators job is to make the work accessable to its intended readers.As it is, only scraps of its potential beauty come accross."
1,Proceed With Caution,"I have not ordered this item. It may be as nice as the great awards the Playmobil Rock Castle have received for this item. However, while it looks identical to the Rock Castle on the Playmobile website, I would be interested to know why the manufacturer/distributer of this item is Kids Line, Inc. and not Playmobile as are other actual Playmobile items."
3,Mediocre Intro to working with Fuzzy,Not a bad intro to Fuzzy if you know nothing about it and the few real world examples showed me that Fuzzy Logic can be used successfully. But the work the authors have you do with the shareware is too difficult to follow. The results often didn't match up to the book's section and i was left confused. This book is very light in fuzzy theory and left me without knowing how to use fuzzy logic in the real world.
2,different package,"a package of useless junk....it comes different from what they show me on the web... it is something ""American red cross"" labeled bag, totally different from the pic. Then i check the price for the ""red cross"" grooming kit, it is cheaper than what i paid! Amazon sold me a cheaper item with a higher price, it is cheating. I would not bother returning it, last month of pregnancy. Do not buy it!!!"
1,Dead live cultures,It should be kept refrigerated to increase life. It probably was kept warm. Its not working for my son like the chewable tablets do and when I shake it like it says to do it is supposed to be effervescent. It is not.
5,great,"2 sucked. But this was a totally different story. It was original, funny, and had a great plot. Good acting and dreat special effects made this a winner. As good as the first. The knife in the n**s scene was great. If you liked the first, this is a must see. The 19th century concept was great. If Robert Rodriguez is reading this, make Dusk 'til Dawn 4, and make it more like this one, not 2. GREAT MOVIE, GO GET IT!"
2,"Not the beginning, just another vampire movie.","From dusk till dawn part 1 was such a good movie it had it all. To come back with one of the worst sequels ever made part 2, then have the guts to make another film is alot to do. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew what was on this. The film shouldn't even list special features because there is only one deleted scene that doesn't even make sense. The story is so stupid, this is not how it began this doesn't tell you anything about how the movie started. They are the same thing the vampires were allready there when the people entered the bar. It's just like from Dusk Till Dawn 1 except with different characters. The only thing the movie is showing you is the other people the vampires killed. If you like gore and vampires, you could get this but it's not worth it, get part 1."
3,"As he presented a tamp, he just asked the waiter for a cup of hot water!","FDTD 3 was ok, but doesnt compare the the first one. The second one I thought was OK but it had nothing to do with the first one, where as this 3rd sequel is kind of the same as the 1st one but it is set back in the wild west days.Again there are a lot of unansrewed questions left remaining, like why the charactors are developed for 3 quarters of the movie then they are just wiped out all of a sudden and things like that.Overall, it will come down to wether you like an action movie with vampires with a bit of fun and gore in it. Dont expect it to live up to the first one, but if you can manage to get through the slow start of the film and have patience to when it picks up, it's ok for a nights entertainment."
1,"not powerful, very loud",this fan does not push a lot of air but it sounds like it does. I also saw a similar fan at home depot for 14.99 after I bought this
2,Good enought,"The fan is REALLY loud. For the price we are using it but still looking. It pushes heat great, but we do have to turn up the TV and talk louder over it."
1,The Only Thing This Fan Moves is Money from your Wallet,"I don't generally dish out 1 star reviews but this fan Sucks and it's NOT air, but Money from your Wallet!It's worthless!Don't buy it!!!!"
5,door fan,This fan aids in the air movement through the door way. It works great and it's not as loud as I expected...based on other reviews. It is worth it. Good company to deal with and fast ship.
3,This fan is loud!,This fan is very loud! So you should think about this fact if you plan on useing it in a living room doorway. Otherwise it does move the air from room to room pretty good.
2,Broke within 2 months of use,We installed this fan for daytime use - worked perfectly for a month or so and then the plastic blades broke apart. We replaced it with a NEW fan and within a month the plastic blades again broke apart. We could not get a response from the company -
1,2 weeks and done,I purchased two of these fans. After 2-3 weeks both began to rattle then the cheap plastic fan blades disintegrated. Do not buy.
3,"God, not great","The fan does what it says. It does it more than adequately. The fan is a little noiser than I'd hoped. Also it comes with little stickie clips to hold the cord, of course they don't stay worth a darn. There aren't a lot of other options on the market, so if you're looking for a way to move air between rooms then this is what you should get. The only other items I found required putting large holes in walls, no thanks."
1,Broke after 6 weeks,"This fan is intended to draw air from one room to another - usually associated with a home utilizing a woodburning stove. We plugged our fan in in November, and ran it pretty much 24/7 (which I think would be considered normal use for a fan designed for such a purpose). It was dead before Christmas. It moved air at first, which is, I suspect, why it got a few decent reviews from people who only just got it. But over a few weeks it got slower and slower, until one morning I woke up and it wasn't turning at all. The blades aren't even dusty yet. Boooo."
1,garbage,"It was loud. Too loud, it interfered with the TV. It moved a decent amount of air, not great, but decent.You may notice that this is written in the past tense. That's because it spontaneously broke after about a month of sporadic use. The cheaply made fan blade split in two without any sort of contact whatsoever.Don't waste your $$ on this junk."
5,Most enjoyable metalcore CD I've ever heard,"This CD gets NOWHERE enough recognition. This is a thoroughly enjoyable metalcore CD that will captivate you from beginning to end with thrashing riffs, pounding drums, intricate melodies, and refreshingly meaningful lyrics. Yes this is a Christian band and yes they sing about Christian themes - but DO NOT let this deter you from checking this CD out. As for me, it only adds to the CD and gives the amazing music meaning, and meaning evokes true, raw emotion.Not one song is skippable on this CD. Every song is brutal, positive, and fresh. I would normally make a list of notable songs for a review, but honestly that would encompass the whole list of songs - although there is an amazingly sick guitar duo at the last minute and half of Aftermath that cannot go unrecognized.DON'T HESITATE to get this CD - if you like hard rock or any type of metal, just GET IT and share it with friends!"
5,American Experience - Seabiscuit,"American Experience - Seabiscuit was absolutely great, I saw it several months before the made for cinema movie came out. I couldn't wait to see that movie, after seeing it, I was actually disappointed because this PBS documentary was way better."
5,Excellent Footage,This DVD is a wonderful collection story mixed with real footage. The best part of this video (and in my opinion what makes this video worth its price) is the footage of the Match Race vs War Admiral. The entire race is shown including the race call - absolutely worth it!
4,Excellent Book to Read,"Topics in this book includesHow Involved Should I be in my Teen's Day-to-Day Life?How Can I Protect Out Time Together as a Family?Why Has Food Become Such an Issue for my Teenager?Why are Friends so Important to Young Teens?How Can I Influence My Teen's Choice of Friends?What Do I Need to Know about Peer PressureHow Can I Help my Teen be Successful in School?This book gives you infomation about what to expect about your teen's physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development. The book gives down-to-earth guidelines about what parents can do to help their adolescent and themselves through this period"
5,Safty Potrol is on a roll !,"A kid named Scout wanted to be safty potrol at his school but the princable thinks he is a jynx. Because when people aruond him sometimes get hit.(thats why it's funny!)When Scout finaly becomes a safty potrol he has to transfer schools.When he is at the school he meets this pretty girl.(she is the leader of the cheer leaders,and also Scout aready had a girl at his old school,but after he left she got a boy friend.)The pretty girl is very helpful to Scout than the other one. If you get this movie(I wish I can)it will be on a roll!You will find out how Scout catches 2 crimanals and get his safty potrol job back.(He got framed by the bad safty potrols.) This is not a 5 star movie...it's a 100."
4,Decent slippers,"Like other reviewers comments, make sure to buy 1 size larger then regular shoe size. Nice and soft, warm....dad enjoys them."
1,"Too bad , not worth it","Hi,I have bought this 2 weeks back without seeing its review.Then i realize that most of the negative reviews are true.I am not able to switch on/off some times...Connection with PC is good... but some times it got hanged and throws error...My sony ericsson mobile(from india) not able to find this device in bluetooth network.The buttons or too small... not user-friendly...i am going to return this, Voice also not good, everyone complaining about my voice from other end, they are not getting clear voice while i am walking.It is not even covering 3 feet range, full disturbances.My suggestion is go for some other one... not for this..."
5,Great Headset,"After reading all the reviews, I was a bit skeptical but picked the 655. Quite simply, it's great! The sound quality is far better than I expected and I don't understand those saying the sound quality is terrible. People can't even tell I am on a headset. It's very light and hardly noticable in the ear. The only negative (if there is one) is that in order to receive a call, pushing on it hurts my ear after a couple of calls. Pairing to my cell phone was also really easy. I'm using it with a Motorola krazer. This is definitely the headset to buy!"
3,Great in the house; terrible in the car,This my first bluetooth product. It works fine in the house or in other low ambient noise environments. Can't hear a thing when I am in the car
4,Discovery 655,"I have had no problems with this bluetooth at all, sound is good and I sometimes forget im wearing it its so light. I realy like the three charging options I especially like wearing while im fishing."
1,"Great start, quick ending & very poor product customer service","When the product arrived, it paired up with my Droid very quickly and sounded great. The features worked well for two weeks. The seller had a great price and delivered ahead of schedule.The manual is inaccurate. Per the manual, the time to turn on the unit is exactly the same amount of time to put it into pairing mode. It only takes ~2 seconds to turn the unit on.The unit currently is locked up and will only flash a blue light every 6 seconds. Holding the call button for any length of time will do nothing except make a tone when the button is first pressed.Plantronics tech support is completely clueless. Their response to this complaint was to tell me to charge the unit and then pair it with the phone by holding the call button for 6 seconds. Clearly this isn't going to work when pressing the call button doesn't do anything.This product is worthless junk. Look else where."
2,Poor reception,"I hear people great - wonderful clarity, but I sound terrible to other people - it drops the first part of words and is very unclear. Becuase of this, I can only use it to listen to VM or to take part in conference calls where I do not have to speak.This is my fist BT headset, so maybe my expecations were too high, but I would never buy this product again"
3,Inconsistent Quality,"Based on all of the reviews of this product, I was expecting a very high quality headset. I have not been impressed with the overall quality. My wife uses the product so I am usually on the other end of the call. There are times that I cannot understand anything she is saying and other times it is crystal clear. My wife likes the way it fits in the ear and the quality of the sound from the ear bud.Overall, it just did not live up to my expectations."
1,Not for the LG VX8300,"It is easy to pair with the phone and the voice quality is okay if you are very close to the phone, but you don't want to use it for voice dialing with the LG VX8300.When you activate voice dialing you never hear the first voice prompt. There is a delay in the connection so the first thing you here is ""Command timed out, Please say a command."" I called Plantonics and they tell me there is no problem with the product that the delay is normal.I would return it if I could, but I guess I will just assign it to the junk drawer. My wife's Motorola 700 works much better.Another problem is the headset works better with DSP off than it does on. Maybe I just got a bad headset but Plantronics said not."
3,Not quite as good as advertised,"Purchased this unit with high expectations but so far I have been let down. Although incoming voice quality is amazing, outgoing quality is very poor with the caller on the other end often complaining of excessive background noise and static. I'd stay away from this until Plantronics sorts out the bugs.Pros:+Size and Weight (very comfortable to wear)+Unique charging solutions+Vibrating holster+Incoming voice quality and volumeCons:-Outgoing call quality (complaints of static, echo, and background noise)-Slow to initiate BT connection-Makes voice command over BT almost impossible"
5,Great Headset with clear sound quality,"I love this thing! I came from the original Jabra over the ear bluetooth headset and this is much lighter and more comfortable! Sound quality is excellent and it is so small that most times I forget I am wearing it until someone looks at me strange! :-)My only complaint is the battery life is not as long as my Jabra on a single charge but that is probably because it is so much smaller so the capacity of the battery is reduced. It comes with so many charging options: AA Battery, USB, Wall Charger that it's not really a big concern.I would whole heartedly recommend this headset!"
3,"Nice to be handsfree, but poor reception","I bought this earpiece to go with my Samsung A900 Sprint phone. You can change the earpiece to three different sizes, which is nice. It stays in my ear pretty well too. However, I was a little disappointed at the range of reception. Everything I'd read said it had great reception and you could walk away from your phone for up to 20 feet or so with clear sound. However, I found that there was quite a bit of static interference when I moved more than 6 feet away from my phone. As a result, I had to carry my phone on me when I moved from room to room. When I was close to my phone, the reception was great. The volume buttons are handy and easy to use, but the main on/off button takes some getting used to. I'd give this a 3 star rating."
2,"Worked great, but...","It worked perfectly with my old phone. However, it is considered out of date for the iPhone 4, iPad 2, and my current Windows 7 laptop. All of the three will recognize it, but all also complain that it is no longer supported. It was great back when I got it in 2010 for 15 bucks but now it would be a waste of money.Otherwise, it does sit in the ear well and the quality is nice."
2,I stopped using this headset,"I purchased this because the reviews werepretty good on this...I don't know if it does this only to me, but it's very noisyand I can hear a lot of static.Other person in a call has difficulties hearing me most of time.I only like the design of this product(so 2 stars)."
2,Plantronics slipped with this one,"What a wonderful headset this could have been - lightweight, unobtrusive - if only the sound quality had been consistent and up to the quality standards I have come to expect from Plantronics over the years. I have a Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset, and it's fantastic. But this one was scratchy and often dropped out; we had to return it, and based on other reviews, decided not to get a replacement."
3,discovery 655,"I thought the product was 'okay' but not as good as the plantronics Voyager 510. I have both and will now continue to use only the voyager, or simply get another voyager. The voyager is more comfortable, at least to me, and most importantly it offers better clarity on the call from both ends.Come on, plantronics, you can do better than this.jim g"
1,Online learning information,"This book only talks about what online learning is, if you want a resource for finding the right online class for you, find another book because this does not give information for where to find your class, it only explains what online learning is about."
3,this was exPENsive,"This cat food was expensive and my cat doesn't like it. It's too bad because was wicked expensive, the only way she could kind of eat it is if I grinded it with a mortar and pestal."
2,Messy and more,"I've tried this product with my cat and will more likely not buy it again. I was in a hurry and the petfood store I went to didn't carry the grain-free brand I usually give to my cat so I thought I could give a try with this food.I feed kitty using a toy food dispenser. It's a cylinder with holes, filled with food and my cat rolls it in order to get food. While the toy is in a tray to prevent getting cat food everywhere in the house, that food makes a mess of little crumbles and gunk all over the tray and dispenser. It's never happened with other dry cat food (royal canin, science diet, orijen, etc).Also, my cat started passing huge stools since he's eating that food. Like twice as big as usually. No fun cleaning the litter box and I don't feel I get a lot for my money as the cat seems to poop half of what he eats.Going back toOrijen Regional Poultry and Fish Grain-Free Dry Cat & Kitten Food, 5.5lb!"
4,You really don't need Puzzle League,I bought this because I've been a Dr. Mario fanatic since I was in grade school and it gives me both nostalgic and entertainment pleasures. Dr. Mario is great but puzzle league sucks...
5,Reading One of the Great Minds of the 20th Century,"About twenty years ago I began reading Jung and found this volume to be my most trusted of trusted companions. It was edited by the great Joseph Campbell and provides the best introduction to Jung's writings that I've come across. I always keep the volume handy, and each time I visit the various chapters I learn something new about human psychology, about the unconscious, about the shadow, about the complexities of the psyche and of human behavior itself. The volume is like a roadmap, a lonely planet guide that enables you to handle all the winds of misfortune that, without rhyme or reason, are guaranteed to hit you in life, all the grief, pain and sorrow that comprise the human experience.-Tom Maremaa, Author of the Forthcoming novel ""Metal Heads"" from Kunati Books in Spring 2009"
4,To Much to Know,This book came exactly as described. Its a wonderful book if you like Jung and as with most stuff written about Jung its not an easy read but necessaryif you want to really understand the man and his Philosophy.
3,Great Book for Decoration but Not Much of a Read,Great inspirational decorative book but not much in the way of reading. Simple ideas about relaxing and smelling the roses..
3,Good introductory book,"I've used Access for some years and read a little about SQL Server mostly in ASP-books.I found the book concise, not too long, and helpfull in starting using SQL-server 2000.You can read it first as a novel to get an overview, and later use it as a reference to actually do the stuff."
1,By the Dark Lords of Sith!,"imagine yourself, not in a galaxy far far away, but a lounge far far too close the air is thick with smoke and the star of the show, Bill Murray, resident lounge lizard, is playing his favorite selection of star wars tunes.... Or might I be a bit generous on saying it was that good? .... this is quite simply the greatest desecration of any talented mans works or music EVER, at least when Frank Zappa changed peoples music into seemingly horrific monstrosities, you could see the effort he put into his work, unlike this group."
2,Try Americolor instead,I have used this coloring several times and always end up with a weird purple fondant instead. I even have a hard time making gray. You could use the method of mixing the dye to the melted marshmellows or using dark modeling chocolate with it to give it a base (Google: How to make Black Fondant) but from what I've read Americolor has a better black dye. I use Wilton products all the time but this one is a dud.
2,Queer Theories,Interesting slant on being or becoming queer. Worth a read if you're interested in the subject but don't know where to start. I studied it in an adult learning lifestyles class in University.
1,Smells like plastic or something!,"This is my first review after using Amazon for many years. I have been using the Cotton Candy spray since 2007. When I saw the moisturizer, I was so excited. It smells awful! I slathered it all up and down my arms and couldn't stand myself and ended up in the shower. I don't understand, since I also ordered the spray and it is wonderful. I don't know if it has been sitting on a shelf too long or what, but it is going back."
2,Frustrating!,"I picked this book up for the puzzles and the general strategy. After spending less than an hour with it I realized that this is a poorly edited guide. The first puzzle that I tried had a setup with more H's in it than come in a scrabble set. I overlooked this and inserted a blank for an H. Annoying but not unforgivable. A few exercises later I was stumped. I am a decent player (1400+ rating on Scrabble Beta and I almost always score over 300) but I couldn't for the life of me solve this exercise. After spending 3 times the 10 minutes of allotted time for the exercise I decided to check the answer and found a word containing a Q, which was not on the rack or the board setup for the exercise. I took it back the next day before I wasted anymore time with it. If you are just looking for Scrabble strategy I guess this book is fine, but it isn't updated and it doesn't even adhere to the basics of Scrabble in its exercises."
2,hmmm,I am not sure what to think about this movie. It is definitely controversial in nature. I watched it once and sold it about a week later. A little too controversial for my liking.
2,Love the movie.,"I got this product in the mail a day before it was even scheduled to come, so I was very happy and glad! two days later, before i had watched the movie, i left feedback on the sellers profile noting the fast service. last NIGHT i watched the movie and there were glitches in the movie about every 2 minutes. It's made me SO angry, that I wrote this wonderful feedback and now I know that I should have done otherwise. I'm not sure if it was the sellers fault or postal service, but the movie is not in good condition as promised. I'm thinking of sending it back. I wrote this here, because I can no longer give any feedback to seller."
3,A tad unsatisfied..,"The main reason I bought this in the first place was because of the homosexual loving. Hah. No,seriously. Anyone who,like me, is looking for a good gay love story...you might be disappointed. What interactions your see between Duncan and Perry are very one-sided and only make up about 15-20 minutes of the whole movie. Regardless though, this movie was moving. The ending made me cry. I was disappointed at first because I wanted more about Perry but then I realized that that wasn't what the movie is about. It ended perfectly."
1,I love Emile Hirsch but had this movie,"I thought this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. To start off with the whole opening sceen is so unessasarily long. And that is how the movie progressed, unessasarily long pauses. Like I said in the title of this review I love Emile Hirsch, in fact he is the reason I bought this movie with out seeing it first, but this movie is just awful. I am a fan of movies that have an underlying plot of people coming to terms with their sexuality but this movie seems to just throw homosexual encounters in for the shock value. I would honestly and full heartedly recommend not seeing this movie unless you like really long draw out pauses, and I mean really long, and uncomfortable sceens that make your head hurt."
4,Very helpful but a little dense,"This book has a lot of information not only on how to read the Bible, but also on its historical context (exegesis) and how it can apply to us today (harmenuetics.) This book has so much though that to read this book for all its worth requires a dictionary and time. If you want to learn about the Bible as well as how to read and understand it and have the time to go through it, then this book will be a great buy for you."
1,How to Read the Bible for all it's Worth,"Doesn't shed light on any of the bible's true worth. Confusing and contradictory. Author, evidently, hasn't gotten a revelation of God's true Word. Hope that that revelation will come."
2,Regarding Kindle Version,"This is one of my favorite books so naturally I wanted to have the updated version on my Kindle. To my surprise, after downloading the Kindle version, I realized it was the 2nd edition, even though the 3rd edition has been out for quite some time.I guess I should have looked closer, but I would think Amazon would provide the most recent edition for the Kindle."
4,Great book for deeper understanding of the Bible,"This book lives up to it's name. For anyone who seriously wants to study the Bible and understand it in a deeper and more wholistic manner, this is a GREAT tool for you. It is written in a manner that is easy to understand by the novice Bible student and yet equally helpful to the seminary student."
5,Words can do it no justice.... Listen to it.,"Peel off the plastic wrapping with reverance. Carefully take out CD1 place it into your CD Player [if you don't own one, steal one]... Listen. Take out CD2 and place it into your [newly aquired]CD player and once again listen... but this time 'feel the rythmn/through your system' Dance, or moove or whatever it is you might do.An awesome mix by Sasha, once you've gone through it listen to it again, you'll find what you missed the first time. Don't ask questions, let the rythmn do what it was created to do."
5,dont take my word for it,"i cant say anything that hasnt been said about this cd sasha knows how to lay it down, if you took the time to click this cd go ahead and buy it impossible to be dissapointed"
2,Not one of his best CDs,"I really love this guy and love the North, West and Expeditions albums he did as part of Northern Exposure, but this CD - well, it doesn't totally suck, but it also doesn't kick ass for me. Even his latest Ibiza release has more tension and excitement about it. Most tracks here don't touch me at all."
5,Bow down and praise,"With all the hype surrounding the world of electronic music, it is refreshing to find an artist who can deliver the goods. Sasha's ""San Francisco"" set is a mix of both hypnotic and thunderous beats that doesn't stop until the climatic end. Using a diverse selection of songs, this disc bustles with all out dancing grooves including Medway's, ""The Resurrection"", Attaboy's ""Solid Space Business"" and Tilt's hopping ""I Dream"". Throw into the mix the jaw dropping ""Movin' Thru Your System"" by Jark Prongo and prepare to let the dance floor buckle. But what truly sets this disc apart is the talent that Sasha has in the mixing. Blending the songs into a seamless pattern he uses great technique to move the beats into a joyous wasteland. Finally a disc that is consistent from open to close without a dull moment. If you want to believe, now is the time. One listen and you'll be hooked."
3,I'm sure that he can do better,This CD set was okay. I had to listen to it a couple of times before I started even liking it a little. I'm sure this guy can do a lot better than this. I mean the quote in the back saying that Sasha's selection of trance is magic? Come on man.
1,New Radica Fliptop Solitaire is a FLOP,"I was VERY disappointed with this latest version of the Radica SOLITAIRE hand-held game. The numbers and card suits are barely visible, even with the back light, making it eye straining and laborious to play. Older models had excellent dark on light contrast. Bring the OLDER MODELS back into production! The 1998 to 2003 versions were the best. The newer models deserve an F for Failure."
1,Sent Wrong Book,I was dissatified with my order. First it came three weeks late and when it did arrive it was the wrong book! Never again!
3,Kids Like It,"This version got my 3rd grade grandson to listen to classical music and like it, which is why I purchased it in the first place. He took it to school and they listened in music class - humor and good music - a good way to add the classics to their education."
1,execrable,to be avoided at all costs - nightmarish - I had to give it 1 star as there is no option for no stars
1,A good read spoiled,"I am certain that Mr Cohn is a bright man however it would appear that little effort went into this book. The content is highly repitive,he could have deliverd his thoughts in one third of the space and delivered a much better product in the process. He often describes that which he will be writing about later in his book. I tried many times to read this book but would become frustrated with the content and delivery. Save your money or spend less money and purchase one of Rotella's books"
3,What Great Fun,"What great fun I had watching this movie. I really enjoyed the music, and the characters in the movie were just like the kids were back then. I was taken back to the days of American Bandstand and other dance shows of that era. Really fun to watch and fun to remember........"
5,Campy and hilarious!,"This movie is great! I love John Waters films, they make me feel like I've been to Baltimore, even though I haven't! It's very campy and fun. Go John Waters!"
3,Alright,Don't get me wrong it's still a cute movie. It is just doesn't fit in to this decade. I still think it is much better than the renewed version. Sorry I always like the original films better. I just think I would say that I liked it much more when it first came out.
2,not as good as the newer version,I only recently watched this and didn't realize beforehand that it was not really a musical. I much prefer the newer version. It's just not the same without the music.
2,Almost UN-WATCHABLE.,"Looks like Spanish people or Philippines and not martial artist from china as they fly more than planes at Chicago airport, that makes this movie so silly and foolish I couldn't watch more than 8 minutes of it.How anyone could rate this highly means they have never seen an actual movie before, much less good ones. Stay totally away from this pathetic bomb."
2,Rent don't Buy!,I have a huge Kung-fu movie collection and after watching this movie I had to sell it. There is too much B.S. in this movie. I gess it is good for A laugh!
4,Fun but a little tough - but still fun!,"This is really neat. You can choose to play as several different Disney Dogs on this virtual board game. You use your DVD control to choose your dog and also to spin the spinner to see if you can move 1, 2, 3,4 spaces. You earn blue ribbons by answering dog questions that can be from any Disney movie with dogs. There are 2 ways you can play family or expert(I think it's called). We've played the family and it's hard. And when you get an answer wrong it doesn't tell you the correct answer. It's a little frustrating for our 4 year old, but she does want to play and she knows to stay way from Sneaky Pete's square which makes you loose a ribbon or other squares you might loose a turn. It is a cute game and a must for those who love Disney Dog movies!"
5,Great Disney Board game for kids,This is an excellent board game for Disney fans and kids who love dogs. My niece lobes this game!!! GREAT PRICE!!!!!
3,Before you give it too much credit...,"You should know that ""Catch Me"" is actually a cover of ""Hobart Paving"" by Saint Etienne and an inferior version of a beautiful song."
1,after reading other reviews...,"this cd is really good and boasts many talents, but...like the old gloria record ep, it gets old. if you've never heard this kind of music before, then get it by all means. but if you know of mineral, you'll probably like mineral better. it sounds a lot like u2 and radiohead. i see them live a lot, and basically, i've been disappointed lately. i used to think their music meant something to them. the last time i saw them in austin, they looked bored. i don't know...maybe the boys will cook up something new with their new music. let's hope so."
3,Pay more for something nicer,"The price on this bath hardware was decent, the items were well-packaged, and the box shipped a lot faster than expected. I'm a little disappointed in the quality. While I love the satin nickel finish, these items look a little chintzy. My recommendation: Buy your pieces individually from a store where you can see them in person, pay a little more, and get something that looks nicer."
4,Underrated master,I was shocked by this CD. Nick warren truly is underrated. I found this mix and his others to be at a level beyond Paul Okenfold and Sasha. Yet he hardly gets the same level of attention. Nobody gets the same level of attention of okenfold though .. sadly. This represents the first of many GU's featuring Nick Warren and is a great listen if you want to hear how much his sound has matured and changed. Nick Warren has more Gu's out than anybody else for a reason. he is just that good.
5,Fant-abulous!,"Paige returns in this novel, where she and Lucas do Luca's father a favor by hunting down a vicous vamp that is killing Cabal kids. Which means Savannah is a target, so she is sent away to Elena for protection while Paige and Lucas work together to find this vamp. But the job actually requires more help than they expected, so they call in Jamie, a necromancer and the help of the Elena, Clay, Jermey, and Savannah as well. Great Read!"
1,junk,do not waste your money this is not a lost superman movie this is bits and pieces of superman movies from the complete diamond anniversary edition superman collection
3,worth reading,"This is book tells the story of a clan which is in the run-down. It is centered in a young man, Baoyu, and all his ""sisters"".Don't expect a story in the traditional point of view, I mean like greeks said: an introduction, a development and an end.This does not follow this trend, well, one could say that it sort of has an introduction and an end as a matter of fact but this book must be read as is, just daily life in the Rong and Ning mansions. Do not expect either a very deep story or characters, it is kind of superficial in fact although there a lot of characters and their whereabouts and machinations are told.It gives an insight though into what might have been the life in that land and in that time, keep in mind though that this still a book.An overall enjoyable piece."
5,It will color your dreams,"This Chinese classic still has the power to surprise and delight. This edition has good footnotes and good translation, and nice illustrations, though there are some typos and the print is smaller than I'd like. I bought it used, and it was in very good condition."
4,Great holster,This holster is great. It needs a little break in time but I Love it..... It's great for men. The only downfall is for women. When I have a jacket or a larger shirt it's perfect. Any form fitting clothes it doesn't work with but it's not easy concealing a full size handgun on a female.
4,Were's The Bus?,"And lets just face it - The Queen's speech wasn't exactly a gas, either. This film has its wierd moments, yes, but there are some shots that are funny and interesting, such as the part in which Nicole, the little girl, is playing on John's lap, and of course, I Am The Walrus. That is, as many reviewers have said, the highlight of the film. I don't recommend this film to anybody who absolutely HATES the Beatles. I DO recommend the film to diehard fans (Such as myself), who just cannot get enough of the Fab Four and will watch anything."
2,Wait for a remaster,"The master used for this copy is pretty bad, and it can not be from an original print. If you don't believe me, just check out the MMT footage used in 'The Beatles Anthology'(it's fantastic!). Apple must have access to the master, so my advice is to wait until they decide to issue this one themselves, maybe with bonus footage (are you listening, Apple...?)"
5,Let The Beatles take you away,"As usual I also have this film isn my video library. The Beatles' 3rd film was originally in 1967 on BBC-TV. The movie's BEST highlight is the scene were JOHN,dressed as a waiter, comes with a shovel in his hands, and feeds a moutain of spaghetti to a very obese woman.[This scene was ACTUALLY based on a dream that LENNON had during production] Another GREAT highlight of this fantasy filled film, is that it is the only time we get to see the ONLY PERFORMANCE of 'I AM THE WALRUS'."
1,Do not order this version of Magical Mystery Tour,I was sent this DVD incorrectly. I ordered the other version which at that time sold for $24.99. This DVD would not play in my DVD player. I was offered a refund from the supplier but Amazon would not offer the replace it with the version I ordered. The price on the version I ordered has skyrocketed to almost $60! Be very careful when ordering.
5,"SERIOUSLY, not as bad as people make it out to be!","After reading numerous reviews all over the internet, including Netflix, I was a little wary of ordering this movie. But, being as big a Beatles fan as I am, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviewers!Yes, I do admit, the transfer quality could be better, but it's definitely not an unwatchable movie. It is also one of the silliest movies I have ever seen, but then again, Help! and A Hard Day's Night were incredibly silly. The only difference between those 2 movies and this one was that Magical Mystery Tour was an experimental movie with Paul at the helm through most of it. It has no script, no plot, very short,and incredibly trippy at points. But if you're a huge Beatles fan, I guarantee you will love this movie.My only complaint? Not enough George ;) Although I did love his performance of ""Blue Jay Way""...one of those incredibly trippy moments I was talking about.Again, a must-see for hard-core Beatles fans!"
3,It was so strange,"I like the movie, I think it has some good musical numbers and it has some funny scenes. The scene of John with a shovel putting pasta on the fat lady's plate is so John Lennon, and the ""I am the Walrus"" number is so 1960's. I mean what the decade and it's music were about is in that song."
1,Magical? Not really.,This release is horrible. It's just a straight copy from a VHS not a master tape. The sound quality is average and the picture quality is poor. Unless you're a desperate Beatles fanatic I'd suggest wait for an official DVD release (if ever) or rent a VHS copy from your local library and save the money.
3,weird,"great music altho they tried toio hard to be weird, i giv em a pass. they are the beatles afteer all"
3,Buy the $10 copy first.,"Third-Party Sellers are offering copies of the movie for $40 and up, claiming them to be re-mastered, &c.;, but who knows.My advice is to buy the $10 copy first. It is washed out, but you get the gyst of the story and then, if you REALLY like it, shell out the $40. (But I'd email them first for a guarantee that it's truly a cleaned up version.)I suspect, though, that after watching the movie, you'll be happy you only spent $10."
5,"Truthfully, the Quality really isn't all that bad.","I was incredibly relieved when I first watched this, after reading all of the terrible reviews on here. The quality, although not perfect by any means, isn't bad. It is definatly watchable. There are only a couple of scenes where the quality is really bad, most noticeably the bus scenes where the sun is shining in through the windows. I am generally satisfied with my purchase, considering it was brand new for seven bucks. The cover doesn't look like a bootleg by any means, either.If you go in to this thinking of the historical value, and that it is over 40 years old, you will enjoy it.If you go in to this thinking it is going to be Blu-Ray Quality, you're going to be disappointed.Just enjoy it for what it is."
2,magical mystery tour/the beatles,"this movie really is kind of boring, however since i enjoy the beatles, & 4 my collection, just have 2 have it. the music videos,adds to the watchin, of the movie; however he rest, not this best. thanxz, & the beatles 4 ever:)"
1,Magical Mystery Tour Review,"This movie has been through the ringer by the critics but for Beatle fans like myself, its a must have. The highlight of the movie is the ""I am the Walrus"" and while there are other classic tunes within the movie, this purchase was more for my collection."
2,they were not alone in the music world!,"for die hard's beatle fan, the admiration could be accepted well, but the time when Beatles did this silly film,...they were sick in heart & soul...the magic was not there. Ringo & Paul just filmed it with everyone in the bus. And then they made a tour with that magical bus.Wake up your minds all! there are many other much better rock bands than beatles, check out the songs remains the same (LED ZEPPELIN DVD) or LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (DEEP PURPLE DVD). The magic performances were there.....!!!"
1,Magical? Hardly.,"I bought this a few years ago when I was a hardcore Beatles fan... and was extremely, extremely dissapointed. If I wanted to watch stoned people act stupid I could go to a club, which I'd rather do than spend the $ I wasted on this film.Bottom Line: You had to be there to like it."
2,Really really bad quality dvd makes movie unenjoyable,"Don't bother with this one...wait for an official remastered-release(if they ever do it). This is just as bad as the day the BBC first aired this on Boxing day in black and white. I've seen this movie on VHS many years ago and I have the Beatles Anthology DVD with scenes from the movie, so I know what the picture quality of the movie should be. This DVD feels like an amateur pirated copy. The picture is so bright and fuzzy it washes out details and color.I bought this movie for the wonderful visuals and the music of songs like""I am the Walrus"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"". This movie is full of wonderful oddities that are a joy to see but they are very hard to appreciate when the quality of the picture is so poor."
3,"Fuzzy, wuzzy","There was a funny ""Hard Day's Night,"" a goofy-funny ""Help""...and ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" apparently filmed intentionally out of focus or the folks at Avenue One were fooling with me. Filmed with all the aplumb of a high school video production shot in Super 8, if you remember what that was. The unapparent plot involves a bus and an ongoing spat- apparently comedy relief- between Richard B. Starkey and his aunt Jessica. The music, however, is better than ever. A must purchase for Beatles completists, but others may merely content themselves to purchasing the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" CD available from Amazon. Oh well, the DVD from Amazon Marketplace cost less than a movie ticket in the big city."
1,Magical Mystery Tour,"Unfortunately both DVDs I received from Amazon of this movie had problems with sound at the end. Check yours! When they go into the tent, and George sings and plays, the words don't keep the same time as his mouth. And during the last song the Beatles sing,(coming downstairs in tuxes, etc.), you cannot hear the singing.Otherwise, I love this movie, because it's the Beatles. These are just bad copies. I hope Amazon gets some new ones."
1,"Yes the quality is bad, but the Beatles are worse!","I like the Beatles but not everything they touch turns to gold. The Magical Mystery Tour is horrible! There is no plot, no acting skills, and certainly no magic, mystery, or even a tour for that matter. It is complete nonsense! Most shows or movies from the 1960s were either goofy fun or weird but made a point, this is niether! I wouldn't even call it a Beatle movie. I would call it seperate footage of Ringo and Paul edited together with a couple of clips of John and George thrown in for kicks and giggles. I only give it one star because the theme song is catchy.The early Beatles were good but after this I can see why they never made it longer than the Monkees or other groups!"
4,Great!!!,Exellent saga of vampiric story.Easy -to- read tales with great sense of time and atmosphere.Extraordinary piece.
3,SOME WHAT UNEVEN,"Ann Rice has a poetic way of writing ones thoghts, and with each book she tried harder and harder to confuse the reader, perhaps not on purpose, but to keep the readers interest she tried to hard perhaps. So wonderful was her first book of the vampire series, yet the others cannot compare."" The vampire Lestat"" was too homosexual and somewhat out of hand with all the crazy adventures, considering Lestat decided to live such a boring life in New Orleans later. But the Queen of the damned was on the other hand very good, the history behind the vampires coming to light. She didn't leave you hanging on this one. The tale of the body theif is also very interesting, and finally....LESTAT MAKES LOVE TO A WOMAN....CAN IT BE??????? My favorite is still ""Interview with the vampire.""..In my never too humble opion that is her best work."
2,ho hum...,"Ann Rice is over rated. He books are long, drawn out and boring. I found Interview with the Vampire pointless, and even the The Vampire Lestat, a premise I liked and was eager to read, was dull. If you want to read good vampire books, try the Anita Blake series"
2,interview with a vampire set review,This puts me to sleep whenever I try to pick up the book. I have yet to finish it and purchased it 2 months ago.
2,So-So,"This book is nowhere near Generation X (early 90s) but more of Generation Why (late 90s). The plot was good but the characters all seemed to be attempting to act older than they really were (and I think most of us can agree at 29 that we really didn't know as much at 19 as we thought we did). The ending seemed a bit unrealistic, with Abby getting a job in NYC before she even had a shred of fashion design experience under her belt. A final project in college doesn't mean squat in lieu of real experience. And when she finally flew to the Big Apple, what happened to all her stuff? She left behind her car, her pink and orange striped couch, and her ""closet crammed with clothes"". The book doesn't say if she sold them, shipped them, etc. A good attempt, but immature."
2,5 stars for content - 0 stars for sound quality,"The sound is SO BAD in this DVD that it is almost unwatchable. If not for the band, and the vintage material, interviews, etc, it would be a complete waste of money.This DVD goes as a nice compliment to their other double live DVD 'Showtime'. Showtime is great quality, but no Schenker."
5,expert and practical,"The two authors are highly expert, yet chose to write this book in plain English. The explanations are extremely clear. Everything they say is practical -- no schmoozing, sympathizing, or cheerleading. The subject is treated in a unified, well-organized, and thorough manner, not a hodge-podge of scattered ideas like most books about learning impairments for the general public. I would give this book the highest recommendation for teachers to read, and it's also good for parents of children who are hyperactive. One word of caution, though -- it is about children who are hyperactive, not children who are ADHD/inattentive type."
4,Nice downhome wholesome alternative rock,"One of the best local bands to come out of the Denton music scene in the 90's...Way underated...I had the good fortune of seeing them play the D/FW area several times, and their live act was just as good (if not better) than their albums...Recommended if you like The Lemonheads (90's era)"
2,For the dedicated PDQ fan only...,"Okay, I am not really a listener of classical radio stations, soI cannot comment on whether this send-up of classical radiostations is really fair. But, when I am trapped in a car withoutmy IPOD, I do listen to many pop radio stations and thematerial on this CD with lots of annoying and stupid DJchatter is all too familiar. But that is the problem. Listeningto this CD is like watching a comedy skit that goes on and onlonger than it has to. Yes I did laugh a few times at the materialand the liner notes. But I cannot say this is really even ""average""PDQ material, hence the below average rating."
3,an okay device,honestly not as helpful as I was hoping it would be but did make things a little easier so it's ok to get I guess
4,warm springs,"i watched only part of warm springs, and was amazed at the protrayal and insight into FDR's gradual acceptance of his disability. especially so in the depiction of his dreams of normalcy. i'm crippled too(although not as much as he)and i thought i was the only one who dreamed of walking with a bounce in my step again, or running alongside my daughter. i thought it was my typical denial again. the writers and kenneth banaugh however deoicted the feelings of despair and some hope so accurately that i don't feel so alone or strange anymore."
5,Very Good Movie,"I don't know about the historical accuracy of this movie, but it was very entertaining and well acted, in my opinion (naturally, since I am writing this!). It left me wanting to know more about FDR and I think that in and of itself should recommend it."
5,This is the best CD I own,"I love this cd, I found it at a thift store. I listen to it all the time. If you want awsome music BUY IT!!!"
3,London Symphony,"I'm not sure I like this CD. Attemting to make a symphony out of famous songs gets to be a little heavy handed. The Boston Pops, James Last, Richard Clayderman, Franck Pourcel do a much better job at making the music fresh and new. I was disappointed with the entire CD."
2,Very disappointing,"Overblown, overorchestrated, overused percussion, sounds dated, not at all what I had expected. Takes way too much license with the original music for no artistic reason. Ruined some of my fovorite songs of alltime: Bohemian Rhapsody, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Layla, Stairway to Heaven, Nights in White Satin. British Invasion maybe, but not at all my cup of tea!"
3,Fits but not the best,"The battery is thick and makes the phone heavier. It doesn't hold more charge than the original 1000mAh, so the bigger size is not warranted. I think the problem was with the phone rather than the battery. Anyway, I just got a new phone, but thought to write this review before it becomes a piece of history."
1,This is garbage,This is a waste of money. There is no music by either Biggie or Tupac it is a documentary with still photo's and other people talking over the still shots. The people interviewed for the documentary are way behind the scene people. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"WAY over priced.Arrived with 3 broken panes of glass.Workmanship was poor and sloppy.Definitely not worth the $200 +.I already had one like this but it waswired for plug in fluoresent bulbs, Iwanted one that was for a regular screw intype bulb.I had an electrician scheduled to replacethe light, so returning it was not anoption. I had to remove 3 panels from theexisting light and use them on the new one.A lot of work to go through after payingso much money.Next time, I'm buying local to seewhat I'm getting before I pay for it."
2,Ok for the price,This table cover is much smaller than you think. I did not fit over the table and chairs only the chairs. Also it has a hole for the umbrella that I did not want. The shipping was close to $9 and to return it it would have cost another $9. I ended up keeping it because it would have cost me more to send it back than it was worth.
1,Eh???,Not so hot dvd. I am 30 and kind of grew up hearing their classics. Not worth the effort of buying this. I was disappointed. I think I remember seeing Michael McDonald in only one part of the dvd. Not cool. Rethink the purchase!
5,Movie Music,"If you love that music from all those movies you've seen, then this is the CD you want! It is fantastic!! I want more!! I hope Erich Kunzel will come out with some music from older movies and maybe some TV programs. Listening to his music is better than watching the movie."
5,Great book.,This book was actually bigger than expected. It has some really good advice for boys in a world with a lot of people with bad advice. Great book.
4,Let's Rock,"Comparisons to individual bands are probably not worth much here, and fail to do justice, because this album and this band, Sleeping at Last, are a product of many influences--some obvious, a lot not so obvious--but it should be taken as such: music which is the sum total of a lot of music you probably like. As the realization of a lot of good musical influences though, they're clearly something on their own: a former independent Chicago band writing beautiful melodies that are musically and technically complex and lyrically sophisticated, yet producing a sound from three musicians that is as enormous as arena bands like Coldplay or U2. Most importantly, this album rocks. So if there are comparisons to be had with Smashing Pumpkins, it's that the latter made rocking out and being cool okay, and this does too. So buy this album; and rock; toss your hair back, cross your arms; then rock again."
5,Ghosts,This cd is absolutely amazing! I saw them in concert with Switchfoot and I never thought the cd could be as good as they were live but I was wrong it's incredible!
4,Good stuff,"Yeah, I saw these guys in LA with Switchfoot too, and they were great live. They played the title song from the album, which is awesome, although not entirely original (you can definitely hear the Radiohead influence on that track). Some of their songs can start to sound a little bit the same, but they're good at what they do, so it's cool with me.A solid buy that you won't regret. Really good stuff, and I hope we hear more from them in the future."
5,You can't get better than this,"If I could take only one recording to a desert island, this would be the one. It was recorded when Fischer-Dieskau was at his peak, and he has made this cycle a one-man mini-opera, which he performs with beauty, sensitivity, and sincerity."
4,Great imagery.,"This is a great imagery initiator for getting kids started on mediation or relaxation. The book is comprised rather well with lots of options. Great areas that include gardens, holidays, animals and just plain fun.Great response from the kids when using this book."
4,Inspirational,"Starbright--Meditations for ChildrenPerfect for use with groups of children or to put your own children to sleep. The visualizations are short and creative. My daughter will usually pick 2 a night. She closes her eyes while I read Maureen Garth's melodic verses. I too enjoy losing myself in the visualizations. Each night we pick a different story. Be it panda bears or fairies or waterfalls or clouds or even dancing shoes. We love having such a wide selection. The author also has 2 other books which are equally enjoyable. Each chapter is very relaxing, very comforting. I also enjoy adding deep breathing and affirmations to our bedtime routine with such books as Sea Otter Cove. It is worth a little bit of effort to help your child sleep peacefully.Sea Otter Cove: A Relaxation Story introducing deep breathing to decrease stress and anger while promoting peaceful sleep (Indigo Ocean Dreams)"
4,Great for Children,"Great resource for working with little children in a quiet setting. Enjoyable for all, especially teachers who are trying to instill a sense of reflection time."
3,Dissappointed,I received this as a gift five months ago. It is sufficiently large and carries all my tools with no problem. However the bottoms of the knife pockets have started to blow out allowing my thinner bladed knives to slide through causing several close calls of dropping knives on the floor. I am returning this to messermiester in exchange for another one under their lifetime warranty in hopes of it being just an oversight
5,nice LOTR enviorment,this a pretty good set I like that it comes with saruman and wormtounge this gandalf isnt the best but it is okay over this is a great set.PS thisis the only way to get saruman and wormtounge
3,"Great graphics, and entertaining...","This game is definitely worth trying out... and at first it plays great, and you can have a blast, especially when matching parts, colors and such, which are all customizable, until you reach the later levels when the game starts getting a bit hard and extremely frustrating. Count on repeating a level lots of times to beat it... it gets hard to control your car at high speeds and they cheaply increase difficulty simply by planting traffic in front of you... EVEN in drag races. I was under the impression that racers blocked off streets for drag races? Not so in this game. Hitting traffic will be very high on your list of reasons for restarting the races... If you like a challenge and have plenty of patience this game is 100% for you. If you think it's cool but see yourself punching a hole in the wall after having traffic appear in your path and sending you spinning out of the race... RENT it for a console first."
3,Wishing it had more information,"Just returned from Tuscany and used the book extensively. Here's what I found. THE GOOD POINTS: The hotel and restaurant recommendations were excellent (although one particular hotel in which I stayed based on the book, which was called a ""Haven"" was just ok). Each city and chapter was broken down nicely with fine points and attractions that I used extensively. THE BAD POINTS: Although there were many, many wineries, and their phone numbers, and maps detailing the countryside in which they were located, the SPECIFICS were horrible. Never on any of the highlighted routes on the maps does it POINT OUT where these wineries are actually LOCATED, and on several occasions I was lost beyond belief trying to find them (even though I had made appointments). That made for a very frustrating wine tour, and considering this is a wine tour book, it needed to be more specific."
5,winetraveler in Toscany can't do without.....,We found the book in our rented hous in Toscany. We were located in the middle of the Chianti Classico area. We follewed one of the trips in the book and we saw one of the best castellos in the Chianti: Castello di Brolio. Absolutely fantastic.
3,Interesting ......to someone who loves economics.,"An interesting, quick, easy to read summary of some novel thinking about how economics affects our every day lives. I've bought several excellent used cars in my life so I don't agree with all the analyses. Nevertheless, if you like economics, some passages are thought provoking."
2,so-so,"I was enticed by the review of this book in the Economist. However, reading it proved to be a disappointment."
5,Hidden order for the citizen,"Harford did a good job at writing a well organized book that gave citizens a decent education on the economics of everyday life.I don't agree with him on everything, but I especially appreciated his chapter educating people on why globalization makes both parties better off. His chapters on why China grew rich and why Cameroon is poor were very well done."
5,Great read,"If I'd known economics was this interesting, I'd have take some courses in it. Perhaps I still will.That was all I was going to write but a message has appeared saying one more word was required. In the spirit of Christmas, I have written several words. :)"
3,Economics for Dummies,"This is modest guide to (and promotion of) free market economics which will be of interest to those who know nothing about the subject. Even then, someone in that position would do better to read Rose and Milton Friedman's ""Free to Choose.""I found the author's tone annoyingly confident and his expositions of anything complicated were incomplete and unconvincing."
2,Should have stayed undercover!,"I forced myself to read it after it was highly reccomended to me. It was a bit all over the place, had no ""glue"" and was overall boring. I still can't figure out why it's titled ""Undercover"" since nothing was revealed."
2,Dumb down more please ?,"Harford is obviously well read, well traveled and decent at explaining complex concepts. This book is 6th grade reading level, tops, and explains the obvious. I would rather have spent my $25 on numerous other things, like a good meal or $25 worth of coffee. If you understand nothing about economics or have a cursory understanding but lack common sense, then this is the book for you. Very disappointing."
4,Decent/Good Buy,Bought this book for a class and am pretty happy with it overall. Could use some more illustrations and it would be nice if the size of the book was a little larger than standard. Art History books are usually best when they have large pages.
5,Macedonian Language Course,This is an excellent language course for learning Macedonian. I highly recommend it.
5,Good (sharp!) knife,"This knife worked great for what I used it for, which was splitting large cake layers into two horizontal layers. My only word of caution is that it's extremely sharp, and easy to cut yourself on (I guess because it's so long and a little bit flexible). Do yourself a favor and order a large knife sheath at the same time."
4,"Good science, but kinda boring","This book has great derivations and explains concepts well. It has no colors and limited figures, though."
2,Another weird premise and wild allegations.,"Tim Matthews, a.k.a. Tim Hepple has a long history with the British National Party and believes that all `alien' technology and UFO sightings are the result of Nazi science. I've read excerpts of his book as he has posted several chapters and excerpts on the Internet and presented a lot of his material at UFO conferences here in London and around the UK on radio programs. The writing is poor quality and therefore hard to read. It jumps around a lot and many conclusions made by Hepple/Matthews are totally unsubstantiated. I suggest reading the best selling author, Jim Marrs `Alien Agenda' or `Unconventional Flying Objects' by Dr. Paul Hill, a NASA scientist."
3,Interesting...but...,"A fairly interesting book in its own right. However, Tim Matthews has obviously become a victim of a syndrome.Many UFO investigators who believe UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin fall into the trap.They end up victims of the ""I Want to Believe"" syndrome. Once ensnared many UFO investigators see alien UFOs everywhere.Unfortunately, Tim Matthews has become so immersed in the possible military origin of UFOs, he's fallen into the opposite trap, the ""I Want To Disbelieve"" syndrome.The ""key"" is to stay in the middle ground with a totally open mind and not be swayed one way or the other.It also has to be mentioned that most info in this book is common knowledge to anyone already involved in ufology."
5,Back To Grass Cutting!,Part was the same as OEM and fit like a glove! Perfect part...fast shipping...Thanks! PS couldn't believe I could find even the plastic cap on here!
3,"Content Great, CAN'T LISTEN TO IT ON MY CD PLAYER","It is no doubt MLK's speeches are great and did alotto shape American thinking. Unfortunately, I can onlyplay the first 2 CDs on my CD player. I have a friendwho has a CD player that can play all of them. Apparentlyit has something to do with the index numbering on eachCD. Instead of each CD starting at 1 it starts where the previous CD left off. I wouldn't take a chance that thisproduct won't play in your CD player. I think it is veryunfortunate that I paid so much for the complete set of speechesand I can't listen to most of it.I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT VERSION COMES OUT THAT CORRECTS THISFLAW.It would have been also nice to have some text to accompany theaudio CDs."
2,A Call to Conscience - MLK Jr.,"I was somewhat disappointed in this product. The sound quality on some of the speeches is pretty poor and amateurish. There is too much commentary and not enough of the speeches. Another cassette I had purchased before ""The Voice of Greatness"" ( which I believe you can find on Ebay in CD format) was much better."
5,SO BAD IT'S GOOD,This CD has something that is missing in popular music today...TALENT! A wonderful mix of songs both fun and thought provoking.

1,Not much use,"Read the book and an can confidently say that its of no help. In fact at points its quite ridiculous. As a person who has HAD a bad stammer and has nearly overcome it, this book was a waste of time"
5,Battery for RC,"What can you say about a battery, my grandson was pleased to get a battery and charger for his RC and that is good enough for me."
3,"Not bad, not great",The device was easy to set up and did what it was advertised to do. It only supports FAT16/32 and is a bit slow (10/100). I wouldn't recommend this for large external HDDs or transferring large files via network simply because of speed and you may lose that large file in the transfer. It works just fine moving documents and spreadsheets.
1,Manions Of America,"I ordered a ""three"" cassette set of the mini series ""Manions of America"". I received a ""one"" cassette, extendedplay movie. I viewed it on two different video players and the quality was terrible, adequate tracking was impossible and the images were fuzzy. The second time I tried to watch the movie, the tape inside broke! I am very dissatisfied with the product and I will not be ordering any more items in the future. Please remove me from your contact list.'"
5,Lifehouse`s Debut,"My band and I always wanted to play the music of lifehouse. With this book we have finally worked out a band score for Simon, Somewhere in between and Everything! It was really really helpful to us. Thank you Cherrylane"
1,This what u call poor song selection,Half of this album isn't even Crue classics!!! This isn't even a best of in my opinion!!! How could the Crue let this happen. I mean this is the worst best of I have ever seen. Everyone skip this this unless u want to use it as a toy for your dog or as a frisbie!
4,Hello? Smoking in the Boy's room?,"If this had smoking in the Boy's room and Dr. Feelgood, then this collection would be perfect. Still their best compilation yet."
4,Last Chance,"This is perhaps as good an outing as any by an Oscar-led combo post-1970. A comparison of this recording with live sessions made 6-7 years later will confirm that the earlier date was one of the last times Oscar's chops were as responsive as his spirit was willing. No small amount of the session's success is due to the rock-solid percussion work of Bobby Durham, one of the few drummers capable of keeping up with Oscar and Ray. One of the highlights is the unaccompanied, pyrotechnical exchange between Peterson and Ellis on ""Sweet Georgia"" (Oscar wins, but Herb counterpunches with surprising virtuosity)."
2,Cheap,Cute and inexpensive bellyring. Beware if you leave it in while showering it tarnishes & turns black within a week. I guess you get what you pay for..
3,Not the hottest of the Latin Ladies DVDs,"This is a decent Playboy DVD, but it doesn't quite contain the same sizzle as the more recent Playboy Lusty Latin Ladies DVD.This DVD does contain 16 video segments, each ranging in length from 2 to 4 minutes. Playmate hottie Maria Checa hosts this DVD, and appearances are also made by Playmates Samantha Torres and Stacy Sanches. The rest of the ladies come from their respective Latin countries, such as Peru, Spain, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, etc.If you're a big fan of Latin ladies, this is a worthy pickup. Most of the girls pose nicely for the camera, but the Lusty Latin Ladies contains more provocative shots and a couple of girl-on-girl scenes, which none are present here. Some segments were just way too short at 2 minutes.I originally bought this DVD, but I ended up selling it soon afterwards. Rent it first before considering to buy it."
4,From the Movie? I think not.,"While Swindle is a cool toy, he's not actually from the movie. He comes from the Transformers the movie video game. He has a fair amount of detail and fits right in with the movie toy line."
4,Loved it,I bought the book for a colleague in India and read it before I gave it to him. I like how the author explored the subject.
1,gift,i bought this as a gift for someone else i am not a gamer so i dont know anything about these video games
3,Healing Rain CD by Michael W. Smith,I did not think this CD was as good as the advertisement led you to believe. It did not grab my attention and I had to force myself to focus on the words and not the music. The music was a little overpowering compared to the singing.
5,Rowbike Rider,"Very seldom do I ever need this tool, but if you need it, it's worth much more the the price paid."
5,great band!,"Dizzy was a true master. He has spread his mastery onto countless numbers of people including all who are on this great cd. Jon Faddis is an extreme player. He plays high, low, loud, soft, fast, slow, furious, and beautiful. His highnotes are very controlled and have a great tone. The big disappointment of the cd is the fact that Slide Hampton does not solo. He arranges many of the songs and plays in the band, but has no improvisation. Steve Turre does take a couple of nice trombone solos.The arrangements by Slide are some of the best ever. Lush full orchestration with unique colors being used together.Roy Hargrove also plays in the band, as well as Lewis Nash, and Jimmy Heath. With them and other well known players, the band is truly an all star assembledge. All great Gillespie tunes made for a bebop big band(3sax,3tbone,3trpt,rhythm section). Worth twice as much as the asking price."
2,eh...,"i like lindsay lohan a lot, but this movie stunk. it was pretty cheesy and the only reason it was the slightest bit decent was because of the end and the moral of the movie. her really good movies are freaky friday and mean girls, so check them out!"
4,Teenage Angst !,"I saw this movie in the theater and loved it! It is true to life in the sense that almost every teenage girl has a fantasy life that she indulges in now and again. Althought this film is not Linsey's best work, The cast is good and despite the campy plot this film is still throughly enjoyable for the whole family."
4,An Awesome Film!!!,"I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and didn't like it too well. A few days ago, I saw it on tv and decided to give it a 2nd chance. I like it a lot better now, than when I saw it back in '04. Sexy beautiful Lindsay Lohan does an awesome job! She plays Mary ""Lola"" Stepp who is forced to move with her family to New Jersey. She makes friends with a girl named Ella, who loves the same band that Lola does, Sidarthur. They become really depressed when they find out that the band is breaking up, and try to go to their last concert. They get into a lot of crazy misadventures. I highly recommend CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE DRAMA QUEEN!!!"
1,"Yeah, Right","For your information, I can stand-- and sometimes even like-- bad movies but this was definitley a bad movie and I definitley didn't like it. It was completley unrealistic for one. I mean, who lets their teens, go to a rock concert by themselves and meet a drunken rock star?!?! Anyway, it's completely unrealistic ( point #2) in the fact that Lola becomes such great friends with her idol. The movie had no storyline until Lola and Ella went to the unrealistic concert. Instead of the heroine Disney intended her to be, she came off as a spoiled, over-the-top highschooler. This movie does not help if Lohan wants to be more popular than Duff. Go see ""Mean Girls"" instead."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!!!!!!!,"I thought that this product would be awesome because of all the sweet features included into the player, well I thought wrong!! the ""awesome"" device came to my house in non working condition. the cheaply and extremley light device almost ruined my usb drive when I tried charging the device which turned out to be a total waste of my time, and money. Now I have to wait 7-14 days while my return is being ""processed"""
4,good book,I learned alot from this book. The only thing i didnt like was the cd it came with. The cd said random terms so i couldnt read the terms as tehy say it to learn. And because it didnt go in order of the book i couldnt listen to words i wanted and didnt know how to say because there was no way of finding it on the cd. But the book was organized very well and easy to read.
3,Very choppy,"Let me first say that I am a fan of the first Max Payne, however, this is not the same quality game. The flow of the game is choppy (and I am talking about the speed and processing of the game not the game story). The story is not that great either. Finally, the graphics are ok, but there should be more interaction with Max's environment. In this game, like the last one, if you walk up to an object not needed by Max, the object just goes flying and is not very realistic."
1,Could be better,this game was just horrible....like its so easy and just incredibly short.theirs only like 4 parts...compared to the 8 in the 1st...the graphics are choppy and the plot sucks... im lucky i just rented it..dont buy it its not worth it....i expected alot more from rockstar seeing as they put out the great GTA games.The only good part was that their wasnt those retarded dream levels where u stay on the trail of blood......just horrible
2,Poor sequel,This game is little to no improvement upon the first. There are practically no new moves that can be used in bullet time and the graphics are a poor quality. The story is weak and predicatable. Rent this game before buying or you will likely be regretting a $50 purchase.
3,Be Careful What You Wish For...,"The dark side of celebrity and the disillusionment that often accompanies the achievement of one's dreams underscore the narrative of entertaining but trite ""Cover Girl"".Narrated by understated teen beauty Renée Renshaw, the novel recounts Renée's brief foray into New York's elite modeling industry and the subsequent strain her new career places on her relationships with her mother, her best friend, and with her new boyfriend, scholarly Greg Neill, an avid outdoorsman with an inexplicable disdain for fashionable clothing, cosmetics, and other staples of the modeling world.Sweet and likeable, Renée's captivating narrative propels the story; she garners sympathy for putting up, not only with her overbearing mother and a bevy of condescending modeling executives and rude photographers, but with patronizing Greg, whose insistence that Renée be some granola nature girl, is one of the novel's few annoyances."
2,gloves need to be thicker,"the gloves need to be thicker, after washing dishes a few times they have holes in them. I really like using Mr. Clean products. I've purchased the latex free gloves before which were much thicker."
1,"Another ""Insight into the gospel that only a few see"" rehash","The author creates a system of thought based upon subjective messages from God (""God said I had another idol in my life so I said 'OK, God'"") and pick and choosing scripture for ornamentation. You would do better finding a book that teaches the meaning of scripture within their intended context.Yes, his point is well taken that the gospel is more that simply having your sins forgiven, but I haven't realistically found that to be a big problem among serious Christians in general. I guess the author sees it as a big problem because it took him so long to figure it out.These type of books have been around for years. They claim they have insight into the gospel that the church at large either hasn't seen, won't see, or can't see. The truth is, serious Christians have heard these things before but prefer books of gospel exposition that are more sound.There is a reason this is a small press (read self-published) job."
1,Nonsense!,"God's word is written and it is final. There is no ""rest of the Gospel"" SIN is only spelled one way. Its comical how these distinguished authors come up with all of these theories on how to be a Christian when God gives you understanding of his word by way of the Holy Ghost. John 14:26Proverbs Chap 3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil."
2,Lovely design but not well made,"This is a beautiful pillow and my daughter loves Snow White so it was a perfect Christmas gift, I thought. The pillow is a very soft velour-ish material, as is Snow White's face. Her stitching is beautiful, especially the eyes. However this item's main flaw is the ""collar"" part of her -- the white satin that is stitched into the pillow around her neck. Its a nice touch, but after a few weeks after receiving this item the poly-satin collar started to pull away from the pillow. My daughter didn't play roughly with this as it was an accent pillow for her bed. A month later, the entire collar on both sides has split from the pillow & I'm at a loss as to how to repair it. I certainly won't buy a replacement of the same kind. Very pretty pillow but unfortunately can't be used anywhere but in a display case."
4,"I Remember Duke, Hoagy & Strayhorn","I Remember Duke, Hoagy & Strayhorn~ Ahmad Jamal is a really nice recording from the great jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal. On this recording he is playing the likes of Ellington, Strayhorn and Hoagy. I am not a jazz expert but this is definetely likeable music and great music to relax after a hard work day. Grab a cold beer out of the fridge, take the cd and relax and enjoy the tunes. Highly recommended and it gets 4 well deserved stars."
3,cool,"this book is useful to those starting out in modeling. if you already have a contract i wouldnt reccomend it so much, but it has useful tips throughout, and anecdotes from real life models"
3,Works but should be better,"Although this item is sold as Ateco brand the one I received form an Amazon partner was made by Bakery Crafts. I also bought an Ateco large bowl scraper and it didn't suffer from the problem detailed below.This is just a simple piece of plastic. It's the right shape and size to held easily and scrape a bowl. Unfortunately the flashing from the molding process is still intact and gives the whole item a ring of sharp plastic edging. I sanded it down so it's better which was easy enough. Still, this is a bummer, even for a few dollar piece of plastic."
1,Incredibly disappointed,"I've seen a couple serious chefs talk about this product, so I went to Amazon to order it.I really need it for making dough, but I can hardly believe this is the product they are all using. It's incredibly cheap and uncomfortable to hold as the edges are so sharp they almost cut my hand. In fact, the plastic mould must not have been made right because the edges had pieces sticking out of it, almost like it was laminated. I had to take scissors and trim the plastic off the edges and try to make it less sharp.I've also found for many of my bowls it doesn't scrape it out properly because it's too big and not rounded enough.I don't really get it, all the great reviews. Sure, it's only a few bucks, but I did expect something that was manufactured decently, and at the least, was comfortable to hold in my hand.I can't help but think this is a knockoff of the actual Ateco product, but who knows. There are a couple other products here on Amazon that I'd like to try out instead."
4,"Good, general intro. to M.C. & I.B. industries.",Things I liked about the book: 1) Gives a good feel for exactly what Management Consultants and I. Bankers do. 2) Interviews provide good insight into corporate cultures. 3) Clear explanation of what recruiters are looking for. Where it could use improvement: 1) More and longer summaries of companies. 2) I wish it also covered IT positions in Investment Banks. Summary: A great introduction to I.B. and M.C. jobs. Superb place to start a job search.
5,This book saved my toddler's life.,"This book is the reason my 22 year old is still on this earth. The excellent section on pneumonia was powerful enough for me to confront the pediatrician who said she had a ""viral sore throat"" on two separate visits to his office within one week's time. The book made it clear she had pneumonia, and when he was asked by me to PROVE she did not have pneumonia, he ordered the chest x-ray. He found one of her lobes was completely filled with pneumonia. Without this book there would have been a funeral. Every mom should own this book. Please do not be afraid to question and challenge doctors. They are not ""gods."" They are human and this book will help you be informed about critical situations involving the health of your children.God bless the author, Jack G. Shiller, M.D."
5,Learn to pour your heart out to God,"Michael Card is more than a gifted Christian singer-songwriter, he's also a wonderful author and teacher. Let the words of this book and the accompanying scriptures move you to express all that is in year heart, not just the ""good"" things you think God wants to hear, but also what is in the shadows -- fear, anger, pain, frustration, sadness.... Pouring your heart out to God could very well take your relationship with God to new heights!"
5,Great Live Album by Hamp,"Just got this cd today and I came in expecting a great cd and this what I got. Hamp is at his best during this cd with songs like Flyin Home, Hamp's Boogie Woogie, and Hamp's Note. If you like high engery jazz then this cd is for you."
4,"Nonpretentious Brain Candy,","And all the better for it!The book stars a couple of cops in the narcotics division of the NYPD and their fight with a group of Predators. There are not a lot of surprises or twists in the plot, but it is no less fun as a result of those absences. It is a fun read, and it is short enough for a plane trip, a couple hours on the beach, or just a short evening on the couch in front of the fireplace and radio.In short, if you like Predator (not the second movie, it [was bad]), and you wanted a bit more action, pick this up. You won't be disappointed. If you are looking for something that requires a little bit of thought, keep looking you haven't found it yet. But, like I said, great for a two-hour brain-break. Enjoy!Harkius"
3,"noisy, ragged, grating...","Listening to the version of Watusi here just made me appreciate more the studio version on Angels & Demons At Play. OSEA is noisy, too much outside free for alls... ok, maybe there is a lot of discipline and technique involved, fine, so simply calling it noise would not be fair, but the effect, regardless, is that it sounds like a bunch of noise. And the recording quality on this album is quite spotty.Well, this is my initial impression, maybe the album will grow on me. But I have a number of other Sun Ra albums, all of which I'd rank much higher than this one. Get this one only if you're such a Sun Ra completist and you already have all his other stuff. Otherwise, I recommend skipping it..."
3,I Must Have Missed Something ...,"I agree with Chuang-san and Mr. Boone. This book is a fun quick kanji study, but it's also a powder-keg. I have lived in Japan for 10 years, and I must say that I find it surprising that anyone with a name created in the West who knows anything about the Japanese, would attempt to translate his or her name into kanji at all.My friends, neighbors, co-workers, business contacts, and government officials (including the Post Office) here assure me that ""western"" names and terms are most properly written in katakana, which is precisely the syllabary the Japanese use for reading or pronouncing them correctly. I'm sticking with them!Kanji is decidedly more beautiful than the English alphabet, and may be okay for a little bit of a show-off factor in the US or Europe for something decorative that will serve to impress or intrigue, but please do not delude yourself that it will actually work should any Japanese chance to see it, and as Chuang-san alludes, may possibly offend."
5,1 of the greatest games ever.,Now listen i'm tired of hearing about all of the insults and rips on this game. For starters Max Payne will put his foot straight up vercetti's ass. This game should be made into a movie it's just that great. It still has the great graphics and yeah the graphics are great sorry if you people can't get the d**k out of your eye to see that. And one of the greatest things ever the slow motion diving that every other game keeps copying off of but still won't be as great. People seriously i'm going to be dead straight with you this game is awesome! Now Max Payne 2 still has the same great dark and suspensefulness that it had in the first one. Don't get me wrong i know you've been hearing it's shorter than the first but still packs the same great punch!! It's 1 of the best games ever any REAL gamer would know that!!! Buy it if you don't have it i swear you won't be dissapointed.
4,Kicks GTA Vice Cities Ass,I dont want to spoil anything but everything about this game is awesome. I don't know about you but in my opinion this game is better than GTA Vice City. Just go get the game and you will not be disappointed.
4,Make a game in which I can just kill everything...OK...good.,"Even if dumbed-down from the PC version, the physics in this game are really slick. Shoot at the pop can, hit the pop can, pop can fly, pop can spin, pop can land and make crunch noise. Shoot at the villian, hit the villian, villain fly, villain spin, villain land and say, ""Noooo,"" or, ""Aaarghhh!""Max Payne 2's story, characters, and level design are all engrossing and improved from those of the preceding game, as well. A brilliant little gem of a game. It gets four stars because it only takes 6-7 hours and there is no replay value whatsoever. (...)"
4,Best Storyteller,"The album's producer described this collection of songs perfectly. Johnny Cash's voice is both strong and struggling, depending on the notes and phrases he belts out.There is no other artist that can break an audience's heart just by listening to the telltale words of the song stories.The most refreshing part of Johnny Cash's music is that he covers song titles so well that I forgot who the original artists were."
5,RIP Johnny,"This is a truly great album. In 100 years time there will still not be anyone that expresses humankind's shortcomings, regrets, sadness and happiness the same way as the late great Johnny Cash did in song. The voice is fighting to breath at times in songs like ""if you could read my mind"" but never once loses any of the power and emotion that we have come to love from the great man. Thank you Johnny and Rick Rubin for bringing out such powerful and brilliant music, anyone who appreciates music that comes from the soul should buy this album."
4,Coda,"Okay, firstly I'm not going to give it 5 stars. I'm not going to lower it to the level of a ""Formulaic production"" either. Yes, some of the criticisms of the album are valid. There are some weak spots. There's nothing quite to the level of Hurt (from The Man Comes Around). But I dare you to listen to ""If You Could Read My Mind"" without getting a lump in your throat.I think it's a fitting ending. He sounds as if he knows that the end is near, and he is reluctantly accepting that. I know that I am better for having heard the entire American Recordings series, and I thank Mr. Rubin releasing this epilogue."
5,"His Latest, Maybe His Last and one of His Best.","American V: A Hundred Highways ... A great CD for the hard-core fans of J. Cash and great music for those who love the rough poetry of one of the best C&W; ""interpreters of life"". The Cash written pieces are worth the price of the album alone; the ""covers"", although seemingly out of place on this collection, are sung in the unique style that cannot be copied - ever.Syd Grant"
5,Served My Purpose!,Needed to order this Fan to install in my furnace to move air through my humidifier to enhance its humidity output. Works very well for such an application. Quality manufactured as it runs all the time (during winter months) for my useage and is still going strong. Great value for the purchase price.
3,You will need your own power cord,"I had purchased this item as a fan for a hydroponic grow tent and was originally dismayed when it arrived and did not have a power cord, just three wires: green, black, and white. I took a spare PC power cord, cut off the end that plugs into the PC and stripped the internal wires off. The color on each of the 3 internal wires matches the wires on the fan. I then used 3 all-weather winged wire nuts that I purchased for a few dollars at my local home improvement store to join the wires. I connected the power cord into a DuctStat to control the fan. I am using a low-heat LED array based grow light so I did not need high througput airflow and my grow tent has a 6"" opening at the top that this fan fit into perfectly. I used a 6"" duct clamp to secure it place. This has been an inexpensive solution, my second choice product was over three times the price."
1,Holster,"The holster was supposed to fit a Glock 19, it did not even come close. I have other Uncle Mike's holsters that work fine."
2,"Good Code, Terrible Explanations","I am using this book in a class on Data Structures and Algorithms. This book has a lot of material and code in it which makes it good. However, his explanations are terrible. They are ambiguous and unclear. If you can teach yourself from the code, then this is a good book for you. If your looking for clear explanations, look somewhere else."
4,The Changing Kibbutz,"This is a provocative exploration of the gains and losses sustained by the kibbutz movement in relation to Israel's tumultuous history and fragmented culture. The author, who has experienced years of communal life as both a kibbutz member and now a moshavnik, has a great deal to say about ideology, continuity, and the fragile dream of the Zionist communal movement. A well-written and exciting collection of stories."
3,Chicago Bears Santa Hat,It's big for my head! But I still wore it for Christmas. One of those things I just had to have!
2,Surf the Web INSTEAD!,"I purchased a hairless Chinese Crested. First, I read this book. The 8 week old pup I had flown to me developed coccidia (stress of weaning, leaving mom, travel, new home, new owners) after two days, which then led to hypoglycemia (stopped eating and blood sugar crashed) and died within one week. This book doesn't stress the fact that ""toy"" puppies can easily have this problem and what to do at the early signs to save its life. Unfortunately, my Vet didn't know what to do either. I learned from surfing the web, after the problem. That would be your best bet to learn about this breed, including possible problems that the book does not cover."
1,Crap,Four boring remixes littered with awful noises and no evolution of the main melody. A complete waste of money and a definite do-not-buy. Check out Paul Oakenfold's Song to the Siren-Fable Mix on his Another World CD for a great interpretation of this wonderful song. There and none on this frisbee.
3,just 3,"This is the first book I read by this author.I found it to be lagging a bit and hard to get into.I found myself struggling and just wanted to jump to the end so I wouldn't have to read anymore.Overall it was a cute book and a cute story line. With the 'fairytale' stuff I thought would make it even better, but instead it just frustrated me."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Wig sucks. The teeth don't even fit into your mouth, and they make the entire costume! So disappointed I bought this product. Now I am in the hole, and have no Halloween costume:/"
4,Heaven Is Television,"I think that the last words of the first song on this CD ""I Sell Love"" are heaven is television, which is a pretty sound commentary on life in the 21st century U.S. of A. I have to admit up front that I know Gian, one of Mink Lung's guitarists, from his hometown and while you might think that that makes me biased, I have to tell you that I hate most of the music people from here put out. That said, I am amazed just how good Mink Lungs have gotten so fast. I saw an early gig under a tent kind of thing on the beach and they were pretty raw. Forget that now, this is the real thing, smart, hooky, and loads of fun. My wife hates the CD which is always a good sign."
5,Gods audio visual aids..dioramas and life like displays...,"Better Button is amazing. Slower, more acoustic than their second album...but undeniably great. The Better Button captures a feeling and sound that i am sorry nay sayers...it's original. I was 35 when i heard this (i think) and have been collecting all kinds of music forever. The Mink Lungs did something profoundly original here. If just lyrically. I'll Take It does swing closer to mainstream but ...hell..not much, and the vocals on both albums and the construction of the backing vocals and arrangements is perfect. Oh Bless Ye the LUNGS!!!! Come back from your hiding place in brooklyn Tim...we know you are there. if you haven't bought this CD yet listen to the wonders of Blue and Creme Car!"
5,"I Love This Power Supply (Good, Christian, Unconsummated Love)","This is a rock-solid supply that I've used to shore up countless big box computers whose cruddy power supplies have failed in the week after their warranty has expired. Don't be daunted by the low wattage, is 350W is plenty for most family web browsers. (Check for the Antec Basiq 430W if you want a bit more insurance.)"
2,Noisy!!!!!,"No power supply from a company with as good of reputation as Antec should be this noisy. It's louder than my refrigerator! I'd return it if it wasn't such a pain to install a PSU, but be forewarned, it is NOISY!!!! Otherwise, fine, it's a good power supply, which is hard to get excited about in any case."
3,disappointment ; did not work in 7 yr old emachine.,I am dissapointed.This PSU was a super price for 350w'.Installed to replace the OEM dead PSU in eMachines.Multimeter-test confirms the BP350 was out of tolerance on the 012v rail.YMMV
1,Not good,"This PSU arrived looking good. Appeared solid/well made, nice cords, modular is always nice, etc. Hooked it up with no problems, replacing an old PSU in a known good system. It ran fine for two hours, then died. Tried switching to known good cords, outlets, etc, nothing worked. Tried the paper clip test with just a fan plugged in, nothing. Completely dead."
5,power supply,"The old Dell computer kept shutting off over and over, so I guessed it was the power supply. This was my first time at a repair like this. It went well, and it fixed the computer. It now is running fine. I also guessed at picking this one. Turned out just great."
1,"Ordered new unit, received Refabricated unit from ANTOnline","Never fire up unit. Placed an order for a new unit, received refabricated unit. Returned unit paying for return postage at ANTOnline's instructions. No attempt by ANTOnline to correct mistake or pay for return postage. Amazon made me financially well. Cost about four more days before computer repaired."
1,This author has no understanding of basic science.,"Dwight K. Nelson deserves a star for sincerity, which influences readers who have limited education, particularly in the sciences. He gives a creationist's view of evolution with the main explanation being ""Satan established a belief in evolutionary development over long ages and thus destroyed a belief in Creation and in the Creator."" So beware of that nasty little dickens, Satan, or he might make you believe anything."
5,Best Dog Conditioner,"This product is concentrated,but works as an outstanding hydrating conditioner. Easy to use and you can comb through with no tangles.Delivery was fast and will be my stand by product."
4,Educating Black Resistance,"Does tracking in our public schools isolate children, keeping them from reaching their potential? How do first generation, black immigrants handle tracking? These are some of the questions R. Patrick Solomon attempts to answer in his ground breaking book, Black Resistance in High School.Useing multicultural education theory from one of the pioneers, John U. Ogbu, Salomon shows how first generation West Indies immigrants rebel against school authority in Toronto Canada. Salomon's style of ethnographic writing combined with controversial theory make for an eye opening read.Black Resistance in High School is a must for every student of education and anthropology."
1,Poor navigation,"GPS always told me address was on the wrong side of the road. One day, miles from water it told me "" you must now take a ferry"". Threw it away."
3,Okay for Beginners,"I was required to get this book for a second year German class and was quite disappointed with it, as it wasn't thorough enough for my tastes. This would be a useful book for someone who doesn't have much basic knowledge of German grammar, but is not the all inclusive book that I wanted. It does get through a lot of concepts without bogging down the learner with every rule on the particular type of grammar that isn't likely to come up in simple interaction. I would recommend Hammer's German Grammar to anyone who would like extremely thorough coverage of German grammar."
5,wow!,"when my wife and i first saw this movie, we were riveted. at the end, we looked at one another & said 'wow - did we see what i think we saw??' we have seen it 4 times, and now we're buying it. (we know no one else who's seen it.) it is a facinating story, and we've never seen anything else like it. i thought the acting was excellent, the story superb, & cinematography wonderful. the movie had even more impact with each viewing. another non-mainstream love story we are waiting for availability is 'under the lighthouse dancing' (australia), also 5 stars."
5,a beautiful romance with excitement and adventure,"I don't usually care for romantic movies, but this film is an exception. It is a very touching and moving love story and has other fascinating characteristics too. The bombing of Dresden was an incredible part of the movie.The most amusing part was when the nun in catechism class used her pointer to show where Heaven was for good Catholics43, vs Hell where heretics and Protestants go."
3,What I thought of it,"I liked this flim. I thought it was moving and interesting. I thought the father was a bastard, but hey that is my opinion alone. I like Jason Scott Lee as an actor anyway and he really doesn't make bad films. Although he has been in some."
2,Disappointed,"You know one of those reference books you buy but no matter how often you look at it it never has the answer to your questions? Yes? Well this book is one of those.As a professional software developer I never had much use for Que books - thick paper, too much white space, and big fonts. This book is no exception. I made the mistake of buying it on the strength of the reviews at Amazon but it lives up to the Que tradition of being a book full of basic information, most of which is available in the SQL server docs. Sure it has lots of examples but little that is very enlightening.I didn't get the impression here that this was a basic book but it is. It is going to be a disappointment to you if you, like me, already know SQL/DBMS programming but from another database product. If I was starting out then maybe I'd find it of use, but a one-stop answer to all you SQL Server problems it most definitely is not. If I ever find it useful I will come straight back here and change this review."
5,"Excelent, the best you can buy !!!","I have been working more than four years with SQL Server, since version 6.5. In my work I have to cover all the funcionality in SQL Server as I am developer, administrator and so on. I have few SQL books as I find is quite simple to find almost anything in the BOLs.But this book is the best I have ever seen to get into SQL Server and improve your skills, from the point of view of a developer there is not better book. It is also a incredible source of information for experts, it really explores all the new features you can find in SQL Server 2000.I also know the two authors's work as they help many people in the SQL forums and I can say they are really good.Enjoy it!!!"
3,Running Out of Steam,"If this weren't a Richard Jury novel, I don't think I would have gotten more than halfway. The plot pretty much left me cold. I'll have to say, though, that during a climactic scene where Jury puts his career and safety on the line, my heart was pounding.Other than a few exciting moments, the book was pretty dull and the solution to one of the mysteries totally unconvincing. And is anyone besides me so sick of Jury's neighbor Carol-Anne that they hope she is a future murder victim?All that keeps me going on this series is seeing what goes on with Jury's personal life. Melrose and his compatriots have become completely tiresome, although his hiring of a hermit gave me the only laugh in the book."
3,Not the best in the series,"Martha Grimes is back with another entry in the Richard Jury series. This book revolves around three murders, a little girl shot found shot the in the head, the death of Jury's cousin, his last living relative, and the death of a strange woman found in the garden of house named Angel Gate. The owner of the Angel Gate's young stepdaughter vanished three years ago, but is not the little girl who was found shot.Much of this story is introspective for Richard Jury as he examines his feelings about the death of his cousin who he had really never liked in life. That part of the book was very slow moving for me and ultimately did not work. Melrose Plant, a fixture in many prior Jury books was brought into this story, but seemed to be so extraneous that it seemed ridiculous. If you a fan of Richard Jury, then I would recommend reading it, but for others the prior Jury novels are much better. This one was a bit of a chore to get through."
2,Not her best...,"I LOVE the Richard Jury series and always look forward to the usual cast of characters; you won't find much of most of them in this book. The Winds of Change did not have much pub time or comedic relief so there was really no time or place for the RJ gang. Also, the plot is not complicated and a bit of a stretch but I still recommend reading as fans will want to keep up with RJ personal updates and it is fine vacation type reading. Hoping the Black Cat will be better."
5,Jury finds himself in a whole new puzzle,"Fans of Martha Grimes will relish the return of the sage Superintendent Richard Jury, who in Winds Of Change has recovered from his near death at the end of the last adventure and now finds himself on a new case involving a deceased family member. Striking a little too close to home for comfort is the murder of a child and once teamed up with Brian Macalvie and his old pays, Jury finds himself in a whole new puzzle."
3,Not one of her best,"Even though Grimes has done a great job incorporating all our favorite characters into this Richard Jury novel, it is not one of her best.Jury does too much ruminating (more than in many of her other Jury books). Enough is enough. Even though the book is about missing children there is an irrelevant child at every turn, some dead some alive. It's as if most of us have kidnapped children in our families. How much analysis of childhood do we need in one book?She also could have written the same story without the upleasant details about child abuse and predators. This seemed to be just a tool thrown in unnecessarily for the shock value.Not a bad book overall, but again, not one of her better ones."
2,Letters was very disappointing,"I have read most of the Austen spin-offs and found this to be the worst. While I appreciated the attempts to remain in the Jane Austen style, I felt that there were so many attempts to quote the previous novel and draw in characters from other novels that the plot was sadly lacking. I was anxiously awaiting this after the previous reviews, but was left shaking my head. I wondered if they had read the same book. I would suggest any other spins before this book."
3,Average,I like the premise. It was a good read but just not a great read. If you haven't had the experience of reading a novel like this I would go for it but it's just not as exciting as I had hoped.
1,Don't waster your time!,"Although the writer says she is not Jane Austen, she uses Austen's vocabulary and expands on Austen's story line, completely stripping it of any interesting turns of events or any elements of surprise, shock, or true delight. The literary genius is missing. The letters are dull and monotonous. It is a real effort to turn the pages. You keep hoping for something more and you keep getting more of the same thing.If you have read all of Jane Austen's books and you wish to read similar literature, start with Anne Radcliffe (1764-1823) and you'll find yourself reading all of her books also. Radcliffe was a favorite of Austen's!"
3,Moderately interesting,"One of my all-time favorite books is Pride & Prejudice. While this book often sounds very much like Jane Austen, it's because Dawkins has lifted that author's words and characters from various novels and stitched them together as Lizzy's thoughts -- not all of them in character. There are good moments and it's sometimes fun to try to determine who the characters are, but in the end, it's just playing in Austen's world with midling success. Lizzy's voice is often right, but not always her actions (as related) and thoughts. It's not a bad read, just less than fulfilling."
2,Terribly boring. . .,"I wish now that I had followed the advice of the other reviewers. This was a quick read, but boring. Nothing of interest happens in the letters to Jane from Elizabeth. As a sequel, it would be better to read Bar Sinister or Presumption. The book could not stand up on its own as a literary work."
3,Lacking in Imagination,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was disappointed when I finished reading it. I did enjoy it, and will probably read it over and over again, but all the characters in the book were so palpably from other Jane Austen books, it was like reading bits and pieces of ""Emma"", ""Sense and Sensibility"", and others by her. The characters' names were even taken from the other books or from Jane Austen's life. I thought that the book could have had a little more imagination in its writing. I was hoping for something creative and new, not a collage of other books by Jane Austen."
5,A great book!,"I found this a very intresting andentertaining book, a greatconclusion to the novel ""Pride and Predjudice!"
4,An Excellent Read for Austenites,"I gave this novel four stars, not five, because I had to compare it to the grandeur of Pride and Prejudice--no sequel can be as wonderful. Any fan of Austen's works should take the time to read this, one of the better continuations of Austen's novels. I found it to be very accurate to Austen's style as well as appropriate to the time period. Another nice feature of the novel was the addition of characters from other Austen works--overall, it was an excellent read."
3,Milton's Paradise Lost--essentially a recording,"The description of the video--""John Milton's Paradise Lost performed by John Basinger""--caused me to believe that different people would be recitingthe lines of the epic: that is, we would hear Adam and Eve and Raphael and Michael and Satan and the fallen angels. However, the production is really a recording of John Basinger reading the epic Paradise Lost. I had intended to show the film to my class, but will not do so."
3,Good not Great.,"It is a good little animated movie. It is not up to par with previous Justice League movies, but it is fairly enjoyable."
4,another great DC effort,"i gotta say, DC continues to impress with their animated offerings.iliked everything about this latest offering.not only was the storyreally good,but the voice acting was stellar in my mind.the fightscenes were spectacular,but they didn't overpower the rest of themovie.i also really liked the opening title sequence.i thought itreally stood out.the movie also had a dark edge to it,which i reallyliked.definitely adult oriented,which suits me fine.all i can say is ihope they keep up the quality and make sure the movies continue to havethe adult edge to them.as an aside,there's a great bonus short includedcalled The Spectre,which i recommend watching as well.for me,JusticeLeague: Crisis on Two Earths is a 4/5"
3,Really Lackluster Once You View It Twice,"I somewhat enjoyed ""Public Enemies"", and ""Under the Red Hood"" is by far the best feature ever, but this edition really could have used some work. It has the same problems as a lot of its predecessors, delivering solely action and a pretty basic plot outline of the much deeper graphic novel. This was pathetic to me, because the premise was pretty promising. Not only that, but Batman spends 90% of his time in the movie getting his ass handed to him, which was insulting really. Chris North, Mark Harman, and William Baldwin, all were decent, but nothing compared to Kevin Conroy or Tim Daly. Although give credit where credit is due concerning James Hood, who did pretty damn good throughout as Owlman.If you're around 10 this will be the best thing you've ever seen, but if you were born in the 90s or older then it will pass off as mediocre."
1,Not as good as JL or JLU,"Justice League: Worlds Collide was no failure, contrary to the review above. The Justice League and Justice League Unlimited was an excellent culmination of fifteen years of continuity, which began with Batman: The Animated Series.Like all the other ""replacements"" to the original DCAU, it simply doesn't hold up. There was a magic with the animation and casting that has yet to be matched in these newer straight to video releases.Marvel's works aren't even a consideration, severaly lackluster. In this instance, DC is competing with itself. And these reboots stink.Perhaps Bruce Timm can't capture lighting in a bottle twice? Or perhaps he should resurrect the JLU cast and animation? I favor the latter."
1,Disappointment,"When I placed the order for this item, I was expecting to receive in my mailbox, a dvd cover with TWO dvds inside, instead I get one dvd disk with SPECIAL FEATURES on it and a slip of paper giving instructions how to download the movie to a computer. I was very disappointed with this particular transaction.Hopefully the seller of this item won't short change anyone else with this misleading discription again. For the sake of other people, I'm going to keep this product if only to save another unsuspecting buyer from being short-changed again like I was again.But I'm very very disappointed with this transaction."
4,Not quite epic,"Title says most of it. The movie is good, but not epic. Voice acting was great, loved Owlman (James Woods). Also Superman (Mark Harmon) did a great job. What seemed lacking, and perhaps a bit of a personal bias, was not enough Superman, too much Batman."
1,Not Worth It,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The moves are boring and corny, and the instructor did not really inspire me at all. Also the music was horrible. I don't like to say negative things about other's creative works, but this is not worth the money."
1,where to start...,"The authors advice is extremely outdated for one. Prices, financing and sophistication levels of sellers have reached light speed since the author started investing. He is not a very good author to boot. Disorganized and scattershot would classify his writing style. If you like listening to Grandpa talk about the 'good ol days' then maybe this book is for you."
2,good thing it wasnt TOTAL crap,"alright i normally despise MTV b/c of all their mainstream crap, but im glad they got two good christian bands (demon hunter, as i lay dying) on there. and killswitch engage. it gives you a good glimpse into the realm of christian hardcore and metal, the true metalheads who know that you dont have to cuss to be hardcore. if you dont believe me download inferno by extol, or ember by extol, or undeceived by extol, or time stands still by extol, etc...or soul embraced, zao, living sacrifice, still breathing (female vocalist), crimson moonlight, crimson thorn, acoustic torment, the list goes on."
5,The mix too defeat all mix's,"I remember when I walked into a K mart one day a few years back and noticed this cd. I had no idea that they had had a mix for the Headbanger's Ball TV Show. Well, I look at the back too checkout the tracklisting and I was thrilled. Folks!! this IS modern metal (Unlike the Headbanger's Ball: Revenge stuff), this is why people like us play the instruments that we do and why we go to the shows that we go to. I can't even begin too start. Awesome tracks that go from bands like Hatebreed to Godsmack, from Cold to Devildriver and from Mudvayne to Cradle of Filth. It's as phenominal as the show. My favorite track of course is without a doubt Devildriver's - ""I could careless""."
3,An OK compilation,"I got this compilation because I like Headbanger's Ball.Disc 1 is more nu-metal type stuff and Disc 2 is more death metal type-stuff.The high points of Disc 1 are Godsmack,Hatebreed,Staind,Ill Nino,Killswitch Engage,Slayer,Anthrax,Shadows Fall and Murderdolls.As for disc 2,I don't like death metal for the most part but I did enjoy some of this disc.I liked Arch Enemy,In Flames,Chimaira,Lacuna Coil,DevilDriver and Unearth.Volume 1 is overall a little better than volume 2,but they are both good.If you like real heavy death metal,start with Volume 2."
3,"Read the earlier book, Game Set and Match First","This is the second in a trilogy ...Game, Set and Match Mixed Doubles Summer of SecretsThis is a great follow-up, the evil Ace falls just one woman!"
3,Close but no cigar!,"Standout tracks: WHY WE THUGS, CHILD SUPPORT(of course!), GROWIN UP, THE N---A TRAP, STOP SNITCHING, GO TO CHURCH(minus Lil Jon), CLICK CLACK GET BACK, SMOKE SOME WEED, etc. Filler: Doin what it pose 2do, The game lord, Chrome and Paint, Steal the show, You gotta lotta that(The most boring collabo this side of Puffy!), Spittin pollaseed(WTF is that?)and Holla @ cha boy. The main point is this is not the same Ice Cube that used to scare the panties off of mainstream america. You have to pick up every album prior to the War and Peace albums to hear that Ice Cube.This album is a nice companion piece compared to his early works. But as flawed as this album is its one of the highlight albums of 2006."
3,new west coast album from legend,"Not too much sampling from contributing producers which is good. Lil Jon produced tracks are weak and sound very similar. Scott Storch gives an instant banger with ""Why We Thugs"" and Cube's delivery is intense and potent as always. Not many guest appearances. ""Child Support"" is another banger that puts all the young ""rappers"" in their place. Cube puts himself on a pedestal above typical rap commonly heard today and rightly so. He's been in the game since like 1988, part of NWA, invented gangsta rap, consistent career, and has one of the best deliveries of any MC ever. Oh and how many years is that and millions of albums sold?"
3,West Up!!!,"Cube took his time with this album and I see why. The subject matter changes but stays solid throughout the album. And instead of making his rhymes fit big time producer tracks, he made them fit their beats around his rhymes. This album is better than War and Peace album.Plenty of hip-hop quotables throughtout this complete album. Not to many guest appearances. What I really like is he kept it ole' school but at the same time it is new school enoough for these young cats. Theres still a message in his music, glad to see that hasn't changed. This that real S*it check the album out. Hotep."
5,A great contribution to an understudied field,"Democracy's Privileged Few is a careful, well-documented, and important study of an underappreciated topic in constitutional law. The legislative privileges protected by our Constitution are rarely discussed in courts, but they represent some of the most fundamental requirements of democratic self-government. Spanning from modern bribery scandals to freedom of speech, the power of Congress to imprison ordinary citizens, and medieval conflicts between the King and Parliament, Democracy's Privileged Few is an excellently written account of how legislative privilege emerged in the British Constitution and survived (or evolved) in the U.S. Constitution. Anyone with an interest in the foundations of American government would do well to read this book."
4,FUNCTIONAL BUT...,"I bought this bag for my Canon Powershot SX210. It is my first time to own a Tamrac brand camera bag.I like the buckle/clasp instead of zipper to close up/secure the camera in the bag. I thought it is a little quicker to get the camera in and out. There is a separate compartment for my spare battery and SD card and there is room for another spare battery and SD card. Then there is the compartment for the camera. The liner has slippery, silky feel to it. It should not scratch the camera. The padding appear to be sufficient for protection and the outside material is rugged that I think will withstand everyday use and could handle abuse.I only gave it 4 stars because it is not a snug fit for my camera. The bag is is a little taller and wider. It also looks a little blah to me compared to Lowepro bags I previously owned. I bought another camera bag - Lowepro Apex 30 AW. It is a better fit and looks better for my taste. I gave my Tamrac to my brother and he seems to like it alot."
5,"EXCELLENT for compact Point & Shoots, Great for Advanced Shooters/Pros if you use S.A.S.","I'm a Professional Photographer & I got this to use for my Point & Shoot with Tamrac's S.A.S. (Strap-On Accessory System). This simply means you can strap it to the shoulder strap of S.A.S. compatible Tamrac shoulder bags, for quick & easy access. This Camera Bag is perfect for my Canon PS-A3300-IS. It has nice little zip pockets in the front that hold my many back-up batteries & extra memory cards. (Could hold other small accessories as well.) Comes with a shoulder strap with metal hooks, if you just want to use it as a stand-alone case. My 10+ years of experience with many Tamrac products is that they almost always hold up to the elements, & protect your equipment like no other products I've experienced...I highly recommend!"
3,Good Info but...,"It takes FOREVER to get to the point and many times there is repitition over the instruction. Sometimes in the same paragraph! A good book that gives information yes, but it could easily have been cut to a third the size."
4,A real good read,I try to read all of Marcia Roses's books and am about through them all. this is really good and traces female healers from early years to today.It is very interesting to read about the struggles of women in the early years who strive to be medical people.
3,Don't buy this TV if you don't have Cable or Satellite,"I bought this TV to replace a 13 year old Sony that served us very well with rabbit ears (antenna). After talking with Sony and a local repair agy re: terrible reception, I was informed that the new TV's are made to receive signals from Cable or Satellite and that no indoor antenna regardless of price, will work satisfactorily."
4,A new perspective of the Civil War and the men who fought it,"The fact-based story of a real family and the son who joined the Union army. The title could have been ""The Making of a Man"" as the title character matured into a strong, honest and courageous young man, independent of his experiences in the war. Fortunately, the author presents the authentic diary of the soldier, revealing fresh insight into his day-by-day life. Days of continuous drills and dress parades between days of combat. The diary also reveals the soldier's surprising knowledge of the progress of the war, even in distant places. Well worth reading."
5,Essential historical recordings of classic juju music!,"""~In response to the reviewer who gave this truely""~ of the newer juju music. If you""~ was really good.A message to Rounder Records: Where is Volume 2 of Juju Roots? Another cd of this early juju music"
5,Books From the ThriftStore,"I have purchased from Amazon several times and have always been pleased with the purchases. Most of them have been used books and have been as described. Good sellers, Good way to go!"
1,Blame Whoopi,"This movie is as bad as everyone says. Boy, I wouldn't want this on my resume, but obviously Whoopi didn't care.That said, I disagree with people who say, ""It's so bad it's good."" If that is true, you should be giving it one star. People who want bad movies are looking for one-star films.And people who think ""poor Whoopi"" should remember 1) She cashed the check, 2) She lives in a mansion, and 3) Stars are associated with the properties they are in, and that's part of the arrangement she knew about and has profited from, so it is fair to hold her accountable for junk like this. In doing this movie she was ripping off moviegoers, even if she didn't think so. This is a comment on soft-hearted reviewers, not the movie.Still, I got my money's worth in renting a wretched piece of Hollywood excrement on purpose to laugh at it."
4,"Oh, what could have been!","I remember seeing this movie in VHS bins at the grocery store, back when it came out, and wondered why I'd never heard of it. I didn't actually watch it until much more recently, though.It's relatively enjoyable to watch if your expectations are not too high-- mostly because the movie can't seem to decide what it is. It can't make up its mind if it's aimed at kids (which it seems marketed to?) or to adults (The themes are pretty mature and dark). The dinosaur characters' costumes and sets are really well done, and it's easy to see how this movie could be the most expensive straight-to-video film ever. I would have loved to have seen how it would have come out if it had been handled as a primarily more mature science fiction movie, in the same vein as the Anonymous Rex novels. I enjoyed Whoopi's performance, especially given what she was working with."
4,Great intro to various artists,"I was familiar with a couple of the artists on these cd's and I was delighted to hear new artists. This compilation made me buy more from ""Sounds from the Ground"" which have proved to be great albums. If youre looking for a sample collection to expand your musical collection, this is a good start."
5,A Classic,"This is required reading if you are doing enterprise development. Even for it's age, POEAA is still THE foundation of the patterns that will be used daily. Some of the material, particularly the object-relational mapping patterns, will be a little to low-level to actually be practically useful (considering the existing frameworks available today) - but still it provides a good background on how this stuff actually works. That is - you probably won't need to implement your own Unit Of Work, but it's still essential that you understand the motivations of the pattern and the problems it solves."
3,A dissenting comment,"I'm a little surprised by the number of rave reviews about this book. The book is ok, but there are some annoying problems that let it down. For starters, the lack of decent proofreading before going to print &#65533; it&#65533;s an expensive reference book and I would expect better quality. Secondly the colloquial vernacular only impedes, not complements the reading. Thirdly, the patterns seemed fewer than I expected and covering only elementary issues. I suppose the audience is primarily for enterprise architecture novices."
4,Good CD overall and a blast to listen to,"THis CD is a great addition to your collection should you have a need for background music during study time, Sunday school or just quiet time around the home. Though these puposes are perfect for their intention, my only wish is that this CD could also be purchased with a split track to remove the vocals from the CD. My primary goal was to use this with my children's choirl giving them up beat, modern worship sound tracks for them to sing too...this CD falls a bit short on that end; otherwise a great product."
5,Rare Glimpse at the Wealthy,Real information on millionaires is hard to come by. Trippon presents a practical approach to accumulating serious wealth. This is the best financial planning book in print today.
1,"Too sweet, and just plain disgusting. DON'T PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","These are too sweet, and the filling will give your teeth Hell. Over-sweetened and it tasted very, VERY processed!Don't say I didn't warn ya!!1 stars"
2,Not very accurate to the Biblical account,"This production was not as true to the Biblical account as I anticipated from reading earlier reviews. The liberties that were taken, presented Moses in a near fanatical light or with thinking that was riddled by doubt & sometimes even outbursts of anger over his internal struggle to respond to God's direction. Neither depiction supports the deeply loyal and humble Moses of the Hebrew scriptures. For me, there were too many Hollywood inspired embellishments in an attempt to bring more drama to an account that needs no drama added. It's only my view, but...I was not very impressed."
2,Not What I Expected,"The Ten Commandants was better. The acting and script didn't match for me, and just because I didn't like it doesn't mean I won't recommend it."
2,Pieces don't hold together,"I got this puzzle hoping to get some education play time with my kids - 3 and 8 year old. While the idea of this puzzle is wonderfull, the product itself not that much. The puzzle pieces look pretty durable but a big issue for us - they don't interlock together like regular puzzles. Instead, you just put them close. Manufacturer probably believed a kid would never bump into a puzzle or wiggle around. We pretty much end up always straightening up the pieces over and over and it's not much fun after all. But I do love the idea of learning about United States this way."
5,Wonderful Christmas CD. A must have!,"I bought this CD when it was first released and this year when the holidays rolled around again, I couldn't wait to play the CD while baking, wrapping gifts and such. It has become one of my most played holiday CDs. It has great songs that are wonderfully done. I love Santa Train...it's a great festive song and it is a kid pleaser! Especially for little boys that love trains like my son does. And it has a nostalgia feeling that reminds the adults what it was like to be so excited about getting to see Santa Claus. Star of Bethlehem and Silver Bells are beautifully done. The background vocals are outstanding on all the songs. And I really enjoy Carol of the Bells by the Nashville Mandolin Ensemble. Since I live in TN...I have been lucky enough to hear them play in person and they are a very talented group of musicians.I highly recommend this CD to your holiday music collection. Even if you don't regularly listen to country or bluegrass music."
1,Terrible reading,"You can understand the basic principles of this book, but that's about it. The in-depth explanation makes you want to learn about something else."
1,recieved,recieved in a timely fashion. dvd would not play on any of 3 players that we had.i threw it away because it wasn`t worth my time to return.
4,Great everyday knee highs,"I've had a hard time finding everyday warm knee highs to wear with both dress pants and jeans in the winter and, so far, these are great. They are not too small nor too tight. I hope they are long lasting as well...time will tell. I am rating these 4 stars, as the wool-blend knee highs (same manufacturer) are a bit longer and thicker and warmer (although these were much cheaper)."
1,if your a child these are great,"My 2 year old niece fits in the leg width, however if you do not have chicken legs do not buy these, not even my arms fit in them. Like I said made for a child or chicken legs."
1,Never really held my interest for long.,"I expected this book to be a mystery/suspense/romance story all in one. In a way, I suppose it was, allthough there was very little suspense or mystery. Juliet, the main character, goes through extremely unrealistic character changes. The ending was a complete let down. The origins of ""Luke"" were never REALLY explained. Why was he brought back? How? And I was hoping for a happier ending as well. I like Marilyn's work on ""Last on Earth"" and ""Replica,"" but I was really dissapointed by this one."
3,Good show with a few problems (3 1/2 stars),"Eli Stone is a good show, but not quite a great one, because it's derailed a bit by the segments that don't involve Eli. The two cocky young male associates at the law firm rub me the wrong way, and their cases just seem like filler. The athlete accused of murder by baseball, the case to reunite gay chimps...that kind of Ally McBeal nonsense just doesn't measure up to the story of Eli and his spiritual guidance towards greatness. I like the musical numbers, the fantasy sequences, the puzzle pieces that come together as Eli figures out how to help someone every week. I'll definitely watch the second season, but I hope the writers have figured out that some of the material works, and some of it doesn't."
5,Love It!,"I love this show. Its too bad its been cancelled at the end of this second season. Its good that I will be able to follow up season 1 with season 2 on DVD. Its full of alot of entertainment, singing, dancing, and drama. I will really miss Eli Stone."
2,"Spend the money for ""Good Hair""","I read both of Ms.Bonner's books. However, her second book, ""Plaited Glory"" was a disappointment. It offered little detail on styling and was basically a re-hash of her first book which was excellent! Buy it and Pamela Ferrell's ""Let's Talk Hair"" instead"
4,Great! Was worth the wait.,"Like ""Good Hair"" before it, this book hit the nail on the head (excuse the pun). I've been waiting for sometime for a book on Afro-natural hair to hit the stands and here it is. My only disappointment (if I may use such a strong word) is that specific products were not suggested, as procuring products that care for and maintain the kinkiness of Afro-natural are hard to come by. It seems to me that because the demand is not as great, the commercial entities, even the ones that proclaim themselves to be 'Black' don't spend much research time or money on developing said products. So it is left to those of us in the 'struggle' to help each other by passing on the information as we go through our experience.Thanks a lot Ms. Bonner, I'm a happier nappy-headed-double-twisted-girl since I received my ""Braided Glory.."" in the mail and thanks Amazon for coming through.PS. I live in the Caribbean."
5,Fantastic saxmen complementing one of the greats of bass,"A fantastic album, mainly ballads & midtempo swing tunes, with 2 uptempo bop tunes thrown in to spice things up a bit. All of the saxophonists shine, especially Joe Lovano on ""How High the Moon"" & ""Easy Living,"" Ralph Moore on ""Crazeology,"" Jesse Davis on ""Moose the Mooch,"" Joshua Redman on ""Just You, Just Me,"" and Benny Carter on ""Fly Me to the Moon."" Benny Green is phenomenal throughout, supporting each sax players unique style in just the right way."
5,Frighteningly Enlightening,"I was first introduced to BARNGA by playing the game at a diversity conference held in the Bay Area, CA. I was surprised at how ruthless and unforgiving I was to the people who entered my little community. I made them play my way and never took the time to understand their point of view or the rules that they knew. I am a student, 18 years old and i wish this concept had been introduced to me earlier. I didn't think that I had any prejudices but I do and BARNGA made me realize them."
1,what?!?!,I have to admit I was annoyed from the beginning and it only got worse. The only reason it didn't get shut off beacause other family was watching. The previews on TV were the only cute/funy parts of this movie.Don't waste your money.
3,Charming but lacking spice and drama,"This is basically a TV movie (Hallmark type) that made its way to the big screen because of the cast. Indeed the acting is very good and the dog is cute. But the script is very bland. These is little drama and too many years are covered for a two hour movie. Unless you really love dog movies, I would pass on this one."
3,Marley & Me,I watched this with my wife. We both agreed that the first 1/2 hour was funny but after that the FEATURE lost it's pizzazz! My rating of 3 stars was based on the first part of the movie being excellent and the second part just being so...so... This in one that should be RENTED BEFORE any PURCHASE!
2,Wish I'd read these reviews before buying it for the grandkids,"As some others have said, this is NOT a movie for families - at least, not for kids under 13. Maybe I have higher standards than most, but I don't think words like ""b@stard"" and ""ass-kissing"" are meant for young ears. Why do they need to hear these things in a movie that's marketed as a ""family movie""?I'm extremely disappointed in the movie. Fortunately, my daughter came to pick up the grandkids about half-way through the movie, so they weren't subjected to any other negative stuff. Yes, I *should* have just turned it off, but I kept hoping it would get better.If you're looking for a funny *family* movie for kids under 13, THIS ISN'T IT! This is typical Hollywood trying to corrupt young minds using a cute puppy and his antics as a ruse."
1,"Inappropriate ""Family"" Movie","I was really excited to watch this movie with my kids, but I ended up turning it off and throwing it in the trash. There was a scene where Jennifer Anniston took off her top (you could only see her from the back, but still...) and there was language throughout the movie that I don't want my children to hear. It was extremely disappointing. If that stuff had been taken out, it would have been a cute movie."
5,Marvelous!,"This movie is not just the ""bad dog destroys things"" stereotype (e.g. Beethoven, Turner & Hooch). The dog is actually a sideshow to the main theme of the film--how is family is formed. We all laughed until our sides hurt, then cried at the end. Then we watched it again and it was even better. Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a no-nonsense dog trainer."
1,Not a family movie in my opinion,Seriously this movie was a bit much for my 7 and 3 year olds...older kids perhaps but not appropriately rated at all! We didn't even get half way before cutting it off and opting for movie we'd already seen 100 times
3,Fairly good movie,"This movie was enjoyable enough, but reminds me of why I don't have a dog of my own. The trials the characters go through have been critiqued by other reviewers as either highly heartwarming or bordering on abuse. I find the movie to be mildly entertaining. The problems I have with the movie are different from the abuse camp, however. The patience that is had with Marley's behavior is something I would not have. There were many instances where I found myself saying that I would have given up the dog. As a movie, it was okay. My 9 year old daughter had read the book, and highly enjoyed the movie, so we had differing views of it. I don't think I will be reading the book for comparison."
3,Not so great,"I ordered this online after missing a black friday sale at Wal-Mart. I was expecting a children's movie that I could watch with my 7-year old brother. I expected something similar to the book. This is, however, not what I got. There were many sexual scenes that made me feel uncomfortable. The movie also, did not focus enough on Marley. I did like the ending, thought it gave enough emotion into it. Especially loved that it made my brother cry. After having seen it once, I am still debating whether to get rid of it or to still keep it. I guess I don't have much reason for either, but I just don't know what to do... Anyway, that's not the point I am trying to make here. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone not ready for such content. I got lucky my brother didn't start to ask questions. Just keep this in mind if you are considering ordering this movie."
2,"Sorry, this was not a good film","As the owner of a treasured yellow labrador I am constantly asked by people if I have read ""Marley and Me"". I always say ""No, I heard it is kind of sad"". Yellow Labs are special dogs, they are loving and intelligent. I am pretty sure the adult Marley in the movie was not a purebred lab, he had a brown topcoat and was lacking the classic blocky head of the breed. I am thinking a real yellow lab would not act like that. Enough about dogs. This movie was dumb, and the star was not the dog, they were Jennifer Aniston's breasts and man was it ever cold on the set.I viewed the cut scenes and they cut out the only scene that might have made you like the dog, along with scenes that developed the characters. FAIL."
3,"Decent movie, irresponsible ad campaign","I recently saw an online ad for this movie which proclaimed it ""the funniest family comedy"" or something like that.This movie is neither family centric nor is it a comedy. There are moments of levity, but mostly it's about a young couple struggling to find their way in the world, with the dog as the glue that holds the story together.It's not good for kids, unless you want to see kids LOSE it crying."
2,If you loved the book you may not like the movie,I was not impressed with the movie. I loved the book and I thought the movie did not do it justice.
1,A cliche-ridden bore,"I guess this is supposed to be a romantic comedy following a suburbanite couple and their endlessly destructive dog Marlee (its destructiveness is supposed to be funny!). But the comedy seems totally cliche-ridden and sentimental, and a waste of time. Give me a good Lassie movie instead anytime."
2,marley and me,"I was terribly disappointed in this movie. Definitely not PG, not suitable for my granddaughter 5 years and I to watch together. She loves dogs but sold it at my garage sale to get it out of my house. A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!should have asked for my money back..."
4,Earth Knack: Stone Age Skills for the 21st Century is NOT a how to book,this book is not all that great. it will not teach you to live in the woods as a primitive. but it would be good to look at and see if this is the kind of thing you like . but thats about it it may be good for kids. the best book on this subject is( primitive wilderness living & survival skill )john and geri mcpherson there great also primitive technology a book of earth skills one and 2
3,I'm disappointed :(,"I am a huge TKK fan, but I must say I wasn't overly impressed with this album, one of the best attributes of TKK is their unusual sound, and I found this album to be rather mediocre. if you are big into techno stuff buy it, but if you want more of the good ol' TKK we all know and love I say pop in confessions of a knife, Hit and run holiday, or 13 above the night and enjoy."
2,Save your money; read Ubuntu's web site instead,"The book is very basic. If you like hardcopies yet don't wish to print pages from Ubuntu's site then perhaps you'll be satisfied. The chapters on Ubuntu's founding are well-written and honoring to their contribution to the computing world. But, as with setup details and troubleshooting help, all can be found on the site."
3,Lacks Detail,"This book was a good introduction to Ubuntu, but didn't offer much beyond a 30,000 ft view. It seemed that as soon as a concept was introduced in a chapter the chapter was over. I would recommend this book if you have absolutely zero experience with the Linux OS, but for anyone with even a minimal amount of experience should keep looking."
2,Worked but didn't,"I was needing a kickstand for my Bike, but there wasn't enough room by the crank to mount one. So, I decided to give this one a try. It did fit the frame, but the way it's made the kickstand stuck out to far and I would hit it with my heel every time my foot came around.So I had to return it and keep looking. The plus for this kickstand is that it's lightweight and easy to mount. Just the fit is questionable."
4,Made it Fit,"As previous reviewers stated, the kickstand didn't come with instructions as to how to mount it. Also, my bike is an aluminum frame type with thicker struts. I had to modify the attachment frame a little (drilled and tapped a hole about 1 inch higher to get it to clamp on the frame member. The stand is a good deal better than the crankset mounted stands. Its completely out of the way and does look like a police bike stand."
3,whooizit scared the crap out of my kid,"So - this toy is supposed to be totally stimulating, but it actually just scared my baby girl when I took it out of the Amazon box. It's kind of on the garish side, not like the softer, cuter Lamaze toys (particularly the puppy)."
3,not too into this toy,"I thought this toy was really cute and bought it for my 7 month old who loves soft toys like this. Unfortunately he hasn't taken to it at all. He likes the squeaky nose, but that's it. Oh well. It's cute, though."
4,Not big enough,"This is a nice heavyweight cover, but in the photo it looked as if it would cover my table (not very long) and the six chairs around it. Well, it didn't, thereby reinforcing the need to measure before you buy :) But my husband made it work out okay. The price is cheap considering what else is out there. Just don't expect it to cover your whole ensemble."
5,Good food and good sense,"Jacques Pepin never fails me, but this book makes me feel somehow more closely connected to him than his other work. I suppose the philosophy of this book feels very true to his roots--seasonal cooking using good technique with a respect for the economics of a home cook, the way his mother probably cooked. I think America may finally be ready for this book--as more and more chefs tout seasonal ingredients, not just because they're cheaper but because they're BETTER, the American home cook may finally adopt what has been common sense for the French for centuries. It was common sense for Americans, too, until the entire processed food plague devastated our connection to nature and our food supply. Well, we're finally healing from that, and this book can be our salve. I agree that not all of the recipes are ""cheap,"" but they do stretch good, high quality ingredients far, so they do tend to be cheaper per plate."
5,My favorite dictionary,"I have used this dictionary for years. It has accompanied me through readings and translations of many Chinese books, and I actually have a warm, affectionate feeling for it.What I love the most about it is that it includes pinyin, zhuyin fuhao, and gwoyeu romatzyh (my personal favorite romanization system). It also groups characters by radical, and has several excellent index options for finding the character you seek (radical group, number of strokes, etc.).One note: take a day and learn the zhuyin fuhao system of representing mandarin sounds. That 5 to 8 hours of effort will reward you many times over. It is an efficient and widespread method of representing Chinese. Learning it opens up a world of literature to you."
1,Don't Go There,"If you are a big fan of all the previous Dangerous Toys albums and are expecting more of the same on this album, don't buy it. If you do, you will find out that album's title is not just a clever parody of Prince. It is not at all what I expected and I was let down track after track. Not worth the money even if you find it used, which is where my copy ended up. Cheer up though, you can always put in any one of the first 3 albums and relive great rock n roll!"
1,Are your kidding?!!,"You guys that gave this thing 4 or 5 stars have got to be kidding. I've always maintained that music appreciation is all subjective, but in this case you've got those first two albums to directly compare to, and this is not ""progress"" or anything else that may be considered as the artist taking a ""new direction"". This is just ""industrial"" crap. Trent Reznor does OK with this kind of stuff, but Dangerous Toys has not.For a band that had some of the best elements of AC/DC together with southern rock at its finest, this is an enormous let-down."
1,May not work,"I bought a Stone Plus 2 GB after trying two different iPod Shuffles that never worked.I had a bit more success with the Stone Plus since I actually heard music come from it and my PC (using XP) recognized it. Everything was fine until it went dead while I was putting music on it. Now it does not even turn on, after hours of charging.I read another case where someone reccomeneds not syncing the date/time wtih your PC. I did this so, maybe that was my problem.Anyway, this is going back to Target and I will try another brand of mp3 player.Prior to the shuffles and the stone plus I have owned 4 mp3 players going back to the Rios. Never had these problems before."
3,Limitations for use in Olympus Stylus 410,"I called Olympus to inquire about use of a 1 GB xD card in my Stylus 410 and was informed that the 512 MB card was the maximun my camera could accept. So I bought the H-512 xD card, only to find out after it arrived and after calling Olympus again that the special features of the card do not function in my Stylus 410 (however, I haven't verified this by testing it myself). The card seems to store pictures and transfer them to my computer okay. Bottom line: no need to buy the more expensive H-512 card for your Stylus 410 when the standard one will do."
5,Very inexpensive xD-Picture Card,"When ever I say this item is as cheap as it gets, one day later I see it elsewhere, cheaper.In this case I don't care if its cheaper (although I doubt it). These cards provide an excellent opportunity to use my three cameras that take this card. Don't be confused when you see that a 1G will not work on your camera. I have found it excellent to take a lot of photos and then switch cameras already loaded.One final thought, this purchase was for three (3), never thought I'd see 3 for less than one a year or so again!"
1,Too Many Errors (Could be great,This book is just what I was looking for to review my Electronic Maths which I did quite a number years ago. Going through the book I picked up error after error. This is a book that for me is a must to have as a refference. I'm looking at various text books for my Kindle. But the errors are very off putting. I am returning my copy but would buy it again if corrections were made. I do hope the Author reviews and fixes up the problems because its idea and layout are great.
3,WARNING: THIS IS TINY,"I bought this to take my adult cat to and from the vet, etc. This carrier is TINY - he has to lie down in it.MAKE SURE you check the dimensions before purchasing. This carrier is for a chihuahua!Also, this snaps in a way that doesn't feel really secure. I was worried it was going to come apart while I was carrying my cat and she would run away at the pet store.The whole purchase was generally disappointing. Had I seen it first hand I would not have purchased it."
1,Cute but that's it...,"Purchased this for my tiny (2 lb) puppy. The small kennel is rated for up to 10 lbs but I highly doubt it would hold 10 lbs in weight let alone the size of a 10 lb dog. Thin plastic, small door entry, and overall felt flimsy. I would not feel safe putting my puppy in this kennel and then carrying it, even at her current 2 lb. weight. I gave it 1 star only because it is a cute pink color."
3,Cheaply Made,"The carrier's clips are not actually attached to either side, so they can go missing. Two out of seven of mine have fallen off. I've only used it maybe 3 or 4 times, but I will be throwing this away soon because I don't feel secure putting a cat inside and carrying it with so many clips missing."
3,AFFORDABLE BUY,"IT WAS OK FOR THE PRICE I PAID. BUT THE SHIPPING AND HANDELING IS WHAT MADE IT COST TOO MUCH FOR THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT. THE PLASTIC WAS THIN, NOT AT ALL LIKE I THOUGHT. NOT HEAVY PLASTIC AT ALL. THIS WAS A MEDIUM SIZE BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A SMALL. THE PRICE SHOULD BE MUCH CHEAPER FOR WHAT YOU GET."
5,Petmate Kennel Cab,"This cab is nice, we took Puddie to the vet and she gave us no trouble at all.Though Puddie did make some angry noises when the Vet gave shots.Works great no problems that I can see.I bought 2 and I'm very happy with them."
1,Don't waste your money like I did!,"I gave this kennel one star only so I could post this review. This kennel is a piece of cheap plastic junk. I wasted $30+ on the medium one, and used it to pick up my new 7-lb. dog from the airport. The second I lifted the kennel from the floor with my dog inside, the latches gave way. My dog crashed to the floor, got up (thank goodness she was okay), and started running through the pre- holiday airport crowd. I managed to catch her and put the kennel back together, but I did not put her back in it. The empty kennel fell apart once again while I was carrying it out of the airport. It is now waiting for the garbage man to haul it away tomorrow."
1,A forced read,"I haven't read many of Connie Mason's books and if Lord of the Night is anything to go by I won't be reading anymore. I forced myself to read through the whole just to see how bad it would get - I wasn't disappointed. The storyline is interesting enough although a little predictable. I found Aleta SOmerset to be the most annoying romantic heroine I've come across in a long time. She comes across as spoilt, selfish, immature and incredibly feeble. Although she was described as being such in the beginning, her character just didn't develop at all. Jamie was little better - he also came across as selfish and to be honest not too bright. The ending was very rushed and tame. IF you don't want tp waste your money as I did then don't but his book"
5,A Must Have,"I was impressed that this book helps and leads you through the ""Maze"". An excellent reference book to add motivation and make you think about what you are doing and where you wish to go.This would make a great stocking stuffer!!!"
3,Mildly disappointed,"I wasn't very familiar with some of the artists, but thought I would enjoy it more than I did. The ones that I didn't know, did disappoint me. Didn't feel it was worth paying the money for without knowing all of the artists. Ya live and learn!!"
5,Beautiful,"This mans hands spanned two octaves. What more can I say? Listened to this all season. My fave is ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman"""
3,come back Claude,"The whole Buddha bar concept seems to be getting a little too prolific: cashing-in suspected here.As an owner of ALL the Claude Challe compilations including the unavailable Les Bains Douches I have to express disappointment.It's an OK compilation but smacks more of middle class dinner party than the inovative earlier Claude Challe and Ravin offerings (Buddha Bar 1, 2 & 3)......If it is to win an award, it should be for the most pretentious sleeve notes around.If you are looking for real leading edge compilation, then go buy the truly excellent ""Arabesque Zoudge 2""."
5,super idea,"better than brushing, you actually get the job done in less time,both you and pet are happy, best to use only outdoors. WONDERFUL!"
2,who the heck is Heck?,"something tells me that robert asprin isn't writing these books any more; for one thing, escrima went from being a no-nonsense chef with a minor accent to a latino/jamaican ""homeboy"" in book 3. the gambolt names are just preposterous, and not meaning to nitpick: is tusk a volton or a voltron? he's referred to as both."
1,Shame on you,"Well, count me among those who say Asprin didn't have anything to do with Phule me Twice, or book three. I suffered through them though, they had a moment or two, but it was few and far between. Not that Heck isn't a decent writer, but he has almost no sense of humor.SummaryBook three, this fool and his money were easily parted.Shame on me.Book four, fooled me twice.Shame on you."
1,Stunk!,"I loved the first two Phule books. #3 was okay. This one? Hated it! Plot holes Chocolate Harry could have driven his ""hawg"" through abound (what happened to the kidnappers? after all the fuss about the casino in the beginning, why nothing more about it?). Characters that were funny and multi-dimensional in previous books became cartoons. (Poor Beeker's character gets ruined completely.) There was no flavor, no structure, no progression, and very, very little of the lighthearted humor that marked the first two books in the series. This one's getting dumped off for the library sale, and I don't think it's worth the fifty cents they'll ask for it. Waste of money - go buy the new Terry Pratchett instead."
3,No AC Adapter!,"Good air mattress, but please note that the pump does not come with an AC Adapter as stated in the product description. The only way to use it is with 4D batteries-- hence the name. I'd prefer a pump that plugs in, but this is a good backup if I've forgotten to charge my other air mattress pump."
4,"Very durable Air Mattress,",Very durable Air Mattress. The pump included was sort of a mickey-mouse device but it will work if you are in the woods with out a ready air supply.
5,great! Every new user should have this book.,"As a new user of Poser, I purchased this book to help me get up to speed. It is very well laid out, and is chock full of info for those of us who are just starting out, or, possibly, who are upgrading from Poser 4 or earlier. Although it does not address the ""artistic"" side of Poser, it will help the artist get to know his or her tools so that one can go on to create exciting artwork. I would heartily recommend this book!"
3,This is not a good guide for learning LaTeX,"This is a compilation of many concisely written topics. I have not enjoyed the writing much, and have found examples more clearly written on many web sites."
1,useless as reference,"This book is pretty much useless as a reference. I bought this book as a reference for my next big document (I'm using LaTeX for some 8 years). Unfortunately I found that the index in this book is virtually useless. Yes, it does refer you to pages in the text that contain the word you are looking for, but that's as far as it goes.""Explanations"" that I did find are generally anything but intuitive, often enough sections never truly deal with what the headline suggests.One star for the examples, that I use as a guide. But generally this book keeps the wood of my shelf from fading."
5,The Best Introduction,"Of all the publications I've looked at for the newcomerendeavoring to get seriously acquainted with digitalphotography, this one book is by far the best!"
1,Disappointing!,"I was very disappointed to learn after buying a few of these books that the author doesn't give the purchaser rights to copy the pages!! Basically useless unless I want to go to ""Copyright _ _ _ _!"
2,Bad movie that wastes Bobby Darin in his last screen role,"Bad movie that wastes Bobby Darin in his last, too brief, screen role. He's noticably thin in it as was filmed shortly before he died. I think his role was heavily edited, so in the end there was little of his performance left. Probably 5-10 minutes screen time total.Really no reason to recommend this movie to anyone whether they be a Darin fan or a movie fan."
2,Stopped short,"I bought this book because my one of my favorite authors, Niall Griffiths, wrote one of the short stories in this collection. He's written some really funny/sick sick stories in the past, but this was one worth leaving unpublished.Most of the stories in this book felt like they were 100 page stories cropped to 10. There were also no paradigm shifts in any of the stories that can make them so much fun.The highlight (if it can be called that) was a story about someone setting up an MMA (mixed martial arts) organization in Croatia. The story wasn't spectacular, but it's the first fictional story I've read or heard about that involved MMA."
5,Great Product,"I have been using this for over 2 years now and i have no regrets. I have very curly, thick hair and with just the right amount, my hair looks shiny and healthy and it is also soft. I haven't had split ends since i began using this product. I will never stop using this. Definitely recommend this to others with curly hair, you wont be disappointed."
3,Disappointed,"I have fine hair that recently became overprocessed. It's not like straw, just somewhat dry. After reading several reviews, I purchased this product in attempt to improve the texture of my hair. I'm afraid to say that my hair is no better. I have been using this product once or twice a week for two months without any results."
2,didn't help much,"For some reason this product did not work well on my colored hair. After reading all the reviews , i was quite excited hoping this product would fix my dry n brittle hair. it did seem to work little but not as expected."
4,Good Hair mask but not for overly dry hair,"Overall this is a good hair mask. I have blonde highlights that became very dry with lots of breakage, this conditioner after using it twice in 5 days didn't really make a huge difference. I think I will have to find a deeper conditioner for my hair type. I did use this product on my nieces hair and worked great - she doesn't have chemically treated hair. I will give Neutrogena credit - the hair mask smells great and does work on virgin hair."
2,Get the film soundtrack,"So-so revival, with the exception of Douglas Sill's, who stole the show as Orin, the dentist. The film soundtrack is far superior, the cast is perfect and Ellen Greene will always be the definitive Audrey (woman, not plant)."
4,Very good music,"I really enjoyed the CD and had the chance to meet with Mr.Teplinskiy, I booked his services for my wedding and I am sure it will be a wonderful musical experience."
4,One of the best Classical Collections out in the market!,This CD has already brought me many hours of enjoyment. I recommend this to everyone!
3,OK,"Some strong plot holes... namely:OK Wolverine and Hulk are going crazy beating on each other, when some guys with .... get this tranquilizer darts.... knock them both out and capture them.Think about that... OK then why if Hulk is always running around destroying city blocks, ravaging small towns, beating on the Avengers.. why dont they just grab a tranquilizer gun??? Then just shoot Banner when he's KOd?Ridiculous, if a .50 cal can't penetrate Hulk's skin.. an air-propelled dart would have no chance."
2,"Eh, not bad for what they are","And what they are are basically 45 minutes of watching a moving comic book.I can't say I really preferred one over the other, to be honest, they were both decent ways to kill time while having nothing in particular lined up for afterwards.The only gripe is the animation; I know they're comic book characters and all, but the animation, in regards to the people, was bordering on atrocious; ghastly stuff there.Oh well, I guess I was spoiled by growing up in the golden age of comic book cartoons: the 90's; now THOSE were some choice cartoons right there."
3,still waiting delivery,"product ordered and paid over a month ago and still not arrived. Hence, it's hard to rate the season"
4,More Golden Girls!,"More of the same, which is great comedy!! The one extra, interview with cast and crew, is cool because you get to see what Rue and Betty are like in the present time. Other than that, no extras! You are able to forward the opening song this time without skipping the whole or part of the episode."
5,A Great Thinking Toy,"My daughter just turned 9 and had received a small Ello kit a few months prior in her Easter basket. I didn't really *get* it until she showed me the display at the toy store.I was pleasantly surprised by the price and bought her two sets for her birthday - a people set and the larger Ellopolis...she loves them.What I love is that this isn't a brainless toy associated with a movie, TV show or cartoon character. It requires thought and creativity. I appreciate that the pictures are ""ideas"" and not detailed plans. Legos are great - but how creative is it to buy a kit and build it precisely according to plan?There are small pieces but no more so than Legos. Hayley has a plastic bin that she works out of - larger enough to hold pieces she doesn't want to disassemble and parts she has yet to use."
3,Just OK,"I bought this set for my daughter right after she turned 5 last Christmas. She was excited to open it, but was somewhat overwhelmed by the number of pieces. Daddy took over and built the house, while she built the people. Unfortunately, she thought the people were creepy looking and they fell apart when she tried to play with them, so this toy has been in its box (minus the pieces that rolled away) untouched for about 10 months. I'll probably take it out again soon to see if her interest has grown, but I think I'm more likely to invest the extra money in a Lego Belville set. (My 33 year old husband, however, had a blast with this toy)."
4,The Crowbar,"The chapter about the crowbar made me begin my search for this tool. It made me think of how I wish I had one of these boy-becomes-a-man tools when I was growing up. Now, since somehow I graduated to manhood, I have to find one for my son, that a few hundred acres of land needing a fence. This is a great feel-good-about being a man book. Not crude, and not wimpy. I gave it to several friends. A great Father's Day gift. Besides, the Author's my uncle. Good Job Uncle L. you can pay me later for the review. ;-)"
1,Huge Disappointment,"This book was a huge disappointment. Instead of providing insights that others might use to understand how the culture of a firm can affect its success or failure, this book was mostly a long recitation of excerpts from news stories and other already public information. Did we really need another summary of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?"
4,Very interesting prespective,"I was with Andersen for 8 years up until the fall of the firm. This is the first book I have read about the firm the takes a methodical look at what exactly happened at one of the most prestigous firms in the world. If you are interested in Andersen's rise to power and some insight as to what it was like inside during the fall, then its a must read."
3,not sure,The brace is coming un-done.Getting the brace on is difficultI may have ordered too small.If your anlke measurement falls in-between sizes - go big.
2,No Soul Heaven,"I usually will pick up anything by MAW, but after listening to this mess of a compilation, I was totally unimpressed. There are some good tracks like Kathy Brown's ""Never Again"" and Tracks 11, 17, and 18 on the 2nd disc, but overall I was very dissapointed. The third CD is slapped together with older tracks that have already been on several of their previous albums. I recommend ""London to Ibiza"" by Lil' Louis Vega or ""Masterworks"" is always a good staple of classic MAW. Album just seems to be pushing a hard post-nuyorican sound that is repetitive and not appealing enough to warrant buying the album, IMO."
4,Overview of beautiful sacred art,"This book is a collection of some of the most beautiful sacred art in the world, including many fine pieces from Asia and Africa with which the casual reader will be unfamiliar. This work covers Goddess images from prehistory to modern images of the feminine Divine from posters of Marlene Dietrich to works by many WOMEN artists (I count five from casual perusal of the plates). Dr. Graham's work centers on the *image* of the Goddess as presenting an important method of understanding Divinity separate from cultural influence and religious theology."
3,Ok for what it is,"I was somewhat disappointed because all the pictures are goddesses rendered by MEN. Apparently there aren't many renderings of goddesses by women out there, or more likely, the author didn't think the women artists were legit enough to be included? What is included is fine and you're probably familiar with lots of them."
4,"Good cables, good value, but...","The product description is a bit misleading. There are 3 spools of cable included with 30 ft. per spool - 2 spools of flat cable, 1 spool of oxygen-free. There is not an extra 50 ft. of flat cable.Having said that, I think the kit is an excellent value vor the money. The 2 sets of video cables alone are worth the price of the kit. If you are doing a Home Theater installation, this is the way to go."
1,The description is misleading,This DVD is not teaching Tai Chi Push Hand as advertised. The whole DVD is teaching Wu Style Tai Chi Long Form. Push hand is only demonstrated at the end of this DVD.
2,Look elsewhere for La Mer,"La Mer is one of my favorite pieces; I've heard live performances by the SF Symphony and the LA Phil. The one on this disc is decent, but there's something about either the balance or the recording quality that seems to lose detail compared to other recordings. (This is especially noticeable in the second movement, where the highlights by the percussion section just don't penetrate.) If you're looking for a great recording of La Mer, I'd recommend the Boulez/Cleveland (ASIN B000001GM5)."
3,Overrated,"Overrated only songs 1-14 are good. The other ones sound like they were first takes. The preacher on here is sketchy he says ""God helps those who help themselves."" That is not a Biblical statement."
4,An outstanding practical guide for teachers to work together,"For any teachers who want to improve their effectiveness in teams and decrease frustrations when teams don't work, this is a useful resource. The chapters touch on the real issues that affect schools and keep the adults in schools from working effectively together. In other words, all the unmentioned political and interpersonal foolishness that nobody teaches you about in teacher school are laid right out there, along with suggestions on how to deal effectively with problem situations. A real must-read for teachers who value collaboration.If you want to be a better colleague and develop the skills to deal effectively with other school professionals, this book can help you. If you are a special education teacher frustrated by resistance from general ed teachers, this book can help you. If you want to stop wasting time at team meetings, this book can help you."
2,"Worthless, could be a 10 page guide, not an entire book","Are you serious, there is an entire chapter on ""How to ask questions"" and ""What is a paraeducator""Each chapter could be about five or six sentences long. I wish I was still within my return window, I would send this garbage back. Keeping it great condition so I can sell it back to Amazon.This book may be useful for 19 year old new college students with no life or work experience, but if you have some time in the real world, this is all VERY common sense stuff."
4,Good book,Good book with lots of information that can be used now and in the future depending on your role in education.
2,A Dave Brubeck Christmas,"I love Dave Brubeck's music but this CD didn't do it for me. Sorry Dave, not one of your better works."
4,Nothing New,"I love DB but, this is nothing new. I was expecting Dave to put some Jazz into these pieces, but he places them ""by the rules"", which ANY church organist could have done. Oh well, you can't go wrong with another DB album, but don't expect to be blown away by this one."
4,Very good,"This is not at the top of our Christmas CD list, but a very good option for those inclined to the jazzy-ness of the season."
3,Nice but tight,"It took three orders to find a bra that would fit. While they are nice very much like a very supportive sports bra, the sizing is horribly confusing and hard to judge. Not a bad value for the money. But hard to size correctly"
3,Bravado seamless is better,"I got this bra and the Bravado seamless bra based on recommendations from experienced mama friends. I'm a 34-D, a small C pre pregnancy. I started wearing the seamless bra the last two week pregnancy and fell so in love I never took it off except for the first few days of motherhood. For those days I wore this bra because it's roomier and better for the engorgement phase. mine was really short and I haven't worn it again. Wishing I had kept the box so I could return it for another one of the seamless version. Another downside is the material is cotton and not very soft (compared to the seamless which is very elastic). I also think my boobs look perkier in the seamless."
3,Not for me,"I found that this product offered less support than i wanted during the difficult first weeks of nursing. Even with the correct size, this bra didnt really help with engorged breasts when sleeping on your back. The other Bravado bra (Silk Seamless), which was pricier, did a better job of supporting me while i slept and all throughout the day. This made it a better investment than this bra."
5,"Great Story...Fiction, but factual","Being from Oswego, New York, which is where this fabulous story is set, I could actually see the places and things that the author was talking about in her story. Bat-Ami has written a compelling love story that actually tells about an important place and time in history. This is truly one of the best books I have ever read."
2,"Only set to ""A""","Be aware that the remote is only set to ""A"". If you use another letter in your program it won't work."
5,Great buy!,"My son came home from school with a Blockhead. When I told him I used to have Gumby and Pokey he just HAD to have them, too. I saw this set and surprised him with them. They are just like the ones I used to have! He loves them and plays with them frequently. This was a great buy!"
2,Not Like Mother!,"I bought these as a replacement to the Soothie pacifiers my two-month old received from the hospital, as I wanted something with a smaller shield so her nose wasn't being smushed. I liked the concept of these pacifiers, however these don't seem like mother at all. The nipple is shorter than the Soothie nipple, and my daughter had a hard time getting a ""suck"" established with it. Also, the silicone used for the nipple is not as supple as the Soothie nipple."
5,Extra pool protection,This item was easy for my husband to install and gives us extra pool security on our pool gate for our small grandchildren. The alarm is well loud enough to alert us if ever needed. The key pad is easy to use for pool entry.
4,knight sabers,"bubblegum crisis 2040 is cool, but check out BGC 2032 and bubble gum Crash! the 1990 version is a little more twisted.can't wait for initial D."
2,Never really connected with me,"This story never really connected with me. I couldn't get into it. It was not compelling. The characters development was only fair to average which made the series seem more like a somewhat PG version of ""Power Puff Girls."""
4,What a great book this is!,"True science-fiction, military science-fiction, a Gunny, Wood Elves, orcs, and a demented rabbit - what more could a Ringo fan (or anyone else!) ask for?This is really a very well-written foray into a new universe, with attention to detail and a rollicking sense of humor. I highly recommend it to one and all."
5,Another great John Ringo story,"There will be dragons is another great book by John Ringo. This is his first foray into more of a classical fantasy world from his previous series of Mil-scifi. It is a great amalgam of the Fantasy, Alternate history, and Mil-scifi genres. It has a great combinatio of settings and characters to please the lover of any type of Scifi.Gods (but not), Elves and mere humans (mostly) fight to save humanity, survive the fall of Utopia and more mundane things like learn to work again and be merely human.I recommend this book to anyone who likes scifi. The only bad thing is John isnt writing fast enough..."
4,Maxxair is a good deal,"Not bad for the money! Could be better packaged - no damage, but the cartons were in sad shape. Bought two for the shipping department - works great!"
1,"Boring, devoid of content","I threw it in the garbage halfway through Chapter 8. That's when I realized I had read 288 pages and had barely learned a thing, was staring at yet another incomprehensible diagram, and probably could have learned more from a 20 page white paper. The book spends way to much time describing fairly straightforward concepts. Perhaps I should have kept plugging along. But if the book failed to engage me in the first 300 pages, it was unlikely to in the last 500."
2,"Much too verbose, will confuse someone just getting into SOA","This book has far to much ""Hamburger Helper"" in it. I am a veteran at SOA and wanted a book I could reference. It is long winded. For example, the author goes through 106 pages before he gets to the true definition of SOA on that page 106. This should be in the first 5 pages. The definition is good but why the heck did he have to confuse the novice reader with all that ""contemporary"" and ""Primitive"" SOA discussion. I cut through those pages fast but I bet a novice is going to be really confused reading this book. I would not recommend this to customers as some of the testimonials at the front suggest. I picked up a few ideas here and there. A two star is about right."
5,The best version of Four Seasons,"I bought three other versions of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and disliked them all. I never knew how much more I liked my mom's version, which she always played in the car. It could be just that that was the first version I heard, but this seems the best. Others seem to have unnecessary flourishes and feel overly emotional. That probably relates to the dramatic photos of the violinists on the cover; this recording's not pretentious and it's well balanced between being musically accurate and emotional. The cover art is subtle but has character, like the recording."
5,Dreams of Sedona,"Every time I listen to ""Dreams of Sedona"" I visit segments of my first nature. Living in a highly tense world, it is a gift of peace that this talented musician has managed to extrude from synthesizers. His music transports one rapidly to a blissfull state."
2,Great expectations - DVD set doesn't deliver.,"Miami Vice was the one TV series that I couldn't wait to be delivered on DVD. I expected this series to shine on DVD!When I picked the first season set up, I rushed home, unwrapped it and threw the first DVD in my player. The picture quality was below average and the DVD freezed several times.I later learned through an article in Video Business magazine that the reason for the glitches are the double sided discs using the DVD 18 format. The plants producing these discs are running over capacity and it is a quality control issue. Several studios are acknowledging the problem and switching from DVD 18 to DVD 9 on certain DVD TV titles. These single sided discs have more durability. Warner Brothers recently switched producing the West Wing and Dukes of Hazzard from DVD 18 to DVD 9. Universal Studios had not commented. I'm hoping Universal Studios corrects this problem and reissues Miami Vice on the standard DVD 9 format."
5,The most romantic album of all time,"David Lanz is one of the premier new age artists, and this wonderful album is the pinnacle of his career. His haunting and flowing melodies are the most romantic music I have ever heard and I played this album often while courting my wife. A perfect choice while drinking wine or having a candlelit dinner."
5,A surprisingly good gift.,"I got this stuff as a gift from my sister after she'd heard me complain about shaving one too many times (hey, it's hot in South Texas). It works. My face feels great and it isn't greasy at all. Also, it's unscented so you can wear whatever cologne you want. A little bit goes a long way, so the price isn't as excessive as it seems at first. Apparently, it also reflects some great technology by Clinique, according to the girl behind the counter, but I can't really say because I wasn't in the mood to get a lecture in the cosmetics department. I'm glad it's on Amazon now."
2,Just about ok,"I am afraid I cannot recommend this adaptation. The crucial difficulty is a lack of appreciation of the characters in the three books Gerald Durrell wrote about his family. Instead the family and those around it emerge as caricatures at most, with sketchy reminders to those of us who grew up on these marvellous books. Especially disappointing is the lack of character development of Theo and Gerry. Especially unforgivable is the musical score which is obtrusive and mostly annoying-- at times it actually gets in the way of appreciating the dialog and acting. Watch this from a library, it is not worth owning."
3,A Trailer,"This version of My Family and Other Animals is but a trailer for the far better and longer version starring Hannah Gordon and Brian Blessed. Yes, I know it was produced a long time afterwards but in my opinion, apart from the wonderful Rose Beetle Man it can't compete with the Joe Waters production with its screenplay by the masterly Charles Wood (Charge of the Light Brigade, Help, Iris). Of course the latter version had more time to enjoy the animal life and more time to explore character."
4,Masterpiece Theatre Stories,"I've always found the Masterpiece Theatre presentations to be outstanding.""My Family and Other Animals"" is typical of the above average acting and above average production of most of the other stories in this series (usually found on PBS broadcasts). The material is presented in an intelligent manner that does not ""talk down to"" the viewer. Even when the story-line is light-hearted and humuorous, it maintains integrity of story-telling that does not insult. The story line does not move quickly (as in the 1 or 2 second bites of a typical Hollywood movie)so be prepared to give attention as the story un-folds."
5,Classic McCaffrey,"Killashandra takes a new character, subjects her to overwhelming odds and brings the character thru to being the epitomy of individuality. As Anne did with the HarperHall books, she brings to us a unknown girl, Killashandra Rhee, who has just been flunked out of her school. She has all her life wanted to be a singer. and now because of ""a slight burr"" in her voice, it's all over. In walks your traveling Crystal Singer on vacation, and its Exit Stage Center Killashandra Rhee, off on the adventure of a life time. We follow Killa thru her orientation and training as a Crystal Singer, a very dangerous profession indeed. We meet Lanzecki (sp?) the head guy there who takes a liking to this spunky, determined young woman. Follow Killa's adventures thru all the Crystal Singer books. If you liked the Pern Books, you will love these. Anne, THANK YOU SO MUCH for all the stories that you have given us. You have changed this humble boys' life, that's for sure"
4,Good book,"I really like The Crystal Singer trilogy and the Universe created by Anne McCaffrey. I did read most of her books, and they are all linked one way or another.This book was easy to read. I really like the characters, their personality. I won't say more, otherwise it would be spoilers."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"I bought this phone to get a complete organizer for my busy schedule. I was pleasantly surprised to find a well designed phone. It has alot of great features and some very standard features that are good enough for me. Im not the most tech saavy person, but this phone helps me out alot in my day to day.Plus I dont have to carry a phone and pda, now its just the phone.My only problem with the phone is the size....If they made thisphone to be slimmer like the RAZR, I would buy another in a heartbeat. Oh year batteries last for almost 3 days full!!!One one full charge, pretty good if you forget to charge sometimes.But the size of the phone would be my only concern, other than that, this phone is extremely useful in my day to day planning."
3,"Cute, but not a must have...","A cute little book with a nice short story, but as mentioned, just small and really short, therefore not really something you must have. But I guess good for on-the-go. Really ok for the price though."
