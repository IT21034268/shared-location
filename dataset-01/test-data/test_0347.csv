2,Not the original as expected.,"To me, this line- ""Wrist Strap Premium Combo for Nintendo Wii""- means it is designed as the original Wii strap but it is not. As others have mentioned there is no snap lock as on the originals. Had I bothered to blow the pictures up and looked harder I would have seen that but I didn't so my bad. They arrived quickly and the price was right but the merchandise was not what I expected."
3,Get what it shows... minus the second black strap,"Like the title says, you get what it shows, but there is only one black strap... not two. They straps don't have a clasp, just a slider, but that's fine.Main complaint is simply that they show two black straps when the little baggie they come in only has one."
2,We've cpome a long way,"I had eagerly awaited the release of this DVD because this was a very favorite show of mine in the late 60s. It is painfully slow, the acting is tilted, the music cheesy and the lines corny. A great nostalgia trip though"
4,Hard driving music for people bored with rock & roll,"JTQ Creation starts out with wailing police sirens and kicks in with a rousing, rocked-up version of the Starsky & Hutch theme. After a fast beginning, Creation stays in high gear for most of its 43 minutes. This isn't soul music, or funk, but more like a cross between 60's & 70's TV & spy themes and English prog rock like Emerson Lake & Palmer. There isn't much subtlety to this collection, but that's the band's uniqueness. They're using their high testosterone levels in a constructive way: By playing the heck out of their instruments. And believe me, these guys are talented! If you love to rock and are ready to stretch a little, try JTQ."
4,Excelent Find,"This book is available at my local giant-bookstore for 6 dollars more than what Amazon offers it for.The book is very fancy and caught my eye nearly immediately when I walked in the door. As a lover of Egyptology, I immediately sat down and paged through it and knew I had to have it. I didnt buy it there, because I knew it would be cheaper on Amazon, but its definately worth the SRP of 19.99. Very unique and full of fun information for all ages."
5,Egyptology,"I bought this book for myself and i have to say it is absoutely awesome! I stayed up for 2 hourse reading every detail of this exciting ""long-lost"" diary. The games Senet is very fun and the ""papyrus"" looks very real! The cover looks like it is made out of gold and is very cool. I enjoyed this book and reccommend it to everyone.- Sophi :-)"
5,A Great Series,"This is just another great book in a great series of books. If you haven't collected them yet, I recommend it. Dragonology, Egyptology and Wizardology along with now Dragonology Handbook, Egyptology Handbook and HOPEFULLY to come Wizardology Handbook. They are all beautifully done, filled with hiddened surprises and lots of things to do -- an adult treat childstyle."
2,"If you like Stereolab, prepare to be disappointed","I had really looked forward to hearing this because I am a big Stereolab fan. Unfortunately, on this CD, K. Gifford's vocals are rather listless especially when compared to her singing with Stereolab. This, along with the so-so songwriting made this album a big disappointed. Get yourself a copy of Stereolab's ""Mars Audiac Quintent"" or ""Transient Random Noise Bursts With Announcements"" instead."
4,Great,A really wonderful debut. Gifford's rather flat vocals stick way back in the brain as do the rather eclectic arrangements and assortment of sounds. Finally some new music to listen too.
1,What a lousy software!,"Bought it. Tried it. Absolutely hated it. I have purchased and used many packages from CAD to photo manipulation. This is one of the most difficult to use.I had a unique hang up in the software so I called their tech support. No call back. So I searched the website (most user unfriendly). Downloaded and installed a patch. No go. To make a long story short, I had three calls without answer and I am returning the package to the company. The best thing about the software is that they back it up with a money back guarantee for 60 days. If you buy it, you may need it!Poor software. Terrible support. The box has a tag line ""From vision to plan in a weekend."" Not in this lifetime."
2,It Takes More Than Lyrics,"The British music press - which I've been reading for thirty years, on and off - grows increasingly discredited. Their championing of any group with an attitude, irrespective of the group's actual talent, is becoming pathetic - and a disgrace to the memory of the groups they dare invoke in their comparisons. This particular bunch of Northerners, with their sneering vocals and tales of drinking and clubbing, are being compared to Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, and even the Beatles. But even the worst of that trio - Oasis (by far) - occasionally wrote and recorded a tune or two. There isn't a single track on this album that's memorable for anything other than the words. That's not good enough. The Artic Monkey's front man said it best himself: ""Don't believe the hype""."
5,Just great!,I love this group! This album is clean and straightforward. You get all of the rock with none of the BS. It is fresh and contemporary and just plain fun. Buy it now!
4,Can't People Just Enjoy A Good Rock Record?,"Alright, this is a good debut. Though they're no Oasis, they're still a solid band breaking through some ground. Forget the hype and make your own decisions. This band got famous because of MySpace, remember?"
1,"Okay, then you guys are ""Awesome. Talented. Deserving of the Hype""","Man, what a total disappointment - this album is STONE DULL. Once again, just because you think you can play a guitar / drums / bass does NOT mean you have talent. This stuff might work if I heard it played live in a warehouse, but I doubt it. This album is nothing but a paltry Strokes imitation. Even FIOE is better than THIS, and that's saying something. After all the press, I thought I was going to hear something exciting. That wasn't the case. I kept looking at the time remaining on the cd player, sorely waiting for it to end. I don't think I've heard worse singing / lyrics since ""Separation Sunday"" by The Hold Steady - consider the Arctic Monkeys their UK equivalent."
5,I LIKE THE MONKEYS!!!,"This debut from the ARTIC MONKEYS is really good! It's like a more punk the Strokes...All the songs flow well...Nothing new, but rock with some punk attitude, something that most of the bands today just can't make anymore..."
1,Didn't Bon Scott die 26 years ago?,"Anyway, this CD is overrated. Avoid this, and avoid any reviewer who names himself after dead rock stars. They can't be trusted."
3,great new music,"once you get past the first track, you're in for a treat. some of the best new music this year. enjoy."
1,Ew,"This music stinks. They use such profane language in their songs. I mean, can anyone these days just use clean language? Explicit language is just a confirmation that this band has no vocabulary to express their lyrics. I reccommend you to not buy this album, and instead get so real by mandy moore. So baby come to me show me who you are yeah yeah yeah, sweat to me like, sugar to my heart oh baby, im craving for you i'm missing you like candy"""
2,Frigidly fun,"Consistently catchy, conversely clunky polished punk managed to strike at the right time in England and consequentially has been slapped down to earth by less-hyped perspective ever since. Nothing inherently evil here, but little more than smooth garage rock with mediocre bite."
3,Not All That Great,"I've heard the phase ""Saviors of Rock and Roll"" about these guys, so in turn I bought this cd with high hopes. The few songs I had heard a few times on the radio were in fact great. But on a whole that is exactly the number of songs on this cd that are great one or two. The rest I think is pretty unlistenable. So if you want a true review of this maybe listen to a copy of your friends first. Like I said a few real good songs but to my taste a lot of filler as well.>>>---Zen--->"
5,Once you go Blenheim you never go back,"I have been lucky to enjoy Blenheims all my life. In fact I just made a few huge batches of jam with them. Fresh, dried, canned, or jammed. This is the BEST apricot variety out there. Everyone should try them at least once. You will never go back to those HORRIBLE Turkish apricots."
5,Great!,"I love Yoko series because I am from Japan! The book is so cute! The shipping was very fast, too. Thank you!"
5,A surprise present,Great price for an amazing Christmas present that my husband thoroughly enjoys. Shipped quickly and without an incident. Just need a case now.
4,teach yourself mandolin,This book is very helpful and gives step by step information on everything you need to know. Even how to read music.
3,Good for the price,"This mandolin is exactly what I expected. A reasonably priced, but kind of cheaply made beginner's instrument. It is not the best mandolin I have seen but pretty much the only one within a reasonable beginner's price. Not a bad instrument at all."
4,Very nice beginner's instrument,"This mandolin has an overall nice tone and was in great condition when it arrived. The bridge didn't contain notches in the correct spots, so had to do some very minor adjustments to move the strings into the correct spacing. However, it does have an adjustable action via the bridge which I was not expecting. The strings were a little dirty, but that's what a cleaning cloth is for. Overall I'm happy with this purchase!"
3,"Not bad, but I was not expecting much at this price","I first purchased a far east cheapie that was so poorly made that I returned it. This one cost about 50% more but it is much better made. I wanted this as an inexpensive ""beater"" to keep in the car for practice. So it looks a lot better and I have not had any problems with it. But I will say I have not used it very much. My job situation changed and I have less time for such practice. Not being a real musician I cannot say anything about the sound or the usability. It does seem to be well enough made for the price that it should serve a beginner well enough until he knows how serious he willl be with a mandolin."
2,Falls Flat,"I appreciate the good work that Michael Harner has done in the realm of anthropology and shamanic studies, but this drumming CD falls flat. It's not that the drumming is bad, but the recording of it is flat and thin sounding. It contains none of the richness that I am sure is there when it is played live. Luckily there are better drumming CDs out there for people who have a shamanic journey practice. Laura Chandler's ""Sacred Drums for the Shamanic Journey"" is thus far at the top of my list."
3,No More to the Dance,"I bought June Tabor and Maddy Priors' first album together 'Silly Sisters'[ASIN:B0000086FC Silly Sisters]way back in the late '70's and,30 years later, I still dance around the kitchen and sing along to it'srustic tunes and earthy lyrics. So when I saw 'No More to the Dance' for sale, produced over 10 years after 'Silly Sisters',I bought it in the expectation that it would be more of the same. However, I should have paidmore attention to the title!This is a far more sombre and sophisticatedwork. Parts of it recall 'Gaudete' by Steeleye Span (also Maddy Priorsinging), other parts the heavy tragic ballads from June Tabor's solo work. It's relaxing music to listen to in winter next to the fireplace!"
2,it is really small,this was a disappointment. these stickers could be stuck on fingernails with room left over. the pictures repete and are lame
2,Gas Cap,"Never fit tight enough to pass emission testing in Arizona. I would never buy this item again, need better fit than this will offer."
1,Save Your Money,Textbooks and notes from past classes would be far more helpful than this book. The only valuable pieces of information are the section describing the content of the test and the practice test. Both of these are available in the free booklet you can download at the GRE site. (The practice test is exactly the same.)
5,Paper towel holder,"I was looking for an under-cabinet paper towel holder that is sturdy. This product fills the bill. We did have to get shorter screws, though, so that they wouldn't go through the cabinet bottom."
2,I found this book very disappointing.,"This book was recommended as a good Holocaust/WW II book, but I wasn't very interested. The format was hard to follow, and although it had good aspects of WW II when it came to some of the characters, too many facts were jumbled together in a paragraphs of small capacity. It was hard to understand. The main character, 'Katinka', was a young girl that was hard for me, as a young adult, to be on the same level with. I cannot truly say that this is a good book for avid readers of Holocaust/World War II material."
3,A Good Book,Katarna is a jewish girl that lives in a small village. The year is 1942 and the Germans are rounding up all the jews. Katarina's Aunt Lena goes away to another country to see if it's suitable for them to live in. Aunt Lena never returns and Katarina is stuck on a farm with a peasant family. When Katarina returns to her village she finds out that the Germans have lit it a fire. The only person she finds when she returns is her teacher Miss. Sipkova. Katarina is an exciting book and worth buying or reading.
4,Cutest Thing,THis is the cutest thing. Once you pull elmo's right hand his left leg gets smaller. While saying silly phrases. To cute.
2,Broke Quickly,"I bought elmo for my daughter for Christmas and by Jan. 2 he no longer worked. His arms still move but he doesn't talk. I changed the batteries and that did nothing. Elmo was really fun when he worked, now he's just another toy. I am very disappointed and would not recommend buying."
5,Netprobe Media Press Review,"This book is an inspirational and thought-provoking teaching from God's Word. Al Pittman taught this just before he went through a storm in his own life. I thought it was interesting that God gave him this teaching that could bless millions and at the same time prepare him and his family for what they were about to go through. Refreshing and timely, and very well-written."
5,Teriffic Blues music,"BB King: Greatest Hits is a tremendously wonderful Blues CD. It has all the music you could expect. It's too bad my family has only one BB King CD. But now knowing how good BB King is, I'm going to collect more. So if you like BB King, you'll LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this."
3,"So many better B.B. King recordings out there,,,,,,,,","Make no mistake, having this is better than owning no B.B. King at all!! But before you get this CD, you should also consider ""Live at the Regal"", or ""Live at Cook County Jail"", or even ""Blues is King"", each of which are live performances where ""The King of Blues"" really shines doing what he does best...playing the blues. This Greatest hits collection features some inferior pop songs and crossover performances which makes it, IMO, less enjoyable and not as essential as the live recordings."
2,heavy accent,"Although the scale is English speaking,the voice has a very heavy accent. This makes the spoken weight difficult to understand."
1,scale is inaccurate,i bought this scale cause i was to big to read the digits and have the scale in one spot - when i step on the scale performs the correct functions but the weight flexuates in 10 pounds or less every day - i weight myself once everyday cause im on a strict diet -- one day it will give me a number the next i gained up to 10 pounds no way jose -- for the amount of money you spend this manufacturer is taking you to the cleaners -- in no way with 8oo calorie day do i gain 10 pounds it does this alot now thanks to this manufacture im out the money cause i haveto buy a scale and the next one wont be his
1,THIS SCALE IS A RIPOFF,The scale has no volume control and is very hard to hear.The sight dial is a dark grey so the visual is uselessunless you pick up the scale before the numbers disappear.
2,It Didn't Take Long,Picked up my copy of the complete series at Big Lots for $6. They have a zillion of them. Complain about the Bond sets so they will turn up there too.
5,CRASHES!,Ok this Movie is Called EXECUTIVE TARGET but I put for the title CRASHES! cause this is another one of PM Entertainments Action Packed Movies and it has a lot of Car Crashes in it and PM is known for putting stuff like that in there Movies.and dont worry about the Price cause if you want Really Good Stunts Buy this Now it is Awesome as for the Story part of it its Good but this Movie Mainly Focuses on the Crashes and they are Awesome and Out Of Sight.
1,Maytag Gemini,"This range is a disaster. Negative five stars.Ours has been on fire twice, all burners and burner controls have been replaced twice.We are afraid to leave it plugged in because the lower oven will go on by itself and won't shut off unless it is unplugged. The control board and lower oven temperature sensor are bad.Left alone this thing would have burned our house down at least twice.I am done with repairs, this thing is going in the trash where it belongs.This thing is not even a good boat anchor.I will never buy another Maytag and suggest you do the same."
2,FBI P.R.,"Reader beware: this book is told shamelessly from the law enforcement point of view, and therefore lacks credibility. Believe it or not, not all FBI agents are saints and heroes. they are, after all, human -- and like most humans they tend to engage in self-aggrandizement, which the author falls for hook, line and sinker. The only person who could enjoy this book is somebody who knows absolutely nothing about the subject, and will therefore believe anything."
3,Uhm...,"I haven't read the book, but I find it suspious that every review posted so far was outrageously positive, and posted within an 8 day period. In addition, most of them are anonymous. Perhaps the Publisher or Author is trying to boost sales with duplicate reviews. Buyer Beware."
5,Extraordinary information!,"Wright's book points out the profound issues confronting behavioral geneticists during this century. Major genetic breakthroughs in explaing our behavior become easy targets for the opposition since these ideas are outside their accepted ""paradigm."" Where are you, Thomas Kuhn? By marking the existence of monumental social programs being constructed out of the environmentalists' control over behavioral thinking, he reminds us how a little common sense could solve our societal problems. He says that environmentalists look for external ""problem"" issues that allow the continuance of victim mentality. In addition, he brings us to the point where other groundbreaking questions need to be asked and answered. Can we anticipate behavior by an individual's appearance...since the way we look is hereditary?"
1,Disapointing,"The Amazon description indicated the game would play on Macintosh ... it will not. To be fair the vendor did offer to return my money, but the cost was insignificant and I really just wanted the game to run on MacOS X.If there is ANY fault it lies in the Amazon description."
3,Above my Expectations,"Before I got this album, I was skeptical about the lyrical qualities that Knoc-Turn'al possessed, because neither ""Bad Intentions w/Dr. Dre"", nor ""Muzik"" were tracks that shed light on his talent. Now that I heard the album I would not go as far as calling Knoc-Turn'al a master of lyricism, but his flow is decent and the musical production (no surprisingly) is excelent. The guest appearances of great rappers such as snoop, nate, xzibit, warren g etc. help the album a lot and make it worth buying for the fun of it. So this album in itself is definitely worth your time, but Knoc-Turn'al's talent is yet to develop (as I said his flow is decent, Not spectacular or anything more)."
3,"Why Would Anyone Care Whether ""The Outfield"" Was In It?","The Outfield only had one good song - ""Josie's On a Vacation Far Away"" then they vanished back into the Great White North from whence they came. They're about as important as Kajagoogoo, M and The Hooters."
2,Wish they worked,"These were offered at a great price, but unfortunatley they didn't work in our van. All we could hear was static, so we had to return them."
2,Broken by car wash,This product broken when I went through the car wash. The plastic that was attached to the hood actually broke so it is now a piece of garbage. Very disappointed in this product.
5,Incredibly helpful as I go about raising my 11&13 yr. olds,This book offers practical tips on raising the 10-13 year old. Goldstein's approach is down to earth and respectful towards children. Quick reading!
1,Didn't work in my T30-2366,"Actually, I was able to charge it to 50% the first night, but once I used up that charge I was unable to get it to charge again. I was unable to find support information at IBM.com, HiCapacaty.com, Amazon.com, or the Taiwanese manufacturer. I tried the following without success:- Plugged and unplugged power adapter and battery- Update battery driver from Device Manager- Deleted battery driver from Device Manager and rebooted- Upgraded IBM Embedded Controller Program- Upgraded BIOSI am using Windows XP.Maybe the one I got was a dud, or maybe I didn't do something I needed to. For whatever reason it didn't charge a second time so I am returning it. I might pay the extra $10 or $20 to get the official IBM replacement part instead (also available from Amazon)."
4,very good,if you like Sarah's voice you will enjoy this one. it's a much more calm and peaceful album than the ones she made with K's Choise and the quiet songs make you realy appreciate her beautiful voice
4,A Taste of Temptation,"To humor her aunt, Olivia Banning investigates Andrew Terwillger's home to see if he is housing the ghost of her aunt's lost love. When he catches her in his bedroom, a chain of events is set in motion that takes the last of the great rakes to the altar. He had never intended to wed, but now, he does, and is unwillingly captivated by his wife. For her part, Olivia is equally unwilling, but then, something begins to happen.**** This sweet novel has a charm to it that will win over historical fans who may not particularly like Regencies, for this could be termed a long Regency. Though the hero and heroine's story is the main thing, the side story about the possible ghost adds a great deal of fun as well. ****Amanda Killgore"
3,problems,this picture shows the right product however I have reicved uncomplet one - the rubber guard were missed!!! Amazon gave me 20% off.
3,The Audio CD's outside cover was damaged,When I got the All of the above CD the outside cover was damaged. I don't know why it happened. I have brought Hillsong CD's before and this has never happened before.
4,And I'm not much of a gospel fan...,"But THIS is awesome. You don't have to be a gospel fan to appreciate the tight harmonies these guys are capable of. If you have a slight appreciation for old time or bluegrass, there's a 99% chance you're going to like this album."
3,Average but not bad,"Overall this book fell a bit short of my expectations.The pictures are nice because it puts a face to the description, but even for a book covering an entire country it felt a little anemic.Even large cities like Roma, Florence, etc. covered only major items, not even a few unique/unusual suggestions.This book is alright as a decent start and it's certainly visually appealing but I find other books to be more thorough & useful. Forget the pictures and just get a better book (Frommers, Lets Go, Cadogan, & Unofficial Guides are all solid) and add in a little internet research to see what the lesser known areas look like."
4,"true, 4 stars is enough but very strong 4 ones","I join in my pre-commentator. Where will we end if we award 5 stars that easily...:-)I know Galactic and have to agree this one here is at least one notch cooler. There has been a time where I listened to Galactic quite a bit, but somehow I grew out of it. The best music is the one you never grow out of. As soon as I can get this one here, let' s see what will happen."
5,The Black Cottage,The Black Cottage kept my interest from the beginning page until the final sentence. Even though I am not familiar with medical terms it was easily understood. I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I am a John Grisham fan and this book rates up there with many of his novels. Five stars go to the Black Cottage.
1,This is a piece of junk.,I purchased this about 3 weeks ago. I was skeptical when I took it out of the packaging. The product looked shabbily made. I used it for 2 days before it stopped working the first time. I replaced the batteries and tried it again. After about 1 week the rope kept resetting itself every 80 or so jumps. After about 2 weeks it quit working altogether. My last digital rope was from Champion and lasted 4 years. However they are not made anymore. I will never buy anything from this manufacturer again. The products are horrible.
4,It works,"This product is not perfect. At times it is difficult for me to tell what the ""talking jumprope"" is telling me. It took a time or two before the plastic (rubber?) rope to become pliable, but now that I have the correct length and it has softened some, it works fine. It is worth what I paid for it and it does what it is supposed to do."
1,Product not usable.,The iPod battery accessory was a cheap knock off. It was poorly constructed and was warped on arrival making battery installation difficult. The batteries were corroded and were leaking acid into the package. Overall the product was not usable.
2,Very poor quality product,"Three days after I received the two lamps I bought, and with a minimal use of the switches, both lamps are no longer working. The switches are already broken. I wouldn't have bought these items had I known how poor the quality of the lamp and particularly the switch were."
2,Not worth it for me,I bought the hippo. Cute...but it doesn't stay on the tub spout. My son immediately pulled it off and wants to play with it. So now its just a tub toy.
4,"Not perfect, but still works","I imagine that since there are a lot of different shaped spouts out there that not every product will work for every person. We have a brand new faucet and although this doesn't fit perfectly, it does work pretty good. It slips down the spout slightly but it isn't easy to get all the way off. My 18 month old son doesn't even try to take it off anymore. It doesn't stay on all the way but the important thing is that it still protects the end of the spout...which came into use when my son bumped his head pretty hard on the spout when the hippo was on and didn't even act like he was hurt."
4,Hippo Faucet Cover for the Bath Tub,"We bought this for my daugher who insists on taking a bath in a tub of water in the kitchen. Once we turned this on and I played with it, she begged to get her hands wet too. After about 20 minutes of play, she wanted to get in and get her feet wet too! Bath times are a lot easier now. Thank you Kel-Gar!My only complaint is that the bubbles do not dispense very well. I think I might need to make the drip hole a little bigger so it works."
2,Coy and claustrophoba-inducing,"Based on the jacket blurb, I was hoping this would be a fun, literate romantic comedy. After the first two chapters, however, I found myself wishing Helen had a richer inner life, since Schine spends almost all her time detailing Helen's thoughts and feelings. Helen is too complacent and sold on her own charm and flirtatiousness to be interesting as a character we're supposed to identify with wholeheartedly. Jane Austen or Barbara Pym would know how to use irony to give us a larger perspective on Helen, but Schine really seems to expect us to fall in love with Helen. The references to books and reading (Helen owns a bookshop) end up feeling dropped in, since Helen never seems convincing as a reader and lover of books. The cutesy quality of the plot and some of the language, along with Helen's self-obsession, end up giving the novel a claustrophobic feeling."
1,Don't bother reading this book!!!!,"When I first started seeing the hype for this book,I thought it would be good. But, it isn't. I was extremely dissapointed. It's so boring and dull that I didn't even bother finishing it. If I could, I'd give this book a zero. I got myself 3/4 read, but was so digusted by the story and characters I couldn't finish. Helen is a self-absorbed, sef-centered women. Is Johnny 20 or 10? I couldn't tell. If I were you, don't read it. It's a waste of time."
2,Pretentious and Condescending,"This is only slightly better than The Evolution of Jane. The female characters are shallow, arragant and bitchy. Frankly, the characterizations of the women seem to be written by a bitter man instead of a woman. I've thrown good money after bad on this author and won't make the same mistake again. I sincerely hope that the forthcoming screenplay left out 95% of the book and rewrote the rest."
5,THE LOVE LETTER,I truly loved this book. The intrigue of Helen finding the love letter and not knowing who wrote it is wonderful. Her affair with Johnny can make you feel young again.The book is wonderful but you must read it before you see the movie or you will never want to read the book after seeing the movie. The movie goes way off the mark and turns the story into a comedy but it is really a romantic drama.
1,A huge disappointment,I enjoyed Alice in Bed years ago and thought I'd like this one -- I had to force myself to finish it. I found both Helen and Johnny totally uninteresting and very hard to believe. Completely pointless and boring -- the first 100 pages were the hardest to get through. I can only imagine how bad the movie must be!
5,More Than Expected,"This wood rack is more than I expected. Quality materials, superior construction, and heavy duty cover. Should last for many years to come. Can't go wrong with this one!"
3,not what i thought,"This book has a review on almost every kind of toy car, but leaves out the prices of a lot of them. There is almost no selection for hot-wheels, but there is a lot of selection for matchbox. My problem is that I have cars with no model numbers, which makes this book useless. I was able to find ERTL and a few others I had though."
4,Compact and easy to use,"This is a great player. The size is amazingly small but the sound quality is great!The software that comes with the player is a little difficult to understand, but I took their advice and downloaded the plug-in for Real One Player. I find it easier to use and with many more features. I do save my favorite cds as mp3 and the sound quality does not diminish.I agree with the previous reveiwer about the headphones...the ones provided, though great sound, are very short. Great if clipped to shirt pocket or armband, but not to your shorts or even holding it at arm length. I bought another good quality earbud and am using that instead.Overall....good quality, good features, great sound."
2,"Dishonest seller, this is not a Denman brush",The brush is advertised as the D6 Denman brush but this is a dishonest description on the part of the seller. This is NOT a Denman brush! It is a similar shaped but generically made fake. If I had known I would not have purchased it because I have a Denman D6 and was getting another one for my sister. Denmans are distinct for their quality. There is not point in me returning this brush shipping would be more than I paid so I'll just keep it.
1,bad vendor,"What a rip off: $6 for a single shampoo brush! My former barber sold them to me for $2 each two years ago. Besides that, the advertising is deceptive because the (D6) next to the brand name gave me the impression I was ordering six brushes for $6.Denman Be-Bop Shampoo Brush (D6)"
1,Not a good product,"I do not like the product.I believed a was buying a newer, more improved version.Do not recommend.Denman Be-Bop Shampoo Brush (D6)"
3,When you hear this.......,"you realise what a disappointing CD 'First Class' was. I remember watching the video to this on 'Yo MTV Raps' and eagerly awaing an CD realise that never came. I won't say that he's the greatest MC per se, but his voice rides the beat, giving a straight up course of some old-skool Hip hop. As an avid collector of 'old skool toons, just one will be going on my Ipod ASAP"
2,Total POS,"We saw this toy on our way out of Toys R Us, it was at the customer service counter because somebody had returned it. That alone should have been reason enough not to buy it. We came home and put it together only to discover what a total piece of junk it was. However, once we ditched the ramps my son really enjoyed the main portion of the toy that has all the buttons and stuff. We kept it for that reason alone. He does play with it, so it wasn't a complete waste of money."
3,Parts constantly come apart,"This toy is cute overall, and my son likes playing with it, but every single time, I have to put the parts together for him. He gets frustrated and I dont like that it wont stay in place. What fun is a toy that comes apart so easily and has to be fixed every day?"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,This product is not worth the money at all. The cars are too big for the ramp and it does not stay put together. The age range is 18M plus and there is NO way. My 2 year olds can't play with it for 5 minutes without it falling apart.VERY DISAPPOINTED!
2,No better than the others,"Only one screen protector in an order. Very slightly (about 1 mm.) too wide for the screen of my XV-6700, so it's hard to put on. Scratches easily (even the smoothing card that came with it scratched it). Not visibly or tactilely better than any other screen protector I've used over the years, but also no worse.On the plus side, comes with disposable little finger-gloves (like little balloons or condoms) you can wear to prevent fingerprints during installation. Had not seen that before."
2,just ok,"Doesn't really give facts. There is a lot of assumption here. The acting is not great, and it seems like they are glamorizing the sad murder."
4,;0/,"This was an ok movie, withesaying that and the issues still being current and sensitive I really don't want to say much. I don't know if everything that was shown if it was actually how it happen or it lifetime fabricated other parts. After watching I still have some questions here and there about what took place. I will say this I do travel but not alot but when I travel to another country I have to be very aware because you just never know.The whole thing is so sad and in the end it's the victim that nobody remembers just this big case."
2,It's not even what it claims to be,"What this book offers is basically the same thing as the user's manual, adorned with words we mortals understand. I think that the user's manual, and a little practice, is all you need to get started with a HP 48G."
2,it did not meet my expectations,It did not meet my expectations and I do not recommend it as a first choice - there are much better pockets to use during your residency programm .
3,Nietsche and the Nazis,"Although the claim made by Abir Taha that Nietzsche was a proto-Nazi does have some credibility, her use of quotes from Nietzche's work is highly selective and, of course, designed to make her argument. The problem is that she overlooks too much of what Nietzsche wrote, a criiticism she levels at Kaufman and Hollingdale, in order to make her case. The book is very repetitive, and one has the essence of her argument after the first chapter. The books biggest flaw is that she makes Nietzsche look kind of stupid, which he was not. Anyway, the book is worth the read, but if you really want to know Nietzsche, you must read him yourself. The idea of a pure race Nietzsche thought was but a swindle. The Superman Nietzsche prophicies is, I believe, something nonhuman, an altogether different species than man."
1,Not environmentally friendly - nor complex.,Hoarding packets of condiments sounds like it generates a lot of trash - I'm not so sure about all the disposable freezer bag usage either. Some of the recipes are pretty pathetic - like instructing someone to spread peanut butter on a flour tortilla and sprinkle it with raisins is a recipe? Pshaw!!!
4,Pracitioners perspective,"This book was given to me by a patient, her brother a professor of psychology had sent it to her as a way of managing her pain. My patient suffered chronic pain and had become anxious & depressed.This book offers a wonderful insight on the nature of pain in the western world & our cultural binds towards it. The program is hard work and needs to be worked on in conjunction with a professional, in my opinion. It is possible to use it well in group work it will take 8 weeks or more to complete."
5,I love Avonlea!!!!!,I think Avonlea is the best I wish I could go to Avonlea.Everybody in Avonlea is funny!
1,Manufacturer's Error On ALL Sets,Several disks in this set are the wrong episodes. Sullivan entertainment stated that this was a manufacturer error and they would provide replacement disks. It has been several months and I have not received the disks yet.
3,Road To Avonlea Season 2,The DVDs were great but the box was all broken apart. Enjoyed the series though.
2,F Keys (F1-F12) on Keyboard Function Sporadically,"The mouse functions perfectly, but the F keys (F1-F12) on the keyboard rarely work. I searched Logitech's troubleshooting forum and found that I am not the only one who has this problem with this model. Logitech suggested connecting the receiver to a different USB port, which worked twice for me, but has never helped since. Now the F keys do not work at all. This is terrible for me because I need the F keys for games. Also, I can no longer startup while holding F8 to bring up the startup menu and disable driver signature enforcement to make some programs work (such as PeerGuardian 2) with Vista 64-bit. Looking back, I would definitely buy a different mouse+keyboard combo."
4,Logitech 1500 Laser Cordless Desktop,"Keyboard is OK, nothing special. Mouse is very good. Battery life good so far for the keyboard, and rechargeable mouse lasts a long time - I don't park it in the holder all the time, as that can reduce capacity, and so far it has run for a month without a recharge.There a NO indicators on the keyboard for CapsLock, NumLock, or ScrollLock which I really miss - easy to brush the capslock key then wonder why passwords won't work!Apparently this is common to most wireless keyboards, but I cannot find any utility that will show key status on the screen in the system tray.Logitech website does not seem to list this keyboard/combination, as far as I can see. Searching the web Microsoft support say it is the keyboard manufacturer that should supply software to do this, but Logitech SetPoint doesn't!For above reasons only 4 stars."
4,A suberb collection of audio biographies!!!!,"Three cds are enclosed in this boxset all telling the amazing story of the world's greatest band. Two cds concentrate on each of the songwriters Lennon and McCartney and the third tells the tale of the Beatles. It includes interview clips with each member of the Beatles and enclosed are some great photos of the band. This is a great little collector's item, with fantastic packaging!!"
3,"Nasty, Nasty","A good read but, a bit ""naughty"" for my taste. Dah, fell under ""romance"" section which I didn't notice. Was into the whole Vampire thing for a bit but, didn't read anything else by Maggie S. after this. This book is a trilogy and I have to say I couldn't put it down until the very last page! (Then I trashed it.)"
3,My opinion:,"This book has articles on many asteroids going beyond the first four,using interpretations and sample charts of famous persons. But what boggles my mind is that in this,and other books dealing with asteroids beyond the first four, for interpretation of asteroids in the chart, the authours only interpret ASPECTS between the asteroid and other bodies. I cannot find one book that has interpretations for asteroids beyond the first 4 in each SIGN and HOUSE! All I can find is info on ASPECTS! I want info on asteroids in the signs and houses!"
3,Not the ultimate,"This really doesn't list all the asteroids, but it is a good one with a general ephemeris of the most common asteroids in the back. Good for psychological analysis."
5,perfect cabinet handles,I was able to finish my kitchen cabinet project with the purchase of these handles. The handles completed the set that I needed for placement on the cabinets doors and they are a perfect match to the existing handles on some of my cabinets doors.
4,Great Fantasy Background,I like this very much. Its a nice background sound effects. Can't wait to try it on Halloween nights too. Its there a Volume 2?
1,Home movie quality,"We borrowed this from the library as we are going to Peru in a few weeks. This seriously had the production values of a home movie, and was about as interesting. Please don't spend money on it! It was nice to see the scenery and so on, but while the description says ""learn how they make dye"" you get a few minutes of shaky hand-held video of a villager doing ""something"" with some wool. And so it goes."
4,Same ol',"Just as short and awesome as the first few seasons. I do hate though how they stretch less than 20 episodes onto 2 disks to make it a ""box set"" and I'm super irritated at the ""play all"" joke on this disk."
4,Read it,"Very Good Book. I learn English from it. No need to live in '60s, Clover brings them to you. I read for wife and she kick me out. I still have book though, makes good fire. I recommend to anyone who needs encouragement.-"
3,A noble lady with loose morals,"I was disappointed that within the first couple of chapters, the hero and heroine meet once,then on the second meeting they have a romp in the hay and she gives up her virginity without much of a second thought. I just couldn't identify with either of the two characters. My favorite and most liked character was the 'villian.' I didn't even like the hero's brothers much either."
4,Bannerman's Promise,"I love the entire Bannerman series, and I would suggest reading all of them ... but in order. Definitely start with the first Bannerman book (The Bannerman Solution)."
1,Where are the recipies!,"Whereas I do believe in the content of this book on FM, I must say that the title is misleading! I bought it thinking it would be full of recipies - there are none to be found here!"
5,Slick everyday knife,I collect knives and this is a good one for everyday use. It works very good and it takes and holds an edge well. The seration comes in handy for tough cutting.
1,hitec servo,this is a terrible servo i had it in my xtm x-terminator for a throttle servo it stopped working after 5 minuets i dont suggest buying this servo at all buy a higher quality servo not a 9 dollar servo its a wast of your money
5,A great action drama,"Though U.S. Marshals is not as good as its predecessor, The Fugitive, it is still excellent and the plot was super."
4,us marshals,the movie was shipped and arrived quickly. The film is amazing and I love it. The disc was in great shape.
4,US MARSHALLS,"This is one of Tommy Lee Jones best movies, not as good as the Fugitivebut still action packed. Lots of drama and action."
3,"A Few Flaws, but some exciting moments","THE FUGITIVE it is not, but U.S. MARSHALS has some exciting action scenes and chases. My favorites are the airplane crash and the shootout in the cemetery. And Tommy Lee Jones dressed as a ""fried chicken"" mascot leaves a lasting impression. Wesley Snipes seems out of joint in his character, but his pole vault escape onto a subway car will jolt even the most worldly wise action fans. Don't look for much insight in this film. It is stylish fun, and the short feature about the history of the U.S. Marshals offers some interesting background material. Maybe after seeing the film, you'll want to try out for a federal star, if the action grabs the ""Wyatt Earp"" in you."
3,If you watched Fugitive you dont need to get this one,This Movie is so much like Fugitive but not nearly as good. If your really into Tommy Lee Jones or Snipes then you may like it.
3,A Fugitive Retread,"This movie was good, nice action from start to finish, but it was just a redo of The Fugitive only with Wesley Snipes playing the part that Harrison Ford played originally. The locations are different. There are some minor differences but it is the Fugitive rewritten to make a sequal. If you like Wesley Snipes and Tommy Lee Jones, then buy it, otherwise just watch the Fugitive again."
3,I've started losing more hair after 2 weeks of use,"I had good hair but i faced some hair fall 18 months back, and till date my hair hasnt got its original volume back.After reading all the reviews I bought this product and started using it. But for the past one week, which was when i was 2 weeks already into using this i started facing hair fall again.even if i run my fingers through my hair they are falling and coming into my hands.I wanna know if anyone did face this issue?should i stop using this right away?"
5,Foreword Magazine-Industry Trade Publication,"BOOK OF THE YEAR-ROMANCE! This book was honored as Book of the Year, Gold Medal at the Book Conference in Los Angeles in May, 2003. This book continues to receive many awards. Get it while it's hot. It's a wonderful, fateful story."
2,Or Not So Simple,"I bought this book hoping for some clarity on the End Times. Unless you are extremely well versed in Scripture and have a broad and extremely inteligent vocabulary, this was not an easy read . While I learned many good points, it took a lot of rereading and highlighting to understand what he was trying to say. I do consider myself somewhat educated having a college degree but, needless to say I gave up after about half way through as it was just too much work. Maybe this is for the well educated Christian reader."
5,Very Cute Book,Adorable. My husband and I both enjoyed reading it. We can't wait for our son to graduate from board books so that we can read it to him.
3,Not an original story,"I like this book fine. It has a cute story and delivers a good message.However, ""Not Norman"" is not the first book that has a goldfish story.Dan Yaccarino has written ""The Birthday Fish"" about 4 years ago. It was about a girl named Cynthia who wanted a pony for her birthday, instead she received a goldfish. The two books have the very same ""main idea"" : a child who received an unwanted goldfish for his/her birthday""."
3,Great mouse while it worked...,"I don't like using touchpads and I got this mouse for my laptop about 6 months ago. I use my laptop a lot and take it from meeting to meeting, and absolutely loved this mouse - its size and retractable cord made it really easy to take around with me.The only issue was its short life span: it died on me last week, without warning. No LED light, nothing. By reading the other comments, it looks like I'm not the only one who experienced this issue.It is so convenient that I would buy it again, if Targus updated this model. For now I think I'll stick with a sturdier model, even if it is bigger."
2,Too hard,"I bought this mouse and it's giving pain on my wrist. It's too hard to click and it has a slow response. I fell in love with the size of it, but, unfortunately, I only read the review about the fragility of the piece after I bought it. I had a Kensington 72114 for years until my niece saw it and took it with her. It's still working. I am going right now buy me another Kensington or two. I couldn't find it in the stores."
5,Great Little Mac mouse,"Sorry to be brief to the point here, I'm just writing this as a gesture to others so they can have an informed purchase experience the way I usually do based on reviews. So let me just state that this is a great little mouse for the price I paid. I bought this for a Powerbook, I was hesitant at first because the specifics were not clear enough about Mac compatibility but it is. It works wornderfully, specially in tight little spaces or any rough surface. It also matches perfectly to my platinum looking laptop. There were no connection issues, it instantly recognized the new device when plugged to the usb port. Buy it, you won't regret it."
3,Nice Idea ... not very solid,Mine's still working after 9 months although it's a bit touchy (i.e. unresponsive) at times. I find it helps to full extend the cord. The concept - a mini mouse for my laptop with a little memory on the side - is a great one. But the quality is only fair.
1,Way short of expectations,"I bought this mouse thinking it would last at least a year. I bought 4 of them so far and none of them have lasted more than a month. It dies after one month of usage. This product is garbage, I tried emailing the company to complain but it is like pulling teeth trying to contact the company. This product is definitely not recommendable. If I could give it zero stars I would, but I can't, so I gave it a one star. Garbage. I never leave reviews, but this product really made me mad."
3,Worked For One Year,"I loved this little mouse up until this morning when it suddenly died. No light. No USB detection anymore. Plain and simple, after closer inspection, I realized that the wire was the culprit. Probably broken somewhere. This mouse would be better off as a cordless, then it would be fantastic."
2,Targus optical mouse,cannot adjust the setting for the mouse. cursor goes fast with Windows XP. Checked website for support. There is no support!Company said you cant make adjustment.
1,It Died after minimal use/less than a year,I purchased this for my laptop. It worked great at first. There were blue and red lights that would brighten up when it was awake. Not anymore. The blue light completely stopped working. It used to be plug and play. Not anymore. Basically it is useless. It just doesn't work. It was used probably 30 times at the most. Complete junk. I like the smallness and shape of it though. Time to try a different brand.
1,Not So Good,"I have owned two of these mice now and I've had to replace them both. On the latest one, the left click button is no longer working. Which is very frustrating! It works a little if I press it really hard, but a double-click will not work.I am disappointed that I've had two of these and they have both lasted less than six months. I'm looking for a new brand!"
1,Poor durability,My mouse also simply quit working after about a month. Not a bad product if you don't mind purchasing a new one every 30 days.
1,Too much for this book!,"I am an American living in Brazil since 2005. My Brazilian wife got this book for me so I could start learning the language. She paid about $10 U.S. for it in 2003. $99 is ridiculous and of all the learning aids I have purchased and used for Brazilian portugues, this book was the least effective and has many grammatical errors. I didn't see them but my wife and her family, who all speak good English started to pick the book apart when I was having difficulties and showed me what the author had done in many cases, was to interpret what he thought was right, when in fact he was not correct. I wouldn't recommend this book at any price.Rosetta Stone is far better with audio and visual aids, if you really desire to learn portugues."
2,I didn't think Jerry Pournelle could write a bad book...,"...but this is it. Recycling old plots is an honored sci-fi tradition, but here Pournelle and Stirling combine at least two or three and can't really make a unified whole out of them. I found the ""Casablanca"" references distracting, the Kzinti childrens' quarters irrelevant, and the Thrint subplot extraneous, and (as in ""The Stone Dogs"") even Stirling couldn't give me a believable, comprehensible war in space. If you're a known space fan you've read a lot of this, and you don't need to read it again."
5,the best book ever!,"I'm actually 14 years old, but i just had 2 write a review 4 this book! When my mom got it, it kinda intrigued me because I'm into all the druid and wiccan stuff. Also, my family background is Scottish, so i decided the book would b kewl. I'd have 2 say the best character in the book is Brid. She reminds me a lot of myself. and i know how she feels 2 lose sum one she loves more than ne thing. This book is like seriously amazing! the way its written makes u wanna keep reading without stopping! i think reading 'On the Edge of Darkness' was all i did when i waz up at my cousins cottage. The book is excellent, the characters unforgettable and the storyline is bloody amazing! U all have 2 read this book! in my opinion, its the best book I've ever read in my life."
5,A truly wonderful and inspiring novel!,What a wonderful novel! Reading the Ladies Auxiliary was such a pleasure that I could hardly put it down. Mirvis has created a novel that is so humourous and inspiring that I found myself laughing and crying throughout. I highly recommend this great southern novel to all of YALL readers out there!
3,An OK book,"The theme of a conservative community whose balance is upset by a newcomer is a popular one...probably because it makes for good, if not profound, story telling. The idea that ritual without meaning is pointless is hardly news, but it doesn't hurt to point it out again. This book isn't brilliant, but the writing is acceptably competent. A friend commented that it reads like a long magazine story. I'd have to agree."
2,Is Life this Dull,"I began reading this book hoping to learn something about the life of an Orthdox Jew and in the end I did. However, there was nothing really driving the story and it was tedious to finish because there was nothing to look forward to. The characters showed the flaws of us all but they were unrealistic in many ways. I found it hard to believe that a communty like this really exists."
2,Doesn't live up to its promise,"After a fascinating prologue, this book falls flatter and flatter with each succeeding chapter. The characters become two-dimensional stereotypes, the plot slows to a crawl, the humor degenerates into preachiness. This book starts out with great promise but ultimately devolves into mediocrity. Such a shame!"
1,"Sorry to be a wet blanket, but...!","So many people seem enthusiastic about this book, but I can't help wondering how much actual literature (as opposed to pulp novels) these ""Ladies' Auxiliary"" aficianados have read. Mirvis is an exceedingly earnest writer, and I want to root for her, but her prose lacks artistic imagination."
3,OK Read,"This book was a selection for a book club, and I had high expectations. The story was interesting at first, but it got tired by mid-way, and the characters lost their spark by the end. They started out in a way that made me want to learn more about them, but never seemed to gain depth. I had trouble relating to the characters, although I can imagine that they aren't all fictional. I wanted to relate to Batsheva, but it felt like Ms. Mirvis didn't want the reader to get too close to her; I wanted to know more about her. Some loose ends bothered me, like where Batsheva's daughter was when she was out at night. I liked how it was organized around an annual calendar. I enjoyed it enough to finish it, and I'm interested to hear other's thoughts - it will hopefully spark some interesting discussion."
4,Southern yentas dramatize a universal theme,Orthodoxy of any kind is at the same time comforting and confining; it's a paradox this author kneads into a very engaging story. Some of the characters are a bit caricaturized (can there be a more cartoonish busybody than a Southern Yenta?) but they work well together to dramatize the dilemma faced by so many people: do you follow the rules or follow your heart?
1,Poorly made,"Skip this. I purchased due to the excellent review on America's test kitchen. The wire clip that holds it closed broke off the first time I used the basket. Nice idea, poorly executed.Back to Amazon it goes."
1,Dangerous and cheap: not the All Clad I used to know,"I bought an All Clad tea kettle over ten years ago from Williams-Sonoma, and it was beautiful and wonderful. It was almost identical to this one. My original developed a leak at the weld around the spout, and I took it back under warranty and received this style as a replacement. I HATE IT. It's not as pretty, because the spout lines are different (they fixed the weld issue which elongated the base of the spout in an awkward flat spot) and they added plastic to the underside of the handle. The new spout shape causes the kettle to spit water all over the place when pouring. Also, water leaks out of the lid when you pour. So it's difficult to not get burned, while also not making a mess, and never mind actually putting water in the cup where you want it. Plus, the plastic handle gets very hot. I am really, horribly disappointed and see this as the end to my loyalty as an All Clad customer."
1,Portrait of an evil man,"Arafat was an evil man.In his life, what did he achieve?He killed a lot of Americans and Israelis. His Palestinian people are in lousy shape. While Israel has built up a democracy and world class economy, and have created tens of thousands of jobs for Americans, all the Palestinians can do is create more suicide bombers.Thus us the legacy of Arafat. A failure and a loser."
1,This Network Simulator is lame.,These labs do not come close to reflecting the complexity of the CCIE one-day practical lab. I finished this entire CD (all 5 labs) in under an hour before breakfast. These exercises are not at an intermediate/advanced level as advertised. Very disappointed - an absolute waste of money.
3,Should be more to it for this price...,"I was really surprised that Cisco considers this ""Expert"" material. I am no where close to ready for my CCIE exam but I ripped through all five labs in 2 hours. There are no difficult puzzles to solve here; It's all very straightforward configurations. It's not bad, it just needs more labs and more difficult scenerios."
4,Better than the product description,"The product description states that this is a ""24-port 10/100 switch."" It's actually better than that.The D-Link DES-1026G has 26 ports, not 24. Twenty-four of the ports are 10/100. There are an additional two 10/100/1000 ports on the right hand side of the front panel. All of the ports provide auto crossover when necessary.The two 10/100/1000 ports can always be used as two extra 10/100 ports. The real advantage for me is that I can connect a cat6 cable from the gigabit Ethernet port on the server directly to one of these ports, even though the installed wiring in my law office is only cat5. The 10/100/1000 ports are also useful for daisy chaining switches.The only reason I awarded four stars, and not five, is that I can't evaluate reliability at this time."
1,Who Cut Out The Cheese?,"I don't see how they can get away with calling it 'blue cheese'. I cannot taste any cheese chunks in this particular dressing. Calling it ranch seems more appropriate. This appeared to be the predominant flavor throughout.I know this is one of the 'budget' salad dressings available in the local grocery store. And it might explain the composition.But because Kraft is obviously famous for producing cheese products, they should put a little more work into this particular item. They could probably do it."
2,AP Product 002-47809 Plastic Welding System,"This product may be fine for the plastics that it's intended to work on but, it doesn't work on all plastic and that's something that you don't find out until you receive the item and read the label. It doesn't tell you that, on the Amazon web site when you purchase it. Even when you get the product and read the label, you still won't know if it will work unless you happen to know what kind of plastic that you are trying to mend.I just had to try it to see if it would work. It didn't! I wouldn't buy this unless you know what kind of plastic you have and can find out what plastic it is intended to mend. I no longer have the label so I can't post that information here. FYI, this is not a Plastic welding system. It is simple a two part epoxy."
4,recommend for cleaning grout,"One of the showers in my new-to-me house was in very bad shape grout-wise. After trying a lot of other methods of cleaning it up (to no avail) my mother gave me a Clorox Bleach Pen - and it worked wonders. 2 ounces did not go very far, so buying them in bulk makes sense. Having these come in a larger size, however, would be preferable (and it should result in less plastic packaging per oz of product)."
3,Narrow Market,"Choosing the Right College is a helpful guide book but it is directed to a specific market. The selection of schools is a bit random. The insights are mostly helpful; however, this book seems to be written for parents and their teens who are interested in attending colleges that are friendly to their ideological preference. Don't expect to see all major state or public universities. Interesting but not thorough. If you have money to spend, buy it; otherwise, look for a more complete guide."
2,"Great Features, battery. Poor picture","I originally had the Samsung DVD-L75 that is a 7"" screen with a 4.2hr battery but had some problems with the DVD drive so I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to the Panasonic. I'm so disappointed with the picture quality that I'm thinking of exchanging it back for a new Samsung. The picture quality on the Samsung was very bright and sharp that it rivals my Toshiba HDTV. The Panasonic looks like an old 80's tv where you can see the little squares that make up the screen.Since picture quality is a high priority for me, all the nice features and battery life of the Panasonic isn't enough. Once you see a good quality picture, it's hard to downgrade. If it's your first one, you probably wouldn't notice."
1,don't purchase any Panasonic products,"Don't purchase any products from Panasonic. The warranty is useless. Company policy is warranty for 1 year but it excludes labor which is only under warranty for 90 days so you have to pay $100 to get a ""replacement product"". They don't even try to fix your product. They just send a replacement if you pay the $100 dollars."
5,5 Years Old and Still Ticking,I bought this one and the silver w/black strap over 5 years ago and they still keep time perfectly. The indiglo is still working and has maintained it's brightness. The only thing I have changed is the brown band and the batteries on both. I would buy them again.
5,my watch,"I love this watch , I did remove the leather wrist band and put on a silver expanded wrist band."
5,I love this cd,I have this CD and the lyrics reminded me how love can go wrong and also go right.Thats cool how they're brothers. The lyrics has touched my heart. These lyrics reminded me once I had a dream that a girl when away from me and I said say you'll stay by my side. And told how much I had loved this girl.
4,Looks great/installation is tricky,So I got this great the next day I ordered it and I looked at the instructions on how to install it and they were very vague and I had to figure it out on my own (thank god I know a thing or two). I installed it it took me about an hour to get the measurement right but other then that looks GREAT. 4/5 because instructions were not clear enough.
3,Its alright,found it for a lessor price in an Oriley's a day after it shipped. It needs a little more design work to fit on smaller shafts properly. but after adding a layer or two of duct tape and some loctite it worked out.
4,Great playing,"Richie Hart is an accomplished musician. He has outstanding tone, and really hits the Wes concept really hard. Unfortunately i felt like i was listening to wes instead of him. I think hes got his own style but its almost too wes like for my own tastes.I have had the opportunity to study with Richie Hart at a Berklee guitar camp and hes an outstanding teacher and an outstanding person/musician. He is truely a vetran and deserves alot of respect."
5,whats not to like,made for smaller wrists (perfect for me) easy to set up. keeps good time and easy to read even in the dark with the lighted dial.also should not forget that it costs about $30 less than at kmart store. so great deal all around. thank you.
4,Looks nice,"I bought this for my 22 year old son who is very picky, he likes it and is wearing it everyday. Timex is accurate and holds up well."
4,Very nice watch for the investment!,"This watch is light weight and comfortable to wear. The band fits comfortably on my medium / large wrist without pinching. I’ve worn this watch snowboarding, wakeboarding, mountain biking and surfing without any issues.The time is easy to read in all situations. However, I can’t say the same about the date and time . The size of the date and time display is a bit small for my 56 year old eyes to read.All-in-all I like the timeless look of this watch (blue face / white hands & numerals). I expect this watch will last for many years as my family has enjoyed Timex watches for generations."
5,My Timex,I have had nothing but good luck with Timex watches in my lifetime. Iplan on sticking with a winner. Thanks
3,not a big fan,"I've watched her videos on youtube before and they were awesome.What I thought was bootcamp, seemed more like a rhythm based, tapping correlation that I absolutely did not have.Preferred Jillian's 30 day shred over this but that's because I'm not correlated to do these tapping routines."
5,"Finally, a DVD for REAL people!","I love this DVD for so many reasons. Coach Nicole is so personable and encouraging. Her ""back-up"" girls have ""real"" bodies -- something you don't find very often on workout DVD's. The 28 plan on the DVD is awesome -- just click on the day you are on and it automatically starts the workout. So cool! I haven't seen any other DVD's with this feature. Finally, there is a count-down clock on the screen so you know how much time you have left, which definitely helped me stay focused and motivated!"
1,POS - do not buy,"I have had this product for about 18 months. It has given me nothing but trouble. The string breaks, as it will on all trimmers, but on this unit the string gets pulled into the head and jams the heads so you cannot bump it out. I have to stop the engine, get a screw driver, pry the bumper off and restring the reel every time the string breaks. This is the biggest POS I have ever used. I will never buy another Troy-Built or MTD product again."
1,Frustrated and Tired of Pulling,Purchased this machine a few months ago. Used it twice with some excitement. Third use has been impossible to start. I've nearly pulled my arm out of socket pulling the starter line. Instructions on the side of the thing for starting have proven useless. Engine refuses to turn over. I will be taking it backt tomorrow for a full refund (I hope). Save your money and your rotator cuff.
3,okay,"it's quiet, but does not have much power. nice not having to mix oil and gas, but just average for a trimmer"
1,Horrible product. Horrible company.,"I bought this and was very excited to use this trimmer. It broke after the second use. I took it to the local approved service shop. They figured out what broke quickly and ordered the part. Long story short, two and a half months later the part came in. At one point, it was in the shop for longer than I had owned it. Every review you hear about the spinning head is true. Not sure who designed that, but wow, it's horrible. The handle also doesn't lock into place, so if you get resistance while trimming or using the edging attachment I also purchased, the handle rotates in your hand. Then you have to stop, twist it back, then keep going.Overall, this is a piece of garbage soon to be on CL. Look elsewhere."
1,A marketing snow job!,The advertisement for this book and the reviews are typical of what happens in a marketing sham! The book is very dated even as it claims to be a SAFE version. It is very poorly written (grammatically and otherwise) and it covers information that is readily available for free elsewhere. That I paid $45 dollars for this book is something that I will remember for a long time to insure I don't make the same kind of mistake! Definitely not recommended!
5,EXCELLANT PRODUCT,this phone system is excellant.i like the hands free part as well as looking at the camera watching my doggies outside on porch from the handset.it is one of the most unique phones i ever had. even the phone installer complimented me on it . great buy.every one will be envious.
5,crystal users,"a friend of mine had this book. that is why i knew i wanted it. it is a great book. it talks about crystal energies,meaning,scrying. it also touches on your aura and your chakras.lots and lots of pictures"
5,wow,"this is a perfect rock n roll record. energy, attitude, and charisma, coupled with the occasional face-melting guitar solo. that's all i need. goes good with beer."
2,it leave the WORST lint,"I really like the effectiveness of the wipes, but they all (no matter what scent you use) leave the WORST lint all over whatever you're using them on. It's even on my hands after I've thrown the used wipe away."
4,"A good read, but a little boring. Just a little.","I really liked Miguel's books better, but overall Susan's book is a prety good read. Regardless of what your read, the toltec path offers a way to be completely happy."
2,Where's the Toltec?,"Perhaps I'd have been better off with Mr. Ruiz's Agreements, because this one left me scratching, where's the ""Toltec"" in this Way? The impression left is that the author has distilled and blended axioms and beliefs to her fancy. This in itself is not a bad thing; many ""ancient ways"" require a contemporary language for us to comprehend. But this book only left me starving for substance. Granted there are some beautiful anecdotes emphasizing the need for our harmonious existence with nature and eachother, hence a couple of stars..."
3,they call this a BABY?!,"these things are hideous. and i dont get why the creators had 2 make their legs so dang big! and these dolls that are supposed 2 be cute ""babyz"" look like teenagers! they wear teen clothes! it even says in the little song playing during the commercial, ""causing TROUBLE....."" and, ""TROUBLE never looked so cute....."" it should say, ""trouble never looked so ugly....."" the only thing good about them is all the clothes and accessories they have. i think the original bratz babyz are WAY cuter than the bratz BIG babyz, but they only made a couple fashion packs for the original ones and they already made a TON of stuff for the big (and ugly) ones. they need to make more stuff for the original, small bratz babyz. they are so much better and cuter. some people might think that bratz BIG babyz are cute, but i am definitely not one of those people."
1,Totally Inappropriate,"Why would I buy my child a doll that looks like a slut? Why would I want to tell them that this is ""cute"" or ""funky""? I don't want my child dressing this way and emulating a ""sassy brat"". I sure as heck don't want a Bratty Trampy BABY doll.It's disgusting and disturbing and should be recalled and rethought. I won't buy one but I'm entitled to my opinion. If my girls had friends who played with these dolls I would question their motives for owning such a self degrading ""toy"""
3,biased toward the west,"The author includes dozens of towns from California and Oregon, but only four total from New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut combined. Many of the small towns in the northeast are the heart, soul, and heritage of America, but the author -- all of whose books except this one are guides to California and the west -- seems too distracted by gimmicky tourist and ski resort towns to notice."
2,Four States: Nearly 40% of the Getaways,"Seeking an eatery, or quotidian travel brochure information for a destination in California, Oregon, Washington, or Colorado? Then this is your book! Nearly 40% of the author's best American getaways are found in these 4 states alone. If, however, Pennsylvania, Tenessee, Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, Nevada or one of eleven other states intrigue you, forget about it; you'll find a total of only three town listings in these 20 states combined. Useful weather data are provided, but otherwise the lack of geographical balance and unique insight left this reader rather disappointed."
1,Total disappointment,If you are looking for some meat about debugging then this is NOT your book. IT's not beyond a debugger documentation.
2,A Rush wanna be.......,"I've listened to his local show and his national show, the book was what I expected, a yawner. The one thing Ed Shultz lacks is class and respect, something he does not give his callers. One thing Ed needs to realize is just because people don't agree with you doesn't give you the right to hang up on your callers and belittle them. Sorry Ed you'll never be a Sean Hannity or a Rush Limbaugh,"
5,Great for Cast Iron Dutch Oven Cooking!,We use this pan for cooking in our dutch oven. it is heavy duty enough to handle cooking charcoal for hours in it.
4,"Oh, so fun!",I love the easy instructions and stitch explanations. And the patterns are cute and fun to do- plus they're reusable! The pockets in the front and back a perfect for saving used patterns. Definitely a smart choice for a first time embroiderer.
2,Weirder than Teletubbies,"This was my first WeeSing video, and I will not be buying any others. My 11 month old son usually loves anything with songs (Veggie Tales, Sesame Street, the Muppet Show, even that commercial for the Countdown Kids CD set), but he completely ignored this video, and I don't blame him. The songs are short and the introductions are long. Also, this appears to be a collection of bits from other episodes, put together in a way that seems very disjointed. I find the adults dressed up as animals creepy, worse than the teletubbies. I don't see how any adult can stand to be in the same room while this video plays."
3,So-So,"My therapist recommended I find a guided relaxation CD to use at night. After checking out the other comments people left, I decided on this one. I'm only half pleased. The first time I used it, I was relaxed, but not enough to fall right to sleep - or stay asleep all night. I actually woke up more than normal. Since then, I find my mind wandering while I listen, and haven't found it to be all that effective. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found Serina's voice a bit annoying and even hokey. This is my only guided relaxation CD, so maybe when compared to what else is out there, it wouldn't be so bad."
4,"Well, They Work",What more can you say about condoms than that they work properly and feel right? So these do.
3,"i bought 4 packs, and none of them were complete","So; i bought 4 packs (48 condoms with 2 rings), and none of them were complete.2 of them were 40 out of 482 of them were 42 out of 48"
4,Durex Condoms,So far this selection of condoms have been great! Haven't used the the vibrating rings yet. Waiting for special opportunity.
4,"Quick, discreet, and a bonus!","Quick delivery. All condoms are lubricated. Packaging included a coupon for 10% off next order.4 varieties with 12 condoms per style- Durex Natural Feeling- Durex Intense Sensation- Durex Regular- Durex ExtraWith 2 vibrating rings with condomsDate ordered: Dec 8, 2010Date received: Dec 11, 2010Price: $13.75Price per condom: 27 cents!"
4,"Good, affordable printer","If you don't know which printer to buy, and if you don't have any specific needs, this printer is a good choice. (However, if you don't need color printing, go for laser) Although it's bit noisy, it is not that loud. Printing speed is decent, and quality is very good for its price."
4,Great value!,"My boys love this Play-doh set. They are very into tools and this is perfect. The ""swiss army knife"" tool is a favorite. I'm not sure of the purpose for the little ""wiggly"" (their words, not mine) pieces, but overall it is a good set for the price."
3,MP5 Review,"Overall i like this airsoft gun. it shoots preety straight. its light and compact. the only cons about the gun are that the scope sucks. it has a + as the dot and it is to blurry to really see through it, the clip w? the bullets looks preety cool exept for that the clip doesnt catch so you have to hold it to shoot. and also the other clip it comes with only holds 10-15 bbs at a time so that sucks to. and also the gun broke a few months after i got it. the safety doesnt work so it is always on auto and it doesnt shoot. in my opinion if you buy this gun be prepared for it to break and/or replace some of the parts."
2,Eyewitness London,"I sent it back for I just didn't need it. It did seem to have nice photos, but I didn't look at it for plans changed and I didn't need it. Thanks Amazon for allowing me to sent the book back. That is just another reason I like your company."
2,"Great pictures, but no analysis","The book has great maps and nice pictures, but doesn't help with making decisions for what to do on limited time. It also doesn't provide tips on avoiding lines or what days are best to go like other books"
1,Careless Editing,"This book had so many errors that I began to doubt the credibility of the text. When you read a book like this to pass the VB 5 Exam, you can't be questioning it's credibility. New Riders fortunately has a 5 page listing of errors that you can download from the website, however, I found that only about 30% of the errors are listed on the download sheet. Do yourself a favor and look for another title!"
3,Not Bad but....,"This book teaches the fundamentals of VB5 but leaves something to be desired in some of the code examples, I have reviewed this with other like myself that have used VB5 and previous versions and we have all came to this conclusion, please tell the publisher to have more people review code in texts before release..(and possibly try to run it)"
4,Over the Top,"I read this book over ten years ago and it had a place of honor in my library until it disappeared while moving. If one wants to get a 1st hand and what I feel is a fairly accurate view of what soldiering must of been like , this is the one to read about War One (""The War to end all Wars"") and the British Army as seen thru American eyes. (Example - How the mess kits were cleaned by using mud.) I can also state that the glossary of terms used by Tommy Atkins was both amusing and informative. Tommy by the way was a very cynical and humorous sort of fellow. While this book is not as good as Robert Graves ""Goodbye to all that"". Which also is part of my library. On the other hand, Graves could not not write about the others ranks point of view since he was always a Commissioned Officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. All in all though a very good read and well worth the time if this period of time is your forte."
5,'01 Caravan,"Was very happy to see the wipers show up early and in perfect shape thanks to the decent packaging,overall A+ all around =)"
5,Must read for any 5 animal student.,This book is more than a manual of combat. The gigantic gap between using kung fu for fighting and using kung fu for creating peace is masterfully and poetically bridged in this book. Any martial artist should have this book handy as a constant reminder of why they are studying this mysterious art form.
4,Peters Renders Unto Caesar!,"Most of the time he's working out of Hollywood--and managing to stay very busy! This time, Toby Peters, ace private detective in Stuart M. Kaminsky's ""Buried Caesars,"" has his hands full again. But it's a special ""order""! General Douglas MacArthur (a real ""American Caesar"") contacts him for help. It seems that the general is contemplating running for political office once he's out of uniform. Alas, however, one of his assistants has run away with the campaign funds, but some critical (and very sensitive) papers, as well. Along the way, Peters is joined by Dashiell Hammett (until he gets kidnapped) and this period piece detective story is off and running. While it lacks the suspense and poignancy of Kaminsky's Inspector Rostnikov series, this is fun reading! No, it's not P.D. James, but a good mystery, nonetheless! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"
3,Barack Obama - Inauguration soon,"This DVD is definitely alright, but I feel like I wanted to see something a lot more comprehensive. I've been following Obama's campaign from the very beginning, and I have to say that it's been a long journey to success. The best DVD I've seen so far has been President Barack Obama: The Man and His Journey. Vivendi Entertainment put it out, and it is so much more informative. It has special features (like a Presidential trading card) and interviews with Martin Luther King III, George Lopez, and more. It's so well made that I was even more impressed AFTER I watched it at how incredible Obama and the campaign have been. I've heard that it officially comes out Inauguration Day--January 20th. I don't mean to completely bash the PBS DVD, I just think that there's better out there. Plus, it's a keepsake essentially--a great way to look back at how we lived through such a historic election."
5,great film,"Been around horses on and off most of my adult life, this is a great documentary for horse people. I would also recommend it for non horse people, it is a very powerful and inspirational documentary about an extraordinary gentleman, with some very important life lessons."
3,Buck,"Okay, I suppose one cannot expect too much from true story type films,however this was rather slow and I did expect more."
5,Horseman Supreme,"I don't write reviews. This is probably my second of all time. This is one of the most entertaining ""documentary"" videos I have ever seen. While I am not young, I am new to horses and horse (people) training. I have been amazed with what Clinton Anderson can do and this just continues the learning of how to truly work with horses. But is so much more than that! Buck is just a ""regular guy"" who dedicated his life to being the best horseman he can be. He is truly an amazing horseman and human being. His personal story while shocking in the early years is heartwarming and moving. I would recommend this even to people who do not work with horses. Wonderfully done, a true pleasure to watch and learn from another of todays true horseman. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,honest look,"Horse Whisperer is one of my favorite movies and Buck seems to be an honest look at the man on which the movie was based. One can clearly see that Robert Redford captured the man's quiet dignity and compassion.I only gave it 4 stars, as I rarely or never give anything 5 stars. Dumb, but that's the way I am. This should not deter one from seeing Buck, however, as it is moving to see that it is possible for a boy coming from an abusive childhood to become a man that can look inside these animals souls and heal them and inspire us to rethink our approach to life."
5,BUCK,"Buck Brannaman's book of ""Far Away Horses"" told the same story as in the movie, only it did it in more detail. The movie enhanced the book as I had the opportunity to visualize what Buck was talking about in the pages that I read. In addition I got to see and hear him instructing in the movie and mentoring to the owners of their horses. The movie gave me a visual look at Buck's life. I would like to attend one of his clinics just to see and hear him work. You don't need a horse to learn from him as his lessons in training, communication and compassion transfer to everyday life. The scenes Cindy Meehl chose to bring the story to life do indeed enhance everything I have ever read or heard about Buck Brannaman. Whether you read the book first or see the movie first, both are very inspiring and I recommend you see this documentary, it is very well done."
5,Buck,I purchased this as a gift and she loved it. She had seen the CD before and enjoyed it ahnd commented that she wanted to buy it. The order arrived promptly.
1,Boring Documentary,"I guess I was expecting a story line, not a documentary. Like several others I read the great reviews and was expecting a lot more. I have had horses all of my adult life, so its not that I don't like horses, I just not interrested in hearing how Bucks dad used to beat him. Save your money."
4,Smaller bad than I thought,"Bought this so I can make green tea cake and cupcakes. When I opened the package, it was a smaller bag than i thought it was going to be but I guess a little goes a long way? Great price."
5,A must read for marriages,This is a must read for all marriages. In fact I have bought it for a few people who were struggling in their marriages.
3,Love & Respect,"When I tried to order this, it said I had already purchased it. So I should not be charged for this one."
3,Love & Respect Workbook: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately Needs,"The notebook had been previously written in. Although I bought it used, I didn't expect the questions to be answered by somoene else. My bad I guess."
5,marriage mender,this is an excellant book.i recommend it to everyone to read this BEFORE you have problems. like read it on your honey moon!!but it takes effort to change your marriage. Use the info in this book to provide you with the tools needed to rebuild your marriage.
4,maybe we love it too much...,"My wife and I bought a set of Master Chef (before there was MC2) pans 3 and a half years ago, and the 10"" N/S skillet was the best part of it. All-Clad is heavy stuff, no hot spots or cold spots. I love every piece that I own, and have been completely satisfied with the set, except that now, the exterior of the pan is discolored (I really don't mind that part, it just means that we love it; and no, we haven't used it on a gas range), and the non-stick surface is not so non-stick anymore. I cooked salmon, of all things, an oily fish(!), in a dry pan, and it stuck. Maybe we've just worn it out, but my next non-stick pan is still going to be All-Clad."
1,Returning pan,"Purchase one of the 10"" fry pans April 1, 2010. Non-stick coating is peeling up off the edge of the pan. I am returning the pan to All Clad.Pretty disappointing as I have owned a LOT of cheaper brands and never had the non-stick coat simply peel off the pan in a sheet like this."
1,Do not buy these,I think that these dolls are sending a bad message to girls my age. Why do they have to look so trashy? Their make up is so thick and clothes hardly cover their butts. My mom taught me that a girl can look nice without looking like that. I threw AWAY THE LAST DOLL I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY!
4,Tough Game !,"This is a tough game even with the G25 racing wheel. But fun as well as tough, like all of the games just a learning curve."
3,Not to shabby,This isnt for the faint hearted.This game reminds me of the old Papy Grand Prix game.Its NOT arcade.You need to drive the cars here and throttle control and breaking tech it critical.
3,Not bad,"My biggest concern was whether it would work well on Vista, which it did for the most part. However, having played it for a month now, I have to say I am underwhelmed. The cars and the control (I use the Logitech Momo wheel) are good, but the training modules are not availabe. How else am I supposed to get better at driving if the training environments are locked. I haven't done much to look at forums to find out how I can unlock them, but an interface for a game should be more intuitive."
5,Its pretty darn good!,"My hubby writes: Ive been using this for 2 weeks straight now. I have family over and I gave up my bed. I set this thing up every night and haul it away in the morning to conserve space so i needed something that was easy to break down and put away - so an airbed was out of the question. Its a little tricky to setup the first few times because you need some brute strength to get the end bars on. But once you learn how to do it, its up within a few minutes. ive gotten quite good at it. Im 190 pounds and this thing handles the weight. its a good buy for sure"
3,Unable to snap on the end bars together.,I pulled and stretched the cot for 6 hours and couldn't assemble the end bars and almost hurt my fingers. I returned the cot since I wasn't able to assemble it. I gave it 3 stars because the cot seems to be made of good materials.
4,An ok gun,"This gun it pretty good for a beginer, but when i purchased this product i didnt get the protection vest as said in the product description. i might contact the sell but im not sure yet"
5,This book has something for everyone.,What I liked about this book:It was very well edited with a great introduction to the genre of Alternate History. A great book for someone who has never read any AH as well as a long time AH reader like myself. This book has something for everyone. My favorite story of the collection was Must and Shall by Harry Turtledove
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I had ordered this for a friend for Christmas, as we'd seen one being used by friends at a BBQ. I'd searched everywhere for one without a handle (hard to find!), and this one was exactly like the one we'd seen. It arrived quite quickly, it was exactly what I wanted, and my friend was so happy when I presented it to him and his wife at Christmas. I'm looking forward to enjoying some of the delights that will come from it."
5,All Clad is great as expected,It's what I expect from All Clad; excellence. The exterior is brushed and that was a surprise but makes it easier to clean. Nice heavy pan.
1,"Not the color you expect, lasted less than 2 months!!!!! Don't buy this brand!!!","The color of the bulb is blue, but the color of the light is just normal as any other replacement bulb. It's a little misleading, because you would think the color of the light it produces would be somewhat blue, but not at all. SO if you are looking for the blue lights don't get this! This brands just plan sucks. The bulbs lasted less than 2 months and both went out within hours of each other."
5,A must own for any Shape Shifter,I have used and read many a tarot deck over the years and this one is by far my favorit. In each card I can find a bit of myself or the person I'm reading for. Anyone that feels a connection to animals and plants would find this deck of human/animal hybreeds easy to understand. Spend some time learning the cards and in them something about yourself.
1,a bit embarrassing,"When I ordered this I was working multiple jobs, and frankly never realized that I didn't receive it. The only way I discovered it was looking through old orders for a title of a book I ordered a few years ago. This order shows shipped, but it never came. I guess since I have multiple decks and had so much going on in my life at the time that I just never noticed. its a shame because when I looked at this deck I really liked it. I would have loved to try it out. maybe I will order it again from a different seller. Again, sorry the review and realization is 2+ years late. no refund for me I guess."
3,"Great Comfort, Can Rust If Left Outside & Cheap Details","I sat in this chair at a friend's house and then had to get one for my own backyard (I like to watch shooting stars and this makes it much more comfortable late at night to sit and yet look up).While the chair really makes you feel like you're floating due to the way it fully wraps underneath you, thus spreading your weight, the steel grommets all along the sides immediately started rusting!The chair CANNOT be left outside unless you cover it or move it inside. This is really a problem since I just want to leave it there to make my life easy; now, it looks kind of ugly with all the rusted grommets, though the chair itself is just fine. Speaking of which, the armrests use some cheap soft-touch padding with adhesive underneath; one of these was applied slightly crooked (someone can't just lay a sticky pad down correctly?) and I'll survive with that as well. I guess everything too-good-to-be-true has faults as well."
3,the hip hop equivalent of punk rock,"this really sucks...but in a good way! i've heard that all this guy uses to make his albums is a casio and four-track for the beats and headphones for a mic...it shows. to give you an idea of Sensational's lyrical prowess on da mic, ""party poopers needing pooper scoopers"" is a recurring theme throughout this album."
2,Average content,"The content of this book just provide very basic concept of SEO, nothing advanced. Wouldn't recommed to people who want to polish their SEO skills."
5,woodgraining tool,"This should have been available at Home Depot!! They had a picture but no product. Amazon price was great as well as the tool itself, Easy to use with great results. I used it on a metal door that now looks like real wood!!"
3,Too redundant even for children.,The book goes on and on and on forever as the various parties try to get the coat off. It could be shorter by 10 pages and everyone would be better off
2,HAD TO SKIM TO GET THROUGH IT---,"For me, this book was so overly wordy in parts that I had to skim paragraphs to get through it (which I hate to do.) It was interesting reading about India's past, but all-in-all the story and characters (especially the heroine, who without a care leaves her beloved hero for dead...twice?? and don't get me started on the ANNOYING relative) never really captured my attention and/or fondness."
3,Annoying Labels,"The products themselves seem nice enough, but each one had a long (6"" maybe) sticker on the handle that has been incredibly hard to get off. I tried peeling them off, scraping them off, rubbing them off under water, etc., and they are now going into the dishwasher in the hopes I can get the rest of the glue off. I wish manufacturers would remember that the last thing consumers want is for their first experience with a product to be fighting with it.UPDATE: Washing them did nothing to remove the glue. We will be buying some goo gone to see if that works, but bottom line, add in the cost of glue removal to the cost of the product. Other than that we are happy with them."
5,Nice video,"I remember watching this series when my kids were little, and we thought it would be nice for our grandkids, and they seem to enjoy watching as well."
5,Sensual this is!,"Working on dance routine and this helped to relax to flow like silk with no stress. Going to film my dance and put it on You Tube to show I have mastered one of the versions of Belly Dance as working on 3 other versions to master: Tribal, Turkey and Oriental. Dance I am free to flow as wind, fire, and water with a feeling of earthly pleasures light as silk without a touch just mist there but not just a dream. I have others that want me to teach them how to belly dance as I am happy in finding freedom. Just need self defense classes to combine the moves with dance, pity the fool that messes with me. Never ever belly dance without a protector as words are not enough that no harm will come your way."
1,Didn't Work on Our MAC,"My son received this for a birthday gift. We own another I SPY computer game and it worked great. This one would not even launch. It was given as a gift purchased through Amazon but wrapped up and handed to my son, not given through the mail, so no packing slip. I tried to return this. First, I needed to know the giver's email address and home address to verify that this was indeed bought at Amazon. Fortunately, I had that information. The customer service person verified the game was bought at Amazon, but through a third party seller, so they were not obligated to honor a return. She did send me the third party information. They would not take opened software back. How do you know it doesn't work if you don't open it up and try it? I just spent eight dollars UPS shipping it back to Scholastic in hopes of an exchange. Other I SPY games do work on MACs, but this one did not. If you are going to try this, buy it from a store which will take it back if it doesn't work."
2,Why ?,"Why on Earth would someone want to read about a F-q driver who clearly never was menat to be a Champion, who blew every opportunity he always had driving the best F-1 cars, and who entered F-1 only due to his great contacts with BMW ? I don't know. Anyway, this is good reading for fans only, because you have an idea of the setup of the categories of the time (F-3, F-2) and the drivers who competed in them."
4,Solid work but not his best solo effort,"First, let me say that I am an unabashed Don Henley fan. During his tenure with The Eagles and throughout his solo career he has written and sung so many wonderful songs, overall the work doesn't jazz me as much as his later solo albums, ""The End of the Innocence"" and ""Inside Job."" With that said, if you're a Henley fan and don't yet have this CD, you really should buy it to fill out your collection."
4,Don Henley makes a great solo album!,"Don Henley is truly a great singer, and this album does not dissappoint.He definitely has his own style. This has some absolute gems on it."" The Boys of Summer"" is a classic all time song. The perfect hit song that is timeless."" Sunset Grill"" is also great and "" Driving with your eyes closed""This is a mainstream album, and many music fans would enjoy Henleys workTop music!"
4,A Little Disappointed,"I thought the treasure box would be bigger. It is very small about the side of the furniture that fits into my daughter's doll house. The details are nice and the box the treasure chest arrived in was exceptionally beautiful, I have it on display as well. For $22.00 I guess you are paying for the box. The seller shipped the item quickly; I order the item on a Monday and received it by Thursday."
2,Don't Waste Your Money...,"Don't waste your money. Buy the 8 in pan. It's a real All-Clad. As I read these reviews, I keep seeing people rave about how good All-Clad is, not really how an individual pan actually performers. Yes, I have All-Clad. Lots of All-Clad. When the company brings out a new pan, I buy it. In the small pans that I use the most, I am likely to have 2 of each. But, I don't recommend the 7-? inch. All-Clad likes to bring out pans that are almost a `try me'; as was the case with the 7 ? inch and 1 qt pan a few years ago. They priced them attractively. To me the pan is handle heavy. It does not sit properly on my electric stove. Thus it has poor heat conductivity. For a few dollars more, buy the 8 inch fry pan. The 8 inch is US made, and the 7 ? inch is imported."
4,A great little fry pan,"This is a great little pan when cooking a quick meal for one. Contrary to other reviewers, you CAN cook eggs with it, granted, a little non-stick stray or butter helps.The secret to All Clad cooking is to use low heat and pre-heat the pan. All Clad products conduct heat so efficiently, it's easy to over heat the pan. This will cause food to stick and burn."
3,"7"" fry pan","This fry pan is great for small items like pancakes and eggs. it does tend to stain if you leave butter in it too long, but it cleans up very nicely with just cameo metal cleaner and water to make a paste, and rubbing it with a washcloth."
1,Received USED Pan,This looks like a good buy - but be careful - I received a used pan in the mail that still had film on it from its previous use.
4,"Good things, small packages, and small price tags","This is simply a great little pan -- emphasis on both ""great"" and ""little."" Like all the pieces in this All-Clad line, this pan will last your lifetime unless you absolutely abuse it. But before you buy it get out a ruler and be sure you realize how small 7 inches really is. It's even a bit too small to do a decent omelette in, in my opinion. But in tandem with larger pans and for small saute jobs it's indispensable, and at this price well more than worth the purchase.If you're starting from nothing and need a main fry pan, you really should be looking at least at the 10-inch or, more realistically, the 12-inch pan. However, while you're at it, pick this one up, too -- since you really need to have at least one ""support pan"" anyway -- and count the money you saved here against both pans."
3,NOT GOOD WITH EGGS,"THIS PAN IS AWFUL WITH EGGS,I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE NAME.I TRIED THE NON STICK SPRAY,AND STILL THE EGGS WERE AWFUL.i LOVE THE WAY IT LOOKS,I MIGHT JUST HANG IT ON THE WALL AND BE DONE WITH IT."
3,gets old after while,you can't even hear whats she's saying! GOOD PART:its pretty cool when you first hear it. BAD NEWS:gets really old after while.
3,its ok for 6-9months-ish,"First of all, this book is all bugs which I didn't realize when I ordered it. My baby is just not that into it. She likes the Lamaze Peek-a-boo forest book better and has from about 6 months to now- 10 months. This one she grabs and flips through quickly (too quick for me to say anything but the bug names) and sometimes touches the bug wings. She just seems more interested in the animal books- maybe because I make animal sounds when I read them- who knows? Maybe she'll like this better when she is older."
5,A terrific buy,"My three month old daughter loves this book. We can't even get past the cover b/c she loves the crinkling sound it makes. The colors are bright and vibrant, and its filled with lots of different textures as well...from the fuzz on the bee to the cordoroy on the worm, to the nylon on the dragonfly. I've also tested the covering over the snail and it seems very durable. I've tugged at it with all my might and it stays on just fine. I've even test-chewed a little and it seems like it could be chewed through, but it would take quite some time to do. The instruction tag says to ""surface wash only"" so that's what I do and the colors stay fine."
3,"Nice, but fades with washing and construction is not up to par","First of all, having any type of baby/kid product that is only 'surface washable' is a JOKE!!! Stuff gets on them and you have to wash them every now and then to freshen them up! That being said, I washed this book and was shocked to see how much it faded after just one washing on the delicate setting.When I got the book, the stitching on the pink worm was already unraveling.My baby does love the crinkly page and enjoys this book, but the overall quality isn't as high as it could be.I don't think I will purchase any other books in the series."
5,One of the Best SOFT BOOKS out there....,"I purchased this for my son when he was around 9 months...should have purchased it sooner.It has the most adorable critters/insects in it...and the words/poetic lines are just tooo cute! I have washed it several times & No tears.some fadding but thats ok,it's still a great book..we love it! makes a great gift;)"
4,Great first baby book,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. My daughter was only 3mo when I got this and she was just getting to the stage where she wanted to touch different textures so it is perfect. The first page is very distracting though because it makes a crunchy noise and as all parents know babies go crazy for that stuff. All in all, I'm very pleased with this book. I can give it to her and not worry that she's going to hurt herself if I leave her alone with it."
5,Love it!,I love reading to my little boy and this book is perfect for kids who are interested in books but too little to read. The soft cover is great and there are so many interesting things for him to touch on each pages. I would highly recommend this book for any baby!
4,my son loves it! but poorly put together,great rhyming book! front page crinkles! my 4 month old son loves it and loves the contrasted page borders. he chews on it. only issue i have is some strings seem to be coming out from the binding?
3,Delayed Customer Service Response,"Contacted about general sizing of this product 2-3 weeks ago and still haven't heard back from them since the first e-mail saying ""not to respond to message"" as they will get to me soon. No one checked in to update my inquiry and so have not and probably will not purchase this item from this seller."
4,My 2 1/2 year old loved it,"My 2 1/2 year old boy loved the detailed, colorful pictures and the silly words. The story is adventurous and appealing. There may be some strange and extraneous parts of this book but they did not loose the attention of my child."
2,Holes in the plot!,"With names like Snoopsie, this book is just a little to ""precious"" for a parent to read too often. My four-year old always points out that on one page only, Stinky is wearing different clothes than on all the other pages. So parent and child are both frustrated with this book! I'd recommend maybe checking it out from the library, but I wouldn't buy it."
4,Fuel belt,"I like this belt because you can adjust it around your waist so that it won't bounce around. I sweat a lot, so having this belt avail for long runs is a necessity. When I go running, my hands rarely swipe the side water bottles, though if u have long arm swings the water bottles will get in the way. Also wish they would of made the back pockets bigger so that I can place my cell/ a couple of GU gells on one of the pockets."
4,Gift for my husband,"I haven't actually used this, as it was a gift for my husband, so this review will be based on what he has told me. He wasn't sure how to wear it at first -- he said it felt more comfortable with the bottles in the back, but how would he reach them then? So he wore it with the bottles facing front and said it worked great. It was nice to have access to them when he was out doing his long runs, and the pockets were big enough to hold a small set of keys or a phone, if needed. He said the bottles didn't jiggle too much while he ran, and they also didn't get in the way of his arms. The bottles themselves, together, provided enough liquids to get him through his 13-mile runs, but he's not sure how it would work when he gets to his much longer runs, as he used it all up within the 13 miles that he's at right now. I hope this helps!"
4,CBI Henderson - Fascinating Book,I just finished reading the book. WELL DONE !!! This old navigatorwas fascinated by it. And the book-within-book feature was mesmerizing.Thanks for making it available.
3,A Lazy Feel to the Album,"Hyaena has a lazy, almost boring, quality about it that makes it ideal for insomniacs. It's impossible to understand Siouxsie's hatred of guitar players but she seems to fire them after every album, and sacking John McGeogh after their magnificent release, Juju, was a huge mistake. They never again recovered that haunting, scary guitar work on classics like Spellbound,or Monitor. Robert Smith, of The Cure, attempts to take the controls but fails miserably, as each song's riffs sound like an acoustic, unplugged album. His greatest contribution is in the piano-playing on the superb Swimming Horses. Smith looks as though he is about to have a nervous breakdown in the album sleeve, and one can assume this is the fate in store for all guitarists on Banshee albums. The standout track is Dazzle, a great hybrid of classical music and gothic rock."
2,what could have been....,"When the Cure's Robert Smith officially joined the Banshees as guitarist, I expected great things. Dazzle and Swimming Horses are the only decent songs on this album. A missed opportunity."
5,Teenage Liberation,This book has expressed the thoughts that have been hidden in everyones mind for a century because of being supressed and considered stupid.
2,How awful does this get?,"...I thought the whole idea of 'teaching yourself' is totally dumb! I mean, homeschool is not going to give us the experience we need! Not only does school teach the given classes, but it also teaches us lessons in life, and gives a reason to wake up everyday. We know from summer vaction experiences how much a teenager CAN sleep, and trust me if school did not start early in the mourning we would not be up! So trust me, homeschool does not work! Also, I think the author of the book was totally trying to 'relate' to teenagers! My best advice: don't try! you don't know what you're talking about!"
4,The Powershot,The Canon Powershot 7.1 mp is a very efficient camera. The quality of photos is quite good.
4,my wife loves it,"So does my daughter who used it so much we got her one. Brother in law loves his. Ours broke, but Canon fixed it with no hassles. Could do better in low light conditions, but overall very functional."
3,Watch Out for the LCD Screen,"First the possitive. This camera takes a great picture and video quality isn't bad either. I don't use the sound on the videos so that isn't an issue with me. The LCD screen is big and makes it easy to take quick photos and video. However, my screen cracked while in it's case while strapped to my waste. Wasn't dropped, bumped or anything. Canon's reply is send it in and we'll decide if its covered by warranty. Camera is only 7 weeks old. There was only about 20 minutes time passed between taking a picture, putting in the bag and pulling it out again and finding the screen cracked. I just think the screen needs to be a little tougher than that. Perhaps mine was bad to begin with we'll see what Canon does with it. Battery life seems a little disappointing also. I had a cheap Nikon that cost half as much took just as good pictures and the batteries lasted longer and it was only a 3.2 mp."
3,Beware the SAND!,"I loved my 550 while it lived, but one tumble in the sand at the beach and it was DOA. Canon Service sent it back as ""uneconomically repairable"". I know that sand is bad and after it happened and the camera refused to function (lense would not extend), I put it away until I could ship it off for service. I did not expect the camera to be totally trashed. My friend's Nikon CoolPix came through a similar mishap with no problems on the same trip. Now I am off to look for a more robust replacement (read NOT a Canon)."
1,Flash works for few days,I bought this camera and flash did not work from the day one. Canon replaced and second camera's flash worked for few day. This camera has problem with flash.
2,Cracked LCD screen - Beware!,"I've been a Canon fan ever since the original Elph 300's, but this camera is putting my faith to the test. The SD550's screen is terribly easy to crack compared to prior Canon's I've owned. I've had the camera for 9 months with no trouble, and then the screen cracked when I put it in my pocket. I went and got a new screen off eBay, and it was only a week before it cracked again. Do not buy this camera if you plan on taking it out of it's box and using it.Good luck! I'm currently looking at the SD630, as it seems to have a stronger screen, but it doesn't have a viewfinder... Look for a broken SD550 on ebay soon."
3,Adorable but NOT durable,"The elephant is absolutely adorable!However it is not durable at all, especially for a toddler. My 2 and a half year old son played with the elephant for about 2 minutes before the seam across the back of the elephant split open. If being used for JUST decoration its great, otherwise the stuffing will be coming out in no time!"
5,My daughter was THRILLED to get this elephant for Christmas,"This elephant is HUGE! I have an almost-3 year old daughter that really wanted an elephant for Christmas....I splurged and bought this for $40ish (which is A LOT of money for a stuffed animal in my opinion) and I will say.....IT WAS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR! My daughter is very tall for her age (100th percentile for height) and weighs 34lbs. She can sit on her elephant, it doesn't cringe or buckle, and kiddo's feet don't even hit the ground. LOL! (if I could figure out a way to upload a photo I would) Anyhoo...same day she got this elephant she named her Kelli. She's a keeper and a part of the fam now."
5,Big Elephant,"My 2 year old grandson fell in love with this elephant at a photo shoot. They took a few pictures of him with it.....we were there so long that he really thought that this was his elephant to take home. I felt so bad for him that I had to find him one.....and I did on AMAZON.com.....the price was great and shipping was fast!!! He was so excited when it arrived. He sits on it, plays with the trunk and tail.....and pulls it all around the house(by the trunk), but so far it has held up beautifully!"
5,To Love an Protect,"Jonah Marriott borrowed money from Lydie Pearson's father.Lydie's mother contacts her and lets her know they are about to loose their family home, because Jonah never repaid the loan. Lydie's mother is in need of a bi--h slap.Although very shy, Lydie works up the nerve and she goes to see Jonah.She confonts him about the loan, Jonah knows the loan was repaid long ago, but he gives Lydie the check for the amount she asked for + interest.Lydie puts the check in the bank as Jonah told her to do.Then when her father finds out about it. He is ticked, it seems he can't pay Jonah back the money.Lydie goes back to Jonah, saying it's his fault.He agrees, but now how will she pay him back.Jonah finds away. he firstes a date with Lydie and then they become engaged.Lydie wants more than just his need to please and keep her father safe, she wants Jonah' love.Jonah loves her from the time he sees her 5 years after first meeting her"
3,Just OK,"Decent array of songs, but like so many Greatest hits type collections, has some fluff and filler that hardly qualifies at ""Essential""."
3,Free Bird - Great!!!!,"This is a very good CD for Free Bird!!! Collects all the classicsthough I kinda dont think Lynyrd Skynyrd is that great!! Theydon't rock hard, and they made some weak songs too. I'll givethis CD 3 stars because I love Freebird and is a classic 70's.Sweet Home Alabama is also great!!!"
3,Spill saver gas can spout,"Tried this spout after having nothing but trouble and spills with the totaly stupid ones that come with the new ""non-spill"" gas cans. For some reason I decided to order two. Glad I did. I could not get the first one to not leak between the adaptor and the spout. The 2nd one seems to work fine. Overall it seems to do the job but we'll see how it holds up to repeated removals when filling the gas can at the pump."
5,All-Clad 3 qt. saute pan w/lid,"Love, love, love this pan! Can't imagine a kitchen without one. Bar Keepers Friend for heavy clean-ups. Not too heavy, but has some weight. Just REALLY love it!"
5,Best cookware brand I've ever used,"Consistent, durable, and will last a life time if you take proper care of it. I will never go back to a lesser-quality product."
5,Great tool!,"Great quality, solid construction, easy to use, no guess work. A little more money than some of the craftsman wrenches...but well worth it.Even came with a nice case."
5,Great Torque Wrench regardless of money,"Very good quality torque wrench, came with its certification card indicating how it tested at various torque settings. Not only is it a great torque wrench, it isn't that expensive when compared to similar quality ones that are usually twice as much, such as snap-on, mac etc..."
2,Not what is described,"I ordered this pot thinking that I would be getting a shiny stainless steel pot. The Product Description clearly states that the exterior of the pot is shiny and the words Stainless collection are used a few times. However, I received a Brushed Steel Professional pot. Very disappointing. We'll see how the seller handles the return."
1,WRONG ITEM,"The item sold by Firefly Buys is not as advertised by Amazon. This is NOT the classic 3-ply Stainless line. What arrived was a 5-ply version with a brushed stainless (not polished) exterior. Very heavy and does not match my other All-Clad pieces. The lid also had a poor fit on my other pots with the same diameter. Model number on the box is D55204. There was also no dust bag in the packaging, which leaves me wondering if this is a new item or not... Will be looking to return. Know what you are buying!!"
1,"My First, and Perhaps Last Taste of Joyce Carol Oates","Anyone out there a fan of Joyce Carol Oates? Never having read anything by her, I was given Middle Age, A Romance by a friend. I tried to read the book because I enjoy trying out authors I haven't read before. Made it through part of the first chapter, then jumped to the ending pages, and finally somewhat skimmed the pages in between.My reading time is precious and the characters in this story did nothing to engage me in wanting to spend the time to meet them or know more of their lives. This was soap opera at its best (or worst, depending upon your opinion of soap opera). On top of that, I found the book overly wordy. Not wanting to follow that path, I'll stop here in my review!"
3,"great album, bad CD","I have always loved this album. I have long considered it to be Siouxsie and the Banshee's most minimalistic album and a triumph for that. I adore Tenent and clockface and skin and pretty much every song on this album. But I have to say that if you can find an unremastered version of this CD then you should get that one instead. For one, as mentioned elsewhere, the bonus material is not great. It's not worth it unless you want to hear Siouxsie singing a fairly uneventful version of Christine over an equally uneventful, repetitious loop. It's novel, I suppose, but not something you'll really ever go back to, kind of like the bloopers at the end of a movie. The overall sound quality of this CD is somehow worse than before the supposed remaster. This version brings out something shrill and a bit TOO raw sounding for my tastes. The songs sound thin.I bought this and listened to it a few times, was horrified at how awful it sounded and then dug out my older CD instead."
5,Be dazzled by the Kaleidoscope,"Siouxsie and the Banshees' 1980 album was ""Kaleidoscope."" With 11 songs, this album continues the progression of their developing sound. Although the album has an 80's sound, the songs have a lot of variety. With upbeat songs like ""Happy House,"" mellow songs like ""Lunar Camel,"" catchy ones like ""Christine,"" and weird ones like ""Paradise Place,"" one has a hard time picking a favorite or classifying the album. The unique sounds of Siouxsie and the Banshees make this album an excellent addition to your collection."
3,Wedding invites,"Bought this for my wedding invitations.The customer service was great, but the product is just okay. The piece with our address is rubber and takes some serious arm work to get a good emboss. Doing 150 invitations was a challenge and we wasted quite a few envelopes because the address was only half embossed. It's good for use daily maybe but not doing invitations. Go with an ink stamp."
1,13 months = DEAD,"It was great while it worked during the warranty period. Too bad about 3 weeks afterward, it stopped playing DVD's. Think I'll spend another $250 on a ""top of the line"" DVD player from Panasonic? Oh no, I won't! If this had been a $50-$100 ""throw-away"" player, it wouldn't have been a big deal. Time to do some research on who knows how to make a quality DVD player."
3,Had the same U70-2 problem as cardinal pilot,"In a nutshell, this player does an outstanding job doing what you want it to. I just wanted to add, however, that I had the same U70-2 problem as cardinal pilot mentioned below. Tech support said it was a ""Macro-Blocking"" problem and sent me a firmware update CD. It did nothing. After ""Googling"" the U70-2 problem, came across Cardinal's fix and it works so far. Kind of annoying though when you pay $200+ when you can by bugless dvd players for $25. 5 stars for Cardinal Pilot. 3 stars for Panasonic because of the bug."
3,Waste of Money,"I have been using nail brushes for years. Since I work in a shop, my nails and fingers get extremely dirty. Well the brushes I got are for tiny tiny little people with even tiny hands. Since they were so cheap, I will use them till I find the adult size of nail brushes."
4,Excellent,All-Clad is a huge thumbs up for me. Made osso buco in this pan and it was a dream. The only thing about this pan is how incredibly HEAVY it is. It would have been 5 stars otherwise.
3,"Does Little Debbie offer Rice Crispie Treats? If not, then this is the best product she's dished out!","These are pretty yummy. Nothing extraordinary, and probably more sugar and fat in them then we would like, but they are good.3 stars."
3,the dirty little boy,I read to children once a week at my public library.The bright colors and art work contribute to this being one of their favorites.Nice book.
1,Not compatible with my computer; a brand new Dell,"This software will not work with my computer which has Windows XP Home on it. They provided two work-arounds, one didn't work and the other one was to start pulling RAM off of the computer. LUDICROUS! This product should not be marked as compatible with Windows XP."
1,wouldn't install,This software wouldn't install. It hung and crashed my windows XP PC three times in a row. Junk!
4,A Great Entry Level Laminator,"This is a solid product overall.It's a little clunky to try and use at first, but once I got a feel for using it a few times...it produced clean lamination with few bubbles or errors.There are ""higher end"" laminators out there, and if you laminate on a regular basis, you might want to look at others first. But if you only laminate once in awhile, this is the perfect one for the job."
4,Good for moderate use in the classroom or home office,"The Cosmic 125 laminator does a good job as long as you don't expect more than it promises. It is intended for 3 mil and 5 mil laminating pouches, which do not necessarily protect or preserve documents as much as you might want (for that you could need 7 mil or 10 mil pouches). But, it provides an obvious size advantage over the Cosmic 95, handling documents up to 12.5"". The only surprise was how long it takes to heat up, but once it was it ready to go, it proved easy to use. One minor issue was that the dust cover/feeder tray was tricky to open, but, all in all, a good value for the money."
3,"A workhorse, but buy the one with the loop...","This 4 quart pot is one of the two pots I use the most (along with the 2 quart). It is a true workhorse. It's perfect for pasta, especially spaghetti, for up to about 4 adults.One important note: buy the one with the loop! It's worth the extra money. As another commentator mentioned, this pot gets very heavy when full. My aunt pointed out that older people, or smaller women, might have trouble with this. Trying to lift and pour this pot can be quite a workout. I wish I had the one with the loop opposite the handle. (Better yet, I wish I had 2 loops instead of the handle. That one is called the 4 Quart Casserole.)"
3,Walking in this World,"As Julia Cameron has done so well in her previous Artist's Way books, the Artist is supported and encouraged on their journey to recovery. Although there is a sense of repetition in the exercises, her words read lyrically, as music for the soul. The Artist is lead page to page by inspirational quotes, reassuring in their absolute truth and direct application to daily life and vignettes from an artist's life fully lived. A must for the recovering creative spirit."
3,Handle could be much better,"I found the handle to be extremely uncomfortable in the hand. It is too narrow and the deep groove digs into the hand. For this money, it should have a better designed handle, something more ergonomic: solid and round and contoured for a better and more comfortable grip.It's a pity, because otherwise it's a superb pan."
2,Nearly killed me!! and pointless,"Dont underestimate this sauce like me, after have the neck on some cold pizza. I can only describe extreme pain, sweating, heart palpatations then fainting. My room mate found me on the floor and he thought I was dead.Also worth mentioning to treat it like any other chilli i.e. wash your hands after use as the chilli heat transfer may travel to embarrassing places!"
3,disappointed,"The book was well written but I found myself slightly disappointed, as based on the book description I was expecting to read a novel where there is a lot of verbal sparring between the two main characters, but instead of verbal sparring (which,by the way, I love to read), they got married quickly, had sex multiple times, and worked through a few misunderstandings. The book was a good read but I almost didn't finish it just because it wasn't what I expected or wanted to read at the time."
4,"Funny, touching, and sexy","I really loved the characters that Donovan created. The love story is wonderful and classic, but not in any way predictable. I love the chemistry that the main couples have. Great read!"
3,A bit disappointing,"Not as good as Armin's usual stuff. Needs to be listen a few times to really enjoy it. I have the feeling that he's tryin', in some way, to follow the recent DJ Tiesto's line but falls into a certain ""commercial"" wave that I hate. I was so excited when I heard about this new album but a bit disappointed when I first listened to it. It's very uneven. There's some tracks that are too soft and, lets say it, boring. However, some good stuff at the end of the album that reminds me of real Armin's talent : good mix, good beat. An album still good to listen ... in the car!"
5,Excellent resource for continuing your study of Georgian!,"This book is a wonderful resource for students beyond the beginner level. It has a good review of grammar points, especially the notoriously difficult verbs. The best part of the book, in my opinion, is that it gives a wide range of examples from Georgian literature in Georgian. It is difficult to find many of these even in translation in the US, much less the original text. Obviously the authors both know the language well and love Georgia and its culture."
1,Avoid this book,I speak Vietnamese well and purchased this to help me learn to read and write.The pronunciation keys are off and there are many grammatical errors in this book. There is no accompanying audio help. This seemed like it was rushed to print.I recommend theThe Rough Guide to Vietnamese Dictionary Phrasebook 3 (Rough Guide Phrasebooks)instead.
2,Its a dying tech ! not worth it any more !,"I did get it for a film class . But the end result is : Unless you dont want to spend the bucks in a newer hd camcorder and this is all you can afford I guess it is what it is !. It is digital and using a fire wire is good for editing but your pc must be able to keep up with the frame drop now days 3.0 is the way to go. Some will say Oh dv is still better than hd since most people dont have a bluray YET ! thats the key word yet. You can transfer hd to your flash cards anymore , dont need a blueray dvd. The cam did good in darker places I used it for a wedding and for a few tournaments. the picture is just too old to compare to the hd def. It was good in its finest day but not anymore.You will reget to pay over 300 bucks for it and the batteries are not cheap ."
4,Great Book,"I was given this novel last year as a Christmas gift and was finished reading it by New Years Day. I am actually re-reading the book again and once again I am unable to put it down. It's a great 1st novel by the young author and I am hoping for a sequel very soon. Five of my friends has, also, read their copy and agree that it's one to add to your collection."
2,"Not All Clad quality, poor warranty replacement, peels off","I've been an owner of All Clad for 15 years. My non-stick fry pan however looses it's teflon coating every 12-24 months along the edges. Probably not good for my health. However, I would simply drop the pan in the mail, send back to All Clad and almost like magic a new pan would be shipped to me within 7 days. Since All Clad was bought in 2004 everything has changed. They give you a hard time about using there famous warranty, and make the process difficult with RMA numbers, having to write something to them and wait to hear from them with a shipping number. It took them 2 weeks just to reply and give me a shipping number. Now they've had my pan for 4+ weeks and they told me it may be another 2 weeks. What's the point of the warranty? I am done with All Clad. Such a bummer."
1,Don't count on the lifetime warranty,"I have many all clad products. Like thousands of dollars worth of pans. When my non stick pans stopped working, i thought ""no problem, they are under warranty"" i called All Clad, explained the issue, and they sent me a shipping label. I sent in my pans and over six weeks later they return my pans back saying that I must have have used more than the low heat that is stated in the warranty. First of all, hat isnt true. Second, All clad doesnt have spy cams in my house to tell me i am a liar. HORRIBLE customer service. The nonstick pans are an incredible waste of money considering they don't honor the warranty. They lost me as a customer."
1,Pictures not as sharp as a Nikon,"I have been very disappointed with the picture quality of this camera. Compared to my old Nikon Zoomtouch 70, the pictures, in general, are not as sharp although they are perfectly focused.I would rate the picture quality of this camera, no better than those $10 disposal cameras.Also, the date resets each time you change the main battery, unlike Nikon which has its own internal battery to maintain dates and time."
2,Not the answer,through this would help more than it did. I was going through walls and this did not seem to help much at all. Only a little help in not loosing connection while microwave was running. Ended up putting in a new phone jack and moving router
4,works ok for me,can't compare to regular antenna for strength of signal because mine was broken from the start but this has more power and cost less than the replacement antenna it came with. magnetic base a nice feature if you have something to stick it to.
1,Waste of good money,"I researched and researched and read and read and read about what to do to get longer range from my 'long range' D-Link unit. It didn't do a thing, a real waste of money. I don't recommend it."
2,Not much help,"The D-Link Omni-directional 7 dbi indoor antenna was supposed to help my wireless connections. Since the normal power of the D-link wireless router is 2 dbi, and was not providing a solid connection among my computers, I thought that increasing the power by 3.5 times would be the answer. In short, I gained one bar on one computer with no help on the others (all on the same floor and within 50 feet). Was easy to install but no real help. Too bad."
1,Real test - ANT24-0700,"I thought this was improving reception but very little. So I did a little test. I unscrewed the large antenna from the base and replaced it with the small antenna that came with my wireless card. Guess what? Same reception! Turns out the improvement was from the fact that I could move the antenna around because of the long cable that comes attached to the base, not because it's a better antenna. I think it's false to say it boosts signal strength."
1,Poor support for military,Amazon WON'T ship this item to military stationed in Iraq. Piss poor support. Thanks a lot Amazon. I'll shop elsewhere from now on!
3,Indoor antenna for broadband,"This antenna did boost the range of my in-home network, however it is not a panacea. My line for the internet access comes in through the basement, but the wireless computing takes place on the opposite side of the house on the next floor up. There is a measurable improvement in the signal, but I'll still have to use a ""relay"" of some sort to get a consistently strong signal."
1,No Improvement,"Didn't make a difference at all. $30 down the drain, but at least the performance wasn't worse..."
2,Not much better than a stock antenna,"I have this antenna on a Dlink access point, and the benefit is only about 2-3 points improvement on the signal strength meter (that goes from 0-100%) compared to the stock antenna. This is such a minor improvement that I had to make very careful measurements just to convince myself that it was helping at all, since moving the AP a couple inches or tipping it a few degrees can make a 10 pt difference. The AP had a signal strength of 20% (receiving from a distant wireless G router) at its best position with the stock antenna, and this antenna got it up to 22 or 23. When I connected the antenna with the included cable (instead of directly to the AP) the cable loss was such that I couldn't even get a 20 anymore. With an advertized improvement of several dbi better than a stock antenna, I expected that 20% to become a 40 or so, but no."
1,Picture is windowboxed and not in HD,"I don't know what it is about History Channel DVDs, but all of them are in windowbox format (black bars on all four sides) as is this DVD set. When the picture is zoomed using the television zoom feature, the picture becomes pixelated. In addition to the windowbox problem, the picture for this program is not in HD. My advise to anyone purchasing programs from the History Channel is to purchase programs in blu ray format only. Let me say that again. If you are going to purchase a program from the History Channel, buy it in blu ray format only or you will get a DVD with a small picture and black bars on all sides. I am very dissapointed in this DVD set because it was a production masterpiece. I recommend that anyone interested in watching this program to wait for it to air on television and record it because it airs in normal HD widescreen format."
4,Laser Squad Nemesis Is Great!,It is a pity that the company creating and then the company supporting this product have removed support. Get a copy while you can. Run it straight from your disk. The install does not work on the latest Windows OS. But it is easy and worth it if you love turned-based games like I do.
4,A Must for New Drivers,Metcalf has written a perfect guide for budding race drivers.It maybe needs a new edition with updates now that Metcalf isworking with vintage F1 cars. Thanks Amazon.
2,14-inch Fry Pan...Disappointing,"I purchased the complete All-Clad set over 5 years ago and the 14-inch fry pan will need to be tossed. The teflon is fraying and coming off at the top of the pan, but not in the center. The smaller saute pan is fine as well as the other pieces, so I'm keeping those. I don't know if it's some sort of defect in the larger fry pan, but I'm disappointed. What would I do differently? Probably buy each All-Clad piece separately and get another larger fry pan from another brand."
3,Stainless can pit,"The heavy stainless All Clad saucier is functional; but with exposure to lots of water, the stainless steel can pit over time. It still has a thicker stainless layer than other lightweight cookware, but stainless is not impervious to the elements. I will seek enamelware in the future because porcelain is the ultimate nonreactive coating for cookware."
5,So Cute!,"I loved this book and truly enjoyed reading it to my grandchildren. Baby Bop cannot find her shoes!She goes through the house looking for them and trying on many different pairs, from high heels to cowboy boots. Does she find her shoes?The illustrations are colorful and the pictures large bringing the story truly to life.It is simple reading and also teaches young children about different shoes. A really fun book for young and old to share.Shirley Johnson"
1,Complementary medicine is a scam,"I only had to read the introduction to this book to get a clear picture of its agenda. Complementary medicine is just the allopathic world's way of double-dipping to maximize profits. It's okay to pop a few vitamins as long as you're still coming in for those prescriptions for allopathic medicine, and of course the big cash cow: VACCINATIONS. The big give-away to parents should be the statement that Dr Ditchek (or was it Greenfield) will not take patients who refuse vaccination. Vaccination has no role in any home where good health is desired. All those ailments: ear infections, asthma, etc are all vaccine-caused. This book wouldn't even be needed if people didn't poison their child's blood stream with vaccines. My unvaccinated child has never had an ear infection or a fever over 102. If you want a real book on raising healthy kids: How To Raise A Healthy Child In Spite Of Your Doctor by Dr Robert Mendelsohn."
5,"A ""MUST"" READ FOR PARENTS","Drs. Ditchek and Greenfield were both personally trained by Dr. Andrew Weil, whom I trust more highly than any other contemporary medical authority. Dr. Weil wrote the Foreward to HEALTHY CHILD, WHOLE CHILD and his essay makes it clear that this book is essential reading for parents of young children. I read it from cover to cover and came away empowered with a new understanding of my childrens' health and what I can do to enhance it.This is a great and important book."
3,"Well organized, but lots of obvious mistakes","The book is well organized but lots of obvious mistakes to an experienced technican. Corrections are available on the publishers website, but there are 17 pages to download for both the text and the practice exam. I experienced several questions on the actual exam of topics not even addressed in the text book. The format for the practice exams is not indicative of the format used for the actual test. Overall I was slightly disappointed with the package as it is one of the more expensive publications on the market. In addition, the practice exams on the CD-ROM were limited in quantity and required that you pay an additional fee to receive the code and activate the additional practice questions."
4,A work of maturity and discernment,what emerges is a redifine understandig of the holocaust as experienceby those who lived it..those of us priveileged to see this work (or as i think this piece of art) will come close to understanding what it was like to be there. I can thinkl of no work that brings us closer. not even anne frank wich i particulary hate.
2,Not the Size Described,"Ordered this pan because it was described as being 3"" in height. The picture didn't look like it, but it specifically said that. It's 2"" in height. Not returning it because one can always use another All-Clad pan. I love All-Clad, but am disappointed this wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Way over rated from my perspective,"I bought a 10"" All-Clad fry pan on sale having heard nothing but raves about these pans, and highly reccomended by Cook's Illustrated. I have no idea why these pans are so highly rated, they must have the most lamest most uncomfortable handles in the entire pan world. I mostly use cast iron, and have a stainless steel sauce pan but unfortunately even though the handle on the sauce pan is ten times more user friendly, it can't be put in the oven. So what do I do? It was the last pan on clearance, sales final. I had heard from the vendor that the design is changing. Maybe the handles will improve. Too bad, an 80 dollar pan is going to spend most of its time on the shelf. So much for following what other people say. Makes me wonder if most of these reviews are rigged, how can someone give a pan like this a five-star rating that isn't even comfortable to hold?"
3,Gotta watch the heat!,"My wife was looking for a replacement to her Calphalon non-stick pans, so I bought her this All-Clad to try out. It's a nice looking pan, sturdy and well-built. But the first time we used it, to sear a tuna steak, the food stuck SO bad and the oil darkened the finish. I could not get the dark brown stains out of it to save my life. Soaking, scrubbing, nothing worked! I found Bar-Keepers Friend at Target and that did the trick, but only after another 15 minutes of vigorous scrubbing with a 3M pad. This was all from ONE USE on medium-high heat!The instructions say to avoid high heat, but I would say use low to medium heat and let the pan heat very, very slowly. In subsuquent uses it's performed better, but it's not a forgiving pan. You have to be very careful. I would think a ""fry pan"" would be good for frying..?!?! For this reason, I only give it 3 stars and will be hesitant to buy another All-Clad aluminum pan."
5,Works with Windows 7 and Presonus FireStudio Mobile,"I bought this card to connect my Presonus FireStudio Mobile to my Windows 7 laptop. The installation was dead simple, Windows 7 recognized the card immediately. Once the FS Mobile was hooked up the problems with the integrated 1394 port (clicks/pops/drop outs, etc) went away immediately.Well worth the price."
2,What was this?,"I was a little disappointed in this film, but that's not to say that it wasn't at all good. It's just that having read Trumbo's brilliant anti-war pro-socialist novel prior to seeing the film made the film a little less amusing in my eyes.While the book itself was brilliant, giving us a detailed examination of the feelings, emotions and experiences of ""Johnny"" the film itself seems to add (though thankfully Trumbo's work as well) sections and experiences that weren't covered in the novel.Also missing was the cryptic ending of the book, which EVERYONE should read to get a better understanding of the nature of the story. I'm recommending the book, not the movie. The book itself is shocking enough..."
5,Terrorific as life,"Terrorific as life, ""Johnny got his gun"" tells much more that can be described with words. I was searching this movie years ago, and now that I have found it (and watch it) I can say that this is one of the greatest films ever made, a masterpiece. What Dalton Trumbo shows here will dig deep inside you. There are more subliminal messages, themes and even philosophical reasonings aside from the anti-war message (wich is omnipresent, of course). I'll get the book soon. I won't say anymore, just watch it. You won't see life the same."
5,"""S.O.S kill me""","What would you do if you lost your arms, your legs, you cannot talk and you get confined to a bedroom in some gloomy hospital? Well, that's the thing about this movie. A young man went to war and ended like a human waste. What we understand is that the war is not a joke, not a bomb and explosion movie. War is this, a mutilated guy who only wants to die to end the nightmare.Johnny give us his perspective of his environment and of his new ""world"": feeding, bath, test, people coming and so on. The continuos flashbakcs give us more perspective of his life and what he was before the accident.Sometimes hard to see, it's a beautiful movie in the end, powerful and emotive."
1,"Great, the second time around...","I was very hesitant to spend close to $160 on a single fry pan, but I had heard so many good things about All-Clad and thought it would be a wise investment. For the first 6 months, the pan was great. I loved the large size and used it often. I was just about ready to invest in an entire set of All-Clad cookware when my pan warped. I was using it on an electric stove as usual, and the pan just simply warped. I was thoroughly disappointed that a $160 pan would warp during normal use. I won't be spending this kind of money again.****Follow-up. I contacted All-Clad regarding the warped pan-they had me send it in for evaluation, and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door. I'm impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product."
5,It's BIG,"Yep, this is a big pan. But when you need something this big, nothing is better that we've tried."
2,Decent pan but expensive and no lid available,"This is a very well made pan and it cooks really well. I was really disappointed that it did not come with a lid and in fact the manufacturer does not even make one. There are several dishes that I specifically bought this for, but they require a lid to be cooked properly. I corresponded with Amazon but they did not help me find a lid that could be used, so I am on my own. May be difficult to find one that will fit right. For the price, I would have to say I'm disappointed."
2,Not great dictionary,I think Mounce's expository dictionary is far better than this.do not much expect from this. You may need another refernce aid to utlize this.
5,VINES CONCISE EXPOSITORY DICTIONARY,"I FIND THIS BOOK VERY HELPFUL AS I AM TAKING CLASSES AT A BIBLE INSTITUTE. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE, THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE ALSO."
5,El Solar Morell de Camuy:sus ascendientes y descendientes.,Es un fantastico libro de historia familiar. Su claridad y simpleza lo hacen de facil lectura y es de mucha ayuda para los que como yo estan buscando sus raices. Es el libro mas completo que he visto de su indole y una inspiracion para todos aquellos que nos proponemos escribir nuestra historia familiar.
3,Doesn't measure up...,"Robinson has compiled a collection of stories about a rather average family in the Midwest with some unusual quirks. The stories begin with nine year old Louis driving a car unnoticed and get wilder from there. I didn't find the stories to be very funny or very entertaining. Neither did the third and fourth graders that I field-tested it with.The chapters are a little too long to use in a read aloud situation and not many upper elementary students were not able to hold their attention spans long enough to enjoy the book on their own.Why 3 stars?:I will keep this book on my shelf in the classroom, but will not use it for anything. It will be around for a child to read if he feels so inclined. The stories are too long and not very captivating, but if it gets a child to read, then it has some value."
2,Too basic,"The book is focused more on personal KM than on KM as a field. Very useful the introductory part, though."
1,All Clad failed,My husband bought me a All clad non-stick pan. He spent a bundle to get me the finest and it had a warranty too. After a year the pan warped so badly that it would not stay flat on the cook top. Since it had a warranty we sent it on back to get it replaced. I used my old Circulon non-stick pan while I waited. My Circulon is very old but is in much better shape then the All Clad so it was a pleasure to use. The manufacturer refused to replace my All Clad even with the bad warping. So I warn others to buy Circulon pans they are cheaper and hold up better. The All Clad warranty means nothing. Don't waste your money.
1,A Total Piece of CRAP,"Given as a gift - same story: The fact that I primarily used high heat, it didn't last past 6 months. All-Clad said too bad after I emailed them, and called them several times leaving messages - took them 3 months to get back to me, and then that was it. I WILL NEVER BUY ALL-CLAD EVER AGAIN!!!"
4,Keeps you hanging till the last minute.,"If you enjoyed A Ruby in the Smoke you will love the sequel, Shadow in the North. Philip Pullman again uses his extraordinary ability to write mystery books. Pullman is able to connect two totally different things to add a whole new twist to the story. An example is when he had one mystery and another one that were totally unrelated and in the end it was all one mystery. I enjoyed this book as much as his other novels because of the fastmoving plot. This book is similiar to Stephen King's books. Not because of the style of writing, but because of the fast plot and suspense."
5,Another good adventure,"Realy love the way philip developes the story and carries on from the first book, many similitaries to his triliage of the Golden Compase"
1,Not worth it,I bake a lot and shortbread is one of my specialties. I could not use these cookie cutters at all. The dough sticks to the cookie cutter despite greasing and flouring it. The closed top makes it impossible to push the dough through from the other side. I had to keep looking for other cookie cutters. Too bad!
5,Great Whistle,"I purchased this for use in whistle training my two dogs. This is the same whistle I was issued as an ocean lifeguard at Assateague Island National Seashore in the early 1970s. Same great whistle, very loud, so my dogs are more likely to hear it even when up to a quarter of a mile distant. The loudness is why the National Park Service used them on the beach. That is why I bought them (2)."
1,This is not a Kids book!,"I have given this book one star ...but not as a kids book, it's more like a cartoon porn book for sick adults"
1,Child pornography,This book contains extremely explicit pictures that were deemed too graphic for at least one prison. It actully meets the requirements for pornography in most states and child pornography on some. This book is NOT appropriate for young children.
3,Doesn't look all that great,The Orange Tiger I ordered from Melissa and Doug looks better and more realistic than this one. It just doesn't look right to me.
3,Get a Real Cat,I bought this for my grandsons. I like big animals and life like. Unfortunately this scared the little one. I did better with the otter. Well made cuddly and lifelike. Good for older kids.
4,White Tiger,Very nice stuffed toy. Will be thoroughly enjoyed by my granddaughter. Arrived in timely fashion and in excellent condition. Thank youGinger Cochran
3,You will need equipment for this tape,"Instructor Dale Brabham demonstrates aerobic workouts that build muscles and concentrate on the torso and upper body. Using high energy music and simple props like exercise balls and broom handles, this regimen is designed for both men and women who want to be slimmer and firmer"
5,best pan for big curys and sauces,"After trying some high priced stick free cookware, We are back to good quality stainless. The shape of the sauciers are wonderful. The 5 1/2 quart is big enough for most jobs. You can sear and add the liquids and everything just works."
4,The Morpheus Connection!,"What happened to the review that I e-mailed to you on 02/10/2000? I thought a review would be put on within 5 days, but now it has been a month. Is it possible for you to respond?"
4,Collins Makes Poetry Fun,"Billy Collins has such a quirky sense of humor and he's a master of rhythm. I teach creative writing and, whenever a student thinks they don't like poetry, I pull out this collection and share a poem or two. Collins makes poetry accessible and enjoyable without dumbing it down. Yippee!"
4,Lots of talent here.....,"There is a reason they are the best studio musicians in the land.Peter Frampton was excellent - he can sing and he sure can play. Same for Travis Tritt and Vince Gill. For me Sean Colvin could have been omitted. I would rather have seen Bonnie Raitt or Sheryl Crow etc. Very nice DD-5.1 soundtrack - video is good but a cleaner video transfer would rate a ""5""...."
3,Nashville Players...,I was hoping this would feature Brent and Paul more trading licks but it was still very good. The tunes with Vince Gil and the ones of just the Players are the best.
1,donot buy this,"This is by far the worst grill I ever bought, it has hot and cool spots and is impossible to cook a decent egg, after 3 uses it started sticking, I bought this right before xmas and I threw it away today. 2 months old. its that bad."
1,Keep on Looking,"I bought this in the store without reading reviews, big mistake!! It does have a large cooking surface, however it does not heat evenly and does not cook anything very well. The non stick coating started coming off after the first washing. Very disapointed in this product will be investing in a new griddle very soon!"
1,Junk - find another option,"I just threw this thing in the garbage after 12 months, and wish I would have done so 11 months ago. ""Non-stick"" coating was peeling off which I am sure is not a healthy addition to your pancakes. Heating was very uneven, hot right under the perimeter and cool in the center.Made in China"
1,Faulty Control Unit.,"The first one lasted less than three months. The second one lasted about four months.The temperature control unit plugs into the griddle and is obvious of faulty design. The contact surfaces on the plug quickly become oxidized and impedes flow of electricity. If it had a functioning control, the griddle would be acceptable.Don't waste you money on this one."
1,"Worst design ever, exposed single coil heating element?!","I should haveknown far better than to buy from a company that is owned by Salton which is based now in South america and just floods the markets with cheap consumer goods such as this one. The heating is a complete joke, by the very design even heating is impossible. not even the crack team at Salton could chisle through the laws of thermodynamics. you get pancakes that are runny one one hemisphere and burned on the other and theres just no reason to cook on this toy. its also feather light and will easily be knocked off a counter spilling hot grease everywhere. I emailed thm and said i was throwing mine in the garbage afer they offerred a replacement Id have to mail them. HA! yeah send me another useless item, Im buying a Kalorik now, 1400 watts with enclosed heating element. Gota spend some $ for these types of toys"
1,Uneven heat,"Large cooking area is nice but the uneven heat makes this griddle almost unusable. Very easy to burn pancakes and, when they aren't burning, they're heated unevenly."
1,Worth less than that . . . .,"I recently received one of these as a gift and gave it a drive around the block for Christmas breakfast. The temperature control does not work. It has two functions - always on & burning stuff or OFF. This is a distinct fire hazard.This and all other Black and Decker products are no longer made by Black and Decker but by some company called Applica. Attempts to contact them were time consuming and frustrating, involving multiple codes and long wait times. I decided to contact the Federal Trade Commission about the faulty product instead."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I thought this would be great for our family of 5 on pancake night, but boy was I wrong! It heats unevenly, chars some pancakes while barely toasting others. Everything sticks to it, making it a total nightmare. I never should have purchased this before checking out the reviews. Ugh! Shame on you Black & Decker."
5,great start,This dvd is a great start for anyone. She runs through all the poses in basic move and some will be shown in a harder version as it progress's. This is a great stretching dvd. People looking for a fast pace should try something else. You will not sweat much here after you get used to this dvd. I love this dvd and all the others from this series. You will learn the basics of terminology and poses. Great dvd!
2,Origami No. 1,"The first book in a series of sixteen by Atsuke Nakata contained a few models that I have always enjoyed teaching children. These models are the cicada and the jewel box. Personally, I do not enjoy making houses or furniture such as an organ and bench which are also featured in this book. The book also contains a model for a hat, two different fish, a boat, and a simple purse."
1,I wish I could give this book 0 stars. It doesn't even deserve 1.,The only thing this book is good for is to set your drink on when working on your car. The instructions are not only confusing. In many cases they are just wrong.
2,Next time I will try a Haynes.,"This is my second Chilton manual and both times I have found them to be basically incomplete. They miss key steps, the photos and the text use different terminology for parts so they are confusing, and the photos are of poor quality. Sometimes when there is a section for installing or dismantling something it simply says install or remove or dismantle with no specific steps. I usually go to forums or watch youtube videos and actually have not even used this for my recent repairs as it was very uninformative. I guess next time I will try a Haynes manual."
1,terrible quality control,"I received this pan an hour ago, and it's going right back. The bottom is convex, the pan is very light (nowhere near the 4 lbs listed in the specifications), and the rim is completely tarnished. With all the praise for All-Clad, I can't believe the quality of this pan is this bad. Total garbage."
3,"Cooks very well, but the handle is not comfortable.","The other reviews cover how well this All-Clad Stainless 12-Inch Fry Pan cooks. However, the handle is somewhat sharp and so are the edges of the pan. For those who don't have strong hands, you might want to try a pan with a more rounded design."
5,All-Clad Stainless 12-Inch Fry Pan Rocks,This is an awesome skillet. No one should be without! It's a fantastic size and the quality can't be beat. I have other all clad pieces and some caphalon also. You really do get what you pay for. Highly recommend this!
1,A shocking experience,"This pan was a BIG disappointment for me. Items kept sticking, and I got tired mighty fast of using Barkeeper's friend every time I used it. The biggest problem, though, was it shocked me every time I used it! At first, I thought it was my imagination. Imagine my surprise when one day it shocked me so hard a large blister developed on my thumb! It WASN'T my imagination. Maybe it was due to the magnetic surface, I have no idea. BUT, none of my other stainless steel pots and pans (cheap ones) did this to me! And they all have metal handles. Go figure. I sold all my pieces of this line on eBay and am now trying Calphalon, which seems to work great (so far.)"
5,expensive but good,"I waited a long time to invest in all clad, primarily because its so expensive. However, this pan is worth every penny. Easy to clean and heats up quickly for a fast stir fry or a one pot meal. Definitely a kitchen staple."
5,Great pan!,Got this for hubby as a gift -- he can't stop raving about it! He cooks us dinner in it practically every night and then lovingly hand-washes it. Must be really terrific!
5,Outstanding!,I'm glad I made this purchase. It is a great pan to own especially if you aren't cooking a big meal. Amazon is the only place I could find this pan! I own alot of All-Clad pots and pans and I love this one!
1,Poor Quality,Very excited to fine these for my granddaughter. I saw this every Sunday Morning when I was a child and really looked forward to giving her these for her.. Verty blurred and not cleared.. I should of looked on Netflex.
5,Viking 128MB SDRAM DIMM,"used the ram-finder and priced 128MB dimms at a number of different sites. wanted name-brand ram, amazon had the best price, this viking product fit the bill. shipped almost immediately, was a snap to install, and our little emachine is now humming along with a healthier dose of memory.everything runs smoother and faster now that we've got 160mb instead of 32 mb of ram. this basically extends the useful life of our 366mzh machine for a little while longer."
4,Devrom,"These pills seem to work for what they say. I noticed no smell after using the product. I will warn, however, that they can turn your stools darker than they might normally appear. If this happens to you, I would stop for a few days (three) just to make sure that it's actually the pills causing it and not an upper GI bleed. If it is the pills, you can keep taking them. I haven't experienced any other side effects."
4,Devrom,This product is a wonderful addition to our vitamin regimen. We will continue to use it faithfully. The cost was the lowest that we found online.
1,They do nothing for me,Apparently they work for some people but not others. Too bad I had to pay $20 to find out they do nothing for me.
5,Pets Too,"Our 7 yr old Wheaton Terrier suffers from gas and bad breath, no matter what food we try. A friend recommended we try Devrom and after I checked it out, (vet supply stores also carry it) I have to say, amazing. We no longer have to leave the room when our dog smiles in his sleep. You can try to crush the tablet, but he takes it easily when hidden in his food."
5,Great buy,So far I think they this is a great product to have in every family. I will buy again soon.
5,All-CLad Stainless 12-inch fry pan lid,"This was a partial gift for my Granddaughter, she is really into All-Clad products, every Christmas she requests these products."
4,13 Fatal But Common Errors,Managers in our organization were assigned one of the errors and then were asked to review at a staff meeting with the other managers including how they would plan to apply the correction of the error in managing their own divisions. Is a quick read and an easy-to- understand book for any manager wishing to quickly and easily improve the basics and the way their managers manage. I recommend it!
5,A roller coaster of comedy and drama!,Even tho it's only13 episodes with what time they had it gave us the emotion and fun we need for a story about the afterlife and passing on without regrets. I believe it could have added more to the story save for another season but for what it's worth I take it at it's surface without the extra depth the characters should have.I would Recommend it to anyone and will say it's good to get you at the end. (just enough sappyness)Commit yourself to it straight thru if you want to get the emotion otherwise it may seem more ho hum.
5,Keeps you young,"I have worked out to this video since 1985. I have most often used the first 30 minutes of stretching and aerobic dance when I can't get outdoors to jog or bike. The rest of the tape is still amazing, obviously more challenging for me now, but it was good in my 30s and still feels worthwhile in my 50s. It is definitely my favorite workout video ever."
2,Negai,"The timer came undamaged and delivery was very fast. It looks like in the picture, except the sand is white!! I didn't expected work of art for this money, but at least accurate picture would be nice. I could have live with orange but white, come on, have they run out of dye all of the sudden? The red sand was the most climatic thing in this, kind off disappointing:("
5,"Fun, easy to learn grammar book. Great!",My kids like all the pop-up which are well done. Our second grade teacher borrowed it...it came back with a few of the pop-ups destroyed but I'm buying a second copy. It is easy to really understand the grammar concepts after going through the book. It was a good way for an adult to learn too--just in case you want to know about prepositions or adverbs or other long forgotten concepts.
3,Bugs in Software,"After reading several reviews of the Euro version, I decided to purchase the US version when it came out. Compared it against the similar featured: Garmin Quest (smaller screen), Magellan Roadmate 300 (no battery), and the Tom Tom Go (more expensive). Have found the satellite acquistion is excellent and the displayed map good. Mine has a minor hardware glitch in that the volume wheel does not work. My major complaint is the software (SmartST Version 3.0) which I consider full of bugs. Often the voice prompts & map visual directions are at odds with each other; attempting to program off a City's Zone (must be the Euro Zip code?) is worthless & confusing so should be deleted from US edition software; unit periodically just freezes & locks up which requires a reboot to clear. Otherwise, once Navman fixes the software this will be a sweet little unit."
2,Interference makes it unusable,"The product had great reviews on the iPod discussion sites, but for me, it picked up noise interference from my car's engine. As I accelerated, it generated a higher pitched noise. It was bad enough that I couldn't use it. If I plugged my iPod into my stereo without the Flexdock, there was no interference - so I know if was the flexdock.The other problem might depend on car. The Flexdock also charges the iPod. In my car (GM), the unit charges even when the car is turned off. Not good since it could drain the battery."
4,Spong in Summary Form,"This CD contains two 2003 interviews on Canada's CBC radio network featuring retired American Episcopalian bishop John Shelby Spong. In summary form, he outlines some thoughts on topics like the Sept 11 attacks, prayer, cosmology, Bible literalism and the rise of fundamentalist religion, and he questions our traditional understanding of many Bible-related issues in the light of new knowledge. It is tempting for conservative Christians to dismiss this man's ideas out-of-hand ... but we should not. One of the best things I ever did was pick up one of his books for the first time. If you've not given intelligent consideration to Spong's ideas before, this CD could be a good start for you. Then you'll want to get his books!"
1,The product I purchased it is not stainless.,"I purchased this product at a ""bricks & mortar"" retailer, and discovered that it is not magnetic, i.e., a magnet will not adhere to it, nor will it work on an induction range. The product was sold as stainless, and had the word ""stainless"" stamped on the bottom.The retailer accepted it back without question. At the time I returned it, I checked several other identical units at the retailer with a magnet, and none of them were magnetic, so this was not an isolated occurrence. How can a reputable manufacturer such as All-Clad portray a product as being of a specific material when it is not?"
4,"very good introduction to computer users, but network novices","This book introduces basic network concepts, such as network protocols, routing and network architecture, in a pleasant and understandable way. If you are wondering how ethernet rolls into IP and TCP, how MAC addresses map to IP addresses is being made, what subnet masks are and how they are used by routers, you will find the answers in this book.It is targeted to people who are familiar with computers, but novices of computer networks."
3,Very Erudite,"One should be able to walk away with a Master's Degree after finishing this book. Actually, it ought to be part of the New York State education system.....yeah, like that will ever happen! At least I suggest that History majors in college read it, anyone interested in New York history read it and anyone living in New York read it......Well done, indeed."
4,Facinating look into early American history...,"I didn't read this book, I listened to the audio version. Unless you like reading long non-fiction, I would suggest treating yourself to the audio version.It's a great account of the early Dutch colonies in New Netherland (present day New York). Along the way, you'll meet facinating characters and realize that nothing has changed much.Having never been to New York before, this book has inspired me to plan a trip."
4,Makes me feel proud,"To an extend, I agree with the critique that has been brought forward here. There are indeed quite a number of sentences stating with 'We can image that...' or 'Supposing...' and the character of Van der Donck is being a bit over glorified, while others stay a bit shallow. As a reader of the (very good) Dutch translation, I must say that I besides these, I found it a very entertaining read. There is indeed something to say for the more laissez fair and multicultural attitude that was sowed during the first years of settlement and as a Dutchman, I can relate to the characters in the book to a large extend. Some of then act indeed real Dutch. There are many, mostly funny facts presented in the book that I was not aware of and the wider global context in which the story is placed puts it in a nice perspective."
3,"Great content, lousy binding","I won't rehash the storyline because the other reviewers have given a good description of that. If I were to rate the book solely on content, I would give it five stars.Unfortunately, the binding disintegrated halfway through the first reading, and I'm gentle with books. The cheap binding loses the book two stars."
4,New Amsterdam Rediscovered,"As a well written and well researched history of the Dutch settlement of New York, Island at the Center of the World , is a hugely entertaining and enlightening read. While illuminating this less well known chapter in early American history Russell Shorto has also provided character sketches of many of the early Dutch settlers including the better known such as Peter Stuyvesant and Peter Minuet as well as scores of others who are less well remembered but also left their impact on the culture but as interestingly left their names on a variety of streets, boroughs and other fixtures of the New York area.Shorto explains why the Dutch influence in the Americas is less understood and studied than both the English and Spanish today but had a significant influence on American society that is typically overlooked.All in all , this is very good popular history and a very readable page turner on an interesting subject."
5,This isn't so much music...it's drama...perfectly cast.,"""Chalkmark"" is certainly among the most underappreciated of Joni's works. The fact that so many fellow artists were a part of this piece should be proof positive that Joni is a musical force to be associated with, and reckoned with. From ""My Secret Place"", a lilting but vibrant ballad, perfect for those of us who believe in soul mates, to ""Cool Water"", which gave me my first opportunity to tolerate Willie Nelson (great song!), to the BRILLIANT ""Beat of Black Wings"", this is a major piece, the type of work that, 100 years from now, college students will be analyzing for its complex content. ""The Reoccuring Dream"" is a song that no other artist could make credible, ""Snakes and Ladders"" is a movie of the week encapsulated in a great tune, and ""Dancing Clown"" is just, plainly, a trip. Buy this. Listen to it. eMail if you think I've let you down."
2,Skunk at the Picnic,"I dug this CD out of my collection yesterday, put it on, and started working on the computer with ""Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm"" playing. The opening duet with Peter Gabriel was pleasant enough, but by the time I heard ""Lakota"" chanted over and over, I realized this CD was both dated and discordant. As I tried to sit through a duet of Billy Idol and Ms. Mitchell, I wondered what twisted muse had inspired one of my favorite singer/songwriters on this less than stellar recording.There are some bright moments here and there, but Ms. Mitchell's better works do not, in my opinion, include this album. I see from reading some of the other reviews that I am apparently ""ignorant"" or worse, and I'm sure that I'll soon have as many negative votes as a porcupine has quills for daring to state a qualified assessment of an icon's work.Guess, I'm the skunk at the picnic on this one."
2,No Paper,"The calculator itself looks great and it arrived quickly. However, there was no paper for the calculator.I called Amazon as I have always before found them to be very customer friendly. All I wanted was for them to send some printing paper for the calculator. They refused. They said that I would have to return the calculator and when they got it back, they would send me a new one. I told them that I didn't want to bother with all that ...I just wanted them to send me some paper. Again they refused. Apparently I have to waste an inordinate amount of my time plus costs for UPS pick up and delivery so that Amazon could save a couple of bucks on the paper that they should have sent in the first place."
4,Not same as what is pictured.,"I wanted my new machine to be the same as what I had been using. The picture shown is exactly what I wanted, but when it arrived it was not what I expected. I believe this is the newer model. There isn't a triple zero button and some the other buttons are either not available or in a different position. It is a good machine and does have what I need so I decided to keep it anyway. Just disappointed that I didn't get what was advertised."
4,Second pair,"This was the second pair that I purchased. The earth brown tends to run a little bit larger than the camel khaki that I purchased, but is still quite comfortable to wear. Definitely a good buy as I got them at a great discount. The camel khaki were a perfect fit, and were so comfortable that I was able to were them an entire day the first time without any discomfort."
5,Got rid of Bronchitis!,"I'm not sure if it's the garlic, mushrooms, astragalus, or a synergistic combination at work, but this is an awesome product that killed off acute bronchitis in both my wife and myself. It's one supplement I will no longer go without!"
4,Not Cheap,"Not cheap, but it's a high quality product. Solid, rugged, and very good at providing even heat distribution. I'm very happy with it's performance over uses ranging from roasts to lasagna."
3,Make sure you know your size,I had the exact opposite of the last guy. I needed this lid but bought the 10 inch first. The 10 1/2 inch is what I needed for my stock pots. If you are not sure give All-Clad a call.
3,More of the same,"I bought this CD because it includes 'The Portrait,' a piano solo featured in the film but not on the first soundtrack. 'Titanic Suite' includes bits of all the major musical themes from the original soundtrack. I enjoyed 'Nearer my God to Thee'. 'My Heart Will Go On' includes dialouge from the film.Get it if you're a classical music, Titanic, or Titanic-period buff. Otherwise, skip it."
2,TOO MUCH TITANIC!!!,"I am getting tired about TITANIC.. I have the first and second CD, but the Second CD doesn't live up to the TITANIC HYPE. The first soundtrack was pretty good, but the second Soundtrack is UNBEARIBLE!!!"
4,"Good, but should have been part of the original sountrack","This album contains the remainder of James Horner's score from the picture, which masterfully reinforces the movie. As with the original soundtrack, it brings back the movie's memorable scenes from the joys of the voyage to the horrors and tragedies of the sinking.However, there was clearly not enough leftover material for a complete CD-length work, so some non-movie tracks were added. Although consistent in theme with the actual soundtrack compositions, they still feel a little out-of-place.A much better approach would have been to package the original soundtrack as a double-CD, a la ""Saturday Night Fever"", et. al., and include the material from this album, free of the distracting dialogue clips that were overdubbed on this album.Nonetheless, there is enough here to warrant it's purchase."
4,This IS the Titanic Soundtrack!,"This is the soundtrack that should have been released with the original as a two-CD set. While the first CD was beautiful, this one represents all the diversity of class on board that ship. There are a few tracks I could have done without: ""Titanic Suite"" is just a rerun from the first CD. It could have been left off if these had been released as a set. I also didn't see the reason for having a second ""Nearer My God to Thee."" The I Salonisti rendition was perfect and should have stood alone. ""Come Josephine"" was so haunting with Maire Brennan's vocals. My favorite track from the CD? It would have to be ""Jack Dawson's Luck."" If you were disappointed by the original soundtrack, don't let that keep you from buying this one. It is excellent!"
2,Some nice Horner stuff in a manipulative mess,"This CD is primarily for people who don't mind cynically shameless emotional manipulation and for the Titanic-soundtrack-cry-party crowd. A good deal of very nice (if derivative of itself) Horner work (Titanic Suite, Epilogue, Portrait, A Building Panic) and some completely gratuitous and unnecesssary dialogue clips from the film ruining music that was far more powerful in the original sountrack where it was allowed to stand on its own. And what can I say of the butchery of ""Come Josephine in my Flying Machine""? A lighthearted, happy 1910 popular song turned into a funeral dirge?It's too bad that Horner and the executives at Sony Classical couldn't leave well enough alone and just give us an exceptionally good example of what a film soundtrack can be; and that they didn't have enough confidence in what they had to let it stand on its own merits, rather than cheapening it with sledghammer, ersatz ""emotion."""
3,Okay for confirm your common sense,"I bought this book thinking it would really explain how to plan a software release which may not have been a good goal. It does a decent job explaining the role of PM in general, groups you interact with, things to look out for but nothing specificly actionable.Still looking for such a book. I've heard the Agile series does a better job at giving examples of documents and planning methodology."
3,Only for Beginners,"Unfortunately I cannot bring myself to rate any published book with as many grammatical errors as this one higher than a 3. Once you get past what appears to be a piratically unedited book, the content is good for someone with little knowledge of what an actual Product Manager does.If you have any type of IT Project Management or IT Management experience you may want to try a different book or you may feel you wasted your money."
2,Killer Herring?,"If you want facts about herring look no further. If you were silly enought to buy ""Realm of the Killer Whales"" To learn about orcas you will be very disappointed. Id say 85% of this over priced pile of DVD was about the plight, breeding, and harvesting of herring. They talk about alot of animals that have nothing to do with the killer whales outside of living in the ocean.Most of the killer whale scenes are above the water. The only thing that saved this dvd is the last 5 or 6 minutes showing killer whales under the water engaging in the unusual behavior of rubbing the bodies along a pebble beach. That was pretty cool. No hunting, no up close, no shark cage perspective. I didnt even see an ivory orca tooth from begining to end. I havent watched the Sperm whale documentary. However when I do I expect to learn alot about the life cycle of freekin tunas or something. I GOT ROBBED."
4,Classic,first of all I am a vateran at this game i have been playing it ever since i was old enough to use a computer.Good things-this is good if you want to find exactly where the new dooms came from-it is one of the first FPS games ever-you want to see what your precious halo games came from here it isBad things-if your looking for up to date cutting edge technology and graphics this isnt your game- the graphics are pretty bad as you can see from the picture but you have to think this was top of the line a long time agooverall if you like games that arent up to date but you just like them anyways than this is right for you
1,garbage,Total garbage. Doesn't tell you anything you can't find on the net. Don't even waste your money.
2,Dissenting opinion,"I bought this album based on the reviews AND because I LOVE Kitaro.The first time I listened to it, I thought I had put on the wrong CD. Track #1, ""Mysterious Encounter,"" scared my cat!Where is that lovely dreamlike quality that really DOES transport me? This sounded like bad movie sound track music: over-orchestrated, overblown and discordant. I was very disappointed."
5,A must have,I am a senior Chemical Engineering student. This book provided more than enough review for me to fly through the exam. It was the best investment that I have ever made.
3,Need to be updated,I used this book to take my FE exam but I was disappointed because the sample questions in this book is so outdated. Although it does help me to understand the concept of the topic and I like the way the author give an outline of each topic but I wish that the book will be updated according to the new exam topics' outline.
5,Great Study Manual,This manual provides you with the basic concepts you will need to succeed on the FE.
5,Beautiful Baseball Book!,Andy is thinking he is too small for baseball. Maybe he should quit...but a turn of events make this book a homerun! Good anchor text for mini lesson on predicting. Great message for students to never give up!
3,Not what I expected,Although this book is not what I expected - it might be exactly what you are looking for.It is a very simple book illustrated with photographs of children of different cultures and some jail pictures. It explains what jail is and how one has to do bad things to get there. It also touches on feelings and changes in the family. Every topic is touched all too briefly.
3,"Good, but nothing to really write home about.","I can't help but feel that ""Skylarking"" is an overrated, though still quality, album. ""Dear God"" is one of the two greatest songs this band has ever written, along with ""The Mayor of Simpleton"", and even if it wasn't a great song should have been given plaudits just for terminally annoying so many right-wing Christian fundamentalist supremacists. (The song was one of those targeted by the PMRC in their music censorship drives in the late 80s and early 90s). ""Earn Enough For Us"" is also excellent. The rest of the album, though....I don't know. I mean it's not BAD or anything, it's just kind of....there. It's pleasant alternative background music, at least to me, anyway, but nothing really stands out about it. I definitely think that, even with all of its filler, ""Oranges and Lemons"" is a superior album. ""Skylarking"" is still a must for XTC fans, though, and recommended for fans of this genre of music"
1,Annoying,Only die-hard fans could like this mess. I remember everyone was so impressed when it first came out and I bought it. In 2001 it just comes off as annoying and pointless. There's nothing Beatle-esque about it.
5,"Bliss, pure bliss! ! !","Musically complex, lyrically entwined, infectious grooves of the most pleasant kind."
5,Please forgive me,Please forgive me. I first listened to this album during the yellow clouded haze of college all-nighters and was frankley bored to tears. That was 20 years ago. I didn't listen to it again for almost 18 years when for some inexplicable reason I bought it on cd.It grabbed me by the throat and hasn't let go. I had always known PM as a fantasticly creative soloist. But the solo on 'Third Wind' caused me to spew coffee through my nostrils on my morning drive to work.Please forgive me for my 18 years of ignorance.
3,Frankly there's a whiff of mall music here,"I love most of Pat's music, but this album and perhaps to a lesser degree ,The Road to You, are too 'pop' and tinged with an air of mediocrity, at least to my taste. First Circle, Letter from Home,Secret Story, and Imaginary day among many others, have none of that feeling. Bright Size Life, now that's a beautiful classic."
5,A longer Dora adventure,"My 4 year old son and 6 year old daughter both loved this dora movie. It was not your ""basic"" dora so it kept their interest much easier. Includes basic Spanish vocabulary skills. Good for younger ages as well."
5,Dora saves the Snow Princess,"From the second my granddaughter got this DVD, she hasn't stopped watching it. She loves it. Well worth the money and well worth getting for all Dora fans."
2,"Can't imagine why this was chosen as a ""TODAY SHOW"" book choice",So incredibly boring. The story went nowhere slowly. I could not stand the selfish and often cruel main character (although there was certainly tenderness toward her aunt). Issac had many good qualities but the story itself just dragged on and on.Would not recommend.
4,"What,'s not to like?","Having read almost all of his books, it's amazing how anyone could still come up with so many good plots."
4,A lid's a lid,"I'm not sure what you can say about a frying pan lid. I'm also not sure how you can justify the price for this one. Nevertheless, it is a nice hunk of stainless steel, heavy, appears sturdy, and does the job.A few have complained about the fit. It is a little loose, but I'm not sure that the loose fit interferes w/ function at all. The lid is heavy and stays in place. I also have a Cuisinart Green Gourmet 12 in non-stick skillet (a very nice non-stick skillet, by the way) that this lid fits well too. Good for me because Cuisinart doesn't make a lid for their skillet. Two for the price of one.I'm happy w/ the purchase because I needed a lid for both pans and I got it. I'm not sure that a tighter fit would have made it any better, but a tighter fit may have prevented me from using it on both pans. Every cloud has a polished stainless steel lining.I gave it 4, not 5 stars initially for the high price. In retrospect, maybe 5 stars is fair but Amazon won't let me change it. It's a good lid."
4,pricey but does the job,"Finally gave up trying to make my other lids work for my 12"" All-Clad fry pan. Had debated about getting this cover a while back but found it too pricey. It's still too pricey, but it fits, its sturdy and lovely, too."
3,So so,"This does not fit snugly and it is made in china. That being said, it fits as snugly as my all clad Dutch oven that came with a lid so if you need a lid for an all clad fry pan this may be as good as it gets."
2,"Good, but probably overpriced","Potential buyers should be aware of a couple things:1. Most of All-Clad's lids and other accessories (things other than pots and pans) are made in China and aren't actually ""clad,"" the 3-layer bonded metal that is characteristic of the company's U.S. made cookware. Nobody needs a bonded metal lid, you aren't cooking on it. This info is from their website.2. You can get way cheaper lids. For example, the Calphalon ""everyday pan with lid"" often goes on sale on Amazon for about two dollars more than just this lid costs. That lid fits this pan like it was made for it, and is also domed so you get more space inside. Plus you have an extra pan.My advice is get a cheaper lid made by another company, or buy an all-clad skillet with this lid included when its on sale for 80-100 dollars which happens from time to time."
1,"Loose, sloppy fit. I am not happy with the purchase...","I recently purchased an All Clad 12 inch skillet and lid. My pan and lid have approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch of play between the edges of the skillet and lid. I would expect this from a cheap set of pots and pans, but not from All Clad. A few of the other reviewers have also mentioned issues regarding the fit.I have an 8 inch All Clad skillet and lid and those two fit perfectly. It appears there may be a production/quality problem with the 12 inch lid. I am not happy with the purchase."
5,Anatomy Made Painlessly Simple!,"As a physician who labored through Gross Anatomy, I can greatly appreciate the delightfully simple, and yet comprehensive, multi-modal approach this DVD set takes in instructing us in the marvelous workings of our musculoskeletal system. I am lucky enough to be a patient of Clint Chandler's. His broad and holistic understanding of these musculoskeletal issues is the most thorough I have ever experienced, superior to that of any Orthopedic surgeon I have known. Fortunately for his patients, this understanding is conveyed during his sessions in clear, concise and logical explanations that accompany his body work. Now, any student of anatomy, massage therapy, physical therapy (or any other body work discipline) can enjoy the same easy teaching style with these DVDs. If a picture is worth a thousand words, these DVDs certainly are worth a few million!"
3,LATE IN LIFE...,"Wow!!!I started watching George Burns and Gracie Allen Showlate in life. Since I got rid of cable, I happened to catchthem on antenna tv; and not knowing how long they would be on thereI purchased the dvd. The first episode and the last episode are washed out.The film is so white that I cant make out the charaters, but the episodes inbetween are ok for watching. I'm not sorry especially for the price I paid."
5,"Brutal, melodic, perfectly executed.","This is the kind of cd which you can listen to while you drive fullspeed on a highway!!!Very brutal, melodic, perfectly executed tunes, this is a melodic death metal masterpiece.. Everyone, Hail Norther!!!"
4,packaging needs work,"We just received this yesterday, it seems to cool down quickly & that part works. Today, it was covered in frost inside (I know it is not frost free but that was too much frost) I noticed the was a dent in the corner of the door that prevented an air tight seal. I repaired the dent & it looks like it will be air tight. Will see tomorrow. Otherwise, I think it will work great for the boat. My wife adds: That is the cutest little ice cube tray I have ever seen' - little being the operative word, it might make enough ice for one drink. Although, there is room for additional real size trays."
5,Needed for laboratory supplies,This freezer is exactly what we needed to fit into our Cubex to store our laboratory supplies that needed to be frozen. It is a great size to fit into a small space and provides the cooling power we needed.
2,Mediocre,"I found these recordings to be quite unrefined. Some nice moments, yes, but, then quickly ruined by passages of ugly sound, bad intonation and clumsy phrasing. Many of the dynamics Fauré wrote into the score are simply ignored. Sometimes the balance between the instruments is outright bizarre (especially between the piano and strings). It's a shame, since having all of Faure's chamber music in one set is very convenient."
2,Wrong product sent...wrong book,"Book ordered (Maple Syrup cookbook) was as pictured with a red barn, copyright date 1954, updated 1989 & 2001. Book sent (Maple Syrup cookbook) front cover picture is kitchen table setting, copyright 1989. We have been given an account credit for the error. I offered to return it, but the sender never responded."
4,Classic Songs Hold Up Over Time,"This is an excellent remastering of the group's best songs. The quality is very good; don't bother with the original recordings as this sounds much better.The songs still hold up and don't sound dated. So sit back, relax, and take a ride with Berlin on the Metro, never mind the soldier sleeping next to you!"
4,a good overall CD,"I love the song, ""Take my breath away"",I first heard it on the movie Top Gun. It is a beautiful song and it really makes you think. The other songs are pretty good but none can compare with Take My Breath Away."
5,A band reunited,I had totally forgotten about this band until I saw them on Band Reunited on VH-1. Good stuff. The Metro and Take My Breath Away are classic songs.
3,"Berlin suffers from ""Simple Minds Syndrome""","I love Berlin's early material! As a fan of New Wave, I enjoy ""The Metro"", ""Sex (I'm A...)"", ""No More Words"", and, most of all, the masterpiece that is ""Masquerade"".But then! The band gradually morphs from a terrific New Wave outfit into some sort of corporate arena-rock clone. And their songs slowly begin sounding like Heart tunes (and that is NOT a compliment, believe me).By 1986's ""Top Gun"" soundtrack, and the horrid ""Take My Breath Away"", the metamorphosis is in full swing.If you are like me, you'll want to order Berlin's first two albums (""Information"" and ""Pleasure Victim""), and skip the rest (including this greatest hits package). Even ""Masquerade"" isn't worth owning an album that contains dreck like ""Blowin' Sky High"" and ""For All Tomorrow's Lies""."
4,This is still good stuff,"I loved Berlin when they first came out back in the early '80s. I remember first seeing them on a show called MV3, hosted by Richard Blade from the L.A. radio station KROQ (back when KROQ was worth listening to). I fell in love with ""The Metro"" and with a song that I wish were on this Best-Of collection: ""Pleasure Victim.""Well, after all these years, I still like these songs. I just saw Berlin tonight on the ""Happy Hour"" show on VH-1. Terri Nunn still looks fantastic, and sounds even better. The last song that they sung on the show was ""Take My Breath Away,"" which is still a great slow ballad.Some of the other songs might not quite measure up to the more well-known ones, but nevertheless they are enjoyable and a lot better than most recent releases from '90s bands."
2,Disappointed :(,Like another novela I bought(CCEA)I thought just maybe this one would be different. But again I was cheated because its not the full novela. There are chunks of the storyline missing. If dont watch closely you'll be like what the hell just happened.. so dont blink lol you will miss alot...your better off watching this in its entireity on you tube or something.
2,OK but...,"After considering a number of networking options, I decided to try powerline to connect the network in our basement to the network on our second floor. I read the reviews on Amazon as well as on .........com and ........... There was not much information in the newsgroups which I felt was a little worrisome. Our house is about 3 years old, so the wiring should be sound. Thus far, my experience has been that I get full connection between some outlets, and none between others. There is no obvious reason for this - some plugs next to each other don't work, while others across the house do. Some rooms have lots of things plugged in while others have none. Needless to add, the two outlets I wanted to connect were two of the ones that don't work. Oh well..."
1,Not compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7,"If you have a modern Windows operating system, this product will not work. Support will tell you that you can configure it on an XP or earlier OS, then swap the network cable to another PC to get it to work, but this is not accurate.The Linksys (Cisco actually) site does not have any published documentation or driver downloads available for this product. If you're looking to use this with Vista or Windows 7 computer, you're out of luck."
1,mistaken identity,"Product delivered was not the same as pictured in the ad. It was the same model number but the newer version and I neeeded the pictured older version. Seller was very quick to accept the return and offer a refund.Even though I didn't get the exact item I wanted , Quick Video honorably handled the transcation."
2,What a disappointment!,[....] I am currently wrapped up in the Diana Gabaldon series which is set in Scotland. I want to know how to say the Gaelic words used in the books. I majored in foreign languages and never had a dictionary that didn't include pronunciation. I returned the dictionary immediately (along with the Irish dictionary which was equally lacking).
3,useful,"If you are looking for an inexpensive gaelic-english-gaelic dictionary to use as a complement to the Teach yourself GAelic course, this is probably your best bet. A wonderful little book for beginners, though eventually you will want to get Dwelly's Gaelic-English, Thomson's English-Gaelic, and probably MacLellan's two-way as well if you continue with the language. However, these are an investment, especially if you get all three, so this one is best for starters. And because it gives the cases forms of the nouns, it will remain useful even when you are developing fluency."
3,No pronunciation guide,"A bit disappointing as it doesn't have a pronunciation guide, but it's neat to see and figure out what everything is in Scots-Gaelic."
5,Levy gave words to my feelings; sense to my 'orphaned' life,"I thought ""orphaned adult"" was my phrase and my unique emotional state following the deaths of both of my parents within a year--and at 56, I was uncomfortable with the depth of my grief and feeling of child-like despair at their absences. It was consumming without visible end. Levy gives words to those feelings and context to that grief and child-like despair, whatever your age. And he shines a light that is true in his eiplogue--there WILL be a day when you awake and (she) is not the first thing you think of . . . when you go about your business and it is an hour, three hours . . before something brings her to mind. You don't forget, but you start living your life again in memory and love. I cannot recommend this book enough ..........."
3,Game Boy Advance Holder,"A It is a nice vinyl statue with a place to snap ... your GBA for storage (instead of laying it on the table) thus can help to prevent scratching. It also has slots for holding/storing two game cartriges. Overall an esoteric item, but good looking, functional and durable. It will be a rare and desirable collectible item in the future. ... Hang on to yours."
3,One of the best Live-CDs I have,"This Live CD I like best from Men At Work, because of its good live feeling. It's noticable live, and you hear like they work hard to give their best. Therefore I like it more than any studio-Greatest. I think, the loss of studio perfection is more than compensated by the capturing live feeling. And it contains allmost all of my favourite songs. On this CD, men at work really impressed me. A small pity is, that there was a lineup change of the band members before this concert, so you might not find your favourite lineup here. But for me this is not a problem here. This CD is still very enjoyable and delivers a perfectly positive Live feeling. Great."
2,Aerosmith turns into Bon Jovi,"I was a big Aero fan in the 70s but this was the last Aerosmith album I bought. The ballad ""Angel"" is like any other 80s hair band power ballad...pure sap. Some of the others tunes aren't bad but they certainly can't compete with their mid seventies hey day. I agree with the reveiwer who said the music is overproduced. The most interestong track is the Zeppelin styled ""The Movie""."
5,THE Best Edie Album ever.,"This is THE best Edie Brickell album. Just listen to the first 3 tracks and you'll be hooked. They're all just as good as the next. If you don't own an Edie album and are thinking about purchasing one, this is a really good place to start. Ghost of a Dog comes in a close second."
4,One word: solid!,"The boyz from Columbia have done it again. Thematically similar to Fairweather Johnson, Musical Chairs is nonetheless a better album. The band shows its varied style to a hilt on this album. ""What's Going on Here"" has a ""Tucker's Town""ish chorus and will be a hit single when released. The acoustic ""Michelle Post"" recalls the Rucker/Bryan cover of Tom Waits's ""Closing Time"". Would have given album five stars except for the limp ""Desert Mountain Showdown"" and ""What Do You Want From Me Now."" Overall though, a great album with catchy melodies you will be humming in no time."
3,don't get this,"sure this looks good but really it isn't. the child lock doesn't work and the batteries run out way too fast.it does not go 500 yards , it goes to about 250 yards. this is a total RIPOFF i suggest you try another selection."
1,it's to heavy,"to heavy and the pedals bumpity bump bump.if you buy it, don't move. It's a pain in the hiney."
4,decent item,"Overall this is a decent unit for the price, It has a very small footprint and it does creat a decent workout. The multiple programs available and the user defined programs are great as well. The only problems I see with it are that the heart rate monitor does not work very well and thte stride is small. otherwise it is well worth the price."
2,Only good if you don't care how far you've gone,"The elliptical I received was not the one in the picture. The screen was completely different. The setup was pretty easy. When I started to use it, the speed and distance stayed at zero even though I was on it for a good few minutes. I tried to find some answers in the owner's manual, but all I found was a few workouts and nutritional facts. I emailed the company, and I am now waiting for a response. Besides the screen not working properly, it's a pretty good machine. It's not like the ones at the gym at all, but that's why you pay so little for it."
1,We hate the sixth one too.,"We received this unit as a replacement for a recalled version made by the same company. Because we purchased the unit from Target in the first place, we were unable to take advantage of Amazon's full refund. These things must grow on trees in this factory because they never hesitate to send us a whole new unit when ours breaks down every 2-8 weeks. If you do buy this, buy it through Amazon, but don't think you're not going to be assembling and disassembling these things like it's your job."
4,Eclipse Elliptical 1100HRA,This is a great value for appx $300 which includes shipping. I am in pretty good shape and workout in the gym regularly. I feel that I get a harder workout on this machine then the elliptical I use at the gym. Even at the lowest level of resistance you will get a good sweat and burn lots of calories. Highly recommended.
5,Even for seasoned fitness buffs...,"Eventhough my husband and I have been working out for years, after travel or illnesses it is difficult to get back into the 'religion' of working out. I saw this book and decided to give it a try. To be honest, the Madona intro didn't attract me but the photos and the easy, straightforward style did. This book motivated us to restart and re-energize our tired workout regimen. We really liked the nutrition information which motivated us to eat like we are athletes...fueling ourselves for the long-haul!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to stay fit for a lifetime!"
5,Brilliant piece of work with a little bit of everything.,"This has got to be one of the best CDs I've heard in the last 5 years. I stumbled upon it, heard ""Prophecy"" a couple of times on the radio and now ""Villa Elaine"" is in my regular rotation.The songs are encompassing, soothing, and take you into a surreal little world. I recommend listening with no outside distractions so you can experience the full-bodied melodies completely.If you like this, I also recommend Jeff Buckley. I find the styles very similar. Finally, some good music!"
4,Brilliant,"This CD is absolutely amazing. I loved almost every song on it. Cinjun Tate's voice is tremendous and could probably make anything sound good. The only drawback for me is ""Goodbye Little World."" Shelby sounds like he's drunk when he's singing it and took crack before writing it. It's so weird, I can't explain it. All I can say is that when I first heard it, I laughed for almost 5 straight minutes. If THAT song wasn't on there, I'd give it 5 stars."
4,"Amazing, despite some problems","This is a great musical, and accordingly a great movie. I thought the cast as a whole was great, Steve Martin and Rick Moranis especially. The songs were all done extremely well (except for Somewhere that's Green, in my opinion. Just took too long). The songs Dentist and Skid Row were done particularly well.I was however, disappointed that the songs that were taken out, were taken out. Now (It's Just the Gas) and Mushnik and Son are my favorites from the show, and it's sad that they weren't included."
3,"Great music. Alas, the show is clearly anti-Semitic and shallowly anti-capitalist","The music's fabulous. Alas, the story is a very thinly veiled diatribe against capitalism. And of course, the evil character is conspicuously and unnecessarily Jewish--the classic cliche, a cheap Jewish business owner."
3,Broadway version is better!,"This is the '80s movie soundtrack. Rick Morannis is a very believable dorky Seymore, but lacks vocal talent. Ellen Green is very cute at sometimes, but when she belts, oh gosh cover your ears. You can tell that her voice isn't really like that fake accent and she tries a little too hard not to break out of it. Audrey 2 is a really good bass and I really like him. If you are looking for a good recording of Little Shop of Horrors (if you are like auditioning for a community theatre version, etc) buy the broadway version! But if you are a fan of the movie, this is for you."
4,great music! great fun!,"I just love this CD!! My high school just did this musical and I was Audrey, so it was lots of fun to listen to the songs after I had done them. I really like the music because it is so upbeat, never dragging in tempo. a must for anyone's collection!"
1,Its not worth your money,This watches battery doesn't last long. You'll have to replace the battery once every 3 months. I got this watch for 5 months and it broke down on me. Its too complicated to use.
3,HP backpack,"The person was realy lucky that I didn't return it because I really needed a backpack for school.Reasons why I would of retuned it was because the box was way too big, no reciept, and at first the bag didn't look like any thing like on the net. So, I deiced I'll to keep it and give it chance because it might be the way the light was hitting it and it was, because the light was making the bag darker than it looks So, becareful when you order this bag."
4,Handy dandy back pack,"I love the HP line of back packs. There is plenty of spaces for papers, binders, and of course a laptop. I normally carry cables and headphones in my bag as well."
2,low quality,"Had the bag 4 a short time and its already coming apart! It barely fits a 17"" laptop. I was dissapointed."
4,Fits 17.3 inch laptop!!,Finally a bag that holds my laptop in the computer pocket. The rest of the compartments are kind of small but this will fill in carry on no problem. Solid construction well see how it holds up but so far so good.
5,HP Backpack,"This is a fabulous and very comfortable backpack. In the picture, it appeared to have some purple hues, along with the green, but it was actually grey when we received it. This backpack is for my daughter, and although it doesn't look very feminine, she loves how sturdy it is. It is very well made and holds all of her college belongings, including her laptop."
3,Interesting and light read,I really struggled with the fact the key character made the choice to have an affair... it all works out in the end and the characters are ok and interesting insight into the fashion world... Fun light read.
4,Constant Stream of Energy,"Its been a while since I bought a salsa CD so when I saw this on the rack I decided to give it a shot. I am not very knowledgeable about Eddie Palmieri, but am familiar with work he's done with Cal Tjader and Tito Puente so I at least expected a decent album. I am not disappointed. El Rumbero del Piano sizzles from start to finish. My favorites are Cafe, a fabulous upbeat arrangement of the Mexican classic Malaguena Salerosa, Donde Esta Mi Negra, and La Llave. The only letdowns are the rather mundane and jejune lyrics which unfortunately inform much of the genre. But if you don't understand Spanish, so what? I give this four stars for the quality of the music with its constant stream of horn and piano-driven energy that just won't permit the listener to sit still."
3,"Sturdy, but impractical","In theory, it's a nice idea. It will only fit towels of the sort used in flea-bag motels: threadbare! I am using it for my bath mat and wash rags. None of my thick towels will fit. Maybe, after about 100 washings, they will..."
5,Customer Service,"YouRemodel has excellent customer service. I purchased the Chrome Hotel Towel Rack, but it wasn't deep enough to hold my towels. I had to return the item, and YouRemodel gave me a prompt refund. Their customer service is outstanding, and I would purchase products from this company again.Chrome Hotel Towel Rack - 3 Guest Size"
2,Lid doesn't fit skillet,"""Lid doesn't fit skillet"". I purchased this item with the All-Clad 7-1/2 skillet. The items arrived together, but the lid does not fit the pan. Instead of sitting on the rim of the skillet, it drops inside the pan about 1/4 inch. I don't know who in China is in charge of quality control, but in this country if we make a lid for a pan, it actually fits the pan."
2,Better than hoped!,"I purchased this watch for my husband who works with me in a dog grooming salon. The salon is in a very upscale neighborhood & even though he washes dogs all day, I wanted him to make a statement with his watch. It was even more beautiful than it looked online, and after a few months of constant wear,tear, exposure to water, and being banged around I have the following to report: Keeps perfect time, normal daily wear & exposure to light is enough to keep it running, not a scratch anywhere, and no fogginess at all after almost constant exposure to water.I'm very pleased, now I have to find one for me!!"
3,Not as comfortable as they look,"I was looking for a basic pair of sneakers that are good for walking. These shoes seem to fit my purpose and are on sale for a pretty good price. They are true to size and width, but not as comfortable as I thought. Walking in them for a mere ten minutes hurt my right foot both in the toe area and heel. I cannot figure out why it is the case..."
4,Surprised,"I read a lot of mysteries and this one I was not able to figure out the ending half way through the book. It is a well written book, but the ending came out of left field, not enough clues, that is the only reason I gave it a 4. I enjoyed the characters in the book and have gone on to read book number two."
3,"""Love the Way"" by Jorge Santana","The only reason I bought this CD is because I absolutely love the song ""Love the Way"" by Jorge Santana. This compilation CD was the only CD that has that song. The rest of the CD was just OK, but it was worth buying just for that song."
1,Neat concept -- failed to produce,This book had 15 pages of printed errata (errors) that I ended up going to the Waite group and downloading. The concept is cool -- take on-line quizzes and a discussion list (which was inoperative at the time I bought the book). The many errors in editing made it frustrating and the installation of the CD was not easy for a novice. The book sits on my shelf collecting dust.
5,A great resource,"This is an excellent book for learning perl. It gets you started on all aspects, such as CGI, but it is not the last word, of course. It is also a good reference. Because of the editorial mistakes in the first edition, this books reputation has suffered. That is unfortunate. It is not the only Perl book to own, but it is a useful one that you can rely on as you learn more and more of what Perl has to offer."
2,not a good choice,"This pan is not very versatile-by far my least used pan. It doesn't sit well on a stove burner, doesn't have terrific heat distribution and takes up a lot of storage space. It's basically a small wok with a lid. I love the all-clad line, but this pan is a loser. Buy a large frypan instead."
5,well-crafted potty humor,"Loved it, a perfect bathroom read. I do think Mintonmedia's review is, perhaps, yes, a little too oversensitive. Or, again, to think me twice about it, perhaps even not sensitive enough. Are Saunders and Smith poking fun? Oh yes, most certainly, but I think they point their sticky writing/painting fingers at all of us pious American dreamers (certainly not just those who happen to have worked their way here from the warm med-bath of Western Civilization)."
5,Can't go wrong with this,"The D'Aulaires are top-notch when it comes to illustration. Their art may feel dated compared to illustrations you see today, and they were even old-timey when I read this book as a kid, but I loved this book nonetheless. The storytelling is clean, and the illustrations are a treat to look at. <3 <3 <3 this book, highly recommended."
5,"Make that 1,000 stars!","I cannot praise this book enough. As several other reviewers have said, I checked this book out countless times as a child, and I can honestly say that it was my most beloved book as a youngster and changed the entire course of my life. Because of this book I have developed a profound love of the Classics and Ancient History that has been such a treasure to me throughout the years. Now I am majoring in Classics in college and plan to go on to graduate school, eventually hopefully becoming a professor in this area, and I honestly believe I owe it all to this book. It completely enchanted and enchants me, from the beautiful drawings to the stories to...just everything. Simply gorgeous and breathtaking. Recommended for people of every age who love timeless tales."
5,So good I refused to return it to the library . . .,"This is the one and only book I ever refused to return to the library. I was about five when I first found it, and I was so enthralled by the pictures and the stories that I just could not bring myself to return it. Even at that tender age I already had a long history as a library scofflaw when it came to returning books, but I always gave in eventually. Finally my mom had to pay the library for it, and that book has a place of honor on my bookshelf today, thirty years later. With over twelve nieces and nephews, I make sure each one has their own copy. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
5,Great for kids...,I've read this book since I was a child. My grandmother gave my sister and I this book and we read it til it fell apart. I purchased this so my baby will have it.
4,My Nephew Loves It!,"My nephew is a fan of Rick Riordan and I got him ""Mark of Athena"" for his birthday. I also gave him ""D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths"" to give him background of most of the Greek myths, gods, and goddesses because Riordan changes some of the myths in his books. He loves the illustrations."
5,This is the one to buy,"We have gone through 2 previous editions of D'Aulaires' quite quickly. The children love it. It makes sense to buy the library binding if your kids will read it a lot. The paperback just falls apart, and this book is a classic that you will return to for years. The art and story-telling are first rate!"
5,One of the best books of my childhood,"This was one of the books that I learned to read with back in 1967(down with Dick & Jane! yay Greek myths and archaeology!). I read the stories countless times, imitated the illustrations, wished I lived in ancient Greece, etc. It's still my reference book on Greek mythology because it's so clearly presented. Every kid can get something out of it."
1,$315 for a bulb?????,"$315 for a bulb? WTF?! I know the standard 55 watt #13355 bulb is about twenty bucks. Maybe this 85 watt version should be $31.50. PIAA products are always expensive, because you pay for all of that INCREDIBLE HYPE. Sometimes they even work. I don't know if Amazon hiccupped on pricing here, but I doubt anyone is crazy enough to order a replacement bulb for $315, even for a PIAA lamp. BTW, these prefocused PIAA bulb are proprietary and expensive. I strongly suggest lamps with readily obtainable bulbs, such as the universally available H3 halogen."
3,A bit of propaganda,"The author has included information on the topics shown in the title which were interesting and informative however, it is clear that the author is anti-development at the beach and this message comes though time and time again. With this much propaganda against building on the coastline I think the book should have been free."
5,An amazing journey through history and faith!,"My son and I heard this book on tape nine years ago, and frequently refer to it to this day. We were delighted to find it in print form. An amazing, true and vulnerable account of a man who stumbled into his destiny simply by doing the right thing a step at a time. Some incredible history. De Vaca was [...] when Columbus returned home in chains . . ."
2,Dies an early death,"I did not buy the 6 combo but the 5 combo. I just did'nt get the planer.I am a contractor in UT. First off the drill was out performed by my Panasonic 15.6 volt by both torque and length of run time, plus it's lighter and smaller. The sawzall needs a new blade quite often or it's run time is severally reduced. I have used a Dewalt and have received much better performance.The circ saw performed well but again the battery did not last as long as I would hope for. The flashlight worked very well. Over all I was quite disappointed with the Bosch combo.I never thought I would say this, but yellow kicked blues butt."
2,Not for me.,"I was looking forward to reading this book before I go see the movie. The concept seemed interesting to me. I found the book very difficult to read. What I did get was clever and funny but what I had to do to really understand it was too much for me. I consider my self and pretty literate person. I read a lot and many different things but I found getting through this very tedious and it wasn't fun, relaxing reading at all. Having the Kindle helped but in the end I gave up and didn't finish the book. It wasn't enticing enough for me to do the work I had to do to understand the writing. I'll check out the film and maybe I'll go back."
1,a waste of time,Life is too short and I have too many books to read to waste my time on this boring book. Just glad I got it from the library.
1,I didn't have a clue,"We always have to read books like this at book group, rather than anything with a proper plot. I think I started it half-a-dozen times before I gave up completely. It was dull and pretentious and I couldn't concentrate on any of the stories. I'm sorry but I really didn't enjoy it. After this book I decided to give up the book group. My girlfriend seems to enjoy it much more than I do, though, and she's still going. She seems to find the books much better than I do. And she seems to spend most of her time with her book group mates anyway these days. Maybe she'd rather be going out with David Mitchell or something."
2,Collage of short stories.,"The book just seems like six short stories to me, only interlinked because the same character name was used in a few. A few of the stories were good, and a few cliche, i.e., herroine that survives several murder attempts to win out in the end. If you like short stories then you'd probably like it."
5,No Complaints,"The book arrived in a short time and in perfect condition. I buy frequently from Amazon.com and have had really, really good luck with everything."
5,Ravishing,"This was a ravishing book. You may be tempted to get bogged-down and quit before the big payoff. Don't. When it all starts fitting together, it is mind-blowing. Mitchell is definitely a wordsmith and has quite a way with aphorisms. There are many great quotes in this book.It is not really a reincarnation story, although you can read it as such. It is about story itself and how the narratives we create for ourselves shape our reality. It is also, of course, about how stories are interconnected.My advice, aside from sticking with it, are to read the book before you see the movie, if you see the movie. Also, try The 1000 Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, a Mitchell book that is more of a traditional narrative or as much of one as you'll get with him and also pretty glorious."
3,Strange story,"I found this difficult to read. I made it through the first two stories, but I don't like stories that result in death, so it was not to my personal tastes. A little too catastrophic for me to continue. Maybe this will be the rare instance when the movie is actually better than the book."
3,Overrated,"The individual stories that comprise Cloud Atlas have insufficient reason to be joined together. Some of them are more engaging than others, but the overall effect for me was of an experiment that doesn't come off. A particular problem is the juxtaposition of science fiction material with realist, modernist material. Beyond the lack of sufficent thematic connection between all the parts of the book, the genre incongruency didn't work for me."
2,Cloud Atlas - Or In A Fog,Too much surrealism for my taste. Unable to finish book.............unususal for me. I was unable to relate to the characters in this story.
3,Poor formatting in the Kindle edition,"I have just begun this book (I am about half way through the second narrative), and so am not posting a review of the novel's content or style...I anticipate good things.I am, however, disappointed in the text's formatting for the Kindle edition. Many sentences are missing end punctuation, and many words run together with no spacing in between. I haven't run into this kind of poor formatting in other Kindle books. This is low quality work from the publisher."
3,cloud atlas,"Interesting concept but dialect difficult to read in first two sections. Enjoyable reading after that, but difficult beginning. If it hadn't been for my book group I doubt I would have perservered, but glad I did."
2,Confusing syntax,Some parts of the book were impossible to understand what the characters were saying since the writer felt compelled to use historical phrasing and vernacular. The disconnected nature of the narrative was hard to follow and the vague connections over time (comet like birthmark) were vague and meaningless. I guess the message was that the more things change (time shifts) the more they stay the same (strong overpower the weak). Another book that I couldn't wait to finish and move on.
3,Not impressed with the book,Really difficult to follow the plot (plots) I figure the movie was made because of the challenge to act in it. Actors sometimes take roles for this reason and don't really consider the audience. When I read about the movie and some of the hype I thought seeing it would be a good idea. Since I never read the book I bought this copy to read before I saw the movie. Once I read the book the movie was shoved to the back of my mind. Might see it some day.
4,Connected lives,"At first I wondered how the different lives were connected. I did have to go back to previous lives to remember the people and places when they were revisited. Once I had done that they all fell into place. I found it fascinating the way the language each life had, especially the speech of the future lives after the present. A very interesting story about a subject I find very interesting."
5,Amazing!,"Cloud Atlas is the most amazing book I have read in years. I bought it after seeing the movie which is also amazing and so deserving of all the awards it isn't going to be nominated for. Following six stories taking place from the early 19th century to two times in the future, it is complex, well-constructed so you don't get lost in the complexity, and beautifully written in six very different styles and languages (all different versions of English so don't panic). I bought the book so that I can read it closely and follow threads through the six different stories. It will be with me a long, long time. I can't think of a book I would recommend more highly."
3,It's OK,Hard to follow but everything is tied up in the end even if it doesn't all make sense. Read it so I would understand the movie better. My favorite sections were the ones dealing with the future. They were the easiest to follow and make sense of.
5,Fantastic,"The smoothness in which the sections transition, the connectivity between them tenuous and fragile, the progression of pacing and the lulls that are a product of its structure -- I'm hugely impressed with this novel."
3,Cloudy atlas,"disjoined, unclearly connected set of chapters, not a smooth flow from one century to the next and a very poor ending... very much a missed opportunity of a good idea..."
2,Sorry I read it,"I thought the book might be better than the reviews said the movie was. If it was, then the movie was really bad."
5,A worthy challenge for the reader,"This is a book worth calling in sick to work for. The characters are interesting, and while the detail in their dialect is challenging for the reader, this makes them believable and made me interested in their fates. I felt like I was thrown head first into the plot line and the shift between characters and time was very interesting.The only problem I had with the book was carving out enough time to finish it, as little bits of the plot and dialogue kept popping into my mind."
5,"Amazing, complex, thought-provoking book","The book was like nothing I'd ever read before. I bought it because I heard that the movie was difficult to follow, but worth seeing. I thought that if I read the book, the movie might be less confusing. I loved the book and it's woven together stories that kept my mind spinning and searching for links. Now I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out next week. I also enjoyed the extra section at the end where David Mitchell discusses the process involved in making his novel into a movie...very interesting."
4,It made me think,"I guess the best measure of a writer's work is what you think of a book after you finish reading it. Like some others, I was expecting a ""big"" ending that would tie all the stories together, but that big ending never came. Instead, over the days after finishing the book, I found myself spending a great deal of time thinking about what the author was trying to say. I can't say this was a great book (although I can say it was very well written), but I can say that it made me think -- and that alone makes the book worth reading."
1,Cloudy book,"I hope the movie is better than the book. It was just not what I expected, read 1/3 and gave up."
2,Not worth the effort,"The reviews that laud the authors writing ability are fair, but I'm left feeling this technical effort was a stunt with no purpose. The story covers a large span of time using language authentic to those times. Making the writing authentic to the times, comes only at the cost of making the reading difficult. Nothing additional is conveyed in the writing styles. Just the opposite, it leaves the reader to interpret the language.The linkages between the various characters through time, added nothing to the total story. Many of the individual stories where slow and of uninteresting consequence. At the end the story only conveys a trivial message, not made more interesting by the laborious stories.Overall, I feel misled by the other reviews. I believe they are fairly praising the authors skill, but over praising the result. Just because something is difficult to make, does not make it good.This is one of the few books, that may benefit from being edited down to a 2 hour screen play."
1,literary self indulgence,"I was constantly aware of the author's self conscious writing while struggling to wade through this book. I kept on hoping it would redeem itself in the second half. While it improved, I feel the various stories do not add up to a whole greater than a sum of its parts - in fact the disjointed nature of this book kept me from caring about or getting involved with the stories or characters. I fail to see why Mitchell structured the book as he did except to try to impress the reader with his literary craft. The stories set in the future took constant work to understand the showy, manipulated language. I was never able to move beyond the artifice of it. Perhaps it requires a British male sense of humor and class consciousness to find the characters of Cavendish and Frobisher more funny than obnoxious, pompous and annoying. There are better ways to reveal the consequences of human greed and cruelty than this book."
5,Subtle Magic,"I don't buy new books. I only get them as gifts or rescue them from used books stores, library sales, and thrift stores. I can offer no higher praise for ""Cloud Atlas"" than purchasing it, which happened after reading a wonderful review in the Washington Post book review, I marched right out and picked up a copy. Michael Chabon, one of my favorites, gave it a great review, so I didn't have much to worry about. The sheer level of brilliance and subtle magic to get these discordant stories to work together blew my mind away. My copy, which will stay with me a long time, is now with my girlfriend, who's floating up high, using her ""Cloud Atlas"" to navigate about."
3,Eh,Some of the stories were great and some of them were pretty boring. I like how the author ties it all together at the end but not sure I would really recommend it...
4,Overall Great,"I'll get the not so good stuff out of the way. I think the novel starts off kind of slow, and there are some sexual themes that I could do without. But I've got discriminating tastes in that regard.Okay that's all. Seriously. This book is an impressive piece of literature. If you haven't heard anything about it, the plot line moves through several different narratives within different genres and even different voices (some sections told more from a character's view rather than the omniscient narrator in others). It is engaging and intriguing, and I am excited to see the movie. Read the book if you have seen it, and don't let the quality of the movie bias your view of the book! It's great!"
3,"Good, confusing, engaging, unfinished","Artistic in execution, altruistic in content, unsatisfying in conclusion. Eleven more words required in my review; eleven pages in the book."
1,Cloud Atlas,"I'm sorry but I'm half way through the book and I'm lost. There's a few minor hints about the effects of each life to the subsequent one, but right now, I'm finding it difficult to get the gist of the story.As I said, I'm just about half way through so maybe it will hit me. Anyone reading this, please don't beat up on me. You may love this book but I've had to read and re-read several sections and wasn't sure I got what was going on."
3,Talented Writer but no point,"This book was a page turner only because I kept trying to discover the point of it all. I never found it. Seems like the author couldn't see the forest for the trees, or maybe he was just too focused on technique."
3,Good Book (same as movie),This is a good book. It tries to be epic but never quite reaches that level...still a good story though
5,Exquisite,"I grabbed this book for my Kindle on a whim, not knowing what to expect. I'm not going to get into an extensive review, but I can honestly say Cloud Atlas is one of the most unique, intriguing books I've read in years. There are so many layers to explore, rendering it worthy of multiple reads. Each story contained has it's own charm, it's own message, yet the themes throughout build and play off one another. David Mitchell is incredible. Cloud Atlas is incredible. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
2,Gimmicky bore,This book showed promise during the first two sections but got weaker as it went on. The part about the nuclear power plant reminded me of Harold Robbins. The publishers journey to the nursing home bored me. The last straw was the prospect of wading through a chapter of dialect. That's where I quit. Literary novel? I don' think so.
1,Complete and utter waste of time,"Wow, where to begin...rather than rehash the 1 star comments, I will concisely say that this book is not worth the read. I kept waiting for some type of meaningful connection between the short stories, but the only connection is that each story references a previous story. The difficult diction from the first story and sixth story was frustrating, and the pointless nature of most of the stories made me wish I could have my life back that I wasted reading this book. Other than the Somni story, this book was terrible. If you want to read a great book, try Cutting For Stone, Life of Pi, Dragon Girl series, or Game of Thrones (except for book 5, which is pointless and does almost nothing to advance the plot - much like Cloud Atlas)."
1,Scattered and sketchy.,I liked the premise but then was unable to pull the vignettes together to form a cohesive whole. There lacked continuity.
3,Pretentious and overambitious,"Though there were parts of the book that I truly enjoyed, I felt that Mr Mitchell was ""showing off "" his considerable literary talents rather than really trying to engage the reader. Why do I have to submit to ""tricks and puzzles""? I'm sorry if I'm old-fashioned but I want to feel that the author has something to say and isn't just trying to dazzle me with his writing talent."
4,Beautiful Contemporary Fiction,"I am truly enjoying this novel. I decided to purchase it after seeing the movie (don't judge me) and it's amazing. David Mitchell spins this wonderful web of lives that spans generations and weaves the imperfections of humanity into every page. I can see how this novel (just like the movie) is not for everyone. It takes its time to create some of its most vivid points, but it's worth it."
1,Is there a point?,"I started reading this book because it was categorized under ""dystopian"" in some reading list and the reviews seemed to be generous. But I can't, for the life of me, figure out what the point to the book is. The stories seen to barely intermingle, and the stories themselves seem to have vague plots to them that I can't get interested in. I trudged my way through the first story, hoping it would get better as some have said, and forced my way through the second, hoping still. I got through the third story, but just barely and skipped the fourth because I'm so sick of the change in writing styles. The 6th story was interesting enough once I figured out the new language but as I'm reading the center story, I'm trying to figure out why I'm even bothering. As far as I can tell, this book is just short stories that kind of intermingle. I don't even really like short stories that much."
1,cloud atlas,"I am a stickler for punctuation and when reading, I couldn't get past that within the first couple of pages. Several ""&"" replacing the word ""and"". Also did not care for the author's writing style. Just conflict of personal preference, might try the movie? :-)"
1,Boring and pretentious,"I heard an interview with the author and he sounded so nice -- but I have to say, the book was extremely disappointing. I could only read 3/4 the way through...it was like being inside the mind of a sexually frustrated 13 year old boy with the attention span of a gnat. The weird language wasn't convincing (for me) and mostly annoyed me (and I really tried to get into it). I am shocked at all the good reviews and the enormous praise for this book."
1,Just plain bad,"a) Most pretentious title of recent memory.b) There is not a single believable character, incident or line of dialog in this entire book."
5,Absolutely engrossing,"I'm not normally a book reviewer but I know what I like. Cloud Atlas is a unique book, it's not what I expected but I have not been bored at all. It's an amazing tale spanning several times frames. I really got involved with the characters."
3,ok novel,Have not finished the book yet. So far is a slow read... seems disconnected and not near as good writing skills as expected.
4,A tour de force of ingenuity,"This is a nest of Russian dolls, the stories stepping through time then cut off for the next story to begin, then backwards through time to complete the stories begun. A clever arrangement, a constellation of words, a map to our possible future. North Korea seems to win out at some point since a Jong-Il type is running the entire planet. But never mind, even he with his golden arches logo will be swept aside in the tide of time as humanity descends into brutality. Gorgeously written."
5,Fantastic,"A fantastic novel, to say the least. One of the best books that I have read in quite a while from a contemporary author. I especially loved the sections ""Letters From Zedelghem"" and ""An Orison of Sonmi-451"".This book is a challenge but well worth the work if you love to try reading something new and exciting.I had a little trouble getting through the first section but after that I was hardly able to put the book down."
5,Serendipity,"My chief complaint with this book is the title. I was actually looking for ""The Cloud Atlas"" by Liam Callanan when I picked up this instead in the library, realized my mistake and read it anyway. What a knockout!As other reviewers here say, the book features quite a welter of plot threads that take some time to weave into the fabric of a good story, but it's well worth the slight wait (my guess is you'll be hooked by the first page of chapter 3).Yes, Mitchell does flex and flourish his dialects, but not to the point of distraction. And, yes, the book ends on a sci-fi note, but I wouldn't cast it as science fiction alone. It simply deals with human relationships that bridge time and anonymity...including the past and well into a speculative future. I found myself feeling more connected to humanity; not only to today's living cohort but also to yesterday's and tomorrow's. Now that's a trick."
3,Wanted to like this book,I've read some of Mitchell's other stuff. This just is not his best work. It is lots of work for a decent but not great payoff.
2,Meh... Just meh...,"I don't understand why people are fooled by this book. The story is nothing more than poor trickery. The stories are OK, but the connection between them is poor and best and almost silly at times. The language used is well done, but the some of it becomes so hard to understand it makes it worthless... All in all don't listen to the hype..."
1,Lacking features found elsewhere.,"NetGear RO318 has the nicety of spoofing the currently-administering PC's MAC address, but provides no way to configure in an arbitrary MAC address (e.g., I want to configure the box for someone else).The UI is also clumsy to use for anyone who is familiar in any way with setting up a network, and the various screens are not really grouped in a logical way. Routing rules are also not very configurable (""exposed server"" rules seem to be restricted to TCP; there is no UI for accepting UDP in from the WAN)."
3,Not good as mentioned,I received this item on time as expected but the book condition didn't meet my expectation.
5,I love it! This is my new gift book for my friends!,"I have given this book to friends, and every single one of them loves it. The thing is, it's not just fun and insightful, AND like having your own fortune teller in the palm of your hand...but it's also very nicely made, with a beautiful, thick hardcover, with sensitively written words on aged-looking pages. The first time I picked the book up, I thought, ""This is so nice!"" It is not often you say that about just the book itself. It's a definite luxury item for your bookshelf, and your psyche. The author obviously put much care and thought into the words, the research, and the total look of this book, and that's very refreshing."
3,Adequate,"I am not a fan of the style of post production editing and graphics employed in this series. If you want a solid instructional video for improving basic skills look into Dirt Schools production. Its about the best I have seen short of taking a class via ""Bike Skills"":) www.dirtschool.co.uk"
3,DuckTales The Movie: Treasure of the Lost Chance,"When I saw this movie as a kid, it was without a doubt my favorite. However, after seeing the movie many years later, I've come to realize why critics refered to this as an ""Indiana Jones rip-off"". The film satisfies viewers with its amazing opening as Scrooge and gang travel in the middle of a desert to find the lost treasure of Coli Baba. Then after that, the rest of the film takes place in Duckburg. See where I'm going. This movie could've been so much more, but yet it lost its chance to not only gain a posisitve reputation among fans and critics, but also spawn a sequel or two (there were plans for several DuckTales movies following this one). Overall, its an entertaining movie for younger kids with the exception of some fans, but it falls short of capturing the true spirit of the DuckTales series. Either rent it or buy it for a low price."
5,One of the Best Disney Animated Films of All Time,"Though Ducktales did not get the publicity of the Lion King and Mulan, it is one of the greatest animated movies of all time. It features all the prominent characters of the cartoon show including Scrooge McDuck. It combined great adventure with humor and even a little bit of emotion. Simply put, all fans of the TV series should try this movie out. It won't disappoint anyone"
2,She could do so much better!,"I didn't even sample this one, I bought it immediately. ""ANYTHING from her would be great"" is what I thought. I was very disappointed. She could do so much better. I adore her from Jekyll & Hyde and will buy any CD she comes out with, but she is high quality material. This CD didn't do her justice."
1,An Unhappy Love Story,"Why would someone with a voice as sweet and pure as Christiane Noll choose for her debut solo album to showcase the least flattering elements of her usually delightful vocal skill on a collection of songs that for the most part are completely unremarkable? Those familiar with Ms. Noll's enchanting performance in ""Jekyll and Hyde"" know this budding star for her soaring soprano. Rather than accentuating that gift, Ms. Noll resorts to employing a harsh nasal belt that is overly-penetrating, and, in general, annoying. The selection of songs isn't much better. Many of them are from lesser known shows like ""Pipe Dream"" or shows that should be lesser known like ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."" Not one of the tracks ever catches fire, and the passion and excitement that filled her performance in ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is nowhere to be heard on this album."
3,...but where IS it?,"I look forward to this magazine, but after purchasing it on June 15th, still haven't started receiving it. As far as reviewing the mag, though, looking into the future it is bound well and the photos are good."
3,This magazine is average,"I have been wanting to expand the recipes I make and so I subscribed to Eating Well. After having received two issues now, I have to say that I feel that the magazine is just ok. There are some interesting articles and I have found in each magazine one or two recipes I want to try, but on the whole, the recipes that they list do not appeal to me. I probably would not be likely to re-subscribe."
4,No hype... this is really the best stainless steel travel mug you can buy!,"I won't repeat what everybody keeps saying. In short, this is the best stainless steel insulated tumbler you can buy, and at this price it is a steal. My only complaint is that it imparts a metal flavor to your drinks. But then again, every stainless steel mug I have tried has the same issue. Wish you could get something durable and insulated that doesn't change the taste of your drink!"
4,Not 16oz,"I really do like this travel mug because it keeps my drinks icy cold for hours. I haven't tried it with hot drinks yet, it's been too hot in CA to try it out yet! The only thing that disappoints me is that this does not hold 16oz. Once you pour your liquid in and then add ice it's overflowing. I poured in a measured 16oz and the liquid reached the top. So, you can pour in about 10-12oz if you want to add ice on top and probably 13-14oz if the liquid is hot. Don't pour all the way to the brim otherwise some liquid will leak when you twist the lid on. Other than that, it is easy to clean and fits nicely in my car cupholders."
3,Beautifully unsanitary,"I wanted to give these a high rating: we have 6 or so and they work exactly as advertised: spill proof, great insulation, and durable.Unfortunately, they're almost impossible to clean if you drink anything other than black coffee - getting something like milk residue out of the cap requires something like a pressure washer and a pipe cleaner. There are just too many nooks & crannies for crud to build up and there's very limited access to the worst places."
4,Great canteen!,"This is a great no-spill canteen. I've had it for about 3-weeks and have taken it in to work with me every day. I have only used it for water, since that is what I drink 95% of the time. It keeps the water cold for hours from what I can tell. Sometimes I have a slight challenge twisting the top on because I want to make sure it is lined up correctly to get a seal. It seems very well made. I will definitely report back on it in another few months if anything changes."
2,Never again,"I have had a Contigo Tumbler for about 5 years. I decided to buy this one because of the different colors. That was a mistake. This item does not work as good as the other one. My old one would keep coffee hot for at least 8 hours. The new one one keeps my coffee warm about 3 hours. As for the colors, after placing it my cupholder for a couple of hours they began wearing off around the edges. Save your money, because this item is not worth the price."
2,cleaning is a problem,"The insulation is great. Leak proof. However, I can't figure out how to keep the lid clean. I drink coffee with milk and can smell something on the lid after a few weeks. My husband only drink black coffee: no yukky smell on his so far."
4,Great leak proof mug!,This mug is great! I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he really likes it. It keeps liquids hot and is totally vacuum sealed. I used it just today and liked it so much I'm thinking of getting a second one for myself!
1,Takes a month to ship?,I'd like to try this item but apparently it's going to take 3-5 weeks before it even ships. AmazonLLC confirmed this. Anyone else know why this item takes a month to receive? Is it shipped from Australia? Be sure to check the fine print.
5,Better than the (Eco) TV advertised mug,"I mainly use this spill proof tumbler to keep liquids cold (on a hot day). As a mail carrier on the street for several hours, this is a great mug to refresh your thirst with cold liquids. The main difference between this mug and the TV advertised mug,(besides keeping liquids cold) is it can fit in your personal cooler (standing up) along with the ice packs. That TV advertised mug, is too tall for closing the ""cooler"" lid. In regards to hot liquids, I'd be very careful about putting excessively hot liquids in this; the cold liquids will work just fine. Another great thing about this tumbler is the push button feature that will keep any liquids from spilling on you as you drink. One last tidbit, if you put a few ice cubes to start, that will keep the liquids cold even longer. Enjoy!!!"
1,Impossible to Clean,"I've owned this product for about two months.It functions perfectly, but it is impossible to clean. I drink only unsweetened beverages, water and tea without any sugar, honey, or anything else, but the lid is just a breeding ground for bacteria. I make sure to rinse it every night, but if you forget once it starts smelling horrid. I've tried soaking it in bleach overnight, but as soon as the soapy smell went away the stink came back. I've also tried cleaning it with toothbrushes and q-tips, but there's just no way to clean everywhere under the lid because of how the lid is designed.Maybe if you plan on only using it for water it might be fine, but for anything else you will eventually just make yourself sick drinking from this."
5,"No spill, keeps coffee hot","I bought this coffee mug a couple months ago and I have used it every day. I have never had a problem with it leaking,it keeps my coffee or tea hot and if I don't get a chance to drink it on my way to work it stays at least warm enough to drink for a few hours. It was more money than I would usually spend but I think I'll get a lot of use out of it."
2,Poor quality,"Works as expected, but my (blue) contingo appears as if it was handled while the paint was wet, leaving smudges that expose the steel underlayer on the side of the container.With the recent price increase on one of the most expensive travel mugs, this seems a little unacceptable."
4,Leak Proof!,I just received the product yesterday (on time) and it looks nice! I poured my coffee and sweetener in and shook it up - no leaks! I bike to school so that is all I was looking for. Happy with the product so far. The only thing I wish it had was a grip pad at the bottom. A bit worried the color might chip off but we'll find out!
3,It's just too fragile,"This Contigo Autoseal tumbler has to be the best coffee tumbler I've ever owned until today when I knocked it over on a sidewalk while getting my bicycle ready to ride. Before today it never leaked a drop and kept the coffee hot or the water cold for hours until it took a tumble. It leaked immediately. Go ahead...buy it; but don't drop it. Regarding the smell other reviewers have written about, I have not had that problem at all. I wash the top as soon as I'm finished using it. That said, since I primarily use this one for coffee, if I fill it with water the water will taste a bit like the coffee that was in it earlier. No problem. It doesn't bother me. So, except for the leaky cap, I would have given this one five stars. It's just too fragile."
2,"Leaked after 5 months, broke after 6","Had no trouble cleaning it and did so every day. Started leaking coffee after 5 months of daily use, then broke completely after 6 months. Tipped over and the lid hit a hard surface, smashed completely. Tried this one, Oxo, and Nissan and they all leaked, will have to find another."
1,Plugs up/Can't be cleaned,If you use cream in your coffee this mug is not for you. I have gone through 2 of these mugs in 3 months. If you use cream crud will build up and there is no way to clean the top. If you drink you coffee black like my wife does it is a five star item. If you use cream save your money.
1,Was great until it broke,"I purchased this product last week and when I first began using it it was great. It kept things hot, was spillproof, etc. When I was at work it tipped over on my desk and exploded (there was coffee EVERYWHERE). The top was appropriately sealed and I had closely followed the instructions for use. It was my third time using it. The top is broken now and the mug is completely unusable. I was SUPREMELY disappointed with this product."
2,insulates well until you exit the 1 year warranty,"Bought 2, one for my wife and one for myself in june 2011. within about a year I noticed a lack of insulating abilities. Today my wife mentioned to me the she has been noticing the same thing.Warranty is 1 year. I contacted contigo. They apologized, but gave me a 20% off coupon. I had to explain to them that even with 20% at their website, amazon was cheaper.Being a materials engineer I may run a quick home experiment on a new vs old mug, thermocouples in each, both with the same starting temperature water. Its easy to prove that the products lost vacuum over time during normal use. (a problem often found with many vacuum insulated products)"
2,Contigo autoseal west loop stainless steel travel mug,"I don't recommend buying this mug. It arrived dented, and when I called Amazon to let them know about it - they said I could receive a discount back to my credit card. I never got the discount. I decided to go ahead and use my dented mug - after using it for about 2 weeks I noticed that my lipstick had made a permanent stain that I could not wash off. I decided to just throw it away and buy a different mug. I can attest to the fact that this mug does not leak and it does keep liquids hot or cold - but it is hard to clean."
1,Pretty Colors-Stupid Design,"I bought this mug because of the high reviews and because I could get it in purple. It does look nice. The stupid part is in order to drink with the lid on, you have to squeeze the button on the side so liquid will come out. This is already a pain in the butt, but the kicker is, when the hot coffee comes out, it burns me every time! I cannot drink hot coffee this way. Somehow it always hits my mouth in the wrong spot. Also, who wants to have to hold in a butten every time you take a sip? Okay, so it is leak-proof with the lid on, big deal. What I end up doing is taking the entire lid off and drinking my coffee without the lid when I get to work. Pretty stupid, right? Well, I paid for the stupid mug, so I guess I'll continue using it that way. But I don't recommend it unless you want to use it for something other than a hot liquid."
1,Target/Amazon customer service is SORELY lacking,"This review is more about customer service than the item itself. The item depicted is almost what I received on the first shipment. I wanted this exact mug. I liked the idea of a metal mug and my car's interior is graphite in color and my car is red, so I thought great, non-plastic travel mug, looks like it was made for my car except what I got was a graphite mug with a blue button. Okay so I returned it and explained the problem clearly. I wanted the item with the red button as shown on the website. I received the exact same mug blue button. Picky? Perhaps but it's my $20 being plunked down and they don't even read the complaint in order to resolve the problem which compounded it."
3,good insulation but very hard to clean,"Like many others have said, the lid tends to get filled with nasty gunk, and is a real pain to clean by hand. From reading these reviews I see the instructions said you could wash the top in the dishwasher. That might have made a difference for me -- I thought the instructions said none of it was dishwasher safe. As it is though, in cleaning the plastic lid yesterday, I seem to have made some indentation that now causes it to leak. So now it's useless. I bought a different brand."
3,Lids get smelly and hard to clean,This CUP is great; however the lid is very hard (impossible to clean) even with a baby bottle nipple brush and it starts to smell and impart a crappy taste into the next cup. My husband drinks tea and won't use this cup because it makes his tea taste like coffee. I now use it as a carafe at home and pour half a cup into a mug because it would keep my coffee warm while I neglect it and chase kids around the house instead.
5,Finally a truly leak proof mug!,"Yes. It it truly leak proof. Easy to use, nice looking and DOES NOT LEAK! Keeps coffee hot for hours. The only down side is that it can't be put in the dishwasher."
3,Keeps liquids hot,"It serves its purpose, keeps liquids hot and sealed inside. I rated it as just okay because it keeps my coffee too hot for too long. In the morning after I get to work the coffee is still too hot to drink. I'd say it's a thermos first, and a coffee mug second."
5,Really leakproof,"I have had this tumbler before and that's why I ordered it again. I have tried others but none are as good as these. When I couldn't find them in the stores, I looked on Amazon and found them."
5,Great product.,I had been given one of these tumblers as a gift and loved it so bought them for my team at the office - all different colors so no confusion for anyone - they also love them! They do NOT leak or drip & keep hot/cold for several hours.
5,Great Product!,"I bought this for my wife as a birthday present and she loves it. She even trusts the cup to go into her coach bag, that should tell women how good it is. The claim that the coffee will stay hot for four hours is a stretch I think, but it will stay hot long enough for my wife to enjoy it. She is happy, so I am happy. I recommend."
5,This is a mug we love to use!,I just bought this for my boyfriend and we love it! It does not spill when you turn it over and it is easy to sip on. I would definitely recommend this to others if they are considering buying a mug!
5,Love it!,"I read the reviews and was a little scared what with the cleaning issues. After receiving this item however, I don't care! I love it so much. It's weighty, but not heavy, and feels like high quality. The great news is if the lid for some reason doesn't function any longer the company has replacements online at $7. I think the button idea is so amazing. VERY easy when driving. I am glad I bought this and if it broke, I'd buy it again. As for the cleaning, a toothbrush, q-tip, paint brush, or very small bottle brush would be perfectly fine. So far, I just rinse it out with hot soapy water after use and that works."
5,Worry-free at last,"I used to burn myself, spill all over my keyboard, etc etc etc. now i can hold my tea in my lap, juggle it while i'm carrying 8 other things, set it on a seat or couch, all without worry. if you use a cup 10 hours a day, 5 days a week like i do, this is the cup for you.only cons are timing the button push and drinking takes a few minutes to get used to at first, and you need to be careful with boiling liquids--vacuum seal & boiling liquid can cause problems"
5,It's brilliant,"Pretty much the best travel mug I have ever owned. Stuff that you want to stay hot, stays hot. Liquid inside doesn't leak out. If you are looking for anything else in a travel mug, you probably have problems making all sorts of decisions."
4,Leak proof but difficult to clean,"This tumbler is great for keeping coffee warm and has never leaked. I am only giving it 4 stars because it is difficult to clean with hard to reach nooks where gunk can easily build up. In the future, however, I will stick with the style sold at Caribou Coffee, which is also stainless steel but has a simple flip top that is easy to clean and is also leak-proof. I think this is one of them, although it is hard to tell by the picture: [...]"
1,"Almost great, with a major taste problem","I'm sad to have to leave a negative review of this product. I love the overall aesthetics and ergonomics of this product. It also does a fantastic job of keeping things hot for a long time. However, none of this matters when the liquid its storing comes out with a horrendous taste. No matter how many times or methods I try to use to clean the lid, everything I put into the mug comes out with an ""off"" rubbery/plastic taste. The lid also seems to trap smells, as even after repeated cleanings it smells like the last drink the cup contained. I've tried the various suggestions for cleaning found elsewhere in the reviews, but none of them have seemed to help. My advice is to avoid this mug. It costs too much to ruin your morning coffee."
2,Standard product,Why did you choose this rating? ExperienceWhat did you like or dislike? Does not keep the heatWho would you recommend this product to? I would not advise product experience
1,Wish Contigo would provide a tool to clean the lid,"I wish Contigo would provide a tool to clean the lid.I am immune suppressed due to a transplant and am afraid of bacterial build up in the lid.I have found that pouring hydrogen peroxide in the lid upside down, let it soak, then rinse with hot forceful water."
3,Totally Spill Proof - But will rust!,"My husband loves his cup - it has never spilled, even after many months of daily use. The problem we've had with this Silver tone tumbler and eventually spots of rust appeared on the outer side of it. The inside stayed super shiny and spotless but on the outer wall where I believe two pieces of metal were joined, spots of rust appeared and won't come off. They are really small no bigger than the stars they use for review here, but there are several of them and they make it look like junk!Since we love the tumbler except for that I recently ordered a Blue one - so far it's remained fine and shows no rust. Keeping our fingers crossed as I've got my eye on the purple one but if this blue one rusts too, I won't buy it. No one wants to drink from an ugly cup no matter how fine it is inside or how perfectly it holds liquids and keeps them hot for many hours."
2,Keeps Coffee Hot but It Leaks,"Mug I got had a ""100 Percent Leak Proof"" wrapper on it. When I opened the mug, I read the small print notice inside that stated ""not guaranteed against leaks"" (confusing!). I was warned then because I found that it leaks if it's turned on its side or falls over. I gave it two stars because it does keep the coffee hot for over 4 hours and it's got a comfortable grip but I have to be careful with it because it needs to be on a level surface. I can't take it to work or on travel because it leaks."
5,awesome mug,"My wife and I each got one of these for Christmas, they work great. Coffee stayes warm for at least 4 hours. They really don't spill, I have turned mine upside down just to check, not a drop. I would recommend these mugs to anyone."
2,regular,"no llego en perfectas condicione, no esde muy buena calidad, ademas de economico, llego con la tapa partida, mal embalaje"
4,Pretty good cup,"It retains heat much better than a normal cup, but I used to have a vacuum sealed cup before this, and it does not hold the heat as long as the other cup did (it's maybe 65-70% as good.) The autoseal is awesome, however if you have anything inside the cup that might break up (small tea leaves for instance) they can get jammed in the seal which you drink out of, and in that case the cup can leak if it is on its side or especially upside down. It's surprisingly hard to get things unjammed once they get stuck in the autoseal mechanism - after drinking it with tea I am often afraid to leave it on its side unless I wash out the autoseal with water removing any blockage.The cup has its downfalls but it still works well and does essentially what it says it would. I'm not sure if there is anything better out there. If you drink tea or want the liquid to be kept hot for more than a few hours, maybe you should continue looking and see if you can find something better suited."
4,Nice,"I read the reviews before ordering this during the lightning deals.I keep the lid rinsed and wash it like my other coffee cup covers, in a bowl with baking soda, vinegar and water. Rinse some more.It keeps my coffee very HOT which I like. In fact I do not put the cover on right away, to let it cool a bit. However it took some time getting use to how the coffee comes out when I am use to a lip/rim around all my other travel cups. Also when you put hot coffee in it and then the cover, besure to press the button to open the mouthpiece prior to bringing close to the face as it creates a vacuum and a little coffee will splash out. Enough to get on your glasses/face etc.Also I was surprised how TOP heavy this coffee mug/tumbler is."
4,Coffee travel mug,"I like the style and it's leakproof, but it is NOT the best for keeping my coffee hot for over two hours."
4,"Best ""leak-proof"" Tumblers I've used...","...and I've used a lot of tumblers. The last one I owned worked well, until the plastic broke when I dropped it. From a height of about 5 inches. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that sometimes fluid becomes trapped in the lid and when you try to show off the mug to your friends, it drips out and they all yell ""Oh, yeah, it totally is leak proof! LOL!"". Plus, let's face it, it isn't easy on the eyes."
5,Love my Contigo!,"I love that it is no spill, one hand open and it keeps my coffee hot for almost 4 hours. I also love that it's stainless. I only wish I would have gotten the 20oz over the 16oz. I would highly recommend this item!"
2,Burns your lips,"Pros:Umm, it seals well and doesn't leak.It keeps things hot.Cons:It burns your lips off.I ended up hating it after using it a couple times. No lip on the lid to sip from. So you basically have hot coffee instantly in your mouth. It was like drinking hot magma from a straw or a sport water bottle. Ended up returning it and gettingThermos Stainless King SK1005MB4 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug, Midnight Bluewhich has been excellent."
2,Too much possibility for lip burn,"Bought this as a replacement for an older model Starbucks Stainless Mug which I use with my Keurig. While the Contigo is probably better as a genuine travel mug because it has an excellent seal, I find it impossible to use comfortably. For reasons I can't fully explain, when I test the temperature of the coffee without the lid, it seems fine. Put the lid on, vent it and invariably I burn my lip. So I take the lid off, wait a minute more and now the coffee is lukewarm. I feel like the Princess and the Pea, but this does not work for me."
1,Not so hot!!!!,"The container stores the content hot for an hour. After that, my coffee was Luke warm and disappointed me to a great extent despite the reviews!."
5,Cartigo Mug,"This is it! If you travle or work around computers you want this mug!We are a family that has thrown out all of the other travle mugs and just have a number of these. The mugs have been droped, tiped over next to a computer and nothing! No mess, no stress just pick it up and keep on going."
3,Good Mug but doesn't keep the liquid hot for long,"Good mug, absolutely spill proof, but won't keep the liquid hot too long. Its written keeps hot for 4hrs but I guess it should be 2hrs max."
1,Ew travel mug,"This is definitely the best travel mug I've ever owned - it looks nice, is relatively compact, and doesn't leak. But, there's the issue of the lid. I would drink mint tea in it, clean it, put coffee in it, and the coffee would taste like mint. The same thing happened with orange mandarin tea, which was really gross. But- last night I turned the lid upside down in my sink, put a squirt of dawn direct foam in it, and some really hot water, and let it soak overnight. When I rinsed it out this morning, all the smells were gone. It worked better than putting the lid in the dishwasher. Maybe this is the answer? I really don't want to give up on this mug.Update - a few months laterOK - it's not so great anymore.The smells are staying in the mug, and the dishwasher isn't doing the trick on the lid. I won't even drink out of it anymore. My husband uses it as a last resort. This thing refuses to be cleaned properly. Don't do it. I wish I hadn't."
2,Contigo - funtional but not durable,"I just purchased one of these mugs a couple weeks ago. The mug performs as advertised and is indeed spill proof (If a bit difficult to clean properly). Unfortunately, I dropped mine last week and the top separated into two pieces, so my impression is that they are not durable. The company of course does not warranty against drops and I don't blame them, but travel mugs WILL be dropped and should be designed with this in mind."
5,amazing,"I bought this CD for two reasons: 1. it's written by the same people who wrote Les Miserables (my favorite musical) and 2. Lea Salonga sings the lead. I am so glad that I bought it.The performances all around are awesome but especially Lea's. Her innocent yet powerful voice fits perfectly with the character of Kim. The other performers are very good and the score also conveys the sadness of the story. While on that subject, let me say that this is NOT a happy story so don't listen to it expecting to be uplifted.But definitely get this recording. I haven't seen it on stage but I plan to as soon as possible whenever that may be."
4,"Good, though not the better one","Competent singing all around. Lea Salonga makes a great pair with Simon Bowman's fantastic rendition of Chris. ""Why God Why"" is unbeatable here. Claire Moore, though a proven singer, sounds a tad too old for the part of Chris' wife Ellen. Salonga's ""Room 317"" is all at once frighteningly realistic yet saddening, but in certain songs, such as ""Dju Vui Vay"" her voice gets breathy and loses ""roundness"" in the high notes. One winning factor in this CD though, is the Finale, in terms of music, lyrics and arrangement, is much more superior to that in the CSR. It's darker and more poignant, which is typically unlike a mainstream musical such as this."
4,"Great CD, just a little disappointed","I love Miss Saigon, but I bought this CD just because of Lea Salonga. I really love her, but I was a little disappointed in this performance. I watched her in Miss Saigon in 2001 and thought she was amazing. She sung the songs with much more power. I thought she was good in the CD, but not great. She was only 18 when she recorded this CD. I guess it was a mistake thinking she sung as well as she does now. I did love the CD, though, and I'm happy I bought it. The reason I keep listening to it is for the great songs and story. They lyrics really are amazing."
3,"To ""Sharon matthews"" from the United States","(from the music fan from asia)Nope,I did not buy the highlights CD. I purchased the same set that everyone else on this page purchased. If u examine the track list above,you won't find a Sun and Moon(reprise) track, which on the Broadway show, was sung only by Kim alone (no Chris). In this 2 cd set, you ONLY get 1 version of Sun and Moon (Kim and Chris), not both. If you also listened to both 2 CDs, you would never find the track where Kim meets Thuy's ghost. Watch the show again and you'll know what I mean. There are missing tracks after all!"
4,Miss Saigon soundtrack,"Saw the musical for the first time, and was fun to hear the original soundtrack. Of course, the quality was superb."
3,Misleading title,"I bought this because I want to be a romance writer, and I was looking for information that would help me in this market as well as give me writing tips. It does a good job on the first count, but it was not very useful for me, a beginner, who did not know anything about writing romances. So the title is misleading."
4,Marcy bench great product for price and utility,"Ive had this bench for about a month and it has worked quite well for me. After a little use it has become the slightest bit wobbly but this is very very slight, hasn't affected performance, and probably could be mostly or completely fixed if i tried tightening up the bolts. Very light, folds up nicely which you can't find on heavier sturdier models. A great product and quite cheap for what it does. The 4 angle settings also makes all the difference. A very good product"
4,"Excellent, Romantic book","I read a lot of historical romance books and rarely is a book good enough that it really stays with me. Anyone can write a book, but Judith Ivory is a truly gifted, talented writer. She expresses the thoughts, feelings and emotions of the characters on a much deeper level than most other historical romance writers. This book is full of real, true romance. It is witty and funny, the characters are rich and full of life. Mick is the tall, handsome, strong man ( and oh so charming!) and Winny the sweet, insecure introvert. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like a beautiful heroine and Winny was too tall, freckled with a humped nose and no breasts.....Otherwise, it was perfect with a wonderful ending! I didn't lose interest for a single page."
4,Good notebook-but not perfect,"This computer is pretty solid - and is typical for Mac users. Its speed, software, and memory are all very good. These things I'm sure you've already heard -- there are a few drawbacks to this computer, though. Battery life - even after calibration - will never be 4.5 hours, I can at best get 3.5 hours out of it. The CD drive is loud and can be bothersome, although this doesn't seem to be a problem when watching DVDs. Battery heating is noticeable but not as bad as some reviews that I've read claim that it is - maybe the problem was fixed after the recall. It's a solid machine and I'm pleased with it."
4,AT LEAST IT'S A START!,"I've been a Helen Reddy fan for many years. As a teenager in the'70's, I started buying her albums (which I still want ALL of onCD...how about it, Capitol?) and my 1977 high school graduation gift: two tickets to her concert that week- I was thrilled! If wecould only have one CD, though, this would be it. Helen showed anamazing ability, along with her producers, to pick great songs to release. My favorite is ""You're My World,"" which she just soars on! I wish there would have been room for ""The Last Blues Song,"" etc., but I'll keep hoping for more on CD. BUY this one!"
5,amazing,"This DVD is great. The sound and picture quality are both high and when they say uncensored they mean it. If a volume 2 came out tomorrow I would snatch it up. The only drawback is that some of the songs are a little outdated for 2003, but still worth the money."
4,Compelling,"This account is rich in details yet rarely gets bogged down in them. The authors keep the momentum flowing so that you nearly feel you're right there with Waters and Glassford as events unfold. More personal anecdotes from individual veterans about life in Anacostia would've been a fine touch but probably too much to ask for. Integration among the veterans, a truly unique social situation, deserved more attention, too. The bigger, political picture is the real focus of the book, however, and the authors cover several years and numerous people in a very readable, concise fashion."
1,A disappointing effort,"This book is a rather disappointing effort. It appears to be a cut-and-paste job of previous accounts. Worst of all, it repeats the falsehood that Douglas MacArthur deliberately disobeyed President Hoover in crossing the Anacostia bridge during the climactic end of the Bonus Army on July 28, 1932.Historians have long known better. See for example, Perret's ""Old Soldiers Never Die"" (Random House 1996)The story of the Bonus Army was an interesting event in the Depression era- combining the confused politics and economics of that time with nearly unprecedented societal anxieties. One can only hope a more worthy modern examination will be forthcoming."
1,"THIS AIN""T EVEN BASS MUSIC",WHat the hell iz this!?! DO Not insult the BASS MUSIC industry with these artists or this music. This is Hip-Hop Not BASS. Get it STR8!!!!
3,"Great, but...","This is a great stroller, folds, moves, looks great, but it is pretty heavy and takes up a lot of room when folded. I have a large suv and I can't go grocery shopping and have it in the car - not enough room for bags. I can't imagine getting it into the trunk of a normal car. You would absolutly have no room for anything else. I think those snap-n-go strollers for the infant car seats are a much better bet. You'll end up buying a lightweight compact umbrella-type stoller anyway and then probably a jog stoller. This is a good stroller, but we never use it anymore and my daughter is only 9 months."
1,I should've shopped around more,"I would have to agree with some of the other moms and dads when they say it's ""the worst stoller ever!""It IS very heavy. It does take up the whole trunk. Save your money and shop around."
2,Should have ignored Consumer Reports,"I bought this stroller because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. What a joke. I wonder if the Consumer Reports reporter was a shareholder of Graco prior to making the recommendation for this stroller. I regret spending so much money on this thing. It's heavy, awkward to maneuver at times, takes up a lot of space, reclining mechanism not easy to adjust, and weak wheel pins. I made a temporary repair to the wheel pin after the back wheel fell off during a walk - boy, was that ever a pain in the butt inconvenient. I will have to call graco for a replacement pin. I shouldn't have relied so much on Consumer Reports and relied more on my own practical needs."
3,A loveless life of sexual abuse leads to hysteria,"The repetative nature of this book is the purpose. From the point of view of the victim's mind, abuse and torment flash in from all parts of her life, melding into one horrible life. The events become clouded in the mix, and therefor it is not one event, but her life, that drives her to violence. Exploring the liks between sex and violence, and the racial stereotypes inherit in them as well, Jones proves ahead of her time. The style and language remain beautiful, in sharp contrast to the tortured events of the novel."
4,Good quality slotted turner/spatula,"Good quality, solid turner. Useful for a variety of cooking chores. Narrow, though, so not for large items like pancakes."
1,Dont buy this CHINESE made junk.,"I was trying to make changes that are healthier for my family, including using less plastic and a steel spatula. I bought the all clad because I thought they were made in America, but No - this is made in China, where a lot of steel products are made with dangerous cadmium and other items (even when supposedly checked by a US marketing company). If you want something made in China just buy a cheap $5 one, no reason to pay more for this."
2,"mattc's controller review (a ""before you buy""guide)","i think this controller is ok it looks cool.i think it has good design also.it is cool since it has a colour mix.I prefere Jet Black Controllers better thuogh.The Indigo/clear is also cool,but,theres something that for starters might be a big inconvenience.The Z button is in front of the R shualder button sso with the conroller and the Z button purple,you might not see it that well if you havent gotten used to the feeling and scheme of the controller,thats what my in-convienience is. thanks for reading my guide for before you buy (thats my opionion anyway)bye and take advisory about what ive said i know this because of relyable sorces.HAPPY GAMECUBE!!!!!!"
5,The best controller...,"Look, this is plainly the BEST single controller ever! It crushes XBox, blows away N64, and dominates Play Station 1 and 2! I can't get enough of this slick little device; it's fantastic! The Super Pad looks just as good."
1,Poor Discription!,"This converter is made cheaply, hence the price! It is mainly for SMALL items,I bought this item and found it to blow fuses for anything i used other then a cell phone. IT Borke easy when it fell out of the socket.THE PRICE EXPLAINS EVERYTHING!"
1,Really?,"I couldn't make it past the sample. The writing is so high-school. My 11-year-old writes like this. The dialogue is stilted. In fact, everything is stilted. The plot may be interesting, but I can't bear the slog to find out."
4,Confused! well let me help you,"Ok this book is BIG disappointment for some people and for someit's entertaining. Well I don't see that these two schools ofthought have any thing to say against each other. Any way, buy this book if you want to learn about XML in a fun way. It's not technical so you hard-core-programming-book lovers stay out. I read this book when I started XML. Why I picket it because it didn't seem that heavy. Any way now here I am on my XML highway more or less satisfied with this book. Its definitely lacks some important things like schema... Watch out for its new edition when it hits market. Ok here are my final words: If you are casual in nature go for this. If you hate B-Movie or FUN-Way of learning something don't buy it."
4,Well-written overview for savvy readers,"I didn't pay for this book (I checked it out from my local library), and I started reading at Chapter 7 (XML and CSS), but I enjoy the author's style. Having written a couple of technical books myself, I understand the pressure to just parrot the spec or the manual and I am pleased to see that Simpson brings real thoughtfulness to his subject. Instead of describing the syntax of CSS, he explains ""the style problem"" that led to SGML and offers one reason why HTML is more popular than earlier technologies. Then he describes the syntax.Reading other, more negative reviews, I wanted to add my positive opinion of the book. Perhaps some of those who were disappointed were hoping for more of a verbose spec, or a canned application. I prefer the thoughtful FAQ that this book seems to be."
5,lives up to its reputation,Used at the French Culinary Institute in NY. This sauce pan has marvellous heating attributes. It will perform perfectly using stovetop heating at lower levels than you are used to because of it ability to conduct heat and retain it.
5,The one!,"Specific, easy to read and very helpful. Organized for quick reference. I was able to see exactly which stage my Mom is in and what to expect next. If you buy only one book, make it this one. No kidding."
4,great info but hard to read,"I was really looking forward to receiving this book which came recommended during a dementia dialgue lecture. The information presented has proved to be all that I was hoping for, but the type is very faint and makes reading very difficult. I almost suspect that a problem has occured during the printing process. I feel like I am straining to read the info. Headings are in darker, bolder print but the body of the chapters is extremely light print."
2,"Polished, But Dull","A very polished and professional sounding recording, but the songs just aren't memorable. A good try, but two thumbs down."
4,Better than you might think,"Blue Murder was the ""solo"" project Jon Sykes put together after he was summarily fired from Whitesnake by David Coverdale. All of the guitar work on ""Slide It In"" and ""Whitesnake"" was done by Jon Sykes. Prior to Whitesnake he was also in the final version of Thin Lizzy (""Thunder and Lightning"") and in a band called Tygers of Pan Tang which was part of the NWOBHM along with Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Saxon, Girlschool, etc.With that kind of pedigree, expectations should be high. Jon put together a great band with Carmine Appice on drums and Tony Franklin (The Firm) on bass. What they put out in 1990 was a hard rock epic in ""Valley of The Kings"" and a seemingly made for MTV blues ballad in ""Jelly Roll"". The rest of it was not particularly memorable, but it wasn't crap either. If you like ""guitar rock"", ""classic rock"", or even ""hair bands"" you'll probably like this."
4,Better than most,"Blue Murder didn't last long and their only real claim to fame as this group were the songs jelly roll and valley of the kings, yet they were far better than most of the "" hair bands "" of the 80's and early 90's.One reviewer claimed anyone over two digets in their age were apparently in his mind a moron for liking this cd. Well, I must say I find that kind of thinking to be narrow minded and offensive. Just because he didn't like this cd doesn't make it bad.I found it to be refreshing on many levels and while i wasn't enamoured of all the tracks, most were quite well done and easy to listed to. Valley of the Kings being my favorite.Before rejecting this cd outright, why not give some of the tracks a listen then decide if it's worth it."
4,"Solid, well-written album","If you noticed a difference in the sound of Whitesnake's self-titled album and it's follow up, Slip of the Tongue, it was due to John Sykes. When he left Whitesnake the talent left with him. Blue Murder sounds just like Whitesnake at their best. This album has tight, flowing harmonies that, unlike most metal songs, never grow tiresome. Buy this album."
1,The Worst Marduk CD,Opus and La Grande are the worst Marduk CD's. I would recommend Panzer Division instead its faster played Black Metal not repetitive like Opus and doesn't drag out to be unmemoriable.
5,This is really,"Dark and sad and a touch hopefull Passion shows more then ever why Peter Gabriel has always been a creative musical force. Gabriels synths not only hold most of the songs together but Gabrial plays more instruments then on his studio albums (synths, percussion, shakers, bass, whistle, flutes, surdu, doholla, counterbass, thats a dozen instruments!) and all with class. Of cource the musicians and vocalists Gabriel has selected are all stunning (Gabriel does some nice wordless singing himself) but they are merely performing his visionary compositions and arrangements. This is very much Gabriels show all the way and this is really his best soundtrack album."
5,Everyone on the planet must hear this,"I've just read all the reviews for this CD and I don't know if I can reall expand on them,but I'll try! The first time I heard this I was walking through a forest in France,and I had to sit down on the forest floor,I was gobsmacked! This is the most amazing music I have ever heard!Everybody should hear it! I am very lucky in the fact that I am living on the edge of the Kalahari in Namibia,and when the sunsets over the red dunes I go outside and play this music VERY loud!I wish everyone could hear it that way. By the way,I have alot of 'world music""and nothing compares to this....."
5,If you only own one CD...,"make it Passion... this has to be one of the greatest CD's in history. I have never seen the movie, but this CD is SO enthralling! It is hauntingly beautiful and surreal... a definite Must-Have!"
5,Essential !,"This is a magnificent piece of music that, like most great music, gets better with repeated listenings. One of the five CDs I'd take to a deserted island."
5,excellent tool,i love all All-Clad and this is the perfect size and weight. i will buy more all-clad kitchen tools soon.
4,Detention camps for German nationals,Mostly this is part of history that we haven't seen in the books:where German nationals ( like the Japanese in California) were rounded up and warehoused for the duration of the war.The drama starts when a German music teacher who is an expatriot and his wife are taken away and his wife dies of an heart attack.The murder of a German woman who is married to a magistrate andhas escaped being sent to the camp is the subject of this episode.The acting and script writing are very good hereand the look at WWII Britain is nice.
1,Mega-Sound equipment,Did not even get a chance to hear the sound. It broke as I was taking it out of box.
3,Great product !,I am very satisfied with this megaphone. For the price you can't beat it . Delivery was also fast .
4,IT works!,"The charger works great and charges quickly. Shipping was also quick (3-4 days) My only complaint is that sometime it is hard to get into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long, wish it was longer."
4,Around the world.,Things you will neve seen unless you go to different parts of the world. Some strange sites rarelly senn elswhere.
3,Indigo Controller,"The controller got to me quickly, however, it wasn't purple it was black. I'm glad to have it either way, and gamecube is a great gaming system, but I ordered an indigo controller. It's really annoying that I didn't get what I paid for."
4,"Leaves feet soft, but greasy!","I use my tube of burts bees coconut foot creme once in awhile. I would say, dont let the name fool you. It's not very ""creamy"", more like a salve in my opinion.It reminds me of heavily scented petroleum jelly. The coconut smell is minty too, but not unpleasant. Noticeable from a far. I only use this creme at night.I found it didnt absorb fast, and left my feet feeling greasy & sticky until I wiped it off. However, it did leave my feet soft and smooth. I suppose if you don't mind doing a spa day with this you might enjoy it. I would not suggest putting it on and then placing socks on.Because it works so well at moisturizing my feet I only deducted one star for the actual feeling and strong scent of the creme. It's hard to find good products for feet, and this one is pretty good at the job it is supposed to do."
5,Works well,Better then lotion. Its a bit messy and the instructions tell you to put it on and then socks over it. You need to because it takes a while for it to soak in and stays moist. I use this when I need something more to work on the tougher areas.
1,very disappointed,"If you are looking for the original burts bees version of this product(the one shown in the photo... metal tube, actually has peppermint in it) do not order here, while the photo shows the older product in the recyclable metal tube what they will send is the new formulation of the product which has no peppermint(mind you the maker did not change the product description on the package) and now has soap nut oil??don't bother contacting amazon b/c when i contacted them prior to ordering i was told the product shown in the photo would be what i was sentif i had wanted to new inferior stuff id have bought it locally for a better price!!"
2,disappointed,I like Burt's Bees products because they are natural and was hoping for good results with this foot cream. I don't think I would be purchasing it again. I did not find that it helped a whole bunch on softening my feet as much as I would have liked.
4,The Best Smelling Foot Cream Ever!,"This foot cream smells great and relaxes my feet after a hard day at work. For the price, you can't do better."
1,Did i step in bubble gum bare footed?,"I bought this lotion because it says all natural ingredients and nothing harmful, I love natural ingredient skin care !I liked the old fashion like tube,& really nice coconut scent... but as i started to put it on my feet, this foot ""cream"" was like sticky syrup..my feet felt soo gross and sticky, The tube says put on socks afterwards and so I did, thinking : maybe in the morning the results will be nice soft feet, like the testimonals I have read.. In the morning, I removed my socks and my feet were sticking to my rug,and kitchen floor, I tried to slough off this substance from my feet and big waxx balls of this stuff was all over -everywhere in a huge mess. I ended up scrubbing it off (i mean really scrubbing, it was hard to remove!) After that my feet were sore as ever ,red and scratched,IMO I would not buy again nor recomend."
3,"Loved, Loved, Loved until it Broke (much sooner than expected)","Loved the phone but parts of it are very poorly constructed. The little piece that allows you to wear it on just your ear instead of the whole headset broke within the first few weeks. I contacted the company and they refused to replace. The rest of the headset broke beyond repair after about a year... and that is just from normal use. I never dropped it or was aware of anything that could damage it.Other than that, I LOVED the phone. I spend a lot of time on the phone and the wireless aspect was great. People could hear me as if I wasn't using a headset and I got all the benefits of hands free. Still when it went, I replaced with a different phone and a corded headset because this unit costs way too much to have it only last 1 year."
1,Nearly Non-functional,"I ordered this for use in my home office. Minor problems from the start: it goes through an ""INITIALIZATION"" process sometimes. Often right when I need it to answer the phone. It continued going through spurts of switching between working and not working. I moved to a place where there is no phone jack in my office, so I figured I could connect it to the nearest one, about 40' away. Total failure at this point. It doesn't connect from that far.Then last night, it just started chirping and buzzing incessantly unless I pull the battery out. Which prompted me to write this review and start trying to figure out how to return it."
1,"This phone has great potential, but falls short for me","I office out of my house and have always struggled to find a good, reasonably priced on-ear headset for my office line. Because of the built-in wireless headset, this system looked like exactly what I needed. I have been using the headset for about 8 months and the voice quality is good. I bought this system for the over ear headset. When I took it out of the box, I immediately noticed that the earloop is seemed very flimsy/cheap. Sure enough it broke within a month of use. The online store where I bought it was nice enough to replace the entire unit. However, the next loop broke in 45 days (and I was being VERY careful with it). The problem may be that the ear piece is somewhat heavy. After all, it does have a battery and phone built-in.The bad news is that they do not make replacement parts for this unit and it is unusable for me in its current state. I cannot recommend a product that the manufacturer does not stand behind."
3,"Nice phone, short battery life","The good: This is the only phone I've been able to find that has a truly cordless headset. Sound is good, mic pickup is clear.The bad: Phone directory doesn't have a search option & doesn't have the ability to sort entries by name/phone #. I've also had an ongoing problem with battery life on the handset: when the handset is disconnected from the base station for more than 5 minutes or so the phone drops the call and displays an ""initialization"" message. As long as the phone is plugged into the base, though, it works fine."
5,Hearing Disabled,"I have Tinnitus real bad, and I have a lot of problem hearing a Blue Tooth type headset. I found myself cupping one hand over the thing all the time trying to rear. I bought this because it fits tight over my ear, and it has not disappointed me. My first one lasted three years, and I use it all day six days a week. I pace as I talk in my home office, and the wireless headset gives me the freedom to do anything and still be on the phone. The second one I purchased had the headset knocked off my desk while in the charger and it broke the headset itself. I was not able to find a replacement part from the RCA website, so I purchased another one that had been a display for a reasonable price, and I may use the other parts as a backup in case the first goes bad. I see where others do not like the sound quality, but with my hearing, what is most important is that I can hear it. I would find my job much harder to do if it were not for this phone."
4,One of my granddaughter's favorite Christmas presents,"My granddaughters got a Boston Terrier puppy last year. They love him dearly but he would get wild and jump on the two year old. So I wanted to buy her a stuffed version of her dog. She loved her ""quiet"" puppy and took him to bed with her. This is one time we wanted a toy that doesn't do anything but sit there."
3,Cute Dog,I bought this for my dog and she bit through it the first day. Great product but not for dogs.
1,Front legs are too short!,The dog doesn't (can't) sit. It wasn't a fluke either. I order two! Both front legs were too short! So annoying!
2,Worked awesome until it snapped in half,"Was thrilled with this press, then it snapped in half about 3 months after we bought it. Made from some sort of cheap metal material. Not worth it, buy a stainless steel one."
2,Loved it at first but...,"We bought it because we read good reviews about it. Initially we loved how easily we can mince up garlic. Cleanup is a bit of a hassle, we usually push out the pulp with a stiff brush before putting it in the dishwasher. However, the finish started dulling and flaking off after a while and we are now looking for a replacement. I won't buy this again, nor the other Zyliss because of the flaking."
3,Works well but big issues,"As others have stated, it works well. However, the finish comes off after time and it's incredibly difficult to clean. I'd look for one that comes with a cleaning tool."
4,A Jewish Boys Hardships,"Mark Seltzer is a twelve year old boy who is going through preparing for his Bar Mitzvah and playing on his mom's baseball team. Mark loves playing baseball, but he has a hard time in Hebrew school and his social life because he has to worry about so many things. I liked this book because it show what hardships Mark has to overcome in preparing for his Bar Mitzvah and still have a fun time. I also liked this book because it had a lot of baseball in it and I love baseball."
3,Why can't this subscription start earlier??,I am not happy that there is such a LONG wait for my subscription to get started. Is this a problem with Amazon.com? I've already paid in full - Why must I wait two months to get my first copy?
3,it's so sturdy that it's too heavy,"i really, really, really wanted to like this product. i first expected a flat front because i want to drag straight across the surface on my cast-iron skillet. well, the front is slightly curved, though that might be better for strictly flipping. but the biggest problem is that because it's so hefty, it's quite heavy. it's probably fine for occasional flipping, but since i use to saute and hold it for a while, the weight can tire your arm. this thing is very solid!so i'm back to looking for a lighter stainless steel cooking utensil."
1,Flat Foot Insole fell flat.,"These insoles did not do the job for me, but everybody has different feet, so my opinion really just applies to my experience with them. I have 9 1/2 size feet, a less pronouced arch, and wear size ten shoes. For me they were hard, uncomfortable, and caused my foot to lean laterally within each shoe, so I won't be using them. I found the Sof Sole Men's Air Lightweight Insole Shoe to be the best for my feet."
5,Solid strap!,"The look of this strap caught my eye, I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well. The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud. Strong build, sort of a double layered nylon strap, and nice thick leather for the ends(one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new, but it should be easier with some wear). Easy to adjust, comfortable. I think that with many things you get what you pay for, and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get."
4,Great Quality,I purchased this to complete my set and I am very pleased witht the quality. It was almost brand new and the only blemish I found was the old sticker saying it was no longer a library book
5,"High Quality 18/10 Stainless Steel - Functional Design, Fine Craftsmanship","All-Clad Stainless Pasta LadleThis highly polished, handsome, 18/10 Stainless Steel pasta ladle is of excellent quality - fine craftsmanship, is very durable - built to last lifetimes, food grade, non-leaching, and a safe metal alloy especially, when preparing, and handling cooked or heated food.I really like this since it is a tool that helps you quickly transfer very hot pasta and lots of it from a pan to a serving dish to pasta bowls, and/or storage containers. It's heavy construction is perfect for balancing the weight of pasta, which many can appreciate, and I also like that it can be placed on a hook to keep on display when not in use.Treat yourself or a loved one to higher quality, sustainable, reusable, handsome product, and you won't regret it, other than why didn't you do it sooner! Hope that this helps."
5,Best pasta ladle,This is a high quality pasta ladle that is worth the money. It has that slightly heavy feel which in this case means quality and looks really nice too. It is worth it to get this all-clad pasta ladle instead of a cheap knock off from a bed bath and beyond store. I like quality and knowing that my money is going to last. This product meets all of my expectations.
4,Silver - the Ultimate Beauty!,"I am thrilled to know there are other fans of this band! And everyone has done the same thing I did - wear out the vinyl until it was completely unplayable. I saw the band with friends when they opened for J. Geils Band at Wake Forest University. All of us were simply overwhelmed and completely obsessed with the band after that. I have been looking for some mention, some musical scrap of their music for over 30 years. I recently did find this web site [...] which has snippets of the songs we are totally addicted to.This album is a beginning - but PLEASE re-release SILVER!!!!Yearning in NC."
2,Not that good,"SILVER is far superior to this album. I had to go to the trouble of finding SILVER on e-bay then having it transfered to CD. (My old copy had no grooves left, I'd played it so much.) Like the other reviewer I am flummoxed as to why this album has been re-released and not SILVER. The songs fall way short on this one."
4,Expedient Delivery,"I was told by amazon that the earliest I would receive these was going to be on the 20th, but I received them today, the 19th. They are a little smaller than I thought they would, but overall I am happy. I have very sensitive ears. They puss out and swell up, but I have had these in for a good six hours and my ears are doing perfectly. Usually they start swelling up within half an hour. They are also really beautiful! I love them!"
2,Not as strong as I expected,My Catholic friend seemed to like it OK. I didn't think the recording was done very well. It droned on to me. Not as fantastic and varied as I would have liked. Enjoyed Boston Pops Christmas CD much more.
3,An accesible Siouxie release,"This later CD of the beloved Siouxie and the Banshees shows the diversity that the band has. Peepshow, a deliciously original dance song,and the love ballad Last Beat of My Heart, show how great they are. While listening to this, you are whirled through a tornado of emotions along with Siouxie Sioux. Though not the best release of the Banshees, it is a very good one to start with. And for a long time fan, it is another wonderful dose of Ms. Sioux. Enjoy."
3,3 1/2 Stars.,"Peep Show sounds like an 18th century Victorian horror soundtrack married with 1980s pop aesthetics. Because the production here is so streamlined, the album only just manages to reproduce the nervy angst typical of the Banshees' style, even though ite tempered with the addition of dance beats and a new found dash of sentimentality in some songs. The album comes near to failing but almost always pulls itself together, except on 'Peek-a-Boo' which, probably because it is just basically 4 minutes of drum machine, falls completely flat on its face."
2,Not that good,"I was disappointed by this movie. It could have been an interesting documentary, but wasn't. At times, there seemed to be some attempt at humor, but it wasn't funny. The final scenes, of children suffering set to cheesy music, I thought were insensitive and inappropriate."
4,Great Product!,"I looked at a lot of cart covers before purchasing this one, I wanted something that was somewhat gender-neutral in case we have a boy next time. The colors are a little brighter than shown in the photo, and the bluish color is more purple, but my husband said he wouldn't be embarrassed to have a boy in it, so I guess it would work for either a boy or girl!The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that when I washed it for the first time, some of the stuffing inside shifted and made it sort of lumpy. I didn't dry it at all, and washed it per the instructions. Also, the carrying bag that it comes with is very cute, but it is pretty tough to get the cover to fold all the way back up and fit in the bag. I usually just throw the cover in the back of the car without putting it in the bag.I love how this product covers all of the shopping cart, and the loops for toys are great. I would definitely recommend this, just be careful when washing!"
3,Does the job,"This seat cover does the job fairly well. It covers all the germy areas well. However, it is a bit cumbersome. Attaching it to the seat with a child in your arms is not easy and forget about packing it up afterwards in the cute little bag. The attached toys are nice and the loops allow you to attach some of your own as well. I will continue to use mine now, but I see myself deciding that it's just too much work once my baby stops putting his mouth on everything in sight."
4,Pleased...,"This product is well worth the money. The quality is fantastic.. I read other reviews prior to buying this item and the only thing I would say is it is girley. I have a son and thought this would be ok for either a boy or a girl but there is definately a strong ""violet"" color on this seat cover. I thought it was more Blueish but its not. Awesome product for a baby girl...not my pick for a baby boy though."
1,U-G-L-Y,"I am rating this a one because of the color. I am sure that this seat cover would work wonderfully, however the color is so disgusting that I had to return it. The color in the picture is not a good representation of the ACTUAL color. It really a disgusting baby poop green!. Believe me, I am not all that into style but I thought that it looked modern and neutral in the picture and would be a little less loud than the others but eeewwww."
4,Tambourine,I bought this for my fiancee to take to church. It's the kind of church they play lots of gospel. It fits nicely in her purse and sounds great in the crowd in church against the music. Sounds hollow at home with no other sound but sounds great with music. Very satisfied for the money. Nice wood frame.
5,Great Stainless Steel Utensil Set,"After searching everywhere for utensils and reading reviews, I decided to pay the extra dollars and get this set..Very happy with purchase..they are heavy and so shiny..Proud to display them out on countertop.."
2,marred by poor singing,"not a good recording. The singing is really not at the level that one would expect on a professional recording. several of the singers have very noticeable wobbles. there is another recording of this opera that came out of bologna, i've never heard it, but i would give that one a try before this one."
1,Two #6 DVD'S??? /Cry NO #7,"I received two #6's in my box set and no #7. Very disappointing considering there is only #5, 6 and 7 in the entire set. Pretty big Screw up."
5,Pump It UP!,"I've gotta agree with the previous reveiwer's suspicions of ""Pump"". I also thought that the only really good songs on the album would be the ""big three"" (Janie, Elevator, and The Other Side), but boy was I wrong about this monumental Aerosmith album. Of course this isn't meant to knock the hits, hey they're ""hits"" for a reason, right? ""The Other Side""'s crammed with some heavy duty riffing remniscent of ""Mama Kin"" and ""Love in an Elevator"" has the best hook of all time (I just love Joey's double bass stomp at that part of the song!). However, ""Janie's Got a Gun"" is still the killer - even after almost ten years! The boys were in rare form when they recorded that one!! The rest of the tunes on ""Pump"" hold their own against the hits - especially ""F.I.N.E"" and ""My Girl"". Finish all this off with ""What it Takes"" (one of the few 90's Aerosmith ballads that actually works), and you've got yourself a bonafide winner from the Boston Bad Boys!!"
5,holy sweet mother of oblivion!,"this controller is soooo awesome. it is ergonomicly designed so well that you can hardly even feel that it is there. after an all nighter playing super monkey ball (get that game), my hands didnt gt tired once. also, the built in rumble feature is so comfy, it is relaxing when it engages. its faint hum is just so cool!! even if you just slammed into a wall or something and died (in the game of course."
2,Not to be watched from beginning to end,"Although this movie provides a very profound and new way of looking at old architecture, it is not something that one can sit through for a long and extensive period of time. I don't believe that it is a movie that was intended as such. Rather, I think that the film maker intended the movie to be seen as part of an installation in a museum."
1,Poor Product,This watch was sold as NEW and appeared to be new except for the box which showed extreme wear. The watch did not keep time and when observed the second hand actually stopped for several seconds at a time. It lost 40 minutes a day. I bought another identical one at WalMart and it acted the same same way! I put a new battery in the one I purchased form Amazon and the jeweler and I watched it continue to act the same way. Don't take a chance on this one!!!!
3,know your wife?,"the plot is a little bit weird, as is the case always with D. but at the same time it is his most interesting one. a woman dies, and ha husband realizes how little he knows about her. she has had a secret life. he becomes a suspect in the murder investigation following her death. a vissit to a psychologist makes him doubt his own sanity. this is a good read, but you must realize that D's plot development may be a bit strange"
2,9 inch locking tongs- not easy to use,"I bought these tongs when I purchased an all-clad master chef pot set. All-clad is a great name and the product in made in the USA. I have used tongs to cook and serve for many years. I find that these are a bit clumsy to use and do not pick up the food well in the pan or from a cutting board. In addition, they are heavy and the locking mechnanism and spring are not well constructed and have a tendency to lock when using or unlock if moved, while they are stored. There are less expensive tongs on the market that are a better buy."
2,too stiff and no grip,"I don't know what these are supposed to be used for, but they're not very good for anything I've tried them on.There's a spring at the hinge that is really stiff and rough when you close the tongs. The gripping surface on the tongs is so smooth that they just don't 'grip' anything! These tongs have been sent to my kitchen junk drawer.They're very beautiful of course (it's allclad...), but don't even waste your money on this shiny piece of junk."
1,These tongs are horrible,"The worst tongs ever. They are well made, pretty to look at but have zero function. They do not grip food; they bend in the middle, and are completely useless in the kitchen. All-Clad should be ashamed of their selves putting out such a horrible product. I would NEVER recommend these to anyone, unless you feel like dropping food all of the time. Seriously I think a cheap pair of good grips OXO tongs are much better. Why can't anyone make perfect kitchen tongs?!"
2,"Beautiful, but not so useful","These are really quite beautiful and well made tongs. The finish and weight are first rate. The problem is, at least on the set that I bought, that the spring rate is too high. I found them fatiguing after a very short period of use, and it's not as though I lack hand strength.In contrast, I recently bought a set of the Oxo tongs, and they are much, much more usable. Not quite as nicely finished, but they also lock and are sprung much better. I think they were a bit less expensive as well."
1,Not worth it!,"I'm an All-Clad fanatic. I have their pots and pans, their measuring cups, and most of my cooking utensils are All-Clad. All of them have exceeded my expectations in its quality, design, and utility, except this one. Thank goodness I didn't pay for them (I got this as a bonus gift to buying bunch of other All-Clad pots and pans) b/c unlike other All-Clads, they are NOT worth the price! The locking mechanism is not designed well -it takes a little more effort than my other tongs to lock and unlock during cooking, which might not seem much, but it becomes a huge nusiance when you use it as much as me. But what's most disappointing is that the end of the tongs are so flat (my other tongs curve inward slightly so that it will hold onto food better) that unless I use extra force to hold onto the food, it just slips out (talk about hands cramping!). Like others have commented here, it looks beautiful, but in terms of getting things done in the kitchen, it fails miserably."
5,"Atomic Rooster - 'First Ten Explosive Years,Volume 2' (Angel Air)","Another fantastic compilation of Atomic Rooster's repertoire.Only,this 18 track CD is all with the stunning guitarist/vocalist(one of rock's true best vocalists of all time,in my humble opinion)John DuCann,from his two stays in the band,1970-72 and 1979-82.Believe me,when he wasn't there,Rooster should've maybe stayed in bed that day.CD title says it all.Really,not one bad cut on the entire disc.Top of the line British '70's heavy rock to be fully experienced within.With tunes like ""Do You Know Who's looking For You?"",""Watch Out!"",the bootie-kicking ""Friday The 13th"",""Nobody Else"",the nearly insane ""I Can't Stand It"" and so on.Highly recommended."
5,Breath Practice Demystified,"Clearly written and very readable, the focus of this book is not on esoteric breathing excercises but on remembering and relearning the deep, smooth, easy breath we had as children. With lots of explication and diagrams for the analytical among us, and many postures, excercises and meditations to try, this book offers good advice on how to identify and remove habitual stress patterns that encourage shallow or restricted breathing. The last two chapters- ""The shared breath - Inquiries for couples"" and ""Minding the Breath - Cultivating Mindfulness"" were definitely my favorites."
5,Breath of Life,"Donna Farhi has done a wonderful job here explaining the common habitual breathing mistakes many people adopt and how to reverse the habit. We tend to trivialize the imprtance of breathing correctly and yet it is the very mechanism that can transform the way we think and therefore the way we act. It does have alot of information in it but 'Rome was not built in a day', and most of us have spent a lifetime cultivating a strange breathing pattern that causes gripping in the body and mind. This book is great for the yoga student and teacher but also to anyone else, as we all need to breathe be it on a sticky mat or not.The anatomy of breathing was very useful, as was the section on dismantling the incorrect pattern. Camella Nair - Author of ""Aqua Kriya Yoga""."
5,Mystic Island is unlike any album you've ever heard.,"From the extraordinarily dynamic Fox and the Lady, to the enchanting tear-jerking Lonely Rose, this is instrumental music that would have surprised the great classical composers themeselves. However, this is far from classical music. Each song is completely uniqie. While I thought the constant guitar in the song Leo (in some parts) was mixed in at slightly too high a volume, a good DSP (digital signal processing) reciever can easily change this. However, this is not a flaw as some may find the volume generous and necessary. In no way does this ditract any of the rating, 5 very bright stars!"
5,A good book by my favorite author.,"Running From Safety really is an adventure of the spirt. It's about having an open mind, and asking yourself what it would be like to go back to when you were ten years old. To know how your life has gone and to help yourself grow up"
1,Not all it's thought to be,"This computer was not compatible with my wireless network and I needed to buy an upgrade in order to do it, so I just returned it"
5,Tabletop Music Stand Convenience,"I love this stand. I just took it on a trip to various locations around the U.S. and it worked flawlessly each time. The size of this stand when folded allows for easy storage in a suitcase. All you need is the stand and a flat surface and you are ready to go. The stand is well constructed, sturdy and easily adjusted."
5,a great little stand,"I like the fact that you can put it away, actually fold it up. I like the way it stands up on any table or surface, even my electronic keyboard surface. It just comes in very handy for those moments you need to have some sheet music or lyrics in front of you."
2,"Audio version, ugh.","I bought the audio version read by Dick Hill, and I think I could tell that this is another great book from Dave Barry. But Dick Hill's reading voice is wrong, all wrong. He is SUCH a distraction from the content of the book. I had to give up after about 10 minutes. He constantly plays with his voice and does all these stupid inflections as though he's reading to a child. It's awful, simply awful. I hope that next time Dave's publisher will choose a voice that doesn't constantly interfere with the content."
1,Used daily and metal failed,"I used this chair daily as a replacement for my office chair. The thin metal tubing failed after 6 months. If you are using this frequently, I would purchase a more expensive chair."
2,Not Impressed One Little Bit,"InStep Massage ChairI really was not impressed with this chair. It was difficult to tighten the chair enough where the face cradle wouldn't fall, and the screw to raise the face cradle wouldn't hold, so the face crardle would only stay in one position - the lowest position. The chair was very loose. I don't think it will hold with multiple customers getting on and off."
1,Missing Hooks and Hardware,"The ad for this product clearly says it contains hooks and hardware.""Product FeaturesSix detachable hooks includedMounting hardware included""We saw some complaints that people received the item without hooks and hardware, but assumed they were flukes. We ordered 2 and sure enough, no hooks or hardware. We sent for a replacement, saying that the hooks and hardware weren't included. Today we got a replacement set - no hooks, no hardware. I would suggest you don't bother ordering this."
4,all clad utensil rack,A good well made item. Matches the other two we already have. Well made and attractive
1,Pointless blaxploitation/horror hybrid,"In this film directed by William A. Levey (also guilty of directing the classics Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman and Skatetown, U.S.A.), ""Dr. Stein"" replaces the arms and legs of a black Vietnam vet named Eddie, but something goes wrong and Eddie becomes a murdering, rampaging monster. This low-budget mess is long on phony-looking gore, but short on plot. If you're interested in blaxploitation/horror hybrids like this, check out the vastly superior ""Blacula"" instead.One-half star out of five."
4,friendship and kindness,"This is a timeless story of kindness and friendship. A bird flies into a window and encounters a hungry, lonely fish in a fishbowl. He then leaves and goes and finds a worm and brings it back. Then he divides up the worm with his new friend the fish and they both are happy.This wordless book is done in a lovely watercolor style.The themes are ones that any parent would appreciate as values to teach their kids--helping, friendship, sharing and caring."
4,will do for now,"The book became a cause celebre when Salinger himself came out of hiding in 1984 to challenge Hamilton's right to quote from his unpublished letters, and his suit was upheld on appeal. The book, already in galleys, had to be rewritten and none of the trove of material that Hamilton had uncovered could be used. So what we're left with is a sketchy biography, that only goes up to 1965, the date of Salinger's last publication (""Hapworth 16, 1924""-the long story that's supposed to be republished as a book one of these years). But most anyone interested in Salinger will enjoy reading this book regardless. It's well written, objective, often funny, and creates a believable picture of the man. The definitive biography will be some time in coming-the outstanding question, of course, is what has he written (and saved) since 1965-but if you're looking for SOMETHING new about Salinger in the meantime, this is well worth your time."
2,Wanted To Love It - Couldn't,"I love Nigerian literature and music, so I approached this book with a sense of excitement.And ""GraceLand"" almost worked, but I couldn't connect with the characters. Elvis, his father, the King of Beggars... all of them were colorful, but none of them rang true."
3,A look at Nigeria and it's children,"Since I don't know much about Nigeria, Mr. Abani gave me a bit of insight on what it might be like to grow up and live there. Like most middle class families, I didn't have a clue and once I began to read and really envision this life, it was devastating to picture.While Graceland did drag in places, I found it very well written and the things that it was trying to get across important. And as I worked my way to the end, I was biting my nails to see how this would end.Overall not my favorite Today Show book club pick, Graceland was worth the time I put into reading it by far. I'd recommend it to a friend."
2,It was fun while it lasted!,"This memory card is a very small and compact device. Now you would think that smaller is better, but it's not. It runs out of space fairly quickly, and is 15 bucks a piece, so I would buy more than one at a time."
3,Memory Card 59 Too Small....,"If you play RPG'S where you do a lot of saving or if you play lots of different games, this memory card is too small."
2,Way too small,"I bought this card for the obvious reason of needing to save my games. I was disappointed to find out just how little the card held. I played Super Smash and saved my game, only a few blocks were used, no argument. But when I put in my Madden 2002, the 1st thing i saw was that to save a franchise would take up 59 blocks, a whole card! I also have a PS2, and my 8mb memory card is currently holding about 10 different games, including 2 football franchises and is just over half full. While this card is very inexpensive, I would gladly have forked over twice as much for a larger memory card."
4,"Solid, but slight flaws in finish.","As with all Baldwin hardware, this door knocker is solid and substantial. I bought this satin nickel knocker 9 years after buying a satin nickel lock set for my door. The finish matches perfectly. I took off one star for slight flaws in the finish, and because Baldwin does not include any kind of installation instructions or template for drilling. I have moderate carpentry skills, but really could have used a paper template like the ones they include with deadbolts and handle sets. This requires two drill bit sizes because part of the faceplate of the knocker needs to be countersunk into the door, with a hole bigger than the screw size. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, but it was a little scary drilling into my door and hoping that I was doing it correctly."
4,"Not the best, but still good","This whisk has a nice weight. As with all things All-Clad, the quality is excellent, clean up is easy and it's sturdy. My complaint is that because of the way the handle is made, it's not comfortable for extended use. For example, I love to use it to whisk polenta into boiling water or to quickly mix dry ingredients. I hate to use it for whipping egg whites or cream. Then again, I rarely whip eggs or cream by hand anymore."
1,ONE PAGE of very basic info.,"I can't believe I paid cash for this EXTREMELY basic one page overview of PTZ types. If this is what the rest of the series is like, and I suspect it is, don't waste your money. I can't believe that Amazon.com would rip me off like this."
2,Well.........,"It's not an almanac, which is what I wanted. Looks new, but smells old. I want to use the book, but everytime I open the book the smell makes me close it. Hope it goes away eventually."
4,useful for medical students !,"a very good book, easily readable, to learn all techniques of a complete physical examination. The text is concise, with all informations we need, and there are a lot of illustrations which make the physical examination easy to perform."
3,It's good if you really want to go deep into every grain,"It's a heavy, big book. It goes real deep into explanation and stories about every grain and grain. If this is would you are looking for then go for it."
1,Disappointing,"I expected some simpler Southern cooking because of the title. The recipes might have came from California instead from Atlanta. No thanks, this isn't Southern fixin's."
4,Good - not great.,"I just wanted a basic protein that wasn't crazy expensive.Universal is a solid brand. It comes in a large bag (not the tub show).The closure on the bag wears out after a week, so I poured it into an old Muscle Milk tub.The taste isn't great, but that's because there's less carbs than most - and that's what I was looking for.Better taste or better price and I'd give you 5 stars."
5,A Really Good Book,"This book really reads fast, the only thing that slowed me down was that I kept telling my wife bits from the pages. When the attack took place the author does a great job of making you see the full event? I do not even remember hearing much about this in the past but here are all the facts. It really makes the hardened cockpit doors look like a long overdue idea. Sometimes with airline books you get a lot of pilot speak that is hard to understand but not here - the author does a great job of explaining everything, almost like if he were with you in the living room while you read. You also really get to feel for the victims of this madman. You do not have to be interested in airlines to get a lot out of this book; it is just an overall great read."
4,Heroic Story of Bravery,"If you work for FedEx or know someone who does this is a great story. It's about a man who attempted to hijack a FedEx plane and run it into the Memphis, TN FedEx Hub. It's the story of the heroic crew that attempted to take him down. My husband and I both work for FedEx so we are looking forward to reading this book. We have heard good things about it."
5,Captivating,"From the first chapter, Cross Currents captured my attention and gave me a ""down memory lane"" sail. I dropped my things to do list and devoured each page and minute detail."
5,Great book!,I had never heard of Christine Kling but this was a great book. Would defiantly read her again. Packed with lots of adventure.
5,she's my heroine,A good quick paced mystery and action adventure story. The characters come alive with Ms kling's quick wit and narrative. I will read alll her books.
3,Cross Current,Maybe if I was a boating fan I could have given this book more stars but the author's tendency to over describe boats and boating lead me to a lot of skimming. The overall plot was good even if predictable. I did not like BJ and wonder if I missed something since I did not read book 1 that actually made him more than cardboard.
2,Great,"Very good,this kept me wanting more. Could not wait to see what happens next. Very excited to read the next one in the series."
2,Overrated,"I don't understand the fascination with All Clad products. While I like the turner part of this fish turner, it has THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HANDLE of any tool in my kitchen. What is All Clad thinking? Don't their designers ever use their equipment."
5,magnificent,"If I would be forced to select the best music in the world, secret story album would do it by a far margin. I saw Metheny in his secret story tour in Caracas in 1995, since then every time I go in the weekends to the ""llanos"" in Venezuela, many things can be forgotten (Towels, booze, cuban cigars) but my boom box and secret stoy are always there. Best enjoyed in a clear moonless night, with good company, and of course with a cuban cigar and a black label!. I simply find it as inspiring as the first time I heard it. dont live home without it."
5,Excellent Analysis of Totalitarianism,"This book is a pleasure to read: Conquest's fluid writing style absorbs the reader's attention. One of the heavyweight historians of the 20th century, his analysis of the nightmare utopias of communism and Nazism is unparallelled. As the century ends, no book better reflects on its dark side, and yet holds out the promise of cultural renewal and the fostering of democratic values."
3,Tiresome slog,"I could not agree more with Conquest about the implications and legacy of the 'great' messianic ideologies of the 20th century - but this book neither illuminates nor entertains. It's more like an opinionated rant from a drunken (though very erudite) dinner guest. Apoplectic, scattershot, and ultimately tiresome.Do not expect to see the contested ideas given a level-headed airing, and then dispatched with careful analysis. Here, Conquest is editorializing in hopelessly convoluted language against caricatures of ideas he can't stand - the tone is one of impatient irritation.Given that Conquest admits this book is general reading, not scholarship (hence no footnotes, etc), one would have hoped for a strong editor to streamline the text to pack a stronger punch.As it stands, it is indeed ""tough sledding"" and ""a bit hard to unpack on first reading"", as another review noted."
2,Not quite what I expected,"These sandals looked like ones that I have had in the enjoyed in the past. For such a fantastic price, I figured that I had to take a chance on it. Well, it looked similar to the ones I had but it was made of much cheaper material. I returned them. I am still looking for well-made massaging sandals that don't cost $90."
5,Great stuff,"I had the album years ago but lost it once I upgraded to CD, it is nice to have a copy of this once again."
1,Schlock!,"Seals and Crofts made 1 album worth listening to--their second, titled ""Down Home"" (TA Records #TA 5004, distributed by Bell Records, 1970, I think.) I can hear all the S&C fans out there going, ""Hunh? Never heard of it..."" Actually, it's much better than just ""worth listening to."" It's a great record. It sounds nothing like the over-produced AM radio garbage they're known for. The songs are unforgettable and the playing by the studio musicians is out of this world. John Hall (who also played on a lot of Bonnie Raitt's older albums and eventually fell from grace as leader of Orleans) lets loose one of the best guitar solos ever put on vinyl on the song ""Leave"". If you want to feel terrible about a S&C record not being available on CD, make it this one. I have exactly 5 lp records that I'm still hanging on to, down from a collection of thousands, and ""Down Home"" is one of them."
3,Seals and Crofts,Compilation is OK; I have a hard time understanding why Get Closer was not added?? I think it was a Mistake to omit it...
5,I love this shawl.,Extremely beautiful shawl. Much nicer than i anticipated. I will definitely order another one for myself and as a gift.
5,Very good quality,Color and texture is lovely. I will probably order more in different colors. I think it's ridiculous that this survey requires I use 16 words to be able to submit
4,Wearing it right now!,"Ok, so I was a bit worried that this Pashmina would be too small as I am not a stick figure size but I wanted to fit the way it does on the mannequin pictured: it does! The color is as pictured & for the price I a very happy with this product! I highly recommended & I will likely buy more colors & use as inexpensive gifts."
3,A rating for pocket folders...,"A decent price, I guess. These are black folders (matte) with the little cut-outs to stick business cards. A one time purchase, nothing big."
3,You definitely need some experience before reading this book,"I am not experienced in acupressure and find this book completely perplexing. It's like a puzzle I haven't figured out yet. I don't feel that it is very user-friendly as it has you flipping here and there and everywhere for a single ailment. I also couldn't figure out whether I needed to rub all of the points, some of them, etc. The text is interesting, but there isn't enough clear text about navigating the book itself."
2,A Lamb in Wolf's Clothing,"The cover would lead you to believe this film is about a man who has numerous options of female love interests. The fact that a man is the lead is meant to be deceptive too. THIS IS A CHICK FLICK!!!! Don't be deceived! The whole film is obsessed with: Will I get married? How will my partner and I resolve a fight? Do my parents like my partner? Will this dinner designed for couples go well. It's also hard to watch because the main character is so unique. Slotnick has a long oval face, a receding hairline, and layers of coarsely curled hair. I mean, he's not Steve Buscemi, but he's no Jude Law either! If you like chick flicks, then you will enjoy this. However, if you hate that genre, then it will be obvious how you will respond to this film."
1,afraid to buy cds at amazon,"i have expressed my review for the purchased items from amazon.what made you rereview,rerereview ??if something go amiss, i want to express my opinion.return-fee on you, i will return the love me tender cd (defective item) to you. it's reasonable,i think.please send me return-fee to me.as soon as i get it, let me return it.and you can confirm that it's defective or not.to be frank with you, i""m afraid to buy cds at amazon."
5,a review from chile and u.s.a,"i'm from chile and i bought this cd on march 2002(when i was in chile) 'cause of his participation in the festival Vina del mar, where he had an incredible success thanks to the lirycs and his powerfull songs about his live in chile and swedden.now i live in Los Angeles, CA. U.S.A, and my roommates loves this cd, 'cause they like the latin hip hop he makes, so i realise that dj. mendez is a singer who with this very good album can have success in america like he had in europe and latinamerica including chile, 'cause the people in chile didn't know him until august 2001 when he arrived to chile for first time since he left the country when he was a child.well, as a sumary... latino for life is an album for all the people who likes different kind of music and people who likes the mix latin and hip-hop."
1,Sorry but...,"...I didn't like it. I think I got mislead by a news report, thinking that it was dance-oriented, I should have known... If you're a hip-hop fan, and moreover, a Spanish-language hip-hop fan, you're gonna love it. Otherwise, stay away."
5,Excellent for a beginer,"We have started doing some drawing and sketching for the fun of it, and found this book to be a wonderful help for drawing the characters from Finding Nemo. Our granndaughter is very fond of the movie and likes to do her own sketches. Highly recommend the book for someone who knows just a little about drawing."
4,A tough discussion about a very tough subject,"I think that Dan Allender is a genius for a few reasons. One I think that he dares the reader to stretch beyond their own pain and peer deeply into the worst part of their lives. He uses this as a prescription for healing and carefully guides the readers into that chasm of life's trouble. I also think that this book encourages the reader to label some of the ugly, nasty stuff that goes along with sexual abuse. He gives women a voice to express the anger, pain and frustrations associated with abuse."
3,Learn about Reps with a flavor of editorial bias,"Novick digs into the do's and don'ts of selling through independent reps (his title is aptly used). Instead of focusing solely on the virtues of independent reps and how to implement their use into a marketing plan, he develops a kind of arguement of independent reps vs. direct selling. At each turn, instead of just giving a straight and open picture, he spends time exploring the pros and cons of both direct sales and reps. I think he made his case well in the first chapter, but he keeps revisiting the main argument, causing me to think that one of his book's main thesis' is, ""Why independent reps are more effective than a direct sales force."" Considering where his background is, one can easily see his bias.Despite these marginal qualities, Novick possesses a great store of knowledge, which he gives to the reader of how to find, attract, and keep superior reps. Overall, a good book for the inquisitive marketer, but some parts are worth glossing over."
4,Solid!,"I love my bat. I bought it for personal reasons, not to actually play cricket, so I don't know how it well it works for a game, but I do know it works great for smashing and destroying. Finally, my anger management issues have a safe outlet. The bat is a beautiful piece of wood although for reasons unknown to me, the bat came with ugly strapping tape on the wood. Maybe that's a game thing, but I didn't care for it. I had to pick it off and polish the adhesive off it, but now it's a thing of beauty. Smooth and dangerous, just like me."
3,Does the job - no swivel,"It's a fairly comfortable seat, but I was expecting it to swivel. I'm not a drummer so I'm not sure exactly what to expect. I can sit on it for an hour and not be uncomfortable."
4,Cannon drum throne,"When i first received it and locked it to my hight and liking, I noticed it rocked back and forth..I checked the small washer and noticed it was bent to fit the bar and very thin..I replaced it with a thicker washer from the harware store..about 10 cents and the problem was fixed. this throne is well worth the money for a practice seat, however i would not recommended it for 3 hr. gigs, no back rest. great starter seat for beginner and good practice throne for home for the money!"
3,Didn't meet expectations,"It's okay. Not that comfortable, and not that sturdy. For the price, you get what you pay for. I'm still using it, and will continue to use it. But as others have said, you get what you pay for..."
3,Decent but small,"This drum throne is adequate for my needs but seems to be built for a child. Perhaps I missed something in the description, but it is not very robust and is rather low."
2,Not for comfort,"I wasn't to impressed with this drum seat. First off it's hard to adjust because you have to pull out a peg and parts fall off, ect.. Not to mention this throne was not made for comfort at all. I guess if you're looking for a cheap seat like I was then this is it."
5,Finally one of the best TV shows ever on DVD,I have waited years for these DVD's to appear on the market.One of the best TV shows ever. Buy this and you will never regret it!! But do not forget to get the other 4 seasons for the TV-experience that will last you a lifetime.Do not wait ... order this :)
3,"great discs, Way too expensive","This is a great set but it is way too expensive. Around $80 is just too much. Most (not all) tv series are around $50 per season. There isn't anything wrong with the dvd but the price means all but the most diehard fans will be willing to buy it. The makers have been quite dissappointed with sales and last i heard were very unsure if they would release the rest of the seasons.I think were this priced more reasonable they would have more sales. But at nearly $80 dollars and roughly 8 seasons. (sorry i dont' remember the exact number) that is a lot of money. This is a cult series from a cable channel. It had a wide following but it wasn't Seinfeld in its popularity or the number of households it reached, therefore the potential dvd market is a bit smaller. Maybe that's why the price is high but i think it deters people. My friend was extremely excited to buy it until the price hit him square in the mouth. The problem isn't the product its just overpriced."
5,Incredible,"La Femme Nikita was one of the best TV shows of the last decade, a few notable others being Babylon 5 and Twin Peaks. Several other good TV series that had potential got canned early on, like Firefly and VR-5 (the latter being a bit corny trying to masquerade sci-fi as reality). LFN is truly one of the best.Watch LFN as an allegory of the corporate world, as a warning about the future of intelligence agencies and the cold war/hawk ideology, as a defense of the concept of destiny/duty, or as an exploration of social relationships, love, and hate. It doesn't matter. LFN is exquisite in every respect."
5,"PLEASE, RELEASE ALL FIVE SEASONS!","I'm with credit card in stand-by waiting for season 2,3,4,5....Wonderful TV serie and wonderful DVD."
1,Horrible,"It is hard to imagine that this show could be any worse. I purchased season one based on all the good reviews posted here. Those people owe me $20. The concept for the show is the only good thing about it. The acting is terrible. I believe the sets are supposed to look futuristic, but they actually look silly. The director loves to use a great deal of close-up shots that really show the actors' lack of emotional range. The songs and musical score actually detract from the scenes rather than compliment them. The plots are fairly linear and when there are twists, they are so riduculous that it is comical. I purchased this set to watch at work when I'm bored. It's not even good enough for that.If you have never seen this show, Do not waste your money!"
1,Ack! One Star Is One Too Many!,"I cannot believe that something this BAD was created by some of the big names behind 24! The plot lines were full of holes. The acting.....well, I kept expecting to see some, but did not (except for Cassar's episodes, which were somewhat less offensive than the rest). The writing was juvenile, at best. The costumes were.....well.....atrocious. Who dressed these people?I made it through two disks of the first season, and elected to abandon this series.Upon further reflection, I'm downgrading this review to ONE STAR. Relative to other series on DVD, it is Just That Bad. The first few episodes, the lead ""actress"" couldn't even speak with a consistent accent, for crying out loud. The ""plots"" were contrived, amateurish gruel. Old Dr. Who episodes were written better, and they were written for CHILDREN.~so~Don't blame ME if you buy this and wretch with disgust after three episodes. I tried to warn....."
2,I forgot how bad either season one was or this show was.,I used to be a fan of this show. But something happened and I couldnt make the reconnection. Maybe I was just really attracted to chicks with guns?
5,One of the best series to ever grace television!!!,"First, let me say there are not enough stars to rate this show. It was amazing and kept you tuned in each and every week, waiting on the edge of your seat. I have been a HUGE fan of this show ever since it came out on USA Network (9pm on Sundays.....never missed an episode!) You will not be disappointed in buying this DVD set. I re-watch mine often. The story lines a great, the actors and actresses are amazing (I especially like it for Roy Dupuis...he is very very sexy), and this is one of the few DVD sets out there where you will want to buy all of the seasons."
4,very nice...,"This axe has great balance.. the handle has a nice feel, shape, and angle.. the edge will need some work a little off center and could be sharper but with a little TLC its a geat hatchet"
5,Keeping up with the Swedes,"I own and use the axe/hatchet along with the longer 26"" model 45a. Fit and finish was what I expect from Estwing. Being in the construction trades I have swung there hammers for many years. I was somewhat disappointed with the edge, very dull and uneven. I used dry stones, wet stones and a leather strop to get them where I thought they should be, and I am now pleased with there performance. I am not in the timber business, but do practice bushcraft and find these tool true anchors for the work and tasks i do. I am very proud that these are American made, To the fine folks at Estwing.. well done."
4,lightweight,"This is about what I expected, but wish the axe-head were heftier. Its disapointingly thin. And who ever sharpened it at the factory, must have been drunk."
4,Interesting . . . . . .,"If everybody thinks Dick Clark started ""American Bandstand,"" you're wrong. This book tells about ""Bandstand"" before Dick Clark became the host. It goes into great detail about the years between 1952 and 1956.However, the book was slightly disappointing. I bought it in hopes the author would talk a little more about the kids who used to dance on the show (since learning my favorite disc jockey danced on the show in 1953), and it didn't. Can't win 'em all, right? Also there were many spelling and punctuation errors as well. But those can be easilly overlooked. All in all, this was a good book."
1,Not Hardware Raid,"A client asked me to install this card in a linux server for him. I built the array and linux still sees both drives. To use this with linux, you are required to build the system and install RAID software, which performs horribly. This product is very disappointing."
1,Does not work with Quicktime 7+,"I stopped using this card within 1 week after installation. It does not work with Quicktime v7+. Whenever you try to read a quicktime file for the drives attached to this adapter, it will simply crash your array. Contacted support, and they said they know about this problem and that I should see with Apple or use Quicktime 6 instead.I ended up buying the Promise Fasttrak TX2300 which worked flawlessly and even came with the WebManager plus it supports SATA300."
5,Another Must Read,"If you like Kundera, have a fondness for Nietzsche, enjoyed the Bill Murray movie ""Groundhog's Day,"" or sit there mulling over the towering pronouncement from Rilke's ""Archaic Torso of Apollo,"" : 'You must change your life!' then this is the book for you. Even if none of the above apply to you, just take a chance on this slim novel. While I wouldn't recommend the entire mystical theosophist movement that propelled Ouspensky, this work will never quite leave you -- my criterion for a work of great art."
1,Dumb and Dumber,"This story is the dumbest story I've ever read. Who of us would not love to meet a magician that can take us back in time and make us retain all our old memories so that we don't repeat the same mistakes again? This character on the other hand is a retard with a capital R a RETARD. While reading the book one can't help but to want to tell this character you're so STUPID! Over and over again. The title of this book should have been Dumb and Dumber. For those that think this is a great novel, I have only one question for you, what kind of crap have you been reading during your lives?"
5,Artist Blacksmith,"Excellent book, the best blacksmith book I have found. Covers everything for the beginner. Very clear explanations and excellent pictures and photos. If I had the choice to buy just one book I would recommend this book. I am going to buy this authors other books and DVDs."
1,Poor quality -- not living up to the Sony brand,"I purchased this unit at the end of May 2008. My previous DVD player was a cheap Coby, which lasted about 2 years. I decided to pay extra for a name brand, hoping to have many years of trouble-free use. However, 3 months later, the player is no longer working. When I put a DVD in it, it spins and grinds for a few minutes then give up. I tried to contact Sony for warranty service, but I was told that they only cover labor for 3 months and parts for a year. Since I am just outside the 3-month window, I will have to pay $40 plus shipping to have it repaired. I am very disappointed at the quality of this product as well as the warranty term. Sony used to be a great brand, but I am afraid all the outsourcing(and possibly the price pressure of the competition) has forced them to cut corners in design and manufacturing."
3,Disposable DVD player,This DVD player works great while it is working. The price is a good indication of it's true quality.Mine failed after exactly one year and three days.Treat this one as disposable.
1,Stay away from it,"Plugged in fine. That's about it. It played one dvd, and from then on, would not play anymore. I put brand new dvds into it, that worked fine on my other dvd player, but it would keep saying LOADING LOADING LOADING...."
3,More of the same,We purchased 2 of these units. The first was dead out of the box. The second worked perfectly - even my mother-in-law was able to use it without a problem. This seems to match the other reviews that I read.
3,"It works easy to operate,but when the price is under 50 bucks,what can you expect","In todays age,what more can you get dor this price,it plays discs very well,gives you a range of different tones,sound,very easy to forward past coming attractions!"
3,3.5 Rating- Interesting fusion,"This has Jan Hammer using his usual mid seventies analog keyboards, which he uses to great effect on some of these tracks. The music is in the style of jazz (be bop, etc.) but with a dose of early fusion (Miles, Weather Report, etc.). This 'fusion' ensemble really has it's own sound as it is very jazz rooted. Great incendiary grooves & top quality soloing with lots of well placed perc and drums courtesy of Arnold. Great stuff."
3,Silver Blaze,"Despite Moriarty taking one of his long drops at the end of the Arthur Wontner's second film as the great consulting detective, The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, by the time he made his reappearance two films later in Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles, Scotland Yard seem to have forgotten he ever existed, let alone perished. Still, at least the film makes up or it by giving him a nice lair, a disused tube station with a nice art deco desk and a handy lift shaft for unwelcome visitors. Of the Wontner Holmes films, this is the highest regarded, and while it's not as strong as The Sign of Four, it's a good yarn. The moral of the tale: never eat curry a few days before a big race. Sadly the public domain DVD takes a bit of effort: although decent prints do exist in the UK TV, every expense has been spared for this DVD release, so don't be surprised if you have to rewind to catch the odd line of dialogue thanks to a noisy soundtrack."
3,"1 star for quality, 5 stars as entertainment! Average = 3",These hilarious home movies are worth watching if you want a good laugh!
4,A great behind the scenes telling of the lunar module,"A fabulous book telling the story of the design of the lunar module that carried men to the moon. A good human story presenting insight into the engineers personalities and how they delt with the tremendous responsibility that was placed upon them.Look for the ""Towing fee"" presented to North Americian Avaition (the builders of the command module) during the Apollo 13 problem."
2,Cell Phone,"I purchased the cell phone for the primary purpose of using the recording feature to share ""Grandma's Voice"". The quality is unbelievably poor. The cell phone does what it is advertised to do, but the voice quality is almost unusable. There is a lot of background tone that almost drowns out the voice. We ended up just tapping a rhythm on the phone so the baby can at least listen to a drum sound! I would NOT purchase the phone again. The keys are ok. No problems with them but they're not spectacular."
1,It's hard to choose words for how bad this sucked.,"The performances were poorly filmed, antique German studio moments from when it sure looked like Cooper was still drinking; at one point during 'I'm Eighteen' he could barely keep his eyes open and it was either a '72 or '73 performance. The ""pop up trivia"" is pretty much what's on the back of the case plus a few easy factoids. Totally disappointing, unlike his half of the Gruesome Twosome tour when I saw him in Billings, MT last month. Rob Zombie was substandard as a singer, had put together a digital backdrop that had me worried about epileptics in the crowd, and only sang half his own lyrics, while Alice blasted out onstage for 'School's Out' and made driving home the next day (five hours with a BLIZZARD in the rearview mirror) totally worth it."
2,Not Good.....,"Some of the poems in this book are okay,Yet the majority of themare badly written and sometimes make no sense at all.I thoughtsince I'm a teen who likes writing poetry.That I would like this book yet I was disappionted."
2,"Poorly made, overpriced","This is not well made. The collars don't spin smoothly onto the bars - they are too big, so they shake back and forth. Once they are tightened onto the weights, they are stable, but it is metal on metal (only two rubber washers included). There is a bad smell coming from the rubber also. I really don't think these are worth the money. For about $15 more you can get a set of what will probably be similar bars, but with #30 of weights. Skip these, buy something cheaper or get more for your money in a kit."
2,Cheap construction,"The handles are made of hard plastic and hurt the hands when using heavier weights. Also, the chrome splinters off of the collars, which wouldn't bother me much except the splinters get stuck in my hand.That being said, they can take alot of weight (I've used them with 70lbs without issue) and don't misthread easily."
3,BOLAN AND THE KGB,"This is another book having Mack do battle against the Russian KGB. The Russians are trying to force us away from using nuclear energy for power and back to relying on oil, oil which they control, for their profit.The usual back and forth undercover missions with Mack and Hal are evident, with 2 Mossad agents sub rosa working along side. There are kidnappings, murder, explosions, and the normal Big Guy payback from Bolan.Back in the 1980s when this book was written nuclear energy was more to the forefront due to our own 3-Mile Island episode and the accidental nuclear meltdown in Russia, with the ever present term ""China Syndrome"", eventually yielding a Hollywood movie of that title of its own.Today's readers may have some problem relating to this book 20+ years down the pike, but it is a book we Mack Bolan readers will read and enjoy. While there are many better books in the Bolan saga, this one is a read that will entertain for a few evenings. Live Large.Semper Fi."
3,It aint all that,"""Get a Grip"" is (in terms of Aerosmith albums)fairly average. It contains a few great songs - 'Eat the Rich', 'Shutup & Dance' but the majority aren't nearly as good. Still worth the money though."
2,Not worth the money,"Difficult to use, not reliable, must be inserted exactly half way between top and bottom....just really not worth the hassle."
3,good.,Found the book pretty basic and kinda boring for my skill level. The patterns are nice for a person who might be starting out and needs inspiration or a guild to fallow. As a bead worker I think its for the beginner or someone interested in reproducing patterns.
2,"Charger needs an ""overcharge"" warning!","I bought this unit for my father, who has the associated 12V batteries and handtools that require them. He lost the original charger and found like others that now only the 18V charger is manufactured and available in retail stores.This charger worked well for him the first time he charged batteries, but the second time he left the batteries plugged in too long and the charger blew. This is a very poor design and there should be a warning regarding this on the charger. I am buying him a third charger and he will now set a timer to remind him to unplug the batteries after the set charge time. The fact that overcharging blows the charger is absurd, but he doesn't want to toss his handtools so we're stuck buying another charger!"
2,Ryobi,"After purchasing the battery charger I find out the batteries (2) are bad, 12 Volt, can not find any in Home Depot or any place else. I have to trash a good drill and dust buster because of it. That is the last time I ever BUY another Ryobi product again.Don Hojnacki"
1,Not worth it,"This charger worked for one charge only. That was it. I sent it back and got my refund from Amazon, but this thing is not really worth the headache."
2,failed after one use,This was the third one that I have purchased thay failed after one charge by the time I wanted to use the second charge it failed. I should have purchased a new product from Black-Decker in the first place.
1,it fails to charge !!!!,"Better just to buy .... other brand name, Ryobi stop supporting this 12 volt line."
1,Cheap (quality) charger,"Yeah, the charger is cheaply made.The power cord is flimsy and mine quit working the first time I left the battery in the charger overnight.I am seeking a better one before I waste more money on another like this again."
4,This one is okay,This is an okay module but any DM running it is going to have to fill in a lot of material. I think the author designed it that way which isn't a bad thing as each campaign will be different.
3,ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS NEEDED,THIS GRILL PAN IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH CERAMIC COOK TOPS. I WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE I ORDERED IT.
2,Rarely Used,"This is one of those All Clad branded products that really is just using the name. It's made in China. There is no real difference between this branded pan and ones made by other companies. Sure it has the All Clad shaped handle, but the quality, heating characteristics, and functionality is not superior to brands such as Kitchen Aid, Calphalon, etc. With this sort of pan or with a stove top griddle I'd just buy the least expensive, semi-known brand and not pay top dollar for the All Clad name."
3,Home sweet home,"Good acoustic & easy listening music (Walden' score was more personal & inspirate for The Stand), perfect for rockinh chair or diner moment ;)"
2,Tuch lamps,"The lamps look good, but the tuch switch does not work very well.The lamps worked out for me only because I didn't need a tuch switch, I used a remote switch to turn on the lamps."
1,Rip-off (literally!),"It's a nice movie, I knew that before buying, having seen it on TV. My rating would be four stars if it were about the movie. The DVD itself, however--that's a different story.I bought it as a gift for a friend last year. Today I got to see the DVD unsealed, and it's not a professionally made DVD. It is not a disc pressed in a factory, it's just a CD-R ripped and burned on a computer! And even that would be tolerable, except that the image quality is really very poor, the worst DVD I've seen by far. It looks every bit like a pirated copy.It's too late now to return the DVD, and, like I said, it was already presented as a gift. Some gift!I see that the movie is now available in a new release, which came out after I bought this one. If you have to have the movie, buy the other one. You might have better luck."
1,"At least it was entertaining. (Seeing a childmolester dance, that is)","There aren't many words in the english vocabulary that can describe Bad Acid Trip. Like the rest of the U.S. of A., I saw these guys on tour with SOAD and Volta, two bands I really love.From what I could tell, B.A.T. is a black metal/punk/special ed./ex-skinhead group. The lead singer danced around while the guitars thrashed incomprehensibly. The bassist seemed pretty talented, though.Anyway, from the performance I saw, I came to this conclusion:If you hate all bands who have ""sold out"" because their fan base is larger than 6 people (including you and the bandmembers), then this band should be right up your noncomformist alley.Otherwise, steer clear of B.A.T. They suck."
5,Must buy!,"Everyone who like to discover new stuff and be surprised must buy this!It's heavy, Fast and weird but it's not normal hardcore or black metal.It's just Bad acid trip and I think everyone who like System of a down should love this!One of my favorite Album"
3,Batwave TV activated Batmobile,"First of all, my parents bought one for my son at the Dollar Store for $12. This is a cool toy, but it won't work with the TV show like it's supposed to. It works with the included DVD, but not the show. I tried to get support from Mattel, but they don't have a clue. They said they will have to call me back. It still does a lot of stuff anyway. I don't know if the TV show has stopped transmitting the ""Veil technology"" signal that makes it work, or what. It was dissapointing, but my son's only 4, so he doesn't understand what it is supposed to do. He loves it anyway."
5,Rose Hill Drive is the Real Deal,I'm just a cracker from Tampa but these guys are the S&%t. They hit hard and play their instruments like classic rock gods. Currently playing festival gigs with the Who in Europe. Look out for them....
4,Great value for the price,"I bought this as a replacement mattress for my futon frame at my parent's house. It serves its purpose well. I just spent a week sleeping on it. It is a bit uncomfortable at first, because it is very firm and I am used to a soft mattress, but I adjusted to it very quickly. It is very comfortable to sit on. I am not sure how long it will hold up, but it feels pretty sturdy. My only complaint after the first week is that the cover is wrinkled and doesn't look very good. Flipping it often would probably help this, but the mattress is very heavy and awkward. A different cover might also help. I didn't buy it for it's looks though, so this is not a major issue for me. Overall, it seems to be a good deal for the price."
1,Terrible purchase,"Terrible purchase,make sure not to order it!Very uncomfortable,and to return the item is very hard,because it is very bulky!"
4,good fullness but heavy,"I am really surprised at the quality of this mattress for the reasonable price. It is thick. It is comfortable to both sit on or sleep on. The only problem I found is that it is a bit heavy when trying to rearrange it on a lounger type of futon. Make sure you get a cover for it, the light color gets dirty fast. If I have to purchase another futon mattress in the future, I would definitely re order this one."
4,Not Bad,We purchased this for the futon in our basement for the teenagers to use when they are hanging out. So far it seems fine. Delivery was quick - 5 days.
2,problem delivering,"I havent even recieved the futon yet and I am frustrated, first I recieved an email asking me for my address, and yet I know it was on my amazon order, then after waiting a bit I emailed and asked whats going on? they replied that they didnt have my phone number again stuff I know i have given amazon. Today they send me an email telling me it will be shipped in another 6 days, that there is no way to expedite this,and that i should have read the fine print how they dont ship out of the factory for three weeks, I want to know who are the folks who wrote their reviews how they got the futon in 4-5 days ? I usualy go by reviews to make a decision, however this time it wasnt helpful at all."
3,eh!,eh! after like 2 months with this mattress it gets flat and u can feel every piece on the futon. i guess people are right what u pay is what you get. should just spend a little bit more on a better mattress and it would probably last longer
2,Yuck,"Wow...I'm really surprised by reading the variation in responses regarding this product. I feel almost like we all got different things. Mine is extraordinarily heavy. It definitely sags and does not sit on the frame properly, I assume due to its weight. Mine also arrived in rolled up in plastic and tied with twine. The plastic was covered in grease, as others have mentioned.I'm disappointed because it is pretty rough, and very difficult to keep repositioning. I never use it. I never go into that room to sit and I just started thinking how annoying that is.This is a bad mattress. I regret buying it. I should have spent more money. I would like to get rid of it. I wonder if anyone would buy it on Craig's list..."
1,Doesn't come as seen on the website,"The deal on this copper clad pot is very good, except I have sent it back twice because it did not come with a lid. That may be the reason it is $60 off. I am sure it is a 5 star quality saucier otherwise."
4,"Good but not great. Good price, though!","This unit wasn't expensive so I gave it a try. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is annoyingly slow to boot up, read a disc, and start playing. The other really annoying ""feature"" is that a gentle push on the tray will NOT close it! Seems like a simple thing I took for granted with my previous players, but now it's kind of annoying on this one. Still worth it for only $50, but I wish they had added this simple feature."
2,Insufficient output options,"I purchased this unit because it was a Sony, and a replacment for an older unit that died.When it arrived it did not have S-video output, or optical audio output for Dolby 5.1.I was able to swap it for another unit in the house but now my big screen equipment does not match, and the RCA unit is not fully controllable by the Sony Remote Commander.No big deal, but it would have been nice to have a description of the output options in the product description.The more expensive models had some ""new"" type of output that my 60' TV does not support."
5,Great for the price!,"A standard DVD player, for a great price. I bought this because my room needed one, and we just wanted something simple, good, and cheap. It plays the dvd's I bought and has good picture quality. Really simple to use, and comes in silver or black."
4,"Paul Marshall, Atlanta, Ga",Sony DVP-NS57P/B Progressive Scan DVD Player BlackThis is a great medium priced DVD. It has all of the options I looked for except the S Video plug-in. Great sound and picture quality.
5,A place in my heart!,For me these G.I. Joe cartoons will always hold a special place in my heart. I can remember as a boy watching these and then playing with my Joe figures in the backyard. These kinds of cartoons are missing from TV today. It is a shame. I spent a lot of my childhood watching this cartoon and the seasons that followed.Pick this up for your little boy... and take some time to watch it for yourself... Even if it is for the 100th time.
5,At last!,They have finally put two the two best G.I. Joe movies ever madeon dvd and as a plus together. I had the VHS versions and theywore out. I'm so excited they decided to release them again.Go Joe!
5,Practical and grounded,"Lynn Andrews writes with compassion and wisdom. The suggested excercises are interesting, too. A highly recommended read for those seeking insights to what brings us alive."
2,Not worth the money,While this dvd does show some uncommon medicine ball exercices. It is NOT worth more then 10 bucks. It is very low budget quality. You can see that it was made with medicore Imac software. It is also dragging. If it had some upbeat music to go along with the mono tone instruction it would be much better. My opinon is for 30 bucks you can get a much better quality fitness dvd.
4,What you expect.,"It assembled easily and is what it is advertised to be, so it is good. I bought this because it was suggested by Amazon with another purchase that I was already committed to. It is what I expected. However, I should not have bought it because I am not using it and don't have really have space for it. Moral: don't give in to those suggested extras unless you really want them. My kids and wife are using this occasionally, so maybe it was not a waste for me."
4,Great product,"Works great, terrific build quality. All my exercise equipment is Apex/Marcy and they are a good brand name. This item shipped faster than typical for Amazon which is a definite plus. Great value!"
2,Too large and poorly constructed,"This piece of equipment took me hours to setup - and I am usually good about setting up such things. Furthermore, the item seems flimsy and poorly constructed. I am afraid the item would not support my weight. If space is a consideration, this is not the item for you. The item is way too large and takes up a lot a space."
3,You get what you pay for,The bench was not easy to put together. All the pieces did not fit. Some screws were too small. They sent me a used set that was scraped up. It serves it's purpose for the amount of money it costs.
4,Replacement Parts?,I think for the price this was a solid home machine. My only issue is it is near impossible to get replacement parts. If anyone can help please do
4,Roman Chair,Good solid value for the money. The chair is suprisingly stable and is a good piece for a home gym. The pading could have been alittle thicker but overall a good value.
2,"poorly designed, not very usable. very well constructed, affordable","I am surprised to see so many people raving about this thing.Sure, it's well constructed, and the price is right. But it's not very usable.The chair/pad doesn't interface well with male anatomy (I am 5' 10"").I don't understand why the foot bar moves up and down-- it would be impossible to use this with the foot bar at any position other than the highest one-- and I wish that it went a little higher.Here is what would be helpful: if you could adjust the distance between the foot bar and the chair/pad, a feature that you will find on 100% of roman chairs at the gym.Maybe I don't understand the range of exercises that can be done with it? It comes with no suggested exercises, and I have never heard of any being done on a roman chair other than back extensions -- so I doubt that is the problem."
5,Grace for All Seasons,"With a literary style and contemplative spirit akin to Wendell Berry, Fr. Schmitmeyer reveals the extraordinary sacredness found in ordinary rural life, or life lived deeply with other human beings and earth's creatures, for that matter. In a high speed, fairly fragmented world where we long for concrete experiences of community, creation, and conversion, Schmitmeyer illustrates these experiences in ways that no mere church walls can hope to contain. Readers will find his writing to be a tonic that can renew the hungry, the thirsty, the homeless--yes, even the most tired and skeptical souls."
3,Nikon SB-800 CheatSheet,"Pros:The cheatsheet has loads of information that you can look up quickly without having to get the manual out. It is also laminated so you don't have to worry about getting it wet.Cons:The print is kind of small so if you are on the verge of needing reading glasses you will need them to read it. Also, the sheet is about 4.5 X 8.75 inches and does not fold. I does fit in your pocket but sticks out and catches on things.Overall it is a pretty good reference tool, but it is also the only one out there right now."
5,Great!,"These head phones work great. These other reviews are complaining about the low power Bluetooth signal. This has nothing to do with Sony, it's your crappy cell phones.These really sound good, in contrast to some other reviewers, i find the bass very good. You also might need to adjust the setting on the music output, i.e. your phones mp3 player to adjust the treble and bass.I really love these bad boys, and they work for over 6 hours before I have to charge them. The trick is finding the hidden on/off button, as they do not turn off by them self.Also, the phone feature works great. All the people I've talked to on the other end say the voice quality is great."
5,KeySafe is tough,This is a MUST for anyone who accidentally leaves home without his/her keys. A locksmith will cost over $100 to come out and open your door.
5,Cradle Of Wonderful Gore!!!!,If you haven't seen the uncut video for From the Cradle to Enslave...... slap yourself. This video could have been pieced together from clippings on the Hammer Horror cutting floor. Mix with a bunch of circus freaks and you have the genius that is the twisted mind of Danni Filth.
5,PRESIDENT BUSH'S FIRST YEAR,"GEORGE W.BUSH :A HEROIC FIRST YEAR IS A MUST FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS TO RELIVE THE HEROIC YEAR OF PRESIDENT BUSH AS 43 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM JANUARY 20,2001-SEPTEMBER 11,2001. GEORGE W.BUSH :A HEROIC FIRST YEAR HAVE COLOR PHOTOS.THIS BOOK IS A TRUE COLLECTORS EDTION."
5,Quincy's Off Tha Hook!,"First let me say that I love everything that Quincy Jones does!And I'd like to be the first person to review this disc.Then I'd like to say there is not a mediocre cut on this disc. Even the one thatyou think are after a second listen you hear the artistry in every artist and the band.Listen to Paul Jackson Jr.play the blues on One Mint Juleps (He's crazy). And Naturally 7's Wall Of Sound is undeniable, Herbie Hancock, Al Jarreau, Patti Austin and Chaka Khan on Miss Celie's Blues is good as it gets.All the artist and band are all pro's that are at the top of their game.Quincy Jone has always been in his prime and he's not letting up and I defy anyone to say otherwise."
4,just as advertised,"We got this griddle because it is one of the few available that will cover two burners of the larger stoves - this griddle seems to be about the largest one on the market. It holds heat well, the surface seems to heat to an even temperature, and the griddle is easy to clean. It's tough to give five stars to something with no moving parts, so four it is."
5,A ONE IN A LIFETIME BOOK!,"I HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK THAT WENT SRTRAIGHT TO ME HHEART AND TOOK A PERMANENT PLACE THERE. I HAVE READ IT FOUR TIMES AND EACH TIME I AM INSPIRED AND TOUCHED BY THE COURAGE OF THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS.. .LIKEWISE I AM PROFOUNDLY TOUCHED BY THE DEPTH OF THEIR LOVE AND THE PUIRTY AND HONESTY THEY MAINTAIN, IN SOITE OF THEIR DESIRES. ..EVERYONE MUST READ THIS BOOK. ..IF YOU DON'T YOU ARE CHEATING YOURSELF OF ONE OF LIFE'S GREATEST GIFTS. . ."
2,Book not worth reading,"This was one of the books that I would never ever read again. I bought it seeing have it 5 stars, but I think it is worth a lot less. The whole style of writing is very bad (especially the doll word annoyed me), not real life at all and the story is very predictable."
2,2 stars for Elizabeth Perkins and Scott Bakula,"I was very disappointed in this film mainly in the ""actor"" who played Tilden. She was a downright raunchy character. No feeling for anyone but herself at all .... even in a traumatic situation.I didn't care about her at all and she ruined the show for me. Are there really people out there as mean as her?Elizabth Perkins was great but the storyline was much too contrived. A constant effort to drum up emotion. Hard to believe these films even get made let alone promoted.The whole inclusion of the boys and ""period"" was so tacked on. Grrrr.And lest anyone think I am heartless I do think it was very sad but that's more because my own sister just died of breast cancer and not due to the lame effort of this movie to manipulate my emotions."
1,BEWARE - NOT AS ADVERTISED,This bar does not have any padding on it what so ever - not as pictured so now I have to have the hassel of returning this bar.
2,Doesn't fit my All-Clad pots!,"I would have been delighted with this double boiler insert (despite the groove noted by previous reviewers) if it had performed as expected. I own three All-Clad LTD pots I should have been able to use it with : 3 quart, 4 quart and 5 quart. The insert doesn't fit the pots precisely or snugly; it slips and tips when set onto the pots. Obviously, this makes it unsafe as well as unusable. Since I agree with some reviewers that the qualty is inferior to All-Clad products produced in the USA, I guess it may be that the items produced in China are not really a good match with the original items produced before recent globalization of the company. Maybe I just got a bad one, but a previous reviewer mentioned the same problem. For an item of that price from a company with the reputation of All-Clad, this is inexcusable."
5,simple yogurt maker,"I bought this several years ago and use it everyday. I take 1/2 cup yogurt, add a small amount of whole or 2% milk and mix this in a cup. I pour this with a funnel into an empty kefir bottle. I add more milk to fill the bottle and slightly shake this. It takes 24 hours to make a thick, creamy yogurt with a slight tang. Add 6 hours more and you get a tangy, very thick yogurt."
4,Love it- But you must get the Dolls too!,"Rating this toy by itself, 3 stars. But with the Dora and Mariana mermaid dolls, my daughter plays for hours, reinacting Dora Saves the Mermaids. The carriage is very cute and plays a cute little song. The sea horse is a cute addition. It's a favorite at our house! (With the dolls too though. By itself, it would be pretty worthless.)"
5,Very nice gift for a wonderful son and daughter-in-law,Purchased as a Christmas gift. I removed the skillet from the box which could be opened with no damage to box and examined product and sorta wished I had one also. Made in USA.
2,"So basic, it hurts. If you want a real thing - look elsewhere!","I am studying singing, and so far I have had quite a success. My mentor is Jamie Vendera, and I study mostly by his books/CDs. However, I also wanted to see what else is out there as far as singing tutorials go. I picked up quite a few different books, CDs, DVDs. Some of them were quite interesting and challenging. However, this set is far from being really useful, in my opinion. It is so basic that it hurts that I paid for it. It is not taught by any professional singers, rather, by kids! And, those kids don't sound that well either (some of them were just okay, some were just so-so). So, if you'd like to get some useful material to study and learn how to sing properly I would suggest to look elsewhere. My personal recommendations: all books by Jamie Vendera, Hard Rock Academy Performance Vocals DVD, Singing for the Stars: A Complete Program for Training Your Voice (Book & 2 CD's) by Seth Riggs."
1,LAME AS HELL!,"I love ghost story, as movies or documentary and so on...because all these hip an all and stars, I go head and got this DVD. Was a cheesy and lame documentary I ever seen about %90 of this documentary was damn talking to each other and show lame places. And their acts & was a lots talking and B.S!! If u really like this kind of documentary, try to check out UNSOLVED MESTRY series: TITLE ""GHOSTS"" & ""UFO'S"".. Is superior to this trash!Skip this lame boring crap!!! Waste the money!"
3,Not very exciting,"This is a documentory style video that has it's ups and downs. Although it has its moments of believability it also has moments of contradiction between the many psycics visiting the areas around england. There is a story about a man who lost his wife that is very heartwaming and enjoyable. An good choice for someone interested in psycics and the scientific side of ghost hunting, but not a good choice if you are just looking for a scare."
4,An amazing portrait of the paranormal.,"We here them, see them, feel them, fear them. But all and all do we really know anything about them? Travel to Europe and challenge your knowledge of these tormented souls doomed to walk the earth in search of fullfillment they missed during life. Meet interesting people both alive and dead, and all in your own home. Step into this amazing journey into the unknown. A frightening yet true experience too good to pass up."
5,An hysterical classic,"Gerard Derpardieu and Pierre Richard are magic together. This film is even funnier than when they teamed up in ""La chevre"". There is a good reason why hollywood tried to remake this very popular film for American audiences. However, the American remake can't hold a candle to this French original.Pierre plays the bumbling unaware despressive to comic perfection while Gerard's tough no nonsense character provides the perfect contrast resulting in a sensational comedy duo. The mismatched characters pair up to try to find a runnaway boy in hopes of finding out which of them is the rightful father. The humour lasts throughout the film and is great for adults and kids alike. This film is a classic and is known by all in France. It is a must see!"
1,JUNK,"I was hoping that the view good reviews would be promising but this thing is CRUD! It doesn't even do whats advertised! Lightening color. I tried many times and enhanced mode, the suposed lighter color is normal! Un enhanced, the supposed normal is dim!"
2,Waste of money.,"Get real. This gadget does not help in the least bit as far as picture clarity. I wasted my money. The people selling it are probably laughing at all us fools who bought this useless device. Again it does not improve anything or change the picture really at all. Again, don't waste your money. Buy a better TV or HDTV if you want any picture improvement."
2,Big Waste!,"First of all how can this be considered an ""enhancer"" when it requires you to use lowly RCA composite cables. Why downgrade from S-video or component connectors? Besides on most modern t.v.'s there are enough video controls to adjust.At the very least (unless you have an older t.v.) you should wait for a model that supports S-video or component."
4,cheap way to improve your current tv,"if you don't have 3 grand to buy a new tv with, then this is a must buy. i figured i didn't need one until i saw what it did for a buddy of mine, who has a 15 year old tv. my tv's only 2 years old but it dosn't have any of the high tech inputs, i noticed the difference as soon as i plugged mine in. if you're gonna spend a couple of hundred for great graphics, you might as well spend 40 bucks too actually been able too see them."
4,Awsome,This vge game enhancer looks very cool and I did not know anything could do something like that!
4,I like this steamer insert!,"I bought this steamer inseart because my other cookware is stainless All-Clad. While I was at the store to purchase this steamer, I was also looking at the 3 qt All-Clad sauce pan to place it on as I considered the All-Clad 4 qt pan I all ready owned unnecesarily tall for the 3/4 to 1 inch of water needed to steam a few vegetables. I happend to look across the isle and saw a Calphalon Triply Stainless Steel 2-1/2-Quart Shallow Sauce with Cover for $39.95. The All-Clad steamer fit the Calphalon pan perfectly. The glass lid that comes with the Calphalon pan fits the All-Clad steamer insert even better than the All-Clad lid and allows me to see into the steamer without lifting the lid. The Calphalon pan, although made in China, seems to be every bit as good a quality as the All-Clad cookware and a better vaule than the $139 I would have had to pay for the All-Clad 3 qt pan. Just a suggestion."
2,steamer made in CHINA NOT USA,Like most of the reviews have stated about this item--it does not fit properly into the 3 quart sauce pan--especially for the stainless steel set. I do think it fits fairly tight into the LTD series because the rim is a little thicker. It is made in China and not the USA and therefore the tolerance is very large. All Clad needs to address this issue immediately if they don't want to loose customers including myself. Another disappointment is that all the lids are made in china as well...So much for a product that I thought was fully made and assembled in the USA.
3,"Eh, it's OK.","I was excited to add this piece to my All-Clad collection, but I'm a little disappointed with it. It doesn't fit my pans very tightly; a good amount of steam escapes from between the insert and the pan, rather than going up into the chamber with the food. It doesn't have the heft of other All-Clad pieces, either. I think that one of those inexpensive, collapsible chrome steamer inserts that fits down inside any pan works just as well. On the up-side, this item cleans up easily, doubles as a fine colander, and is likely to out-last a collapsible chrome steamer. I'd buy it again, but I wouldn't have as high expectations of it."
4,thumbs up,Flowmaster has always been a preferred brand to me personally. the system installed easily. This was not as loud as I had expected. I did notice improved gas mileage. Also a small gain in power. mostly during higher speeds. I ended up taking the tail piece off and putting a turn down piece and it sounds nicer and exhausts safely below the axle.
2,Unimpressed,"On initial purchase of my Emeril skilliet, I was quite pleased with the significant mass of the skillet, its' handsome looks, how evenly it gained temprature, and yes, how well the nonstick surface released. Though the skillet was never touched with a metal implement, never in a dishwasher, always allowed to cool naturally ( meaning not immersed in water right from the stove ), after only 4 months of use is sticks badly! Considering the care it received, I can only assume that this may be the result of abrasions caused by spices or the one i received was a lemon. I am clueless, but know in either case I am unimpressed and the product has miserably failed to meet my expectations for what I expected from this caliber of product. Hence, why I am here today shpping for new skillets. I read many good reviews here, and I wish all the best of luck. Maybe if you don't use them as frequently as I do, you will have years of service. I however, wont purchase another."
1,Where's the music?,"This DVD does not remember Elvis, it remembes trains.For a beginner, this is lousy, because if you are unfamiliar to Elvis, you should start with a little MUSIC (what a consept!), of which this tape lacks completely. This is even worse than the Beatles' Celebration, which is also unofficial and musicless. My point: DON'T waste your money on this ...! Get the new boxed set, or even the Alternate Aloha."
2,I agree this is a boring album for the most part,"I've been listening to RLJ for at least a couple of decades now, and this is a very forgettable effort for the most part. There's just no ""edge"" here at all, but a few of the songs are passable. Overall a disappointment for sure and a regrettable purchase indeed. Reminds me of a forgettable lounge act that everyone talks over, background music for sure."
1,"Fits 8"" Diameter??","I have a Tramontina 3Qt Tri-Ply saucepan which has EXACTLY an 8"" inside diameter (measured it twice for accuracy). This Emerilware Stainless 3-Quart Steamer Insert has about 1/2 inch smaller diameter....So it will only fit a pot or pan with a7 1/2"" inside diameter. The QUALITY of this steamer insert appears to be good though..."
3,Emeril Steamer Insert,"I was very disappointed with this insert. I unfortunately assumed that it would fit the 3quart pans that I had. I discovered after washing it that it did not. I had to buy a 4quart pan ($69.99) to be able to use it. So after $110.00, I can now steam veggies!"
2,Too noisy for my tastes,"Not relaxing enough for ambient, no beats so the noise seems irrelevant. Too noisy for me."
2,Not Watt's Best Spiel,"I figured if you can write a rock opera about a deaf, dumb, and blind kid that sure plays some pinball, you could write a rock opera about anything. But perhaps you shouldn't write one about a bursted perineum, as on its surface it doesn't seem like the most lyrical or poetical subject.Which would be okay if the music and spiel here were top-notch. As a longtime Watt lover, I found this to be a tough slog. I agree with the previous reviewer that his vocal delivery seems a bit pinched and forced. The ever-present organ adds nice flavor but gets a bit grating over the course of the whole album and I happen to miss guitar. How about Nels Cline on a track or two?Moreover, the songs don't stay with you the way some of the tracks from Engine Room do. As a cathartic experience, I'm sure it did something for Watt. As a listening experience, it leaves a bit to be desired."
4,Memoir and recipies here are a natural combination,"This book shows us the heart of Colorado's western slope with perhaps the only topic (food) that could unlock the reserved nature of this region. Bone is a respectful transplant, never assuming membership. She makes an honest effort to discover the ""there-ness"" of the region by using the tools she knows best -- her love of food and her cooking skills. The book is half memoir of the experience of an East Coast girl suddenly spending ALL of her summers out west, and half the recipies that she developed whilst learning how to love the arid land. Turns out the bounty is both for her and the reader. A VERY enjoyable summer read...and the fruit pie crust recipie is a winner. It wanders a bit at the end of the memoir when for just a few pages the topic slips onto 9/11...but ignore that. It's not what's the book's about. Buy this book for the cover (as I did) and you won't be at all disappointed."
2,Bellydance Superstars Vol. 2,"This was not as good as Vol. 1 The songs were too long & while ""authentic"", weren't very danceable. Some of the beats are irritating, and there's hardly any plain acoustic songs. Skip this one and stick to Bellydance Superstars #1, which is far more danceable and not as melancholy as this one."
3,did you hear something?...,"i couldnt believe this movie as it started. it was so bad i couldnt turn it off! i loved it! there was so much tongue in cheek i think you have to be intelligent to get it. (and im not insulting those who didnt like it) it wasnt about having good special effects, good god thats what hollywood is for. anytime now i hear ""did you hear something?"" i crack up. and the first guy to get ""sucked"" was wearing sheep pajamas and boots! come on, a farmer, wearing sheep pj's..... yes, the movie was out there but if you can handle that, watch it."
1,Terrible trash,"Trite pretentious s***, pile of tired cliches. No wonder rottentomatoes gave it 19%. Tilda Swenton is predictably bad, Di Caprio is much worse than usual."
5,Love that Rikki!,This CD is one of her better music. I highly recommend this one to Rikki fans. Lots of interesting songs.
2,not as good as I expected,I thought that this would be a class A type comedy. I felt it was a disappointment on that vain.I enjoy slapstick. There is nothing like good slapstick! This was nothing like good slapstick
4,A Satire You Either Get or Hate,"Too many people have bashed this movie as plotless, juvenile, insulting, and just plain stupid. The genius of this movie is to bring a cross section of America into the public spotlight via one man's innocent adventure across the United States to capture the American Dream (Pamela Anderson) only to discover not only a hostile citizenry and disillusionment with his perceptions of said dream (the dreaded sex tape between Anderson and Lee) and how the system keeps him from it. Too many people have taken this movie way too seriously. This is a comedy, a satire, a farce. It's meant to be over the top in order to make unpalatable topics and make them easier to digest (racism, religion, etc.). Just sit back and laugh."
5,Plus Times Movie Films,"This movie films is best for all times. Strange happenings like pranks on the teevees, and Borat has much misaligned understandings of the world. Not recommended for children under 10 unless they are prostitute then fine."
3,Occasional Chuckle amongst gross political incorrectness,"Sure, this movie was over the top in un-political correctness, and that was how it was supposed to be. It is a fictional movie that made not only the main caracter look ignorant, but the folks around him. This is filmed much like the Jackass films, ambush style greetings, shocking things with no clothing ect... But this has the bashing of cultures tossed in, like the jewish community, and the extreme right christian fundamentals, which is garunteed to push buttons. Overall, just not that great of a movie, great concept though, and if you shut your mind down for a minute and realize how rediculous some of the stuff in the movie is (like the fight between him and his friend, or the talk of his family) you have to chuckle once in a while. If you must see this, just rent it, don't buy it until you know if you like it or not."
4,Dont get your panties in a bunch..,"It seems alot of people on here are crying a river over ""stereotypes and lies"" and how the poor poor people of Kazakhstan feel about this film. Seriously, give me a break here.. This is a *COMEDY* and I'm sure there are morons out there that may take this seriously but like it or hate it people dont really BELIEVE this guy - we all know its not a real documentary.Theres enough info on here and everywhere else, you know what the film is about so I'm not covering that --- My message here is if you have a sense of humor this is a great comedy - if your going to cry about stereotype crap, well it would seem you are the actual ignorant people because you paid to see it when you certainly should have known better from seeing the trailer."
1,Pointless boorishness,This is the most repulsive and embarrassing movie I've seen. Repulsive for its concentration on scatology and the sheer ugliness of some of its scenes; embarrassing for its cynical exploitation of the courtesy and gentility of the people victimized involuntarily by its creators' relentless and aggressive boorishness.I suggest that future films from Mr. Cohen might attempt to embarrass those who deserve it -- perhaps people who make films like this one.
1,So not funny.,"I watched this with a friend of my awhile ago, who typically loves this sort of thing. I am always up for a laugh too, so i sat down to watch this eagerly.Boy did i waste my time.This was not funny in any sense of the word. The toilet humor was gross, the ethnic jokes were stupid, and the naked guy scene was so over the top i couldnt help but roll my eyes.So glad i didn't buy this, and just borrowed it."
3,funny but...,"there were some funny moments in this film, but i failed to see what all they hype was for."
1,How Much for the Blu-Ray edition!,$47.00 for the blu-ray copy of Borat? No movie is worth that much. I guess Bruno Blu-ray will be $57.00
2,don't get it,"Borat is more stupid than funny. The story is misleading in a way it makes other peoples in the world seem stupid, ignorant and barbarant. Although it does make the Americans look quiet stupid as well."
5,Funny and full of insight,I haven't laughed this hard watching a movie in years. Borat is funny but very disarming in pointing out the hypocrisy & silliness of many aspects of American culture. And the ones targeted in the movie truly deserve his unique treatment for the most part.
3,Overated movie,"This movie was extremely over rated. I felt that yes, this movie was funny, but it has gotten way too much hype. Sasha Baren Cohen does a much better job on the Ali G show. This movie was good and is a good movie to rent, not to buy."
1,In very poor taste...,"...and I am not a person who is easily offended and I am not particularly politically correct: I love ""Family Guy,"" ""All in the Family,"" and the ""Simpsons."" But the thing that all of those shows have in common is everyone is fair game and the intention is to ""call out"" the bigots, e.g. any off-color remarks are meant ironically, not cruelly, and whether it was the intention to be cruel or not, ""Borat"" frequently came across as such. A few laughs; some revolting, gratuitous, fat nudity; and just an all around mean film."
1,A Simple Metaphor,"""Borat"" is the hyped up rollercoaster at a theme park. You hear everyone talking about how great it is, your expectations are through the roof. However, when you get to the theme park, your adrenaline is high, and you are slowly let down to see the rollercoaster is closed. You do not get the experience you were hoping for, and walk away empty, saying, ""this is stupid."" Oh, and you also step in a huge piece of gum and say ""Gross"". (If you watch the movie you will definitely, definitely say ""Gross"")."
1,Terrible waste of time,"I almost walked out of this movie. No, I'm not prudish, nor P-C. It's just cheap shots, cheap humor, and a cheap movie. The movie is just plain filth, and you'll want to take a shower after viewing it. Save your money and don't believe the hype."
1,Borat,"Borat was the most disgusting, unfunny movies I have ever seen. My wife and I with friends watched it, we all agreed to turn off the movie about half into the movie, I immediately remove the DVD from the player and through the movie in the trash. This movie should not have been produced or sold."
1,J. Wilson,"It is very rare that I will destroy a movie that I just purchased, but hearing the 'snap' sound of this un-funny, offensive, and completely tasteless Hollywood flatulence gave me some degree of satisfaction. Awarding one star is far more generous than deserved. Don't waste your money or time on this unless you are an adult with the intellect of an 8-year-old. This is moviemaking at its worst."
1,Controversial???,Potty humor. If you're 13 and you need a reminder of what anti-semitism is then go rent it... otherwise don't even bother. This movie was a complete waste of my time. I give it one star because I couldn't give it anything lower.
1,a GREAT downer!!,"I wont even waste too much time reviewing it. I loved this film from the trailers....(even to the the level of overlooking its extremely insulting attitude to the country is meant to mock). ""Borat"" might be a good comediant (which is questionable...), but he is INDEED, NOT a good actor.... or said in the Borat way: He is a good actor (pause...) NOOOOOT!!!. I really think that one of the things which really ""F""worded the film was the STUPID chasing of ""pamela"", which diverted a huge amout of attention from the main goal of the film. just rent this crap (worth it for a few scenes alone), for it is, indeed, woth to buy......(pause....) NOOOOT!!!!!!"
1,fast paced comedy that will make you laugh the entire time,"I saw this movie in a sneak preview. The movie is a fast paced comedy that will make you laugh the entire time. I will not spoil it for anyone. Borat is a real comedy made on a really low budget. Sacha Baron Cohen is the brains and body behind borat. There are many times in the movie, when he does what he does, where i thought, ""How can he keep a straight face?"" You will laugh within the first 60 seconds of the movie, how many movies can do that, i would say none, short of spaceballs or 40-year old virgin. Borat has many marks at anti-semitism, Sacha in fact is jewish and pokes fun at jews, and everyone else as well. For example, you find how some people in the southern United States, aren't the brightest in the country. Have fun with this movie and enjoy, I and the entire theatre full of people who saw it with me, will back me up when im saying, you will love this movie, if you don't, check your pulse, cause you must be dead."
5,Borat is a smart film even though there are poop jokes and a fat nude man.,"Hilarious film that works on many levels. No one should be offened by this film because everything Borat says is just to get the people's reactions on camera. Get their goats. If you are wanting to watch one of the funniest films in years, see Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan."
2,A little bit goes a long way,"Overall, I'd give this 2.5 stars but half-star ratings are not allowed. I had high hopes for ""Borat,"" based on numerous reviews and comments, but I was disappointed. I expected rude, crude humor, so that aspect did not bother me -- but this is basically a one-joke movie, the joke being that Borat says stupid and outrageous things to provoke stupid and outrageous responses. Which he does. Again and again. Unfortunately, after a while this wears a bit thin, and I found myself glancing repeatedly at the time display on my DVD player.Quite often my reaction was ""Oh, c'mon, this HAS to be a setup, with the interviewees being in on the gag from the start."" Surely, people would see through Borat fairly quickly. How many people hitch-hike with a film crew, after all? So, overall, I'd give this a paper-thin, very marginal thumbs up, but no more. Proceed at your own risk."
4,Great movie,great film tho not sure how much of it is real and how much is staged..takes the piss out of americans which is always funny and theres alot of genuinly LOL moments.
4,Tasteless but very funny,"I have to admit that I had a good time watching this movie, I was laughing hard. However, some of the jokes and some of the scenes (like naked male wrestling) were tasteless. I admit I have mixed feelings about the movie. It seems younger people usually love the movie, but my generation often had reservations.However, I would like to point out to the people who hated this movie:(1) The anti-Semitic, sexist, racist, misogynist, etc. jokes were obvious satire.(2) The movie does not defame Kazakhstan. Borat and the depiction of Kazakhstan is obviously fictional.(3) The movie does not defame the U.S. However, some bigots in the movie succeeded in defaming themselves. Bigots we have all over the world not only in the U.S. (I grew up outside of the U.S./Sweden). Hopefully everone understands that. Also some people came out quite sympathetic.Overall, if you can take a few tasteless jokes then the movie is a big hit."
1,disgusting,"Absolutely the worst ""comedy"" movie we have ever seen. I had seen a few of Borat's shows in Holland (my native country) and they were funny, nothing like the vulgarity of this ""comedy"". We turned it off after 15 minutes, just could not stomach the stupidity and insult towards any kind of culture."
2,Borat's snoozefest reveals America's hunger for humor,"How I wished Bort's Cultural Learnings would have been funny. I thought the premise was goofy -- this sort of ethnic humor wasn't too funny back in the days of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez or Yacob Smirnoff or whatever their names. Nonetheless, I gave it an honest effort, even sitting through the whole thing. While the theater had a lot of people, it struck me that the laughs, and there were some, to be sure, just didn't come often enough for people to feel like they were truly having a good time. I know that at a certain point I waited for it to be over. When it ended I felt like my friends felt the same. The humor is not really offensive; it's just that the film alternates between smugness and overkill. I recommend that you wait to see this when it comes to a discount theater. Watching it made me wonder what a really funny film could accomplish if this movie is ""popular."""
3,I was looking forward to this so much!,"Unfortunately I think it failed to deliver. There are some good parts in it, but I think it goes to far. For one thing, the scene where he is struggling with his friend, was kind of a too much information situation. I also was uncomfortable with him trying to provoke people by pretending to be an innocent guy from some other country. I have a fairly wide ranging sense of humour, and even like Jackass, but this movie just left me feeling uncomfortable. Though as I say, there were some good parts. I love how he talks about his neighbor, and the rivalry between them. Maybe it will grow on me..."
1,"Poor taste, no depth, empty humor","This movie has no depth. The 'humor' is about stupid, twisted sex related topics. The concept had so much potential but failed to deliver real meaning. Watching this movie was like listening to someone say the F-word non stop. The film belongs in the trash can."
2,Overhyped and stupid,"I got all ""Borat""'s angles: making fun of racists, misogynist frat-boys, the religious, and what not. It was just such a let down from all the hype. Really a dull and stupid movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Should Have Watched It First,"It rather makes my skin crawl. I sold this one to the video store. I mean, there were funny parts and it was an interesting social commentary, but the huzz factor outweighed the rest for me at least."
5,Great movie,"If you don't know already, this is a great movie. I would recommend renting it if you haven't seen it already."
1,GROSS--LESS THAN 1 STAR!!!,THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY! IT WAS JUST TOO GROSS! DON'T BUY--WASTE OF MONEY! IF YOU HAVE A QUEASY STOMACH--DON'T WATCH!! IT COULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY WITH BETTER WRITING. INSTEAD SHOCK GROSSNESS WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR WRITING!!!
1,Tasteless low-brow humor,If you have more than a grade school education you will have a hard time sitting through this one.
1,A rip off?,"I have been to about 50 countries, and lived overseas for over 10 years, and could find nothing funny about this movie. And the funny thing about that is, no one who knows me would ever call me PC or culturally sensitive. If Cohen was trying to combat anti-semitism, all he did was shoot himself in the foot and set the movement back about 60 years.In addition, I was disturbed to find that Cohen's caricature of Borat is no doubt a ripoff of comedian Mahir Cagri. (look him up in Wikipedia). Cagri should sue."
1,TRULY CURSED,"THE WITCH'S CURSE is one of the worst sword and sandal epics to grace our screens. The DVD transfer is horrible; the colors are washed out and the sound atrocious. But even if it had the crystal clarity of a better transfer, the material is so bad, it wouldnt help. Kirk Morris, one of those hunky 60s bodybuilders, plays Maciste, a muscleman who appears out of nowhere and goes to hell literally to put and end to a witch's curse. The movie takes place in 16th century Scotland, so what is this Roman gladiator even doing there? Morris has little dialogue, and he spends most of his time showing off his muscles by lifting trees, moving rocks and ditto ditto. It isn't even campy enough to be funny. What a waste of time and effort."
4,Why don't kids learn about this in school?,"Milt Thompson isn't a writer. He's a pilot and, for all practical purposes, an astronaut. This book reads like a chat with a pilot who has been there and done that. Although the prose is a bit lacking, the honesty and quailty of the stories more than compensate for the rather dry and unprofessional style. The rough feel may even inprove the overall effect; reading this book is like sitting in an adjacent booth at Denny's and listening to an old pilot tell stories. He assumes you are an acronym expert so don't expect a lot of explantions of the terms he uses every day. I learned just the right amount about the people, the machines, and the program. No fluff here. Just the facts, with the occasional bit of humor. This one is a keeper."
4,The Greatest Marathon yet...,"Douglas E. Winter's novel RUN is an exciting tale about violence. There's guns to be delivered and Burdan Lane, known as the ""Good Soldier"" to his employer, is assigned to make sure everything runs very smoothly while the deal takes place. But, the deal turns sour and escalates into an opera of extreme violence as double-cross and revenge become the dominant theme. A great story which makes the latest Hollywood action film look lame, this is something a reader can enjoy and read again. I definitely recommend it."
2,"Understanding, we get it!","This was the main textbook in my Curriculum and Instruction class, and it's okay, but VERY redundant. It says to start your lesson by deciding what you want your students to learn (well, duh!) and then don't let a bunch of nice-to-know-but-not-really-important facts get in the way (I guess that's what comes from the SOLs and stuff). And it hammers home the idea that students can LEARN something without really UNDERSTANDING it, which seems a little obvious to me.All in all it's not a BAD book, but Id recommend something by Robert J. Marzano instead. We also used ""Classroom Instruction that Works"" in our class, and it was much better -- easier to read, not as boring or textbook-y, and more practical application type stuff."
3,Well written...poorly reviewed!,"The script is brilliant, and could stand on it's own, but the final product leaves something to be desired...This movie might have been better with some ""A-List"" casting...kudos to the writer... (who is this guy, ""Zettel"", anyway?)..."
4,Surprisingly Good,"After two episodes the show has proven a lot deeper than I expected. I have no clue if this is going to keep up, but not bad."
4,Should last a lifetime,"Two complaints: a lip for pouring would be nice; and empty it's a little tipsy on my ancient gas stovetop.That said, this is endlessly useful for exactly what the name would imply -- sauces. Throwing together a cream sauce for two? Boiling a little water? Reheating something? Why use a big pot when a little one will do? The small size comes in handy when you have all your burners going and don't want something huge getting in the way. Plus it's cute & shiny.There are usually great deals on these smaller pots. (Check out the regular sauce pan as well as this saucier) All the pros I know swear by all clad -- if these will stand up to years of all day, every day restaurant use, then they should be just fine for a generation or two in my kitchen... I just picked up another one of these as a wedding gift for a chef I know, and I'm tempted to get a second for myself."
5,Great Mailbox!!,This mailbox was just what I was looking for. It's heavyweight and looks great. Plenty of room for magazine deliveries and small boxes. I love the finish on it and I am very happy with my purchase!
4,"Attractive, sturdy mailbox","It took me a long time to pick out a new mailbox as it was replacing one my father had made by hand. We still haven't put it up yet, but I can tell you it is a very nice mailbox. The color is very rich and will go with our new doors and windows. It is very sturdy and well-made. The one my father made me had a red flag on it to alert the mailman there is mail to be picked up and I will miss that most of all. I don't understand why mailboxes that are attached to the house can't have the little red flag on it. That is my only real complaint about this box. Other than that, I'm quite sure this mailbox will last for years to come."
5,Perfect mailbox for our home,"The box is deep and holds letters, magazines and over-sized mail. We love that the mail is protected from rain and moisture. It is a very heavy well made and beautiful item. We like hearing the lid close when the postman inserts the mail. That alerts us that the mailed has been delivered. It was not that easy to install; however, it was worth the effort. We get lots of compliments on the mailbox. I would recommend it to everyone."
2,not good enough,"i should start out by saying that i had to send this unit back because it paused and skipped a lot, like if there were 15 layer transfers per dvd. but i won't deduct too much from that since hopefully it was just a flaw in my unit, and not all of them. i have a 65"" widescreen hd set and am very particular about the picture quality. the problem with a high quality large tv is that it magnefies any dvd player's flaws. i have a toshiba sd3800 that is a few years old and consider the prog scan picture i get from that unit first rate. this player, while the prog scan picture was ok, just didn't hold up to my toshiba. the unit did play all region dvd's fine,but i just can't settle for lower picture quality. so if you're a geek like me, don't buy this unit. if you have a smaller tv, or don't stare at the screen debating picture quality, then this unit might be for you."
4,Great music,David Coverdale has been a brilliant singer since he joined Deep Purple in 1974. David is good looking and has a great masculine voice. Jimmy Page is obviously a sensational guitarist from the greatest band of all-time. I alway's thought it would be cool it those jammed together and I'm happy that they did. They both have alot of respect for eachother and anyone with 2 decent ears realises that Coverdale is clearly a better singer than Robert Plant. Hoe can you not like Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple? This is kinda a combination of the 2 and definently worth buying.
4,"A great collection from his eighties work, missing his early red rocker days, still some good stuff","I have had this sammy collection the longest, and it was good for the time. It does skip his early red rocker days after montrose, but it captures his 80's run just prior to and the solo album during Van Halen. These are my favorite songs of his, so its good for me, but Incomplete for his overall body of work. Now they do have the essential red collection out which get back to his Montrose days to present, but it still feels like it is to short to cover his entire work. I really like Three lock Box, which is not included on that collection. So, this one is cheap now on amazon, pick up the red collection and this, and you have a pretty good sammy collection between the two."
4,It's great but incomplete,"Unboxed is a great compliation of the best of Sammy Hagar's solo stuff from the '80s. Every track here is great, including the two new tracks. Whether it's radio-friendly hard rock (""Baby's On Fire"", ""Two Sides Of Love"", ""I'll Fall In Love Again""), heavier riff-based material (""Heavy Metal"", ""I Don't Need Love"", ""Three Lock Box"") or ballads (""Give To Live"", ""Eagles Fly""), everything here is first rate. ""I Can't Drive 55"" and ""There's Only One Way To Rock"" are fantastic rock anthems, with the latter being one of the best concert opening songs ever. The two new songs ""High Hopes"" and ""Buying My Way Into Heaven"" are also strong with a great in your face production. So why not 5 stars? It's missing his biggest solo hit ""Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy"", which granted is lightweight compared to the songs featured here, but still if included would make this album a near perfect collection of hard rock. Still, if there's one Sammy Hagar album to own, this is it."
4,Great CD!,"It's got all of his greatest hits, with the exception of ""Your Love is Driving Me Crazy"". Other than that, it ROCKS!"
4,a magical potpourri,"Great collection of short readings. Some of the historical and geographical mentions were a bit hard to digest, but it was good to get the background information. Fantastic folklore, information on the moon, crafts. Definitely worth the purchase!Blessed Be!"
2,Fluff,"Llewellyn's 1998 Magickal Almanac is full of fluff, just like all of their books and almanacs. The _only_ useful part of the book is the moon phase calendar (which one can easily get from a more respectable source, such as The Witches' Almanac). Everything else is boring editorials that slander everyone who doesn't follow the ""Rede"" (not in so many words of course). I can understand how it would appeal to White Light-ers and Pink Rainbow Wiccans and other such superficial no-nothings, but I see nothing of any use to the serious magician or witch."
4,Good value for the price,I bought these shoes to replace a pair of Sudini shoes I've had for a number of years. They aren't as high end looking as the Sudini but I can't beat the price. They are comfortable and fit my foot well.
2,one shoe wider than the other,one shoe was wider than the other. The foot I needed to be wider has a bunion so it did not fit. I liked the shoe but would not chance again ordering on line since it has been such a hastle to return
5,Learn to Sew for Beginners...,"JAN. 7, 2012I JUST ORDERED THIS BOOK FOR ELEMENTARY-AGE CHILD. IT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT WHEN I RECEIVE IT THEN I'LL KNOW FOR SURE.I PLAN ON WRITING AN ACTUAL REVIEW OF THIS PRODUCT SOON."
2,basic low to mid end tool kit,"has everything you need for basic repairs. functional but not of the highest quality, reflective of the low price. i keep this kit in my second home in the mountains and it has served it's purpose adequately, although i will not be surprised or disappointed if any of the components of this kit fails in the future."
5,Throw a Kiss Harry,"Wonderful book, sweet and warm. I read these books as a child growing up and remember them now, 25+ years later. I am desperately trying to find Throw a Kiss and take a Nap, harry."
4,Easy installation and operation,"Delivered in a timely manner, installation was straight forward, was able to use some parts from the valve I removed and everything just seem to work, no adjustments were necessary"
1,"CPA,s and Tax Attorneys write the Tax Code",This book's views are nonsensical. Have CPA's rewrite the tax code. As if this group wants simplicity? Flat tax shifts the burden to the middle class. Start the payments at whatever level of income everyone thinks is fair. Right now 50% pay no tax. Is that shared burden? Get the congress out of the favor business in the guise of tax code. Why have deductions for housing? Aren't tax paying renters equal to home buyers? So what if I want 10 children and my neighbor has only one. (By the way I own a home and have three boys.) These are choices that should not be influenced or subsidized by fellow tax payers. Congress won't pass a flat tax because it is a source of too much power for Washington and too much money for CPA's.
3,Not for stainless steel,I read online to buy this to help remove scuffs from stainless steel. It didnt work.. It made everything around it shiny so I guess its good for polishing but wont help with scuffs or scrapes. I then had to polish the entire refrigerator so it matched.. But the fridge is nice and shiny now.. Scuffs and all
5,Great Product,Cleans the haze off of stainless cookware better than any other product we have tried.
1,The album does not rock...total pop garbage,"I have all 3 Pettin albums, this is the worst. It's so bad I wouldn't even call it a Pettin album. Terrible bland pop songs with generic lyrics. It's laughable really. It says here the album's asking price is $85....insane. It may be rare and hard to find, that doesn't make it worth $85. If you pay more than 80 cents you paid too much."
3,Fun video,"It's a pretty good video content-wise, but the production quality is horrible. The historical footage, and even much of the recent footage was mastered at incredibly low resolution. Only the narrator and other indoor shots have full dvd resolution. All the other footage is painful to watch due to the pixellation and lack of detail. Come on, guys..."
5,Flipper,"A delightful movie that I enjoyed watching with a friend. I am looking forward to sharing it with my grandchildren, ages 3 & 6."
4,gift,The DVD arrived in timely and good shape. It is a Christams gift so cannot say more than that at present.
1,Not impressed at all,There are much better books out there which do a much better job of explaining problem solving. My favourite is Polya's Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning I and II.
1,Worthless,"A worthless machine!!!! It is almost impossible to feed any thickness of chicken breast or beef though the mangle. There are no gears, only ""O-rings"", to move the tines. As a result the one roller with the turn handle moves but the second does not or not in coordination with the first roller -- and fragile meats like chicken are torn to shreds and beef is simply ""squeezed"" but not tenderized. I can see this thing ending up in the trash or in a garage sale very soon. Worthless, worthless, worthless!!! It might tenderize a tomato or pasta."
1,This thing apparently sucks,"I have been looking for a meat ""cuber/tenderizer"" for a while now. Some are way too expensive and others like this useless piece of **** ! No, I didn't but one to try it out, the other folks who fell victim to believing the information provided in the description of this item did it for me me (and many others as well I'm sure)! Based on the reviews I wouldn't give this thing a negative five star rating, it's obviously a ""child's toy"" and a bad one at that! If I were ""Amazon"", I'd remove this item as in yesterday! The damn thing is going to hurt your reputation for selling quality products... lose it!!! Mr. Tenderizer... ha, more like Mr. what the hell is this thing!"
1,Useless Device,"This machine is really useless. It is made of plastic. The rollers barely spin, and there is not enough pressure on the meat. I tried to tenderize beef steaks and pork chops. They came out the same as they went in, unchanged. If you want to tenderize your meat properly, spend more money, and get a real cuber."
2,Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet,"The movie was surprisingly poor for a 1965 film. The story line was meandering. The special effects were hokey and Basil Rathbone was on screen about a total of 15 minutes for the entire movie. Overall compared to other SF films of this time period, it sucked. Don't fall for the Amazon.com hype. There are much better films to buy on DVD. This is not one of them."
4,A pleasure for anything in print about Mark Tobey.,"I am a big fan of Mark Tobey (especially). Reading the correspondence lets one ""get in on"" the spirit of two artists at work. I wish the color reproductions were presented throughout the text instead of at the end pages. I don't know whether I would call this book ""great"" for a library, but I am pleased it opens a window on the artists' relationship and personal visions."
4,It was exactly what I ordered.,I was looking for a replacement deadbolt that had broke on my existing lock. It fit perfect and was what I was looking for. Great price for a high end Baldwin lock. It had a slight blemish but was acceptable for what I was looking for. Great product for the price.
1,Terrible Product,"I thought I was upgrading my locks until I found that the product does not come with the correct screws for installing. It's has been a nightmare and it has not ended yet. I called Baldwin and I have to go all the way to Miami (a 20 mile trip which would take up to 45 mins each way) to obtain the proper screws and this was after going to Lowes, HD and a local Ace hardware. Never again."
3,I only like one track,"My most sincere apologies to the people who like the first 18 tracks. I have to say I only like the last track. That is why I recorded the G N' R ""Sympathy for the Devil"" only. I think the last track deserves the three stars."
4,Pretty Good,"I listen to a lot of music. Currently it's the only Lyle Mays (w/out Metheny) that I own. This album has some great moments, but his word with Pat Metheny is alot better. Fictionary is a great song, and Mays' rendition of Falling Grace is spectacular and it is amazing how they keep it together. The three musicians make a great combination, and you will not find this sound elsewhere."
4,Decent Spray Bottle,"It is kind of small and takes a couple pumps to get any spray action initially, but other than that it works well / as expected. Handling comfort is good."
4,Good Spray Control,"There isn't a whole lot to say being that these are cheap and plastic. Believe it or not, I bought three competing manufacturers plastic spray bottles and none adjusted worth a heck. Always big drops coming out even when trying a fine mist. That is bloody irritating. These have functioned well. Now I own four."
2,Cheap and pink,"Very cheap plastic (you can easily push in), which is the last thing I want for the purpose I bought it for (storing vegetable wash). Also, it came in pink, which was a surprise and not what I wanted. Quite small too (holds about a cup?)."
1,Assembled wrong,"This was a sold-by loveotc, fulfilled-by Amazon purchase. The sprayer head was assembled wrong at the factory so that the handle doesn't move at all. The trigger unit was not properly inserted into the sprayer head, so you can't squeeze the trigger. So cheap that it is not quite worth the time to send it back."
2,nice while they last,These things are really easy to shatter---and break. Dropped one and a whole big shard broke completely away. Another cracked and everything leaked out. It's like the Pinto of squirt bottles.
3,Meh.,"You would think it would be simple to find a good squirt bottle. Boys and girls, it is not. The Tolco 8 oz proves it once again. It's not bad, really. The top hasn't disintegrated in my hand like the last squirt bottle I bought. Empty or near empty, it wants to tip over. (Which is not cool at all.) It would be nice to be able to choose which colors you get. I bought three, for separate purposes, and ended up with two pink and one black. I'll use them for now, but I haven't found squirt bottle nirvana. Maybe it doesn't exist. I just think it should."
1,Not worth your time,"It is a shame that a book touting ""writing"" on the web should be so poorly written and lack any real new information. If you know how to perform a search on the internet, you don't need this book."
3,What were you thinking??,"I have never felt the need to submit a review to a CD before, but i feel i have to write this one in the vain hope that Carl himself will read it. His mix for fabric 25 is a very good mix, with good track selection, mixing and album flow. HOWEVER, for some reason Mr Craig thought it would be really cool to add his own vocals over the top of some tracks!!!. Phrases like 'get your lighters in the air'...and 'clap your hands' and far too many 'whoooo's' and 'Ughhhh's' for my liking. At no point did i want to get my lighter out and hold it up, nor do i like hearing what Mr Craig sounds like when having sex. Stick to the producing and DJing, leave the vocals & MCing to the professionals. And stay off the whiskey when in the studio!!!! Poor show."
4,You don't have to be a photographer to appreciate...,"...the life of this woman. In fact, this book isn't so much about photographer or the photographer's life as it is about exploration. Arbus told a teacher that she wanted to capture ""evil,"" while her daughter thinks she meant ""the forbidden."" Hidden within the life is a multitude of meanings about what is evil, what is identity, the fringes of consciousness and society, and how some can incorporate what they encounter into themselves, and some can't."
1,OMG PDF are by far easier and more useful (enough said),"Examples are decent but the one provided by the ORBs in the included CD are helluvalot better. If you are looking for more than a first dive into the topic this is light-years away from any in-depth analysis. Fundamental topics such as the POA are just described in a couple of pages. Furthermore, even for beginners this is not a good book. In fact beginners will find themselves in dire straits in many places where the author introduces new interfaces without not just a definition but not even a one word description."
4,thanks,that's for the book my teacher is now buying it... I bought it for his class cause I wasn't getting biomechanics.
5,Kinesiology,I love the way this book is writen and presented. It makes it easier to learn and understand.
1,"High Priced Collection of Cheap, Boring Films","SORRY, but these are the tired old films you can buy for One dollar each at your discount store! I have not seen this box set production, so I can't comment on how clear these transfers might be, but all the films themselves I have seen on DVD, and you can buy them individually for a buck each if you are desperate to see them. But NONE of these were very good to start with. I LOVE Classic films, but these are the crummy films that you view once and never want to see again. Even though they have big names, these are boring films, these are the dregs that are no longer under copywrite. Dont be fooled by the high price, if you want to see these films they are probably all in a DVD collection that costs about $15 for fifty classic films with so-so transfers because these movies have long been in public domain."
4,Awesome,"This video is great. This tape has some of my favorite Aerosmith video's such as Cryin',Amazin' and Crazy, as well as video's I've never seen such as Livin' on the Edge and Angel. I loved it."
2,Well...................,"I am the eleven year old boy who gave this two stars on the fifth of June. I read a coulple reviews and I found one that I should have added in my review. If you like the old Aerosmith, than this is not a CD for you. If you are a newcomer to Aerosmith, and you buy this CD you might like it, But I bought Toys in the Attic after this CD and there is alot of different stuff and I don't think you can beat Toys In the Attic but, lots of people may oppose that."
4,Another soundtrack of the 80s,"I bought this CD last year and I have listened to it a few times. I have to admit that I have skipped past the songs that I am not familiar with yet, hence the four stars. The songs on here that were released in the 80s are the best ones, thought I like the ones from the ""Get a Grip"" CD. Only for casual fans, like me, who aren't interested in getting every single album they have released. Rabid fans have no use for this because they already have all the songs."
2,I feel this is where I outgrew Aerosmith,"I feel that Aerosmith lost some of it's edge in the 90's. I was not a fan of ""Get A Grip"", and I haven't given a chance for ""Nine Lives"". I hate half the songs on here like ""Crying"", ""Crazy"", ""Blind Man"", ""Janie's Got A Gun"". I feel that this was a flake off to Geffen records as they weren't able to get a lucrative deal out of them. I found the songs from ""Permanent Vacation"" that are represented here are the best songs on the album, and ""Living On The Edge"" is just o.k. Otherwise this is a poor excuse for a greatest hits compilation."
5,The Greatest Collection of Hits,"This was my first Aerosmith CD that I bought. I only bought it for the 2 songs on it that I knew. Now, I know every single song! It's great! I listened to the whole 70-80 minute CD everyday for months. It has Aerosmith's best songs and has the lyrics included, so you can sing along. I would recommend it to anyone, even if you don't know the songs. You know them ALL by heart eventually, I promise!"
4,BIg Ones is a big album,"I enjoyed this CD very much. It's a compilation of their 3 most recent albums. my personal favorites on this album are ""Rag Doll,"" ""Dude (Looks Like A Lady),"" ""Eat the Rich,"" and ""Livin' On the Edge."" The other songs are good too. This is one of my favorite CDs to listen to, so buy it and make it yours!"
3,Go ahead in an information audit start,"Actually I think is a very good place to start if you want to learn what is an information audit. Today is very often to find a lot of papers in information audit, but almost everything are about internal audit or financial audit."
2,Something I had to read,"As far as I'm concerned, this book was not worth the money I paid for it. If I didn't have to have it for class, I would have not read past the 2nd chapter. There are a lot of claims made in the book backed up with qualitative studies and with quantitative studies, but there are some claims that are not backed up at all. I'm chary of books like this. It seemed like this was written from a liberal perspective rather than from a purely objective standpoint. This leads the reader to reconsider the qualitative interpretations of the author.My suggestion, if you must read this for class, double check the references and be careful of using quotes from it."
2,"good live band, not good cd",i saw these guyslive as they opened for homegrown and riddlin kids lastnight.they were a good live band but their cd isnt the greatest. i would suggest seeing them live and not buying this album
5,Great Rock Compilation of Their Glorious Latter Days,"This title is misleading. Because it is like saying the collection from Vital Signs and When Seconds Count as Survivor's Greatest Hits. Maybe Greatest Hits Vol.2 may do them justice.Nevertheless I love this greatest hits. Because I have Whitesnake and Slip of The Tongue where lots of tracks are from. If you like this album maybe you will like the masterpieces I've mentioned.My favorites are Is This Love, Here I Go Again(actually it is a re-make of their 1982 track) and Now You Are Gone. And glad to encounter some of the great tracks I have never heard.If you love David Coverdale, check David Coverdale's recent solo Into The Light which is awesome."
1,Big Hair,"Whitesnake were a great band in their day. However in the mid eighties they became a ""big hair"" band and ponced up Here I Go Again with some nasty keyboards and Poisonesque guitar. In short they made a mess of it. I don't care how good the rest of the album is, that just did it for me. The best Whitesnake albums in my humble little opinion are 'Live In The Heart of the City' and 'Lovehunter', the latter because of Medicine Man which is one of the best songs ever written and is probably still the best song in the world except for other songs that might be better than it."
3,Also known as Horror Hotel,"Not a bad movie and Christopher Lee is good. The music is horrible. It's not a Hammer film, but it does come close."
3,Cheesy but funny,This is a great movie if you want to see the cheesy side of the Salem witch trials....predictible but would be fun to watch with a big grop of people to make fun of it...It's awesome
