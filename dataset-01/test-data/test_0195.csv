5,the mystery is why this book didn't hit big,"This is one of the best novels I've read in a long, long time. It's an unusual hybrid of literary novel/mystery, told with a light, at times even comic, touch. The plot is terrific and the characters entirely winning and refreshing. I hope more readers come to it in paperback -- it would be an excellent book club choice."
2,Okay but...,"I was expecting more from this writer. This book was written for television/movies. The descriptions were inadequate. story disjointed, some characters were left out in the end all together.Very disappointing. The first two chapters need to be merged a bit more. I read past the second chapter only because it was a book club book.I will wait for a ""real"" novel from this author. I know she has got one in her yet to come. Jackson Brodie doesn't do anything for me."
1,don't waste your time on this one,"After reading the reviews on the book cover, I was excited to read this book. I kept waiting for it to be worth my while,and endured to the end--in great disappointment. What a waste of time. I got the feeling the author is a sexually deprived woman who made a goal to make every relationship in the book sexual. It was tacky and uncomfortable. The language was offensive. The story lines were weak. The whole reading experience was a waste of good time I should have spent elsewhere. Don't bother to read this one--there are plenty of better things to do with your time."
4,Case Histories is a grabber,"Case Histories is a page turner that is very well written, has fascinating characters and very droll humor for its subject matter. Excellent mystery!"
5,This is how you exploit a genre!,"Awesome-atious! Fantabulitudinous! Atkinson is way overlooked. This should've made the Booker longlist. Oh, wait. It can't make the Booker longlist, because this book actually induces laughter (the good kind). Ah, too bad. Atkinson could use a bigger profile. Get it. It's in paperback soon. Don't make me come find you..."
4,Complex plots woven together,"Word of warning before starting CASE HISTORIES ... this is not a novel for ""skimmers,"" a category into which I occasionally fall. Read carefully, noticing names and other details, and you'll more fully enjoy how Atkinson develops various threads and then weaves them together so skillfully. The characters are beautifully developed and very compelling. A most worthwhile read!"
5,Hated for the book to end.,"Sometimes, when a book is written with love and care, you enter into deeply felt personal relationships with some of the characters. I felt this way about several of our characters: our hero, Jackson, a man who has been through divorce and death and fears losing the only person he really cares about, his daughter, an obese and wounded father who does lose his beautiful daughter, a pathetic, wounded old maid, and collectively for a family when their youngest, sweetest, cutest, happiest sister daughter suddenly disappears.The book is touching, humorous, sometimes unbelievably sad, and yet there is closure in each case, a reason to go on living in a world that can sometimes be ruthless and cruel.I want to visit my friends soon. I want to see how they're doing."
4,"Don't expect a thriller, but still a good read","First I need to correct the first editorial review that places the story 'just outside London'. The setting is Cambridge, a wonderful city in its own right in England, believe it or not there are more cities than London in the United Kingdom!Having said that, I enjoyed the book especially once I stopped expecting a page turning thriller. At the beginning I reccommend a paper and pen to keep track of who's who in the opening cases. The character's were interesting and the character of Jackson was especially human, a far cry from the usual detective novel.My only criticism was the connections in the story. The links between the characters, slight though they were, I found a little bit overkill. It would have been better to only have Jackson as the link."
2,Tedious and Depressing,"I was given this book from my mother in law. We are both HUGE readers and trade off books to save money. Neither of us is too picky about what we read because we read so much. Well, I never got her perspective on the book before I started it so can't say what she thought passing it off to me. I started it and after a few chapters put it down and didn't pick it up again for about 6 months. Until there was nothing at all left to read in my house and then I started it again.It is so tedious. The characters are ugly, with no discernable redeeming qualities. It actually depressed me to read it, however, I was committed to finishing it. I truly can't say anything good. I can't understand the praise for this book.Oh, and I gave it one star, not sure why two popped up on this review. Oh well."
4,A snap shot in time,"Dublin, Ireland, the great homecoming of the immigrants every Christmas, the growing sense of self-confidence instilled by travelling and realising that the rest of the world's population really aren't that cool after all, coming to terms with having U2 as the soundtrack for our lives, ex-girlfriends, obsessions, Achilles heels and laods more familiar stuff - all explored and dealt with in an engaging style by Robert Cremins. Fair play - this is a great read and highly recommended."
1,Dumb & Dumber That Is Not a Movie,"I must say that I only read to page 60 in this book as I just couldn't see wasting my reading time. I will also say that my age is over 70 and I could not accept nor understand the language, vernacular, premises on which the whole story is based. When I saw that two fine citizens rated this book five-star I thought it was going to be a grand read. Possibly a ""modern"" reader would enjoy this ""modern"" book; I didn't. This is the reason they have chocolate and vanilla ice cream: different strokes for different folks."
3,"Not vintage Bir√®li, but a nice item","Thismusic owes to modern, electric treatments of Django classics, and theinfluence is definitely ""Weather Report"" & JacoPastorious "" . It is not typical of most of the Bireli catalogue, save for 2 ill fated Blue Note recordings, currently unavaliable. Bireli is real big for Jaco, and has previouslyrecorded a lovely version of ""3 Views of A Secret"". Yes, attimes, this cd has a ""pop"" feel, but for Bireli's brilliantsolo on ""Moppin' the Bride"" alone, this warrants the cdspurchase, especially if you play guitar. 5 stars if you are guitarist,1 star if you are a "" Jazz purist"" , and 3 stars ingeneral. The arrangements are a bit slick, but the guitar solos are""out of this world"" !"
4,strings remind me of the black watch,"Ida is uncommonly lovely, very beautiful pop with a hushed sensibility--the strings remind me of my favorite other obscure indie pop band the black watch. Achingly heartfelt--sometimes too much so--songs and campfire production. His Name is Alive guy apparently produces them: that seems fitting. Buy this!"
5,TRESTLE STYLE OFFICE DESK IN BLACK FINISH,This desk is perfect for anyone. I was looking for a sturdy but not heavy desk that I could put in the middle of my office. I've always bought desks that you need to place along the wall but this desk is perfect for any room where you would like a desk in the middle. Also it is perfect for two people to use. The top is spacious and two people can work on projects together at the same time comfortably. The desk is easy to put together!! I would recommend to anyone.
2,Needs to be updated,"Hard to believe this product is still being sold when it's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods. Also the claims of good design I feel are overstated. Finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won't be long until they're shaking, this may influence what music you'll end up playing through the system.All said, though, I'd be happy with it for the price if only they'd update it to fully handle my ipod."
2,Pricey for the performance,"The device has always been mediocre from a sound quality point of view, quite tinny. Making it do simple things has always been a chore. It charged our iPods quite well and played the correct song when the alarm would sound. For that, I awarded two stars. As for the function of displaying the correct time, the iHome tends to struggle with this important feature, consistently slow. As of yesterday, it has completely ""lost track of time"". I hope the other iHome newer products received well needed improvements. Save your money, do not purchase. There are better products."
1,It doesn't work,After a lot of time thinking this thing is great I finally got all my controllers so that we could all play a game and it wouldn't work with more than one controller! We had to buy a new one!
4,Never had an issue..works great as a dechlorinator,"This product always worked as as a dechlorinator. I never had an issue with my tap water once conditioned with this product. I have since switched to the big bottles of Prime though since I saw no value in the ""stress coat"" part of it. I did not see a reduction of ""slime"" or anything like that. Prime is a better value when bought in the bigger bottles."
4,Rocco and His Brothers,"Sweeping melodrama that doesn't let up the sudsy action for a good 3 hours. Delon's role as the ultimate enabler made him a star, but the performance of Salvatori as the enablee is the standout. The ultimate supercreep whose total destruction of prostitute Annie Girardot is still shocking to watch. Visconti's operatic style is reined in a *teeny-tiny* bit here, which prompts some to call this ""realist"". 7/10"
4,Humor and Grooooove,"How could anyone not appreciate an intelligent band with a sense of humor and can be groovin' all at the same time? Admittedly, the most irresistibly likable songs are the first 5, but the entire album/cd provides good music and demonstrates that this is a group of musicians that are capable and innovative. Basehead ladies and gentlemen, Basehead."
1,Gizzard of Oz,Do not waste your money on this tape. The audio music is so loud you can't hear the dialogue. The visual is without imagination. Trying to watch it is highly irritating.
4,Not candy but very good,"It had been a while since I'd had a Clif Bar and I'm quite pleased. They have a bit of a ""I'm eating something that's good for me"" flavor but overall are quite tasty. Best of all they maintain a good consistency regardless of the outside temperature and do not become overly sticky in hot weather nor rock hard in cold weather."
2,"Look ugly, strange texture, no taste","The bars look like mudpies, are very dry, and all three ""flavors"" taste the same, meaning that they don't have much flavor at all. I much prefer certain flavors of Balance bars. The only good thing about these Clif bars is that I don't get hungry for several hours after eating one."
2,too granolaly,"It tastes ok at first, a bit too hard to chew, though, and then it has a strange, over-rich aftertaste. Then it sat in my stomach like a rock. It is filling though."
1,CAN THIS BE LEGITIMATE ?,This post refers to the 15 disc set of The Complete I Dream of Jeannie series being offered for $199.99. This is impossible as Sony never pressed the entire series on just 15 discs. The complete series isn`t due to be released to the public until 11-11-08. Beware of this set being offered by third party seller(s). Wait for the legitimately released set by Sony.
3,Its ok i guess,I purchased these as a lunch replacement. these are easy to move around in my bag but they aren't overly tasty and their texture is unappealing.
5,Delicious and Nutritious,"I'm a big fan of the CLIF Builder's Bars. I'm trying to bulk up, and these help immensely. I eat one about 30 minutes before weight lifting, and they give me a good amount of energy (30g carbohydrate) and muscle building material (20g protein). I don't personally do this, but I think they'd also be great to eat immediately post workout if you're trying to bulk up. The carbs will give you an insulin spike in order to go into an anabolic (building) state, and the protein will provide a good amount of muscle building nutrient.By no means should these be used for people dieting and trying to lose weight (unless you plan on using it as a complete meal replacement). But even then, I feel like you could get 300 calories in a more sustaining manner.Personally, I'm a big fan of the Peanut Butter and teh Mint Chocolate Chip flavors, but the Cookies and Cream isn't bad. Give one a try pre-workout, you will not be disappointed!"
3,lid shattered,"This is great cookware except for the lids, one of mine completely shattered in the dishwasher. At the moment I am cooking a pot roast in the oven at 400 degrees and I am on pins and needles about the lid, this is the first time I have done this, hope this one doesn't break! Otherwise great."
5,Excellent LCD Monitor,"I just bought this monitor on June 18 but not from Amazon though. This monitor is an excellent monitor, I think it's about the same quality as the Dell Ultrasharp 1901FP, if not better. When I first hooked this monitor up, it's a little too bright for me so I have to turn it down a bit and it's a little bit difficult to hook the monitor cable up, but you only need to do it once so that wasn't a problem. And for the price on a 19"" you cannot beat and it's also a excellent monitor. I am a very picky person and this monitor leave me with speechless when I hooked it up. Oh yeah, and no dead pixel for me."
3,Not bad for the price,"Bought this for my 8 year old son. The good thing is the device is a reasonably cheap way to keep him entertained on a long car ride. Also the device is inexpensive, as are the discs.The bad thing is that the PVD format is proprietary, so the discs aren't compatible with anything else. The other bad thing is the power usage is inefficient seeming, batteries wear out quickly.Ok for what it is."
3,"A bit cheesy, but OK","This is merely a videotaped lecture: with PowerPoint slides and Flip-Chart lists. The information is helpful, but can be found elsewhere on the Internet."
3,"Informative, but not user friendly or quick.","I bought two books for my trip to the Smokies. This book and Johnny Molloy's ""Day and Overnight Hikes in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park"" I tried to use both books, but I consistently returned to Molloys. The Albrights book would be all right to use if you wanted to sit down and read it from cover to cover, or at least a section of the park you want to explore. It is nearly impossible to flip through and find any specific trail. Beside this, their tone especially in the introduction put me off from this book. I think its designed to encourage anyone to try hiking, which is good, but for someone that has hiked for years, it treats me, the reader, as a simpleton, who has never stepped off the pavement in my life. This book is useful, but not as useful or concise as Molloy's guidebook."
1,Six days and Seven Nights of Agony,"This movies was bad. Harrison Ford and Anne Heche have no chemistry at all. They might as well have played father and daughter to each other. It basically was pathetic how they got off that island, like those pirates wouldn't have been able to kill those two. I wouldn't see this film if I was forced to."
2,SAD...,"Where are you going, Ford? What is this? A mere vehicle to change pace for a while, trying to be humouristic. But it doesn't work. The proof of this is the ludicrous scene where pirates appears out from the blue..! One good point: Anne HEche is so beautiful as beautiful women are supposed tobe. She's marvellous!"
5,six days seven nights,One of the best movies Harrison has ever made Great movie for a cold winters night in Minnesota takes you to the Islands for warmth & sunshine. Love it
5,"Six Days, Seven Nights","I really loved the movie because how Harrison Ford and Anne Heche played so well together. David Schwimmer was very comical also. It had humor, action and adventure. It would be a very good buy to add to your movie collection."
3,Easy to watch entertainment,"I've seen this movie several times, and still enjoy it. While the dialoge is pretty simple and the plot somewhat predictable, there is enough action to keep the viewer's attention. It also contains some funny lines and situations. Finally, this movie just might make someone ask themself if it really is time to get into a slower-paced lifestyle. Enjoy!"
2,"Symphony, not islandy",All of your reviews I read that lead me to buying this CD indicated this was island music. It is not island music by any means---very symphonic. Good for the right setting but definitely not what I expected.
3,GOOD BUT...,Doesn't live up to potential. I like this movie don't get me wrong but it's too short and the bad situation Ford and Heche get into is resolved too quickly and half-heartedly. The scene in the trailer where Ford hauls a bad guy over a waterfall is not in the film. Maybe this means some action was cut...
4,High five plus one,"This movie is a scream! I laughed so hard during the xanax scene I had to hit pause to dry my eyes, talk about a mental muargarita this video delivers. It's all fun and no downers. Pick this up sometime when you're feeling blue and forget about it!"
4,Early Pee Wee at his best,"This is the show that started it all. A nightclub act produced especially for adults. Twisted humor at it's finest with an outstanding performance by the great Phil Hartman as ""Captain Karl"". You gotta love the old film about manners and hygiene from the 50's. If you miss this one you could be a ""Mr. Bungle"""
5,"Great, Creative, Subversive Comedy","This is an off-the-wall, brilliant comedy piece. I have been a sometimes fan of the Playhouse, and I was surprised at how imaginative and enjoyable the Tim Burton/Paul Rubens movie creation was, but this original HBO special really takes the cake. It's as if you took that internal kid and allowed everything to come out, including the dirty stuff. It's all tongue-firmly-in-cheek, and all the surrounding characters are brilliantly played in addition to Rubens odd PeeWee creation.Anyway, a friend had introduced this to me on VHS. Now that it's on DVD, I plan to purchase it immediately."
3,The Pee-Wee Herman Show-Live at the Roxy Theater,Not everyone enjoys this DVD but it always makes me laugh after a crappy day.
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed with the product, because the gator clamps wil not hold. One clamp on the back will not hold and the adjustment clamps will not engage."
3,"Too Expensive, Short Lived",Only an hour and a half of usage fully charged. You'll need half a dozen of these.
3,Win Some...... Lose Some!,"I bought this cd when it came out in '94 on the basis of the title tune which got a lot of air play in St. Louis. The band is one kickin' organization.......dynamic,.....certainly energetic with mucho talent.At first, I only cared for the title track and ""Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love"", one of the most beautiful compositions I've heard. After playing the disk over the years, I've come to appreciate MOST of the other tracks(I could always give credit to the musicianship). If I live another four lives, ""Don't Be Afraid....etc."" will never be anything but discordant noise! To a lessor extent.....the opening and closing of ""Weird Nightmare "" falls into that category also, the sound allusion to the title notwithstanding.Basically, if you're a Mingus fan.....this is great! If you're not into the more experimental stuff, be a little cautious when considering this one."
3,Disappointing and boring,"I like Bryan Burrough a lot and I love space. But there is really a little too much detail here for non-space buff. The story had ample opportunity to read like a novel. Instead, it often reads like a NASA report."
3,Why was Lucid so successful?,"I enjoyed the book and the insights into the clashing of two cultures. I kept wondering, however, how it was that with all the reported problems, politics, technical glitches, lack of proper training, etc., that Shannon Lucid had such a successful mission. Seems like the author glossed over that to focus on drumming up more of a story than may have really existed. Whatever worked right with Lucid - we need to learn more from that."
5,Love this toy it's great,This toy rocks I got it for christmas it doesn't bounce like the comercials say but it bounces great. I miss it I triped over it and busted the turnbucle. I highly recomend them. If you need to occupy your kids for a while this is the toy. Only one problem .......... you bring a friend to your house to play with it and they wont leave because they love it.
5,Quilt books,this is an excellent quilt book especially if you like more than one type of block in your quilt. It is very interesting and eye catching. We are using the Illinois and Card trick pattern for our raffle quilt for our church. We enjoy looking at the book and have picked out several more patterns. Wonderful quilt book to work with.
5,A Modern Day Classic,This should be on the reading list of every Christian and should be required reading for every Christian Leader. The book reveals the snares of leadership and the way to life through forgiveness and trusting God to see our dreams fullfilled.
5,Great book,"This book is short and sweet. It gets takes you along the story of David in 3 different point of views. Its great becasue after reading it, I can apply it to the struggles to my life and find a better way of handling the situation."
2,KILLED MY WIRELESS,THIS BLUETOOTH WORKS FINE BUT THE RANGE IS NO WHERE AS LONG AS IT STATES AND I COULD NOT USE MY WIRELESS WHILE THE BLUETOOTH SOFTWARE THAT IT CAME WITH WAS INSTALLED
2,Someone was indulgent.,"This book is a rhapsody on the theme of American independence, but isn't up to Tuchman's usual standard or those from whom she borrows. The Revolutionary War has been examined so many times that one expects a revisit to provide new information or insight; this book lacks both. Original materials (see Huddleston) are more entertaining, and textbooks more informative. As it stands, the book is a good introduction to the War of Independence, but superfluous to those familiar with it and useless to the specialist.It could have been a third shorter, if efficiency had prevailed over style. A sentence may run to a hundred words, with appositions inside parenthetical expressions. Was it dictated rather than written? Was the author, consciously or unconsciously, emulating Eighteenth Century prose while describing an Eighteenth Century war? Footnotes aren't indicated, leaving the reader to discover them after finishing the text. Was her editor out to lunch?"
3,Not what I expected,I thought this book would of been a real love story. I was disappointed because it was such a let down. I was hoping that Gabriel and Alex love would be this great story line love instead was fell flat. The part that I hated was when Alex walked out of Gabriel's home because she found out who his fianc√©e was. That did not make any sense to me. And then Gabriel overheard her tell her husband that she still loves him and then walked off. Nothing fell out to me about it's book. I try to like it but I could not. There will be part two which I know I am not interested in.
5,Didn't want it to end,This book took me through so many emotions I didn't think I would survive. I knew I was going to get mad at the end and I still couldn't put it down. I am on puns and needles waiting in part 2 because a love like that should not have to wait a lifetime. Great work.
3,It was okay.,"I enjoyed it, but it read like a generic romance. Her description of Jack Rhys is incredible and the story line is interesting. But it just left me sort of flat. If you like romance with not much else in the plotline - read it, you won't be disappointed."
3,"In the end a good pirate romance, but took a while to warm up to","A fun, fast paced pirate adventure romance story. Some good twists in the end too. It took me nearly half the book to really warm up to these characters, but once I did I found myself really enjoying this book. I had some small issues with our heroine claiming to love her fianc√©, but so quickly forgets about him and finds love with our hero. There is also the unbelievable subplot of decorating her private room with nice linens and furniture, and adorning her with pretty clothes that fit...etc. Even in fantasy fiction, its hard to believe a pirate ship would come stocked with so much non essentials. But if you can overlook such writing ""liberties"" used soley to keep a story cohesive, you may very well enjoy this book."
3,Disappointed,"The hype for this book did not live up to the content. The ""Master"" of Seduction was not even close to being a master and in fact seemed at times fairly naive. Next time I will be more selective in my choice of MacGregor books."
4,A Compelling Narrative with Its Flaws,"Campbell writes compelling narrative with a fascinating array of characters - corrupt dictators, warlords, mercenaries, peacekeepers, child soldiers, missionaries, shady Middle Eastern merchants, diamond buyers, jewelers, diplomats, et al. - weaving in the tragedy that the pursuit of instant riches in the alluvial diamond fields of West Africa has wrought. The result is a modern morality tale about the scarce resources, globalization, and violence.The book, however, is flawed by its author's failure to properly situate his narrative within the historical and political context of subregional conflict involving Liberia and Sierra Leone. The reader would thus do well to supplement this volume with a good political narrative like Pham's LIBERIA: PORTRAIT OF A FAILED STATE (Reed Press) or Ellis's MASK OF ANARCHY (New York University Press) in order to get a complete picture."
3,"Good, But a Little Sparse","This book was not at all what I had expected, in that it features a lot of superfluous personal touch that, in a story that isn't Campbell's, just doesn't belong. I wish that it had contained more statistics and factual research than just tales of his visits to Sierra Leone, with less-than-necessary intervals of fact. However, it was still an interesting read, and I definitely recommend it to someone who's seeking a general outline of the history of blood diamonds."
5,Put Her On Top,"What do I like about Aimee? Her songs are real, unique and authentic. You can see her through the songs and through her voice - direct, clear, honest and punchy - and that brings me real pleasure. Not to mention that Mann has a wonderful feeling for the melodic line and a unique way of writing lyrics. When I listen to her music I see an interesting, independent, sparky, intelligent, irrepressible woman - in other words, attractive and sexy. Perhaps i am getting old."
3,Is this a Girl or Boy Whale?,"My 4 year old daughter noticed something about this book/story that I never did as a child. The story is about a girl whale, but the whale in the picture is definitely a boy-like whale. Later in the story, the whale meets up with a friend that is definitely a girl-like whale, but they never say if it's a girl or boy whale.It's an OK story, but the pictures really don't seem to match up to the story. Leave it to a 4 year old to split hairs. We still like it enough, but it's hard to get through the story without a predictable discussion about the sex of the whale (which really doesn't matter to me, but for some reason matters to my daughter)."
5,The Best of Billy Vaughn & his Orchestra Review,"I'm very happy with this record. I'm a fan of Billy Vaughn, and I love almost all the songs in this record. The recording sound quality is excellent. I recommend this audio CD to those who love pop songs in the fifties and early sixties."
5,The Best of Billy Vaughn & his Orchestra,I almost let this one slip by. Years ago I had a stereo with his record and most of these songs. Hearing it now on CD is fabulous! I'm so happy to have it.
2,Dragon jigsaw puzzle,"The pieces do not interlock well. You cannot pick up and move a block of pieces at one time. The shapes of the pieces are also unoriginal. In the future, the only puzzles I will buy are Springboks."
2,not so great,"I bought this stuff to try to fix some long sratches on my hood. After testing it on a couple scratches, I returned it. The pens let out way too much primer/clearcoat for one scratch, then after all the sanding you have to do to make it smooth, the area around the scratch is very dull. The polishing compund does not work to completely re-shine the area and the final result is not good. Gets rid of the scratch though."
4,Works great for most slicing,"It works good for most vegetables I use. really hard vegetables like sweet potatoes are dangerous to do without a protective glove. I would get it again, but may need to get a potato press for sweet potatoes too."
1,dangerous product,"I was very excited to replace my old $15 mandolin with this product... unfortunately, I am writing this review after a trip to the hospital to stop the bleeding caused by this piece of contraption. The blades are completely dull and the food holder is a joke .. put these two together and you get a very dangerous product. This morning my attempts at shredding a potato ended in my slicing a piece of my thumb off. The dull blade alongside the stupid food holder and the extra unnecessary gap between the platform and the blade means the food gets stuck and my hand ended up going through the blade. If I had a litigious bone in my body I would sue this company for a very defective product.Save your money and your fingertips, avoid this product"
4,Nice product,The product arrived exactly how we expected it. Lots of choices available on the site. We are enjoying all the features.
4,Northern Lights,"I really enjoyed this book! I have spent alot of time in Alaska, and it is the perfect setting. It is a bit unusual, but there isn't just one story being told. The current drama involves Nate Burke, the new chief of police by way of Baltimore, and Meg Galloway, a local pilot. They are oil and water, but of course it is lust at first sight. While we are following the new journey for Meg and Nate, the other story being told from the past at the same time is of Pat Galloway. Meg's father has been missing for 16 years, and we learn what happened to him all those years ago. As both stories collide, the mystery and danger escalate."
2,not up to her usual standards,"I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers. I have read and loved almost all of Nora Roberts works but this one left me cold. Her hero was whinny (sp) her heroine, as someone else stated, was too masculine. I've noticed in the last couple of her books the female lead in the stories were all ready to jump into bed at the drop of a hat and all had done so with many other men in their past. The romance just wasn't there. There didn't seem to be the connection between these two that she had in her other books. I wouldn't recommend buying this book in hardcover...wait for the paperback or borrow it from your local library."
5,Tooooo Loonnggg...but a great read...,"Okay, so some of NR's fans are a little disappointed with her romance scenes. I've been there a time or two myself. But make no mistake, Northern Lights is a great read. I'm a romantic, and I didn't even notice there wasn't a lot of romance and great love scenes until after I'd finished reading this novel. I can honestly say, it was too long, but it held my interest continuously and I enjoyed every minute of this novel. I wanted to give it four stars because it was too long, but how could I when I could barely put it down. I'd recommend this book to all mystery readers, but if you're looking for NR's usual hot sex scenes, then this one isn't going to do it for you."
3,Good,"I would have given this book a higher rating, but the ending seems too forumlaic. It was a hard book to get into at first, but then I really enjoyed it. It kept my attention throughout and made me want to pick it up every day to read more and that is not something that happens to me usually. However, the ending, or the answer to the murder, seemed to be too easy. It made me wonder if the author/publisher decided that the book was already 600+ pages and needed to end and they did so abruptly. Otherwise I recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,"The plot might be good but why tell us all about it on page 248? From there I lost interest in finding out who did it. I already knew. You also have to love 'Cop stories', handosme big man with a sad past looking for love. His girlfriend is not all that charming and I felt that 4-letter words were too many and did not add anything to the story.This is my personal opinion."
1,The Light goes out in Northern Lights,"This is a truly horrible book. If you must read it, borrow it from your library. I wouldn't even buy it as a paperback. I'm very tired of Ms. Roberts' heroines being the brains and her ""heroes"" always needing to be corrected by a ""smart"" woman. None of these characters can be recognized as real people. Her women are becoming angrier and angrier and her men are becoming more and more weak-kneed. While, thankfully, there was nothing supernatural in this book (I very tired of witches and fairies, what's wrong with regular people?), there were no sparks either."
2,Tepid tea served with a soggy scone,"An easy read for those who like their stories premasticated. For those who prefer their stories unchewed, there is always See Night Run. Save your money."
5,What a Girl Wants,"This is a delightful story and the actors are great in their rolls. I think adults and teens will enjoy it. The story moves along well, and does not get boring. There is a lot of humor and a lot of feeling."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible",My wife and I started to watch What a Girl Wants because of Colin Firth who was fine but the movie as a whole was terrible. We struggled through about 30 minutes before switching the channel. Amanda Bynes was extremely irritating as the daughter. This movie is about on a par with the teen shows on the Disney Channel. I am very disappointed because the premise was good but the execution was not.
2,Cliched and silly,"Sometimes I enjoy silly films if they are heartwarming enough, but that wasn't the case with this one. It is packed with cliches, Amanda Bynes is boringly portrayed as this free-spirited American teen with an innocent disregard for English pomposity and the airs and graces of her relatives. After being pestered by the stereotypical, arrogant public-school boy with his condescending attitude to the other 'lower clahss imbuhcile', she falls for the nice boy who's really american at heart, free and classless. When this lad she falls for starts talking about ""I was a part of this system and I just came to realise how shallow it is"" (or whatever) I felt like laughing. There are many more stupid aspects but I can't be bothered mentioning them.I enjoyed watching Amanda Bynes, she's really beautiful with her cute teenage demeanor... otherwise, there is not much worth seeing."
4,A chick Flick,"Watch with your friends, have fun. Don't pay attention to the weak acting, sensless storyline, and predictable plot. ok?"
4,Much more economical that those at the pet store,"I have seen these at dog parks and i love the bags. So I decided to buy a box for useat home. When we go out with the dogs, we tear off a couple and put them in ourpockets. Why didn't I think of this before!"
3,Decent item,"They are conveniently packaged, but somewhat difficult to get open I try to prep some prior to a walk because it really takes a few moments to rub the bag to create some friction and find a separation at the opening. Believe me, I am a thrifty individual, so I am really on the fence about purchasing them again."
5,Scooby Doo Vtech Vflash Smartdisc,"My kids, age 4 and 6, are having tons of fun exploring this game and they've been able to figure it out by themselves so far."
2,not that useful,"The cards is too confusing to use. There are not enough explanations. I was expecting the text to be in the writing used in the Torah,"
2,A Little Disappointed,"In brushing up my OT Hebrew, I purchased this set to review basic vobaulary wordsUnless you are already fluent or enrolled in a high level Hebrew course, they are not hekpful at all,as they do not have the Englisht ranslation on the card!I now have a box that I cannot use!Along wiithout any verse references,I'm a little Disappionted"
5,WOW !!!!!!!! WHAT A GREAT READ!!!,This is a book that you can read over and over again. It made me laugh and cry. Kinley Macgregor is the BEST.
4,refreshing - funny - great heroine,"After reading this book, I was left wondering who was the master of desire. In a twist on the romance novel formula the heroine Emily is chasing after/desiring the hero Draven. It was a refreshing change of pace.Emily is a spunky character that I admired and the humor in this book made it a delightful read."
4,a light and enjoyable read,"This is the first book I have read by Kinley Macgregor and definitely won't be my last. This book has it all... compassionate characters, steamy sex, and an interesting medieval plot that will have you positively giggling throughout. I love a book that can combine these elements with humour. I look forward to reading more from this author."
1,Never Received,"Though seller stated item would arrive by late Feb., it never did arrive. To date (3/9/2009) I have heard nothing from the seller"
4,pretty good,i ordered 3 flicks the same day from three different sources. this one arrived last but to be fair it did arrive earlier than the estimated delivery date.
5,A great film,"This film is simply spectacular, while it's a bit broken down to fit onto film it pretty much sums up the story of the American dream and the powers that want to destroy it. For auto enthusiasts and a general audience this film will show exactly how Corporate America has slowed the advancement of technology ensuring we fall behind while other countries advance. Jeff Bridges' performance is fantastic and his supporting cast is great as well. The elder Bridges does a great job of playing the ""evil"" senator. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in automobiles or just wants to learn a little bit of American history."
5,Preston Tucker -- an innovator ahead of his time,"It's amazing to think that Tucker's car featured so many innovative ideas that are now standard on modern cars -- safety glass, padded dashboard, disk brakes, and fuel injection -- in the late '40's? All this cutting edge technology wrapped in a a stunning body with lightning-quick speeds (for the time).But this really isn't a story about the car. It's about the chances of one man versus an industrial juggernaught. The film seems to imply what many historians seem to believe -- that the Tucker car simply couldn't be allowed to be built, and Detroit's Big Three (and their political connections) would make sure of that.It makes me wonder. Can a person that invents a better mousetrap (or car, or telephone, or computer operating system, etc.) really achieve ""the American Dream""?"
4,Generally good and usually startling opening repertoire book,"To play 1.e4 requires either a lot of knowledge about a lot of different opening systems, or a good, brief set of tools to prepare you to deal with most of the stuff that you may only run across occasionally. Or if you just want to ""startle"" your opponent (Cochrane Gambit, Koltanowski Var. vs. Italian Game), this book should pretty much set you on your way. The quality of some analysis is a little weak, leaving you in a fog after the line's summary, and some opening systems will never be tried by anyone but the brave, but on the whole, it's a good general work."
3,"Stop living in the past, Mary!","In 1992 Mary broke new ground with What's the 411? with hip-hop beats and really good soulful singing. Now it's ten years later and she's still trying to kick that flava. Why? What happened to her adult issues that she shared on albums like My Life or Mary? Yeah, ""Family Affair"" was a smash, but only to the kids who still listen to the radio and watch video channels. Does she not think that people my age who grew up with her buy albums anymore? If so, then she's probably right, because of the proven-formula state that hip hop/r&b is in now. This album is full of songs that probably would have struck a chord with me back in 1992, and it's a hit with anyone under 21 years old, but the rest of us will continue to listen to Ms. Blige with our arms crossed."
1,Give me da drama,"I am a Mary fan, but I was so disappointed at the fact that Mary put this type of garbage out.I listened to the album twice, no lie and I never listened to it again. It is not one song on that album I like, not one.There is no more I can say. Mary needs to try to forget that she put this album out.Later...."
2,Too much drama,"I was very disappointed with this album. Mary's music, until this album, grew up with each release, showing how her voice and her content could mature over time. This album is a throw back. The melodies feel played, the lyrics are unoriginal and you just feel like her heart wasn't into it. The only truly worthwhile songs are the ones already being played on the radio which makes this album a waste of [money]."
5,Oh you didn't know her name was Mary J. ?,"I think it is the best since ""My Life"" My favorite songs are ""2U"" ""Crazy Games"" and ""Dance For Me"" i thought this cd was gonna be wack but i'm glad my friend presured me to get it! ... I thought you said that you love me and then you go and cheat on me with another guy? You said we were coming out of the closet together and tell everyone we are gay and then soon get married. You have banned me from your sites and did me soo wrong but i love you!!!"
5,Mary J B gives No More Drama!!,"I recently saw Mary J. on a talk show and fell inlove with her music. She is a great artist, one of the best if I might add. Each number is powerful and just the right beat. On the album, I believe Track 16, contains a poem written by Mary J. which is totally spectacular and motivating. Buy the album now!!"
2,Average,Mary J.Blige what Happen?after Her First Two Albums it's been downhill since then.yes She has had alot of Drama in Her Life but after awhile it gets Boring&Predictable&this Album is no different.no matter who She is Working with the Formula is intact now.Her Vocals don't Move me much anymore.Music&Lyrics don't really go anywhere.I'd give this Album a 2&half.She has Moments but a whole far from her Best.
3,"NOT HER BEST,BUT COOL","Mary J. Blige is one of the best soul vocalists of a gener-ation as her ""My Life"" and ""Mary"" albums proved.So whereas""Mary"" had quailty production,Blige's latest ""No More Drama""skids.While tracks like ""Family Affair"",""Steal Away"",""Crazy Games"",and the deep ""Where I've Been""(featuring Eve)are tight.""No More Drama"" isn't that devolped.A lot of these songs aretired sounding and unoriginal.But the title track is the album'sand Mary's best track .Only on this song do we get theold-school rootiness,Mary displayed on ""Mary"".Other than that,buy this album for a couple tracks but not for gritty soul."
2,Where's the Queen of Hip Hop/ Soul ?,"Basically, this is not an album that you can listen to from start to finish. However, this is an album that will grow on you if you continue to listen to it repeatedly."
1,absolute junk,I used this blender about 5 times before it started to smell burned just in making a simple smoothie. The lowest setting is much too powerful and it leaks everywhere no matter how well you tighten it. Absolute junk!
1,Good looking but a really bad blender,"I bought the blender thinking that Bosch made good products. Just like other reviews I quickly learned that opening the lid has a ""technique"" otherwise it is nearly impossible to open. As soon as I started using it I could smell an electrical burn. On the dial button I even saw internal sparks every time I started the blender. Now the button broke and it does not work at all.If you are even thinking about buying a blender do NOT buy this kind and Bosch for that matter. They make great power tools but this blender is something that they should be ashame of selling."
3,Use the Shopping Bag Method,"The book is full of examples from the author's experience and practice. Therefore each and every step may not apply to you. But, the pattern used in the exercises is intended to stimulate brainstorming or mindmapping about your special skills and who would be needing them. Use the shopping bag method; take what makes sense to you and use it; leave the rest on the shelf and don't worry about it.A niche can be just a niche or it can be profitable. Just grabbing a field or a target market doesn't often become a profitable niche. But anything is practice and learning. Most niches I've seen are followed by people with a specialty who can then specifically meet the need of their clients or customers.I don't know what happened with the copy mentioned that has multiple errors. My copy didn't have that problem.This book isn't going to ""do it for you"" but is intended to stimulate you to get busy and do it yourself."
3,Fascinating surreal images coupled with lack of substance,Dream Pools and Gardens does not supply any intelligible narrative and merely bombards the mind with image after image of mind-boggling pools. Was that the book's original purpose and goal? I certainly hope so.
2,Nice to look at but has errors,"This book is certainly well illlustrated, but I found a number of errors. Most were simply captions which had been switched between adjacent glyph illustrations. Therefore do not rely on the glyph identifications in this book. On the other hand, if you do not intend to try find any of the glyphs in real inscriptions, this may not be such a problem."
3,"Great knives, block broken",The knives themselves are sharp and great- however I received them yesterday and the block was split down the back.
4,Worth Tracking Down,"Though I believe this book has long since gone out-of-print, it is worth your while to track it down. Bell covers revolts in South Africa, Northern Ireland, Palestine, Egypt, Kenya, and Malaysia. But he also discusses how revolt works and why groups feel the need to rebel against their governments in the first place. The contents are divided into four parts: Revolts & Strategies of National Liberation, Revolts Against the Crown, On Revolt- Matrix, Models, and a Template, and The Rebel Vocation. Bell focuses particularly on revolts against the British Empire and the collapse of British power over the last century. The book was published in 1976 so obviously it is rather out-of-date but Bell's theories are still solid and do pass the proverbial test of time. I would highly recommend it to any student of history, government, and/or political science and I have personally found it very useful as a research tool."
4,Very warm mic.,"I've owned this mic since May 2010. I was setting up a small studio then and I didn't have much money to work with. To be honest, there are better sounding mics around but for me, this one worked because it's got a clear sound and it sounds a bit warm. I had real pros listen to the recordings I made with this mic and the first thing he said was that the mic was 'quite warm' which is a compliment. He also said it was a good mic. I've never had technical problems with this mic and I'd buy it again if I had to."
5,The Ghost Wore Gray,i liked it alot but they could lighten it up with some scary pictures in the book. I visualise all my book that i read. through the whole book i viualised the cover. so what im saying is to add a little more fun!!(pictures)
4,"Good reference for NIS+, if you have run NIS(yp) before.","The first half of the book is an very good resource in helping you to learn some of the in's and out's of NIS+. The only problem I have with the first half is the fact that it is slanted for use in an existing NIS network. The last half consists of step by step procedures in setting up NIS+ and administrative tips for NIS+. These would be great, except for the simple fact that some of the commands listed in the setup portion simply do not work. The book is up to date if you are running Solaris 2.3 thru 2.5, but not for 2.6 or Solaris 7. The book needs another revision."
2,Over Priced,"Unless you are a serious restorer and/or collector of bamboo rods, this reference manual is still over priced at $75-100 for the 2006 printing. The 1994 printing sells for up to $175. You can buy a nice bamboo rod for under $200.Useful restoration information can be found in many other publications and sources for far less money."
5,"It Can, Indeed, Change Your Life","This book works on a whole other level than your intellectual mind. It is difficult to read at times, but I have felt a definite shift in consciousness as I've kept with it. Everytime I reread a section it makes more sense, almost as if by magic.The key here is to not think. Anderson talks about the Subconscious Mind. I believe this book is worded in such a way that it speaks directly to the Subconscious Mind, rather than the Conscious, and that's why it can be difficult to take in intellectually at times.All I can say is, my life is rapidly changing for the better. It's mainly inattitude right now, but that's huge.And, I wish all the people snapping up the new Law of Attraction materials would read this first. It's all there. Anything more is just the Conscious Mind wanting to reason it all out. This is the original ""Secret"", no doubt about it."
5,three magic words,Interesting book. The principals could be used in real life and I think that it really works. I recommend it.
2,Why update this opera when it's so seldom done at all?,The Met has never done La Rondine in my lifetime of 60 years. Why they decided to stage it and update it is beyond me. It would have been nice to first see it in the period in which it is written before seeing a re-interpretation but decision at The Met make no sense whatsoever. Mr. and Mrs. Alagna are the big draw here and I have to say they are not my favorite for this opera. She acts the part very well but there's a sub-Callas flutter in her voice that I don't find appealing and frankly the tone of her voice is more serviceable than glorious. I vastly prefer Kiri Te Kanawa and Anna Moffo on audio recordings. Roberto is generally in good voice but he stills sings sharp and then flat at times. The direction of this video is stodgy. It's as if live television direction hasn't changed in twenty five years. I do wish Alan Skoog had been available for this one.
3,the human condition,"astrid's world is stark white with shades of blue. the real world seems overly bright and painted. that is all the movie is able to capture. the actresses were all well chosen and they are actresses i admire. but their scenes are too short and the tension and pain never has enough time to build. if given the chance, i think they would have brought the characters to life. i could taste the blood and the tears when i read the book. but the movie made things ""nice"". except maybe the scenes with claire. they gave renee zellweger enough to work with. even ingrid is nice although there are moments. her words aren't as sharp. she doesn't make astrid bleed like she does in the book. even though some of the dialogue was taken word for word, too many important things were left out and they feel dull. i don't know what more they could have done with the time restrictions. but my advice ... read the book."
4,Excellent performances carry this film,"I haven't read the book this film was based on, so I can only judge it on its own merits. I thought it was very good. All the performances are excellent, especially Alison Lohman's, who, as the main character Astrid, carries the film with a subtle and mature performance. Michelle Pfeiffer, however, steals every scene she's in with her portrayal of Astrid's manipulative and vicious mother. Robin Wright Penn, Ren√©e Zellweger and Patrick Fugit all do a good job portraying the characters Astrid meets while navigating through the foster care system. The film could easily have been cheesy and melodramatic, but the script and direction keep it grounded in reality, which makes Astrid's story all the more riveting."
1,A horrible adaptation,"I loved the book version of this movie but when I was done watching it, I was rather upset. They had taken away the emotional depth of this story. They had sucked away the vibrancy of the characters and taken away important plot arcs that had made the story so good in the first place. Ingrid, who was my favorite character had became the water downed version of herself. Overall, I hated this movie."
2,Bad movie!,"This movie was very superficial, we don't feel it real, it go to one situation to another without exploring it enough."
1,White Noise,"If you are a guy, never watch this movie. NEVER! If you are a guy who has seen it, and enjoyed it even remotely, you need to do some soul searching."
4,Skyraider,This isn't a novel. It does have lots of information on uses of the A1 Skyraider. I happen to love the plane so it was good for me to read. I saw them on the Kitty Hawk during the Vietnam war and was instantly smitten. The A1 is arguably the best bang for the buck the US government ever got on any weapon system. This book tells about how that system worked and held up in the horribly cold winters of Korea. If you love A1s it's a good read. If you're looking for a novel it's not for you.
2,Great sound but already broken!,"I purchased this headset less than a month ago. I use it to Skype for work. The sound quality was good while it lasted. It seems to no longer work. I can still hear the other people on the call, but no one can hear me.We've run tons of diagnostics and tried it on different computers but it is not functioning anymore.I'm going to try to get a refund. I'm really disappointed!"
3,If The Truth Be Told,"I wasn't too inpressed with this cd ""Simply Soul"" as I was with the ""Truth Be Told"". I would rate the ""Truth Be Told"" Two thumbs up! The CD is awesome!!!! I mean Awesome!!! If I break or lose the Truth Be Told CD Yes, in a New York Minute I would re-order it again from Amazon. This cd must be a part of your CD collection!! I have all of Vick Allen's CDs. I buy 90% of my music and movies from Amazon. I found Amazon is A Great Company to order music, DVDs and electronics!!"
1,"Recondition, or simply looked over?","I recently purchased the Kitchen Aid rrk 1500b, The first time I used it the gears broke down after 3 minutes of grinding chicken. That tells me that they never did take this machine appart and recondition it, they turned it on and repackaged once they saw it worked.That is simply unacceptable procedure, and Kitchen Aid should be ashamed of themselves. I have waited 10 years to be able to buy this machine, and now I am really angry,and doubtful that I will recomend it to any one of my friend.CAVEAT EMPTOR---"
1,DID NOT Arrive-did not show u on my account except my CC,This is a lousey place to buy from because you have not recourse to call anyone and find out about your product. IT did not show up on my account or things that were shipped-so I do not know if it is coming or not and the same with the breadmaker. I think this site needs a phone number that we can call and find out what is going on!!!!!! I am very tired of waiting and being in space and not knowing what is going on. Why are not all my purchases on my account? Who can I get in touch with to find out about them - I really want my mixer and my bread machine and it says on the screen that I bought them so why are they not here and why are they not showing up???
5,Refurbished is the way to go,"There is no doubting the quality of the KitchenAid stand mixer, but I was admittedly skeptical when placing my order for a refurbished model. I was pleasantly surprised that the only indication was the voided 12-month warranty in the handbook. My mixer arrived in absolutely perfect condition--cosmetically and mechanically. It looked like it had never been taken out of the box. The biggest drawback for a refurbished model is a loss of 6 months of warranty coverage, which seems minimal over the long predicted life of the machine. With the free shipping, you'll save a bundle over the original cost."
5,Super--,"This item in Almond Cream is lovely and came without a scratch on it. It was in pristine condition when I received it and works extremely well. Also, the delivery time was very prompt. I would order this way again because the experience was so pleasant."
5,proud owner,"I just recived my KitchenAid mixer and I'm so pleased. It's beautiful, not a blemish on it!! I've been wanting one for ages but couldn't justify the money for the amount of mixing I do. Getting one refurbished and on sale to boot was a perfect compromise for me. I would advise anyone that's been on the fence about buying one to snap it up now."
4,"Great machine, great price","Although not a huge motor, this machine does great not only for home use; but this is the 3rd one I've bought in the past few years for restaurants I work in. If you're going to make a lot of bread doughs or do a lot of grinding you'll probably want the bigger motor; but otherwise this one should do everything you want.Great price, wide variety of colors (I personbally love the chrome color...hides small stains/dust well."
5,Love it! Best Christmas gift ever!,"I made cookies, pound cakes, bundt cakes, pizza dough, bread, biscuits, whipping cream...I have never so enjoyed cooking, baking and bread making!"
3,Beta by a different name,"Beta Band albums were always inconsistent and the same goes for the solo work of their former leader, Steve Mason, aka King Biscuit Time. KBT's debut Ep, No Style, had two stellar tracks and the rest was filler. And Black Gold, the first full-length, is in about the same place. The weakest song is the opener (and also, apparently, the first single), ""C I Am 15,"" - the track is going nowhere to begin with, but the lame guest rap that comes in at the end brings it to a new level of weakness, and is actually kind of embarrassing. The best of Black Gold is the three-song run of tracks 6-8, all slow, dreamy ballads with fat, lazy beats and anthemic vocals - all qualities contained in the best Beta Band songs. When you finish listening to this album you are left with the feeling that it was kind of tired. But if you go back and listen to just the few best songs, you start to believe again. I always felt the same way about Beta Band albums."
2,Not quite matched,"I'm not exactly sure what the tolerance is on ""matched quads"" of tubes. From what I've read they should be within half a mV of each other. After spending an afternoon swapping all four around to get the best possible match, I still had differences of 4 to 5 millivolts as opposed to .4 or .5 mV. I won't be buying from these guys again."
5,Great Gift,This is a really nice breacelet and is of realitivly good quality for the price. The only thing is the heart links aren't actually as big as they look in the picture.
3,So So,I like a few songson this CD will not be an all time favorite.. I should have sampled entire CD before buying
4,original and cute,"I got baby frog pendant first - it looked nice and I LOOve malachite and I would give it 10 stars if I could. This is one beatiful Piece- heavy malachite bead and so detailed animal I got many-many compliments. When I saw earings I had to get them. The only reason I give them four stars, it's hooks - too thin, I almost lost them when I put it on for the first time. You have to get plastic stopers (.50 in any jewlery store)"
5,An excellent peek at Hemmingway & WWII via Cuba.,"I enjoyed this excellent novel but do not, as the previous reviewers, intend to write a novel describing why...Just buy it and enjoy!"
5,Incredible book,"This book has absolutely changed the way I view myself and relationships. The second half is less helpful for personal growth (much more therapist-specific), but the first part is - wow, totally perspective changing. This book will help you figure out the self-other boundary and how crucial it is for relationships. Not just for married couples, and not even for those in relationships - I read it as a single lady. ""Narcissism"" here isn't the egotistical, over-confident and arrogant narcissism, but the narcissism where we see the world within the lenses we ourselves have developed, and view everyone's actions as radiating towards us. In other words - no one is out to get us, they are just living their own lives! Ahhh just read it for yourself!"
5,Narcissism and Intimacy,Narcissism is a condition that even the most knowledable professional will have a great difficulty treating and helping. This book is helpful for those looking for answers.
4,Not a Country Music Fan But Keith Urban Rocks!,"I am a rock music fan who enjoys songs from the Beatles to AudioSlave. I've never been a fan of country music, however, my wife had been listening to some recently when she asked for this CD for her birthday. Well, after listening to it with her, I found myself taking it with me in my car and she hasn't gotten it back yet. Keith is an extremely talented musician and his song choices are top notch. I've since purchased most of his other CDs and highly recommend this CD. Keith Urban may be a Country Music artist....but his music Rocks!"
5,Be Here ! Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE all of Keith Urbans CD's. But with the release of each you are blessed with an even better album. He is an exceptionally gifted artist, who's guitar skills are next to none. This album will truly take you to another place; evoking emotions you may have been out of touch with. It forces you to look at things for anothers perspective. He has shown tremendous growth in the last few years and we will only continue to see more of the real Keith in the years to come. I think the vast majority of us can relate to his songs. I find each to be thought provoking, life changing. He has a real gift not just for his superior voice and guitar playing ability, but for song writing! He is really in touch with his feelings and that of his fans. It will only get better. Enjoy - Be Here! If you haven't purchased it yet, do so. You will be glad you did."
4,Listen to it over and over and over...,"When i first listened to this CD, i thought that it wasnt as good as Golden Road, so i put it away. But after i went to his concert, i pulled this CD back out. And i do love it!!! It pleases the senses, and I dont even listen to country music. Keith Urban is another artist to cross that great divide and make it that much smaller."
5,Great CD!,"Most of the CD's I buy these days are only to get one song. I bought this disc a little over a year ago for the song ""Your Woman"" thinking that this was the only song I'd like. Wrong!! The entire CD is highly listenable. It is one of the few CD's that I regularly get out and give a spin. The songwriting is very good, the electronic sounds scattered about the disc are awsome."
2,One struggles to choose their most compelling fault,"One struggles, in fact, to choose the most compelling of its faults. Is it the cheesiness? The rickety, tinny sonics? The smothering banality of it all?""Your Woman"" is the only interesting track.Indeed, the only way this CD could be more irritating is if you had to watch the band play it live!"
3,Perfect,I was happy with this light. I wanted it for my coat closet and it is perfect. I have enough room to see what I am doing and have the light to see what I am doing. I recommend it for small areas.
4,Computer Science graduates please read,"Thorough but readable reference book for developers who have a clear idea of how to code, but may not have thought about all the supporting activities and tools to help do them. Probably more appropriate for new developers just out of university, where computer science, but not necessarily software development, is taught. Written for developers in small companies, but addresses same topics that apply in large companies too."
2,Picture of everyday confusion & fears of the 1917 revolution,"This day-to-day diary of the confusion and fears that confronted those who lived through Russia's revolutions and their aftermaths in 1917-19 is well worth reading. However, it has its frustrations, especially a) the unremitting tone of hauteur by this right-wing, upper class novelist when confronted by the ascendant working class, and b) the editor's feeling that every rumor reported by Bunin, no matter how outlandish (St. Petersburg has fallen to the Germans; ""The Red Army has been chased from Russia"") requires his footnote assuring us that ""The rumor was not true"". Although both are very different in focus from this book, I much preferred Bulgakov's The White Guard, an autobiographically fictional account of his life during the same time period, with the same confusion, in Kiev, and Sukhanov's The Russian Revolution, 1917, an almost hour-by-hour description of the actual government takeovers in 1917."
5,A story of paradox,"It's one thing to hold ideals inside, yet quite another to live them out in the world. Heather Gemmen is forced to move beyond ideology into real life. I prefer nonfiction because the truth is more surprising and unbelievable every time.Sadly, Heather and her husband went their separate ways. One has to wonder how much these events contributed to the unraveling, though in the book they seemed solid.This book touches on so many different issues. Not an easy read, but valuable and ultimately inspiring."
4,Never too late to review this,"This album is great, not her best, but what can you expect after you stop working with Puffy, who helped shaped My Life into a classic? Yeah, Puffy's not on here and there are times when his presence is SORELY missed, like on those ""we-are-the-world"" type songs ""Keep Your Head"" and ""Love is All We Need"". On the other hand, on the ballads, she's as good as ever, with ""It's On"" (featuring R. Kelly), and on the two best tracks, ""Missing You"" and ""7 Days"". Yeah, this album is pretty solid, but Ms. Blige could do better, and she did in the years to come."
4,Lunch with a legend,"John Feinstein's books have been more miss than hit this decade, which is why it's a pleasure to go back and read one of his gems. This time his subject is Red Auerbach, the long time coach/GM of the Boston Celtics, and the man who has more championship rings than anyone in the history of the game. The book is basically a collection of Red's favorite Celtics anecdotes, which he often told over lunch to a select group of friends at his favorite Chinese restaurant The China Doll in Washington D.C. (now closed) The book is written in a breezy, conversational style, which will make you feel as though you are seated next to Red at the table as he holds court.Let Me Tell You A Story is a must-read, and will be of specific interest to Celtics fans, but should have something to offer general basketball fans as well. However, if you are a fan of the Lakers, Knicks, or Bulls, you might not like what Red has to say about your team ;)"
5,Thank God for Air America,I've been listening to Air America since day one. I tuned in for Al Franken but kept coming back for Randi Rhodes. She is the true star of Air America and probably the most brilliant commentator in the country. I listen in Los Angeles on KTLK AM-1150 every single day. If you want to know how this whole thing started pick up the book.
5,Great item,"Great item for the price....I replace wheels on my hand truck, worked well and definately affordable! Recommend for wheel affordable replacements!"
5,Great Deal,I am restoring an old wagon for my grandson. Thinking air tires would be a great way to up date my wagon.I began looking for air tires at all the chain hardware stores only to find that my up date will cost around $100.I found these tires sold through amazon at 1/4 the cost with the exact quality. They arrived quickly.The wagon is finished and I can not wait to give it to my grandson.
4,"They work well, but smell a bit funky","Not much to say. These assemblies have held their pressure now for three months and spin well on their built-in bearings. They show no signs of leaking. On the downside, they have a synthetic rubber odor that I still smell every time I go near the end of the garage where they are stored. The rims and hubs are unpainted. Overall, I'd say they are good value for the price."
4,Necro tones it down a bit,"Necro is an underground hip-hop legend, a hard working MC who blends his love of heavy metal, horror movies and hip-hop in a unique way and has been doing so for years. ""Death Rap"" is Necro's fifth full length album and his first to be distributed by Koch Records. Overall, this album is violent as expected, but not quite as lyrically shocking as his previous albums. The beats are great with a little more substance than before. Live drums, bass and guitar give the album almost a bit of a band sound at times. The lyrics are well written and Necro's vocals are at their best. The only reason this album gets 4 stars is because of the length. 37 minutes is just way too short, most songs are 2-3 minutes long and end too early. Anyway, if you like Necro get this disc."
4,Magic personified in lyric story,"Richard Francis Burton was essentially the first to produce an unexpurgated translation of this wonderful book of tales. Though Burton's English is often excessively stilted, Jack Zipes has quite handily adapted (and condensed from the original 10 volumes) this magical grouping of stories, as told by the enchanting Scheherazade, who tells the nightly tales to save her own life. A classic and must have for anyone's library."
5,Chilling memories,"Like a previous reviewer, I first read this book when I was younger...in fourth grade, in fact.I have always been a fan of monsters and horror films, so this book of short stories particularly held my interest.Each story is interesting, imaginative, and unique. Although not as explicitly graphic as certain horror novels released today, this is definitely not a ""children's book."" The stories contain supernatural imagery and suspense that might not sit well with younger (< 10 years) readers. I particularly liked and was scared by ""Precious Bodily Fluids"" by Mario Martin, Jr. and found myself checking my basement for vampires. The other stories are equally compelling.Unfortunately, it appears this book is no longer in print. I recommend purchasing it if you happen upon a copy...I know I will."
5,cheyenne complete 1st series,i remember cheyenne when i was a kid jn the 50s loved the show great to see the big guy back in action as cheyenne a must for fans of the old western series of the 50s and 60s good interview at the end of last dvd cant wait for series 2 highly recommended
5,cheyenne,Cheyenne is one of my favorite long running westerns.It ran for 8yrs. I wish they would make the other seasons. Brings back memories!
4,Cheyene-The Complete First Season,I have really enjoyed watching Cheyene. It brings back happy memories of childhood where the good guy always wins.
2,dissapointing,"I was really disappointed with the DVD that I ordered . The info is very basic and is just right for beginners . I thought that there will be a lot more insights into what the photographer has discovered , but the photography has been explained with tame and circus animals . Definitely need to be marked as a beginners guide to wildlife photography . All the right things but too basic . Would have spent my 22 dollars in a better manner ."
4,Great Value,"This DVD is great for beginners and a good refresher of the basics for everyone. It nicely complements ""The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography"". A great value for the price."
2,Light duty only,"Purchased 10 of these units - returned 2 due to missing parts(!). Used with 36"" plastic flower beds - really a typical implementation for this holder. Craftsmanship of product is good, design and material are poor. The depth of the holder is roughly 9"" and most flower boxes are 6"". Thus, the flower box will slide forward away from where the mounts are located - and the holder fails, bending badly and dropping the box (needed to construct a simple bracket that keeps the flower box pressed back against the back of the mount. The mounting bracket is in two pieces and comes with aluminum pan head screws and plastic/nylon nuts - pretty useless. Had to purchase additional bolts, washers and nuts.Am now adding forged metal brackets under each holder to stop them from failing; bending over and dropping the plants after (moderate/normal) watering.Overall the holders are for light duty only. Hopefully the manufacturer will correct the design."
4,Very nice reference of Calvin line furnitures.,Very nice reference of Calvin line furnitures. Only B&W photos. No planner group line furnitures covered. If you want to know about Calvin pieces this book is for you.
1,Poor Quality,"In less than two months of use, one of the lower strap retaining ring retainer broke. Leaving only the top strap to secure the shoe."
3,Feels Good,I found these shoes were fairly comfortable. In the past I have had trouble with steel toes but I don't have any issues wearing these for a full day at work. I have not had an opportunity to test the ESD compliance so I can not give any information concerning that aspect of the product.
4,excellent quick-and-dirty handbook,This tiny little book provides an excellent short but surprisingly thorough overview of what one needs to know about business etiquette. Kennedy does a good job of bringing traditional etiquette into today's world without resorting to sarcasm and without losing the small niceties that are the mark of good manners. I now use this book as a text in introductory public communication courses to guide freshman in understanding appropriate professional behavior. It's the best brief etiquette book out there.
5,The best way to experience Isla Mujeres is with this map!,"Though there are a couple of ""maps"" available and Isla Mujeres is usually covered a page or two in Cancun travel guides, the Can-Do Guidebook in a Map provides more useful information plus the best map over anything else available. It folds to fit in a pocket and is great for exploring by golf cart (the preferred family travel mode on the island). References and recommendations are all good. The whole island is covered, plus other nearby attractions. My only complaint is our copy blew away and was lost (don't leave it on the seat of your gold cart)!"
3,"Good size, travels well.",This is a good size cooler that travels well.It did not keep ice frozen quite as well as I would have hoped.Overall a good purchase for a larger cooler.
4,"Sturdy cooler, but think if the cube design is right for you","The cooler is great. Keeps food cold for many days when we went camping, didn't even have to get another bag of ice. Wheels were a must for us. Handles are nice for picking up too.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was in the cube design. After using it a few times, I have realized because the cooler is taller than the normal rectangle style cooler, the stuff on bottom gets trapped more easily by the items on top, so you spend longer digging through the freezing ice trying to find items. Just something to consider before you buy. I would probably still but this again because the cube is more portable compared to the long rectangle coolers."
5,Keeps Cool Beautifully,"I purchased this cooler for a week-long camping trip in August, and it did a great job. I went through half as much ice as with my old cooler, and it maintained the cool temp inside even when the ice was gone and the cold water drained out. It's attractive, rolls easily and drains thoroughly. I am very pleased with this - excellent investment!"
2,Left me rather confused on at least 2 different chapters,"I did not feel prepared to take the certification exam after reading this book. It left me foggy on an understanding of WINS and DNS. I subsequently bought and read the New Riders ""Networking with Microsoft TCP/IP - Certified Administrator's Resource Edition."" That book is much clearer."
2,Very poorly written. Confusing and contradictory.,This book has many errors and contradicts itself sometimes within the same paragraph. This book confuses more than clarifies.
1,Misguiding and not complete,"In preperation for the TCPIP Exam I read both the Sybex book and the Microsoft Press book.I first read the Sybex book and was left confussed at the end of it, with lots of information missing.I then read the Microsoft Press book and found it clear and precise.Microsofts one was to the point and gave hardcore facts. The Sybex book left a lot to be desired, and went on about 'nothings'. A few sections I was having trouble with only had brief, simple examples you could not work with.If TCP/IP is new to you, I suggest you stay away from this book, until Sybex release a new, updated version."
5,"Like the other reviews on this page, buy this book","I looked through the mixed reviews and noticed that some people were complaining about the writing style or errors. No one mentioned that they couldn't pass the test when they bought the book. I bought the book and guess what? I passed the test with a 938 on the first try. I would say the authors did what they were suppose to do. I have bought other Sybex books and they helped me pass my tests, but not as well as this one did. If you want to pass the TCP/IP test, you need this book!"
2,Book does not prepare you for Microsoft Exam,"The subnetting chapter looks like it was written in a hurry. The book has only a small section on TCP/IP for NT4, and a lot of the questions that are asked on the Microsoft exams couldn't be adequately answered by reading this book. My opinion only."
1,Average Book,"This book is at best an average book, it has adequate coverage of the topics, but there are better books on the subject"
1,I didn't like the book.,"I bought the book because of exceptional ratings here. But to my surprise, this is simply no good. Explanation on some of important issues including WINS, DNS, Subnetting, Supernetting, etc was so vague and hard to get anything out of it.I especially disliked the way authors described things here. It made me wonder sometimes what am I actually reading and made me stay out of focus on the topics. I really don't believe this book will contribute anything to my MCSE pursuit, for this book made me lose my interest on NT TCP/IP. I am kind of angry now about what I paid for this book. I just can not trust reviews here in Amazon.com."
2,Incomplete at best.,I just failed the TCP/IP test and I'm disappointed that this book did such a poor job of covering sub-netting and remote connection. I'm writing a letter to the company and suggesting that they revise the book. Based on my experience I would not recommend the purchase of this book.
2,Not very realistic but okay for an afternoon read,"In my opinion, for Katherine to have taken such drastic measures to protect her niece, Allison, she trusted Jace Manning way to much. Personally, if this was reality, the moment Jace knocked on the door, I would have collected the baby and went running. But even being fiction, the quick first kiss, his moving in, the marriage, was a bit much. Then the fact that the grandparents are pretty much dropped from the story line was pretty disappointing. I was expecting a little more especially after their wayword son, Jace, was the center of the fiasco. Okay book, if you need something to do for an afternoon."
2,Weak product,"Hey, these gloves are pretty weak. If you need a pair to use for one or maybe at most two days, then fine, get these. If you need a decent pair of work gloves, don't buy these. The material is just too thin. I wore through a finger in about 6 hours of use."
2,not worth it,"I bought this jump rope at TJ Maxx for about $6. The price wasnt bad, but the rope broke on me in 3 weeks. i would buy a real speed rope or something different"
4,Beautiful Recording,"An overall beautiful recording of a notoriously difficult piece of work. The Chorus were outstanding and the Orchestra flawless under the lead of the late Maestro Ken Schermerhorn.My only mild critisism is of soprano Lori Phillips whose voice, I find, has slightly more vibrato and less control than I enjoy. It made for a rather harsh Benedictus, which has always been the highlight of the Missa Solemnis for me (This was exquisitely performed by Gundula Janowitz in von Karajan's version).Other than that, a wonderful interpretation of the work and a steal at the price."
4,Very cool experimental filmmaking,"The movies on this DVD show the power of Caeser Pink's experimental films. The themes range from politics to sexuality, humor, spirituality, and angst. The film techniques are really innovative for underground-low-budget filmmaking. America and Easter are incredibly powerful. There is an intensity to Caeser Pink's work that really moves me when its at it best."
5,Good price and Long Life too,I just purchased these halogen floods for my new range hood which came without any bulbs. I like the 130 volt rating for longer life when operated at 120 volts. I needed 2 but purchased 4 for the free shipping and for spares. They are great so far and cost less than purchasing 120 volt bulbs locally (130 volt rated bulbs not locally available).
2,"Good Information, Badly Written","If, like me, you want to know as much as you can about Dylan's recordings, you have to get a copy of this. But that means reading endless badly-written diatribes against Dylan and whomever else Heylin dislikes. Apparently, it's okay for Heylin to prefer the original ""Blood on the Tracks"" recordings, but for Greil Marcus to prefer the acoustic ""Blind Willie McTell"" is, to quote Heylin, ""wrong."""
5,THE BEST CHRISTIAN BOOK FOR YOUNG ADULTS!,"This book was absolutly wonderful. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have definetly done it again! With a tasteful storyline, the Young Tribulation Force continues their lives after the Rapture. A must have for all Christian Youth. Recommend this book to all your friends,family, and neighbors! If you are looking for a tasteful Christian book series, you've found it!"
1,Never again,"I have 4 a natural hair. I have tried it as a moisturizer on wet hair: a real mess,it had a gel like feeling and it just sat on my hair, made my ends incredibly tangled. Luckily for me, I was just given a sample to try it. This is definitely not for me,ever again."
2,"fake Beatles, tinny, and cheaply made","cheaply made for the price. works good enough, but still expected better for the costs. Beatles music is by knockoffs."
5,Is it the same?,"Hey Scipio, hope you liked Guam while you were here. I'm still hanging at the base club on Soul Night. It's the only place I can hear my Zapp song. Does anyone know if the Zapp 3 CD listed is the same as Zapp III? mhyschelle@hotmail.com"
2,don't expect anything but a debate in a book,"this is definitely not ""I was there and this is exactly what happened"" type of book. While I am perplexed as to why it got such high marks, it must be that those readers enjoy the author ""debating"" issues, and telling how bad it was, over, and over, and over..... there are very few interesting details of the actual battle. If you are looking for a true account of the battle, as it happened, this isn't it. It's very dry, boring, and I finally gave up reading it. It probably doesn't deserve even a 2 star rating. If you like repetition, debate, talking things over a few hundred times, buy it."
4,Something Different From Busdriver,"This album is not like other busdriver albums - but then again, no two busdriver albums are the same. This one features more melody and less frenetic rap than most of his recordings. The single Sun Showers stands out as a great song, but unfortunately it is unique on this album. The rest of the songs feature more rapping and less singing, but still sit somewhere on the fence between genres. This album is catchy and full of intelligent wordplay, but it is too short to fully satisfy - I think it could use one more track that busdriver sings on - or maybe it's just that I can't get over SunShowers."
4,Great earphone with a fundamental flaw,"The sound quality is great and crystal clear. I can hear the background noise of my favorite radio station I did not notice before. (not sure it is a good thing) I also found it is more comfortable with the form insert.But a fundamental flaw is every time you move your head, you hear the noise the cord moves against your clothes or skin. I guess the principle is similar to a physician's ????scope (forgive my limited vocabulary). The sound is perfect if you can keep your head still :-)"
3,Earphones That Changed My Life!,"I have never been able to listen to my music without outside noise interfering: tv, phone calls,, people talking loudly. These little earphones changed all that.For the first time, I can enjoy my mini-ipod any time; any place, These EC3 earphones are in-ear units which really do eliminate the outside noise while making the music sound even better! They are useable everywhere because they are lightweight, and the cord is in the back. I only wish that I'd had them years ago. My EC3 earphones changed my life! A happy user."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I've had these headphones just over a year and have never been happy with them. The sound is great, there's no arguing about that, but my primary complaint is that they hurt my ears. None of the earpieces were comfortable, except the foam ones, and they get dirty quickly. Forget about wearing these earphones to the gym or doing any exercise with any of the earpieces. The gray earpieces actually slipped off in my ear when I removed the earbuds once. I got it out myself, but was still concerned.My second complaint is that the volume is usually too loud. The lowest volume setting (above totally muted) on my computer and my iPod (two different models) is too loud when using these. I don't need excessive volume to hear.Next, they didn't last. The left earbud just stopped working after a little over a year. At the price, I expected these to last several years. I wouldn't buy them again, nor would I recommend them."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Okay, the sound on these ear buds is quite good, but if you're a commuter who expects these buds to stay in your ears for an hour or more as the cable is gently tugged and pulled by your jacket, arm or whatever, this is NOT the product for you!If you're going to use this product in your favorite chair and not moving around much, then this just might be the product you seek.I tried every ear fitting that comes with the ear buds and none of the options were able to keep the buds in place. Even the slightest tug of the cord caused the buds to pop out. VERY frustrating."
4,"Light, good fit, very good sound","I am buying my second pair of these. These headphones isolate sound, but do not completely block out the sound, with very good sound quality. I use these phones while I walk or jog the early morning streets. It is important that I am able to hear cars as they approach intersections. I listen to music or podcasts - these are not my high end set of phones - I have a traditional set of open ear phones (Grado SR125) that sound much better than the $500 level mini bud shures, at a cost of $150 retail.But these are for outside. I did break my first set, the earpiece tube is the weak link here. I did not put them into the carrying case the right way, and the zipper pressure must have snapped the earpiece tube. I usually keep these in a small drawstring pouch in my computer bag - I wish I did the day they broke."
4,Great for college dorm rooms!,"I just bought these headphones 2 days ago and I loved them!After I opened the annoying package (those plastic enclosure) and spent about an hour trying all the seals to see which one sounds better for me, I enjoyed these more than any headphones I have used bedore(comsumer level ones).The sound isolation is pretty good. While wearing it without playing music, I can barely hear my roommates talking (thats about 65~75db) and with ipods volume up to 1/3 of scale, I can't hear what they are talking! And these also effectively block out the traffic noises a window away from my dorm room. And, perfect for train, bus, metro, plane traveling too.One bad thing is that you have to get used to them. Trying to fit them in takes some time. And also you can hear your bodys sound while moving around. So I guess they are not very good for exercises. Anyway, at 150$ I think it will save me a lot of valuebla time studying or enjoing the DVDs on my laptop."
5,Can't beat the 2 year warranty,"I stepped on one of the earbuds, I slammed a door on the cable and got it yanked out of my ear several times. The sound became intermittent and finally cut out altogether. I sent them in for repair (sure!) and Shure! sent me a new pair.They reproduce music very well, and block out my noisy work environment extremely well. If you can get used to the plugs in your ear canals you will love these."
5,"Adorable, one-of-a-kind earrings","I couldn't resist these earrings! I love lapis and wear it all the time, and the ferrets sealed the deal; how many earrings do you find with ferrets?? The design is really great; the ferrets are much more delicate than they appear in the picture above. The little tails curled around the lapis balls are just adorable.As the earrings are quite small, a girl (perhaps eight and up) could also wear these. Any age will find these adorable. I'd buy them if I was you! Thank you, Silver Insanity. I'll definitely be checking out more of your jewelry."
5,GOOD!,"The book was great, could not put it down. Good horror novel that brings some nightmares. Future readers beware."
5,THIS SHOULD BE A MOVIE!,"I had no real expectations when I purchased this book. Hearing some people talking about it, I thought it may be a good read. I could not be any more surprised. This book makes you want to continue every waking moment. I read the first four chapters in one day! Finished the rest in the next couple of days. I must admit I didn't have to sleep with the lights on before, but that week was different. Maasi Smith tells a vivid story that seemed more movie than book. Mischiefmakers is scary yet an awsome read. My only disappointment is that this is his only novel. Hopefully another is on its way, he has earned the right to be one of may favorites. I never write reviews, but this book deserves it!"
4,"Sharp, Lightweight and Sturdy.",I would like to start by saying that SOG makes some pretty good blades. This Tactical hawk is no exception and in my eyes worth EVERY penny. Mine came packaged wonderfully and it came two or three days early to boot. The head on this weapon is a bit small by my standards but all in all a good design with good steel. The twin torx screws and metal pommel are enough to keep me content and feeling safe the head wont come apart anytime soon. Granted this design will not last forever but will serve its purpose. I would also like to say that this particular item is NOT a self defense or camping tool. Go to home depot if your looking for a tool to go chop wood and bang down doors. The tomahawk is a weapon and it should be respected as such.
3,Utilitarian yet cheap appearance,"Im mixed on this one. It is solid and balanced well, but feel cheap. The handle is fully synthetic, but they should have rubberized it. Last thing you want this type of tool to do is slip or rotate on you in use. I only paid $25 though which is not much for a tool like this."
3,the steel,"I got it for throwing. The handle and the way head is attached are good to go, really strong. I have issues with the soft stainless steel the head is made of. Its weak and dings bends and chips very easy. Would of been a better hawk if they used a high carbon steel over the soft stainless."
5,Great Tomahawk,This is a great tomahawk. The end of it is a short length and great for chopping small pieces of wood if that is what you would like to use it for. It has a great design and is easy to hold as it is very light. I would recommend this item because the design is awesome and it comes with a case for the blade which definitely makes it easy to store or pack with camping gear.
3,tomahawk,"Got it for a plaque for someone leaving my unit. So for that it was perfect, can't tell you how it performed physically."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,For the price I cant complain. It seems durable and good for hacking down some brush going through the woods. I havent thrown it and I cant wait to do so and if it does break then I will just have to spend MORE money on a better tomahawk
4,a steal of a buy,I love it! at first i didnt think i would be too impressed but i really like it!Me and my dad.compared our hawks...he has an old fashioned hickory handled hawk with just the axe blade and even he was impressed by this hawk! it sticks and throws nice...if i were you i would also buy a file incase you chip the edge up...love this tomahawk!
5,"The SOG F01T is a great, all round, utility tool",the tomahawk meets all my needs and desires for axe throwing and trail building while back packing. Three were given as gifts and the the recipients feel the same. Two more were purchased by a friend after using mine.
5,wow....nice hawk,"Im just very impressed with this item for the amount that I paid.....if you can get this hawk for less than 30 bucks, then you will not be disappointed.....and even if you had to pay more, I still think you would be happy.....get it..."
1,Do Not Buy This,"This tomahawk will break. I know two people beside myself who have bought this tomahawk, their's are broken too. The metal will bend and chip chopping soft sapplings, the handle will break if you chop something too hard. I guarantee it!Again,DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,"Nice, but somewhat cumbersome","I love the roller feature of this bag and there are a lot compartments for stuff. But with a laptop, office items, & a few clothes - it can be cumbersome and heavy. There is a sholder strap, but that's why I purchased one on wheels - my sholder was always in pain from carrying my laptop.I would recommend if you travel often, but just note that it's sometimes awakard to carry."
5,Amazing Performance!,One of the best concerts I've ever seen!Amazing guests and amazing to see how many hits David Foster has been involved with.With so many guest stars involved every song will keep you glued to the set.
5,"Favorite Concert, Play it Over and Over","By far, this is my favorite concert. Whenever I have guest over, I play this concert. By the time they leave, they want to buy one! Watching this on bluray on a 52"" LCD and surround sound, they are just amazed. To be able to hear every instrument playing along with great songs makes this concert great. Whenever you watch something over and over, it must be good!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BLUE-ray And one of the finest concerts todate,I'm quite adament if you havent herd this or seen the concert you are missing something special and in blue-ray superb mind you the DVD is very crisp and what audio yes 5 stars +
1,Nothing new here...,"This is a heavily derivative work, a rehash of existing biographies. The author does not speak Russian and cannot, then, offer us any new or original insights into Chekhov's life and work."
4,quick set,got this to replace the smaller one that came with my windshield works just as should was easy to in install
5,Lithium For Medea,"From start to finish Kate Braverman forces the reader into a fun house, a meat grinder, turning and forcing you to experience a well oiled intensity. At times the writing is caustic, biting and poisonous. Poison to the emotions, a drug that invokes passion. The atmosphere is vivid and surreal for the reader though, at times, not for the narrator. A superb book. Each line is finely tuned and crafted like music, rich in images and color like photography and still is able to shake the humanity through the novel. Highly recommended especially for other writers."
5,"A glorious ""Salsa Dura"" classic.","""Hasta Que Se Rompa El Cuero"", ""Madrugador"", ""Ahora Yo Me Rio"" and the timeless title track are prime examples of this dearly loved Puerto Rican salsa band at its best. Don't miss out on this important album--it's truly a ""Salsa Dura"" essential and an all-time classic."
3,OK KEEP GOING,"This book was ok but a bunch of things had changed. For one thing, Leap of Faith is NOT gray, she is a chestnut. For another thing, Sebreaze isn't a pony, she's a HORSE!! In some of the other new ones, well, first: -they called Dakota and Appendix Registered Quarter Horse -they called Seabreeze a Thoroughbred ""Off the Track"" -they called Seabreeze part Quarter/Thoroughbred -then all of a sudden, she's a pony!!!! The storyline of these books are better, but they REALLY need to keep the details straight!!!!"
3,"Readers, Don't Go Overboard","I Think that people are being a little too critical.You know what, I like Christina because she's real.I loved Ashleigh and Sam but they were perfect.They had no feelings at all.So lay off Christina OK? At least she's a real person. As for the reader from Oakland, ""like, Hello!"" she did win the Derby on Pride, Jilly wojn it on Wonder. But there is one important thing every author seems to be forgetting. Ashleigh won the TRIPLE CROWN on Champion, that's a little more important than the Derby and Preakness. But it's never been mentioned again????? I won't even ask what happened to Champion, he probably fell in the black hole with the others. So in conclusion I admit the books have a lot of holes, but lay off them a little"
5,"3rd in the ""Fairytale weddings"" trilogy.","Another lovely read in this series, I really enjoyed it. I was sad to see it end. Then I found out there are 2 more books in this series. Book 4 ""Bridegroom on approval"" is also book 2 in the series with the Salvatore brothers. Book 5 is ""Long-lost bride"".So before I read Bridegroom on approval, I will read book 1 of the Salvatore brothers series ""Who's holding the baby"". I hate reading series books out of order. You get so much more when there is more than one, catching up on old friends."
3,A good visual reference,"I bought this book ages ago and never understood it. Now, after working on the net, it all makes sense.In general, you will not understand the internet using this book, but it does makes a great prompt if you know it already. I keep it on my desk as work when I get a bit stuck visualising packet transfer etc.If you want to learn about how the internet works, this book is not for you as it covers too much information at one go without linking it together."
1,How the Internet Works,I was dissapointed. A lot of graphics but I did not learn much about the internet. Repeats itself over and over too.
2,very elementary and superficial,"This book has glitzy graphics. Reading it, I was not sure where it was headed. Nowhere in particular, it turned out. Each ""chapter"" has a page or two-long introduction followed by a couple of pages of illustrations breaking down the various aspects mentioned in the introduction. Could be a useful book for learning the jargon of the internet but nothing more. I was hoping for the nuts and bolts description, but most of it was superficial. Maybe a decent introductory book for someone who has just discovered the ""net""."
5,Fantastic reference.,The ZD Press and Preston Gralla have given me a fantastic source of reference for not only Internet but LAN/WAN architecture and function. The graphics make even complex protocols easy to understand. I use this as a companion text for my college networking textbook.
2,very unrealistic,"Not the premise that it's hard to say goodbye to a horse you love to the point where you may temporarily stop riding because it hurts so much. No, it's just that the horse in question is a STALLION. For a junior exhibitor. For one thing, riders who are under a certain age cannot compete on stallions (at least in most classes), so I guess Veronica had to be content with never showinig Cobalt. Also, she was scared of him and did not ride him well, so it is a surprise she did not get badly hurt earlier. Why, why, why, are stallions always the mount of choice for children and teens in books? Mares and geldings are just as capable of generating mystery and intrigue."
5,Goodbye Cobolt...,"Carole, Stevie, and Lisa on finally on the long awaited MTO! They have so much fun, they never want it to end. When they get back, though, Carole is given premission to take care of Veronica's beautiful stallion, Cobolt. Everything's perfect. That is, until Carole gets back from her vacation and is rushed to the barn. It's horrible when she gets there. Cobolt is dead.After the incident, Carole swears that she'll never ride again. Lisa and Stevie know that Carole loves horses too much to give them up forever. But what can they do?While this is all happening, Stevie and Lisa are keeping their promise and trying to find out who Max the first really was. The old man is impossible to find info on, though!Read this book if you want to read a sad, happy, fun, and mishcevious story. Great again, Ms. Bryant!"
4,excellent,"In a sense, this is more of the same, but with Gil, this is a good thing. The poetry jazz construct he always uses works like a charm, particularlly when you have players like the Midnight Band. If this unit had been used for top 40 session back up, it would have beens hits every time.This does have modern touches like raegee, and the production is more polished. But the music never loses its guts, and Heron had an ability to make his themes fresh and relevent, even when they are similar with every album."
3,No SDH captions!,"I usually love anything from England production companies, but I have noted they are sometimes lack in providing close-captioning (for the hearing impared) as is the case with the DVD. I purchased it and with no captions, I have to try to lip read the thing - hard enough even with modern pronunciations and full-face views. I think it is visually stunning, but I would have liked to have been able to parse out what they were saying half the time. Shame on the production company."
3,closed captioned,"Dammit, for those of us who are hearing challenged why mus the BBC continue in not providing closed captioned in their excellent cinemas...Damn! This is Mr. Meeks providing the review."
1,DIsjointed stories all in one,"This miniseries represents a disjointed collection of tales with poor character development. The tale includes trite ""1960's-like"" cinematic distortions in a dated attempt to convey cognitive dysfunction in a character or 2. Not worth more that $3 as a used dvd. You will not watch this more than once."
2,Disappointing,"BBC and William Golding? I thought it couldn't fail and yet it did. I should have read the book first; it might have spared me the movie. I suppose when it says, ""a voyage of SELF discovery"" I should have known better than to get it, but I missed that. I got ""The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant"" at the same time, which in comparison was riveting."
4,The flashcards are very helpful,"Excellent idea. The board won't last a lifetime, but made with decent material (that's what you paid for). Flashcards showing the moves are very helpful for learners."
2,"Misleading name, bogus concept.","From the description of this chess set you would think that the instructions and cards would teach you something about openings, strategy, defense, value of exchanges, etc.All it does is put how each piece moves on a bunch of cards and the premise is that you draw a card from the pile and move that piece now. With no regard to whether that makes sense.I had taught my daughter the moves and she was playing a decent beginner game after two days, and I thought this would teach her a little more.It includes a decent plastic set of chess pieces and an acceptable cheap cardboard chessboard. Save yourself about $5 and just get a board with pieces. This 'no-stress-chess' concept is obviously cooked up by some marketing person who doesn't even know how to play chess."
5,Great way to learn chess,I purchased this set to introduce chess to my 5 year old. After a few games she understands the basic concepts of piece placement and movement and now we're getting into strategy. I will admit that teaching strategy is mostly left up to the more experienced player as the cards and instructions will not teach that. It's great how you can make the game as simple or challenging as you like using the cards. The quality of the board and pieces are fine for the price and the intent of this set; not professional grade but certainly on par with other board game sets out there. Highly recommend.
5,The best game for beginners,"This really is the best game for beginners and advanced players. My daughter feels like she has a chance because I can't just clobber her at chess, but I actually have to work harder to win, without giving it away to her just to ""make her feel good about herself"" When she wins, she feels like she accomplished something...So do I for that matter! It levels the playing field without handing her the game. A great precurser to Solitaire Chess."
1,What a Crock!,This book demonstrates the sloppy scholarship of a high-school dropout. His theology was discarded by his organization as soon as the megalomaniac died. He was as wrong about history as he was about theology. It has also been disclosed that he copied much of this book from another author's earlier publication. This man has been discredited as a theologian long ago.
1,Very Disappointed,"The main problem with this book is that the references it sites are no longer valid. The addresses, web sites, phone numbers, etc. are not current. They may never have been from what I can tell. The second problem with this book is that it spends way too much time on ""motivational"" nonsense like ""you can do it!"", etc. The hard information is very scarce, and as I said before, is out of date and almost useless."
2,concerned about heat coming from battery compartment,"I had to return the 1st one I bought because the batteries were to the point of exploding from the heat. Now I find the other one I received is doing the same thing. The area where the batteries are, gets extemely hot if the batteries are left in this toy for extended periods of time. You should probably check it every day or so or remove the batteries completely."
4,"Innocent, genuine Hugo","I know that critics throw rotten cabbage at this book, but I find it charming and refreshing, with all of its imperfections and brutalities. This is the essential Hugo - NOT ""Les Mis"". Let's face it, Hugo is a romantic, and all of his attempts at realism and psychological accuracy have led to nothing but boredom. He tries the high moral ground in ""Les Mis"". The book came out tedious and preachy. ""Hans of Iceland"" offers the same kind of absurdity and brutality as ""Notre-Dame de Paris"" and ""The Man Who Laughs""."
3,Does not cover character animation to any significant degree,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to animate a character, as the title suggests. However, the book is more of a general reference of how to model, rig, skin, and create a character rather than animate a character.For example, it covers nothing about making a character move in a believable way, how to use the character controls effectively, or any suggestions on a good animation workflow (such as blocking in, then converting to spline keys).At the end of reading it you will have a fully created and rigged character but still not know how to animate it. The book should have been entitled Maya Character Creation and Rigging instead.That said, the material is very in-depth and nicely presented for what it does cover. The title's a bit misleading, that's all."
4,A Good Read...,"I like the book ""million dollar mate."" It is encouraging to someone who is single with people getting married all around. I would highly recommend it to anyone who isn't married, especially college age and beyond. And, honestly, the more desperate the single, the more applicable this book. The focus of this book is a nice change from the typical single young adult's fixation on the emotional side of being in love. I will confidently go on secure in the knowledge that God has a plan for me and my future mate. I now have a better idea of what I'm looking for, and who knows when that may come in useful."
5,Highly recommended for anyone in the dating scene,"Many people seem to take some wrong turns when looking for a lifelong, committed mate. As a result the divorce rate is well over fifty percent within the first ten years of a marriage. Although there are many reasons for this situation, one of them is basing a relationship on transient attractions. In his book ""Finding Your Million Dollar Mate"" author Randy Pope proposes a Biblically based system for dating.One of the high points of the book is his clear explanation and sound reasoning for why you should wait for the right person before engaging in sexual activity. In a world that supports sexual activity at earlier and earlier ages teenagers often don't want to accept ""because it's wrong"" as a reason for waiting. Randy Pope provides a positive answer for why you should wait. This book should be considered required reading for teenagers. ""Finding Your Million Dollar Mate"" is a highly recommended read."
3,Probably my fault...probably,"While visiting my brother, I tried his hair brush which was a Bass with bamboo bristles and also boar hair around the bamboo. It was a really sweet brush and I thought I'd order one as well. I knew he bought it on Amazon as we both buy most everything from them. I punched in what I thought was the correct model number and looked carefully at the one and only (tiny) photo. To me, it looked like what I was after.It was not. It only has the bamboo bristles. So, this brush is quite harsh on the scalp. I still use it and it does 'envigorate' the scalp. But it doesn't really work my hair around the way that my brother's Bass brush did. So, I guess I'll try again and pay more attention. But I wish the product photos were more plentiful and larger."
1,Definitely NOT a WIDU,"I have owned a WIDU hairbrush for the last 14 years. I LOVE IT. My 10 year old daughter shares my brush and asked for her own. I decided to see if this brush could compete with the more expensive Widu. It most definitely does not. The bristles are hard not like the bamboo bristles the Widu is made from. The handle of the brush is comfortable and sturdy but since the bristles are rough, it makes hair brushing uncomfortable. My daughter returned to using my WIDU brush. I wouldn't recommend this brush over the WIDU."
1,Great Idea poor execution,The idea of creating an underwater MP3 player with quality sound is far from a reality. This product is expensive and poorly constructed. The sound quality when you are able to keep the earplugs in your ear is extremely poor to non existent.
4,Great Minnesota Band!,"I had the chance to see this group perform live in Rochester, MN. They're siblings, which makes the group a little different. The drummer is the female, which makes them even more interesting. Their live performance was captivating. This album is quite good. There's a nice diverse selection of music on this album--one song doesn't sound like all the others. If you are into ""adult alternative""/pop music, check them out--I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Deep Behind Enemy Lines,"I looked all over for this game and finaly found it at a local retailer, sorry Amazon, but you didn't have it and the USED price was too high, for me.Anyway on to the reveiw, this game is as close as your ever gonna get to being behind Enemy lines with no one but you to CYA. Not only do you have to contend with regular troops but you have to deal with snipers, blowing newpapers, rats, dead ends that lead no where.The wildest thing I've come accross so far in the game is as your leaving the engagement area on one level your way is blocked by a truck with Russian guards. Seems our Rusky Friends don't want anyone to find out what they are doing.After you've taken out the troops take a few minuites to look around...these guys were loading paintings onto a stolen Nazi truck.How very very realistic!"
3,Mystery...but first let's shop!,"This is my first J.J. Mystery. I enjoyed reading about the apsects of the writers conference. But at times it felt like the decription of the conference was a primer for dunces on getting a book published, with Jane struggling over such issues as what cover is best to package your manuscript in (plain, not hot pink!)Several times the character says ""The conference goes on one day too long."" My God, if the characters in the novel think that things are dragging, how do you think we feel?As for the mystery. Well, I give the author credit for trying something a little different, and NOT jumping right into a corpse lying on the ground.And, finally, if the writer objects to having women's books labeled as ""Powder Puff Mysteries"" than she ought to keep her characters from going shopping every ten minutes!"
3,Disappointing.,"While I loved hearing the inside scoop on what goes on at a mystery conference, this was far from my favorite Jane Jeffry book. All the regular elements are there -- Jane and Shelley, a mystery, and interesting characters -- but the characters seem to trot in and out without much development. And Jane and Shelley seemed particularly catty in this book, especially in regards to judging others they come in contact with.The warmth of previous books is missing while the two wine and dine and shop (and make snarky remarks about their fellow attendees).The mystery is pretty transparent, too, and not even fully resolved at the end of the book.After looking forward to this one for so long, I was disappointed."
2,Disappointing - it's just lacking 'ooomph',"The more of her books I read, the less I like them. The characters do seem a little stiff and contrived, the dialogue just doesn't quite flow... It's like the author has fairly good ideas, but just can't sculpt them together into a really pleasing book. I have to say I like the stories, not the writing."
5,These guys rock!,"I have been a Pennywise fan for years, seen them at warped tours and other venues. This is just another awesome album done by these guys!"
2,Beatles Live in Tokyo 1966,"This DVD from a company called Fareast must be a bootleg recorded from some unknown source. The audio and video quality is poor, fuzzy, and foggy. The Beatles songs can barely be heard. There are not credits on the DVD or the box cover. The DVD does not have a chapter selection. At the end of my DVD rewrite maxnavox 8-11-2004 appears. My guess is someone from Thailand makes these DVD's, puts shrink wrap then markets as new. It is interesting to see the Beatles in concert but I was hoping for something with at least a small amount of quality. This is not it. I cannot believe some Amazon sellers want $40 or higher for this poor item."
4,Great book if you read it for an university course,"I think this is a good book if it is the textbook for a computer science course. It reads easily and I didn't find it boring at all since the subject interests me. The text starts with simple concepts and builds up to more advanced concepts, just like a text book is supposed to do.This book is probably not an easy read for non computer science people, the pace might be too slow for people who already know lots about operating systems, and it might not go into enough details, but this is all typical for a text book on such a broad subject. I give it 4 stars just because textbooks are so overpriced."
3,tomato pretz,I Was very disapointed when received this product because it expires within one month! Company should not sale food like this by mail order. I don't mind pick up something in this situation in store. You know some people don't like to be troubled by send little things back and forth. So that's certainly took consumer's advantage. In the future would be really afraid to buy food products online.
2,Annoying,"This book annoyed the crap out of me. I read probably one romance title a week and this I acutally put aside until I finished another that I hoped would be more interesting. It starrted off OK but Cordelia was really immature and far too young for Leo. I understand women and young girls were married at an early age and expected to consumate these marriages - I guess it irritated me more that she 'fell in love' so quickly and Leo encouraged it. The spousal abuse was tastefully done - if that is possible due to subject matter, but I still didn't enjoy it and didn't particulary enjoy the 'happy ending' epilogue. I've tried a few of Jane Feather's book's and I think something is missing in most of them. The 'Bride' series was Ok but I have read alot better by other authors."
3,WAY TOO MUCH ABUSE!!!,"If I thought there was too much abuse in her book ""Beloved Enemy"" I was way off. This book has it way overboard. I will still try to read all the books on my waiting-to-be-read shelf but I can only hope she got SPOUSAL ABUSE out of her system. If not they will be traded for some light enjoyable reading. I bought this through [an] auction and really regret it. Sorry but I should probably stay with rereading Ms. Garwood or Jill Barnett."
4,Interesting,"Yes, the book itself is quite interesting in many places, and absolutely captivating in others. What is, to me, the most interesting is the need of some self-proclaimed atheists (i.e., the ""reader from California"") to trash Christian writings. They so often seem to have a compulsion to pick fights with those they deem inferior in intelligence to themselves. Apparently they just can't stand it when a true intellectual supports Christian and even (=gasp=) conservative viewpoints. How sad."
5,Great historical perspective,The information presented is accurate and thought provoking. I had never heard of Francis Schaeffer and was recommended this book by our church (PCA). It moves quickly through time periods.
1,How Should We Then Live,Thought that I wanted to read this after hearing Gloria Giather talk about it on the Giather show as it was the inspiration for one of their hit songs. Couldn't get into it. It was to textbook for me.
1,"Padded, clumsy and slow. Worst Saberhagen I've read.","__________________________________I made it through Saberhagen's new Berserker novel, but just barely-- the opening moves like rush-hour traffic in L.A.: S - L - O - W.Once it gets moving [around p. 160(!)] it's not too bad. Inside thepadding is a pretty decent novellette struggling to get out. Maybe. Thecharacters are so flat, cardboard looks well-rounded. Plot-threadsdangle, and logical holes gape. Saberhagen clearly lost interest at thefirst draft, and his editor didn't send it back for a badly-needed rewrite(bad Tor!). Is he in poor health?Shiva in Steel somehow got a good review in Locus, which is why Ibought it (besides having liked previous Berserker stories). So Isuppose YMMV, but I doubt it. Trust me -- you don't want to readthis one. Reread an old Berserker book instead. It's bad enough, I feelguilty recycling it to the used bookstore.Happy reading (something else) --Peter D. Tillman"
5,The Book to buy,"It is fantastic reading. Hard to put it down.And again, not a happy ending but that's the Warhammer Worldand our's - it is not meant to be happy."
2,Just OK,"Not a bad little phone but, the headphones it came with were useless (the input jack is where one of the earpieces should be and vice versa), this doesn't matter because the phone has no place to plug in earphones!!!! Also the slot for the memory card is too big for the card.. I would send it back but after waiting a month while it came from Hong Kong, I'll just deal with it and eventually buy something else"
2,Be Sure you are getting the right size paper,"I ordered this believing it to be 8 1/2 by 11. Not so, it is 17 by 11. Size is not clear on the listing. Have had wonderful luck using the Ilford Galerie paper when printing home photos."
4,The best compilation!,"Just so much fun and with so many different good games, hard not to have a good time!"
5,"COUNTERSTRIKE HITS HARD WITH ACTION, AND SUSPENSE!","DAVID HAGBERG, WHO ALSO WROTE UNDER THE NAME OF SEAN FLANNERY BEATS THE HECK OUT OF TOM CLANCY FOR ACTION, SUSPENSE, AND AN INSIDER'S KNOWLEDGE OF ESPIONAGE, AND THIS IS PROBABLY HIS BEST ACTION NOVEL.A SOCIOPATH HAS TAKEN ON THE JOB TO KILL GORBACHEV, AND WHEN HE IS ORDERED OFF THE HIT, HE STARTS KILLING THE PEOPLE WHO HIRED HIM, AND CONTINUES TO HUNT HIS QUARRY.THE ACTION IS SLAMBANG, THE SUSPENSE BUILDS IMMEASURABLY, KEEPING YOU HOOKED TO THE END OF ONE OF, IF NOT, HIS BEST BOOK EVER!OTHER GREAT FLANNERY BOOKS INCLUDEA. KILO OPTION(HIJACKING OF AN AMERICAN NUCLEAR SUBMARINE, TO BE USED FOR TERRORISM AGAINST THE U.S.A.)B. THE ZEBRA NETWORK(ABOUT CATCHING A TRAITOR AGAINST THE U.S., OR IS HE A TRAITOR?)C. BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT(WRITTEN UNDER HAGBERG'S OWN NAME) AB0UT PAKISTAN USING A NUC AGAINST INDIA, AND AMERICA'S INVOLVEMENT TO AVOID ALL OUT NUCLEAR WAR.EACH OF THESE BOOKS HAVE A RING OF TRUTH TO THEM, AND ARE VERY TIMELY, AND PROPHETIC."
3,"Not the best, but still has some ""oomph"" as a thriller.","Written at a time when the ""Gorbachev is a target"" plot was still a possibility, Counterstrike isn't Flannery's best work. It is, however, a nice thrill ride with some disturbing parts. The assassin Daniel Moran is somewhat demented, as he wants to carry out his plan just because he spent so much time on it. True he gets a little cartoonishly insane but overall Counterstrike is a good book. If you find a copy, get it and see."
1,POOR! Sounds like Kareoke...,I wish I never ordered this. It might be one person from the band but it sounds like Kareoke. I would not recommend this!!!
3,Light treatment for beginners,"This was the first book I bought for learning bookbinding. I liked the pretty color pictures and the way everything was kept simple. That is also the weakness of this book, as soon as you really decide to get serious there is insufficient information to do a professional job of any type of bookbinding and you end up going elsewhere for more information. But it accomplished my goal, and that is, it got me started in a wonderful hobby. And I still use the technique contained therein for making my own bookcloth and paste. Simple, easy, fun."
4,Enjoyable made-for-TV movie,"Not sure who said this would be available in a Special Edition DVD format...Most disappointed it ISN'T available here on the appointed date...However...12:01 was certainly entertaining, and while it didn't win any Emmys, it was a fun way to pass the time. Silverman and Slater are convincing in their respective roles of a bored office drone and a brilliant scientist caught in an experiment gone horribly wrong.(""And Jack STILL gets hit with the coffee!"")"
4,Good gift,good movie to watch...reminds one of groundhog day...but with a murder mystery plot line....
2,Poorly edited,"This book isn't poorly organized or written, it just hasn't had the rough edges smoothed out. It has some continuity problems in building the framework for the reader to place ideas into context, undefined terms, etc. Its not bad (and it is very basic), but there are probably better ones out there."
1,Lost the plot.,"A truly terrible book, that treats the reader like a moron.The blindingly obvious is explained over & over,& then againin case you still don't get it.The entire premise of this book could have been distilled in two pages.Don't bother ,play the music."
2,Not Nessary,please note: these are not required to listen to your mp3's if you're fine with just using the phone's own speaker
2,Annoying to read,"Covers all the topics, but in an academic and wordy fashion. not worth the money. he simply does not explain thing that well."
4,For me - not as good.,"The only problem with writing a superlative book, is that the following ones are, by definition, not as good. This is a great book - but - I loved 'Cloud Street', and had hoped for equal pleasure.'Cloud Street' is unique,classic; but, somehow, 'Dirt Music' kept reminding me of Keri Hulme's 'The Bone People'. Both authors write superbly of a loved land; strong flawed protagonists, and have a logic-defying ending, but...I won't return to 'Dirt Music' as I do to 'the Bone People', and to 'Cloud Street'."
3,Dirt Music Man,"Tim Winton is an Aussie through and through. I wouldn't give Dirt Music the same amount of credit as Cloudstreet, however, they are both wonderful novels. I thought that Dirt Music started to drag a little towards the end and started to have a ""Castaway"" feel to it when Luther Fox is hiding in the Gulf/ stranded on the island. That bit could have been cut in half and still maintained the story line. But overall I was pleased with this read and always enjoy Tim Winton's poetic writing style: ""She wondered what it might be like to live in his mind, in a world without forgiveness."""
2,"for ex-grade, these guys are pretty terrible.","kyle bishop was where all the talent was in the band, anyway. check out the swarm."
4,A fine album,"This is one of the more evocative records in my collection. Many of the tunes benefit from the lush string and harpsichord adornments that, some of the more pop'n'roll tracks aside, conjure a misty, medieval feel. I was a little curious as to the editorial comment from Roy Francis Kasten with reference to the Pennebaker film 'Don't Look Back'. For a kickoff, it was Donovan who requested that Dylan play 'It's All Over Now, Baby Blue' as opposed to it being a pointed 'put down' on Dylan's behalf. As for the metaphorical disappearing into the wallpaper, maybe that was part of the DVD special features 'cos I don't recall it."
3,Help Please,If any one can tell me how to get across the waterfall in the underground cavern in the inverted castle to get to the room with the Osafune Sword please Email me Back with the answer!!! I would very much Appreciate it...Thanks Alot!!!!
5,This CD is for Mostly Monsters...,Great out of print CD! Tracks are:1. MOSTLY MONSTERS 2. DARK ANGEL 3. FADE RESISTANT 4. WAITING 5. FAVORITE SONG 6. TOO FAST 7. UNTIL THAT DAY 8. THE LIFT 9. SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL 10. RIDE 11. ROAD TO YOU.
1,Make your own.,"These cards may work great if you're using Mounce's book. But I'm not. I'm using Hewett's and I thought it would be nice, rather than scribbling my own cards, to have some that are nicely printed. The problem is that these 1000 words are not organized alphabetically. So it's difficult to find the vocabulary words I need for Hewett's text. In fact, it's not even worth the effort of either resorting the 1000 cards, which are organized based on frequency of usage in the New Testament! If you was to learn your vocabulary just based on how many times a word appears these cards are for you. But if you want to use them to supplement any text other than Mounce's . . . not so much."
4,young chrome,"whats up music fans yo check out this fool chrome the boi is too hard st8 from north memphis ....the album is real good the beats are reuse, some of them but the lryics and guests are st8...paul and juciy did st8 with chrome.....mane this is the hardest album that came out from them folk this year.....and to the dude who said that that frasyer boy is hard mane it was ok .....it wasnt all of that tho........before i go new chrome fans need to the that shank and chrome album daily living....its a memphis classic (it true chrome not new just to the pros)"
5,Chrome goes STRAIGHT TO THE PROS,"Excellent album produced by Three 6 Mafia. Chrome may not be a pro but with the help of DJ Paul and HCP he is able to bring heat on his debut album. The beats are the usual crunk 36 down south type and the album carrys well in all categories. Make sure you buy this cd along with the new Frayser Boy cd ""ME BEING ME"" which is the best 36 produced album of the year."
2,k,some songs are bangin like take em to church and crunck musik but Santana that song ruins the cd thet got skills all of em but they could have done better
4,Very nice to look at..,"This book is an awesome book and the men are absolutely beautiful,but I expected a little more thats why I didn't give it a full five stars, But the black and white make it very exotic..."
3,Good Product - but not perfect.,"This is about the best product that I have tried to cut down on yellow spots that are caused by your dog, but does not eliminate them completely. We still get yellow spots occasionally, but the product does help. For a 50lb dog we have to use 9 small squirts to be effective, rather then the 3 they recommend. We have not experienced any health issues from the use of this product, and continue to use it."
1,Don't buy if you have snow Leopard,"I have Snow Leopard, I can not get this game to work period. I've been on the forums & re-written files as recommend, & downloaded stuff without success."
2,Out! Pet Stain & Odor Remover...,"Has a pleasant smell, but doesn't do that well removing existing odor. I will try a different product next time."
5,I love this bikini trimmer!!!,"I absolutely love this trimmer!!!I read a review on Amazon about this product, which rated it very poorly. Despite that, I decided to give it a try. I had one of those $10 micro trimmers, but it was not doing a good job and I needed a new one.Trusting Epilady to make a good product, I bought the Lady B. It has been doing a great job for me, and for the price, it must be the best trimmer out there. My friend had another large trimmer, but the epilady one is much more delicate, and I have never suffered from rashes or razor burns like I used to with other trimmers. This one is quiet and fast, and I am so ready for the warm weather now!I would recommend it."
1,Jones has to be kidding - NO stars!,"CONTRACEPTION is to blame???? PUH-leese!Jones seems to think there's a nefarious plot of some kind against Catholics by Protestants - a plot that Catholics can thwart by having more kids.In what century is HE living?Someone should tell him to read John T. McGreevy's ""Parish Boundaries"" ."
4,Must have for new and intermediate photographers.,"This is a very good book on lighting and posing. It covers a lot of lighting setups complete with drawings. IT discusses different lighting effects and shows you examples. Overall, I am very pleased with this book. Highly recommend for the home studio folks."
3,Very informing,If you are looking for a book that has various types of lighting then this is okay. It has great information but 90% of the lighting illustrations are using softboxes and I have umbrellas. Nevertheless it is still a good book.
5,Ahead of his time......again?,"This DVD is of a great gig by Hancock and this band. The line-up of somewhat lesser known musicians (currently) is actually a great showcase of these up and coming talents. Hancock shows he is the master of the past, present and the future. I would love to see more of this kind of thing."
1,What's it all about?,"Being a big fan of jazz and Herbie I looked forward to my first viewing of future2future. However I was unpleasantly surprised. I agree with what's already been said that the DJ was entirely unnecessary. He persisted with irritating hues and shrieks that only took away from the music. It was like watching the twilight zone while listening to a jazz solo. Furthermore Herbie's little speeches only inspired impatience: ""Knowledge is the future""- ok man thanks for that. I appreciate the search for a new sound etc but not when its dragging good musicians behind the cart. If you like ""weird"", this might be for you but it wasnt for me. If you want to hear/see Herbie on a great set check out Dejohnette, Hancock, Holland, Metheny in concert live at the mellon jazz festival. Or listen to Directions in Music one of Herbie's more recent collaborations."
5,Disney Memories.,"I bought this book both for myself, and for my daughter as a gift in 2006. Though I've never been to Disneyworld, I grew up in Southern California in the land of Disney (both my brother and sister worked there).I LOVE this cookbook! The first recipe I tried was the Chicken Pot Pie. I'd been looking for a decent pot pie recipe for ages and this one definitely does it. The beef and barley soup is delicious and easy to make. I've tried recipes from various sections and have never been disappointed.I'd definitely pick this up for a shower or housewarming gift. Anyone who cooks, or is just learning would benefit greatly from this cookbook. One of my favorites, and I have over 200 cookbooks."
2,"Bad, bad, bad...","The only thing worth watching in this mess is Natasha Henstridge (that's why it has rating of 2 stars, otherwise it would get -5 stars). Everything else that makes a movie worth watching (story, acting etc...) is so awfully bad it defies belief. Of course, special effects are OK, but that doesn't change the fact that is a bad, bad, bad movie..."
2,Pass On This One!,"This movie is a real stinker. If you want eye candy and that is all you want, then Natasha Henstridge certainly fills that void. If you want an intelligent, coherent movie with interesting characters then you are out of luck! Forest Whitaker is probably the most annoying in this movie because he is an ""empath"" whose main role seems to be stating the glaringly obvious in every situation. Ben Kingsley comes in a close second with a thoroughly unlikeable character. There are plenty of plot holes and just plain ole stupidity all through this film. I will not be checking out the sequels to this lame sci-fi/horror hybrid."
3,Part one is just as cool as part two,"When I told my mothers friend I liked this movie, my mother jumped into the conversation, and said ""You just like that movie, because of that nudity."" She was right, and I am a fan of Michelle Williams, and I like monster movies."
1,How bad,"I don't know how to begin my comments, the movie is so bad, the alien looks is a mix of Alien and human, Natasha Henstridge is always one step ahead the group, they always go together every where and... Uh. What's Ben Kingsley doing in this film? Does anybody remember him in Ghandi? The only good thing of the film is Natasha Henstridge."
1,Awful,"This film made me feel sick, it is gory with a storyline that just didn't hold my attention at all.Not my cup of tea at all."
2,Just a Grade 'B' Skin Flick,Not much on story but a number of good looks at a new comer in the altogether.Interesting to see a CSI star at such an early stage of her acting career.
3,Ok Science Fiction,"That the plot was interesting but not fully developed, Loved the basic premise that the science fiction was based on but then they went on a ""mating"" bonanza. A couple interesting characters for the plot but seemed to get side tracked after the first 30 minutes."
2,Boring,Not as exciting as it was in High School. Couldn't even bring myself to finish it. There are better free movies in the sci fi/horror genre out there.
3,good movie,I've only seen this movie on broadcast TV. There are several parts wich shouldn't be on TV. The movie is much better when you can see all of it.
3,The Fly Fishing Corpse,"I'm glad I purchased this book because it was David Leitz' first publication. But as I started to read it, I realized the plot was very familiar. This was actually the same book as his second in the series with Dead Letter Mysteries. It does however make a very welcome addition to my collection because it is a signed copy from the author. Thanks Amazon for your efficient delivery of my very special book."
1,Not so good,"The movie is really laim , the only good thing about it is the soft porn in it , I mean i dont like porn but these girls are really hot in this movie . But i recomend it for a collection of scary movie s but if you do get it ge it and watch it with your drunk friends,"
1,STUPID!!!!!!!!,bleed sucked BIG time the movie is so stupid heres a shot little summary about it a girl meets a guy they have sex and he shows her to his friends they are drunk and they tell her they are in a murder club if you want to be in the club you have to kill someone how lame!! they were just joking but she takes it for real and kills someone and one of her frinds kills the whole cast and kidnaps her in the end its stupid!! the blood and kills loook so fake and the camera is crap when you are watching it the color and everything is crappy you can tell this movie took like 50 bucks to make dont see this movie you will be unhappy if you do ITS JUNK
3,I thought it would be better.,"Although the concept is great, the game play isn't as fun as I thought it would be. The graphics aren't too great and the movement isn't very good either. The camera bucked too much a couple times while I was trying to center in on my target. It's alright though. I wish they'd improve more on the game. Like I said great concept. Could have been better."
5,WOW,"I get the most freeing and intense feeling when I listen to Nikka. She has got something that's all hers alone. She's a mixuture of Teena Marie, Aretha, and Tina all rolled into one and then some. She has one undying fan in me!!! I'm telling everyone I know who will listen, to COP THIS ALBUM.NIKKA IS MUSIC!!!!!!"
4,Funky Diva,"This is a great album to dance to. Nikka Costa and her crew put together some of the funkiest beats and meshed with good lyrics, it gives off an irresistable groove on every song, even the slow ones. There is a wide variety of songs here. I'd say my favorites are 'So Have I For You' (a slow smooth groove and I love the lyrics) and 'Everybody Got Their Something' which has a cool stacatto beat. There could be improvements here (the ablum sort of lags halfway through) but she is on her way. Can't wait to see her next offering."
3,Everybodys got to listen to this Cd!,"I wonder if Frank Sinatra ever knew his god daughter would be a soul diva? I listened to this album for about 15 minutes before I found my self tracking back to the first song ""Like A Feather"". This song which is the first release really gives the entire album a push that it really needs. Some of the other songs on the Cd could be a little better if the producers would have attempted to mix it somewhat. It seems to disconnect from the flow of the album around the fifth or sixth track. Over all your looking at a few gems here that keep the album consistant. ""Like a Feather"", ""Everybody Got Their Something"" and ""Push & Pull"" seem to keep the seams together for this album. Overall after a few listenings you'll realize you've got something!"
3,colorful,"i think this is an educational toy but my baby didn't like to play with it, he's 1 yr old, he seems scared of the pictures. i liked it because of it being colorful, but when my baby steps on it, he ignores it. also, the placing of some of the pictures and the buttons are not aligned."
3,They editted out the best parts!,"This DVD features some of the most gorgeous magazine models... Veronica Zemanova, Victoria Zdrok, Aria Giovanni and a whole bevy of beauties. Unfortunately one area of their anatomy was conspicuously editted out... which is a shame with all the premium pink that this DVD could have featured. Any time a model is about to open her legs there is an abrupt edit, making this a disappointing DVD, simply because it could have been an awesome one without the censorship."
4,Good little PA system,"Works well. Projects very well for being such a little system. Used it outdoors with a group of about 200 people, and it worked great. Only problem - you can't go more than about thirty or forty feet from the unit with the portable mic."
4,Rewritten review of the PYLE PWMA100,"A week or so ago, I wrote a somewhat negative review of this product. The compartment door for the power cord had a tad bit of glue on it where at first I couldn't get it open. Goo Begone w/Cotton a swab took care of that issue. Works fine now and it was a production flaw over across the big pond and the blame for this should go there.The instruction booklet should be alittle clearer but that's how it is when things become a bit foggy when the stuff comes from overseas.Except for these minor things, the unit works real well and the quality is just as I expected. I give it 4 stars out of 5"
2,glad I didn't buy the hardback,"I can't believe that this book has so many readers ""enthralled"" and up all night. I really didn't like this book and reading it was a chore. If you want to read a really good thriller check out ""Messiah"" by Boris Starling. Now that's a good read!"
2,Not worth even $1.00,"This book is just plain bad. Anatomical errors abound, which is unforgivable since the main character is a NEUROLIGIST! I tried to read this book four times. The farthest I got was page 152. There are many reasons I could not read the entire 482 book. Too many to list actually. Here's one-The main character is supposed to be a very brilliant doctor. But this so called genius does not even put in place the most rudimentery home safety featrues: which you would think she would do after Toyer contacts her. Also, where in the world are the police? Apparently in another book. I gave it two stars only because the idea of the book was a good one. But it was not written in a way to garner a higher rating. And the grammar of the book is worse than mine. Don't even touch this book."
1,"Read Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" instead!","What a piece of trash this book was! If you're looking for a serial-killer story with a completely unbelieveable storyline, the world's most inept detectives, and a ""killer"" who (with no medical background) is able to perform complex medical proceedures, then ""Toyer"" is for you. By the end of the book I didn't care if Toyer was caught or not. This book is so jam-packed with unpleasant characters (all of whom sleep with each other at some point) that I was hoping they would all get bumped off by the end. Thank God I only bought it in paperback. This book was so unrealistic that it was laughable, and certainly not frightening. Read Red Dragon instead, which has similar themes and was ten times the book."
1,"Please, don't mess with the classics!","Ouch! It really hurts when consumers are mislead, as in this case. Those of us who respect the classics know that cd analog leaves much to be desired but don't tread on the content UNLESS you clearly indicate that the material in newly recorded and especially when the lead singer (who was the heart of their sound) isn't even performing. Repackage this release or suffer the backlash. Please, don't tread on the classics! Triple R Rock Radio - Wild Bill Gill standing in for Harvey Warfield & The Revival of His Mighty Rock N' Roll Air Force (circa 60's/70's)"
5,Remembering,"I Love this movie,the kindness shown to her by the white soldier was very special.the care and love she gave the young boy and raised him as her son was very heartfelt,I just wish they had showed those years of them growing up.Miss Jane reminds me so much of my grandmother (MAMA)who raised me and my three older sister's from birth,being born in Miss.back in the early 50's and 60's if you were'nt married and you have children out of wedlock your kin had to raise them,for most of my young life as far as I knew she was my mother til I was fixing to graduate from 8th grade did I find out that she was my grandmother mother of my mother,but it really did'nt matter.she was and is my Heart,that's what this movie reminds me of,our relationship we had a very close bond and always will,that's why this movie is so special to me. REMEMBERING MAMA"
5,Cicely Tyson is Great,Cicely Tyson acted her behind off in this movie. You would never guess that this was not a real character because it chronicled so many things that occurred throughout history.
3,IT' S NOT THE SAME,"With the minor exception of Epicus Doomicus. Messiah Marcolm and the heavy riffs made Candlemass one of my favorite doom metal bands next to Black Sabbath. This release unfortunately did nothing for me. Once into the first couple of songs there was hope and promise, but I then became bored when it all started sounding the same. Although Tomas Vikstroms voice was fine, the music seemed to loose it's heavy doom like sound. Unlike the first four releases there was nothing I could point my finger to and say WOW what a great song. This CD is not terrible, just different. If you have everything else by them, by all means, try it! If you are new to Candlemass try: Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, Tales of Creation and Nightfall instead."
3,Not up to par with the show it was filmed at. I know.,"I love Jimmy Eat World with a passion. These guys are incredible. I waited for this video for several months, even though i knew it was just an EP preview to the full video. I have to say that I was pretty dissappointed. I was at the show that they filmed the DVD at, and it was the best Jimmy show I have ever seen (out of 6). But this video makes it look like the show blew. They only show one performance, and im proud to say you can see me in the crowd, but the problem is that the sound .... There is not enough bass, which leaves you with only the sound of Toms guitar and distorts the song.I would wait for the full length video to come out and pass this one up. And keep in mind if you do get this, that Jimmy Eat World sounds MUCH better live than they seem in this video."
3,OK,"Good article, but doesn't look like in the pictures, is absolutely original but so old and some pages are really damaged... however, was sent it just on time... Thanks...!"
2,Not Good At All,I have to agree with some reviewrs as well as be honest. For such a real issue that could happen this book was not a good representation of what it could have been. I gave the author one star for having the courage to write this storyline and one star for writing certain scenes that made me believe I was in that state. But I mean come on Tracey was a monster for doing what she was doing to her child and thinking it was okay. Then to have such a well adjsuted child as Lauren it made you wonder who was the adult. To make matters worse the author leads you to believe Tracey was pregnant by Aaron but that storyline never goes anywhere. All I can say is it was a good try for this author but I would not recommend anybody to buy this book. Buy a Hoagie instead.
2,My Daughter's Boyfriend,"This book was not very interesting. I couldn't identify with any of the characters, and only completed reading it because it was the monthly choice for our book club. I did, however, like the format of the story being told by three different characters."
4,Decent Read,This is a good read. The book is a little slow but picks up. This book shows how a man can come in and corrupt the daily tasks of the even the most strong woman! It explores the path of a mother and daughter relationship from the top to bottom and then back to the top!
2,Great Idea for a Book......BUT,"I was ready to really get into some serious character development with this one, but I was sadly mistaken. Yes the sex scene between the 30 something woman and 20 something man lived up to what you would expect. But nobody's character was well-defined enough to make me understand the whys behind the relationship. I didn't LIKE any particular character in this book. And at one point I was actually just wishing that the daughter would hurry up and find out so we could move on from the ""made-up"" drama. I thought this was a great idea for a book, but the dialogue, lack of character development and lack of a male/female relationship that you could actually root for just made me quickly read this book and put it in my ""never to be touched again"" category."
1,Be Warned!!,"Anyone who is considering buying this book should be aware that when Charles Givens died, he and his organization were being sued by many people and were under investigation or had had legal action taken against them by a number of states. This includes Florida, where his headquarters was located. Many of his methods have been been shown to be far riskier than he claimed, and the legality of others has been questioned.Another fact that should be pointed out is that his organization, which sold financial advice, frequently did not follow Mr. Givens methods, particularly for mutual fund selection."
2,Disappointed!,"Franklin Classic Series 107mm. Bocce SetThe bocce set was what I had expected but the shipping and follow up was disappointing. The bocce set was shipped in the display box, clearly not strong enough for the heavy bocce set, so when it arrived the box was ripped and torn up. I had contacted the company but they were no help only stating that they often ship in the display box. I won't puchase through them again or use Amazon."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to receive this product at first. When it arrived, I opened it and the perfume AND the lotion didn't smell like it's supposed to..almost as if it has been sitting on a shelf for years. Very disappointed, especially since I paid $80 for this!"
4,"Overrated, a meddler","Churchill,like Hitler,was a military amateur trying to play a professional's game. He need not have lost North Africa at all. Montgomery was a third-rate general,and won his battles only on account of overwhelming force.The myth of the two ought to be debunked. Neither were any good. I think that Sir Miles Dempsey would have been the best commander of the British forces. I also think that Sir Henry Crerar, of the Canadian army, was mediocre at best.If Eisenhower had replaced Montgomery, as he badly wanted to do, and if the Allies had invaded in 1943 instead of 1944, the war would have drawn to a much quicker resolution. Marshall knew this, but allowed himself to be overruled. That was the greatest tragedy of the war in Europe."
5,A MUST READ for women who are trying to conceive,"I bought this book after trying to conceive for four months. I had been using ovulation predictor kits and taken the advice of my OB/GYN and nothing seemed to work. However, after charting my cycle and employing the recommendations from the book, I got pregnant within 2 months. I am now a proud parent of a 3-month old baby boy."
5,This is a book they should hand out to girls in high school,"Not only is this book great for getting pregnant and monitoring yourself while pregnant, it is great for learning about your body. This is information women should all be privy to. Many doctors are not even familiar with this information.Anyone who is thinking of trying to conceive, who has been ttc unsuccessfully or just wants to know more about their own bodies should get this book.This book was worth every single penny spent on it. To me, it is worth (more)!"
5,I got pregnant on the very first cycle!,using this book. It is amazing and I recommend it to everyone I know. I charted for just one month and got pregnant that same month! This book was a revelation.
2,Not worth it,"Who has time (other than stay at home women) to examine charts on a daily basis? While this book provides some useful information, all it really shows a woman is how to tell when she is ovulating. There is a much easier solution - buy an ovulation predictor kit! The kits are easier to use and do not require a woman to write everything down on a chart. Also, this book has NO information about things that could impair fertility (such as environmental factors, smoking, foods, etc.). I would recommend Marilyn Glenville's ""Boost Your Fertility"" instead of this book."
1,"for practical advice, put your money somewhere else","If you need to figure out your most likely to conceive time, visit a local pharmacy store and buy an Ovulation Predictor kit. You can spend a year charting your temperature with no results. The kits are far less invasive, much friendlier, and most importantly, far more accurate in providing you the information you need. For me, this book was a waste of money and a lot of time..."
5,Very Informative,"I encourage any fertile woman or young girl approaching puberty to read this book, whether looking to get pregnant or not."
5,Amazing wealth of information,"This book is fantastic! I had no idea how little I knew about my own fertility until reading this. My husband and I have been using the Fertility Awareness Method in this book as birth control for almost a year and it works! I was doubtful at first, but I can tell you it's legitimate. A wonderful way for women to learn their bodies and also get free from hormonal birth control. It is also FULL of useful information about women's bodies/conditions/etc. A great reference book that every woman should own."
5,my miricle maker,Due to irregular ovulation and infrequent periods i assumed i was infertile. After charting i realized i was in fact ovulating just late. My doctor put me on clomid to help me ovulate more often and i got pregnant the first month. It's nice to know my exact date of conception and how exactly the female body works. This should be the text book for high school sex ed.
5,Amazing book,"I ordered this book based on the number of positive reviews but had little hope it would help me. My husband and I had been trying for 2 years and I thought I ""knew"" how to get pregnant. Well, WAS I WRONG! I read this book in 3 days and it truly helps you understand your body better. We had been doing it ""wrong"" all along. My next cycle I got pregnant and I am happy to say we are expecting our first child in April!!!! I have told numerous other women about this book in hopes it will help them as it has helped us. :)"
4,It is very good!,"I think the book is good, but the first two chapters are pretty unnecessary. I also like the cd-rom that comes with it but that is only a 15 day free trial."
5,AMAZING!,"I consider myself to be an educated woman and I thought I had a pretty good idea of what happens in my body. When my husband and I decided to start trying for a baby, I thought it would be easy since we were both young and healthy. After several months of trying and no succes, I started asking friends for help. One friend recomended this book and it is AMAZING! I discovered so many things about my body that I did not know. After 3 months of charting, we are now pregnant! I know this book was the reason we were able to get pregnant so quickly. I will certainly tell all of my friends who are trying to get pregnant to read this book FIRST!"
5,No woman should be without this book!,"I can't believe how much I didn't know about my own body. This book is written in layman's terms, so is easy to understand... but don't think of it as fluff, it's highly informative. I have so much more respect about my body now that I understand how it works!"
5,One of the best uses of your time and money ... ever,"I adore this book! I learned so much from it! I cannot believe I made it to age 26 before learning how awesome my body is. This will be helpful if you're trying to conceive, trying to prevent, or just want to learn more about your own body with the goal of loving it more and taking care of it better. BUY IT. READ IT. Seriously."
5,a NFP user,"Great book, wonderful guide to using natural forms of birth control as well as for those who are ttc.My only problems with the book were that she has a feminist slant and her section on nutrition was basically a referral to ""Fertility, Cycles, and Nutrition"". She also does not discuss what you can do to prevent infertility in the first place (having children younger, avoiding chemical birth control, etc...)Otherwise, an excellent book. Those not familiar with checking their mucus sign will greatly appreciate the pictures. I would buy this one and The Art of Natural Family Planning, because the two compliment each other nicely."
5,It worked!,"I bought this book (along with some others) in a fit of ""baby fever"" in January. I wanted to learn more before my husband and I committed to trying to get pregnant.This book demystifies everything about reproductive anatomy and how the female cycle actually works. I began charting my waking body temperatures in January to understand my cycle.Because of the temp. charting as described in the book, I know the exact day on which I conceived. Also, had I NOT been charting my temperatures I would not have known I was pregnant so quickly since I had what appeared to be a normal cycle.This is a great book, very informative with lots of examples and even a little humor now and then."
5,Wonderful Option for Natural Birth Control,I love this book! I only wish my husband would be more open to the idea of natural birth control :( I have recommended this book to my sister who is now 23 weeks pregnant :) Thanks Toni for making this a great option for those of us who want to be more healthy!
5,Worth every penny and more,"My doctor recommended this book. I recommend it to anyone trying to get pregnant or to have a holistic approach to birth control. Have never been in better tune with my body and sparks the old saying that holds true, it's all in the timing. This book is a valuable resource to any woman."
5,Eye Opening Experience,"I was amazed by the details put into this book. I learned so much about female body and I don't feel uneducated when I go see my OBGYN. I can't believe I just go visit OBGYN not knowing what is really happening inside own body. After I get yearly for some years, I still didn't know what I was. Now, I know my all life went without real education about uniqueness of my own body. I am in late 30's. This book is great reference to any woman. I wish it was in a college course or even high school class. It will be the best class you ever take! I am happy I found this book. This knowledge is a POWER."
5,Awesome,This book is great. It will answer all of your questions...even the weird ones. :) I suggest this book to all women...trying to conceive or not becuase it really helps you to understand your body.
5,Awesome book.,"Great book, I have never had fertility problems, but I did buy and read this before conceiving my second child and we conceived the first time we tried. I am now very aware of my cycle and when I am ovulating."
3,good,I see this book has assisted my spouse and I to learn about our curiosities in fertility. We are better off now having learned about the ways to best use fertility cycles.
3,Only keeps cold for about 15-20 minutes.,This product is very nice only if you need short term icing. It takes too long for it to freeze back up. I would recommend you buy a different ice compress.
1,elvis at the hayride,mostly a narrative cd with very little music--not what I thought it would be what a waste of time and money
5,hope theres more to come,"I saw this and it gave me hope, that more seasons would come out. I could care less,if the realese the 80's,because those were slightly worse than mad tv. But, I hope they put the Farley years on dvd"
4,if you loved sat nite....get this version,darn gooddont eat or drink while watchingunless u wanna choke when belushi comes up !have some real funif you know what we mean eh
5,SNL Forever,"I love Saturday Night Live and I am proud to finally have the complete seasons of the first five years of the show; I guess I could say they were the best 5 years of the show even though there are so many magically hilarious highlights in the following years even to this day. Between the hosts, musical guests, original skits, satirical commercials and Mr. Bill, I am so happy to have these 5 complete seasons in my hands to watch anytime."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"This movie deserves zero stars. It is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your precious hours on earth watching this poorly written, acted, shot, and edited feature. I've seen a lot of low, no-budget movies before; I've even worked on some, and this one getting all the recognition that it has gotten just astounds me. As every movie I choose to view they are given 20 minutes to grab me with something, be it the plot, the cinematography or other. There is simply nothing good to say about it. Get your thumb ready if you rent this one because it will work overtime on the fast forward button."
2,Nothing spectacular,"All I have to say about this album is ????? It really lacks the spice and flavor of Sonora Ponce√±as previous hits. All it has going in this album is ""Fuego en el 23"" and the last track which is a medley of their biggest hits that includes Fuego en el 23 AGAIN!!!! I know it is a medley, but the decision to include the SAME song in an album was not a wise one. The rest is just average or just plain mediocre music. This album is one of the reasons I am not a huge Sonora Poncena fan."
4,I know it's a cliche but...,"I know it's a cliche but...THIS WOMAN COULD SING THE PHONE BOOK! I remember her from when I was a child. of course, I wasn't allowed to listen to most of her stuff, but when I could sneak and listen, I did. I forgot how much I loved her and didn't realize what a SOUL singer she was--made those tired country and pop songs into something even a purist could listen to because on her tongue, they were almost unrecognizable. Sit up and take notice youngsters, this is what SINGING is. the girls we like now listen to people like Ms. Jackson here. Bold and bawdy for sure, using some words I wish she wouldn't, but telling it like it is. dirty comedy, true life situations you hope your daughter isn't in, and some BAD ASS SANGIN'! I bet she never dropped a note in her life."
3,Pretty Good,"I think this book is an excellent starter for anyone who hasn't studied much about the bible or biblical people. However, if you've read more in-depth books on this subject (for example ""Reading Women in the Bible"" by Tikva Frymer-Kensky) this one isn't going to tell you anything new."
2,Parents beware,Preview this CD before you let your teens and younger listen. You'll have a lot of explaining to to otherwise.
5,the real Janet,"This album epitomizes Janet's ability to tap into her own personal source of inspiration and bring forth music that touches the hearts of all. There is something for everyone, slow, fast, party, sexual, thoughtful, but it's all real!"
2,this CD is very....suprising and dissappointing,"I just recieved this CD a few days ago. I was increadably excited and couldn't wait for it to come. I listened to it and soon looked at the book. I was suprised greatly because of the terrible and discusting lyrics. My perception of Janet now is totally different from how it's been for a few years-a really good music artist. Now I'm not sure I'll buy another one of her CD's. There are only 3 songs I actually like-All for you, Someone to call my lover, and When we OOooooo. The rest to me are not worth listening-I don't want to hear the words she sings, I personaly think the cover should have some kind of note on it explaining this topic. [....] To the customer:Buy the single, don't waste your money on the whole CD."
1,A Waste of Money,"Except for the title tune (for which the mix on this album is much inferior to the video), it's a collection of the worst of Janet. Lots of those pointless interludes and ballads with no melody or hook. Avoid it. I have several of her older CDs. She just seems to get worse with time."
3,CD Does Not Live Up To Expectations of Previous Ones!,"Sorry to say this, but I was kind of disappointed in this cd. The only good songs on here are the ones they released on the radio like ""all for you"", the title cd, and the ""son of a gun"" one. Other than that, I don't think it is all that. Here last two cds were much better, ""Janet"" and ""Velvet Rope"", where there were so more songs to enjoy. I am only giving this a 3 because it Janet Jackson and she's still a talented artist, and I really don't want to give it a low score like 2 or 1. But, seriously, all she does a little too often is moan and groan like someone said. Not trying to mimick them, but they do have a point, indeed. And now that I think about it, she probably does that to make up for her lack of a strong voice, though the soft, whispery one is alright. She writes a lot of her own music so I have to give her credit for that.Hope she comes back good."
2,Below average,"Like the other reviewers, I love Janet Jackson & have cherished her past albums. Having heard (& immediately liked) the songs ""All for you"" and ""Someone to Call My Lover,"" I had concluded that the rest of the songs must be just as good and immediately purchased the CD.Boy was I wrong. Amazingly enough (and just my luck), every song other than those two just mentioned were just plain bad. The melodies, the music, the rhythm were awkward and very difficult to listen to with any appreciation.Again, I am a Janet Jackson fan, and for a performer like her, this album is below par."
2,What is she saying?,"I have been a long time Janet fan. I have always enjoyed her music, until now. I mean, I like the music somewhat but with each album she puts out she get more and more whiney. I mean can anybody hear what she is saying?"
1,I'm not impressed,"Being that the first single, ""All For You"" is knockin', I thought that there would be more quality songs on this disk. True, indeed some of the songs are playful, but to who was this disk catering to?I have been a fan of Janet for years, and I have to say that this effort is disappointing. Yes, Janet is a GROWN woman in her thirties, but at the same time, wouldn't you think she's past the whole 'trying too hard to be overly sexy' stage? Janet is a beautiful woman, and does not need to market, promote or distribute music with overly explicit lyrics. She's a good performer, but this CD isn't a representation of that.You can buy it to complete your Janet collection, but I wasn't moved by it. And that's just my honest opinion."
4,Great pop Fun Erotic Album,"Janet is funky, Fresh and sexy on this record, The titled Single topped the Charts for 5 weeks. This album also solified her as a Legend. She was slaying all the lessers. Go Janet!"
2,"Actual title should be ""The Day That Harris & Lewis Got The Flu""","Even though I've stated that Janet Jackson is my favorite singer, I've become disgusted with the mediocrity of her more recent output after having my subconscious indelibly stamped with the greatness of her late 80s/early 90s albums. None of her albums are completely disposable, but there's not a lot to recommend this one, either. ""Doesn't Really Matter"" and ""Come On Get Up"" are plausible efforts, but the rest is pretty tepid, especially the embarrassingly bad ""Someone To Call My Lover"" which is a good way to make pop purists angry with its blatant rip-off of the America classic ""Ventura Highway""."
3,mmmmm....notsogood,"I usually love Janet's music but this cd is kind of poor. She never seems to be saying anything at all. She sort of comes across as a wannabe Britney Spears which obviously makes no sense. Yes, I do find some good things in some of the songs, and do occasionally listen to the cd, but... I was really looking forward to this cd and there is nothing nothing nothing on here to make you think and nothing nothing nothing that sounds so great you have to hear it over and over again. That pisses me off. This cd is about the zenith of vapidity! Janet, what happened girl???? lol ok sorry but while there are some good or potentially really good songs here like 'when we ooo' and 'trust a try' and a few others, there is nothing to really sink your teeth into. Seems like this was a work in progress and nobody ever really figured out just how to make this album work. What I want to know is what happened to the Neptunes tracks... and hey how come WE don't get a bonus track???"
1,A crime against japan,I could be janet jackson. I can dance like a drunk prostitute and write new lyrics to J-pop songs.I am deeply insulted. This album is a MORTAL SIN against all that I hold dear. I will hold this against ALL american Pop singers FOREVER.Don't believe me about the j-pop thing?Check out the song (and album) Papillion by Shimatani Hitomi
4,not bad(3.5 stars),"I'm a huge janet jackson fan but this album seemed disappointing to me for the longest time because her music sounded far from fresh and innovative like her previous albums, but now I listen to this, compare to damita jo and I actually like this album a lot now, and it seems to have more of that jackson sound than damita jo which sounds nothing like a janet jackson album with the exception of a few tracks. Her voice is much better on this CD than on damita jo too, happy, strong and confidence shines in her pretty voice and puts me in a great mood. It gives me the same kind of vibes something fresh and upbeat with a timeless sound does, just like michael jackson's off the wall or music from that time period. Definitely buy if you like catchy dance music and janet jackson, even if it's not as innovative as her previous efforts, it's still a nice CD."
2,Janet hits a dead end on here!,"This album was a major dissapointment on so many levels. After such a great CD like ""The Velvet Rope"", AFY looking at it now, marked the beginning of the end for Janet's music.Many of these songs are just plain drab and are forgettable. The exceptions are the title track which is really a fun dance song, ""Trust A Try"" and ""Truth"" and the closing track ""Better Days"". The rest of this album doesn't fare well though.The middle part of this album is just awful and feels more like spoken softcore material than a music CD! ""Would You Mind"" is just plain stupid, even by teen pop standards. The interludes also are completely messy as well.As bad as it is, this album almost sounds like a gem compared to it's horrible follow up ""Damita Jo"".Looking at it now, I hate to say it but this album marked Janet's decline into blandness that has hit rock bottom with it's following disaster ""Damita Jo"". Stick with your older Janet albums."
4,I didn't realize that the person in the purple dinosaur suit,"was none other than Janet Jackson. If that is the case, then yes, this album is quite vulgar. All attempts at humor aside, I seriously doubt that this album was written with children in mind. In case people don't realize, people grow and change. Of course Janet's new albums are nothing like her first albums when she was pretty much a kid. She is now a grown woman talking about grown up topics using grown up language. Get over it. The Janet that you knew (or thought you knew) has matured into a wonderful woman who is not afraid to express her sexuality and anger. I think she expresses both well on this album. I certainly don't like this album as much as I like her others, but there are some good tracks. My personal faves are 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 18, and 19. The others range from mediocre to really bad, but all in all, a decent album."
4,still funky,"IF I HAD READ THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS ON THIS PAGE FIRST, I MAY HAVE NEVER BOUGHT YHE C.D. ! ALL FOR YOU IS A SOLID EFFORT BY A TRUE PROFESSIONAL. J.J. HAS A SERIOUS BODY OF WORK TO LIVE UP TO BUT YOU MUST BE REALISTIC. EVEN JORDAN DIDN'T HIT 40 PTS. EVERY NIGHT. THE ALBUM IS UPBEAT AND FUN TO DRIVE TO. THE CARLY SIMON DUO WAS A NICE SURPRISE AND VERY FUNKY. HEY, LIGHTEN UP! THE ""ADULT"" LANGUAGE IS MINIMAL AND JANET HAS NEVER PORTRAYED HERSELF AS MARY POPPINS ANYWAY! TRUE FANS SHOULD GET WIT' DIS ONE"
2,all for you,"Hey guys, I bought the new Janet album in hopes for anotherVelvet Rope(MY FAVORITE CD) but i just got [bad stuff]. I appreciate the effort J. but this dont say CLASSIC JANET. its short of your family quailty!!!Nice try!!"
3,okay effort from miss janet,"A lot of the songs on here are nice and smooth with catchy melodies and pretty music including dance party jams and sex ballads. I took off 2 stars because first of all, some of the lyrics and moaning are vulgar and rather unnecessary in some tracks, and second of all because she, jimmy jam and terry lewis have not made an effort to create fresh music on this CD as they have with previous albums. Rockwilder was an additional producer who didn't bring much to the table, but Trust a Try was certainly a highlight"
3,PRETTY BORING,"I have been a Janet fan ever since her first album in 1984. I buy everything she puts out on the day it comes out. I don't think this album is one of her best. It has some wonderful songs on it like ""Someone to Call My Lover"" and ""All For You"". But the slower songs just drag the album down. ""When We Ooh"", ""China Love"", ""Would You Mind"" all sound alike after awhile. I tried to listen to this album the other day, and couldn't get thru it. It's about time she came out with something new. But with the Michael scandal going on, I think she might lay low for a while longer. This does have one of her best songs EVER on it, ""You Ain't Right"" ROCKS! So here' hoping her next album is on it's way."
3,could have been better,"this album is just not as good as her previous albums, especially rhythm nation, janet and velvet rope. While there are a few good tracks like all for you, trust a try, son of a gun, come on get up, the rest is either medicore and similar-sounding to her other songs, or the language is just disgusting and at times uneccessary. She may look beautiful on the cover, but don't be fooled. Wait for her next album instead. Hopefully it'll be better."
2,Potty Mouth,"Having been a Janet fan right from the start and enjoyed seeing her rise to success, I was REALLY disappointed with this latest CD. Sure, the usual great dance formula and a couple of superb tracks, but why oh why did she have to have such foul-mouthed tracks on their too? I would have thought her talent (and even great looks) would have been enough to guarantee good enough sales figures, but there's no way I'd let my kids (aged 4 to 10) listen to this CD like I would her others. ""Mother F*****"" littered throughout? Come on Janet, you were the one that a couple of CD's ago told us that we have to think about the children as they are our future. Not to mention on this same CD giving thanks to God. Go join NWA or do a duet with Eminem, but don't appeal to the masses if you have a conscience. OK, I'll get off my soapbox now!"
3,Interesting,"Reminded me of some of my break-up poetry. Very graphic, but I noticed Janet has been getting progressivley graphic in the lyrics."
2,Miss Jackson...needs to lose the nasty,"I was so excited for Janet's new album, and when I heard the new single I was ready for more. It is a shame that I've found ""All For You"" a little disappointing. The first set of tracks are amazing, with ""Come On Get Up"" being the best song on the album. After that she dives head long into ballads of blantant sexual flavor. I don't have a problem with Janet telling us that she feels ""juicy"", but it is over done. ""Velvet Rope""(her best album yet!) had the whole sex thing going on. The difference on ""All For You"" is that is seems misplaced. Janet needs to find some new material to work with. Cause when she sticks to less risque themes, the girl rocks. ""Someone To Call My Lover"", is terrific, and ""Trust A Try"" really makes you sweat. ""All For You"" is worth the money to buy it. Janet can't please everyone and I am sure that there are millions of people who don't agree with me, but that's the beauty of life-you are free to form your own opinions!"
5,Itz off da hook!!!,I think this is one of her greatest songs she has ever made and i am lookin foward to getting her new album and hear her other ones!!!
1,Hard to finish,"I found myself continually frustrated with the stupid actions of Miss Zukas, constantly putting herself in harm's way."
2,The storyline drags on without end.,"The plot sort of tumbles out of the story rather than unfolds. Ms. Zukas is the sterotype of what people perceive librarians to be, she also seems to have some obsessive-compulsive traits. Ms. Zukas should have been the third victim, since the only compelling character in the story was Ruth."
4,Brother John,"Brother John is a ""Thinker"" it challenges you to find the missing links. I really enjoyed this movie it was ahead of it's time and the cast was top notch. Brother John is a classic and I think it's well worth your time to see it. Sydney as you know commands your attention in what ever he stars in, so sit back and enjoy the ride."
2,Misleading,"On the back cover states, ""Women over 55 can go o college for Free."" Still looking for that in this book. Perhaps, they forgot to include it? Don't like the putdown about men in the front pages either."
4,"Not flashy, but does the job","If you're looking for a no-frills rolling pin that gets the job done, than this is a good one for you. Not super polished, or aesthetically pleasing, but as far as rolling pins go, this is as good as any other."
5,Great resource,I have the original version and I refer to it all of the time. Very informative. Note the number of pages - this is a great resource. now I'm buying the updated version.
4,HUGE skin improvement,I take this 3x a day and have had such great success!! Skin looks flawless in just 2 wks!!Great quality and price!
3,More Like Barbie Doll,This film is more notable for it's notoriety at the time of it's release than any aesthetic qualities. Tennessee William's story is meandering and unbelievably talky. The film's so-called eroticism isn't likely to give you goose pimples. Carroll Baker's performance in the title role can be compared to wood. The film's virtues would be some good camera-work and Southern ambience as well as outstanding performances by Karl Malden as Baby Doll's cuckolded husband and Eli Wallach as Malden's business rival. Not a complete waste of time but not worthy of it's reputation.
3,works but delayed,this unit can detect the raders/lazer but the timing its too late. when you pass the cop thats when its starts to make the noises. its not worth it
1,this one is bad,"I cannot recommend the seller Lazslo67. He sent me the wrong CD, and I could not reach him to try to sort things out. Oh well. you take a chance when you use sellers you've never heard of."
4,Typical Jerry Hatfield,"Jerry Hafield's books are of the finest quality. Well researched and very full of the detail one expects in a book of this nature. Hatfield follows the entire history of the Scout from the beginning to the end. Included are many great photographs of restored and original machines. Much of the racing history of the Scout is included as well. I gave it four stars because it is a paperback, mine will wear out quickly I am sure."
1,Not What I Expected,"I agree with everyone who has written a review for this book. I waited forever to get the book, and I was so excited because I used the Read It! Draw It! Solve It! book with the second graders that I student taught, and it was highly recommended by a math coordinator at my school. I just knew that when I got it I was going to use it right away with my students. But I was wrong. It is not the book that I expected. I don't even want to keep it. I am thinking of giving it to one of my students. I wish I would have the read the reviews before wasting my money."
1,Way to easy for second grade.,"I bought this to try with my second grade class, and was really disappointed. The problems are way too easy. I was hoping for something that would help them practice their problem solving skills, but this was not it. Save your money."
4,Love it but the price ugh,Used it for the first time today.... I love it I'm even gonna try it as a spot cream. It says to leave on for 5-10 mins but I suggest leaving it on for 15-30 or until it dries. It definitely firms and smooths and you will see smaller pores after just one use!!!!! It is expensive but just a little goes a long way so it will last a while... Hopefully! I would have given it 5 stars but I couldn't do that with the price so it got 4.
5,nice,My order arrived on time and esay to open. everything as described and i really like it. I am willing to buy again
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"I cannot believe I paid money for this book. There book is filled with factual errors and misrepresentations. I will not be so bold as to call them outright lies, but the information is wrong. I finished it just to see if it got better but it didn't. The book perpetuates myths left over from the war and more that have been fabricated since. There are no notes to check the authors' reputed ""sources,"" the research is shoddy, and the text is laughable. This should be in the section under histical fiction - not history. As a historian I would suggest that the authors stick to sculpture and theatre (see bios)! I was very dissapointed with this book but not surprised at the content from two amateurs."
5,I like it,"My wife was very pretty in that top. I wouldn't look very good in it, though. She will probably deal with them again."
5,Excellent Introduction for Social Scientists,"Gill's book is ideal for psychologists and others who tend to recieve minimal statistical training but want to learn (1) why to pursue Bayesian methods when p-values seem to be doing okay, and (2) how to start with those methods. You need to know about various continuous and discrete probability distributions, and also what an expectation is (I'm serious, many psychologists don't), so if all you know are the mechanics of t-tests, ANOVAs and regression, you have to buff up your theory a bit before reading this book.Nevertheless, the book walks you through things and includes code in every chapter, which is rather helpful. Psychologists wishing to use this book will need to download R and Bugs (freely available for Unixes, Macs, and Windows), which involves programming and is not as simplified as SPSS."
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"This book is riddled with errors and mistakes. I have tried reading the first 3 chapters and found so many errors and typos that it makes learning the material virtually impossible. I have given up! What's more: the errata website only has found some (but not all) of the mistakes). I have literally spent hours on a formula not understanding it, only to realize that the reason I didn't understand it was because author didn't take the time to write it down correctly! Very frustrating!!!DO NOT buy this book! I SWEAR you will regret it! You will spend more time trying to troubleshoot all the errors and mistakes as opposed to actually learning the material. I would return this book if I could- it's basically useless..."
4,There are better video recordings,"Unfortunately, this video performance was made too late in von Karajan's life. The only outstanding performance is from the little known soprano, Izzo d'Amico, who displays a firm knowledge of the Verdi singing line. The rest of the performance, visually and vocally is a dull reflection of the aged conductor's temperament in his last years. Too bad."
4,Wonderful,"Jose Carreras and Agnes Baltsa are in excellent voice for this performance, Piero Cappucilli is fairly good but i'm biased because i don't like him very much. The biggest suprise comes from the King (i can't remember his name but his face is right infront of me) I saw him as leporello in Don Giovanni with Bryn Tefrel and Renee Flemming in the title roles and he is much younger in this and in much better voice as well. WELL WORTH THE BUY!!!"
2,Okay Product,"When I first got this item, it was great and had alot of fun with it. However after about 2 months of use, the switch on the microphone broke. I wasnt able to change from the PA to the siren function and back."
4,Just like when I was a kid,This item is very similar to the siren I had on my bicycle when I was a kid. All three siren sounds work well and the microphone/loudspeaker works nicely. Just what I thought it would be.
2,Does it work?,"well, received the product and opened it. All looked OK. Inserted a new nine volt battery per instructions. Tried the microphone and OK. Tried the #1 siren and Ok, Tried the #2 siren and Ok. Tried the #3 siren and the same as #2. It should be a third type and no good. Only two of the sierns work. Not good.I wouldn't buy this horn."
2,Poor Quality ... Don't Waste Your Money,"Do not waste your money on this. Very poor quality... I'll be amazed if my son gets the rest of the summer out of it. The bracket that mounts it to the handle bars broke within the first few days he had it. I had to make a new bracket for it. Go for a more expensive, better quality product... this is junk!"
1,ok,I just got today it was early but its junk its not loud at all and its tiny and wont go on my bike!
1,GE Driveway Monitor,"Really bad! It just doesn't do what it is supposed to do. It is relatively inexpensive which is why I bought it at Lowe's. I guess you get what you pay for. Goes off for no reason and now won't even respond to vehicles at all. Oh, and there is the battery issue: it takes 2 ""C"" batteries in the transmitter and they only last a month or less. I bought rechargeable batteries for it but these are 1.2 volts instead of the usual 1.5 volts. These rechargeable batteries register ""low battery"" on the receiver after about 2 days. I refuse to spend the $259 for this kind of metal-detecting monitor (such as Dakota), so I guess I'll just stick with the infrared type even with its limitations. What was GE, an excellent company, thinking with this piece of junk? Unfortunately, I didn't keep my receipt to return it. Live and Learn!"
1,not a good read,"The author works for Focus on the Family, which should be a big hint about the content.At one point, in the conclusion, he essentially gives parents permission to spy on their kids! And if your kid is obsessed with death and dying, you have a MUCH bigger problem than Wicca. Plus, that kid is goth. There's a difference.He's really out to scare parents more than anything. Most of what he says is deliberately not going one way or the other.Read another book if you want to learn more about Wicca."
3,Not Enough Space,"A fine intro to the subject, but it makes for somewhat dry reading. A men-at-arms title also does not have nearly the space for plates or text that this broad of a period deserves, but the author does an impressive job of describing the equipment of not only the classic legionaries, but also of both infantry and mounted auxiliary cohorts. The plates are also pretty good."
1,Very disappointing,"As a fan of psychedelic visuals done artfully and tastefully and as a discerning fan of avant garde filmmaking in general when it's done well, and lastly as a DJ who likes to show his collection of trippy films when DJing, I found this to be hugely disappointing. Boring visuals that go nowhere and aren't very trippy, beautiful, or disturbing in a fun way at all, which are some of the qualities I look for when checking this type of thing out. No mind expansion to be found here. Just a couple of guys d-cking around on their computers with no aim in sight. I would steer clear of this one. I saw it mentioned on someone's list of video art essentials and I have to say that that list led me astray. Look for Ron Hays Odyssey video or laserdisc or California Images: Hi Fi For The Eyes video if you want something that has true mind f-ck capabilities. This dvd sucks donkey d-cks."
4,Good Shoes Even if You Don't Run,"I am disabled and use these shoes for gym work, softball coaching, and light walking. I was concerned about having a combination of a supportive shoe that would not wear quickly in front (as I tend to land there disproportionately) and also having a shoe with the flexibility to walk when walking for me can be difficult. These shoes do not dissapoint. They are light, and firm, and quite comfortable. I don't buy a lot of running shoes, but I do look at a lot of shoes of different kinds. These do not disappoint. I thoroughly recommend them."
1,Oh dear,"I don't think I've heard an album with such appalling production values as Sacrifice. You would have thought after a career spanning more than two decades Gary Numan would be able to engineer and mix his own recordings competently.Sacrifice is another droning earache of an album with absolutely zero dynamics. Song after song the same drum loop is used ad nauseam. Sonicaly it's all over the place, you can't hear what's going on so if there really are great melodies on this album then they're lost under a muddy wall of sound.Maybe somebody within the Numan camp should tell him he can't engineer, mix or produce to save his life? Unfortunately Exile, Pure and the latest sonic disaster 'Jagged' all suffer from teeth grindingly hideous production and sloppy mixing."
3,Needs a little corrective sewing,"Garth is a really plush, comfortable dog but I happen to have gotton one with the seam down his back really slanted. I like to keep him on bed for show mostly and the seam down his back in the first place reminds me of when my real life Lab had spinal surgery and needed her back stapled to heal(she did fine) I suppose as a kid I wouldn't mind but he's more for show and I wonder why anyone would make a connection down its back anyway?Kathy Domenech"
3,Too Different,This was a great idea. Remix Kool and the Gang hits with the help of different artists. The problem is that the new versions are so different from the originals that in some cases I did not even recognize the song. Jungle Boogie was destroyed. I can't even listen to it. The disc has it's monments but in my opinion they should have stayed a bit more true to the originals.
4,Still relevant!,St. John's On Marriage and Family Life is so biblical and still relevant for the 21st century. There are only a very few things in these writings that might be considered more historical than practical. This book makes a great wedding or anniversary gift.
1,Many of these were already issued on Volume 1...,The Rhino release of 1990 included many of these tracks.....What happened to Apeman.....or Lola????..This compilation is a complete waste of money
1,A Must To Avoid,"There is nothing much to recommend about this CD, other than the songs ""Sunny Afternoon"" and ""All Day And All Of The Night"". The rest is filler. Sure the price is OK, but the sound is average and if you enjoy this music at all you will find yourself wanting more. Rhino's ""Greatest Hits, Vol. 1"" compilation is a better place to start."
2,The Fallen Brides,"Firstly, let me say this. The book really isn't all that bad. It just really didn't end up as one of my favorites. I thought that was rather too bad, because I was excited about reading, one of the less retold fairy tale storiesI thought the story was slow passed and I didn't like the fact that abuse was such a key plot line in the story.I honestly don't mind such stories, but I just didn't really care for the way that it was represented.I found it very little entertaining and thought the writer switched writing sequences quiet a bit.Not the worst retelling fairy tales that I have ever read, but not the best either."
1,Do not Last A Very Long Time,"My box states that this bulb ""lasts up to 7 years"". In a ceiling lamp in our kitchen our lamp lasted 15 months. Why buy a more expensive bulb if it has such a short life?"
3,Russellian with a vengeance !,"Russell is undoubtedly a brilliant mind and this sometimes goes with a cryptic expression... But here, the ""sometimes"" turns into ""a lot"".If you are both patient and ready to skip the convoluted, if not indigestible sections, then you might safely reach the last page of this monumental work.If not, then a better route is to use Russell's later ""Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy"", where he tried and succeeded in clarifying and correcting his thoughts in just 200 pages.This is not to say that PM doesn't contain illuminating sections, it does but they are gems, lost in dense magma."
2,"Too philosophical, however few applied didactic","I don't recommend this book to dynamic people who like to link theoretical concepts with practical examples and exercises. It is too massive on phrases (all the time), very extensive, 528 pages written. At the same time, neither figure nor minimal equation are found, you can count those up only in one hand. I consider this book as not being attractive nor neither exciting reading."
4,looks well,"Would have given it five stars if the time handles would glow in the dark without my aid, packaged well, came in time span given."
3,Delivered product came with bad fuse,"The transmitter was shipped to me with a dead fuse in the adapter end that you plug into your car outlet. Fortunately, I had a replacement handy from an old adapter I no longer use, so I did not have to go through the hassle of returning the product. Still, it's disappointing to receive a new product that does not work properly right out of the box."
4,The Bolero/In Search of Cezanne,Thoroughly enjoyed watching/hearing each instrument play Bolero and the crescendo is awesome. In Search of Cezanne was interesting but a little blah.
4,"Good Music, 5.1 is out of sync",Basically the concert is great. I liked it a lot.However the DVD comes with 2 channel sound and 5.1 channel sound.The 2 channel sound is fairly good and it is in sync with the video.The 5.1 channel sound is more full and lively but is not in sync with the video. There is NOTHING you can adjust on your DVD player to get the 5.1 channel sound in sync. All you can do is switch to the 2.0 channel sound.I think the manufacturer should do a recall on this DVD and fix the 5.1 out of sync problem. It is incredible that this could have been released like this in the first place.
5,Love Goes On...,"Great series--another love story line that gets better with time. Even though problems come up (and there are many) the couple always seems to work things out intelligently and with dry humor. You will love this series also, so sit back with your Earl Grey tea and soak up the show."
2,Mind numbing detail....,"This long, dry, chronological listing of sightings of UFOs would certainly benefit from a little more narrative snap. It is easy to believe the author's contention that UFOs are treated like a national security issue, and that the government doesn't want to share any information. Nothing suprising there. Still, the overwhelming quantity of sightings listed simply proves that a lot of people have seen a lot of unusual things. But the book doesn't offer any new definitive evidence. If the reader conflates quantity with proof or explanation, the book is compelling. If you're inclined to want more empirical proof, this book won't give it to you."
5,UFO'S AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE,A well written extremely well researched book relating to UFO and the Governments ability to hold the public at bay. I give this book my highest rating a must read for the novist as well as the professional UFO enthusiast.
2,"My dog loved it, the short time it lasted....","My dachshund loves fleece toys and her fleece balls are her favorite toys. I bought this fleece ball for her, since her current favorite ball is no longer available for purchase.She loved this ball! She loved the size, the squeaker, and the feel of it. She played and played and played with it for about a week.After just a week of heavy dachshund use, I came home one afternoon to find stuffing all over the dog room. The ball had wither sprung a leak or my dog had been able to chew a hole in it in just a week (Her previous ball lasted through almost a year of heavy use). My dog fought me for the remains of the ball(because she did love it), but alas, it had to go.I am still searching for a durable, fleece ball. This one did not pass the ""dachshund"" test."
5,"An All-Star, Grand-Slam Reference","Paul Dickson's latest book confirms -- as if confirmation were needed -- that he's the Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Hank Aaron, yeah, and Yogi Berra, of baseball language and lingo. The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, is more than just a new edition, it's a completely revised, updated, expanded grand-slam achievement. Fans of the game will find it more useful than Google when it comes to definitions, origins, usages, history and anecdotes of the language of the great game. I checked my dog-eared first and second editions, and they're rookies compared with this new dictionary, weighing in at over four pounds, with a whopping 10,000 terms. Great photos and illustrations are eye-catchers on just about every page. Dan Webster, eat your heart out! Every baseball-loving kid -- and Mom and Dad -- will make excellent use of this book for years to come, in season and off. I know I will.Robert SkoleBoston"
3,For one Christmas only.,"I bought this with hopes of using for the years to come, but it ripped on the first day Christmas. Mind you, I actually put presents in it, but only a few toys for the kids, a doll box being the culprit of the ripping. Not very sturdy material, although if you're using solely for the purpose of dressing as Santa and only plan on filling it with soft stuffing, it would work just fine."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This bag arrived and I put my Santa Costume in it to take out of town where I play Santa for family, and Friends children. The bag completely separated at the bottom and all the costume was lost out the bottom without my knowledge. Clearly there is no quality control or care. I should have taken note from the other reviewer stating the same thing about the bag bottom not being secure, and avoided ruining a great family tradition. This bag was a disaster, and should be sold as a wind sock. Horrible product and immensely disappointed. Amazon needs to cut this company."
2,"A book of ""guessing"" exercises.","I genuinely didn't get any thing out of this book. I do believe that Ms. Day may possess special powers and I enjoyed reading about her psychic experiences, but her exercises seemd arbitrary and definately did nothing to increase what she calls ""Practical Intuition"". Apparently, one is suppossed to become more psychic by asking an obscure question and turning the page and finding out what they just predicted. I would recommend this book as an interesting read, but not a guide on how to harness your practical intuition."
2,No Intuition,"Though I believe many people have intuition, I believe I have virtually none. I was hoping to develop my intution with this book and worked with it on a daily basis. I can honestly say I have seen no change. The book was an interesting read, but not helpful to me."
4,Great Reminder to follow your own knowing!,"The Author did a wonderful job of assisting you to remember about times and places that you ""knew"" something but pushed it aside. She helps you slow down a bit and take a moment just to get in touch and get back on track. Very good, upbeat book!Practical Intuition"
3,the book,"read don't have a clue what this is reference to, just a bit confusing. If I could I would have send back to the store..sometimes things are no what they seem."
4,Jeter Dive in Crowd 8x10,Photo is pretty sweet. A classic of one the greatest players of my generation on his quest to hit 3000+ hits.
1,wouldnt seal right,I tried a couple different methods to try and seal it so it wouldnt leak antifreeze and after tearing it all apart three times i finally got it. I dont have the time for bs like that.
5,Life is still life...,"This book shows a little of the effects of the changing world since the time it was written. But it is still well written and it's still funny.That's because though we have other things to worry about, some basic things stay the same. And maybe it's not stated in the current trend of the week, but life is still life and family is still family.So buy this book, read a bit and see if you don't laugh out loud over it. I'm betting you will."
5,"""like a musician playing his instrument""","This is the best recording of Richard Strauss' Alpine Symphony.Here's why:It is a stunning piece of music--an auditory journey up an alpine mountain, complete with sunrise and sunset, and even an impressive, powerful mountain storm.Herbert von Karajan shaped the Berlin Philharmonic into perhaps the best orchestra ever. Von Karajan shows how, like a musician, a great conductor ""plays"" an orchestra as if it were his instrument.This DVD allows you to see, up close, the conducting details and nuances of body language which get so much more out of the orchestra.The DVD format also allows you to check back with the program titles to verify what the music is describing.The photography and sound recording could not be better.You will have a better seat, a better view, than anyone at any concert.This is an opportunity to see a great conductor perform a great musical work on his personal instrument, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra."
2,A Slow Read,"""Pentagon"", by Allen Drury is an OK book. When I began to read it, I was hoping for it to be a thrilling read. However, I soon became bogged down by overwhelming detail.The story begins when the Soviets gain control of a small island in the South Pacific called Nanukuvu. It is then up to the Pentagon and the joint chiefs of staff to solve this problem. However, for a couple of hundred pages, absolutely nothing happens. The majority of the book consists of the chiefs of staff of the army, navy, air force, and marines saying that they are the best and that they must be the one to reclaim the islands. There are a few small subplots, none of which held my interest.If you are interested in how the Pentagon works, this book may be for you. I found that aspect somewhat interesting. Otherwise, it was just a slow read that I had to struggle to finish."
4,Good Flashlight,It seems to work well but it is not very bright compared to other led lights.It is much better than the non-LED version.
1,the new 3-d cell maglite led flashlight,the new maglite led 3 d-cell flashlights with a DL in front of the serial number.i have found problems with thim burning out with in 2 to 6 months. i have gonethrough 3 maglite led 3 d-cell flashlights with in 2 years. i got all 3 of maglite led3 d-cell flashlights at my local Costco. i don't know what maglite is doing but tharnew maglite led 3 d-cell flashlights ar not as good as the older maglite 3 d-cell flashlights.i give the new maglite led 3 d-cell flashlights 1 star out 5.i give the older maglite 3 d-cell flashlights 5 stars out 5.
5,Made in the USA = Awesome!,"I'll keep this short and sweet. A sleek design, LED light and made in America equals awesome! This flashlight is rock solid and has served me well. I only buy Mag lite to support the workers in Ontario, California and to support made in America. Quality and pride!"
4,"Mixed feelings, but a powerful light","This is my third one of these, as I love the light but keep having battery issues. The beam is strong and easy to focus, and in theory the LED should last forever. BUT I neglect to change the batteries the minute I notice the light begin to dim (after a few months), and they swell and get stuck in the barrel. As a result, I keep having to buy a new one. I'm not really sure it's the light's fault, but the barrel is VERY tight, so if the batteries swell at all, you're in trouble...But I like the light enough to keep buying them. Maybe this time I'll change the batteries quicker."
5,Awesome,"I bought it for my husband, he loves it. He has done a lot of research on them and said this one is diffidently one of the best for it's size. You can also adjust the focus which is a nice feature that most of them don't have in the same price range. It's a great deal."
5,Great Moisturizer for super dry skin,"I'm a red-head. I have naturally pale, red, sensitive skin and I have had a continual problem with dry skin on my face and forehead since adulthood. I've tried lots of lotions and this is one of the only ones that truly deals with the dry skin issue on my face. It has a pleasant smell - somewhere between concentrated Tang and spice tea. I haven't noticed a huge difference in 'calming' my naturally red skin but I think it has had some impact. Highly recommended as a moisturizer."
2,Was hopeful,"Was hopeful as most people with psoriasis are, but after a few weeks, I have still not seen any difference. Ive tried so many OTC products and prescription products, but most are at best transiently helpful...maybe a biologic is in order, but at $1000++ a month...I guess Ill keep applying away!"
5,my ministry,"the only ministry album worth listening to, save the singles 81-84 which is not really a true album. all that guitar noise messed up a potentially great band. too bad. when I started listening to ministry THIS is what they sounded like - still have all the early 12 singles..."
5,Search Engines 1-2-3,"A must read for marketing managers and individuals who are serious about their companies search engine listings. Mr. Konia takes the mystery out of this very broad field with straight to the point no nonsense explanations and examples. This book explains not only the nuts of bolts of Web Position Gold 2, but also how to effectively implement WPG 2 in a short amount of time. The section relating to link popularity I found particularly useful considering that I was unaware of just how important and effective this is. Two thumbs up!"
1,Misinformation galore,"I can't believe that such out-of-date misinformation is actually for sale. It's really well-known that search engines really don't like this program. Search on the web for information and you'll find a lot of people losing their IP addresses, and even their domain names, in search engines. Why would you take the risk of being banned by the major search engines, when it's a fact that the engines recommend to stay away from this stuff? I would not recommend this book at any price. I loved the totally-wrong myths at the end though: ""It's a myth that search engines don't like doorway pages."" Yeah, search engines really love it when you try to pull tricks like that. Sheesh.."
1,Bad quality and poor service from seller -Fell apart on first short plane trip!,"One wheel fell off on first short plane flight! Contacted seller and they said to contact manufacturer. I suggested they replace or refund it as the quality is so poor, why fix something so poorly made? They gave me the manufacturer's number. Left a voice message first call with no response. Second call, spoke with customer service and they gave me a local luggage store for repair. The local shop said this bag would keep falling apart as it is poorly made and suggested I purchase a $700 bag marked down to $420, how generous. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this poorly made bag or purchase from this seller as they don't seem to care about customers."
5,DO THE SPANISH HUSTLE,"This is the re-release of the ORIGINAL ALBUM from 1975 (originally on Event/Polydor Records). Spanish Hustle clocks in at 5:16, However, there was a promo only 12"" release clocking in at 6:24. This version should of been on the cd as a bonus.. ""Do the Bus Stop (are You ready)"" was the other hit."
2,Cheaply constructed,"Parson shows a knack for arrangement production that can be assembled into gratifying material though it rarely surfaces, instead supplying a majority of luke-warm, datedly synthesized radio rockers."
2,Disappointing...,"I really don't understand the 5-star reviews on this album! It has none of the almost ""mystic"" yet dynamic feel of the ""Tales..."" album, and lacks any superb tracks such as the ones found on ""I Robot"". Furthermore, it seems that the APP here tries to get kinda Beatle-esque but failing to a great extent. I hope that this is not what the Beatles would have degenerated to had they continued recording into the 70s! The music sounds too pseudo-romantic and more appropriate for teenage girls of the late 70s to early 80s. The only tracks worth anything here are ""In the lap of the Gods"" and the album opener ""Voyager"". The rest are musically (but not lyrically) boring filler material and can be easily thrown away in a trash basket. For anyone wishing to find out about the genious of Alan Parsons, please do yourself a favor and get ""Tales of Mystery..."" and the ""I Robot"" albums which are far superior to ""Pyramid""."
3,"not quite what I had expected, but satisfactory","I was hoping for something more like Turn of a Friendly card.. but its okay, Service was great though. thanks"
2,Masters Student textbook,"This book was so advanced and technical that it was almost entirely useless to me. It is clearly for an advanced sound technician, someone who is going to be building concert halls and what not. I was looking for something with information on building a sound studio for a client. Too technical, too advanced. If your teacher doesn't require it, why the hell would you buy it. I gave it a 2 because someone will make use out of it somehow, someday, somewhere...i guess."
3,Kidnapers and Aliens and Hot Girls--oh my!,"Anyone who expected to see a sequel to Men in Black wasn't very bright, in my opinion. But on its own, this is an entertaining, low-budget alien flick with a little sex appeal thrown in to keep it interesting. Typical pulp fiction on film. Quit analyzing and enjoy!"
3,Not a bad watch,"I think it's a decent movie.It has nothing to do with the Will Smith Men in Black movie, on the contrary it very much seemsthat it borrows from the legends of ""real"" MIBs just after the Cold War. I was turned onto it bya friend that's into scifi/horror, went into it with an open mind, and was pleasantly surprised.The story is a bit disjointed to follow towards the end (Editing? Hard to tell?), however ithas good acting, it has good looking women , and an interesting premise (don't forget popcorn).If you dig Indie stuff that isn't from Hollyweird, I think it's worth a watch."
5,I agree,Hey I'm from Cajun Country too and i totally agree with the following from skism.... definitely a must - have for dj's and definitely a better track than castles in the sky. I agree it's great!! DJ Trashy mixes it in his music perfectly.
2,Once rocking band turns SELLOUT,"Pathetic. This band used to have a good,hard edge, but then they put this trash out and try and become this American Hair band. GAG! Don't waste your time here - get Headhunter or One Vice At a Time for vintage Krokus. This album sucks, although Ballroom Blitz isn't too shabby."
3,I just want to say,"This was a good cd but I just think there are a bunch of beter ska bands out there like, scofflaws, toasters, and reel big fish. I love ska but I'm also a big fan of punk. Some of the best bands are screeching weasle, nofx, less than jake, and swinging utters."
5,Dronkey is the Cutest!,I bought this for my 16 year old and was very pleased with it's overall appearance and softness. This is so much cuter in person than you can tell by the picture.
1,Incomplete - Disappointing,"If you own the 2 LP Album, please be warned that the CD isn't complete. Much missing. I loved the album very much and wore out my copy, so I was psyched to see that this came out on CD. I immediately bought it not even thinking that it wouldn't contain everything the LPs did. That is why I titled this review ""Incomplete - Disappointing"". Don't get me wrong, though, if you have never heard the LPs, then you won't be disappointed. This is a great recording, just wish it was the same as the LPs."
1,"Good price, diamonds not so good",Within a few months of wearing the earrings I noticed a black speck in the center of one diamond. I took it to my jeweler to have it cleaned and was told that the speck was an inclusion. The inclusion became visible because the layer that covered it had shattered. The black speck is still there. It completely ruined the pair of earrings for me.
4,yes you can refill the cartridge,"simple enoughI used a refill kit which comes with a small hand drill, rubber stopper hyperdermic and two bottles of ink.Drill into the top (I did it between the raised part of the cartridge) once you break through inject into the foam with the hyperdermic needle put in the rubber stopper. then insert cartridge in printer lie to the software say it is a new cartridge and off you go. Colour is a little harder i believe because there are 3 ink wells to find. it is a great little printer and fairly economical once you know how to refill :-)"
5,NOT A ELECTRONICS GURU,"I Had a 7in one brother that I paid a lot of money for sevral years ago,it finally went out and I bought this little jewle to replace the printer function. it was easy to set up,its very quiet and prints better than my old brother,I do not print photos just legal documents and such it works perfectly for me and ink is just a little more than my old brother was,its simple and easy to use,and when it goes out it wont hert as much to replace it.... lon"
4,JL parfum,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars, is that this parfum doesn't stay with me very long, so it won't last as long as I would have liked. I tried it in the store, but it was late in the day, and after shopping like most, women I took my bath. So I really never knew it wouldn't stay with me. I have had these px's before, so it isn't the parfum's fault or the seller's. It smells really good, and has a powdery note to it. Go for it unless you have had the same px that I have."
3,Ok Cologne ... Nothing Special,This is and ''Alright'' CHEAP cologne for a guy.This only has Staying power I would say for up to 2 hours MAX.Ok for the Price $$ on Amazon .Smell is Average. Nothing Special.
2,Best Ever,"Cooking is my passion and I have many cook books but this one is the best!! Each recipe looks exactly like the picture of the finished dish. The instructions are clear, the ingredients are readily available. This cook book is the perfect Bridal Shower gift. If you can read, you can make it."
2,Comedy on the cutting floor,"Partners In CrimeJust got Volume I and did not get the comedians I saw back in the 80's.Barry Diamond, one of the funniest in the first HBO special was cut out. What a loss.Robbin from Chicago was also out from Babe's kids fame. He died too early and now he is not on the DVD.The comedy I remember must be on the cutting floor.Partners In Crime"
5,Sinatra sings for the love-lorn,"This is a wistful CD of 12 tracks, five of which are tunes by Irving Berlin, recorded in 1962 for the Reprise label. The Berlin tracks include the cathartic `When I lost you' that Berlin composed in 1912 after losing his wife Dorothy Goetz of just five months. It is such a contrast to the rousing Alexander's Ragtime Band, Berlin's first hit composed only the previous year. The other Berlin numbers are `What'll I do?', `Remember', `The song is ended' and the title track `All alone', all of similar mood to `When I lost you'. From these, you'll get a feel for the mood of this CD, which nonetheless is sympathetically sung by Sinatra and beautifully backed by the sumptuous swooping strings of the Gordon Jenkins orchestra. The mood is like that of the other Sinatra/Jenkins collaborations - No One Cares and Where Are You? This is not one for fans of the up-tempo swinging Sinatra but rather the reflective lover facing newly arisen solitude.Where Are YouNo One Cares"
5,My Favorite APP Album,"When this album came out, I was in high school working at the school radio station, and I played the heck out of it. I know every note of this album by heart, and it's one of my fave APP albums. Loosely based on Isaac Asimov's robot series of books, it has some of the most memorable APP tunes, ""I Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You,"" ""Breakdown,"" and ""Day After Day."" Highly recommended as a good ""starter album"" for folks interested in APP."
5,Great stuff,It's been a long time since I heard this album (now a CD). It was great to hear it again. It sounds wonderful. Terrific mastering. What else would you expect of Alan Parsons. The extra bonus tracks are quite interesting as well.Its on my iPod and is a regular go to for some laid back listening.
4,First Parsons release for the masses is excellent.,"This was actually Parsons' second release, following his unique and wonderful ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"", but the first to appeal to the mainstream. Of all his creations, this one probably resembles ""Dark Side of the Moon"" the most. The instrumentals are masterful (beautifully enhanced by Andrew Powell and the Philharmonia Chorus), with the title track providing the model for many future gems and the ending two tracks (""Total Eclipse"" and ""Genesis""), providing a riveting plunge into despair and escape to joy. The songs are solid, with the touching ""Day After Day"" and the eerie ""Some Other Place"" being the standouts. On the downside, ""The Voice"" evokes a drug-fogged visit to a disco, something sorely out of place on this otherwise masterful creation. (I would actually give this four and a half stars, if possible.)"
5,a boot stamping on a human face for ever,"This excellently-written book brings you closer than most recent war journalism to Orwell's famous description of the brutality of dictatorship. Through the story of his own brief but terrifying incarceration in Iraq's worst prison, and through the stories of Iraqis who spent a far greater part of their lives being ground down by Saddam's machinery of violence and fear, he paints an stark picture of the mechanical, dehumanising repression of the Baathist regime. As we debate the legality of the war in Iraq and as Bush and Blair start to feel the pressure, this important book reminds of the sheer bleakness of what came before. By doing so, but without being partisan itself, it should make the reader ponder whether simply leaving it there would really have been the noblest path."
4,"A little praise, where it is due!","Contrary to what other reviewers have said about Mr. McAllester's book, I found the resonance of personal trauma against the backdrop of totalitarian regime not only insightful, but also frighteningly similar to other scenarios from around the globe (the South African and Chilean situations come immediately to mind). While I was moved by the personal story, I was edified by the greater context against which his trauma occurred. And given the recent situation in the United States (Homeland Security, anyone?) -- also terrifyingly close to home!"
3,Does it really work?,I've used this three times now and still haven't seen any significant difference from using a regular cotton terry towel. I have long thick hair and purchased this microfiber towel to reduce the dry time but I'm disappointed. Perhaps this works for people with less hair?
2,useless,these reviewers must work for the Aquis company...i bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond and returned it right away... not nearly as absorbent as my old Martha Stewart for Kmart cotton towel. Save your money!!!!
4,A SURPRISINGLY GOOD ALBUM WITH SOME HIGHLIGHTS,"I enjoy this album because it represents a garden variety of Frank's early 60s work on REPRISE. In addition you get arrangments by Riddle, Costa, Zito, May, Hefti, Oliver and Jones ALL on one CD!There are some classics (LUCK BE A LADY and W/O A SONG) and some beautiful rarities (GOLDEN MOMENT, EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE WRONG).In fact GOLDEN MOMENT (arranged by Nelson Riddle) stands out on this album as the best swinger while LUCK BE A LADY is the best ballad (arranged by Billy May).None of these songs were either released or hits as singles and this album only hit No.34 on the charts - not bad considering it was overshadowed by the FAB FOUR and of course Frank's own releases at the time (SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS and A MAN AND HIS MUSIC)."
4,Decent,"Decent quality shirt, bought to cut up for a Halloween project. I have to put nine more words in here."
5,Good book for Advanced JAVA applications,"this is a cool book. I just got this book week ago. Very nice description about Networking, RMI, Streams."
3,Righteous as always,"I wanted the anthology CD as the first one I got I've enjoyed so much. I like this one, it just didn't blow me away."
1,"For the last time, WICCANS DON""T USE DARK MAGIC!","What a horrible way to look at a beautiful, loving religion. Don't buy this. If your family member is Wiccan, be proud of them for choosing to love their planet, their family, and their selves. Wicca is a religion of love and respect, and NOTHING dark. This author is a bigoted idiot."
1,pathetically researched,"This book is basically a rehashing of every objection that Christians have ever come up with about Wicca...As for the claim that is was well researched? Maybe if he had bothered to read more than one or two books and call himself an expert... This book is far from the ""truth"", and far from an accurate portrayl of this religion. To reccomend this book for any family, Christian or otherwise, would be to reccomend a blatantly written out of context pile of half-truths and outright lies that isn't worth the trees that got cut down to publish it..."
3,"All good songs, some better than others","I think this cd is pretty good. The best songs are, by far, Shakedown Street and Fire on the Mountain. But, all the others are good to jam to, too."
2,"Decent songs, bad album","Five of these songs worked very well in the Dead's live shows (Good Lovin', Shakedown, Fire on the Mountain, Miracle, Stagger Lee), but to hear them played so anemically here is painful. Anyone who has heard an incendiary live version of Scarlet Begonias>Fire on the Mountain will cringe at the version of Fire offered here. Don't bother unless this is the last GD album to complete your collection."
2,Not the CD for the start of your Dead Collection !,"I bought this CD after hearing classic Dead songs, such as Uncle John's Band and Friend of the Devil. This sounded NOTHING like those songs. It starts out innocently enough; Good Lovin' is a decent upbeat track. With the exception of Fire on the Mountain, it goes downhill from there. The vocals become invading and annoying, switching lead vocals often (who the heck is that chick on from the heart of me??). At times this record is too easy listening, at other times it's too arena rock. It finishes with the weak ""If I had my love to give"", which sounds like a B-side Paul McCartney top 40 ballad. Leave this album on the shelf, or better yet, don't buy it at all!"
3,Don't look at picture samples,"If you have a (digital) camera, you're not a pro or advanced amateur and you're shooting your family or friends, read this or a similar book. However, the picture samples don't support the text. That's the big problem of this book to me. Mr. Hurter has put together a decent text that explains the rules of posing but there are no pictures with these rules clearly applied. Even worse, some of the pictures are the exceptions that **break the rules**. It doesn't seem to be the efficient way to teach somebody the basics.So, I decided to read the book by not paying attention to the pictures and then to go back and try to get any value from the samples I paid for too."
3,"Not the best, but...","Well, I'm a long time Alan Parsons fan. I hadn't heard this album in a long time and had forgotten how weak in material it was in comparison to some of the Project's other work such as Tales of Mystery and Imagination, Turn of A Friendly Card, and I Robot. Still, it does have some great songs that I'll always enjoy, but I won't enjoy it as a complete work. The remastering is great. One can't complain about that. For the diehard fan, it is, of course, a must have. If you are not a diehard fan, you are better off just buying the 3 cd import collection."
5,Works Great!,"My neighbor is a mechanic, and looked this part up for me after the fan in my 2005 Chevy Silverado 2500HD stopped working. I called the dealer to get a price on this item and it was $132.00 just for the part. That's not including the diagnosis fee or labor of $100.00 per hour. The part literally took 5 minutes to replace and fit and worked perfectly. Apparently, this is a common problem in the Chevy and happens often."
4,The Exceptional Presenter,This book arrived in very good condition. Very pleased with the price and service.
2,Weak Contents...,"Few chapters are good (non-verbal communication, understand your audience), but rest of the book does not have much to offer. I suggest reading ""Presenting to Win: The Art of Telling Your Story"" by Jerry Weissman."
1,ripped off buy the seller,this disc skipped on two tracks i emailed the seller four times never got a responce i dont know how amazon can let this happen so all in all i was ripped off.Eve
4,Long time APP fan,Am I the only one who noticed that the intro to the Lucifer track made use of morse code letters to spell out e-v-e? ( . ...- . )Little things like that are part of what I really enjoy about APP albums. They're all a must have.
2,A disappointing sham. Avoid if possible. Rent if you must.,"Short Take:If you want an engaging, secular sing-along video, look over the various videos by The Wiggles. If you're looking for the usual Biblically-based stories and songs by Big Idea, try any of the other VeggieTales videos. This video gives the impression that Big Idea is trying to go more ""mainstream"" and it suffers badly for the effort. If you are already a VeggieTales fan, my recommendation is to avoid this video and rent it only if you must. If this would be your introduction to the VeggieTales characters, please seriously consider one of their other videos before this one...."
5,Still a classic!,"I still love this album! The songs are still in my head. More than just Hold Me Now-the rest of the album is just as superb. Smartly done pop songs with loads of rhythm and catchy choruses. They have some mean funk beds on songs like Into the Gap and No Peace for the Wicked and Who Can Stop The Rain. Doctor, Doctor, while unusual, has some unique pop landscapes. It was the group's finest moment--no other album they did before or after could top this."
5,"a great song to bring back all the good old memories,...","Turn out the light, sip a cup of a coffee, listen to the song "" The year of the cat "" ...Reminding you something?----All the memories of your good old days."
1,Wrong version,"I bought this CD in the beginning of January and it took 20 days to arrive. Once I finally got the package I gave to my husband as a birthday present. After 2 weeks he finally told me this is not the original CD, it is another version with different songs and a little speech between each song. It was too lat for me to returned. I just wished a little information somewhere. Very disappointed."
1,Vapor Review,"I would like to be able to review this item, but that would not be fair to the author, because Amazon shipped the WORKBOOK instead of the TEXTBOOK which had been ordered."
1,"Oh, my!","I was looking for new CDs, this one came up. I read the reviews. I bought it! This is some of the most depressing music I have ever heard. Similar tone to Janis Ian. If you are looking for depressing, non inspired music - go for it. I wish I had saved my money."
2,Slightly Better Than Average,"Having very sensitive skin I was very excited to see that this product works well with skin prone to irritation. My shave started out well, but by the next morning I had practically the same amount of razor burn and ingrown hairs that always plague me the next day. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product as it didn't work much better than your typical generic shaving cream."
2,Bitter Dickie,Dickie came across a little bitter is this otherwise good video.I cannot wait for their shows to come out on DVD
2,Annoying,"We were really excited that when this DVD was released. We love the Wiggles and Steve and Terri Irwin. Unfortunately, I find too much of it annoying and my kids don't really like it either. I feel that some of the songs were desperate efforts to take up time on the DVD. What does the live stage performance of Queen of the Roses have to do with this DVD? The cockatoo squacking is intolerable. The emu is freaky. Koala song boring. We like The Australia Zoo and the Butterfly songs."
2,My 2 year old who only wants to watch WIGGLES.....,"My 2 year old who only wants to watch WIGGLES 24/7 (if possible) isn't too enthralled when I pop in this DVD. Some of the worst songs they have ever done are contained here. Sounds like they made them up as they went along - line by line. I wish more WIGGLES selections were on DVD. Until then, we'll have to get them from satellite.....(This is my first review, so bear with me)"
3,Didn't they watch this after edit?,"This is a good DVD for your kids, as parents it will drive you crazy if you try to watch it with them. They didn't match the spoken words with the movements of their mouths...arg!"
3,Scary Wary,"This is the scariest thing ever. The stupid Croc Hunter is rolling on the ground protecting what ever goodies he has. And then there is this terrifying wet suit scene with Captain Feathersword. I really doubt anyone wants to see what I saw. To make it worst there were some songs that went on to long. The cameras switched to fast making me want to barf. But, some were entertaining."
5,"Different from the other Wiggles movies, but so much fun!","My 3 year old and 18 month old consider this their 2nd favorite Wiggles movie (after Hoop-de-doo!). It is a bit different than the other Wiggles videos--it is set outdoors and co-stars Steve Irwin, the crocodile hunter. My boys were captivated with him & love the catchy songs, especially ""Crocodile Hunter"" and ""Snakes: Look but you better not touch"".This is guaranteed to hold their interest, which I love. And the songs, while very catchy, don't seem to stick in my head quite as long as songs from some of the other videos (which is great from my point of view!)"
4,Wiggly Safari,This is a good to very good Wiggles product with an emphasis on the music. It also provides educational material on the various Australian animals. Bpth the 4 and 2 year old granddaughters enjoy various segments. We had a videotape of this but chose to buy the DVD so that they could focus on the segments that they liked more readily if time was limited. The product does this well.
5,We love it as much as our son!,"This is the first and only Wiggles video we own (our son is just 16 months), and we are just crazy about it. Our son was immediately captivated by it and as he has gotten older, he has started mimicking hand motions, clapping, dance moves, etc. My husband and I CONSTANTLY catch ourselves singing the songs around the house (Little Dingo being our favorite)....the songs are very clever and fun. We love animals so this is the perfect fit for our family.To me the Wiggles are just the perfect children's performers....loveable, expressive, slightly geeky, but never talking down to kids. They are great performers and songwriters and I love all of their unique quirks. Steve Irwin (and the entire Irwin family) add so much to this wonderful video and remind me what an enormous talent and spirit was lost with the death of Steve Irwin. He was so enthusiastic, creative and genuine. What a tragic loss.I will be getting more Wiggles videos but I suspect this will remain my favorite."
2,Skip it -- read The Postman or Earth instead,"Brin starts with an interesting idea, but seems to just write himself into a hole. The conclusion is sudden, and feels like Brin is just desperately filling in the aforementioned hole. He's done much better."
3,hp6540dt inkjet color printer,"the only downside to this printer is that it does not have any font & font size option and the fact that you have to go to each single client's desktop to configure the 250 sheet tray (set the paper setting to go from either top to lower tray or vice versa) otherwise, it'll keep using the default tray and will not automatically use the other tray. besides that, printer works just fine."
1,Do Not Buy,"This is a terrible printer. My second lexmark and I will never buy another one. They are cheap, print terrible and have a lot of problems like jamming paper and expensive ink. You can always buy another printer cheaper than buying ink all the time. Look for a better printer than this. Better yet stay away from this brand altogether."
5,Sutherland Sings,Joan Sutherland is magnificent. If only she were still singing today. The recorded performance is as good as it gets.
5,A Man Alone,Cd arrived quickly and if you are a Sinatra or McKuen fan this CD is for you. I have enjoyed being taken back to another time with this one.
4,baywatch Hawaian Wedding,I thought it was a very well done movie when it was on TV. It was great to see all the old stars but the Stephanie look alike was a bit much for me though. Mitch should have know something was up from when he met this gal.
1,Don't make my mistake !,This is the worst cartoon I ever saw in my life. I bought it for my son - he couldn't bear to watch more than 3 minutes. No connection to Jule Verne whatsoever.
5,Realistic Look at Prostitution,I was drawn into the story of abuse and couldn't put it down until I had finished 12Th Street Rita. It's a true story of how one girl becomes a prostitute and how she gets out of the life. It's very graphic in the details and I felt I was there with her on the streets. I cried with her and I laughed with her. It's a page turner with lots of adventure.
4,Not too bad,"I got this becuase I find that my triple barrel iron sometimes(even though I like it) gives me smaller waves and I was looking for something to more or less give me body and wave. So, it kinda ended up looking like my triple barrel and it heats up really, really hot which worries me as I don't want to damage my hair. All in all, with experimenting with this product it wasn't what I thought it would be but it's not bad."
2,Not a digital,It met my need for a battery checker.The amp meter is OK. I would fear checking higher voltage.Spend the extra money on a digital.
2,Analog Multimeter,"Defective unit,impossible to measure ohms. Was advised by Vendor a new unit will be shipped as per e-mail of Kaito Electronics Inc. dated June 04,2010 with additional promises afterward and no action so far. Very disappointed about the situation. Please clarify as soon as possible this unfortunate transaction regarding the multimeter.All previous purchases were excellent. Thank you..."
2,"Very cheap and shoddily-made, but it does its job","Lightweight; pretty accurate as far as I could tell; the analog arrow settles quickly enough and doesn't bounce too much.I took it apart today to replace a blown fuse (which was my fault). Plastic pieces are held together by screws (!), and gray plastic shavings were coming out as I unscrewed them."
3,Decent analog tester,"hello to all!recently i buy this item, is color red, not yellow like the photo...i do not like the range for measure d.c ohms,, only covers x10 ohms, and x1kohms...anyway , good tester in general..hope you liked my review,, thank you very much!"
4,Essential for the Home,"After trying several digital millimeters which either failed or were inaccurate to the point of being useless, I decided to go old school with an analog multimeter. I was not disappointed. It appears to be quite accurate, versatile, and easy to use. This does not have the quality of a Fluke, but it doesn't have the price and for my purposes it is quite adequate. If you use batteries in your house, and who doesn't, this will pay for itself by identifying batteries that are still good but appear to be bad because of a corroded contact.I recommend this highly for general household use."
3,Hat Organizer,I bought the organizer to store my golf visors. For the smaller visors it was fine but the wider ones didn't fit well. I released the seams to broaden the pockets and it worked well. I think it was designed with the baseball cap in mind but you can make it work for golf visors.
3,its not all that...,"The two rows on the edges are big enough to fit my New Era hats.But the middle row somehow were smaller, so I could not hang anything up."
2,Overdoor cap organizer,I like the organizer but I am disappointed because the hats fall out of the organizer quite offten.
1,over rated,"I was severely disappointed by this movie and wished I had saved my money. I loved 'The shop around the Corner', but this comes nowhere close to the charm and wit in that film. The acting is stagey and unconvincing, the story tedious, the dialogue has no wit, and I found it completely uninvolving. Sorry folks, a dud."
1,"Boring, tedious, monotonous....",...not to mention obvious. Most 'insights' are already built in our nature and anyone that has held a job or delt with management in the last 25 years will be familiar with the techniques. Jerry Hirshberg can drone on forever. This book could (and should) have been a 25 page pamphlet.
5,Most Romantic Movie I've Ever Seen,"I love sappy love stories. Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Titanic are magnificent films. But, this story is special to me. Cagney's undying devotion and love for Sheridan melts my heart. Ah what can I say but ""You'll always be my girl"". I've searched for over 25 years to find a copy of Steiner's magnificent New York Rhapsody, and just got it. I'm listening to it as I write this. Great, romantic movie. One of my favorites."
5,Excellent director debut,"This is one great movie to watch--Denzel's director debut rates 5 stars plus--great acting-very emotional movie-deep deep movie--I would recommend this film to everyone--it grabs you till the end-- a must have for that collection --this is a true story and Denzel directs this in a very professional style---buy it now--if you rent it, you will want to buy it. Don't waste time-buy it now!!!!Sorely missed from the Academy awards."
3,A little too thick Mr. Washington.,"Antwone Fisher is a good film based on a true story but Denzel Washington's directorial debut is a bit much and soapy. The acting is great from Washington and Derek Luke but the way the movie is portrayed is unsettling and emotionally draining. The story of Antwone Fisher is heartbreaking but I just feel this film is one-sided. Good story, bad execution."
4,Movie review,"The movie was really good and with many hidden messages. As a therapist in training this story can teach us a lot about the cultural discrepancy that are out there, however many things that Denzel shouldn't have been done as a counselor. An example would be bringing his patient to his family get together. But, looking it as a movie alone I have to admit it was enjoyable."
4,Movie Review Antwone Fisher,"This is a classic! You won't be disappointed in this movie at all. You will laugh, cry, sigh, and smile. You don't get to see many movies at this caliber anymore."
4,the trouble with foster care,"The trouble with foster care is that too many do it for the money and not for the love of children.This sad story of one little boy's journey thru the systrem ,sadly,is not that unusual.He happened to have the talent to convey his suffering on paper and tell it to the world ,but there are so many who bear the scars who do not sell their story .The system is broken and needs to be fixed.Everyone should see this movie to have a better understanding of the children who survive foster care.Perhaps it would inspire good people to become foster or adoptive parents.There,of course,are some great foster parents out there but too many like the ones in Antwone's story."
3,Good for what it suggested but it missed more,"this is the kind of Dvd I was excited about because I love the films during that time period alot.there was so much going on that isn't fully told on this disc.you need 2-3 discs to tell the whole story&even then you are bound to leave something out because there was so many other details that came into play.these Films saved Hollywood back then until the BlockBuster films like Jaws,Star wars,etc... came along.Many actors&actress's from these films didn't get a fair shot in other films.the Cosmetic 80's downplayed this era as well.but thanks to the Hip-Hop Movement these films&Creative forces got a Bigger lift than ever.so many Great Talents that haven't gotten there full due to this day."
3,Good songs; weak delivery,"This album has some great material, but it's a poor reflection of the band's playing. Brokedown Palace and Franklin's Tower sound pretty good, but this disc overall doesn't seem to capture the energy of a real Dead show. It's worth listening to, but there are better sets out there."
3,"Cute, but stick with ""Dick's Picks""","Buy ""Reckoning,"" the live acoustic album, instead of this one. Really truly amazing acoustic performances."
5,Silence and I,"This is one of my all time favorite albums, and in my opinion the best APP album followed by Turn of a Friendly Card. Turn your system up,lay back, close your eyes and listen to Silence and I. If you are like me you are transformed to imagry of riding a great stede through a forest to the rescue of of just about everyone. If you want to feel good about yourself, you gotta get this album. Phsycobabble is outstanding!"
5,I love this CD,Absolutley great. I'm a fan of The Alan Parsons Project and I can undoubtly say that Eye In The Sky is one of their best.
3,sinbad,"This cartoon is light on story and only fair animation, but ove all a good work. and an interesting take on the Sinbad ledgend. Kids will like it and if you can buy it cheap, go for it."
1,Nothing New,"Disappointing. We were hoping for some new material from this fine artist. All he's done is signed on to a new label and re-issued songs, mostly off Stone Doors and the self titled David Broza, which we already have. Better to buy those two CDs because there are several great songs that couldn't be crammed on to one ""best of"" CD."
5,Serendipity,I accidently found this group while listening to my favorite online radio site/station. The first song I heard was 'Cold as Minnesota' and immediately fell in love with their sound. This entire album makes me feel good all over. I've recommended this album to several friends who have a similar music and they've all loved it.
2,One Trick Pony,Jeffrey McDaniel is a one trick pony: he writes one surreal punchline after another. Hopefully he'll branch out with his next collection and not use that same old shtick again and again.
4,Re-Speaking His Own language,"A master of the quirky metaphor and possessing the guile of a guilty child, McDaniels seems atuned to the zeitgeist of contemporanity in a way that few poets are able to evoke with out falling into sophomoric self-parody (such as Beau Sia and much of the other young NYC scene). But through the odd juxtipositions that McDaniels is able to blessedly, and wickedly, un-find, he creates tremendous psychological arguments in the smallest of lyrics. You may find yourself laughing outloud and then unavoidably realize there's some real darkness underneath this surface texture of humour. I call these poems ""un""-poems-- that is they are un-unusual and un-graciously un-refined, like James Tate back when he still knew how to write. But better."
5,It's very practical and useful.,"After reading and following some exercises, I have improved a lot in my right hand. Now the sound generated from the bow is much better and I'm going to explore more in this book."
3,A lot of this advice seems intuitive,"This book offers what seems like sound advice, however, for me, it all seemed intuitive. All the suggestions on how to interact with your baby, I was already doing. So there wasn't a lot to disagree with, but there wasn't a lot of eye opening info either. This may be better for parents who are dealing with a colicky infant or an infant who has trouble engaging with the world due to sensitivities. I didn't have these problems with my daughter. I would check this book out of the library versus adding it to my personal library."
3,Watch Out! They run VERY small!,"A nice looking slipper, though the stitching where one of the sides joins the tongue was unstitched on delivery. They also run very small. I'd suggest taking a deep breath and ordering two sizes larger than you normally would, especially if you're planning to wear them with socks!"
2,Big Disappointment,"This is a bit of a muddle. Not professionally written or reported--there is no hypothesis, no facts, no linear thinking that takes the viewer through the evidence to arrive at a conclusion. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Short Version,This release (Alpha Home Entertainment) is NOT 197 minutes as advertised. This is the 163 minutes cut. Returning the dvd tomorrow.
5,"Best Small Animal Bedding PERIOD, Hands Down","This bedding is silken, smooth, comfortable and odor free. Hands down the best small animal bedding ever. Unfortunately, not sure they still manufacture it as I can't get a hold of more.This is a case of the best product losing to cheaper alternatives that are worth only a fraction of what this product is worth.It goes a long way, making it EXTREMELY economical. I hope this company is able to continue manufacturing it."
2,Runs poorly,"Out of the box it did not get around the track very often. It is very sensitive and did not like e-z track. It has a nice look to it, but poor function. I keep thinking it is broken, yet I check it out and really it just is designed too loose. The wheels don't stay straight it and runs all over the track until derailing and even the tightest track connections. Maybe I just don't do steam as this is my first and prob last steam engine at n scale."
3,Not the big body count it says on case but good movie anyway,"On the case it says this movie has ""one of the biggest body counts on the 80s"".not true.only like six people die but their deaths are greusome thanks to sfx by tom savini.the story is acually good and easy to follow and i can see why this called a gem of a slasher movie.once you start watching it has you right until the ending,which in itself is very graphic.i bought this dvd and it will get seen a few times and any slasher or horror fan should add this to their collection,its more then worth it."
4,this is one of the better slasher movies of the 80's,no it's not a great film but from the bin of 80's slasher movies it is better than most. it starts at the end of world war II as a soldier gets a dear john letter and goes home and kills his girl and the boy she is making out with. flash forward to the 80's and after no school dance because of the killings they have another dance and guess who shows up? you got it the killer. tom sivini the guy behind friday the 13th's makeup does his goreyest here and this one has a creepy air about it that sets it apart from most. check it out as the transfer is great and the acting is better than most slasher movies.
3,Savini's effects are the only highlight of slasher classic.,"30 years ago a retuning G.I. received a 'Dear John' letter. Enraged, the soldier brutually killed his former love and her new beau. The dance the couple had been attending has not been held since. Now, after 30 years, that is changing and a killer stalks the teens gathering to restart the traditional dance. Low budget director Joseph Zito (Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Missing in Action) delivers a modest effort here. The movie is solid, but lacks anything approaching a strong or memorable story and lacks visual style. The special effects make-up of soon to be superstar Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead, Maniac, Friday the 13th, et al) is the only real stand out here. If you are nostalgic for the slasher films of the late seventies and early eighties, you certainly could do a lot worse than this, but I can only recommend The Prowler to the hardcore fans."
2,slasher flicks...,"This movie is very very gory, and bloody. Not to scary, not the greatest plot line, but if your into gore it's for you...Worth checking out, if your a slasher movie fan..."
3,Not bad....,"...not great either.A fairly decent 'slasher' flick from the 80's, back when major studios actually backed such projects with big budgets and extensive advertising campaigns.The film is quite predictible if you've seen a number of these flicks, but the QUALITY of the film (the production, the attention to period-detail, etc) is quite above-the-norm in my opinion.Yes, the special effects are quite well-done, but over-all the film is quite draggy, especially in the middle-section-- almost frustratingly so.It's decent, but not essential."
2,Boring Horror Movie,"The opening of The Prowler takes place on Avalon Bay, 1945. A girl named Rosemary and her boyfriend end up murdered on the night of their graduation dance. Fast forward 30 years later, 1980- the killer has never been found. Now there's another dance taking place and the killer is back to kill the teens with a long knife and a pitchfork. The killer also has a connection with the war from the 40's.This movie was incredibly boring and the killing with the pitchfork didn't do it for me. The long knife was cool but this movie just dragged on and on. The characters were very uninteresting and the killings weren't that great.This was your typical average run of the mill horror movie with the same old plot and lackluster characters.Special Features: Audio Commentary with Producer. Director Joseph ZitoSpecial make up effects Tom SaviniTom Savinis behind the scene gore footageTheatrical TrailerPoster and still gallery"
2,Cheesy,"I bought this movie and Pieces. I thought both were cheap and cheesy. I like a good scarey movie combined with the slasher factor and neither of these fit the bill (to me anyway.) Maybe if I were watching these-in the 80's- I would feel differently, but they did nothing for me."
5,Awesome Film!,"I am a huge fan of 80's horror, now granted I grew up in the 80's, but they were great times. Thisis an excellent film for any gore fix, or slasher fix, you can't go wrong with this film, make a it a date movie!"
1,Waste of $$,"Purchased this item, from the first day it had sound problems. Too underpowered and didn't sound clear. Today it quit on me. I barely used this amp at all. In my opinion a cheaper amp would have sounded a lot better and would still be working. Pyle never again."
5,The Cuisine of Hungary,"The two copies I ordered, sent by two differe providers, sent copies in more than terrible condition. I am now getting copies from a reliable source. I should have dealt with them in the first place.Margit Serenyi"
1,NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS,"Maybe I am ignorant or fail to do proper research before purchasing, and perhaps it is my fault for assuming the ""one hit wonders"" would all be performed by the original artists. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING THIS ALBUM. The performances are all covers, and poorly executed at that."
4,Riveting!,"Rabb is a marvelous writer! His discription of 1919 Berlin is wondrous. I actually felt that I was there and his flawed detective Nikolai Hoffner is a fascinating anti-hero.The story revolves around the murder of Rosa Luxenburg, who along with other prominent Russian Communists attempted to overthrow the German government in 1918. They were stopped and Rosa was murdered.The story ostensibly is about serial killings of middle aged women, which our detective hero is attempting to solve. There are twists and turns in the plot--but I guarantee you will want to keep reading the book to the end.Rabb brings wonderful characters both imagined and real into his story -- even Albert Einstein has a small but important role in the novel. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is because parts of the book were repetitious and slowed the plot down. Otherwise, it was terrific!"
2,JACK'S BACK..,"This towering, old fashioned story vividly transports the reader to the 19th century. There are many threads involving various human relationships as well as the ""downtrodden woman attempting to overcome the adversity into which she was born theme"".In addition to the ""love story"", the ""success story"", the ""redemption story"", and the ""revenge story"", we are given yet another theory as to the identity of Jack the Ripper.Personally, I didn't much care about The Tea Rose or its'protagonist, Fiona Finnegan, and was more taken with Donnelly's ""A Northern Light"". In that novel the characters are more human, the situations more believable, and the heroine is one that the you can identify with. You actually find yourself longing to see her attain a better life.The Tea Rose put me more in mind of the ""bodice rippers"" by Barbara Cartland that I read as a teen, with a side trip to Danielle Steele land.Sorry, but no rave notices for this one. Two and a half stars."
3,Not What I Expected,"I bought this book because I am a big fan of Donnely's other novel, A Northern Light. However, while the storyline was engaging and similar in style to that novel, this often read like a trashy romance novel or cheap action/adventure novel - but much longer, at 750+ pages. If you are looking for a historical romance with some feminist themes and action adventure then this is it. If however, you are looking for something for something with more substance, that is beautifully written, check out A Northern Light - though it is listed as a novel for Young Adults, its suitable for all ages."
3,Tedious,"I often purchase books from Amazon.com based on the reviews of other readers, with positive results. Unfortunately, this book did not meet up to the previous reviews.If I make it past the halfway mark in a book, I usually finish it. I did see this one to the end, but found it slow, tedious and predictable. I try to avoid romance novels and will avoid this writer in the future."
3,The Tea Rose,"The Tea Rose it a very good book, it keeps you wanting to read more, I haven't finished it yet, but am very interested in it. Usually not my type of book, but getting into it, keeps me wanting to read more."
2,Great Book Poor Kindle Quality,The book is great Absolutely loved it. Wonderful characters and great setting. BUT...the Kindle version is a .tpz file. It doesn't have a Table of contents and it occasionally will mix up the order of a line paragraph or a few times what seemed to be almost a whole page. It was disappointing to be fully engrossed in the story and then be pulled out to try to figure out what they were supposed to be saying. At on point I just skipped a whole page because I couldn't paste it back in the right order in my head.
2,The Tea Rose,"I read & really enjoyed Northern Lights so I thought I'd try The Tea Rose, too. Big mistake! Huge mistake! I still have trouble believing this is the same author. The book couldn't have been more trite with co-incidences abounding. I'm still mad at myself for wasting my time and finishing it."
3,tedious and predictable,"If you are a fan of Barbara Taylor Bradford, Danielle Steele, etc., this is a longer version of their type of book.I was disappointed, as I found the plot totally predictable, and the details tedious.I thought it moved slowly, and was very long for what it was.The book needed to be tightened up, and paced more quickly."
5,The Tea Rose,"I found this book while searching through amazon books just trying to find a good book to read for the summer. This book is great. It has romance, suspense and always keeps you guessing. It is well written, and you don't want to put it down. I just purchased the sequel The Winter Rose. I can't wait to read it."
5,What FUN!,"Action, adventure, heartbreak, humor, suspense, romance, revenge - this is one ride you won't want to miss! You will have a great time rooting for Fiona Finnegan throughout her trials and tribulations and, finally, her triumph! The characters (yes, all of them) are so well-developed it's hard to believe that they aren't real. This has become one of my favorite books of all time...so much so that I couldn't wait for the paperback and have bought many copies of the hardback to share with friends - all of whom have absolutely loved it! Kudos to Jennifer Donnelly for the THE TEA ROSE - I look forward to great things from her in the future!"
5,what a trip!!!,"do you ever need to just forget about everything and escape into another world??? Well, take a trip with this wonderful book into London l888 and you will forget everything else. This is a fabulous book, fabulous love story, suspense, historical details,wonderful characters, etc., etc., etc., I can't praise it enough.A book I have been waiting for, scoured the book-stores for, and finally found it!!!"
1,Just so boring,"I really liked ""Spiritual Tourist"" but this book was *yawn* just one long newspaper article about all the groups that hated and connived against each other. I found nothing inspiring or interesting and grew horribly tired of trying to remember who the 14th Tai Sitapu was, etc. It was a waste of time and energy."
5,Long overdue tribute to heroism,"Excellent read on the life of one of World War II's unsung heros. More than 60 years after the fact, Karl Timmerman's home town has barely begun to recognize his amazing contribution to WW II. A great reading companion to the Bridge at Remagen."
5,Excellent suspense/mystery movie,"If you love a great mystery movie this one's for you. If you love a great suspense movie this one's for you. Blind Terror has a terrific plot, is well directed and acted, and is rife with possible suspects and motives for the stalking of a very attractive and believable young woman who has suffered a horrible death of her first husband several years ago. Plenty of shocks and surprises are in store for the viewer and the ending is in no way ""telegraphed"" right up to the movie's stunning conclusion. We found this gem in of all places a bargain bin and consider it a fine keeper and addition to our collection."
2,Poorly done,"The music covers up much of the dialog, also the same episodes are replayed multiple times. Good program idea, just poorly done."
1,I was snoring by the end of 10 minutes.,"Unerotic, uninteresting, poor acting, impoverished scripting, Asian stereotypes, ridiculous pretension...should I go on?"
5,Jean Redpath,"I love Jean Redpath's performances and have all her CDs. They are my favorite music to play when I'm on trips and need to stay awake while I drive. Not just good for this, but I don't have much time to listen otherwise!"
4,Predictable? I think not!,"I don't know why everyone thinks this book is predictable! When i read this book for the first time as a kid, i thought either Benji would either find some way to make things right with Hammerman (so he wouldn't fight), or teachers (or other adults) would find out about the cloud of Marv hanging over Benji's head and stop Hammerman. The fact that there WAS a fight still surprises me.I think the suthor has a great way of writing children's books-she doesn't talk down to kids, but she relates Mouse's thoughts and feelings in the way a child can relate to. Also, i like how it gives a good perspective on urban life.If anything, i don't like how disinterested Benji's mother was, but sadly many parents just don't take enough time for their kids"
2,Didn't Engage Me (as a kid),"I purchased & read this book in middle high school, attracted by the promise of trying to figure out how to deal with bullies. Yes, there were a few funny bits, but it never really ""worked"" for me -- never engaged my attention. (Didn't have much helpful to say about bullies, either.) The tone and scenery struck me as dismal, Mouse's life seemed pretty pointless and depressing. I re-read it several times, thinking I must be missing something, or needed to give it more of a chance. Nope. Anyway, just fossilized point of view from a kid who read it back when it was new."
1,Give kids more credit - don't make them read this.,"One of the worst children's books I've ever read. Used for reading material in a year 5-6 class, it was predictable and dull. I would not recommend it to anyone - young or old - kids have more brains. The very obvious moral is not supported by any humor or interesting writing."
4,why not?,"I got this item as a gift, and now I will make it a gift for others this Christmas. I am not a 'clean-freak' by any means, but the idea of sanitizing my toothbrush made sense as soon as I started to think about it. The VIOlight worked with my Sonicare electric head, and it was so easy to use. I brush and use the VIOlight just like my old toothbrush holder. No extra steps."
1,Bad Design,"Impossible to get clean and it collects dirty water in the bottom cup. I had had mine for a year and it stops working for no reason often. I also bought a VIOlight childrens toothbrush santizer which also stops working all the time. I would like a wall mounted unit so the toothbrush water doesn't collect and it takes up less counter space. Over all, if you like things to be clean and work reliably, do not buy this one."
1,Waste of Money,"Bought this product here in Amazon a few months ago thinking that it can sanitize toothbrushes. Though there is no proven effect, I got enamored by the idea of UV light keeping the toothbrush heads clean. It was a pretty thing to be seen in the bathroom especially when the bluelight is on but it's not really as sturdy as compared to a regular toothbrush holder. The holding cups are difficult to clean and since it pools fluid from wet heads, I don't see how UV light can keep the heads sanitized. And since it is stored in the bathroom, it gets moist most of the time from the steam of the hot water. It was already broken after 3 months of use. It was really a waste of $45."
1,Unimpressive,Received item promptly but it didn't work and had to be returned. I am still waiting for refund.
3,Violight Toothbrush Sanitizer,"Seems to be working fine. It is easy to use and handy on the vanity. Unfortunately you cannot really tell if it is doing its job, but we are assuming it is as the brushes stay very clean."
1,Boring,"This one's a pass. Starts with some blah-blah-blah about warrior mystique with quotes obviously approved by the public affairs department. Follows with mostly sterile description of battles in the manner of ""this division went up the mountain, got repulsed, regrouped and then destroyed the enemy. Then this other division..."" These battles are supposed to be stirring but all we get here is a mind-numbing list of names, events and dates."
4,"Liked the movie, loved the book","I have been a fan of Ellroy for many years and was so happy this movie was made with such heart and glory. All the acting is great. I loved the recreation of old L.A. In the light of the Rampart scandal, this film is even more timely."
5,Old Hollywood Revealed,"This movie is a fascinating look into old Hollywood and yellow journalism. Danny Devito was at his best, playing a tabloid journalist that was willing to ""get the scoop"" at all cost. A classic!!!Reviewed by Kardia Williams"
5,Great Movie in HD,LA Confidential is a great movie. The performances by all of the characters are superb and the movie looks beautiful in HD. Not too many special effects to warrant bluray but I own it because its still worth it.
5,It doesn't get better than this.,"This is a great film for many reasons. First it has possibly the best screenplay ever.The casting is brilliant. The use of L A locales make the film have a reality that mostof this kind, filmed on a back lot, do not have. It echos the best of Hollywood crime mysteries of the pastin all the right ways. The cherry (no pun intended) on the top has to be Kim Basinger's performance.She moved from Lynn Bracken to a Veronica Lake imposter with ease and perfection. It was subtleand moving. She kept Lynn's pain just below the surface at all times. This film is a must. It is no wonderthat this was the critic's pick for best of the year over the blockbuster,Titanic."
3,Great! - but not my type of thing.,"This is the first time I've seen Kim Basinger in a movie. I must admit everybody in this film did outstandingly well and since there is a New Zealand actor in there, its not the only reason I gave it a 3. I didn't like the story much,but I thought pecticular scenes in the movie were quite thrilling and very entertaining. I must admit I did walk in and out of it a bit but I still thought it was alright."
4,Superbly cast modern Film Noir,"""L.A. Confidential"" - a classic modern Film Noir - depicts a 1950s Los Angeles riddled with corruption and vice, where no-one can be trusted. Bud White (Russell Crowe) and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) two ""clean"" cops with totally contrasting approaches to their work take a stand. Writer/Director Curtis Hanson and Co-Screenwriter Brian Helgeland superbly capture the flavour of the period. The casting is perfect right down to the small roles - and it is ironic that two Australian actors playing the ""good"" cops should work so well in this most American of genres."
5,A modern masterpiece given justice on DVD!,"L.A. Confidential was, in my opinion, the best film of last year and the DVD is just great. Tons of extras that are actually fun and worthwhile to explore, superb sound, and a beautiful Widescreen picture make this a ""must-have"" for film fans. One of the very finest DVD's I have had the pleasure of experiencing."
5,One of the best movies of the 90s,"Truley one of the best film noirs ever made. This breathtaking film takes place in the curruption of 1940s Hollywood with an unforgettable cast including Danny DeVito, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, and James Cromwell and a marvelous direction by Cutis Hanson. This movie should not be missed by anyone especially by movie buffs it is a truley remarkable film."
2,Silly Plot and Childish script,"Whew, what a stinker! This is one of those films that I was forced to fast-forward through many of the interminable boring scenes. Even Danny deVito was wasted in this bomb. Anyone past the intellectual age of 12 should do themselves a favor and watch something else. Is LA is your beat, then check out ""To Live and Die in LA"" or ""LA Story"" -- both excellent films. END"
4,"Great ""film noir"" with two minor glitches","Solid script, nice scenery, and good acting helps propel L.A. CONFIDENTIAL past most other period pieces. The story of a diner massacre that has more to it then a simple robbery gets deeper and deeper as the body count gets higher and higher.However, there are some glitches to this otherwise superb movie. (1). A certain character manages to live after being shot three times. I like happy endings, too, but...it just didn't fit. (2). Another certain character getting blackmailed in a certain way just didn't fit that character at all.Still, it is a good movie to rent."
4,Good entertainment,"If you like cops and robbers, detective stories, Columbo style, with good acting and great sets, you'll like LA Confidential.Story of 3 cops, in a corrupt LA department, with Hollywood at it's prime as the backdrop. Great acting primarily by Russell Crowe, Guy Perce, Kevin Spacey, and Kim Basinger makes the movie especially enjoyeable.An interesting performance by Russell Crowe in his pre-gladiator roles, shows this guy is a real actor, not another hunk. The acting alone is worth watching."
3,Two stars lost in 5 minutes,"I won't ruin the ending for those of you who've managed to miss seeing the movie so far, but the improbable last scene played out at the curb after the awards ceremony feels at best tacked on. If it had been left off, this masterful movie would have saved both its integrity and a full five star rating. Otherwise, three stars for the safe Hollywood ending."
3,It is a good guitar,This product was well worth the money! If you are just starting out I recommend this guitar. For beginners make sure to change string after a lot of use. It is a good guitar!
5,I've enjoyed learning on this guitar,"I've had this guitar for over 2 years now and I love it, I can't seem to find enough time to play. the guitar has endured many road trips (I work construction) and it still plays like it was new. the craftsmanship of this guitar is superb. I'm glad I bought this guitar, it was most certainly worth the price."
2,Not exactly what I hoped for,"After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and order this . It physically looks nice but it sounds pretty bad. Plus, it is impossible to tune and when you do it doesn't stay tuned for long. I will definitely be purchasing something else, this was a waste of money for me."
2,"Silvertone SD3000PAK NA Acoustic Guitar Pack, Natural","The guitar arrived in great condition. However, the travel bag was extremely molded and smelled. It was gross. I wanted to send the entire pack back, but I would not of had a gift for my daughter's 13th birthday. I don't understand how the guitar was not molded but not the bag was. I had to toss the travel. BIG BUMMER!!!"
4,Bang for your buck,The guitar was great . Really nice for the price. Only thing is need to buy upgraded strings.. Other than awesome package!
2,Fun while it lasts,"My son got this ""wagon"" for Christmas 2 years ago. It did not last long. The stickers pulled off in no time and the buttons started to stick."
4,Good but not worth the price,This is a really good daily body wash that left me skin feeling super smooth and soft. Very clean feeling. The downside is it has a bit of a chemical smell. I would prefer no scent or a scent that smells a bit better. It is also expensive.I prefer to use the once a week product to deep clean my skin and get it smooth:[...]
5,"I am a cleansing freak and I love it!,","This product is great. Really cleans and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth, no dryness at all. I love to use it after a day at the beach or at the pool, removes all the chlorine and saltwater while at the same time leaving my skin in great shape"
3,What about the old stuff?,"Juliana Hatfield's ""Gold Stars"" isn't exactly a disappointment, but rather a mismatch between what's good and what's mediocre. Her 10 year career has been unfairly weighed down by 4 new tracks, 2 unreleased cover songs, and 2 songs from her unreleased album ""God's Foot."" This leaves only 12 songs from her released CDs.It's unfortunate that they didn't chronicle her earlier career. ""Hey Babe"" and ""Become What You Are"" are easily her best albums, and they only have three songs from the two CDs featured on this collection. What about the super catchy ""I See You"" and ""Forever Baby"" from ""Hey Babe"" and ""This is the Sound"" from ""Become What You Are""?The best tracks are from tracks 1-5, with the inclusion of ""Somebody is Waiting For Me"" and ""Cry in the Dark.""This CD is for hardcore fans, and people who want to introduce themselves to the extremely talented Juliana Hatfield."
4,Tom and Jerry,"Great fan of Tom and Jerry. Grew up watching them, and am very glad to be able to watch them anytime I want. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you very much"
5,Probably the Kinks best,"Arthur is an outstanding CD. While most rock fans will be familiar with the great song, ""Victoria"" there are many more wonderful, though unfamiliar, songs that comprise this disc. Standouts include ""Shangri-La"", ""Arthur"", and ""Young and Innocent Days"". Also, ""Some Mother's Son"" is one of the best commentaries on war ever put into song. If you're at all interested in the Kinks from this era and you want to move past the many greatest hits CDs that are available, I highly recommend giving this CD a listen."
5,Victooooooriaaaah.....,"Given my tendency to ramble during reviews, I'll slip into my minimalist mode...Arthur and Village Green are not only the two greatest Kinks albums, they are also two of the greatest Rock albums in the history of the known universe. While Ray Davies went on to write many classic songs, including the exquisite Lola, these two albums probably represent his creative peak. There was simply nobody to touch Ray at this time. He just ruled.Next time they send out a deep space probe containing Earth artifacts, they should include these two albums, as a small sample of the work of one of the greatest musical geniuses this planet has ever produced.It's a pity that his genius has only ever been fully appreciated by the legions of Kinks fans. Still, as the man said, it's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world.So much for minimalism..."
5,A beautiful album,"This album ranks up with SINATRA AND STRINGS. Yes, Frank is a bit tired but it does not disturb the singing or dramatic effect in any way. Heck, I'll listen to this one over DUETS any day!Farnon's charts are superb - he could make strings ""sing."" This is an easy to listen to album but not an easy listening album. There is plenty of feeling in the singing and the arrangement support it.If you can't find it here, search the web.."
3,"Not bad, for a reference book","When my ten week early preemie came back to the hospital of his birth, the nurses loaned me this book, as well as one on Kangaroo Care. This is a good REFERENCE book, meaning that it gives clear information on different things to expect from infants born within certain gestational periods, but does not seem to have a supportive emotional tone. Frankly, I am glad I read the loaner on Kangaroo Care first. It was informative as well as comforting during this very stressful time. I am thankful that my hospital not only loaned both books, but strongly advocates Kangaroo Care. I would recommend this reference book be used in ADDITION to an emotionally uplifting book, which would cover all the bases for parents."
5,Dress to Circle?,"I think that this is one of the funniest comedy shows ever. I've seen the original on HBO. If you saw it, then you missed a lot. The DVD has many scenes that were cut for time from the special, as well as a french show (remember to turn on English Subtitles unless you speak the language)."
5,NONE BETTER,"Eddie Izzard is a genious.... and, funny as hell!! There is not point in saying more. This performance is quintessential. He gets more and more funny with each viewing. I NEVER tire of watching Eddie's Dress to Kill performance. I can't wait until it is released on DVD."
5,"Brilliant, intelligent, honest...do not miss this!!","I first saw this special on HBO some years ago and was immediately hooked. I have never seen a standup who uses so much intelligence in a performance. His care and knowledge of history, not to mention his take on it, create the most amusing look at world events and history to this day. I saw Eddie live in Chicago a couple of years back and his show was very different (no drag) and just as amusing. If you ever get the chance to see him live do not pass up, he will satisfy the viewer who has a knowledge of history and world events. For those that gave him a 1 star rating -- a highschool education is a minimal requirement to view Eddie Izzard, if none, stick to Carrot Top and Pauly Shore!"
1,Unfocused rambling...,"Did this guy even prepare for this gig? This whole show is him rambling semi-coherently until he chances upon one of his rehearsed and ""supposed to be funny"" lines which is punctuated by canned laughter. The time I cut myself with kitchen knife while doing the dishes and bled all over the place was infinitely more funny than this drivel."
2,boring,i bought this movie after reading all these great reviews. it doesnt take a lot to make me laugh but i found this dvd boring. its not that funny. what did i miss here??? i really regret wasting my money on this dvd...
5,"As Eddie would say, ""Fantabulous!""","I had the the chance to see ""Dress to Kill"" on HBO and Eddie immediately became my favorite stand-up comedian. He has a wonderfully fresh and unique approach to stand-up comedy. I've seen ""Dress to Kill"" several times and laugh louder every time. I've raved about Eddie to all of my friends who have access to HBO, and insisted that he is a MUST SEE. He's ""Fantabulous!"""
3,Dressed to Kill - Audio Verson,"I absolutely loved the HBO presentation of 'Dressed to Kill'. LMAO, even after seeing it several times. I taped it to add to my collection, but unfortunately, it now has cartoons on the tape...I've searched the world over for the HBO version. I am hoping it will be available soon.I purchased the audio version of 'Dressed to Kill', produced by Ella Communications Ltd.. It contains much more but you are missing the visual half of the performance. Therefore, you don't always get the same impact to a line or a story. However, it fills that vacant spot requiring a laugh now and again."
3,Nice But it fogs up,"I ordered this and thought it was real nice, then the camera started fogging up, it was supposed to be water proof, Amazon replaced the whole set up, but I had the same problem.so now I ordered, BackCam Waterproof Shockproof IR Night Vision Car Rearview License Plate Backup Camera 1-4 Inch CMOS NTSC-PAL With Anti Fog Car Electronics.so it cost me some more Money,hopefully it will solve my problem. if it does, I will purchase another one for my front plate it looks so good when it works.I will post back when I receive the new camera and mount it."
3,Good Camera/Monitor with some issues,"I installed this camera and monitor system in my car based on the other insightful comments on Amazon.Com (The instructions that came with the product were poor at best). First test was inside my garage, mainly for aligning the camera and setting up the monitor display. Nice clear picture. Very satisfied.Drove the car out during the day. With the monitor off, it acts like a rear view mirror, reflecting all traffic in the rear window. However, when you engage the monitor and try to back up, the glare/reflection on the surface of the monitor makes it difficult (at best) or impossible (at worst) to see what's going on behind you. This is a major failing.Testing the monitor and camera at night/in a dark space provides an adequate picture with a wide enough angle to see behind you. In this case, satisfied with the product.I will be adjusting the camera location and position, as well as that of the monitor in attempts to solve the daytime glare issues."
3,camera not compatible with LCD,"LOL what a joke. The camera feed 4:3 video but the LCD is 16:9. So you can either have black stripes on both sides or have a distorted image.The view angle is rather poor. And there is no guide lines (red/green lines from camera).The good? the video cable is long enough. installation is easy. Some complain about the lack of instruction. The fact is it does not need any instruction. Just remove your panel find a 12v power source, then remove the backlight, find another 12v source.After all it serves the purpose. Street parking is really difficult in where I live. The camera shows my bumper, shows the bumper behind me, so I can pull really close to the car behind me."
3,Bad instructions and short cables,"Product received as ordered however noticed that s video cable is not long enough to reach under dash going to rear view. It is short by at least 2 to 3 feet for my application 2004 Buick Rendzvous unless you let it hang down in front of windshield. Also instructions are vague and are not clear on unit hook up. I have dome a couple of simular units so won,t be problem. If you want to install be sure you a familar with set up. You haved to hook to transmission if I understand correctly so I will put on switch to eliminate that problem. Maybe wrong on that will check"
1,Mirror cam,"Don't buy this item; in bright sunlight it is almost impossible to see the image.The monitor is just not up to par, even though the price is very cheap it is not worth the money."
1,Poor Crap. Do not buy this camrera. Very low grade,"I want to strongly suggest not buying this backup camera. Signal quality is weak even though it is a WIRED CAMERA), and the instruction manual is completely useless as many others have pointed out (luckily i know how to install these things). If you intend to use this at night to park your horse trailer like i did, you are out of luck. Do not be cheap like i was, and search out another brand.Hope this helps."
5,good,"I have used this for about a month now, so far it works perfectly, I am very pleased with this purchase, although the directions leave a lot to be desired. It really makes hooking up trailers by myself much easier."
2,"good design, poor performance","Instructions for installation of this camera system were so lacking as to be useless, so be prepared to figure it out yourself. Some help is available on 'google' by searching the brand name and model number.Also, fully one-half of the time this camera system is not usable due to humidity getting into the externally mounted camera and obscuring the view that it is supposed to provide to you."
3,PetSafe Slimcat,When I got this in the mail I was slightly disappointed. but my exceptions may have been a bit high for a cat toy that was just a couple of bucks. It functions exactly the way it said it would.
1,Cat has no intrest,Does not interest cat these reviews should be set up so one could write just a few words but they force one to waste ur time.
3,Not the best product,"The product does work as described. It just doesn't seem to ""hold"" the cat's interest. We have two cats one older one a kitten and never like to play with this. Think the money could be better spend. Would not purchase it again nor suggest it to our friends."
1,Not worth it,"I think my cats are pretty smart, but they didn't get this toy. Plus, the opening for the food was either too small and nothing came out, or too big and it all came out. A good idea with poor execution."
1,flop,"Hated it- too big for cats to play with. Holes did not fit regular dry food or treats. They had to work to get the dry food out-but were not interested in dry food. The treats, that they would work for fell out freely- over in 3 min."
1,older cat not interested,both of our 9 year old cats were not interested at all in the rolling ball. I am sorry to say so because i wanted one or both to like it.
3,SlimCat Feeder Ball,"I bought this for my two indoor kittens to give them some ""hunting practice"" with their food. Unfortunately, the holes are too big for the little pieces in the kitten chow, so bunches of food came out with every bat of the ball. I'm waiting till the cats graduate to a bigger sized food and then I'll give it another try."
5,For my fat kitty,"We had our fat kitty on a restricted diet. It was working fine, until we got a kitten. Then our fat kitty, Spooky, decided it was easier to eat the kitten's food. Well,we ordered this ball, hoping to give her exercise, and it worked. The new kitten loves it too, so we ordered him a ball of his own, in green. I did, however, need to cover up 2 of the 3 holes so food wouldn't spill out too quickly. Duct tape is wonderful and the ball works great. Spooky has lost some of the weight already. Great product."
3,It's bit on the easy side.,"My cats love this and I generally put treats in it before I leave town to distract them from my disappearance. The good thing about the ball is that the sliding chambers means that one can put a variety of different treats in the ball at different times so it never becomes rout. The bad thing about the ball is that it is virtually impossible to set the opening so that it isn't really easy for the cats to get the treats out of the ball. Really, all they have to do is tap it a bit. And if I move it any more closed, then no treats will ever come out -- and that's not fair! Still, it does its job, which is to entertain my boys."
4,Good For Slowing Down Cats...,"4 out of 5 because, while it is great for slowing down the cat eating kibble, I wish it would have more variation in hole sizes to further increase difficulty.I say this because once they get used to it, they will easily dispatch of the kibble.Before the ball feeding method, 1 Tbs would be devoured in a couple minutes.1st week, 1 Tbs would last 3-4 hours.3rd week 1Tbs lasts 20 minutes give or take.While this is definitely an improvement, I wish to make it more of a chore aka exercise for the felines.Also, the locking mechanism is not very strong and poorly made. Perhaps the plastic is too soft for this method of locking.I have already bought 2 sets of these (Thought it would be wise to wash them in the diswasher. Previously mentioned, soft plastic warps in the super heated dishwasher :( duh. ) and would continue to do so until a better product exists."
1,Cat doesn't play with it...,"I feel bad leaving 1 star because clearly the product just may not work for some cats through no fault of the product itself. My cat is young and quite playful, but for some reason she doesn't go for it. Just thought I would let other people know that. Also, please note that the product photo makes the ball look bigger than it is. It is about the size of a large baseball or large orange. I give props to the designer for the creativity of the product though."
1,it makes a mess,I wouldn't recommend this ball. All the treats fall out all over the place and it makes a mess. I just threw it out. I woulnd't buy this products
2,Huge Flaw...,"Used this twice - it worked ok. The kitties didn't immediately get the hang of it, but I think they were starting to figure it out. We'll never know - because it is in the trash! The top half of the ball is two layers of plastic that rotate so that you can adjust the size of the openings - lots of food crumbs got caught between the two pieces of plastic - and I could find no way to separate the two pieces to clean it out. I'm not a clean freak at all - but that would have turned into a stinky, unhealthy bacteria-fest really fast! Yuck!"
3,Cat toy,"The food comes out of this toy easily. I thought it would keep my cat entertained for hours, but she got all of the food out of it in a matter of minutes."
4,Cat loves it,This would be 5 stars if there smaller holes..her treats fall out way too easily. She doesn't get that excercise out of it.
4,It's a Hit!,"So far the two-month-old piglet kitty really likes this ball. She figured it out in no time. The two older Himalayans don't seem too interested, but then again Himalayans are the dumb blondes of the cat family. HA!"
2,It's Ok,"The holes are small and some treats will not come out of it, and when you make the holes bigger, then all the stuff comes out, not a great design!"
4,It does what it says,"I have two cats, and I bought this to distribute cat treats throughout the day when I'm not around for the both of them. It worked as planned for the first couple of days before my ""chunky"" smart cat cracked the code, figured out how to get all the treats out in less than 15 minutes without really having to move much, and left nothing for his impatient skinny cat-brother. If you have an impatient, fat cat, I think it would work great."
5,Forces your kitty to s-l-o-w down!,"If your kitty is like mine and Hoovers everything down in a nana-second, this is a perfect solution. I found this product purely by accident and I'm so glad I did!"
4,Windham Hill Christmas,"A lovely CD. We listened to it while driving, gift wrapping and tree decorating. Classic Windham Hill, evocitive moods and lovely musical settings."
3,Good little trashcan for all purpose needs,"Good little trashcan for all purpose needs is all that is really to be said. The trashcan is very economically built with plastic. Has cut in edges for trash bag usage. Durable, just as I expected from a trashcan, nothing more, nothing less (maybe a couple more inches higher, but it's okay). The fact of the matter is that you can use this for a large abundance of things."
3,"These are Gray, not Beige","The product I received is an ugly gray color, not beige or ivory as shown in Amazon's picture. The color is too ugly for me to use at home. It is twice the size of a normal bathroom/bedroom wastebasket. On the plus side, the product is heavy duty and should last a long time. This is the type of wastebasket that people put near a copy machine because of its size. I think a 3.5 gallon wastebasket is the right size for a bathroom or bedroom. Mine is going in the garage next to my work area."
5,Simple and Effective,"It's a trash can, not much to say if it's working perfectly, lots to say if it fails. Currently, I have not much to say."
2,Krokus - 'Change Of Address' (BMG) 2 1/2 stars,"'Change Of Address' looks to be Krokus's tenth lp.Even though it's not as good as their 'Hardware' or 'Headhunter' releases,'Change...' isn't all that bad.I guess I just more or less favor the Swiss metal outfit.Total of nine cuts here and I liked ""Buring Down The Night"",their so-so cover of Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"",the somewhat cheezy ""Hard Luck Hero"" and ""Hot Shot City"" the best.I suppose that unless you're a major Krokus fan,you might not get that much out of this disc.Line-up:Marc Storace-vocals,Fernando Von Arb-guitar,Mark Kohler-rhythm guitar,Tommy Keiser-bass and Jeff Klaven-drums."
1,Change of Address? More like No Such Address...,"I was always a big Krokus fan, but Change Of Address almost drove me from the ranks of Krokus fan forever, when it was first released. It is pure crap! It's hard to think of a hard rock/metal band that put out such a pile of garbage after some strong albums. Perhaps the Scorpions', Savage Amusement is in the same league. First of all, Krokus again go the route of the cover tune. This time the Alice Cooper classic ""School's Out"" gets the Swiss treatment. It's okay, but hardly innovative. After this tune, however, there's not a decent song here. Synth drivel, & boring, dumb lyrics. The guitar playing is weak, which doesn't matter because it's buried under the syntho-slop. Marc Storace puts in a half-hearted effort vocally. It's as if the band knew this thing was bad from the start. If all this isn't enough, the album cover is among the worst ever- and this is from a band that has an awful lot of bad album covers. Just avoid this."
5,One of the greatest novels ever written.,"Superficially, The Captain is a very well written novel about life aboard a sea-going tugboat pressed into service as an escort vessel for convoys to Brtitain in the early days of World War II. Read at this level, The Captain is a rousing, highly-readable adventure story with interesting, well-developed characters. But there is much more than rousing adventure to this book which skillfully probes many deeply-fundamental matters, including the horrors of war and the true nature of human courage. In my opinion, this is one of the most greatest novels ever written."
1,Where's the experience?,"I'll say what so many are saying about this book - what would Susie Bright know about how to write erotica? Reading it or publishing it, yes, but she's not any kind of expert on writing it, or even editing it -- she puts together a yearly ""Best of"" book of previously published stories, edited by other people. It would be better to stick with what she knows, and the ""publishing"" part of this shows that.And the e-book version is sloppy, and needs a real editor and proofer."
2,Here you go,"The entire article is six or eight paragraphs. Read it here:http://www.hanys.org/newsletters/focus/upload/Spring-2002.pdfFar better information exists elsewhere on the Internet, for example, here:http://www.healthcastle.com/iron.shtml"
2,Same ol' same ol' - Anything BUT Underground,"When one hears the word ""underground"", one usually thinks you are going to get the inside scoop on something or get the unusual, strange or non-ordinary. This book is anything BUT those qualilties.This LA guide gives you the same ol' sites to see that any other tourist book would....Mann's Chinese Theatre, Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame. You might get a good reccomendation on where to eat, but that is about it. Nothing too underground about this book.However, for a tourist book it really isnt bad. Pick it up. Just dont go in with the pre-conceived notion that you are picking up something unusual. it is as good as any other tourist book of L.A."
1,Totally stinks,I didn't believe other people that I had heard dissing this book. Don't let any personal attachment you have Mr. Murakami's other wonderful novels convince you to give this one a chance. It stinks. The most boring of male fantasies. It stinks.
5,Amazing! And Great Translation!,"I have read almost every Murakami novel and short story translated into English, and most more than once. This is a fantastic novel and ranks among his best. Though not as obviously deep and weird as his other works, there is a subtleness to this that rewards the patient and intelligent reader.The tale of hope and loss is as old as literature and Murakami does justice to these thematic elements. I find this novel utterly amazing and rewarding even after several reads."
5,Comming of middle age,"This is a story about regrets. Hajime has one big regret, his childhood sweetheart. When she resurfaces later in his life, he is thrown into a midlife crisis that will force him to make some tough decisions. Murakami carefully crafts each character in this novel, so that you almost forget that it is a work of fiction. He makes it instead feel like a memory. The characters in this novel live in each of us. Murakami is able to force us to look inside to find them. Read this book!"
3,First Love,This is a sad story about a fellow who never got over his first love despite ending well off in life.
2,"Not so good, not so bad","I have read all of Haruki's books that have been translated into English and I this one is by far the worst. In most of his books, Haruki's main character is aimless and the magic of his books is in what happens to the character, not the character himself. It seems that Haruki wants you to like the main character in this book, but unfortunatly he's just not very likeable. Still, though I liked reading it, but if you have not read Haruki before I suggest not reading this one first. Try ""A Wild Sheep Chase"". There are too many loose ends to this one."
2,say what?,"Murakami is a master author. his talent, however, is wasted on this hackneyed plot. After a string of masterpieces that astound and push the envelope of literature, Murakami retreats into a soft-porn world of rehashed characters. It seems that he is afraid to excercize himself. This book is something I would expect from a writer like Danielle Steele, not a master craftsman like Murakami. The talent is still visible through the haze of predictability, though, leaving hope that forthcoming books will return to his previous standards of excellence."
2,This emperor has no clothes,"I can't fathom how this book could rate so many 5-star reviews. It was a nicely-wrapped bit of soft-porn fluff. It reminded me of another prettily-packaged piece of cotton candy from 5 years ago, The Bridges of Madison County. I felt the story line was weak and unrealistic (obsessed by a friend from 7th grade? Hey, buddy boy, get a life!), the writing style -- or translation -- incredibly juvenile, all of which led to a non-ending. Having read these reviews before buying the book, I truly anticipated a great reading experience. But, at least in this case, a good thing did not come in a small package."
4,"Pure Murakami, and what could be better?","This is a short novel by Murakami's standards (only 213 pages) and that's a shame because it's an absolutely exquisite book. I just wanted to go on reading it forever. What it is is a warm, funny, poignant, insightful portrait of a man's mid-life crisis. Although it's set in Japan, the conflicts in the story are universal. This book would be irresistable even if Murakami hadn't thrown in an exquisitely crafted mystery that will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book. Buy it, read it. You won't be disappointed."
5,No More Knee Jerking,"I love my headphones. Great purchase. I was still knee jerking some when I realized if I shortened the headband all problems are now solved.When a product delivers as advertised, you don't mind paying the price."
1,weiman cooktop cleaner -,As Weiman says they are #1 I thought I must be doing something wrong! Read directions again... the product does not live up to its hype!!! My cooktop was not badly soiled but the product would not get rid of the rings around the burners which is the only place that needed cleaning. I am dissapointed.
5,We're all turning 50 this year...,"I thought this was hysterical! I got it for my long time best friend and I know she'll laugh as hard as I did. I did make the mistake of trying to share it at work with some women I don't know real well, and they just didn't ""get it""! C'est la vie...maybe I over estimated their ages...haha!!"
1,Victorias rejects,"Thought this would be funny, but was quite disappointed. There were a couple of ""products"" that made us smile, but all in all I'd not recommend it. A waste of money!"
1,Disappointing,I was disappointed with the content of the book. There are so many possibilities for tongue- in-cheek humor on this subject I suppose I expected more.
1,Burned,Very very very horrible acting.One of the worst low budget movies I've ever saw.... Not worth watching even if were FREE..........!!!
4,Wonderful,"If you like the sound Steve Wonder had back in the 70's with the motown and ballad style, you might find an Undiscovered little Gem. From the get off your butt and boogie opening cut to the final cut I was in Heaven! I have to have more of this guys stuff. It's Wonderful today music that reminds you of the best of yesterday."
5,Brilliant UK Singer/Songwriter Debuts in the U.S.,"I was inspired to write a review after reading the previous naysayer. So far everyone that I have played James for loves it. It certainly may be the reader's opinion that he is overhyped but perhaps it's just because he doesn't like is why he doesn't agree with it.It is completely warranted. After listening to dozens of sloppy albums, this piece of work really delivers. These are songs that get stuck in your head and you find yourself humming randomly.Readers should note that James also has some killer B sides as well. My favorite right now is ""Don't Close Your Eyes"", which is available on one of his singles and some websites."
1,ONLY ONE JAMES MORRISON MATTERS,"...and that's the long-deceased singer from the Doors. This is the latest in a long line of generic honky wimp-rock that real rock and roll has degraded to. Whiny, twenty-something fruits with messy hair weeping over their guitars, bitching to the new ME generation of self-indulgent wanks who think the world revolves around them. Stevie Wonder would be rolling over in his grave, were he dead.In short, a pile of unoriginal puke that will be forgotten shortly."
5,Great music!!,"I just saw a new production of ""Godspell"" with an updated script (minus the original ""Clown Theme"") at a local theatre. I forgot how much I liked the music as I hadn't seen the musical in years. I ordered the CD right when I got home from the show!!"
5,Must Buy for Russian Aviation Buffs,"As part of the innovative Jane's ""How to Fly & Fight"" ,this is an excellent addition on one of the most influential fighter aircraft of our times.Jon Lake profiles the aircraft history,mission scenarios and the Fulcrum's flight characteristics and variants.Also included are magnificent 3-view and layout details by the late Keith Fretwell. Photographs are positively breathtaking.Only aspect missing is a depiction of the Fulcrum in the flying colours of air-forces.On the whole a 'must buy' for Russian aviation buffs.We now await a similar title on the Su -27 Flanker."
1,Bad Book,"I was disgusted by the poor quality of this book. I've read through many test prep books, and this is by far the worst of them. It was full of errors, typos, bad diagrams, etc. I have taken and passed all four CCNP exams, and this book was no help for any of them.The book's test questions were very far off from what I took (including BCRAN). This is a horrible investment; I'd stick to Cisco Press books."
1,Sloppy Work,"In an area of publishing notorious for sloppy work and rush jobs, this book is one of the worst I've seen. Topics don't match objectives, questions are incorrectly worded, poor spelling abounds, and some questions appear NEVER to have been proofread at all. Don't buy this book."
2,Fell Apart,"This item fell apart the minute I put it on the floor. I'm not sure if my dog ripped it or not, but it's made really flimzy. I DO have the bowl however and my dog loves it. There are so many better placemats out there, I really think this one is worth the cheap money they are charging for it."
4,It deserves it,"It really is a good movie, It has a half way decent plot (David is going to steal an expensive car) and it has some cool chase scenes. The cast is b and c list people. It has some pretty crappy acting, but is really worth 1.00 +S&H used. I paid 13.oo for it, and I think it was worth it, I guess I'm just crazy..Well worth to buy in my opinion. A must for people who love car movies."
1,I Should Have Read the Reviews Before I Bought This,"I'd seen this dvd floating around the bargain bins for some time. Finally I figured the price was right so maybe I'd check it out. I should have saved my money.Now, I'm a sucker for low budget B-movies. Usually you get what you expect(or deserve) when you buy or rent them. ""RPM"" had a name cast and was nicely packaged so I expected a derivative but enteraining action flick. Boy was I wrong. Watching paint dry is a much better way to spend 90 minutes.Actually I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. I'm just not that masochistic. I watched the first half hour and then skipped to the later scenes to see if it would get any better. It didn't.I can usually find some sort of redeeming quality for even the worst film, but I'm still scratching my head over this pointless and childish affair. Seriously, I'm going to at least read some online reviews before I buy another movie."
1,Bad Really Bad Film,"Bad Really Bad Film. Good cars, some well known actors, but how many times can I say it: Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film Bad Really Bad Film."
2,The overall product was not bad in terms ...,"The overall product was not bad in terms of moisturizing. When applied, it left my skin feeling tacky until it dried. Definitely not a huge plus. The moisturizing aspects of it were adequate but not exceptional and no more so than a store brand or low end line. The product was fragrance free or without use of perfumes so the smell was not overly pleasant and the back of the jar said to use with another product by Zia but the other product was not supplied. Overall a mediocre moisturizer in this critic's opinion. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,I used Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free ...,"I used Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer and I won't use it again. It gave me an allergic reaction. My face was red and burning for several hours. Even if I liked it, I still wouldn't buy it at its regular price. I haven't used too many different moisturizers, but the ones that I have used never gave me an allergic reaction."
1,do not buy this product,"I loved this mobile when I saw it in the store, but after getting it home and using it for about half an hour it just started buzzing, wouldn't do anything and wouldn't even shut off. I returned it, got another, and after using that one for about an hour the mobile wouldn't turn. Save yourself the hassle and buy a better product"
4,Great Mobile,"We did a fish theme and couldn't find ANY mobiles that worked well until a friend found this one for us!!! It's perfect!!! I don't think the motor is too loud. Babies like white noise and that's all that it really is. My only complaint is that the same song over and over gets annoying! But, overall, it's PERFECT :)"
4,I dont' understand the complaints.,"I bought this mobile despite reading the bad reviews since it fit so well in our nursery. We, and most importantly my son, love it. The calypso lullaby is great and the ocean sounds sound just like the ocean. Also the underwater lighting effect is wonderful. I sat in the dark watching my son fall asleep to it and didn't want to leave because it was so relaxing. The mobile does make some mechanical noise which disappears from notice as white noise after the first minute (particularly when the music is playing)."
2,Nice - Until it stopped working,"We had the same problem others have had. This is a great mobile. Our baby loved it - until it stopped playing music after a week. I have found that removing the batteries and putting them right back in fixes the problem - for another week. Then I have to remove the batteries again.I would not buy this product again, even though my baby loves it."
3,It is okay,"The plusesSeveral stages of use. I love the night light option.The music if catchy.My baby adores the lights and the simple movement, but doesn't smile and kick like he used to with our old whoozit mobile.The negativesIt is very heavy.The colors are not as much of a contrast as others. My baby adores the black and white shapes of other devleopmental toys and mobiles.The fish fall off the spiralThe spiral does not drop down, it claims it will eventually drop down.The music isn't very loud.We have a sleigh type crib and it seems to want to lean to the right becasue fo the side rails.Our baby can not see the fish bowl."
1,Too noisy and motor quit,"My son loved this mobile, but after a short time, the motor quit and now we just have the music. We never used the ""aquarium"" feature since it rattled so loudly. I was also expecting more music choices rather than the same one playing over and over. Very disappointing."
1,Don't buy!,"This product would be awesome if it worked. First the unit wouldn't turn off! So I changed the batteries. A few days later, the unit started making a humming noise like the motor was broken. I had to remove the batteries to get it to stop. I would like to give this product 0 stars, but that is not possible."
1,Does not work for more than two weeks,"We bought this item, installed it on our baby's crib. It worked well for about two weeks until we changed the batteries. After we changed the batteries, it quit turning. We exchanged it for a second of the same mobile. The same thing happened. We do not recommend this mobile. If you purchase this mobile, save your receipt and the box!!!"
1,3 strikes you're out,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this mobile. It looks cute but it just doesn't work. The music didn't work on the first one I bought. We exchanged it, the second one worked for a week then stopped turning. We exchanged that one and now we have the same grinding problem others mentioned and it also wouldn't shut off until the batteries were removed. I know my 2 year old will miss the 'fishies', but my newborn is going to outgrow the mobile before we get one that actually works."
1,I was dissapointed,"I ;ve bought this mobile yesterday, it seems like my daughter loves it, but music doesn't play for 10 minutes:(, It plays only for 2 maximum, so I have to go and turn it on again. I am little bit upset that I have to return it."
4,Not your usual Julian May book,"And this is no bad thing. As many others have pointed out, May's other books--wonderfully good reads themselves, by the way--are very much a different sort of thing than Perseus Spur. The Rampart books are indeed a throwback of sorts to the early sci-fi Lensmen books of EE Doc Smith, but they are full of today's style of brashness in writing as well.Which makes for a great read. This is a good book, with an interesting setting and a fun adventure. It is not a thinking cap book, like her other books, so if that is what you like, you might not like this book so much.And I agree--May must have had great fun writing this book, it would seem. It sure was fun to read it!"
1,Described with 1 word: Garbage,The original 1974 version was nothing to write home about and this movie is beyond that! I wound up fast forwarding through the majority of this movie! How in the world is a new born baby capable of throwing people around like the Hulk???? Are you kidding me!? This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a while! Don't waste your time!
1,Horrible!,"Trust me when I say this movie is bad. The production was terrible. The people talking was low and the music was loud. The acting isn't worth anything and the ending was not only open-ended, it didn't make much sense. Everything that can be wrong with a movie is in this one. Don't be fooled because you recognize the name. This isn't worth your time."
2,was not for my skin,"All skin types are different. I did not have a bad reaction to this product per se... but I did not have a good one either. I used this in conjunction with the Aloe and Citrus Wash and the Sea Tonic Aloe Toner. I used these three products twice a day for about 3 or 4 weeks. My skin was still breaking out a bit and I developed hard little bumps on my face from the products. I bought these because I love the zia oil free moisturizer and the zia deep moisture repair serum... but I'm finding that those are the only 2 zia products that are right for me. If you're trying to fight acne from the outside, proactive works and Zia does not... at least from my personal experience."
3,"VG intro to success in ""dot.com"" using ""real world"" exp!","Let's start at the top - sure Papows was booted out of office for, among other things (such as non-performance), claiming to be a ""Top Gun"" Navy war hero pilot (complete with flightsuit that he kept in his office)- when he wasn't ... oppps! But then again, he did help build build Lotus into a world leadershipship position (before it crumbled after its acquisition - like most do).While his personal inegrity leaves much to be desired, this is actually a very good book (testimony to a split personality or a *&#$ good ghost-writer). It clearly outlines how internet businesses need to capitalize upon the advantages of technology, while building their business upon the basic principles of good business anywhere. If only Mary Meeker, et al had read this book before the internet ""bubble"" burst ...!While slightly dated, this is a worthy read for those interested in what the internet can and cannot do for their business."
1,The previous review is actually for Information Rules,I haven't read this book but I thought anyone reading these reviews should know that the previous review is clearly about a book by Shapiro and Varian called Information Rules. For those of you who haven't read it yet - get it and memorize it. As for this book? I don't have a clue.
2,"Works okay, but leaks a lot.","I was a little disappointed with this marking pen. I bought it just for simple marking lines and dashes on fabric - but it leaks and runs quite a lot. It gets the job done if I don't have anything else handy, but if you're marking for a long period of time chances are it's going to start running all over your fabric, the pen barrel, and your hand. Messiest marking pen I've used in a long time. That said, it washes out just like it promises too with no ""leave behind"" - so I suppose that's the saving grace."
4,works fine,"I was initially thrown off by the packaging, as what arrived is labeled ""EZ Quilting"" rather than Wrights. The fine print, however, does indicate it's a Simplicity/Wrights product. It works fine."
3,Piezoelectric ceramic crystals measure kinetic energy.,"The first publication presenting initial protoype attempts utilizing man-made, Piezoelectric ceramic crystal sensors for measurment of the energy of wind blown particles. The technique proved to be a valuable sensor for the determination of threshold friction velocity. It is depicted as a multilevel particle energy sensor for wind tunnel studies."
2,Walt and El Grupo,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
3,I received the wrong table,"I ordered this product expecting the end table pictured above, but received only a much larger table top that was mislabeled. Amazon's return policy was excellent and painless as usual, however, I chose not to reorder the table. I have seen this table in person and it is beautiful."
1,Rats.,Too tight for the lens it is supposed to fit. It is made well but useless for the 18-55mm DX Nikkor lens.
5,Re:Reformatting for Kindle,"I believe the Sterling Media Group LLC must have re-formatted the Kindle version recently as I just purchased it (August 2011) and it looks great. No line breaks, missing punctuation, or bad OCR substitutions. This is such a great story. It's a must read for lovers of Sterling Lanier's work and anyone who enjoys the fantasy/adventure genre. Thank you Sterling Media Group LLC for paying attention to the reviews and doing justice to Sterling Lanier's work."
3,COULD'VE BEEN A CLASSIC,"No need to go too far. ""Turn To Me"" and ""Doin' The Things That We Want To"" are drop dead stellar, hands down my friend, while ""What Becomes A Legend Most"" grows into sheer Velvet Underground glory towards the end. These aren't mere highlights. They're bleeding classics.Sadly, the rest is ok-ish, reduced to near-banality by 80's drumming/rhythm -- listen to ""New Sensations"", which is otherwise muse-laden songwriting.In other words, it's another Reed album. If you look back a couple of years, it's the 'New York-Album-Syndrome' all over again: A handful of heroic moments accompanied by perfunctory sidekicks.If Reed had only waited till The Great Tunes knocked on his door and released just 1 or 2 albums through the 80's, his legacy would be secured (there are isolated Works Of Art in each release) . But Lou, being Lou, HAD to put it all out.Shame, really, yet this album is worth your dough for the three masterful pieces.Lou, oh Lou!"
1,an awful book,This book really doesn't give you imformation about any kind of web programming. It barely skims the surface of all the languages or scripting languages the book says it covers. A real waste of time.
4,The title says it all,Another great resource book for all churches to have! I adapted ideas for our church with a no-sew method----fabric glue!!!
5,Greatest gloves ever.,"These gloves are fantastic. They are durable, fit well, and keep the hands cool. Purchased these gloves for a Resident Evil cosplay and they were a success. They can also be used for paintball and other recreational sports. The Kevlar knuckles are great on these babies. Affordable and comfortable for one low price."
2,Falls out of mount,"This shower head works fine, but it falls out of the mount very easily. After falling about a dozen times and chipping the shower tile, it finally broke for good. What a waste of money!"
4,"Fascinating, but not always on track","I was excited to discover this book and hoped to find an in-depth look at Catholic teachings and history. The topics Father McCoy covers are well chosen, including God and proof, our Lady, sins, and virtues, but I felt the author could have done more. I appreciated the more or less neutral tone and researched answers, but at times the author, I felt, deviated, from explaining Catholicism to explaining Christianity. I had hoped for more on the Catholic Church. As an introduction to Catholicism and Christianity with outstanding description and discussion of the seven deadly sins, highly recommended, but if you are looking for more, as I was, this book is not worth it."
3,"""ONLY FOR THE DIE-HARD MINGUS FAN""","I USUALLY REVIEW MUSIC/MOVIES THAT TO ME ARE 4 OR 5 STAR'S. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M GIVING MY REVIEW HERE 3 STAR'S. I PLAYED ON MY SHOW,""CELIA"" COMPOSED BY MINGUS. (BUD POWELL COMPOSED HIS DIFFERENT VERSION OF ""CELIA"")IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BALLAD WITH PIANIST BILL EVENS PLAYING A WONDERFUL PATIENT SOLO.FOR A FIRST TIME FAN, I WOULD RECOMMEND;""MINGUS AH UM"",""BLUES AND ROOT'S"",""THE BLACK SAINT AND THE SINNER LADY"","" JAZZ PORTRAITS;MINGUS IN WONDERLAND"" (LIVE)."
5,As good now as it was then,"I was raised Catholic, but I've been in recovery for almost 15 years. In other words, I'm not a religious person by any stretch of the imagination. People who know this about me are always amazed when they hear me raving about or recommending ""Godspell,"" but the deal is, this recording is full of awesome performances and incredible songs, all awash in super-freaky 70's action. .... If you want ""Godspell,"" this motion picture soundtrack is the version to get. It really captures the enthusiasm of the performances without all the cheesy stage musical crap."
5,My favorite musical besides Les Miserables!!!,This CD makes me feel so good when I listen to it. I think everyone should own a copy!!!
1,A has-been,This used to be a great product but not anymore. It works as well as water and water is free.
3,Padded outlaw tale for the hardcore only,"Hmmm...as with LaVigne's books about the Angels (which should be classified as fiction), this one is also somewhat dubious if only for the fact that it is written by another Canadian, but this one is-gasp!-a journalist! Much of this tale , while interesting, is unnecessary. What is fascinating is how many times Stadnick evades the law or getting into any serious trouble, although it could just be that the law enforcement is sub-par. For rabid readers of biker books only."
1,Horseshit...,"Not only is the author a bad writer.....jumping from timeline to time line...not able to tell a story in order.....he tries to pose the Hell's Angels as the bad guys. Anyone with a solid head on their shoulders will see thru his rhetoric and realize HA is a stand up orginization that takes care of business like any normal person would. The crimes they were accused of, weren't crimes at all......they were simply the exercising of human rights against agressors that would try to deny said so rights......in fact in the entire book, i found no fault with the Angel's actions, and applaud them for their efforts."
3,You get what you pay for...,"It was worth the $7 but that's about it. You MUST replace all the batteries or else it will just make noise and light up, it won't move. Getting it out of the packaging was a nightmare but doable. My biggest complaint is that it just doesn't do much. Sat you press the A on the bus... it says ""A!"" and then plays a silly tune. But it just has ABC and 123 and that's it. You press the A on the remote and it does the samem thing except it rolls forward and rolls back, whoppie lol. My toddler gets frustrated with it because it will roll out of distance or she won't have the remote pointed just right and it won't work. But when it works she likes it ok. If you have to pay more than $7 with free shipping on it just say no, otherwise just know you're getting an ok $7 toy."
5,book of jubilees,"this is a very interesting book that was not selected for inclusion in the Bible, yet it was available for the Kindle and it adds insight to those that believe. It arrived as advertised via whispernet under 60 seconds and is an excellent breadth of the variety of books available for the Kindle."
1,Neither Foxy Nor Boxing,"If I could sum up this DVD in one word that word would be 'disappointing'.The cover might promise lithe bikini-clad beauties but what you actually get are chunky girl-next-door types with minimal boxing skill. To make matters worse, the ref seems to think he's officiating a legit boxing show and breaks things up anytime the action gets interesting. That's when he's not adjusting the ill-fitting headgear. Naturally this disrupts the flow quite drastically and at least one match apparently peters out due to lack of interest.As a final note, the host is more than a little annoying."
3,Series slips a bit with this one,"Eiichiro Oda, One Piece: The Crap-Geezer (ViZ, 1998)The Battle of the Baratie continues, with Luffy and the cooks facing off against Don Krieg and his band. We get some background on the relationship between Sanji and Zeff, but the majority of the volume is one big punch-up, reminiscent of Yuyu Hakusho's Dark Tournament story arc at times. A good bit of fun, this, though I'd have liked to see a touch more plot advancement. ***"
4,"Only chapters 4, 5 and 9 make it a worthwhile ""Masters"" book","This book is definitely written for the biologist that knows some perl and not the experienced perl programmer. To the biologists who have some experience, this book will open up many new possibilities, but to a person with a few years of perl experience, many sections are skimpy and wasteful on topics better covered by other Perl books.For example, for anyone with truely massive datasets, it might have been worth the mention of the performance cost/benefits of using BerkleyDBs and hash joins (180-3500 times). With improvements of 2-3 orders of magnitude for large sets, it would have been worth a complementary example in chapter 6 so that readers can weigh the alternatives for certain situations.The book, however, is well worth the price just for chapters 4, 5 and 9.4) Sequence Formats and Inheritance5) A Class for Restriction Enzymes9) Introduction to Bioperl"
3,Better alternatives out there,"In 1994 Monty Python had a 25th anniversary release of a boxed set (6 CD) of everything they'd done (except Live from the Hollywood Bowl, which is essentially no different from Live at Drury Lane, which *is* included). This CD is a one-CD boiled down version of this.There is no substitute for the boxed set, not even ""The Final Rip-Off."" Monty Python material is like classical music... you can't break apart the pieces and expect no leakage. Go find the boxed set in the secondary market."
5,great arrangements of jazz standards,"This book is very helpfull for the jazz guitarist who wants to learns chord melody style playing. It would have been better though if the standard chord changes would have been printed above the chord symbols. For beginning and intermediate players it is now, in some cases, unclear what the chord changes are unless a fake book is used alongside this book. Butt all in all very tasty stuff."
1,What comes is not what's pictured!,"I ordered a MINI-CD holder, with 4 slots in each page. What I received was a regular CD holder that holds 1 CD per side for 12 pages. What was delivered was NOT the product pictured!"
2,Late '70's bland pop music...,"By the time Al Stewart got to this album, his creative juices iced over to be replaced by this easy listening background music. This seemed to happen to many folk-based musicians around this time (Ian Matthews, Ralph McTell, etc.). Buy ""Past, Present and Future"" or ""Modern Times"" instead. Both are *well worth* the $$$."
2,Region 2 review,"wrong region. cmon, I live in the US, your shipping to the US. Common sence! I order 100's of movies and still get stiffed on ones that I don't see the region posted on. Maybe I missed it. Sorry if I did. All in All Poor expierence"
3,Pretty Good Slasher Film.,"A young man starts killing women who will have nothing to do with him. But he kills them with his clothes off. I didnot understand this, wouldn't you still get blood on your clothes when you put them on? But Bronson wants him put away, and does what ever it takes. He breaks the law, gets fired and turns vigilante."
5,Open Season 2,My grandson loves this movie and now I need to purchase 3 for him. Im so glad I can go back and forward to buy any movies I need for my family and myself....
4,Good Movie!,"Wish the voices were the same but the story line was fun for the family, we enjoy watching the 2 movies back-to-back for a family night."
2,Hoped for better story...,Doesn't compare to the original. Skip it and just enjoy the fist one. Kids wouldn't even watch it as the characters and story line were weird.
4,Essential for emergency health care providers!,"Keeping it short and sweet...this is a book that's written in a way that makes it easy to understand. Abundance of practice strips throughout the book, set in stages, makes it easy to get used to reading them. I recommend it for anyone that's going to be in the emergency setting. If I had to come up with a negative, the answers in the back on the strips that you read aren't always as accurate in measurement as they should be so don't beat yourself up too bad if you don't come up with exactly the same answers."
3,"If your gonna write in the book, let the buyer know before you sell it.","The book itself was great, I didn't mind that the flash cards were in a plastic zip loc baggie. The thing I did mind was that all the answers were written into the end of chapter exercises, a lot of them were wrong answers. This made it harder to study and quiz myself. Had I known the book was written in I would have purchased from a different seller."
2,Hate this book!,"Every sentence has a blank which makes it really annoying to read. The words for the blanks are off to the side which makes the whole concept idiotic. The first thing I did was go through and fill in all the blanks so I could read it. Once you start reading it becomes apparent that the authors copied all the facts they could find about the current subject and put them in ""bulleted"" numbered format. There are no paragraphs, the facts are repetitive, it is obvious that the ""facts"" were taken from different places.The good news(?) is that if you don't have any medical experience or know medical terminology the words and definitions are dumbed down so that anyone can understand them. If you have to have this book as a text for a class and don't care about learning any more than you have to, then go for it, it does seem to cover the very minimum basics. If you want to learn anything about the heart and how it works I'd get something else."
3,Good.,"This is a good album. I always thought there was something transcendental about some of the songs that they sing. But it's been some time.I'm probably not qualified to review this, but I will.I remember dancing to this with an old friend and little brother, and it never seemed to get old. There was always a sense of joy whenever we would sing, but I can't explain it.That's it."
2,"Certain songs, not the original cassette version?","I should have listened to all the samples first before purchasing but only listened to Dial My Heart which sounded just as I remembered it when I was a kid and so I thought the rest of the tracks were the original versions based on the cassette I had. Unfortunately, this version of the album contains different versions of certain songs. I like the originals much better. Keep this in mind before deciding to buy this.I really want the original versions or whatever version is on the cassette I own."
3,All time favorite.,It was nice to hear again after all these years. The general premise behind it of growing into who are and all you can be is a good one but a wee bit hoaky.
5,Wonderful for teachers!,"I taught grade school for thirty years. My first eight years of teaching were spent teaching second grade. This album was part of my curriculum. The children absolutely loved it, and so did I! It was fun and educational. It initiated discussions of social interaction and behavior.I purchased this CD to bring back the wonderful memories of my first years of teaching. And it does just that! I still love listening to this CD!"
5,FABULOUS!!!!,"My sister bought this album for me in 1973 and as a child, I LOVED IT!!! Just this week, I bought the CD for my daughter and fell in love all over again.While the message that this recording conveys could not have been more timely in the early 70s, it is still completely relevant today. While much has changed in the past 25+ years (working moms, etc), many stereo types regarding the role of men and women still exist. The recording does a beautiful job of reminding adults and children alike that you can do WHAT EVER you want to do and it OK!!!! Not to mention, the music is GREAT (I still sign along to every song)Its a childrens recording that adults will LOVE as well!!!"
4,Free to be You and Me,"Bought the album just to get a copy of the title song. Wife wanted it, got it, and liked it. It sold for a very reasonable price as well."
5,Much more than a collection of songs and stories,Free to be you and me will always remain my favorite album/book of all time. I can remember reading and singing along to the music for hours at a time. The lessons and truths contained in Free to be you and me are universal and apply to everyone's life. Every child should have the privilage to experience what Free to be you and me has to offer and learn about what individualism is about.
5,For kids of all ages,"My daughter loved this CD when she was 3 and still loves it now that she is 10. It's a great tool for teaching kids that they are okay just being themselves. I have given this CD as a gift to several children/families, especially those who have a rather self-conscious or socially anxious child. Classic."
1,underconstruction,I thought the preachy quality of this dvd was nauseating. Someone recommended it to me for my children based on her memories of childhood. I think if she listened to it today she would find it dated and comical (if not pathetic).
2,Good for the Parents maybe.. but not the kids,This CD was a little old for my son. He prefers more of the nursery rhymes. Good quality but just not for us.
4,"I Am The Blues, Indeed","Reader of this space will, probably, already be familiar with the name of Willie Dixon if one is the slightest bit familiar with Chicago blues, Chess Records, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf or even The Rolling Stones' cover of his ""Little Red Rooster"". In this one hour presentation you get a very quick overview of his major songs, his take on the ups and downs of the blues as a genre and his performance of a number of his classics written while at Chess and at other venues. Outstanding is his classic ""I've Got The Blues"" and the song that Koko Taylor and Howlin' Wolf made famous, ""Wang Dang Doodle"". This is a serious piece of blues, especially Chicago blues, history by a man at, or near, the center of it in its hey day as he nears the end of his own career (1984)."
3,Good Performance. Bad editing,"Good concert performance by Willie. Yes, he is closer to the end of his career here than to his prime, but he still performs with energy and enthusiasm and is in great voice. Mainly sings; only plays bass on one song. Nice to see him playing with Baby Doo, his old partner from The Big Three. I agree that the concert is pretty short. My main gripe is the editing. There are a number of cuts to interviews in the middle of songs or immediately after a song, which destroys the flow of the set. It would have been better to have grouped the interview footage together at the end or as part of the bonus features, rather than break up the concert. It is particularly bad when they cut away mid-song."
3,"Useful, but not perfect","Like other reviewers, I found this remote to be helpful, but not ""universal."" The original remotes are still needed for some functions. It is helpful in that it will turn on/off individual devices, but some functions of the original remote are not obvious on the universal. The ""Event"" concept sounds good, but it does not always work as expected. I find it easier to use the universal remote to turn on/off the devices individualy. I don't always want to watch a movie with sound coming through the receiver. I won't return it, but after using it, I probably would not buy it again."
5,Best Investment,I would buy 10 of these if needed. It is very easy to use and to program. I got rid of 10 remotes with this. I even control my AC and Fans. The 1 button functions are great and make quick work of watching TV. I believe everyone should have a version of this remote.
2,"Decent remote, but does not last","I bought this remote several years ago for almost $100 and figured for that price, it would work and last for more than a couple years. While it did work adequately for most functions, there were a few glitches. For example, the tivo controls (FF, RW, etc) were not as quick to respond as the Tivo remote itself. The real problem came when after 2 years several of the buttons used on a regular basis stopped working. In contrast, the FREE remote that came with the Tivo still works flawlessly after years of use. I love the idea of a universal remote, but beware that spending $100+ for a remote does guarantee that it will work."
5,Remotes don't get any better than the Harmony series,"If you don't mind setting up your remote via your computer then a Harmony remote is what you need. I recommend them to everyone. These remotes will really let you put away all of your other remotes. You can test drive the setup procedures on Logitech's website to see if this is your cup of tea.All Harmony remotes have the same programmable capabilities, so you should make your decision based on the buttons available, price, and other features. The only thing that I wish this model had was rechargeable batteries because the batteries need to be changed about every month."
5,Works perfect! Much easier to use than other remotes!,"My husband asked for one of these for Christmas after doing his own research. It took a little bit to get it set up, but once working, he loved it!! So much, he bought one for me after Christmas. Using this remote is so much easier than any other remotes I have used. Many one click buttons, makes it easier to watch movies or use the DVR button. I wish the GLOW button stayed lit longer, and that the buttons were easier to view. I was disappointed that the price increased in just a weeks time, but that is the vendor, not the product. I have to find glasses to view. Otherwise, no complaints and would recommend to anyone wanting to use an easy one remote. As long as you are tech savy, no problems on getting it set up. My husband could figure it out, but I could not."
1,Feels like junk compared to other Harmonys,"I have owned and used several harmony remotes.. the 880, 550, and Xbox remote. I liked all of them except the 670. It really feels like junk compared to the others. One of the top buttons would get stuck when pressed. The overall feel of it was very poor and the buttons were not comfortable to me.I do like the harmony line of remotes in general. My personal favorite is the 550, or xbox 360 model if you have an xbox 360."
1,Stay AWAY from this control,"After spending $100 on this remote, I haven't used it once! This is a battery monster. I put in the batteries that came with the remote, and it immediately started blinking 'low battery'. Then I put in fresh batteries I had in the house: Same Message! I then bought NEW ULTRA batteries, which lasted for less than 6 hours and then started with the Low Battery message! It's ridiculous. Even the manual says that expected battery life is 2-3 weeks.. for a remote control? I would expect 2-3 Months!Messages to customer support, as always, were never answered.STAY AWAY FROM THIS CONTROL !"
3,currently unsupported,"It's not the remote that is the problem it is Logitech's service. It worked fine until we changed some equipment and update it. That's when we found out that Logitech's newest software, that we had no choice but to download, didn't support this device. To do anything is going to require a paid phone call to Logitech to see if they can fix it. Shame on them!"
5,Harmony 670,"Once the realization hit that this device, while excellent, can't think for itself, we were very happy with it. It depends on the components it controls being synchronized, so they all turn on at once etc...so if one component is turned on manually by a foolish meddler the synchronization is destroyed. The remote's help feature is then used to restore status quo ante.Setup software was well designed and easy to use. It is a great boon to the Luddites in our house who are generally helpless when it's time to switch a TV input. Just remember - once you have the remote use it and it alone to control your devices!"
4,"Now 5 yrs old, still working great.","I originally rated the remote 2 stars because it stopped working reliably at 12 months - it would shut itself off frequently. Instead of tossing it, I took it apart and examined it with a strong magnifying glass. I found tiny slivers of metal inside, some were wedged between the pins of the integrated circuits. Once I removed them with a needle and can of compressed air, the remote started working reliably again. The remote is now 5 yrs old, has been heavily used enough so that much of the paint on the bottom is worn off. But it is still as reliable as it was after I cleaned it.I wish the software offered finer control over the infrared signaling, but it has been able control my 5 devices just fine - cable box, projector, dvd player, AVR, X10 light controller."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We were looking for a universal remote - sounds easy right? WRONG!!! WE have satellite, TV, DVD and surround sound. We didn't think they made anything that would help us. Our oldest son recommended this to us and it has to be the greatest invention since sliced bread!!! No more looking for 3 remotes and only finding 2 or only just one. This was easy to setup and very easy to use and it controls EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Love it,"Bought this particular remote for the backlit buttons, which other models do not have. Initially it did not switch to the right channel on my old TV when using the ""Watch DVD"" button, but using the Help button on the remote it fixed the problem easily. The web-based software is easy to use - yes it does take time if you want to tweak the buttons to you exact specifications, but this is to be expected. Overall zero complaints!"
5,Fantastic Remote,"This remote has replaced my remotes for 5 separate devices. It even offered better functionality than the original remotes, and organized them into nice logical groups. The button layout is a little odd at first, but overall it is a great value. I goofed when I set the device up initially by overthinking the process. I called Logitech customer support, and it was amazing. This is a really nice item."
5,"Easy, powerful, does what it promises","I recently upgraded from a Sony AV-3000, and the experience of the Logitech Harmony 670 was a delight. The Sony wasted hours of my time with its obscure user interface, while the Logitech software just worked.Our system includes a Replay TV box, which was at the distance limits of other remote controllers, but the Logitech controls it fine, and programming the Harmony's keys for the functionality of the Replay went smoothly.The on/off state memory of the Harmony solved the problem of controlling devices never designed to work in a system. It would be great if the device manufacturers had programming functionality that comprehended their devices would work in a system, and made them easy to control. But I guess achieving world peace would be easier than getting good user interfaces from the consumer electronics manufacturers...This is a terrific device!"
1,Lot of shortcomings,"1) No set-up for Blu-ray2) No DVR button3) Buttons are too glossy, impossible to read4) LCD is dim and hard to read.I almost never return products but this is going back today."
1,Don't buy this - the usb connector breaks off,"I bought one and 6 months later the USB connector broke off inside. They replaced it under warranty. 6 months later it happened again, They would not replace - offered me half off anything on there website which gets this remote down to the amazon price. I'm not going to buy another. Now the screen is blank. Will someone out there build a better remote. This thing works good except it is poorly manufactured. Don't buy this."
1,Light up features die easily,"We had the Logitech 670 for about 2 weeks and then the light up screen lost most of its pixels. We had to contact Logitech directly because when we tried to re-download, the pixels still did not return. Logitech was very accomodating and tried a few different corrections from the computer to the remote but the pixels would not return. They sent a new remote within 10 days. The new remote was just received and we are hoping the pixels stay put and do not disappear in 2 weeks."
1,"Save your money, its a tickiing time bomb","I bought this because of the price: $39.99. It worked great, except for a few minor problems. The system never really could turn on and off everything it was supposed to.After 3 months, it just quit working. Don't buy the refurbed models. They are junk!"
2,"Great functionality, but too fragile","First let me say that I love Harmony Remotes. They are great products in terms of functionality. Unfortunately the I've owned two 670's, both of which broke in the same way. The USB connector and IR light in the front became detached from the device. The thing is just not durable. Sure, it has been dropped or knocked off of the coffee table a couple of times, but the darn things are just too fragile. I believe the fact that I experienced the exact same issue on each of my remotes is proof of this fragility. I'm going to give Logitech one more try with the Harmony One. We'll see if the build quality is any better."
2,Kaput,"Worked well, easy to set up. Purchased in July, 2007, in March 2010 the screen went blank and I have not been able to fix it. Still can use remote to turn on/off the TV and cable box, but without the use of the screen I cannot record programs off the cable box, watch movies (DVD)or listen to music(CD). For the cost of the remote it should last more that two plus years."
3,Not for the long run . . .,"I loved the look of this watch and wore it 24/7 swimming, playing tennis, diving, etc. It spent many hours every week in some kind of water Was great for about six months but then began to fog up. Sent it to be fixed, worked well for another few months then fog again, finally just gave up on it not even two years after I bought it."
2,"Great features, poor quality","I bought this watch brand new from a large military/police supply site online and loved it for 10 months. Then for no apparent reason, the second hand fell off. It lodged in the minute hand and stopped it. I went on Luminox site and found that they wont even fix a watch of theirs unless you prove it came from an ""authorized distributor"", which I found out to my dismay the site I bought it from is not (of course they dont tell you that when you buy it). So if Luminox wont stand behind their own products bought brand new in box, they must know that they are garbage...Who doesnt stand behind their products anymore? Wow"
2,CHEAP PLASTIC WATCH,"My model 3001 just broke for the 3rd time. The first two times it just quit and they fixed it under warranty. Now that I'm out of warranty, the stem will not go back in. I was told there is NO warranty on the stem, even if it was new. They will fix it for $95 - it's $165 new.It will still keep time, but is no longer waterproof. I don't think I'll throw away any more money on this watch and I won't buy another one."
2,Too expensive for a throw-away watch,"I bought the watch for recreational diving, and it has served that function well. I like the tritium glow for night dives. The glow does fade and fail after a handful of years, and ""Luminox Watch Repair"" charges about $170 to renew the tritium (glow). Amazon sells the watch new for $199. After sending my watch in for repair, it took Luminox about 2 months to get back to me with the price to replace the tritium. Luminox included a marketing ploy with their repair quote. Luminox offered an ""extended discount"".... 25% off of a new watch. Problem is, their ""extended discount"" is $263.95, which is $64.95 (33%) higher than Amazon's everyday price.Never again Luminox."
2,Customer Servcie,"After about three years the watch died. Fair enough, it needed a new battery. The Luminox website states that it needs to be send back to Luminox for a new battery. So I printed off the pdf form the Luminox website, but had a simple question, so I emailed them. Nothing, no response. So I finally took it to a local jeweler who inserted a new battery and it now works just fine. I suppose that I now cannot send it back to Luminox, but who cares? In summary, a neat watch that is not backed up by its supplier."
2,NOt near the quality you are paying for.,"Like others I have read here, I found the quality to be substandard for the price. I also found the company service to be horrid and arrogant. The band broke nearly right away and the pins come out of the softer polymer lugs. I like the look but would not and have not purchased another again."
5,Huge fan of Luminox,"I have several Luminox watches and they are all great. This is the original. It is very light (the description here says that the case is steel, but I don't think so: it is hard plastic). The watch is very nice and durable. I am totally happy with mine. They are really great watches, very bright at night (unlike most watches). I highly recommend this watch, especially at the price listed. The only minor thing is that the thing that you set the time with is not screw-down, which ""purists"" don't like. The watch is very accurate."
4,HOT HOT HOT,"I could not put this book down. As a matter of fact i'm on this site to see if T. Hitman has writtin anything else. The setting of a baseball team where men or men was a great idea. Some of the men have never had gay sex before and actually most start off straight, and they all find out about HOT gay sex. Of couse the sex is hot, but their really really is a really good story behind it all. The sex is explained in such detail, you feel like you're in the room watching.You also cheer the hero's on.Great Read, for what it is, an Gay Erotic novel."
2,Good [Activity] ...Little Else,"The reason that this book only deserves two stars is because of the blown potential. If this book was written right, it could have come accorss as smoldering ..., but because of ..no plot, it just comes off as forgettable. This book follows a 40 year old baseball player as he, well, [interacts] with almost every member of his baseball team. The ...scenes are hot and very descriptive. The problem is that the characters in the book are so underdeveloped that it is hard to pictue what is going on. ...The only thing that keeps this novel from getting one star is that the author knows how to write a good ... scene- but after you have read through this novel a second time, you'll wish you'd never bought it. ..."
2,Good information poorly organized,"Sorry, I wanted so badly for this to be a good book, but it's highly flawed.Although it contains some very good information, it is poorly organized for someone who would like to learn the Indian Tabla drums.I tried to take lessons, but they were too expensive. I was hoping that my few lessons combined with a good DVD book would get me started, but this isn't it.The problem is that the material is not presented from the viewpoint of someone who is just learning. The examples are played WAY too fast, there is too much talking at the beginning, much of it not even related to playing, and not enough slow, how-to stuff. She's a great player, just not good at showing how to learn. This might be a good book for someone who already plays and wants to get new viewpoints on performing, but I would not recommend it for a beginner."
1,not very useful and vendor charges 15% restocking. BUYER BEWARE,"Most Weber grills come with an LP tank with a quick release collar on the tank. This product requires a threaded collar, so it is basically worthless. But, Hometown Hearth and Grill a.k.a. Suburban Propane charges a 15% restocking fee. This fee is not disclosed at all during the time of purchase. Don't use this vendor"
1,Not enough heat (same as the others),"I have had the same problems as those who comment below with this adapter hose. I can't grill using the adapter hose because there is not enough gas flowing to the grill. One day the hose would not work and I had an extra small blue tank (portable tank) and hooked that up and it worked fine (so its probably not the cold weather). Something is wrong with the hose. . . review below mentions waiting 60 seconds to turn the gas on the grill. I will go try that now and see if that works if it doesn't then don't waste your money on something that you can't use.EDIT:Used the directions below, and that seemed to make the hose work normally, I'll change my rating to 4 stars."
2,Beware sharp edges and corners,"These blocks are beautiful to look at. But dangerous for small hands. They are fresh off the cutting block. No finishing touches to smoothen the edges and corners. Had to use fine sandpaper to smoothen edges myself. Easy to do, but very time consuming. For the price of these blocks, you shouldn't have to put in the extra time and money to make them safe for kids."
1,Dangerous,"I bought these as a gift, and recently learned that the child got a splinter from them, playing with them on the first day. These may be cute as decor, but use caution when your children play with them."
3,Nice design but sharp edges,I like the embossed designs on these blocks so really wanted to like them due to other great reviews. Returned it because the corners are pointed and sharp - it could be dangerous if the kids fall on these or a little painful if someone steps on the corners. They were smaller than expected.
5,Don't know who likes them more - my son or my husband...,"I didn't want to get my son the same old every day blocks that I have seen - sorry they look boring. So I was glad when I found these online. They are a little more expensive but well worth it. The carving on each block is beautiful, the colors are saturated and do not peel off, and each block has letters, numbers, and picture of an animal. My son loves to stack them up to make towers and so does my husband! They play a game where my husband stacks them and my son runs up and knocks them down. They are blocks so the corners are sharp but if there is a block out there with rounded edges I haven't heard of it or seen it. Absolutely gorgeous!"
4,Very nice blocks.,"These are my son's first set of blocks. They are very well made, light, and the engraving is really detailed. We'll probably keep these even after he grows out of them because they re so nice."
4,Works pretty well for me,Tool works as described. I am sure there are more expensive versions but this works for me. Nice sharp chains when done.
3,Basic social dance,"Basic Cultural social dance. Only one or a couple of moves shown by non dance teachers for each dance style. The cover says they are professional dance teachers but they are only what I can call social dancers who maybe teach their friends. Social dancers yes, dance teachers, no.The Tejano Polka, Waltz, Cumbia.The base step for the Balada is an important step for South American's to learn.I enjoyed the video but must say it is very limited in what it teaches."
2,"Stale, stale, stale",Ugh. I love Cadbury Flake bars but these were stale and disgustingly old. Chocolate had bloomed and I was unable to eat the lot. Bah humbug.
3,Half stale candy.,"If you read the reviews of different sellers of this product on Amazon, you will find that many customers are complaining about the same thing. Old (possibly out of date) Flake candy with dual Arabic and English labeling. I would not purchase Fake from any seller on Amazon unless they were to state in their description that the candy was fresh. My order was not inedible, but the quality was definitely compromised."
4,love it!,So happy to have these little guys! 4stars only cuz they were a little melty by the time they got to south florida.
2,"I loved the product, but it was broken in tiny pieces when it arrived.","The product was great, but after being shipped it had broken into tiny bits, so the texture which is key to the product was lost."
2,"Intriguing premise, but weak storytelling","While I read and enjoyed Dunn's ""Days of Cain,"" this book shares a weakness of that novel, although it is more prevalent here.The ideas in ""Full Tide.."" are interesting, and the concept original, but the characters seem little more than mouthpieces for various political and idealogical points of view, and the plot moves at a sluggish pace.While I'm not advocating a book full of bone-crunching action, I did want a novel where I cared about the people in the story, and what happened to them.In ""Days of Cain"" I felt the emotion of the situation. Here, I didn't feel I got inside the characters heads or feelings enough.Not recommended."
2,ahmad jamal live,"Having heard him live, and owning his LP's and CD's I wanted this DVD.I was very disappointed! The video was very poor (1/5), and the audio is mediocre (1/5)! Even if you like Jamal, do not buy this dvd!"
4,Ahmad Jamal,Good concert by the great Ahmad Jamal. I'm pretty mystified by the negative reviews. Worth having.
2,Uninspiring,This movie makes an ineresting subject about hitmen and assisinations very very stupid with idiotic plots and scenes put in.
1,U.S Capitol Building Puzz 3D,Very poor directions to assemble this puzzle. Never really got it together after hours and hours of trying.
5,BAD BOY,"I remember losing a woman to a guy singing Ray Parker's 'Bad Boy'. So, yeah, it's got meaning for me. And it's a little song about masochism for all of you who don't know. This guy could put together some really interesting songs. Jack and Jill, You Can't Change That and Ghostbusters. A Woman Needs Love. What a writer. As I recall, at one point, he was a session guitarist. Play on."
5,Doing It For Herself in The 80's,"After getting back on track thanks to Arista Records, and 1982's dance and Soul Hit, Jump To It. Aretha took it up a notch with this record.Freeway of Love became one of her biggest hits ever, and many thought her biggest hits were left in years past. Another Night and Who's Zooming Who are also great 80's Soul/Pop classics, and the bluesy Sweet Bitter Love was song that Re Re recorded many years ago for Columbia, and this song was a great in your face answer to anyone who thought that he 80's work was not mature enough.The Regae sway of Ain't Nobody Ever loved You, and her duet with Annie Lenoxx, Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves, round out this release nicely.Drop the top baby and lets cruise!"
5,"the best shampoo, but hard to find","This is my favorite shampoo, (I have dry hair) but it is very difficult to find. The added advantage of pepermint smell - which I find relaxing."
1,Goes on a long time,"I really hated the title character in this. Maybe I'm just not the target audience, but I thought it was awful and pretentious.Dominic Monaghan was fine as a hedonistic musician, and Ally Sheedy played nicely against her image as the manager. I can't remember the rest, I disliked it so much."
2,waste of time,I got this movie because Jason Behr was in it.I guess everyone needs to make a living but I wasted my money. There really isn't a storyline. Just a jumble.I was very disappointed
2,Fun but...what?,"Like most puzzles of this sort, this was fun to put together. I enjoyed it very much. The thing is though, the final model looks very silly. It is called a Spinosaurus but the dinosaur that went by that name looked very much different. This guy turns out looking like a deformed T-Rex with some very goofy looking arms. As for quality, the of wood peel apart very easily (as one might expect from such a cheap toy) and the puzzle has pieces that will not stay together right without glue. You could assemble this guy and not glue him but then all you'll have in the end it a strange looking deformed T-Rex with some droopy ribs and crazy arms.That being said, it was fun to assemble and it is cheap. Just don't buy it until you've googled a Spinosaurus and decide you don't care."
2,Rubber grip comes off,The rubber gripping that surrounds the edge of the bowl comes off very easily and is extremely difficult to put back on. Therefore making the bowl very easy for the puppy to push around.
5,the crown jewel,"After countless hits,metal glam classics and rebel raisin'rock, this group of rousers suddenly grew-up and retreated to the hills to record this classic. An album made by mature musicians who were just to good to put out another 1,4,5 boogie album. This has an adventurous feel to it like a classic Queen album. Some moments do sound like Queen in the complex harmonies. And the softer songs have a grand orchestral sound that is big not boring.And we have our heavy guitar themes but the glossy production makes everything sugary sweet. I'm reviewing this again after all these years because we the fans were unfair when this came-out the first time. ""Love Is Like Oxygen"" did go on to be a big hit. This is a deep album and deserves reflection and multiple spins...5 stars because this is a class A record from a band that just became a class act at that time..."
4,from glam-rock to renaissance !,"This is their last album with singer Brian Connolly and it contains the hit-single ""Love is like oxygen"". A very versatile record. First you get 70ies hard rock, then funk and then renaissance music with a lot of harpsichord ! However, this strange blend of genres really works and the entire album sounds good (""warm"") as a whole. To me it's their second best after ""Give us a wink"", which is Sweet's absolute hard rock album (with ""Fox on the run"", ""Action"",""Sweet FA"", ""The Healer"",...). Sweet always managed to find original harmonies and style combinations, and ""Level Headed"" is their last masterpiece."
1,cats love it but dangerous,"I have a one year old cat who loves this toy, but it's dangerous without close supervision. Safety release often doesn't work (true for two of the four I've bought), so ultimately the whole contraption comes off the door frame with great force after the cat runs off with the mouse or bird. The metal prongs hanging from the door jam could put out an eye of anyone within range (or conceivably the cat if he looks back when it flies off the door jam), and when the cat runs around furniture with the cord attached to the mouse it can strangle the cat if he becomes entangled in it. Has wrapped around his legs and once around his neck, which could be fatal. Use only with close supervision but get this toy corrected so all safety releases release!! I wrote to the producer (Ethical Products-ha! months ago but have rec'd no reply. CW"
1,BEWARE!,"I bought this from a local pet store. As many have said, the safety clip does NOT work! My kitten grabbed and pulled and yanked and managed to pull this thing feet away only to have it snap back. When I tried to yank and pull the string apart, even I couldn't do it!Within 28 hours of putting this up, the kitten managed to pull the bird off the bungee. I'm INCREDIBLY disappointed with this purchase. While my kitten loved it, she'll play with a crumpled up piece of paper. I'm going to find something else for her to entertain herself."
3,okay quarter but...,i mean why buy this these are so easy to find in change i mean seriously you can find this anywhere and its only 19 years old i mean gees i dunno 0.85 cents for this pretty steep if you ask me and dont mention that its circulated i give it three stars because hey why not try to make a buck on this huh? and plus that its so common i mean its like selling a 2005 D penny and thats pathetic! so buy this or just get change for a dollar and youll probaly find it thats how common this coin is
1,Still have not received,"If you want this item, be ready to wait. I haven't received it within 3 weeks and it still has not shipped. I am about to cancel my order."
2,Oyster Extract ?? yuckkk,Dont you hate the way these companies discreetly add in an animal product into an otherwise unseemingly vegan product...
4,"Great sauce, but a bit pricey","I bought a bunch of these when Amazon was running a sale. I love the basil chicken (ga kra prao) that is served at Thai restaurants and have tried to replicate it myself with no luck. I am pleased to say that the sauce included in this product replicates it perfectly.My tip is to use ground chicken rather than sliced. One sauce packet goes perfectly with 1/2 pound ground chicken. I also prefer jasmine rice rather than the included rice noodles.Which brings me to the expensive part. If you do what I do, you're basically paying for a packet of sauce. And depending on how much you eat, and how many there are of you, that could mean multiple packets per meal.Anyway, to sum up, I recommend you give it a try using ground chicken and then decide whether it's ever worth it to buy it again."
1,Totally incomplete,"Carnegie Hall has been around for 100 years and this documentary tells the story in less than one hour. Give me a break. It should be at least twice as long. There are plenty of comments from performers but not even one complete performance. And way too much time is spent on the upstairs studios. This DVD was a huge disappointment. Fortunately, I only rented it. Whatever you do, make sure you see it first before wasting over 20 dollars."
5,Manic!,"I have this and the other IMP issue containing Symphony 5. The performances are so manic and aggressive that they must be near the limits of human capacity. Yet, the playing is precise and the dynamics are perfectly judged. In all, Symphonies 1 & 5 and most of the accompanying overtures respond well to this approach. In fact, they are my favorite performances of these works and reflect what I regard as the composer's somewhat disturbed and turbulent personality as channeled into the music. I'm not so sure how well Symphonies 3 & 4 respond to this approach (assuming that's the case) because I haven't been able to get hold of that disc. Too bad these haven't been reissued or made available as a download. The sound (from 1993 in this case) is dramatic and clear if slightly less open than the best modern recordings."
2,Not very helpful for me,"I just finished the flight and oral aspects of the commercial exam. Looking back on it, this book did LITTLE to help. I referenced it a few times, but for the most part, it wasn't very helpful at all(It was very wordy and confusing and it doesnt give you the ""why"").I would only buy this book if you can get it for cheap. Otherwise, use the FAR/AIM, airplane flying handbook, and the Jeppeson Commercial/instrument book. The Jeppeson book was by far the most valuable and informational."
2,"This book should have been called ""Understanding COM"".","This book gives you the basics to get you started with COM, but as far as DCOM is concerned it barely covers the basics. For example, it fails to mention you need a #define _WIN32_DCOM in your clients StdAfx.h file in order to be able to call CoCreateInstanceEx(). Only one chapter is devoted to distributing COM classes, and it is only 15 pages long."
2,"Full of errors and ""look elsewhere for answers""","It's a nice introduction to COM/DCOM. The authors go over the basics, over and over and over again. Then they lead you through several simple examples.You get a step-by-step overview to very elementary COM/DCOM concepts.You will find phrases such as ""if you want more information, buy a book on OLE/automation."" That's what I thought I bought *this* book for! Too much goes unexplained, waved away with a magic wand. Many of the examples don't compile (the authors tell you to build a project without MFC and then use MFC classes within it).Recommendation: If you have trouble getting started with COM/DCOM, this will help. Expect to obtain more materials to actually understand what's happening and how to do it."
4,Good reading,Saw this was a Mac Donald book...3 in one. Did not check who the editor was. While waiting for its arrival I was skeptical. While the editing was less than perfect...the story was not! Great story...glad I bought this book.
1,Cheap,"Buy a more expensive cutter!!! You defiantly get what you pay for. I started to use it when making a quilt and it began to fall apart almost from the start, the screw that holds the blade in is attached to the safety (or not so safe) guard and the screw begins to loosen with every roll of the blade. By about 3 cuts I am tightening this screw and if you tighten it to much the blade doesn't move but then the blade is loose and making crazy lines. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Nice Sturdy cutter,"I find these cutters to be very easy to use, I find them safe to use and an overall good buy. I used them for the first time to cut out a pattern for a skirt.It glided over the pattern and material so smoothly I was hooked. No more bending over for what seemed like forever to cut with a pair of dull scissors. I have been using them for a good amount of time and have not had to change the blade yet is is very sharp."
5,Good Cutter,This is a good medium size cutter for the right price. The handle is very comfortable to work with for extended periods of time.
2,Not handy,"I used to have a rotary cutter that had a guard that was spring-loaded so the blade only came out when I pressed down to cut. That way I could slide the cutter sideways up to the ruler edge and cut. The blade on this one is always exposed and I have to carefully position it. It takes more time and I nick it on the ruler edge frequently. It has a comfortable handle, but that doesn't outweigh the drawbacks for me."
4,great!,This rotary cutter is great. I used it to cut burlap to make a bunch of buntings. It worked well. I loved that the blade was retractable. One slight issue was that I would sometimes accidentally push the button that retracted the blade while I was cutting. I'm not exactly sure why they places the button where they did but I can't really complain because this was the cheapest I found this exact cutter. It worked perfectly for what I needed though.
5,Love this! Perfect for fabric cutting!,"This is a pretty good quality rotary cutter. I have to roll over the fabric a couple times before it slices the fabric, but that's expected with rotary cutters. It's good quality and easy to maneuver with. I recommend the buy."
2,Not so good,They are very hard to manuver around corners and you have to push very hard to get them to cut.
4,A cheap but good cutter,"This rotary cutter is less expensive than many others on Amazon, but I've found it to work very well. Smooth operation and the blade came very sharp (after months of use, I have noticed that the blade is much duller, but that's to be expected).One small complaint is that the safety-release button (that pops the blade back under the safety when you push it) is like a hair-trigger: you barely have to touch it for it to activate. It's located on the side of the cutter, so many times when I am cutting something, my finger will inadvertently brush it and send the blade back under its plastic cutter. This ends up not being a big deal."
2,Not for fabric,"I bought this to cut fabric for quilting but it didn't work out so well. I bought a cutting mat and everything, but I still had to press really hard to cut the fabric and it made it hard to cut accurately. I went back to scissors for cutting fabric. I started using it for cutting paper for scrapbooking and stuff and it works well for that! I guess I'll try a better brand like Olfa or a higher end Fiskars for fabric."
3,Tight,"This cover is a tight fit over the grill, which can be nice, but not when you get your finger caught."
4,The good ole days of Dance Pop,"I was so pleased to find this CD in a sale bin for $.99. I didn't think it was ever made on CD and here it is. I still think they were and still are prime examples of how good pop can be. This CD is great, I always wondered what happen to the original release of this album. My sister had the original and the vocals on ""Point of No Return"" were by a woman that I believe left the band before it hit big so they rerecorded it. I would love to have it just for fun. Get this CD it is good ole pop at it's best."
2,This book is a joke,"I don't believe my college actually uses this as a text. Considering all my other criminal justice/administration of justice classes hasn't really used a text I was hesitant to buy this. My professor assured us that we'd need this book so I bought it and expedited the shipping. I opened up the book and within the first paragraph it cites Wikipedia. Honestly, the author, Ronald Hunter is a joke. I can't even believe an editor approved it. Right after that I stopped reading it. I wish I read it because my first test was all about the book and I'm pretty sure I bombed it. My professor doesn't even really teach, he showed us an episode of Andy Griffith as a lesson. I guess I'll be reading this useless book for the rest of the semester, at least it's almost midterms."
1,Not worth the time,"This book had some interesting ideas and situations in it, but the author never bothered to bring closure to any of it. The focus shifts bewilderingly from character to character without much in the way of a unifying plot to it. The final pages are a stopping point rather than an ending or resolution. It was extremely frustrating to have spent the time reading this book, only to seemingly watch the whole thing come apart by the finish and result in nothing.I won't be reading this author in the future. And I'd suggest the publisher hire better editors."
4,Take a break,"Control your armys, crush your foes, and strike fear in the eyes of those who oppose you. Then log off, brush your teeth, take a break then lunge back into the world of Sarxos. Tom Clancy really grasps the world of science fiction in his Net Force book The Deadliest Game. I would recomend this book for one and all. The mystery lover, to the action seeker, all readers can love this book many times over."
4,Explorers,"This is not a book full of technical jargon. The storyline is continuously on the move and adventurous.It is about young geniuses recruited to 'patrol' the internet through VR. I started to read one page a night, after the third night, I had to read the book. Tom Clancy has a style of dragging you into the lives of the explorers and the various characters portrayed in the book. As most of the characters have a different persona in the virtual world of a computer game( they use VR) it is fast paced, suspenseful reading with a twist at the end. I also read ""One is The Loneliest Number"" which also had me reading it in two days!!!! Definately recommended reading if you enjoy futuristic siuations that are all possible with a storyline attached. A good sized, light, easy to read novel."
3,Saint Saga #30,"Seven stories from 1955, set in Bimini, Nassau, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, The Virgin Islands and Haiti. The Jamaican story is the most interesting, containing as it does a sizeable chunk of the history of the Maroons; as to its political correctness, you'll have to judge for yourself. Johnny's initial meeting with the Saint, referred to in the conversation on the plane, was inCall for the Saint.(The cover artist for the 1960 Hodder edition, apparently under the impression the the Spanish Main is somewhere in Spain, has adorned the cover with a picture of the Saint stick-figure accompanying a flamenco dancer on a guitar.)P.S. For a list of ‚Äî and discussion of ‚Äî all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
2,Of some use for the beginner,I bought this book in the hope for movement instructions like in Yang's excellent Qigong books where arrows were added to the photographs. To keep it short I don't see the beneficial effect of avoiding 'confusing' descriptions of movements and therefore the actual link between the positions depicted in the photographs. This book is still of some use to me but only after I grasped the basic movements in a training (luckily with a Chen family member). Once these basic ideas of the various positions are somewhat clearer the book helps to recollect the steps one might not be sure of.Anyway if you plan to train with a master more then 3 times a week you will simply not have much use for the book.
5,love it,My Aunt bought this for me. I just love it. The colors are great. We are going to paint the room in light green and use the ruffles border. It is a great price for 6 pieces!!! The others are so expensive. This is very reasonable. The accesories are a great price too!!
1,troma sucks,i have this on vhs from the mid 90's and i no longer care about troma/anythinguntil all the japanese versions/english language of troma's classics are released to dvd in the usa.until then nooooo troma!!!!
1,This movie is terrible,"This is without a doubt the worst movie ever made. I can't point out a single good scene in the entire movie. Seriously, even if you like bad movies, I wouldn't ever waste my money on this one. IT'S THE WORST"
4,A close look at the way the British Royal Family dresses,"This is a documentary that shows the hows, whys, wherefores and stories behind the dresses of the women of the Windsor family. Fashion specialist Suzy Menkes is interviewed and explains most of the customs and all the large variety of things to take into account when dressing Royalty. From the Queen and Queen Mother to the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York. There are interviews with the designers and couturiers responsible for the looks as well. A very good video for anyone interested in Royalty or Fashion; or both! END"
2,Don't judge Benford by this book!,"My husband and I are both SF fans who normally read everything Benford writes. We eagerly purchased Cosm (in hardcover!) and were sorely disappointed. The ""cosm"" didn't intrigue me, and it took much too long to get into any meaningful discussion of what it might really be, while the main character dithered and agonized. Benford's normally interesting glimpses into how scientists really function dragged. Although there were some potentially interesting multi-ethnic characters, none of them came alive; maybe Benford felt uncomfortable putting himself into the skins of African-American women and Asian men. The story changed tone and character about two-thirds of the way through the book and became a rather silly suspense story/love story. This book is what Timescape could have been if Timescape hadn't been great! Hollywood can only improve on it!"
4,Great if you have an interest in wierd areas of physics,"Anybody who picked up this ""Cosm"" looking for an exciting, thrilling, story may as well throw this book away. The best way to discribe it is as a ""scientific paper stuck into a fictional setting"". Having said this I think its a very intresting read, even if you do need a degree in physics to follow some of the twists and turns of the theories throw up by some of the characters in the story. I recommend this book highly as it has some really worthwhile points to make, which is becoming rarer in science fiction. So I gave it four stars but knock off two if you have no interest in physics."
5,BEAUTIFULLY PACED HARD SF,Perhaps Benford's best--a fast academic novel with more ideas than a shelf of the usual sf. He knows the way science really is done!--and his woman character is both inventive & snappy.
2,Not enough power,"This dryer is ok if you use it over night. It doesn't work in the car, unless your driving for 8 plus hours."
1,"Self-centered, bias garbage.","Despite a warning that her book wasn't a substitute for psychological advice, and that her words were 'in-your-face', Miller's words are clearly out of frustration with her own problems with men. Instead of giving advice that is neutral and useful for men, she instead complains about things that she finds unacceptable to dating and life, this mindset is more reflective of materialistic women, thus giving the female gender a bad name, and further driving men down wrong roads to 'love'.If you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from anything Romy Miller has written. Perhaps when she grows up and acts her age (whatever that is), and understands the fact that men are human, and not something women can leech off of, then maybe people will start to take her seriously."
3,It's alright,"This book is alright. But it could be because I read so many already so there is nothing new I don't know. Bascially, in a nutshell, you should just not try to understand women, don't even try. Sounds ironic? Title says otherwise. But let them be, and continue being nice to them and you're good. Good luck."
3,Understanding Women.... by Romy Miller,"The book is very good, it has some good tips and almost every chapter goes straight to the point, although the chapters are too short. It really show me a different way of how to approach a women; I recommend it!!!"
1,Not a useful perspective,"Ask a woman what she wants, and she will tell you what is in this book- for free. However, this is not a useful perspective. If it were that simple, we would not need books on the subject. In my opinion, not a good value."
1,a misguided visit,"This video tries, but fails, to balance the guided visit of Buenos Aires with language considerations. However, the vocabulary ends up distracting from the city while the visit itself misses some important aspects of the city. For example, Recoleta is shown from the outside and we are told that ""some very important argentines"" are buried there, but without a single concrete example."
3,Not very useful for me,"Although this seemed to be a useful purchase, in the end it did not do much to help me. I found it a rather cumbersome method of learning phrases I was not going to use as it turned out. Still, it did teach me some other phrases that might come in useful one day."
3,Good info,I heard about this book from a friend. I have only perused the book but it seems to have a lot of good information. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet that's why I only gave it 3 stars.
5,Lots of great recipes for what ails you.,"I got this book for my husband for Father's Day, but I use it as much as he does! Simple to use and easy to follow, I recommend this book to anyone looking to add smoothies to their daily life."
3,Just Okay...,"Not enough good recipes. Although recipes are limited, the advice on health issues is most welcome. A nice pictorial, but not enough information/recipes for the money. Would not recommend."
1,Too Big,"The first one I received failed in two uses. The somewhat sophisticated control panel is located on the side and it is NOT sealed. If you spill any fluid onto the side and it goes into the circuitry, it can short out. Another problem is the plug recepticle is on the opposite side of the handle...may sound good, but that makes it too big for my Acura TL's coffee cup holder. Lastly, the cup lid is flimsy and doesn't secure well. This cup was a great concept that was poorly executed."
1,Problems with quality control,"I am returning a second Smart Mug in a month. The first had a defective display out of the box, the second quit heating after two uses. This is a great idea for a travel mug but the execution is sadly lacking. I had previously owned an identical mug that lasted about three years, so there seems to be some quality control and production issues."
1,a speculator's attitude to the market,"why 1 star ?the book is a speculator's attitude to the market,from the first page to the end of the book you can find the so called""inspiration""to the market only,although it is based on the Charlie Munger's ideas."
4,Maxtor DiamondMax 16,"It's good to be leary of used items, particularly used hard drives. However, having purchased this particular hard drive as a portable media drive for my laptop, in conjunction with a hard drive enclosure, I am very satisfied with the seek time and reliability of the device. Both movie and music play excellently from this drive over a USB connection."
5,PAPER MOON,"This is an excellent book. Having long been a fan of the movie, what a joy to discover the book that started it all. Addie Pray is a hilarious and charming narrator and her adventures pulled me happily along. A real treat. For anyone who likes stories of sassy girls growing up."
4,"Time Travel, Vengeful Fairies, & Other Romantic Obstacles","I almost gave it up at first with the fairy scenes and the hunky highlander, but the book revs up with Adrienne's arrival. She adapts quite well to traveling back four centuries and being forced into marriage in Scotland in 1510.The pair spar their way through a good part of the book, but finally get past that. Unfortunately the fairy interference keeps their romance from running smoothly. There are some steamy seduction scenes along the way and Adrienne gets yanked back and forth between centuries, but it all works out in the long run."
3,Good but Not as Good as The Fever Series,"If you have read the Fever Series by this author you might not like this book. The Fever Series was phenomenal--interesting, scary at times, intriguing. This is a nice love story although Kresley Cole did the ""they hate each other and then get together"" stories better. I only gave it 3 stars because I gave the Fever Series 5 stars. It's interesting to read Ms. Moning's story about how she came to write the Fever Series at the end of this."
5,WOW!,"Awesome! From the first page to the last, I couldn't put one of these books down for a minute without thinking about the characters and wanting to get right back to the stories! (My husband was thrilled with how fast I cooked supper for him while in the middle of reading one of the Highlander books.)Karen Marie Moning knows how to do it right!1. Beyond the Highland Mist2. To Tame a Highland Warrior3. The Highlander's Touch4. Kiss of the Highlander5. The Dark Highlander6. The Immortal Highlander (Not Yet Released, I am anxiously awaiting it's release.)This writer's work is a great escape from an everyday ordinary life. These books are worth the time and twice the money they are asking for them. Don't miss out, buy yours today!"
2,Read like a college writing assignment,"If you enjoy a complete lack of character development and motivation, then this book is for you. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was for the requisite sex scene, which was pretty juicy in the standard ""throbbing"" and ""heaving"" sort of way. However, if it's adventure, Scottish Highlander hunkiness (and sex), a heroine with some true gumption, a well-researched plot, AND a bit of magical time travel you seek, I highly recommend the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon."
5,The Best in Mystical Romance!!!,"I first read, ""Kiss of the Highlander,"" a few years ago, and upon completion learned that Drustan's brother would have a story, however I could never find the book in any store. Well, I figured since I couldn't find it and that book was romantic, sensual, funny, tear/heart wrenching I wanted them all, so Amazon.com being the great site it is has now provided me with all of Moning's wonderful Highland books!! Yes, I know you probably want to know more about what I thought of the book, I would like to say ""I'd hate to spoil even one detail, because that's just how great they all are!! I really cannot wait until she comes out with more because I will have those also."" I can say no more than if you haven't read them all you are missing out, you know a book is great when you can't stand to put it down and can finish it in about 3 hours!!!Keep up the great work and I look forward to more great things!!Samantha"
1,predicatable,"I loved the fever series and thought I'd try some of her other books. What a disappointment. Silly and predictable, cliche."
2,Glad I read the later novels first,"If I would have read this as the first book I would not have been impressed with Karen M. Moning. This story is aggravating, with the hero and heroine constantly fighting. The later novels are so much better. In those the main characters face an adventure together which I find much more enjoyable. There is enough aggravation and discord in reality. If I'm going to read fiction I would rather characters that enjoy their time together. I had to skip to the end of this one for it took far too long for the characters to quit fighting and enjoy the adventure. The rest of the series is great. Karen M. Moning is a talented writer. I hope she continues the Highlander series. It's the best."
2,Less and less engaging,"Carly Simon's COMING AROUND AGAIN sounded pretty good the first time (1987) I heard it, but subsequent listenings proved less and less engaging. A decade later, three songs stand out: ""All I Want Is You,"" ""Coming Around Again,"" and ""You Have To Hurt,"" the latter one of the most affecting songs I have heard Simon sing. Old fans may want COMING AROUND AGAIN anyway, but if you own no Carly Simon titles, a good first purchase would be either SPY or NO SECRETS."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Cheesy.","Houston, we've got a problem. You're a tremendously talented singer, but your choice of material is questionable at best. There are a few solid moments on her second album, which did incredibly well on the charts. The upbeat ""Love Will Save the Day"" is one of the few songs here that have any trace of soul, and ""So Emotional"" and ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" are ""so-bad-they're-good"" singles that are so catchy and hook-infested, you almost forget how vapid and shallow they really are. But after that, things go downhill. ""Didn't We Almost Have it All"" and ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"" are the vanilla-plain ballads that get Houston such a bad rap from critics, though ""Just the Lonely Talking Again"" isn't half-bad. The verdict on ""Whitney"" is a split decision: it's not a terrible album but a very safe, professional-sounding one that's cleverly packaged to ensure mass appeal and platinum sales. It's a mainstream album for a mainstream audience."
3,OK but not great,"I had just finished Shadow Ranch (one of the best games in the ND series) and Deception Island when I started on this one, so I guess I had higher expectations than this could meet. It isn't a bad game-it's just that there seems to be no real mystery. You're goal is to find a mine, not to put someone behind bars-and most of the other characters just seem to be along for the ride (including a Paris Hilton-type character.) Most of the time it seemed like I was wandering through the train finding and solving puzzles that seemed to have no (immediate) effect on anything. Overall it's not a bad game (you finally get to meet the Hardy Boys-they're not, incidentially, as cute as they're cracked up to be, and almost entirely worthless to the outcome of the game, but anyway....) just not one of the very best. Still, if you're a die-hard ND fan, (or a newbie) you're probably going to like it, more or less."
3,Just an okay game.,"I bought this game last night and downloaded it. I had to wait 3 hours for the download to finally be done. At first, I really enjoyed it. But then I got stuck. I found some game hints and played with those, but some of the things I was supposed to do, I couldn't. Like grab the gem stones, or remove the eagle picture. I was quite disappointed. I'm not sure if I want to keep ""TRYING"" to play, or give up and uninstall."
4,"Fun game, very Agatha Christie","I enjoyed this game a lot, especially since I don't enjoy the usual egoshooter fare. This one is fun to play with clues to find, puzzles to solve and interesting interactions and locations. I played it in about 3 evenings, so it's quite short, but excellent value for money.My only complaint is that it didn't run in Windows 7 64-bit. Here is the manufacturer's support site: [...] I couldn't test it on a PC with Windows 7 32-bit and so had to use my old Windows XP instead."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,I lo e this game! It was the best game i have ever played next to the secret of shadow ranch! If you dont like spooky games like the curse of blackmoor or the crystall skull this is the game for you! And even if you like spooky games this game is great! It took me 2 days to finish the game. But that was because I was playing it non stop! It is pretty short but when it ends you arent like thats it! It ends at the perfect time it has really good and cool story line and you never feel like you have nothing to do. But I should warn you this game is pretty simple! It not one of those things where you have to look at the stratgy guid all the time. I still think that it was a great game and really worth my time. I think that anyone would like it!
4,One of Their Greatest Games,"This is one of herinteractive's best games. However i finished it only 2-3 days. I think it should have lasted 1 more day (on the jr. level). Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon is great other wise. I really like it. The ending/ culprit is really shocking and the puzzles (Pipe) were really cool. So, if u like all of the other games, get this one too!!!"
4,Sue as New York city visiting nurse,"This book follows ""Sue Barton, Senior Nurse"". In this story, Sue and her best friend, Kit, move to New York city; and join the Visiting Nurse service. Sue's duties take her from the Lower East Side to Harlem. There are many vignettes, humorous and touching. Not all Sue's duties are medical. She helps a lonely Polish new mother find neighborhood friends; and she helps a kind old woman realize her dreams of travel, (Sue secretly donates the money she had saved for her own trousseau for the trip). This leads into a surprising reward for Sue herself.This was a good story. A highlight of the book was the wedding of Sue and Kit's friend, Connie, which takes place in ""The Church Around the Corner"". It is a beautiful and romantic scene. Recommended."
1,Couldn't finish it.,"Oh my word. I have only ever not been able to finish a book twice in my life -- and this was number 2. The first few chapters were ok, but when things really started cooking plot-wise, the writing style became, well, high-schoolish. I wanted to like it, so I plowed ahead. But, half-way through it, I gave up.The writing style is amateurish, and clunky. Characters act in a melodramatically, with no realism. There are patches of good writing, but these patches are quickly followed by a clunker or two.I would hope that the sequel to this book improved, but since I can't finish the first, I won't be trying the second."
2,poor construction,"I knew it was faux military surplus going in, but I didn't expect a snap to pop off and a big hole to appear in the first week of use. Given this was not just a purse--I was using it at Burning Man, but my last similar-sized actual military surplus bag lasted through years of daily use plus multiple festivals, including last year's Burn. Disappointed."
4,I like this bag,"Simple, works well, fits my iPad well.Comfortable enough on my shoulder.Could use a couple more compartments, but works ok for me.I like it!"
2,Really poor stitching,I'd send it back but that is too much bother. The stitching is awful. It is just a single very thin thread stitched around the border. It is loose in several spots even before I have used it.It also still looks like a man purse even though it is canvas with black metal fittings. probably because it flares at the bottom.So if you want a canvas man purse that is badly stitched...look no further.
3,Seems small but it isn't,"This bag is one of the favorites from those I already own(because is smallish but looks cool hehe), the reason I bought it was to carry my netbook and some college books/notebooks.So now the pros:-Good built quality for it's price-Roomier for a 12"" inch bagThe cons:-has no handle-the strap is way too thin, which make feel anything you're carrying more heavy-the compartment for pencils and stuff is too smallShould you buy this? Only if you'll carry light weight stuff, a netbook, couple of books or so."
4,Super sturdy!,"I've had this bag for a year or so now and use it to hold all of my stuff while I bike to work. I ended up cutting the back and removing the cardboard piece and use it as an extra pocket. This bag isn't waterproof, but it does a decent job in the rain. I'll usually just end up tying a plastic bag that I keep in the bag for rainy days around it to keep my stuff dry."
3,king kong vs. godzilla (good times),for a good times tv version of the original film it is ok it could have been better if they also had the widescreen or letterbox version also if they had both the u.s version where king kong wins and the Japonese edition that shows godzilla winning the fight. this is actualy the third godzilla.Godzilla returns is the second godzilla(godzilla vs. giagantis the fire monster )Rodan was the predasesor of all the godzilla's you see Rodan in the destroy all monsters movie.
3,What more need say of this corny movie,Godzilla vs King Kong most of the movie is rather lame the men in suits is corny but its fun to watch once you get past those limits of this movie.
5,Monster Man,I loved King Kong and Godzilla on VHS. As cheesy as it is its still great. I would love it if they remede this one. But not from the people who remade Godzilla with Mathew Broderick. That was awful and WAS NOT Godzilla. It looked like a giant eguana.
2,My husband's favorite,My husband loves the old Godzilla movies. I got this DVD for his birthday. Sorry to say I didn't enjoy it. He did though and that's just my opinion.
3,Utter Crap...Depends On Your Taste,"just to be buying this you'd obviously be a fan, such as myself, and don't get me wrong, but this is the heavily cut down American version, which i despise. I much prefer the Japanese uncut edition on Region 2 DVD which is w/o the terrible dubbing, stock music, yes, every inch of Akira Ifukube's masterful score is shredded in this version and naturally it is re-mastered beautifully. This honestly for beginners, or better yet for those who simply wish to own both versions."
5,One of the best of the genre!!,"This film is a beloved childhood favorite of mine so it may be difficult for me to look at it through those eyes but I will give it a try.Even in its dubbed form and missing most of its beautiful original soundtrack it still has mantained its charm. The story is simple enough to follow with beautiful scenery and delightful actors but it is the performance of the monsters that really sells the show for me. The only thing missing from this dvd is the original Japanese version. I enjoy watching one version and then watching the other or comparing scenes.If you enjoy giant monster fare then look no further. If you enjoy badly dubbed Japanese films, your search is over. If you want to watch something with your family that wont offend anyone and still give you a thrill then I highly recommend this feature.Enjoy!"
5,My son's latest thrill..........,My son loves it. The movie came quickly and my son was very happy with the quality. So we are all happy.
5,King Kong vs. Godilla,The kids loved the movie...it was a classic...they liked its because it was entertaining ...we have movie night every Friday and I like for them to watch a little action but good....
2,Goofy movie,This movie was laughable. King Kong looked like a stuffed animal and him getting stronger from electricity was ridiculous. The fight scenes were funny. I wouldn't recommend this movie if you want to see a Godzilla movie with good special effects.
4,Godzilla vs King Kong: Rematch,"This movie is cheezy as heck, but hey it's a classic that I loved as a child.It's still a cool flick. What I want to see is a rematch between these 2. With modern movie making technology they are guaranteed a hit. The names Godzilla and KingKong alone will guarantee a box office payday for any studio."
3,Not the worst but better than many,THE CLASH OF THE TITANS! GODZILLA VS. KING KONG! HELLO! THE GREATEST MONSTER EVER IN THE BATTLE FOR THE CENTRY!. There is bad dubbing and the effects are horrible. You can see when Godzilla or King kong is upclose to a person that person looks bluish. i dont know why......
5,Ultimate fusion,"There are so many reasons why I love and adore this woman: Maybe it's because any CD of her, is an ultimate experience of ""Fusion"": She sings in English, French, Spanish and Arab, her music is a wonderful blend of Flamenco, Latin, House and Arab music. Los Ni√±os de Sara, being three fabulous Spanish Flamenco guitarists and a very good singer, are intervowen perfectly to Alabina's singing which is mainly in Arabic. A lot of the times she again is accompanied by a fantastic sounding Arab orchestra, with wicked darabuka drums and beats. And yes, there's even another reason, why she's so damn good: Her music is the very best against bad moods and against the misery of a boring rainy Sunday afternoon. Put her on, loud, hear the Latin beats, the Guitars and her beautiful singing and you just get up and dance away your depressions! Honest!"
1,The Best 100 ? Where ?,"Sorry , but if you want to do a book called FIFA 100 , you must put there the Best 100 players ever , and not a put togheter to satisfy international market.How can Brasil have only 14 players..and ...France 13 ....Italy 13....this is not right....Crazyyyy People who think this way.You have to be kidding......Garrincha....Zizinho...Didi ....Gerson...out....Nakata , the Korena....in....pleaseeee.....that really makes me laugh.......Helooooo? Brasil a 5 times World Champion ...Penta Campeao.....And not just that but who did this book was not Pele.....and yes..it was Blatter, using the imature Edson , because Pele would not do that....and got to Brasil...saying Iam sorry...the List was already done...I just selected a few players......Sorry FIFA ....you stink"
1,I would not buy this firewire hub,"I purchased this firewire hub thinking that I would improve the speed at which I can retrieve files on my home studio and I was WRONG!! Compared to just hooking up my external peripherals via USB 2.0, this hub doesn't help improve the speed at which I am able to get data, its RIDICULOUS!!! I am extremely dissapointed with this product and it has failed me big time. Do I need to go out and buy a more expensive firewire hub, to get my desired results? I hope not, but at this rate I might have to."
1,JUNK,THIS IS VERY CHEAP STONEWARE. IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE OLD CORNING WARE. IT CRACKED THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. I DIDN'T HIT OR DROP IT. IT JUST CRACKED BECAUSE OF INHERENT FLAWS. I WILL NEVER BUY NEW CORNING WARE AGAIN.
3,And Then You Got Amnesia.......... Or What The Hell Happened?,"I bought this book when it first came out as the book and The Journey 2cd set together in a boxset. Of course the cd's were fine, but then I read the book.... and when I was done I felt as if Donna suffered amnesia immediately after signing the contract to write this book. There really isn't much more for me to say that other reviewers haven't already said. HUGE, HUGE blocks of information regarding her career are missing and this book ends up reading like one of those cheap 5 page booklets you can pick up at the grocery checkout line along with HOW TOMATOES CAN HELP YOU LOSE 100 POUNDS!, etc. Donna, I'd like a refund please."
1,Stick To Singing Donna,"I like Donna Summer. She has a good voice and seems like a decent lady, but this book is boring at best. For someone who has been in show biz as along as she has, I expected more from her. Granted it was refreshing to read a celeb book not drowning in self pity or immoral escapades, but there is just so much a person would want to know about Donna and this book does not satisfy."
5,"Graet story, greater characters.","This book is only marginally in the Vorkosigan Saga, but this does not make it a minor book by Bujold. The story is breath-taking, as are all Bujold stories. But the depth of some characters (Leo Graf in particular) is maybe even better here. Bujold's remarkable humanism, which is a constant throughout her work (Ethan of Athos, Mountains of Mourning, etc.) is here at its best."
2,Weakest novel in the Miles Vorkosigan universe,"This novel is set in same universe as the Miles Vorkosigan series, but about 200 years before the birth of Miles, so connected very loosely to the main series. Main character Leo Graf is an engineer who is assigned to the quaddie project - quaddies being bioengineered humanoid workers who are specialized in freefall work because they have 4 arms rather than 2 arms and 2 legs. I've become a Bujold fan after reading a handful of Miles Vorkosigan novels, but this is by far the weakest novel I've read by the author. The plot is very thin and extremely predictable, the characters are flat, and if not for Bujold's talent in keeping the story moving and the dialogue lively, I would have ditched this book after 100 pages."
2,only a good documentary,"Like many have said around here, this is only a documentary, kind of like the ones you see on television on a sunday afternoon. While it is interesting to know more about Miles and where he came from and how he lived, it's not something that deserves such a price on DVD. What really peeks the interest of the viewers is the footage shown inside the documentary. whether it is Miles playing live with the orchestra led by Gil Evans, or with the Kind of Blue sextet, or the 60's post-bop quintet... etc This documentary should have been a bonus disc to a collection of live performances by Miles.Buy this only if you need a documentary about Miles, otherwise get Live in Munich."
5,Another step in the evolution of PdP,"I raced out to buy In Seed Comes Fruit on the day of its release, and I was not disappointed. Frank Orrall has steered the band into a more soulful dance groove than in past releases. Orrall has let his bandmates contribute much to this effort, and lead vocal duty is shared. ""Had I Known"" and ""You Move Me"" start the disc out strong. ""Keep the Faith"" is a powerful song featuring moving voice samples from Orrall's dad and a family friend who had lost her husband--it's one of the best tracks on the disc. In Seed Comes Fruit is a disc that you can crank up and dance..., or put it on softer and provide a soundtrack to a simple gathering of friends or dinner party, something you don't find with most dance music. If you liked PdP's discs Pomegranate and Natural Thing, you're gonna love this! And if you find Poi coming to your town, do yourself a favor and go see them. They're even better live and a great night out."
3,better to just rent the film,do love Monty Python and i do love Monty Python and the Holy Grail but there's only too much that i can take listening to this movie as a soundtrack...i just remember going to camp with my classmates and having them repeat the dialog to this movie over and over all night long verbatim... and i thought... god... get a life...but it's not to say that i don't like Monty because i did listen to this a few times and still got a few laughs...i actually wish that they did more extra stuff on the soundtrack then just the dialog... because i can hear my dorky camp mates recite all the dialog or i can just rent the movie... but to have the movie being played with John Cleese giving a play by play sports commentary is priceless..plus there are few new bits like Lesson in Logic and Story of the Film So Far that i really thought were funny...the extra stuff on this album is not really worth the money so i say just rent or buy the film!
2,Rather Disappointing,"I was very upset with this disc. I know that the bits from the movie are classic, but I was hoping to have more of the incidental music from the film, most notably the mock heroic theme that accompanies our ""heroes"" through their journey.The additional material can be funny, but it is also extremely raunchy, more so than the actual film which is my favorite Python film because it is the cleanest.All in all, don't bother."
4,This product seems little better than similar products ...,"This product seems little better than similar products I've tried. I think the taste is better, but there's the same residue left in your mouth after chewing it thoroughly and swallowing. It helps with acid stomach as it's advertised. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, but I wouldn't recommend it above others I've tried."
5,ggggreat,"I was looking for some muffs for shooting, i didn't want to pay to much, i found this pair on amazon. and thay work great. well worth the money"
1,Terrible and Silly,"I picked this up just like every other woman thinking that it would be a funny book about how to live gracefully. I was wrong! This book basically states that you are fabulous if you always are in a bad relationship, sleep around a lot (or are always ready to), and have no morals at all. In every chapter of the book there was some mentioning about sex and even a whole chapter devoted to it. It was like reading a script from Sex and the City. Don't let the words ""Fabulous girl"" and ""Decorum"" fool you into thinking that this book is about fabulous girls who are well behaved. It is actually about how to live a pathetic life and have no respect for yourself. Oh, and have whiny friends."
1,Turns out I don't want to be a Fabulous Girl,"If being a Fabulous Girl means sleeping around, putting style above substance, lying on your resume ""the right way"", being shallow and snarky in general, etc., count me out. These authors are so off the mark it's embarrassing. Or maybe it was all a big joke. I think the joke's on them, though. I can't see anyone admiring people who are responsible for this book, except for perhaps the slimiest cretins. I normally donate books I don't like, or resell them; this is the first book I've ever read -- and I've read a lot -- that I am literally going to burn so that no one else has the misforunate of reading it. Absolute trash that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy."
2,"Nice concept, but breaks easily","We bought this item for our three year old who loves the ocean and all that lives in it. There are various sea animals and a diver which makes the kit very appealing. However, it easily breaks ! If you accidentally drop one of the animals, either the tail or the mouth breaks...I've had to glue (or improvise with tape) these parts together. Not fun for the child (crying because a dolphin's tail came off) or for the parent trying to fix it!!"
5,A Beautiful Book,"First published in 1984, Peppers is one of the most beautiful books about any food plant we've ever seen. Author Jean Andrews is not only the artist behind 34 full color plates of the world's capsicums, she is also a thorough historian of food whose work has influenced many books about capsicums that followed hers. Peppers is to the capsicum family what Redcliffe Salaman's The History and Social Influence of the Potato is to solanum tuberosum, with the bonus of color illustrations. Andrews' book explores the origins of the plant, its travels beyond South America, its biological and economic story, its multiple varieties, its most recent high tech implications, and ends with several recipes, and a photographic glossary of botanical terms. Any student of food plants will find repeated value in this book."
3,"A good effort, but not up to the task!","The author clearly put a lot of effort into this book. The problem is the subject matter.Let's face it, the Sicilian Scheveningen is a very complex opening. It's not for anyone but experienced players with high OTB ratings. And this book tries to make it ""Easy""--well, friends, that's just not going to happen.What Pederson has done is provide a nice summary of current (when the book came out) theory. Great. But really it's not enough. You're going to have to learn the principles and fundamentals of this opening elsewhere, if this book is going to be any good to you.Then, once you know what you're doing strategically, the theory in this book comes into play. Buy it before then and you're just wasting your money."
4,A Pretty good bag for the price,"I used this bag for little over a year and it was very durable. However, one of the straps broke off so I had to replace it. If you can afford it, spend some extra money and get a bag with tighter straps and a top zipper for complete protection. But, this is great for average use."
5,Good product,I prefer these silicone gel petals to the other cloth ones. They're pliable and comfortable and last a long time if you keep them in their case. Great for those days when you don't feel like wearing a bra under layers of clothes.
5,The Mirror Has Two Faces,"Jeff Bridges and ""Babs, Dahling!"" combine efforts to spark an excellent look into modern romance from an academic perspective. The two Columbia professors meet through a personal ad, written by a sexually jilted Bridges and answered by lonely Streisand's manipulative sister, after floundering through unsatisfactory relationships that left them both wanting more, much more. How do you find and maintain a lasting substantive love in a world that is aflame with ""silly romantic notions""? Great supporting performances are turned in by Lauren Bacall(Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), George Siegel, Lucy Avery, and Pierce Brosnan. Marvin Hamlisch also walks away from the Oscars with Best Song. Last, but far from least, it is always a delight to watch one of Bab's directed productions in which she also acts, admire her beauty accented by her remarkable nose :-), and also hear Barbra vocalize on the soundtrack. Buy the DVD and, like me, watch it over and over and over again!"
3,"Jeff Bridges - yes, Barbra Streisand - no","Jeff Bridges was darling in the movie. I know he is a professional and would probably never say anything; but, I bet Babs was a real pain to work with....like insisting on being filmed only from one side. Please! Another actress cast in the lead would have made a much better film."
1,Theme,"I don't like the design they showed for marriage. It is totally against Christian teachings. And a Christian movie I was looking for, and this DVD was recommended,but, it turned out not to be a good recommendation."
4,Low-Budget Hilarity,"From the moment you realize the flickering during the opening sequence is actually the shadow of the helicopter blades they filmed the shot from...to the end when you realize the soundtrack contains exactly ONE SONG played over and over again, you know very little money went into this. Doesn't matter...it's a hysterical cult classic made known to most by extensive runs on HBO in their early days.I kind of worried when ordering the DVD that watching the movie today wouldn't be as positive an experience as it was back then, having not seen it in about 20 years. But it is. You'll laugh so hard, you'll get kicked out of Canada."
5,Best of Rolling Stones,Sing along with all your favorite Rolling Stones songs...GREAT! Brings back lots of fond memories from 1971 - 1993. Classic rock at its very best.
4,REMAKES AND OUTFAKES!,"I think this is really a good CD, very well mastered, however it reminds me very much of ""the CD ""Remakes and Outfakes"" The Rolling Stone tribute CD onAmazon!"
3,not the best choice of songs,"This should have included SHATTERED, SHE'S SO COLD, and ONE HIT TO THE BODY, if it was a true greatest hits cd from this time period."
2,What a shame.,"Downloaded this into my laptop with good logitech speakers. Disappointing sound quality. Thin bass, at times very weak treble. Just a poorly recorded, or dubbed or whatever, production. Wish I could get my money back."
4,Best Available?,"It's hard to imagine a Stones fan not being offended by the edited down versions of some of the songs here. ""Miss You"" comes off sounding like an advertising jingle. Add to that the incoherent song sequencing, and you have a real mess. It's also unclear why it's necessary for ""Wild Horses"" and ""Brown Sugar"" to appear on every Stones' compilation. Unfortunately, Jump Back is probably the best Stones' compilation of post-60s material. Jump Back does include all of the band's major hits during the period from 1971 through 1989. Forty Licks suffers from the same problems, besides offering a much weaker overview of their 60s music compared to Rolled Gold+ (or Hot Rocks). With thousands (well, not quite thousands) of RS compilations out on the market, they should have gotten it right by now. Unfortunately not!"
1,No CD with the book!,"I ordered this book because was requested for my English teacher and it suppose to come with a CD but when I received it there was no CD, I returned it and clearly told Amazon the problem was the missing CD, unbeliveble they send me the book again without the CD!, the book without CD is useless!! Don't order this book from here because you will not receive the CD!"
2,Not what it's hyped up to be...,"This product made no difference in my skin color. I used it everyday for over a week, and nothing happened. The body lotion seems to do the trick, but the face lotion doesn't seem to be very effective."
3,It was Ok,"When the season turns my hair starts to thin so I thought I would try this stuff. I honestly did not think it was worth the money. It was Ok, hair was stronger but I have used Phyto's Phytocane and feel it works much better at an even better price."
2,"Not too good; trust me, I should know!","I happen to be familiar with most of monty python's material. I love it. But this CD was done apparantly in some sort of concert form so it's constantly interrupted by wild clapping from the audience. Annoying. And there ARE some of their funniest sketches on there, but they do them 1. at the top of their lungs which does NOT add to the humor and 2. with slight changes in the dialogue, mostly to accomodate their addition of expletives that weren't in the original sketches that also detract from the humor. I'm as much a fan as anyone, but this particular CD butchers their work."
5,Updated Fairy Tale with Good Moral Value,"At my daughter's request, I am reading Black as Night: A Fairy Tale Retold. This is a great book for young teenagers as it follows the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. The outline of the story is a familiar one for most kids, and they will like that the author grabs your attention at the beginning and holds it throughout the story. The main characters are upright teens with a sense of moral fortitude that is lacking in most ""teen reads"" that are on today's bookstore shelves. When faced with sticky social situations involving drugs and other modern cultural dilemna, the characters make decisions to protect their morals, rather than taking the easy way out and falling ""victim"" to their peers. It is a win-win for teens who march to the beat of a different drummer and persist through difficulties in a sometimes heroic fashion."
5,Perfect Laptop Tote,"I love this bag. It's larger than I expected from the photo, which is great. It's big enough to hold my laptop and several large law books. It looks classy and well-made. I highly recommend it."
3,Loved it - until the red dye started to rub off on my things,"It's meant to carry a laptop.I love the design. The red interior looks great, but the color rubs off onto things that are plastic. My white earphones are stained and it doesn't look good. They look old and dirty now. My Kindle has a red cast on the edges, which actually looks a little bit cool. My lip gloss container is almost totally mauve now. It used to be white."
1,Disappointed,"With all the positive reviews I expected this to be a very nice bag. In my opinion, it is very cheap looking inside and out and it too large and cumbersome.....returned."
3,Best deal out there for the price!,The bag is a great utility but could use some more elegance when looking at it from the top. Best value for this is on amazon - best buy had the same thing listed for $119.99
3,"Pleased, but not thrilled.","This is a very useful product, but was a bit bulkier than it looks in the photo. It's more of a briefcase than handbag - it's square, and the zipper runs halfway down the side of the bag. I thought it looked a bit more stylish in the photo. But it works as billed - it can hold quite a bit, and your computer is well protected. I bought it prior to moving overseas, and my biggest concern was that it wouldn't hold up (a previous purchase lasted about three months). I've only been using it for a month now, but I get the sense that it will last for a while.The other thing to note is that the red color of the interior rubs off, particularly on the white cords to my computer, which now are slightly pink."
5,Great deal!,"I bought this bag a year ago and it is still in perfect condition though I use it everyday with a MacBook in it. There is absolutely no wear and tear. The inside of the bag, which is a red fake suede did absolutely not tint my white MacBook or the wires. The bag is incredibly practical with space,for everything I need inside. The compartments are well thought out, though the lipstick holder is way too narrow to hold one, not that it was necessary... It protects very well the computer and most importantly does not look like a computer bag. It is very chic and the fake crocodile is well done, it certainly does not scream *fake*. It comes with a nice protection bag for storage which I appreciate. The only difference I see after using it after a year is that the fake croc lost its shine where it comes into contact with the silver links of the straps, but it is hardlynoticeable. The bag isn't heavy and the straps are very comfortable! Highly recommended!"
3,not so good,"I purchased Best of Angela Bofill and two more of her cds. I recieved only one of my cds . I know that I didn't pay $33.00 for a USDED cd. I have written to Amazon about this, I got NO response,on this matter, I'm not going to buy anything else from Amazon"
4,Vintage Bofill w/ her golden ballads,"This is a timeless album for then and now. I recall 20 years ago buying the 12-inch LP and the cassette of ""The Best of Angela Bofill"". The album logged in lots of playing time on my stereo. Still and now, ""TBoAB"" is good easy listening from the past as well as for the present. For anyone who is not familiar with Bofill's voice and career, this cd works well as an introductory course-- sort of ""Bofill 101"". For her fans who most likely have this cd in their collection already, it's a good refresher mini-course. I happened to take that course for a few mornings last week while getting ready for work. The cd lulled me into a nice time warp, during an extra-long shower as I replayed ""I Try"" three times, and also used my hairbrush as a microphone to duet with Angela as we belted out ""Break It To Me Gently"". (C'mon, you've done it, too-- 'fess up!)It's fun when the golden r&b; ballads can still take you back in time. And going back with Angela Bofill is The Best!"
2,Plateau Music,"Pinback are really talented musicians, but I can't help but feel like they achieve only half their potential. I can appreciate that they are going for a unique sound, but in keeping with that, it inevitably makes all their songs sound too similar. Each song sounds like a track that would go between two louder, harder, edgier or whatever tracks. There's such a lack of tension, build up, and climax with this singular, Drop-D acoustic plucking approach. There's no uphill or downhill in the listening experience - just a plateau.That sad, I really like the song ""Fortress."""
3,"Not novel, but quite enjoyable","Id say Id give this 3.5 stars. I thoroughly enjoy listening to this album- but it's not very different in tone/ attitude from the other 2 albums. However, it seems they have definitely perfected their ""style"" and I look forward to hearing them try to branch out a bit. However if I was hearing this album (and had not heard other Pinback albums) I'd fall in love with it- i guess I was just a little disappointed that it was more of the same, when I think they could push the envelope."
5,This Classic Remains A Great Read!,"I read this book 25 years ago, and recently reread parts of it. What a great book! Many of the most prominent living economists have justly heaped praise on Heilbroner's masterpiece. I can only add my hearty agreement."
4,I love these sandals,"I bought these for the reflexology massage that it gives my swollen feet after running, cycling, etc. It took me two days to get used to wearing them without socks and now I wear them everyday as often as I can. I would wear them all day if I could. I haven't had any nodules break and have worn them inside and out over the last two months. I am considering the Kenkoh sandal but at nearly four times the cost I could get several of these. I think the Kenkoh has raised nodules in certain areas the addisage does not. Frankly I wish the nodules were even harder. I love these and they look great too."
5,best of the best,This CD bring me back to 18 years ago and make my drime return to that time Ilove in my live. In that time I and my family love this music and evry time we went in trip with my father we have to but in the car acassite of the boey m. I love boney m very very much
3,misrepresented,"Whenc I purchased this item i expected it to be signed by Richardson because it said ""signed""...disappointed"
3,Jump n' Jab,"I wasn't overly thrilled with this firm dvd. I love Kelsey's 500 calorie burn workout, but this one was a little confusing. She moves really fast and some of the moves are a little awkward. I will say that after finishing the workout, I was definately sweating and could tell I had really worked out. I was hoping for a little more kickboxing and a little less lunging with weights. Don't get me wrong, lunges are great but it seems to be more lunging than anything else. Im hoping this dvd will grow on me once I can get all of the moves down correctly. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would rate this workout at around a 6."
3,It's OK,"I really wanted to like this workout, but it fell a little short. First, it isn't 45 minutes. Including the warm-up, it's under 40. They must be adding on this strange 5 minute workout 'bonus' that is on the DVD.They have a new set...it's really bad. It looks like a 70s sitcom.I found myself looking for a bit more direction. The cueing was a bit off. There were a few new moves which was good because I think The Firm is getting stale.All in all, it's a shorter workout that will rev you up for a bit. Maybe for a day when you want to take it easy."
3,Mediocre,"This book is okay for giving suggestions, not really a teaching book. This is for those who already have an idea of what they are doing."
5,4 new creatures?! What?!!!,"This is basically Black & White and Creature Isle in one, with some exeptions. There are four new creatures that you can use in the original, but they are available in Creature Isle. Here they are:Mandrill:Average stats, and a little up on reaction (but not nearly as much as the Leopard)Horse: A little up on intelligence, and really good running speed. Stronger than the Cow, but not much.Leopard: Really fast, best reaction time of all, but not very smart. Weaker than the Tiger.Gorilla: Fat, strong, slow, and average intelligence."
4,Dallas is always good,Never read dallas willard and expect it to be a bad book. all of his stuff is very well thought out and very interesting to read. This book has a whole lot of good practical aplication. I recommend it for anyone from any circle of faith.
4,Hearing God,"Reissue of original is so appropriate...in today'world we spend so much time giving our opinions and telling people what to do (including our spouses and kids) that we have forgotten what we can learn relationally simply through listening...as God's children we do the same with our Creator and Savior...read this book as a reminder and also as an ""enricher"" to your relationship with Him."
5,Make this the companion to Willard's other xlnt books,"Dallas Willard's consistency over many years of writing becomes incredibly clear as you read this re-release. Contrasting this earliest book to The Divine Conspiracy (1998) and The Spirit of the Disciplines (1988), one sees how well Dr Willard's work holds together. Each book emphasizes a theme and each stands strongly on its own (you'll note he is not your ""book a year"" kind of author--lot's of quality here). I am on my 3rd read of this in about a year and continue to chew it thoroughly. Hats off to IVP for re-releasing it (though I like the original title better). I commend it to readers tired and frustrated with much of what is taught about prayer and where they are and God is in all of it. Dr Willard has been given a great gift and he shares it freely here."
3,audiobook review,"Gardner's narration of this text is performed at a faster pace, requiring the listener to ""keep up"" with his quick speech. With clear dictation, Gardner reads in what can only be described as a ""weasel-like"" voice, not out of a character flaw, but out of an actual sound. This made it hard to listen to, and near impossible to enjoy, what Willard's text provides. Nevertheless, based off my encounters with Willard, it would seem that Gardner's narration is only on-par with a simulation of the writer.Read the complete review, and FTC disclosures, at scriptedgenius(dot)com."
2,Came damaged,"It will do, but it's definitely not the best frame I've ever seen. The price, however, leads me to accept the merchandise in its condition, but it IS dented and scratched."
5,Exactly as pictured,This frame arrived as pictured and described on Amazon. It is a nice quality for the price and I will likely purchase additional frames to match.
5,Excellent,"This book is great for expanding your vocabulary, it gives you the words you need to know and is especially helpful if you're preparing for the SAT I"
5,Beer and Coffee is amazing,I love all of the songs on this cd; each one outdoes the last. Matthew Ebel never ceases to amaze me. ^^
5,Great CD,This is one of the best Christian CD's I have ever owned and I have several. Many reviewers compare Zoegirl with Jump5 but this Zoegirl CD is much better than any of Jump5's in my opinion. There are several great songs on this CD that seem to get better the more you listen to them. I highly recomend buying this CD.
4,Eat It!,"Four of us played, it was fun. There were some items we had never heard of, and one of the reasons I purchased it was that some users said it was particularly oriented to east coast products (we are native New Jerseyans). I was surprised I didn't know so many items (We are ages 61, 59, 33, 29). But we still enjoyed it!"
4,Good quality but not her best,"The cd had about four songs that I liked, but the bulk of the songs were unknown to me."
2,"Interesting plot, stilted style.","Allen, in his prefatory notes explains that this is compilation of two previous works. He is also careful to point out that he has polished the earlier works with acquired skills as a writer. Had I had the misfortune to encounter those earlier works, I can guarantee I would have avoided this book. The plot is interesting, but the characters are flat and contrived, plot devices appears as afterthoughts and undeveloped inventions, and the style is plodding. Still, one hopes this author matures in his talent. Occaisionally the flash of style is there, yet fades too quickly."
2,clicker,This product was not at all as I expected. I f it were convenient I would return it for a refund. Please advise those considering purchase to not do it.RPFrank
3,"Good, but not exactly as pictured","The cartouche is very pretty and true to described size, but the bottom symbol is not a beetle but what I think is a lotus flower. I am still happy with the purchase, but it would have been nice to know exactly what I was getting."
5,Worked as planned,Used for a 5ft wide wood door on a small barn I built. Had to buy the matching track at Tractor Supply. Works great and even better when sprayed with a little Blaster Garage Door lubricant.
4,Good but limited study of conservative anti-imperialists.,"This biographical study of twelve prominent anti-imperialistswon the John H. Dunning Prize from the American HistoricalAssociation. It is especially strong in tracing the lifeexperiences and ideological backgrounds of its subjects. Itis limited, however, to discussing Republican and Mugwump(former Republican) anti-imperialists, a choice that seemsodd for a study of a movement that endorsed the Democraticparty in every election from 1900 to 1920. It also closeswith the election of 1900 even though the Anti-ImperialistLeague continued to operate until 1921."
5,What a great find!,"I bought this as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day as she has been hinting around at wanting one for a long time. I was so excited when it arrived just 2 days after I ordered it and couldn't wait until Mother's Day to give it to her. I made sure to check it out when it arrived and it was in perfect condition, no a scratch anywhere. Mom used it the day she got it and has made several dozen cookies since then, as well as cakes and mashed potatoes. I've even had to opportunity to use it and it's just amazing! A very good bargain! Would recommend to anyone!"
5,Powerful Motor Very Solid,"I used this to make pizza dough last night and the power of the motor on this baby is amazing. Solid quality and looks good too. If you are weak, this may be a little heavy for you to move around. The mixer banged the bowl slightly when I tried it but the manual shows how to easily adujust for that. This is a excellent value."
5,Great price,"I can't disagree with what others have said. It's a great machine at a good price. If only to nit-pick, mine came in excellent, but still visibly used condition. The machine had a small paint chip at the tilt head joint. The bowl was uniformly scratched on the surface from light use, but had no dings. One of the rubber feet on the bottom needed to be nudged so the base would sit flat on my countertop. I had to adjust the height screw, but after that it worked like a charm. I liked saving $50 from the typical outlet price, along with free Amazon shipping.Even though it still works fine, I finally upgraded from my 10+ year old Kitchenaid hand mixer. Now I can prepare other ingredients while the mixer does its thing.Unlike other kitchen appliances, the manual/cookbook is in color, uses quality glossy paper, and has a nice spiral binding."
3,"textbook polysyllabic language, interesting case studies","This book was suggested to me as a more reader-friendly look at narcissistic personality disorder. Unfortunately the author's high-flown textbook language often mired me in words more than ideas. Nonetheless, there is some interesting analysis given to such works as Tolstoy's Anna Karenina...among many others."
5,Pyrite egg,"This is a beautiful piece of art for the egg collector or geologist. The egg arrived exactly as promised, on time and simply lovely."
4,A very good book overall,"This is a well written and easy to read book. Joslin takes a scholarly (and not snobbish) look at the Dracula movies made over the past few decades. My only complaint about McFarland books in general is that I wish they contained more photos and illustrations. However, the end-all-be-all of ""Dracula at the Movies"" books still belongs to Midnight Marquee's Dracula book."
3,snapshots of life in Dublin,"I have to admit that I didn't read all the stories(I did it for school as a HS junior, they didn't require reading all of them) and it's not the most exciting book. However, Joyce's stories are like snapshots of everyday life and I'm fascinated by that. He gives us vivid images of how unattractive Dublin is and tours into the minds the characters. Some stories are boring and hard to read but Joyce is good enough as a storyteller to give us pictures of life in Dublin that stick in your head."
4,under my expectations,"I was expecting a little more from this work. A few stories I just did not understand the point, they just never reached any climax. On the other hand, even the weakest items still put me in the scene and captured an atmoshphere which most short fiction collections cant."
5,Sure it's grand- No it's great,"I bought this after seeing a wonderful one-man play by Declan O'Gorman based on 'Dubliners'. I'd read some of the stories when much younger, but this time round I'm in a better position to appreciate the richness of character, the pathos mixed with humour and the special insight into the Irish/Dublin soul. It's a great book....next stop Ulysses."
5,A rael morale booster for teens!,"As a mother of an overweight teen, I often watched my daughter struggle with feelings of ""not fitting in"" with her peers at school. This terribly upset me--even more so, when I found myself helpless--there was nothing I could do to ease my daughters pain. The ridicule from her classmates terribly scarred her. But when I watched an interview with ""Growing Up Gottis"" Frank Gotti, about how he lost over 80 pounds, I ran out and bought the book. It was the greatest gift I could give to my daughter. Frank talks about programs and proper eating--and of course his astounding weight loss--but more importantly, he talks about ""gaining the proper confidence"" to do so. My daughter considers the book to be her bible--and I am grateful to the author! Maureen Higgins, Hicksville Long Island."
5,Great Item,I use Cerama Bryte to clean my glasstop stove and have no problems with it. It cleans all of my messes and keeps the cooktop looking new. This is a great product and the safest cleaner to use on your glasstop stove!
3,A Partial Reunion Of The John/Taupin Songwriting Team,"""21 At 33"" was Elton John's first good album since ""A Single Man""; it's most noteworthy for being a partial reunion of the Elton John/Bernie Taupin songwriting team, which broke up after ""Blue Moves"". Unfortunately, my favorite tune is the hit ""Little Jeannie"", which Elton John co-wrote with lyricist Gary Osborne. It's more successful muscially and lyrically than either of the John/Taupin tunes on this album which others have singled out for praise: ""Two Rooms At The End Of The World"" and ""White Lady, White Power"". The best John/Taupin track is the rocker ""Chasing The Crown"". Other tunes were co-written by Tom Robinson (""Sartorial Eloquence"", the other standout tune on this album) and Judie Tzuke ""Give Me The Love""). Along with Bernie Taupin, Elton is reunited with his original band mates drummer Nigel Olsson and bassist Dee Murray on several tracks; for example, Olsson is the drummer for ""Little Jeannie"".)."
2,disappointing,"Save for a few songs (Two Rooms, Sartorial Eloquence, White Powder), the sound and songs didn't measure up to Elton's normal brilliance."
1,I Think There's A Mistake Here,"I'm not rating this as I feel that there's been a mistake. This is not the album ""21 at 33"". I know this because ""Little Jeannie"" doesn't sound like the ""Little Jeannie"" I've heard over the last 25 years. This sounds like pan flute music. I wanted to bring this to someone's attention."
5,Brilliant,"every song is good, and elton shows us why he dips in every gendre of music, because he can and does it with excellence. From homoerotic ballads that chicks love to country songs, to disco""victim of love"" stuff to songs about cocaine, to songs about playing the devil and stealing your soul ""give me the love give me the key to your heart"" OK. I love this album it's in the top 3 with single man and jump up, Dear God, great song. not that i'm religous i just like it. Elton you should have stayed on drugs tying up call boys in the woods, your music was much better in the late 70's and early 80's then it is today"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this book. It is very educational,too. The best part was when Stickeen crosses the ice bridge.The way Donnell Rubay puts the words together,leaves you in suspense."
4,a good read,"I enjoyed this book. It was a good, warm book between a human and a dog. I like dogs!J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"solid hardware, locking seems very finicky",Hardware is solid and sturdy and they include different screw lengths. But the spindle needs to be trimmed off in thinner storm doors. I tried to do so for my mother's old door. The locking mechanism doesn't seem to work maybe because the spindle I trimmed is not exactly the right length. (I didn't have very good tools in my mom's house and the spindle is solid metal) I don't care much about the locking since the old lock wasn't holding at all and I don't consider a storm door lock to be any protection but be aware of the spindle issue. The spindle is long enough for a thick door. There are no directions except a diagram on the back of package but if you stare at it long enough you can get it.
5,STRONG figures!,My mom got me this about a week ago anyways heres what the figures do: SU-BAK-NA-He can fly and has an enchantment for something very strong! By the way I think the guy riding the dragon is su-bak-na correct me if I'm wrong. Charos it's pronounced car-os. By the way some people don't understand counter strike first you roll defese dice then the dice that didn't come up shields is unblockable hits to the opponent. but the person attacking must be addjacent. If ccharos dies before the counter strike you can't use it I don't think he also has flying. Deathwalker [I forget the #] has a rapid fire thingy which lets him keep attacking..... blah blah blah... Im to tired to tell the rest anyway a great addition to your heroscape collection! I totally reccomend it!
3,Good story line....,"But not the best of Kristin Hannah novels. I was waiting for more, didn't Daniel want to know where she came from??..."
2,So Predictable and Sappy,"This book is my first introduction to Ms. Hannah's writing and I'm very disappointed. The writing is hokey, sickeningly sweet and syrupy. The ""twist"" was minor and didn't really impress me. I bought this as a travel read for the plane and couldn't wait to get back to my home airport to get my Read and Return 50% refund. If you're looking for mind candy that doesn't require a lot of participation on the part of the reader, Comfort and Joy is your best bet."
5,"""Comfort and Joy"" - a truly fitting title","Hannah's books are always great. Her characters are believable and soon seem like people you've known in real life, and their problems and happinesses are real. They have all-too-human flaws and doubts.This book, though, with its unusual plot, was even better than usual. I didn't quite get it all at one sitting, but dinner was late and I went to bed at about 2:00 a.m!The thing that puzzles me is that there is a Lifetime Channel holiday movie, made in 2003, with the same title and a tiny kernel of the basic plot of Hannah's book. The book is easily a thousand times better than the movie. Which came first?"
4,Another great book from A great author,Wow. This story took a an amazing twist. I love to be surprised in the middle of a great story.
1,Comfort and Joy,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Kristin Hannah's books. THis book is the only one I really do not connect with....it is not good at all, I am finishing it just because I bought it and want to know what all of her books are like. I feel like this one is very elementary, and Im not sure if it is her that wrote it??? Her others are way way better. She rocks, but this book does not."
3,Average,"The reviews for Comfort and Joy are all over the board and I am going to take a middle of the road approach. I am usually a huge fan on Kristin Hannah and will read her books without even knowing what they are about but I was let down with Comfort and Joy. The story premise was a good idea but the ""magical"" aspects went a bit too far and it actually turned me off from the book. I will be picking up the next book by Hannah (which takes place in the same town) and reading it no matter what.If you are looking for a good holiday story - try A Redbird Christmas by Fannie Flagg and I am sure you will enjoy it."
1,completely predictable and huge let down,I am a huge fan of K.H. but this book was one of the worst reads I have yet to read. I knew exactly what was happening by chapter 4 or so and the ending was too short and well just a huge let down. Big climax that led to a very disapointing finish. I know this book is cheap but not worth the $7
3,Product great--Packaging SHAMEFUL,I recently ordered a refill as I didn't have time to go to Sephora. My little tube came in a box 30X its size and stuffed with a bunch of styrofoam peanuts.Come on!This is shameful. No way will I reorder this online. Laura Mercier (the merchant in this case) really needs to become more ecoconscious ASAP.
5,love it,This is so easy to go on and blend in. I use the porcelain shade. I love it. It is a great moisturizer. It provides minimal coverage (just enough that I need). I also like the fact it same a little SPF in it.
5,Seriously Oil Free!!,"I have oily skin and had a heck of a time trying to find a moisturizer/sunscreen that wouldn't leave my face looking like a grease pit.Luckily i found it in Laura Mercier's Tinted oil free.It works like a charm, dosen't leave me looking shiny or oily at all and protects your face from sun.Better yet it has the sheerest hint of color that will dress you up when you dont feel like putting on an entire face.And say the morning after a long night out, you can even layer it for additional coverage on the under-eye circles.Its not heavy or thick feeling on your face either.Would I recommend this to someone...a best friend or family member, maybe? Definitely.It was a life (face?) saver and I will be back for more; it is also on my ""Top 10 products I can't SURVIVE without"" list.Its an ace of a product and is absolutely worth every penny.Highly, HIGHLY recommended."
2,In The 70s?,"A lot of great sixties bands made lame albums in the seventies, and this is definitely that. Eric Burden had the potential to be a great rock vocalist, he squandered it trying to be a mediocre blues vocalist, as this album aptly demonstrates. Fans of the band should stick to comps or the sixties albums, this album should just fade away."
3,i heard such glowing reviews...but in all honesty...,"It isn't a bad listen and there are some cool songs that aren't usually performed (dire wolf, the race is on, ripple) but, i cannot say that this is better than the 'bears choice' release from the seventies on warner/reprise. i love gd and i feel this has the potential to grow on me. but, as far as first listens go, i still prefer 'bear's' to this one."
5,Great little inexpensive hand cutter,"This cutter is easy to maneuver with its comfortable scissor-like handle. I like the way the blade retracts behind a plastic protector for safety but can be locked into the open position with a thumb operated button. In the retracted position, the cutter can be slid up to a cutting guide without dragging the blade across your material.Blade changes are a snap and can be performed in seconds. You'll want to make sure you wipe the manufacturing oil from any new blade before use so that you don't get oil on your material."
