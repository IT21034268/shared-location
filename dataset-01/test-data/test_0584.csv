3,"OK Swing But, not too strong a swinging motion","I bought this swing after several people I know registered for it. I thought that it would be great to have in my office since it is compact and folds up. This is the best part about this swing.My only gripe with the swing is that It doesn't do a great job at swinging. My 4 month old daughter is 16lbs and I have to put the swing on the highest setting and that doesn't even really move too quickly. According to the box, this swing is supposed to be good until 25lbs! No way! At 25lbs you'd be going through a pack of batteries a day and a really sloooow swing.I give it 3 stars for portability and storage convenience... 2 stars for swinging ability."
5,Great Travel Swing,I just purchased this swing for my newborn and I am impressed. After purchasing the Graco Travel Lite swing and being very disappointed this fisher price swing is wonderful. It has a much better range of motion than the graco travel swing and the seat is padded much better. Also the toys are linked so that you can make them reach your child if you want them to be able to play with them. Also you have the option to buy additional link a doos to make this even more fun. I would highly recommend this swing to anyone looking for a smaller more compact swing.
2,Baby got bored,"He ended up liking his full-size swing much better... never looked completely comfortable/relaxed in this. As a result, it wasn't ever worthwhile to take it anywhere, so portability was useless."
5,Great Swing!,"This swing is great! My daughter loves it, Before I bought the swing I read the reviews posted on here and hesitated because some were saying their child got hurt. However, the only way I could see a baby getting hurt using it is if you are using when they are to young to be in it! If the baby can't support its own head yet it may not be for you. (unless you have a head support to use)All it takes is a little common sense! Before you buy it go to the store they have them on display check them out in person! I am sure its not for every baby but my daughter absolutely loves it. She shows so much excitement when we put her in it. She loves the little dog and cat rattle toys. I love it becasue it is portable and can go back and forth to Grandmas house easily and it is not a big bulky swing taking up way to much room in my living room!"
2,Do some more research before you buy this swing,"I know there is not much to choose from when looking for a ""portable"" swing. However, I have 9 week old twin girls and I wish we would not have purchased this product. They hate sitting in it and cry whenever we try to put them in it. The back support and design are not good and put the babies in an awkward position. They love their full size Aquarium swings, but this one was a waste of $$$. My 3 year old is using it as a toy for her dolls."
2,brandnew_mommy,"I bought this swing to take on my vacation. I really like the linkadoos line because it allows you to change the toys and keep baby interested. Its cute, compact and lightweight.The problem with this swing is that it has no back support, its too upright. My 3 month old baby was either slumping forward or off to the side looking very uncomfortable. I took it on vacation and rarely used it. I worried that even with the safety belt he might fall off the sides. Now that we're home I'd rather drag the full size all over the house rather than using this one."
3,needs a few adjustments,"I got the Linkadoos take along swing as a gift. I started using it when my baby was about 3 months old. My daughter would flop to one side while in the the swing. It did not happen everytime we used the swing but it should not happen at all. I did report this problem to Fisher Price and they are paying for me to send the swing back and giving me a full refund. They just need to design a seat to better support the baby. Very cute product, I would purchase a new one if they design the seat better."
2,OK swing,"My son is not very entertained by this swing yet. He only lasts about 5 minutes. It has not been worth the money for me, I'm desiring this to change because it is so easy to take along."
1,absolutely terrible,i am a huge huge van damme fan i love all his old films but his recent films have been only ok but im sorry to say this jcvd film was terrible it was boring no action ok maybe good story i found myself falling asleep watching this i would certainly not watch it a 2nd time no way im shocked this film got good reviews off everybody but come on jcvd fans ask yourself was this film really good why was it good because he cried about his life during the film come on plus im very angry with van damme because he turned down stallones expendables because this was his only chance to make it big and to make it to the cinema again and he blew it you'll see his next films will be only ok because all his latest films are unknown directors actors etc i hope im wrong but i dont think so (dave cully ireland)
4,classic cartoon,i used to rent this tape from a local video store when i was a kid.i havent been able to find in almost 13 years.i finally found it here.wally gator is a gret classic cartoon.
5,The Top Tricks of the Trade...,"Joseph Sugarman has put the best techniques for selling anything in an interesting and (thankfully!) easy to read book. Where most business books come across dry and impersonal, Triggers encourages the readers to get involved.Joe's help has made me a better salesperson and his extremely valuable help will no doubt lead to increased profits for years to come! Thank you, Joe!"
2,Not that Great,It reminds me of uthanizm. I did not like it. Theres no hard songs. I'm a die hard Lynch fan. If I your not down with uthanizm don't buy it. Its a dissapointment. I think .
4,rise of nations for vista,The game seems to play well with only a minor glitch. The glitch that I found was that the mountains would remain illuminated after the area had been explored. So far that is the only thing that was not the same as the original version I had for windows 2000 and windows XP. I or rather my grandson was grateful for the opportunity to play the game on my computer which has windows vista as an OS.
2,Riley and Sam dominate this boring and lifeless novel.,"Of all the characters in the Buffyverse they had to create a novel with Riley and Sam as the leads. And, what is worse they actually manage to make Riley look more lifeless then he ever was on the show. Also, there is no Spike whatsoever in this novel. It would probably best for anyone that isn't a hard core Riley/Sam fan to avoid this novel. I still can't believe how boring this book was, that was a several hours of my life I will never get back. It felt like one long boring car ride that just wouldn't end."
2,This was a mistake,"I bought this to go on my GL-2 which I use as a second camera for sports videography.I put the wide angle adapter on the camera when the camera was new and left it there as my intent was to always use it for close shots.I was always dissapointed with the video quality of the GL-2. I thought it was simply not up to par with my Sony because the Sony is a High Def camera.However I always download the high def camera to editing software using the Standard def output.Therefore, I would expect the video quality to be comparable but that was never the case.On a recent family vacation, I pulled the adapter off and was surprised to see the sharpness had improved dramatically.Now I know that putting more glass in front of the camera is going to cost you some clarity that is to be expected.However, this lens adapter either messes with the autofocus or degrades the image significantly.What good is a wide angle shot if you can't get decent results?"
2,Not worth the price,"The Palgrave Atlas of Byzantine HistoryThis atlas can be use as a first approach to the Byzantine world. But to buy it one must have the courage to do it! The price is not worth it. It cannot be use as a text sidebook, but only to see in a library."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This diaper stacker was smaller than I expected and the colors weren't quite what I expected either. I originally purchased it just to add a little more color to the room, but now I'm realizing that it was unnecessary (plus it doesn't exactly match like I expected). Next time, I'll skip the diaper stacker altogether."
4,"Simply Put, the best computer I've ever owned","I think the title says it all, the display is wondeful and big with a viewing angle that is amazing. The feel and the look of the laptop is great. The battery has a long life as well as everything I need standard. It feels snappy, much more snappier then I expected from a laptop and OS X is just a joy to have. I love almost everything about it, and I wouldn't give it up for anything.But, there are always buts, I do have a few problems with it (hince the 4 stars). First and foremost is the paint chipping problem. It is kinda annoying and I wish it could be better. Second, is that it is extremely hard to get the ethernet cord out of the back of the machine because the hinge interfers. Finally, the Airport range is smaller compared to iBooks. But do not get me wrong, I strongly reccomend this computer to anyone and the problems I have are only minnor annoyances."
2,"Dull, yellowy light.","First off, this really didn't fit my 29-gallon high...overlaps about a quarter inch on either side of the tank, but no big deal...The lamp inside is a Marineland 18T8 Natural Daylight fluorescent. Not bright at all, with a yellowish glow. I had an Aqueon 8,000K Full Spectrum Daylight lamp (17 watts) laying around from when my old hood died, and tried installing that instead. Too much juice for the igniter, because it just kept flickering and wouldn't fully light. Too bad, because that was a bright white light that really illuminated the tank well.You get what you pay for...this was the cheapest light I could find on Amazon (or elsewhere), and it shows..."
5,dude these guys rock!,"I think that this is a great CD, I especially think that one week and it's all been done are awesome! One Week with the fresh variety of lyrics and humor make it a gnarly song. I think alchohol should not be included on the CD."
5,Da-Bomb!,"It was back to the drawing boards for the ladies when they had to come up with a new album. This is a wonderful mix of pep, zaz, and soft sounds. Every song is a winner. I hope that this is a sign of better things to come. I can't wait for their next idea."
1,It was horrible,"I can't believe that I actually bought this c.d. It was just horrible. I bought it because I just loved ""One Week"". I thought that the other songs on the c.d. would be somewhat close to it. They weren't I can't even think of any of the other songs that I can bare to listen to. Very disappointing."
2,DON'T JUST BUT IT FOR ONE WEEK-YOU WILL NOT LIKE IT!,"Do not buy this CD just because you like ""One Week"". Odds are that you won't like it. That's what I did, and I can't stand this CD. None of their other songs are as fast as One Week. Heck, none of their other songs are good. Buy their previous CDs. Those are awesome. BNL didn't do too hot with this one."
2,Too much and Not Enough,"That is the best way to describe the Barenaked Ladies. This album exemplifies it. While no song on the album is just straight awful, the album and the band lack something undeniable. In some ways, they want to goof off and do it completely in some songs. In others, they make various witty remarks while trying to encompass a serious topic- Alcohol. It all falls just a touch short of complete sincerity. They are like a bunch of fraternity brothers rocking out at the Delta House at the local private college on a Saturday night. That makes the CD just a few listens before throwing the CD and moving on to Britney Spears or Soundgarden, whichever way your musical tastes lie. Make no mistake, Stunt is a powerful record industry promoted pop powerhouse of an album. If you're the kind of person who likes the change of pace your local pop radio station gives you, this album could be very well-recieved by you. It's just not me."
3,Some moments of glory,Being a Barenaked fan for the past six years I have to admit that this is not one of their finer efforts. A true fan will always find material on Gordon to be the most outstanding but there are some really great moments on this disc especially the crafted Some Fantastic and I'll be that Girl. As they've gotten older the boys have defintely mellowed out. But we all know that it's all worth it at a live show.
5,Great CD mixing together lots of different styles!,I think Stunt was the best CD I have bought in a long time. I was glad all the songs weren't exactly like 'One Week' like I kind of expected them to be. BNL seems to have fun experimenting with different styles of music and their songs go deeper than most popular music these days. I love 'Light up my room' and 'I'll be that girl' I'm buying Rock Spectacle as soon as I can!
5,"Hate ""One Week,"" love the rest.","I've been to several of the BNLs hilarious, spontaneous live shows, shows which seem to have the same audience as ""Rocky Horror,"" only with Kraft dinner instead of rice and toilet paper. When ""One Week"" initially came out, it was a huge disappointment. I thought, ""Jeez, the BNLs have really sold out."" The song is annoying, the video moronic (I'm hoping it's an attempt at irony). Fortunately, the BNLs transcend the expectations of their audience(s), and Page/Robertson could be the next Lennon/McCartney (okay, just a little hyperbole there). A witty, ironic, touching, ingenious album--well, just like all the rest. Get ""Rock Spectacle,"" and you'll pretty much have the best of BNLs."
5,Uh..Amazon..Could you give us an option for a 6th star?,"Since I don't want to be redundant, my review is simply this... [See all other 5 star rated reviews on this page. Ignore the rest. They must have listened to a different CD. (No offense)]"
2,Gets old real fast,The Cd was fine the first couple times but all the songs on here get old after a couple of listens to it. Don t waste your money it isnt worth it.
4,Cool!!,I liked this a lot. I wish it had a multimedia extra on it like Rock Spectacle. I loved One Week.
2,"Like they say, it's all been done before...","I first got introduced to BNL back in '93, and I thought they were terrific. Never picked up MYSD, but with BOAPS, I got enthusiastic again. Rock Spectacle was a terrific reminder of one of the most energetic shows I've ever seen, and now... For one thing, it seems that Ed didn't get much sleep while making this album, considering how often he writes about it. While the lyrics are still as original as ever, they seem to have fallen into a musical rut on this disc. If you're new to BNL and are looking for a disc with a wide variety of musical styles plus some of the wittiest lyrics you'll find, I'd recommend ""Gordon"" first to see what these guys are capable of, or (in a crosswise plug), Moxy Fruvous' ""Bargainville"". If you're an old-time fan, don't bother rushing out for this one."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I LOVE Rock Spectacle, Gordon, Born an a Pirate Ship, the Yellow Tape, BNL is a wonderful band. However, I believe that BNL's management rushed them into delivering a product before the guys had a chance to ""tune it up."" Stunt shows many audio 'signs' of a typical rush job; which the recording industry often forces its talent to do. Sooooooo, don't blame the 'Ladies, they're probably as unhappy as quite a few of their fans are regarding the quality of Stunt. Until the next, hopefully better-planned CD arrives, we still have all the pre-Stunt tunes to groove on."
2,Annoying Packed Pop (to make someone money),"Yeah, this one sounds like they put it together too fast. It lacks substance...I was one of those suckers who got it for ""one week"" (although I've known about the group since 1992), but was left feeling rather empty after listening to it the first time, and not much better thereafter. In fact, I've actually tried to sell it used three times and the guys at the used record stores rejected it. I would say this is for dedicated fans - but overall this sounds like the ringing of money in someone's pockets..After all, it is a business."
2,Not as simple or cost effective as they would have you believe,"A bit disappointed, pricing for parts seems outdated. I don't weld or want to spend the high dollars for a shaft. I will buy a prebuilt."
5,Wow A Total blast....,"This is one hell of a cd, i picked it up locally yesterday. Hedwig's music is amazing, as is the movie, in theatres July 20th NY/LA/SF and Nationwide Aug 3rd.. Check it out you won't be disappointed.. Glam rock at its best..Rock on- Ryan"
5,Hedwig Rocks!,"I'm a brazilian moviegoer, unfortunatelly movies takes some time to open here in Brazil, but that's OK. Hedwig and the angry inch was much praised by the press, and I was kinda anxious to see it, it took a long time as always but I went to see it. Being a musical fan I should definetly check it out. The movie turned out to be great, with marvellous songs that simply can touch our hearts. I was amazed with the song ""Origin of Love"" it really blew my out and another that is wonderful is ""Wig in a Box"". John Cameron Mitchell was a total stranger to me, but now I know that he rocks! This is a truly inspired musical that'll be remembered for a long time! and I hope that his career keeps growing!"
1,Not Hoover Bags,"Despite the photo of Hoover bags and the description which states Hoover bags, these ARE NOT made by Hoover. If you are looking for Hoover brand, look elsewhere."
4,Star Wars Freak? Get This Game!!!!!,"""Begun, this Clone War has.""-Master Yoda. He's right. The one [bad] thing about it is that Yoda is NOT, repeat, NOT a playable character. Spanning 5 Worlds and a truckload of Levels to play, with Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Mace Windu as playable characters, you don't see this every day. But, there is a Rival Game on it's way in November. Star Wars Bounty Hunter. Look out, Clone Wars!"
4,Live the Clone Wars,"If you want to explore the Clone Wars further but don't like the animated Star Wars, the Clone Wars game lets you live the Clone Wars. Even after 8 years, the graphics aren't too bad and it has some fun levels. Most of the levels are fought in a tank, but it also has first-person jedi and republic gunship levels. It doesn't have as much replay value as, say Rogue Squadron, but it's still worth it if you've always dreamed about living in this particular part of the Star Wars universe."
2,"Good graphics, dreadful game","If you liked that other dreadful LucasArts game Jedi Starfighter then this one is for you. But aside from the hype and graphics this isn't much of a ""game"". Most of the action is preprogrammed and the game amounts mostly to eye-candy without much substance (much like the movie). Rent, don't buy."
4,One of the few 2-player coop games for the 'cube,"If you like battling armies of droids with your buddy standing beside you, Star Wars the Clone Wars is what you want. The replay value is limited, so you might want to rent this one to see how you like it before you buy."
2,"Beat it in two days, I just played 4 hours in total","Ithought this was gonna be the best Star Wars game ever, I thought this was gonna be so cool but I was very disappointed in the plot of the game. You basically have to do the same, shoot,shoot, and fire rockets. The explotions are great and some of the scenarios are amazing, what I didnt like is that it was way to short. Oh almost forgot when you use the jedis it really hard to move them around.As for me Im gonna return it, I suggest you rent it first and if you like well...... do what ever u want. Oh... The Multiplayer thing is very cool Id say thats the best thing it has. In conclusion it doesnt surpass the other Star Wars games."
5,Very Surprised How Much I Enjoyed This Game!!,"Even though I'm in my late 30's, I very much enjoy playing a good game and this one definitely is. Ten thousand times better than ""Star Wars: Rebel Strike"". Graphics are good; flying mode is a thousand times better than ""Rebel Strike""; and it is very fun to keep switching vehicles throughout the game. There are a few other times that you are on foot with a light saber. Every level here is sheer fun and excitement. I have played this game many times over and it still is very fun to play. I hate to admit it, but I cannot seem to defeat the very last level with the Dark Reaper without cheats. I highly recommend this game."
1,basically... it just sucks,"how else can i put it? it just sucks. of course if you want to find out for yourself, feel free to play it and you'll probably feel the same way."
4,Finally.,"I bought this album a week before the opening night of their American Woman Tour to get myself in the mood for the show. I'm a big fan of the band, but until this album, was disappointed we didn't have a rarities album like other bands from that era. And now it's here..I gave the disc 4 stars, but that's really because the second disc in the set redeems the first. An interesting lok at the band in its renaissance after Chad Allen left, but aside from the odd Pretty Blue Eyes and the amazingly adept Sitar Saga, there isn't all that much spectacular stuff. Until disc 2. Starting with two versions of the Doors' Light My Fire, and rolling through a number of alternate versions of future album tracks, from These Eyes to 6am or Nearer, and a remarkable White Room, It really shows how the band grew into what we have today. This disc makes the set well worth it.A real Guess Who Fan needs this. If you aren't a huge fan, don't worry too much about getting it."
5,Product Feedback,"I really like this product,this is the 3rd case i have purchased,i especilly like the Lavender scent it makes you skin feel soft refreshing and clean.I have tried the aloe,it is good for the winter when your skin can get real dry from the cold weather."
2,Too Harsh for My Skin,This soap cleans well but was too harsh for my skin and private area. I also like a soap with less fragrance.
3,"Interesting reading, full of ideas, but devoid of depth","This book is a nice review of new findings in mathematical biology, and proves it's point: genes are not the only things capable of explaining biological phenomena. But it doesnt go further in any of the subjects it mentions, so the reader (be it biologist or mathematician) gets the feeling of inconclusiveness. Some more maths would be appreciated, since most potential readers are biologist with an interest en mathematical modelling, and have some foothold in the subject. Anyway, some points are remarcable, as the explanation to the Fibonacci series in plants. In conclussion, a good reading for someone needing some new ideas, and willing to do further bibliographical research."
2,RENT IT FIRST,"This game has 5 levels and you can't save at all and they're long and you do get checkpoints. All you do is run forward and shoot alians, no originality. You have futuristic weapons and you get powerups for them to make them powerful then when you're hit these pods fall out of you and you have to collect them back.Check outNinja GaidanGTA Double packMax Payne 1/2Dead to Rights"
4,"True, but........",All the reviewers are correct about the game being hard but i say who doesn't like a good challenge!! You need quick reflexes and exprience. Don't let this throw off over time you'll get the hang of it!! I strongly suggest you rent it before you buy it!
2,The good (?) old days.,"The book is well written and I enjoyed it when I bought it back in the 80's. I re-read it a few years ago and threw it away. I sort of wish I hadn't.If you're interested in how things were done years ago you might want to read this book but remember, there are reasons things are no longer done the way this book describes.One thing that stuck in my mind was the tremendous amounts of meats that many of the lifters ate. No need for steroids back then when you're consuming all of that steroid packed red meat.If you look at this from an historical perspective it's a great book to have. It has lots of good pictures of the old time greats. Don't base your beginning powerlifting career on the information in this book."
4,LOVE this Casio Watch!!,"I have bought this watch for more than 10 years. EASY to use, and the countdown feature is AWESOME! I HATE those watches with all the complex features; this once suits my needs perfectly! It lasts me 2-3 years. I went back to Wal-Mart today to buy another, and they stopped carrying them. I, too, would've given this watch 5 stars if it had a light feature. Otherwise, it's PERFECT. . .and I've never had any issues with it."
2,"The year is 2002, and I'm not impressed","I remember getting all excited when I ogt this, thinking this was going to to a great game. The cut scenes are kewl....gave a nice feel for the game. but play ability was frustrating. trying to aim and fire in the right direction was very frustrating...it was an okay game, but not worth [$$$]. Think they need to go back to the drawing boards for the next one, maybe even use the Halo engine."
1,Sorry... could have and should have been better.,"I bought this and the guide the day they came out as a big Terminator fan and 3rd person adventure fan. (1st person is tired) This game disappoints on every level. The control is bad and the gameplay is very unoriginal and repetitive. Don't waste your money here, go see T3 in the theaters and you'll be more satisfied believe me."
3,Big Screen - Tiny Buttons,"I like the large display. I wanted to be able to see the time without having to put my glasses on. The buttons for setting alarms and time are small. The alarm sound is big though; I wish I could lower the volume a little as it sometimes wakes the kids up down the hall. The button that shuts off the alarm is the same sliding button that turns on the radio: alarm on at the top, radio on at the bottom and off right above that. I have several times shut off the alarm only to be hit with the radio."
5,Another way to make money online just made easier,"Full of tips and techniques that will allow you to plug away from the beginning without having to spend too much time going from one site to another to learn a technique or two. Very useful and will help you put your internet business on auto pilot and start collecting small checks with minimal efforts. If you need another source of income, this is a great book to start with. I have used this book to market my business which shows you how to Cut a mortgage by 20+ years without adding to your monthly expenses. [...]"
3,Might Do Better Surfing the Web,"The AdSense Code provides about half a dozen simple good ideas on how to juice up AdSense ads on a website or blog. Most of the tips are available from the AdSense tutorial provided by Google. The few unique tips do help. I personally wouldn't recommend this book except to people who find it easier to read a book rather that read the online tutorial.One tip from the book is to make your AdSense ad look as much like your weblog as possible. People try to ignore ads and this way you may get more ""clicks"".I had already set up Adsense on my weblog, [...]and had chosen this look to begin with."
1,What an obvious DaVinci Code Ripoff,"Kind of like how I'd never marry a woman who left her husband to marry me, I don't think obviously ripping off the design cover of The DaVinci Code gives any creedance to the knowledge of this author. Might have been a decent concept if he had believed in his ideas well enough to differentiate. Since he doesn't and didn't, neither did I."
5,Excellent product~compact/environmentally friendly/economical,We bought this about a year ago....it is clean smelling and works great in our HE machine. Just a little goes a long way. One bottle lasts us about 4 months of 2 loads a week. No phosphates! Earth friendly! Cleans as well as anything we have used! I highly recommend!
4,"fun, frustrating and then fun again","I got this game for my 8 year old grandson and for me because I liked the movie more than he did. Once I started playing it I couldn't put it down. Some of the levels are fairly straight-forward, but not easy and the solar surfer levels are very very hard. Once you get to the last level they throw you a curve and the last threshold to the end of the game is not where you expect it to be. All in all a very challenging GameBoy game for an adult. Probably your average 12 year old gameboy kid could whip through it quickly but it took me a few hours each night for a week or so because I was enjoying the way it looks and the whole experience. Beautiful and very detailed in the same lush style as the movie."
3,Not impressed but Ok,This was better than the last (volume 3) But Ralphie sucked to me. He has never made me laugh. Seems as if they should have made a stronger comic as host. Alex and Joe were the funniest. I would give it a C- or D+
1,Best watch ever,"CASIO LA-670WA-1 ""Countdown"" Ladies Dress WatchOnly ladies watch I've found with all the features this watch has. I especially like the Countdown feature. When traveling the alarm and date are useful. I wear it 24/7 and buy a new one every 5-7 years - less expensive than changing the battery."
3,Terminator - The Fate of Wasted Money,"I thought I wrote a review on this already, but maybeI decided against wasting more of my time on this product.I'll make this quick. This game is OK at best. It'suninspiring and the only driving force to continue toplaying is to get it over with. I actually liked themost difficult part in which you have to fight aTerminator in both human-like and machine form, butthere was only one in the whole game. You've justgotta love those jacked up camera angles. Most ofthe time you're shooting at something you can't seeon the screen. Fortunately, this game is incrediblyshort, so the pain of thinking about the money youspent ... will go away quickly. I've gottaadmit, this CD does make a good coaster for my drinks.Don't buy it, rent it. If you don't finish it bythe time it's due back to Blockbuster, ""forget aboutit!"" It's not worth the late fee. Oh yeah, stay awayfrom ""No One Lives Forever"". ..."
3,Long Live Chagall Guevara !!!,"As a rebellious teen with no real sense of direction, I loved this film. I saw it in the theater a couple of times, and I bought the soundtrack to remind me of all the parts I liked. Time has a way of changing ones perspective, and so it has altered the way I look at this film, and the soundtrack. THis film and soundtrack make me nostalgic, but it hasn't stood the test of time.Most of the songs on this CD are forgettable. Concrete Blonde's Leonard Cohen cover is pretty good, but the real reason to pick up this near coaster of a CD is the album closer, ""Tale 'O the Twister"" by the late, great Chagall Guevara.Chagall Guevara made one album for MCA in the early 1990's, and then dropped from sight. This is a great non-album track that gives a glimpse of the greatness of what might have been, had MCA promoted the band properly. At any rate, I say to any and all BUY THIS RECORD!!! Chagall Guevara is dead; long live Chagall Guevara!!!"
2,What's wrong with Leonard Cohen?,"You know the song that starts out the movie, Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows,"" with that awesome deep voice that's all mysterious and stuff? It's not on the soundtrack. They have a cover by Concrete Blond... which isn't a bad band, and not a bad song, but it certainly isn't anything like Cohen's version. If you're going to put a cover of the theme song, at least put both of them on the sound track... the original and the cover. That's what I want. Is that too much to ask?"
4,A premature review to say the least,"I haven't actually listened to this CD as yet - but I am a HUGE fan of the movie. I'm a bit dissapointed to see a few tracks ommitted that would have made this CD excellent. Tracks by Ice-T, Beastie Boys, Butthole Surfers and the Descendents would have done just to the theme of the movie. You MUST see this movie."
3,not a bad buy,"If you analyze anything long enough, you can find problems with it. I agree that Leonard should have made it on the soundtrack and both versions would have been great (maybe bookend the soundtrack with both versions). I don't like it when producers set the movie to music and then screw up the soundtrack either. The disc sounds better if you've never seen the movie. Overall, I like it. Too bad the producers didn't take it seriously. They should take a good look at the Cohen Brothers and Wes Anderson movies."
1,Quilt book,I have not been very happy and haven't used this book much as almost all the blocks need a template and I am not that experienced yet and hate having to make one or more templates for each block.
2,Very disapointed,"Always loved these guys but age has taken it's toll...all the music has slowed down. Lake's voice is not what it use to be, Emerson's hands are no longer as dextrous, even Palmer's slowed down..I have great memories of ELP in their prime and that's how I choose to remember them."
5,Great Seller!,"Great Blu-Ray of ELP. Looked like an amazing show on blu-ray! Seller had the package shipped very fast, and durring the holiday at that. A++ Seller! Great blu-ray!"
2,Not Worth The Money,"I am a fan of their work. Their studio albums feature music that is well produced and dynamic when listened to on compact disc. The Blu-Ray version of their concert greatly lacks the visual quality one expects from the medium. The sound options are for 2.0 and 5.1 Dolby. Even when listened to via the 5.1 setting the sound was awful compared to the many other Blu-Ray concerts in my collection. Please rent this disc first if you can and then decide how much, if at all, you should pay to buy it."
2,poorer than I expected,"Poor audio, video is crisp, sound engineering was not done well and there is no vocal range or the originally quality is gone. Bass was booming even when Lake was playing it? I tried adjusting my 5.1 system but not possible to get a good sound and given today's technology it should have been easy. I am not a super fan but I especially like their their ballads which were either missing (such as Still You Turn Me On) or done poorly. The vocals on Lucky Man had to compete with the crowd, a good engineer would have cleaned it up."
4,Hoover Vacumn Extension Hose,"I ordered this hose to extend the reach of my upright vacumn. If unfamiliar with this hose, it is of a coiled variety and one must stretch it to achieve its advertised length. It does stretch although one has to pull on it which results in the vacumn having a tendency to tip. Not the easiest to use but it achieves the intended result."
5,Vac Bags,I received these vacuum bags but have not had a chance to use them as the new vac I bought had a bag in it.
5,Great Vacuun bag,"This is a very good vacuum bag at a very good price. It is the only way to purchase vacuum bags if you change your bags out frequently. I have ordered all of the Type Y bags Amazon has to offer and so far they all seem to preform the same, so I usually look for the best price at the time."
1,BEWARE -- may not fit your vacuum,Despite ordering Hoover bags for a Hoover vacuum these are larger than the type Y Hoover bags that fit in my Windtunnel vacuum and will not work. I even wrote Hoover customer service before ordering them to make sure there were not multiple sizes of type Y bags and got an email bag from them claiming there was not and that any Type Y bag would work. Now I have a bunch of news bags that won't fit and no idea how to find other bags that will since you can't trust the product description even when it is from the company that makes the vacuum.
1,Does not fix my vacuum.,"My Hoover Wind Tunnel Vacuum said to use Type Y bag so this is the reason I order it. When I receive the bags, they do not fix. Now I am stuck with bags I can not use. I do not have my receipt to return these bags. :("
1,product faulty,"Ordered these Hoover, Type Y replacement bags because generic replacement parts are often as good as manufacturer's items. This is definitely not so with these vacuum bag replacements. The price was right but the seam in the bag in the front came apart so it made the vacuum cleaner ineffective. I definitely will not buy them again."
5,"great price, great product",product came in on time. the bags work great. this is the second time i've purchased them. why spend all the money at best buy or sears to get a 3 pack when you can get all these bags for a great price?
4,KEEP IT IN THE BAG,"With bagless vacuums in the spotlight, having a vacuum that requires a bag and finding them in the store is not an easy task. I have tried bagless vacuums. Mine wasn't a Dyson. It's suction power was mediocre and emptying it in the trash didn't improve the air quality from my point of view. Replacing this bag is easy and keeps the dust from spreading all over the floor and around the trashcan."
1,Do not fit,I ordered these bags along with Hoover windtunnelmax vacuum. But they didn't fit. They are way too long.I wasted my money
5,Can only use one at a time,"Haven't had a chance to use these yet but they asked if I am happy with the service. All that can be said ""so far so good."""
3,Sweeper Bags,"These bags are the standard bags that you can get at Walmart, they are not what I expected as I was trying to get a bag like I got with my new Hoover which is a cloth bag. Seems to be unavailable except on the original purchase"
4,"Quick and easy, but sometimes bland","I bought this book looking for a quick and easy crock pot cookbook. And it is! All of the ingredients are very easy to find at your local supermarket. The recipes have virtually no prep time because a lot of the ingredients are pre-packaged, pre-cut, etc. So, if you enjoy ""true"" cooking, i.e. preparation and ""from scratch"" ingredients, this may not be the book for you. It is the book for busy people who want to enjoy the smells and flavors that a crock pot dish can create. I've tried several recipes in this book and have been satisfied with about half. Some are excellent (Beef Roast Excellente and Chunky Chili come to mind) and some are not good. The ""not goods"" don't taste bad, per se, but they are very bland (Chicken and Dumpling Casserole). Perhaps they could be made better with some experiments with different spices. Being a beginning chef, I did find this book pretty useful."
4,George Washington's Pursuit of Honor,"This in an excellent DVD that consists primarily of several reputable historians views of the background of George Washington that led to his acceptance of the awesome responsibility as Commander-in-Chief of the fledgeling American army. The views expressed by the historians cover the period from Washington's initial engagement in the French and Indian Was to his assumption of command of the American Army. Throughout this period Washington was engaged in honing his own image as a gentleman with impecable honor, and the code he lived by reflected that.I gave this DVD four rather than five stars because I was disappointed it did not cover the period of his youth and formative years, and the influence of that period and his home life that was the background for his character. This is an excellent DVD for all interested in the life of the Father of our Great Nation."
2,Give him time....,"The fact that Ryan is new to the DL saga is blatantly obvious in this tale. The story had some potential but as noted elsewhere, Ryan depicted the gnomes much differently than in any other book and thus completely missed the characteristic traits that make gnomes so enjoyable. The writing style is fairly good but much of the plot is illogical and under-defined(e.g. the paradise machine) I've read every book in the series thus far and this one definitely jumped out of context though it was still an acceptable read with some good moments."
1,Time to hang it up.,"I can honestly say that I believe the DragonLance well has finally run dry. This was the worst book that I have ever read. The concept of the Gnomes behavior was untouched upon in other books, and the concept of the Paradise Machine was total moronic. I agree with the review that said that Commander Khargos couldn't lace his boots without the help of the Dark Queen. A little research and planning would have made this book much better. So far the only good thing I can say is the line about Gully Dwarves being expendable (with expenadable supposed to mean brave) was very funny. One line however, can not save this book. Save your money. This one isn't worth it."
5,A refreshingly different Dragonlance book,"Well, I've read a few Dragonlance novels, and think this one isjust fine. All that gnomish preposterousness mixed with a bizarre andappealing plot (fully in line with gnomish character), and a genuine Irish flair for language. One of the better Dragonlance books I've read in a while: the character of the High Justice Gordusmajor is alone worth the price of the book!"
5,awesome,"this is my first jazz album, and it is awesome. I bought it because I heard the first track playing at a bookstore and had to have it. it's great, sets a mellow yet vibrant mood, great for dinner parties."
2,A big dissapointment!,"When I picked up my copy of this game [only for 9.99 at fye.com] I thought it might have some potential. I was wrong! Okay, lets start with the controls. Can be hard to learn! To bad you can't change them! Second, the graphics. You basicly get the same graphics from Turok: evolution! So, what I am saying is...they're bad! Horrible frame-rate! At one point in the game, the frame-rate completely froze up, forcing me to restart the WHOLE thing from scratch. Next, crappy save system. First off, checkpoints are WAY to far spread. In one level, there is only one checkpoint, and that was like halfway through the level! And the only way you can save your game without losing the data you have now is to save after you cross a checkpoint. Bad!! No multiplayer what so ever! The only good thing about this game is that the flying missions are kinda cool and that it is really gory! Cool weapons as well! Only rent!"
1,this game ...!,"this is by far the worst game i have ever played, and i have played some pretty bad games. i don't know how anybody could compare this piece of junk to HALO. the gameplay is awful. the gun graphics aren't bad, but the gameplay is what is important. your first mission is way too hard to be a first mission, and it takes an hour to finish. at one point you need to crawl through eight or nine vents. don't waste the money renting this game, and buying this game is out of the question. use the money you saved renting this game and rent a good game, like HALO or any other good shooter."
2,Pictured chair isn't the one they send,"The chair in the picture is not the one they send. Buyer beware. They sent a chair with no arm pads, mostly made of plastic, not steel. Does not match product description."
3,50/50,Lost mine and this is the replacement. I have 2 memory sticks to put in it and only one works. Better than none at all. Don't know if its the fault of the adapter or memory stick.
4,Works well enough,"This adaptor works well enough, just wish sony would get with the program and make cameras that work with the standard memory cards like everyone else."
5,"my life is saved, so to say","a couple of weeks ago, I had one which I always use to upload my pictures, but someday it just got lost and I was like ""miserable"" because I couldn't upload my photos and besides, I didn't have the regular USB cable, so imagine... Now that I got a new one, including a case (whick I love and it will help me not to lose it again), I'm happy again! It's so easy to use and you don't need to plug the camera with the computer, even in times when its battery is dead haha =P so, it's just taking the chip, put into the adapter and insert it into the laptop and voila!"
2,A great performance completely messed up in the mix,"This concert was a GREAT performance by B.B. to a wildly appreciative audience. I know, I was there. BUT when I first got the album, I was SO disappointed. The quality of the live recording is disappointing enough, but the instrumentation added in the studio (strings, percussion, etc.) completely undermines the feeling of the music. It's painful for me to listen to this album, knowing how good it COULD have sounded. Buy Live at the Regal and Live in Cook County Jail instead."
4,very well rendered,"I have had an opportunity to play this game, and it is very well done. I felt that for a platform game it has very good playability, better than many other movie tie ins, although sometimes the leap, fly and get mobbed by hordes of bad guys does get a bit old. However this game does compare VERY favorably to the attrocious Enter the Matrix. This is overall a fun game, and most of the cur scenes are very well rendered as to look almost life-like. Most I say because some revert back to in game level animation right in the middle of them."
4,Great game!,"This game is very entertaining and tells alot about Jangos past. The whole deal is that you are Jango Fett and are going to capture the leader of a cult called the bando gora. In order to like this game you have to like star wars alot. I am a complete star wars freak, so I loved it. The Bando Gora are very stubborn when it comes to killing them. It becomes very hard towards the end, so I suggest if you are not good at video games, do not buy it. You have to fight a jedi at the end, that is the hard part I was talking about. If you know Jango, he has the same weapons as he does in the movies, a flamethrower, a high flying jet pack, and of corse, the double pistols. You fight a wide varity of creatures including: a giant dragon. My favorite weapon was the flamethrower because it had wide kill radius and a one-hit K0 ability. The fire graphics were astounding. If you like star wars and like adventure games, then this is the game for you!"
5,Fett Family Tradition,"first of all from all the screenshots i saw and the review's I read, i imediatly wanted this game for christmas! who wouldn't want it!!! it has jango fett the father of boba fett in it as the main charecter, and you can play as the changeling zam wessel which is equally cool! some people may say don't judge a book by it's cover but i say ignore that phase and go for the game! buy buy buy! your children will love this game if they are star wars fans. ignore Star Wars Clone Wars and buy this exciting new game!-from a 14 year old gamer"
3,i recommend non-hard core star wars fans to rent first,"I played the game at my friend house then got it at a gamestop it was pretty good exept for the bando gora and the blood that comes out when u kill them.(use a flamthrower for banodo gora)the last leval named final confirmation vosa was not that hard but the rest of the game was hard the game had good gameplay(for vosa i recommend using your heavy blaster or keep firing dual blaster fast and run away on jet pack,but when she starts blocking thatswhen u have to wait for her to come up to u then just use your rope and tire her up and shot her fast) i recommend this game for 9 year olds though for other pepole please read my recommenddation at the top"
2,Lets ruin a good concept shall we Lucasarts?,"I got this game at my local Gamestop for $14.99 used, I had looked at the Amazon.com reviews, and they where good, I looked at the Gamespot.com reviews, and they called the game mediocre,and they where right, the games concept is original, and the weapons are cool, but the gameplay just doesn't follow through, part of the reason is its excruciating difficulty, I spent 45 minutes on one level, and the only level I really enjoyed was Corusant, because you felt like you where really a bounty hunter, and I had to use cheats to get to that level.This game could have been great, I mean come on what Star Wars fan Doesn't want to fly around as Jango Fett, collecting bounties before he gets his head cut off, the game needed many things, like difficulty settings, and being able to fly Slave 1.The animations are very well done, but the neatness of the weapons, and the animations where not enough to keep me from returning it."
5,Incisive and Entertaining Case Study,"New York and most every major city has been through some sort of stadium game of late. But no state has such a rich history of sports hijinks as Minnesota. Weiner does both an entertaining and informative case study of that would be interesting and enlightening for any fan, reporter or elected official in any city that has a franchise or is trying to lure one. Weiner shows that the games off the field are as fun to watch as the ones on."
5,Women's Contribution to the Armed Forces,This book describes the behind the scenes policy making contributions made to the Army by the women in the Women's Army Corps. It's a look at the strong women who made decision making changes to the Corps in order to modernize it's image. The changes the Corps had to endure in order to bring recognition of the important contributions made by women to the army even in the time of world conflicts. A must read for every women in the Army so they know the heritage and standards set forth by their precedors; the women of the Women's Army Corps.
1,What order??????????????,"The item was never delivered. First I got emails that it shipped. The next day I got an email saying it was backordered. I think they told Amazon it shipped and then it never shipped. NOW, I have to dig through emaails and credit card statements to deal with this. THANKS Amazon. This is the second lousy non-Amazon purchase I have made through Amazon in a row. I am starting to think buying from all these other vendors on Amazon is not only a waste of time but it burns extra time for me to fix it. Great. Just what I need to be doing in December.Why does Amazon deal with all these losers? I already went through the complaint process before with Amazon. I got nothing out of it."
2,Wilcox with an attitude!,"I own all of Wilcox's CDs, but this one is the most unique. It presents David on the edge, a musician with an attitude. These songs are less reflective, but showcase David's storytelling abilities. I would only recommend this one to die-hard Wilcox fans. It's not one for the faint of heart, or the easily offended."
1,May be the worst appliance I have ever bought - AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,"I started with a self-propelled bagged WindTunnel I. Loved it until it finally wore out. Went to a Dyson. Hated it and replaced within months with a WindTunnel 2. Hated it even more than the Dyson and have now replaced it with a self-propelled bagged WindTunnel I - which is wonderful.The ""new thing"" is awful. Bagless just means major mess. Just about every feature is clunky and difficult to use, and the hose placement is so poor that the hose often just flops around when you vacuum. I don't know what Hoover was thinking with this one. Awful, Awful, Awful."
1,Gold but only plated!!!,"This vacuum has all the bells & whistles, however the imbedded faults outweigh the positive aspects. The HEPA filter began clogging after the third use. Dust & dirt drops and scatters when the canister is removed. The canister screen must be cleaned during every waste dump. It's heavier than the cleaner we replaced. I'm within 30 days of the original purchase date and I am definitely returning. This vacuum is like going from HDTV to B&W. I will never try a Hoover again."
1,Dont Buy this Vacuum!!!,"I have own this vacuum for almost a year now and it has been in the shop to be repaired 3 times. The HEPA filter is completely clogged and Hoover will not replace since it is not covered by warrantee. The reason is t clogged is because the mechanism that is supposed to rotate it to clean it out has broken twice. Recently it would just not power up, so back to the shop again. Although when it works it does do a nice job on the carpets I would say use the money to by a Dyson it might be expensive but money well spent. This machine is poorly constructed and very heavy and difficult to handle. I own a 2700 sqft house that is half carpet, with 2 dogs and 2 kids. It gets used regularly but by no means daily. I cannot stress enough how horrible this experience had been. Please use sense and do not buy this vacuum."
4,great price great performance,"per all the other reviews, yes its a heavy bugger, but since we don't have stairs, thats not much of an issue. i think we can use a little more exercise anyway. amazing how much junk it gets up. it does take a little cleaning of the cup and filter area when you dump it, but thats pretty minor compared to the effectiveness of the cleaning. really like the magnets to hold the hose in tight (no extra hose looped around the handle, or hanging in the closet). hose really stretches out for long reach. seems much more solid so far, than some of the others we considered. wish the on/off was near the handle though."
3,Not totally satisfied,"The product is good but at the same time not so great. While using the product, it causes to spit out a lot of dust through the entire house. My son has started to have regular and on-going sniffles and it caused me to have a real bad sinus infection. The cup that holds all of the dust while vacumming doesnt secure all of the dust that's being sucked up. Instead, it releases a lot of dust in the air which caused the entire house to have dust while in use.In the beginning, I was totally excited to purchase this product but now, I'm regretting it. I'm not totally satisfied with what the product could do for me. It's just stored the closet now and not being used."
2,Hoover WindTunnel II,The windtunnel II is a poorly constructed vacuum. It is less than six months old and the motor for the HEPA filter had to be replaced. It is very messy when you have to empty the tank. Dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank.
3,I was surprisingly let-down...,"If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would. Let me say, when Samurai 7 is good, it's GOOD. But it's more 'meh' most of the time. It's just a lot of mixed episodes really start to get thrown on halfway through.Through disks 1-4, it's great. Slowly building up, can't stop watching feeling, it's wonderful. But after that... it's like it got dropped. Went downhill FAST. I was surprised, considering how well the show was building up. You'll be like... '...uh, really?... what?' It just catches you off guard how out of no where it doesn't continue to follow through with how well everything sets up.I would say, definitely give it a watch. If you HAVE to own anything samurai, might be worth buying, but otherwise check out other anime. There is definitely anime out there that is better than this."
5,You know you're in for when there's 7 of them.,"Samurai 7 set you back when the it's near the end of the samurai era. Where technologies help a man surpass himself. A few years after a massive war, the bandits, with their new ""upgrades"", have been terrorizing many villages. One village finally had enough of the pain and suffering, had their water priestess, with her little sister and a fellow villager, go the city in hope to hire a samurai to end the bandits terror. Witness what happens when she brings back seven, will these seven samurais succeed ? or will their individual quirks kill each other ? Can they even work together ? And what if the opponents were never really the bandits ?"
3,Fun the first time,"Great playability the first time through, but it gets monotonous and boring after that. You can't really become much of a sith in this game, for that try Kotor 2, but even then its lacking."
3,A good plot but not tested enough,"I had trouble with my game. I first bought it and then brought it home . The man who sold it to me told me that the game had glitches but i didnt care. I was so excited abut the brand new star wars edition Ididnt listen. I opened it up and put it in my xbox. It seemed to work fine. But as i got to the selection screen, it went blank. I did this over and over for 12 times but it didnt work. afetr that it was a good game. The plot and set up was excellent. the sound and graphics too. Once again the man told me that alot of the games were giched but you could go on with out any gliches. I guess Raven didnt test it enough."
3,"A alright game, with no replay value.","I thought this game was alright, but beat it too fast and wasn't fun playing it again. Not only that, but you don't evan get to controll your charictar in battle."
4,sometimes you just wanna strangle....,"Visually beatiful.Incredibly Moving.A little cumbersome.When the big monster ate my spaceship and the dog was like whoa it was awesome. I don't know a lot about starwars, but i know they make a great game. Half way through the game when i realized i was falling to the darkside, i was scared to find that i liked being evil, and i had no trouble putting to used the force on innocents in my way.All around this game is great! Giving you a chnace to choose your own great destiny. The only drawback, is that after the amazemet of being able to fry a twi'lek inside out subsides, combat looses its shine and becomes cumbersome. but its not bad enough to keep you from playing it through again to save the galaxy and be a hero. just keep your wookie happy, they can be a pain when they're grumpy."
4,Best Game in Xbox so far!,"I started playing video games many years ago on PC. The first day I played Stars Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, I was hooked! This is the second game (first being the ""Krondor"" series on PC) I've played that made me feel like I was in their world! Lots of emotion!Since my husband and I play, we notice there are differences to storylines due to the gender of our character. We put in about 50 hours of gameplay each. We've only played as ""light-siders"" so far and will probably be even more different leaning toward the dark side.The interaction with the other set characters is excellent. You are able to choose what you would say to someone from a list of dialogue and the dialogue was the funniest I have ever heard! There's even a little romance in it!In conclusion, I recommend buying the Xbox for this game!"
5,Best game yet for the xbox,"It's so great in every way; Characters,plot, graphics, and sound. THE VOICE ACTING IS BETTER THAN IN THE LAST MOVIE! It's the best game yet for the xbox."
5,The best star wars game ever,"This is the best star wars game ever and the best role playing game ever, the fact that you can go light side or dark side is great, the game is very fun and addicting. I played it twice, light side and dark side although the game stuck on me at the end on dark side and it would not let me reboot so I did not get to see the ending on dark side I only hope the next game will have better graphics and fewer bugs. This is a great game and comes highly recomended!"
4,One of the best games in years,"This is one of the best games I have played in years. The closest I can compare it with is directing your own movie. Well worth the price, but only if you can spare the hours to play it, as the game is adictive."
1,Will be terrible! For sure!,"I'm sure this game will be junk when it is released. I never thought any of the lucas arts games were that good. Some were even the worst games I ever played. Star Wars Jedi Outcast was the last straw. It convinced me not to buy star wars games again, or even waist $5.00 to rent a Star Wars game. I rather swim in a pile of puke than have this game in my home."
1,Disgruntled Star Wars Fan,"This game was fun, but now I've fought the same battle again for the 105th time and to be honest, now I'm sick of the game. It has an interesting storyline, but I don't understand why they needed to make some battles next to impossible to win. And this is still fairly early in the game, on Tatooine. Perhaps they do this so it will take longer to win. But I'd rather have it longer because of a longer story line, not because I've had to fight the same battle over and over again ad nauseam."
3,"gee, Star Wars","God, how many Star Wars video games are on the market today? There's gotta be more than a hundred, and most of them feature nearly the same light saber-slashing combat that the previous games did, only with slightly better graphics than the last time. It's time to end this silly sequel fascination and bring Star Wars to a close in the world of video games."
4,Very good game and worth owning (or renting 4 times).,"I was a bit skeptical before I played the game, however it kept me playing it all night. This game's appeal does not really stem from the action but rather the storyline and options. Unlike most role playing games, you have the option of picking your character, his/her appearance, and stats. As you play the game, 90% of the dialog depends on your choice of words to say, and every (and I mean EVERY) event revolves around your conversations. The scenery graphics also captures the beauty of each world. The cons of the game, the attacks become repetitive and there is a small limit to how far you can level up. Other than this, this game should be owned (Chrono Trigger fans would understand)."
4,Give it time!!!!!!!,"I swear I almost returned this game after playing it 15 min!!!I was so dissapointed... with the fighting most of all.. but i did not buy it for the fighting I thought(...)so I stubornely gave it a go. after an houre I felt a little better after 2 I was still not that impressed so I began working towards the sith side and after a while i was having a blast!!! especially when i got my hands on a lightsaber! boy its the best non trade I ever made!It starts out slow for some of us, but you will be rewarded with one of the better x-box games out there. at least till the BIG 4 show up.HALO 2!!DOOM 3!!! scarry you guys!!!FABLE !! its supposed to be better than kotor!HALF LIFE 2!!! for MANY part one is the best PC game ever...these games are gonna kick serious(...)!"
5,A Classic RPG,"A great game, with a great balance of Action, Story, and Strategy.To me, this game should be lumped into the set of ""Essential RPG Experiences"" list along games like ""Chrono Trigger"", ""Final Fantasy 6 (FF3 for super nintendo)"", ""Parasite Eve"", ""Dragon Warrior 4"" e.t.c.There is plenty of variety and challenge to make this game great for multiple playthroughs, and provides strong replay value as opposed to most games out there.This game works on the Xbox 360 console. If you have a connection to Xbox Live, (and a gold membership, I think) then you get a bonus area as a free download where there is a shop with some extremely powerful gear."
1,Boooo-rinng!,"Did I miss something? I'm at a complete loss as to how this game has been receiving such rave reviews. I agree with the other reviewer: the ""game"" consists of walking ten feet, meeting an NPC, then interviewing them with what seems like an endless (and mostly pointless) conversation. Then you walk another ten feet, meet another character, and start all over again. Occasionally, you run into someone you have to attack, but the combat is so boring that it makes watching a bunch of senior citizens playing golf look like extreme sports. Simply hit ""yes"" when asked if you want to attack, and then just sit and watch, and hope your complete lack of participation somehow affects the outcome. So join the excitement of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Talk! Then, talk some more! Then, fight by pressing ""X"" (once). Then, talk yet again! Don't just do something, stand there!"
4,A dream come true.,"It's a whole box set of Hanoi Rocks! If you're a fan you'll be ecstatic to hear the b-sides and demos. Even if you've heard them all before the remastered versions of everything are worth the price of admission.If you're new to Hanoi then it's still not a bad place to start, has a good cross section of their career though I could have maybe done without the last disc of post Hanoi bands. Some of it's good but really that's not why you're buying a Hanoi Rocks set now is it?Please note this doesn't contain any of the new millennium reunion line-up tunes. Which is fine because although that stuff is really good, it seems like a strange idea to mix the old and new since it really is a whole (mostly) different band. So I'm glad this set concentrated on the 80s era only.Enjoy!"
4,"Blinky, but serviceable","There are led's for each of the 7 ports - all different colors - that glow brightly when a device is plugged in. There is a center cluster of led's that blink and throb seemingly randomly, making the hub seem like it belongs on a Christmas tree rather than on your desk. The power and incoming usb port is on one of the short sides of the unit, and the incoming usb port is of the mini-usb style. It comes with a cable that was slightly too short for me (about 4-5'). Functionally, it works great with my Mac; it's just that the blinking and lights can be a little distracting, especially at night if you don't want to unplug the hub when you go to sleep."
1,"Disco Light only, no USB functionality","I bought this and connected it to my Mac which reads it correctly in About This Mac-More Info as a USB hub. Nothing that I connected would work correctly. I tried a scanner, printer, keydrives, iPod dock, keyboard & mouse. Some of the equipment showed up as being recognized but no data could be transferred.Also, as mentioned in previous reviews, the device has a rediculous amount of blinking colored lights which work much better than the USB functionality. If you're going after the disco light, great product. If USB hub is what you need, STAY AWAY."
2,"Flimsy, poor reception","My experience was different than others leaving comments here. First, the way the Airplay attaches to the iPod is flimsy and insecure. The slightest touch while playing results in static and sometimes complete loss of signal. Second, the reception in my car is lousy. I have an XM Roady that operates on an FM frequency with perfect reception. The Airplay, in the same vehicle and on the same frequency, gives dismal results."
2,Why does it only display even-numbered radio stations?,"I bought two of these...one works great, but the other did not. It would only display even numbered radio stations to connect with and the car only has odd numbered radio stations. I returned it and ordered a new one and the replacement one is the same way! Very frustrating!!"
4,their best yet:),"I love their new cd, its fresh, new, with a honky tonk jive that few can get. plus they have a beautiful love ballad w/ reba in ""if you see him/her"" and i think ""husbands and wives"" is great. awesome for two steppin. all around great cd. i loved it."
5,Perfect fit and performance.,Denso is the OEM for the original and they have even improved the original with this latest O2 sensor.If you are going to replace an O2 sensor be sure to to prepare in advance by spraying the bolts with PB Blaster at least 24 hours in advance. It was still a pain to remove the old rusted off nuts but once that was done this product went right in with a perfect fit and connected directly to the original electrical connector.
4,For a Science project,"We purchased this stuff to compare with the organic way to collect oil from the ocean after a spill. We found that using hair not only carries much more oil, but because is totally natural, we can prevent pollute when trying to clean."
4,Great character development,"I was up way too late last night reading this book. It was both enjoyable and well-written. The author does a wonderful job of character development for the most part (definitely with Vida and Peter, thought Tom could have used a little more fleshing out). Various scenes also seemed so real - the dialogues in Vida's classroom and her private thoughts and reactions as a teacher, the party scene with Peter and his adolescent insecurity. I will look for more books from this author."
2,"Entertaining, but trite and predictable.","I was excited to read this one because it received some really good reviews. I was very disappointed. An easy read, but it was extremely predictable and I found that I really didn't like most of the characters. And it wasn't like I ""didn't like"" them in a good way. This one was a real bummer."
3,These reviews on the Lost,"I find it very amusing how people can sit here and write reviews on games that haven't even hit the stores yet. No one here know what hell looks loke, not even I. How can you sit here and say it is more horrific than what's displayed in the game if : 1. No one has theoretically gone to hell and returned to tell about it and 2. the game hasn't even come out in stores yet? Society along with the bible project this certain aspect of how hell is when no one has ever been there and returned to tell about it. Not to put the bible down but Relying on someone's translation of hell is kinda crazy in itself."
2,Albertosaurus,I've liked the model but It has a little defects on your painting. It makes me crazy! The scale is perfect and your face is scary! Awesome!
1,"Fantasy yes, Historical accuracy a bit far fetched.",I find the idea of wireless communication in 1805 maybe possible. Portable voice wireless communication similar to a cell phone implausible. When I arrived at an electric kettle I decided this tale was one of sheer fantasy. If you don't have a background in science you may enjoy this book. Personally I prefer a little more accuracy in my reading.
5,A GREAT Reminder of his '98 Tour,"I attended his concert in Portland, OR last August and this CD is a great sampling of what he played outdoors that very warm evening. It was one of the best concerts I have ever attended. It was unbelievable how many people, young and old, were dancing and singing to every song. It was an incredible experience and I'm very glad to have the Premonition CD."
4,Almost Saturday Night,"To the reviewer who asked about ""Almost Saturday Night"" - yes, it is indeed a John Fogerty tune off his 1975 album. Dave Edmunds had a minor hit with a cover version in the 80's. In my opinion, this version on Premonition is the best take on the song.Strangly enough, a similar thing happened with ""Rockin' All Over The World"" also off of Fogerty's 1975 album. The British band Status Quo had a hit with their cover version and many people think they wrote the song. For you trivia fans out there Status Quo were the first band to play during Live Aid and they opened with, you guessed it, ""Rockin' All Over The World."" Hurray for Fogerty."
5,He still has it,"Having seen J.C. perform twice in the last 9 months in N.Y./N.J., I can categorically confirm that age has not dulled his great talent. Particularly special in his live concerts is the track ""I put a spell on you"". He does and this CD confirms it."
2,If this book was a car...,"it would be a tan 1982 Dodge K car.So far the recipes I have tried, and most that I have read, have been some bland stuff. Little taste in most of the recipes, and little to be excited over. I don't see how people could rave over this slop."
3,Recipes are okay,"The recipes are quick and easy, but they tend to use a lot of the same ingredients - chicken, rice, noodles, etc. There are also not a lot of vegetables involved and I love vegetables. If you're a ""meat and potatoes"" kind of person, though, the you'd probably like the recipes. I prefer the AHA low fat, low cholesterol cookbooks even though the recipes take a bit longer. There's more variety."
1,Just trying to level set,"Just trying to set some realistic expectations. I am very interested in this game, but the two guys who gave it 5 stars KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THE GAME! Please don't give a game 5 stars if you've never played it!"
1,Horrible.,"I feel that everyone is being a bit too nice with their reviews. I did enjoy the first book of this series, it was interesting, so I moved on to the second. What complete and utter dribble, I cringe when I pick it up, hoping that it will get better. Here are my problems with it:1) Boring. 2) No character development. 3) So many parts that make you say... ""huh? What is the author talking about."" 4) Almost redundant situations. ""Oh, look, I popped into a new world again, I'll go this way to get out! Yep, I was right again!""Im almost done the book but I don't think I can read another paragraph, so its going away for good. I will not even bother reading another book in this series. ...."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I liked the first book of the series, but this one just went on and on without doing anything. The characters weren't thought out at all... for example, our four heroes, close friends since childhood, are separated when their ship is wrecked at sea. We go over fifty pages before any of them say ""hey, I hope the others are okay..."" and they NEVER get around to saying ""hey, I hope the hapless unnamed sailors on the ship survived, even though I know they are the fantasy equivalent of Star Trek Red-Shirted Security Guards...""Don't waste your time. Read ""Game of Thrones"" instead."
2,Seemed to be the same as the first book in the series.,I enjoyed the book inasmuch as I can like a book which is the same as one I have already read. Several details also seemed to be missing or glossed over in the second book.
5,Excellent story line and adventure,"Drake spins a multi-level/multi-character tale balancing honor&goodness against pure evil. His characters are well thoughout and unfold superbly. The story line intertwines and I found the book difficult to put down. An excellent fantasy with wizard, kings, princess's, demons, undead,... etc. Can't wait until book 3 of the ""Lord of the Isles"" is released."
2,Bad Graphics,I was hoping to have a good sports car game but this is more of a soap opera than anything. The graphics are arcade like and more PS one looking. The control of the car is unrealistic.
5,im seeing stars tonight...,"i am such a huge amy millan fan. from broken social scene, to her solo release, she is a pure genius. the band stars, well what can i really say. it warms the heart, and creates dreams, passion, desire, and creativity. many people have labeled them a pop band, but what i find truly interesting is the fact that their slower, not poppy songs are ones with many many layers of distinct talent. my favorite song on this album is look up. it is a beautiful song, that displays amy millans talented voice like no other. in fact, as far as indie music goes, this is one of the best ive ever heard. coming in at around the same place is calander girl from stars' other ablbum ""set yourself on fire"". do they make pop music? yes they certainly do. but it is so much more than that, and you need to listen close, and to all of their songs because you may be missing out on the creation of this genius group of people. highly recommended album/band."
5,Worth reading.,"I thought this was a good book as far as understanding what is in the mind of Buffet. I do not follow him religiously like some so this book gave good insight on what type of human and investor he is. This is a Warren Buffet exam cram book. Warren is a very real person. You will not see people like him everyday. Buy this book based on this premise alone. After reading I think you will agree that this man is special, not just for his investing knowledge but as a human being."
4,Well Written,These books are so well written. The characters are fleshed out and you can keep up very easily with how they think. I'm a little in love with Max I think. The odd moments that don't feel right are few and far between so these are very easy to read. I'm hoping for many more in the series for me to enjoy.
5,Excellent for a niche audience.,"This should be on the shelf of every polyamorous person out there. I have only positive things to say about a book that speaks to me in a unique way. I'd read a sequel and I think that similar characters would make a great web series.While criticism about the writing quality is fair for the average reader, I find the writing to be very punchy. It's very easy to glide over dialogue that feels a little cornball or moments of absurdity, comedic flights that land with a thud. The situation is fresh and the characters develop an unconventional family that is story satisfaction."
3,An early effort on Strengths-based organizations...,"Donald O. Clifton is more recently the co-author of ""Now Discover your Strengths."" Soar with your strengths is obviously an earlier version of that book without the web-based testing or defined ""themes"". ""Soar"" has the stories and suggestions behind the data found in ""Now Discover"". Nothing new here, but the stories may help those who struggle with the concepts in ""Now Discover"". I particularly liked the rabbit story at the beginning (which I empathized with) and the suggestions at the end of the book about imagining your goals and dreams.Again, nothing new here, but some really nice illustrations of material found in other books."
5,Long Way Round Long Way Down Race to Dakar,All 3 of these sets are really fun and amazing to watch. If you are into motorcycles it is a must to see.
1,The discs are in PAL format,"They don't work in my DVD player because I'm in North America. Why would they send these to anyone in North America?Stupid me, I didn't open them right away because I was busy, and now it's too late to return them, so I'm hosed. Buyer beware."
3,Go [rent] for this one,"This is a fun game with a nice movie tie in, but do not buy this game, RENT it. I got it for Xmas and solved it in about 8 hours of total game play. Don't get me wrong, I really like this game, but [$$] for 2 days of fun is way too much."
4,didn't live up to name,"I am huge starwars fan, and this game was second rate. This was a fun game and all, but it only took me 5 hours to beat on the hardest setting, jedi master. Get this game if you want too, it will probably take a few hours to beat it. When you first get this game you expect to play as the clones and plot out attacks and [stuff] like that, but no, you play as a jedi, like in almost every...starswars game. The animation is eehh, they mostly foucesed on the vechiles. The only person that looks like the real thing is Obi-Wan. As my title says, this game doesn't live up to its name."
2,Star Wars Clone Wars,"My 10 year old must have thought this was something different. He has not played with it much and said he does not like it. He has several other star wars games, not sure why, but this does not interest him."
2,Not Feeling It,I got this for Xmas and I can't get into. It's extremely hard to hit and extremely easy to field. All the bells and whistles for extras are nice but I found the game play difficult on the offensive end and too easy defensively. Perhaps I should spend more time w/it but I think I'll wait for a newer improved baseball game...
4,GrillPro 60090 good rotisserie and now it fits,"I have a Huntington gas grill. Huntington and Grillpro are brands from the same parent company, Onward Manufacturing. Onward customer service advised that the 60090 rotisserie would fit my grill. When I received the rotisserie, the bracket for mounting the motor prevented the grill from closing fully. I sent pictures to Onward customer service and received an alternate bracket. Now the rotisserie mounts perfectly. Rating updated from 3 to 4."
2,Not as good as other reviews,"Unfortunately I must say this rotisserie is really well made on his parts, all except the motor. Mine did not work out of the box!. Also I must say the Universal part does not fit for the Fiesta Blue Ember 3-Burner Gas Grill Model #FG50069. No way to match without doing modifications and including additional parts.In Conclusion if motor have worked and If I have owned another brand/type of grill, then I could be really happy.Amazon Service Desk was great as usual, the offered 30% discount or full replacement."
3,"Not Really ""Universal""","Was what I was looking for and had great reviews but it did not fit my grill, so I am saying that it is not really Universal as advertised. No problem returning it though and that went fine, even though I am out the shipping costs."
1,Comprehension Problem,"This is not my kind of book. It was riveting to begin with as the main character is puzzled by his mysterious mother, but once the Victorian ghost tales began infiltrating the story, I lost interest... it was just a bit much for me to keep track of fictitious characters within several different layers of narrative. By the time I reached the final chapter, the puzzling ending was irrelevant to me because the whole story was just too obscure. There are a lot of descriptions of the construction and layout of the various rooms of the big house at the end that all begin running together. Rarely do I skim through paragraphs so carelessly, but I really wasn't much concerned anymore with figuring out what was going on."
4,An almost perfect ghost story,"If not for the ending this superb contemporary ghost story would be worthy of five stars. I haven't read such a compelling, suspenseful, literary chiller in a very long while. As other reviewers have stated if this type of story (a sophisticated ghost story very much in the Victorian tradition), is your thing then you will certainly find this novel ""un-put-downable"". The mix between the narrative and the insertion of the haunting and connected ""stories"" is superbly crafted, rarely have I seen it done better. As many other reviewers have already stated, the ending was not up to par with the rest of this story. The author did not do this story justice by finishing his novel with such a hurried, confusing, let-down of and ending. If nothing else you should read this story just for ""The Revenant"" alone, that one will stay with you for years. 4.5 stars."
3,Have to agree with many others...,"I won't waste time repeating the sentiments I've already seen in many other reviews - great read, disappointing ending, you get the idea. In defense of the author, I think that maybe the ending is supposed to be ambiguous...unfortunately the fact that it was intentional doesn't mean that it works here. The story just feels hacked-off, not invitingly mysterious when you read that last paragraph.It's not that the ending is entirely open-ended, either. The major plot twist is indeed explained. As some reviews have pointed out, many people will have that bit worked out long before the final chapter. It's more the intricate details of what REALLY happened ""that night"" and who was responsible for what that are left foggy. A few ambiguous comments are made on the subject but these could be interpreted in a number of ways. Unfortunately these details are what builds the intrigue of the story, and leaving them hanging only leaves the reader hoping for more."
4,Great...but ending a little off,"This book was great for those who love a good ghost story that will honestly scare you into sleeping with the lights on....at least that's what it did to me. At the end though, something was missing. I was left with the feeling that I was now missing a few pieces of the manuscript just as the character found so many times that he was missing a few pages to all his stories. Like so many other reviews, the ending left a damper on this book for me too."
3,so good and then so bad,"everything aside from the final 5 pages of this book is spot on. the book builds tension and scares, it manages the delicate trick of narrative and inserted stories, it maintains interest with a superb drip feeding of information....then it muffs it all up with a final scooby doo ending. worth a read but throw it away before the last few pages"
3,"Almost great, but...","I loved the first 100 pages or so of this book. The stories within the novel are fabulous! I almost would have preferred to see this as a collection of Victorian-style ghost stories. They are written in a way that actually gives the reader chills (and I usually don't like those kinds of stories). I loved the idea of these stories integrating themselves into the lives of the characters of the novel. Great, great concept. As the book went on, though, I found myself so caught up in the stories (some of which were very long or stopped and restarted later on)that I couldn't follow the novel storyline as well as I would have liked. By the end, I was just really confused and disappointed. I hyped this book up to my friends early on, and now, after finishing it, I don't know if I would recommend it or not. I definitely liked the author's writing style and would pick up another book of his if I were to come across it."
2,Not what I was expecting!,"I'm new to scary novels but have been a devoted scary movie buff all my life. I like stories that involve hauntings,big creepy houses, etc. But this book was just not that intersting... in fact, it was kind of boring. It lost me at the part where the woman is in the library or ""reading room"" and she becomes surrounded by fog and then is chased by a doll like creature with the clicking open and shut eyes. Pleeassse! That's not suspenseful or frightening, just idiotic. I agree that the writer shows promise and has a delicate and sensetive style- an ability to paint pictures, but the pictures he paints aren't worth the look. I'm anxious to see what this writer produces in the future. He shows promise. This story could have been so much more."
5,A ripping good read,I found this book absolutely un-put-downable. The author's use of language is first class and his weaving together of several strands to a spine-chilling conclusion seamless. I rated this book as far and away superior to Byatt's Possession (to which it was unfavouably compared by another critic). I hope that Harwood will produce many more such masterpieces.
4,A first-rate blues album,"This is a great album. Colin Linden is a supremely talented singer and songwriter, as virtually every track here proves. The best songs are ""Raging River"", a haunting, evocative track, and ""George Chuvalo"", a moving tribute to the legendary Canadian boxer. If you like Linden, I also recommend his album ""South at Eight, North at Nine"", or, if you want an overview of his career, ""Sad and Beautiful World"", a compilation recently released in Canada."
1,Great Concept....bad game,"As much as I loved the concept of the game (being able to control every aspect of a modern war) I would have to say I would have appreciated playing this game on a PC more than on my PS2. Why?Simply because of the controls. You have to memorize a VERY large amount of command functions before you can play fluidly at all. You have the normal buttons as one command, then you can you use those same buttons as another command if you use another button to shift it first. Then you can use the command buttons again only if shifted again by another button. With the PS2 controller already having 8 oft used buttons I don't want to memorize 24 different command combinations or even 16. I have enough games where I have to have the buttons memorized."
1,Conflict Zone - Modern Crap!!,Let me start out buy saying that this game is not worth buying at any price. Its terrible graphics its boring play its just plain bad. There is nothing fun or challenging about it. The only challenge is why would you buy such a pice of crap. Do not even bother listing to anybody else that says its ok or great its not. Its a complete waste of time and money. A must avoid game.
4,The Pampered Chef Limited Edition Cheese Knife (No Longer in Catalog),It was what my daughter was looking for as I have one already...and now we are looking for a Pampered Chef Coarse Grater.It handles well and is diswasher safe.
1,Watch Out!,"If you are going to consider taking the stuff of this Title, tell the doctor that suggests it that you know of at least one person who is covered in violently itching/painful rash and welts all over his back, ankles and upper arms four days after ceasing ingestion of this stuff, having only taken one pill a day for five days, with the rash still spreading as I write this."
2,"Ho, Hum.","This game is really fun, for about the first 30 minutes. You quickly come to the realization that once you've played the four or five available games you've basically seen it all. Sure you can choose different characters and different weapons, and different teamates, but it doesn't really change anything. As a rental game Unreal Championship is worth a weekend rental, but if you buy it you will be stuck thinking about what else you could have done with that $$."
3,The biggest letdown ever,"Most of us who are into deathmatch games such as Counterstrike and Halo have been waiting for this game since we heard about it. We've talked about it, dreamed, and couldn't wait for it to come out. Then when it does, it's a huge letdown. They should have just remade the original UT and put it on Xbox. It seems things have been taken away instead of added to the game, the biggest reason I call this a let down.It's a lot faster then Halo, so people who play Halo like mad over a LAN (like me) needed a few minutes to get used to the speed of the game, but even then, the game just didn't seem as good. Even over a LAN, it doesn't even compare to Halo. You HAVE to play against bots, even if theres a lot of people, you can't customize the bot skill, you can't customize the bots.Bottom line, rent it before you buy this one, if you like it then buy it. Don't waste... on it from the start, I'm not the only one who said this game... compared to Halo."
4,Looks good-very similiar to UT2003 for the PC.,"On the XBOX, UC looks awesome. With blazing graphics in your face, great audio, Advanced AI, and the same ol' UT/UT2K3 gameplay UC looks like it's gonna be a hit on the xbox-and XBOX live helps it big time! UC basically looks the exact same as UT2K3 for the PC, but just with different characters and maps. I do have UT2K3 for the PC, and I wasn't impressed by the game-play and weapons. Also, the weapons look similiar in UC as they do in UT2K3. Yet, my PC wasn't quite powerful enough to render UT2K3 with an high amount of detail and effects + high resolution at a fast paced smooth frame-rate. I expect UC on the XBOX to be a hit. A big one. And this may be the best multiplayer death-match mode game on the XBOX!!(of course I own an XBOX myself...) Look out Unreal fans, because here comes out of nowhere a whole new whoopin' unreal title for the XBOX!! =]"
2,Single player mode is boring,"This game had little to offer in the First-person shooter (FPS) genre. The graphics are pretty mediocre and the AI is nothing fancy.The single player mode lacks any sort of story or development. The different game modes, while generally fun, are nothing new. The controls are pretty good, but the action moves a little unrealisticlly (no pun intended). Weapons don't require reloading, so the action seems a bit over-exagerated.I haven't played this game on x-box live, so I'm passing no judgment in that respect. But as a FPS, this game suceeds in breaking no new ground. Nor does it really push the limits of x-box's potential."
1,"there was so much hype, for nothing","Never compare this game to halo. This game bored the hell out of me. I bought it for xbox live. Played it for a couple of hours, and traded it in for mechassault. I tried really hard to like this game, but the more I played it the more I hated it. If you are interested at all in this game, go out rent it first."
2,"Good game, but still lacking","Rented the game, had a good time with it. Bought the game, bored with it. Graphics are done very well, but still graphics can only go so far. Not to much to do after you beat it and demolish your opponents online. It would have been cool if it had all of the options of HALO's multiplayer mode, and the maps were bigger."
3,"If you're a PC gamer, DO NOT GET THIS","If you're not a pc gamer, you may like it. I've been playing unreal tournament on the pc since it came out, so i was curious to see how this would play on a console. Major letdown. The game is slow, graphics are so-so, and the customization is non-existant.I'm just glad I rented it before I bought it. You should consider doing the same."
2,Not all that Natural,After reading the bottle I assumed Ivory was all natural minus dies and perfumes but they do have them may I am getting confused with dove. But I was dissapointed in that
2,Not ivory I know,"Nothing more but a comment on the smell - I thought it would smell like the bar soap Ivory, but it doesn't. I even smelled it before bought it. However, after a few uses, I realized it doesn't. To me, and I'm probably in the minority on this, but it smells a teeny bit like body odor!"
2,Mine became a fire hazard,"I've owned a 1 to 1 coffee maker for around 6 months and was quite pleased with it until a couple of weeks ago when I noticed whisps of smoke emerging from the back. I unplugged it immediately and contacted the manufacturer, who promised to send me a replacement unit and issue a UPS call tag to pick up the defective machine. It's been 2 weeks and no replacement has arrived. Just to be sure I wasn't seeing steam, I plugged the machine in again (with a fire extinguisher at the ready). Sure enough, I hurt a ""SIZZLE"" and the smoke emerged once again, along with an acrid burning smell. When I asked the Melitta customer service rep if they were aware of any problems with the ""1 to 1"" I was told ""No, that's why we would like to have this one back so we can see what happened."" They may be concerned, but not concerned enough to get me a replacement machine in a timely fashion."
4,Great Little Brewer,"This is a great Machine. No Leaks, no problems. Makes an excelent cup of coffee or tea in a flash. The only problem for me is the coffee. All coffee & tea is an individual taste, but the coffee that came with this machine was not worth drinking. I found both Folgers and Millstone to taste much better. Pods from Millstone & Folgers are actually made for the Senseo, but fit with a little persuasion.The tea that Melitta provides gets a great for two out of three. The Black tea tastes straight from Lipton, but the other two are really good.The biggest problem is that Most pods from other manuyfacturers are made for the Senseo, but they do fit. I am willing to try a few more flavors, but cannot recommmend any of the Melitta Coffees."
1,Disappointed,"I wanted to make one fresh cup of coffee in the mornings before work. I have been heating up coffee from a full pot I make about twice a week. I thought this would be the answer to a good cup of coffee in the morning but, I am sorry; I do not like the coffee. I red all of the reviews and thought I made an informed decision when I bought it. The coffee is week and does not fill a ""Coffee Mug"". I like French roast and did buy the French roast pods and tried two different brands. I think if I used 3 pods for one serving, it might be ok, but is that cost effective? Plus it takes 1 and to 2 servings to fill a ""Coffee Mug"". And then the unit is as big as or bigger than a normal coffee pot. Wow, all this for one simple cup of coffee. I went out and bought a small one cup coffee maker with an insulated cup at Big Lots for 9.99 that includes a permanent filter. I used a non-brand French roast from the grocery store and am very happy. Plus it is smaller!"
4,Super Croc is worth the purchase,"I bought these for my son who is 5 and a dinosaur fanatic! He loves Super Croc however dinosaur hunter is about the actual digging and looking for dinosaurs, he really isn't that interested in that, maybe when he gets older. But for real dinosaur lovers, especially those who also love alligators or crocodiles, super croc is well worth the purchase!"
1,Don't Listen to the 11 year old gamer below,"Don't listen to the 11 year old game down below. I don't know who he or she is but he appears to have the same comment every game. Every game to him is five stars so don't listen to him. If you want to know if the game is good or not, you should read other comments by other reviewers."
3,really pointless,"You do nothing. You are just a prisoner. the germans have sniper rifles and other german guns. you have nothing. i am not saying you have to use knives, crowbars, hands, etc., etc. You can not fight. All you do is take some plans, avoid the big guys with the guns, and talk to some guys in a REALLY bad camera angle. So it is pointless. I am giving it back after one damn day.i was so excited when i saw this game. I was thinking, ""Hey maybe i can sneak into a German stronghold, steal a Lt.'s clothes, strangle him (or something to kill) and start shooting. But no, all you do is walk and get shot. Do you die? No, you go in the nurse's office. This game sux."
1,"Awful, awful game","Anyone who could give this game more than 3 stars must have worked on creating it. I have no problem with strategy games. The problem with this isn't that it's a strategy game, it's the fact that the game is just plain awful. Everything that has already been said is right; Controls = awful, graphics = awful, story = awful...it goes on and on. I think I do have to say this is the worst game I've ever played. I was hoping to be executed to put myself out of this gaming misery."
3,A Star is Born,"DeNiro. Duvall. Brando. Pacino. Depp. None of these great actors can hold a candle to Jason Stewart's performance as ""Sunset Photographer"" in Call Me. Stewart, the star of Murder at the Presidio and the best contestant Blind Date ever had, is mesmerizing as he delivers his trademark ""Ivan! Ivan! Just a couple -- please!"" off camera near the end of the flick. I know, I know, I always say that, and not to make a mountain out of a mole-grille, but J Stew just takes Call Me to another level."
3,This Book Is Average,I found that this book took a vary clinical look at what makes a good salesperson. It is someone interesting how they break down the attributes of a good salesperson. If someone was into the indiviudal physcology behind great sales people they would find this book more interesting.
4,practical and hopeful,"Marguerite Wright's book offers a hopeful perspective on rasing confident children within todays' society. While racism continues in subtle ways throughout America, this book offers parents and educators practical ideas for raising confident children. Her positive view helps the reader to see that it is possible to help a child (regardless of culture) to grow to their potential. Her practical guides are concrete and thought provoking. This book is a concise and excellent resource."
5,J.T.,A friend of mine gave me this CD even though I never heard of RS. Boy am I glad he did. A fantastic piece of writing with wonderful music. His songs describe vivid personal issues and are easy to relate to. I highly recommend this CD.
3,A Little Of This A Little of That,This is not my favorite Cleo album but The British Sessions highlight Cleo's career in the UK. This album features a little bit of Gershwin with FASCINATING RHYTHM and TEA FOR TWO as well as some Shakespeare Tunes. I love to hear Cleo sing anything but this album does not showcase her talents. You will want to add this to your collection if your a Cleo Fan because the tune I'M JUST WILD ABOUT HARRY is a real gem.
5,Fast and fun!,"I LOVE these balls! What a great, fun idea! I made Soccor Ball first--I finished it in a day and it turned out beautifully. My six-year-old son loves to play with it--and he even takes it to bed with him. Now I'm starting on one of the designs that uses border-print fabrics--this one is for me to keep. The balls come together really quickly and are a terrific way to use up some of your favorite scraps."
1,For the love of God don't buy this game!,"I've seen alot of crappy games come out for game boy, but this is positively the worst yet! I have never played the PC version of this game and I bet it is good in its own right, but unless you plan on burning money for the hell of it don't buy this game. The graphics suck bigtime and the levels are too easy!Heres some advice for you people who plan on re-making old games: Give the game better graphics, different levels than the original, hidden levels and a player friendly interface.This game does not include any of these things!P.S. I only gave this game one star because Amazon wouldn't let me put zero stars!"
1,wow...,"i honestly only bought this for comedy purposes, but i had no idea what i was in for!this is possibly one of the worst CDs ever produced, tribute or otherwise. the orchestration is incredibly sub par, and hugely aggravating.i was also largely disappointed to discover that it was put out in 2005. i was REALLY hoping for some late 70's/early 80's action. i should have paid more attention, i guess.also, from the sound of things, the only song with actual violin instrumentation (beyond the first violin) is passage to bankok (which is one of the dumbest songs ever written anyway). the rest of them reek of synthesizer (i think i actually have some of the same string samples!).and lastly, at virtually no point is the instrumentation actually a string quartet.i would really like to hang out with the two dudes who made this. i am betting that they are supremely insane. this one is definitely getting played at parties when i want people to leave."
5,Fabulous watch,This is the perfect watch. Extremely accurate. All the features you need. Incredibly low price.
5,Don't take it too seriously,"Some of the best humor is based on exaggeration and this book is an example. It is a collection of cartoons from the Baby Blues syndicated column and they are funny, although you have to approach them with a lack of literalness. All parents will recognize the circumstances depicted in the cartoons, although for their sake, I hope their experiences are not so extreme. My favorite is one where dad is coaching a soccer team and at the end, he falls down exhausted and says, ""Coaching is just parenting with a whistle."" As a former soccer coach, I could relate to that one.Read it for fun and don't take it too seriously."
3,too difficult....,"The graphics and franchise depth are incredible, but the pitching is nearly impossible. Randy Johnson cannot go 2 innings in a game without giving up at least 3 runs on ROOKIE mode. Games can be high scoring affairs when the computer hits anything you throw to the plate even in a perfect spot. They hit pitcher's pitches far more often than they would otherwise. Playability-wise, this game is much more difficult to master in the pitching realm than all-star baseball 2003."
5,What is Hector talking about????,"If Hector from the Bronx has already ""preordered"" that would seem to indicate he doesn't have one yet. Than how could he make comments about the graphics being great?????"
1,Extreme Garbage,"this gets one star because Amazon won't let you rate it any lower. films that promote the torture of animals are disgusting. people who torture animals deserve to get gored by them, to get stomped by them, and to get killed by them. this garbage make pornography looks wholesome. the film itself appears to have been made by someone kicked in the head one too many times. random scenes spliced together with no rhyme or reason. the cinematography looks like it came from a disposable cell phone. the subjects interviewed ramble on about nothing in particular. Amazon should be ashamed to sell something of this remarkably poor quality."
2,Try Powerpoint,"The limited clone of Powerpoint in Star Office is a joke. The animations do not work well at all, etc. The program is buggy and crashes constantly."
1,Cheap Trash!,"If I could give this piece of junk NO stars, I would.Coby has never been a favorite of ours [all of their products seem to be ""disposable""], but the price enticed us to buy two of their 5"" TV's to take along camping. I should have known. After an hour, the first TV [along with the radio] died. We switched over to the second one, and got a whole TWO hours before rigor mortis set in. Yes, we checked to see if it was the batteries, but it wasn't. Neither one worked on AC or DC.As Johnny Cochran might have said, ""save a buck and you're out of luck"".Do yourself a favor, and pay a few $ more for a better brand."
1,not working,i recommend not getting this item. they are being helpful getting this refunded to me though....
2,less then i expected,"i needed a replacement tv for my kitchen table and thought getting it with a radio would be great.however, the reception is horrible. I'm only getting three stations on the tv and none on the radio.I got much better reception with my old 9""zenith. perhaps the coby either needs a stronger antenna or i need to use it someplace else."
2,Not this one,Sonny Landreth is wonderful. He's done some fine solo stuff and great work with John Hiatt. But this CD contains nferior cuts from earlier in his career. Buy it after you become a big fan of his and have everything else. But get his other stuff first.
2,still not this one,"Only a handful of people around could have done better at that age, and those people are all great, so I give Sonny a break and give him more credit. But this is still inferior to his later work."
4,Unique and Time-Tested Prevention Solutions,"Modern medicine tends to use blood tests only to confirm the presence of disease. ""Normal Blood Test Scores Aren't Good Enough!"" makes it crystal clear how valuable they can be when used preventively. Find out why you shouldn't (and often can't) have your MD do preventive blood tests. Health, happiness, the avoidance of serious or life-threatening disease, and peace of mind can be the result of a good preventive plan. Ellie Cullen (the author and a registered nurse) also talks about some vitamins, minerals, and diet changes (including the blood-type diet) that have achieved miracles. The only imperfection is that the book has been more or less self-published, so the layout, photos, and editing are not the best. But, in a way, this just adds to the genuineness and personality of the message."
4,"Not great, but really good","Buy it. This is a good cd to get you started into the 80's rock scene. Some songs should have been included while others rejected but a solid collection. Should have included Moley Crue's Girls Girls Girls or Dr. Feelgood. Favorite Tracks: Round and Round, You got another think coming."
4,The Production saved this album...,Noreaga's debut album is a well produced one. The beats are slamming and he sticks to the formula that works. Noreaga isn't a lyrical MC but he does have charisma and energy. The guest appearances are hot and the flow of the album is consistent. Good effort from the N.O.R.E.
3,An interesting lady,"I have long been a fan of Josephine Baker, a remarkable lady who, as did other African-American entertainers, went to France to become a star. This film does a decent job telling her life's tale but fails somewhat for lack of a proper budget. In the 1920s, going from America, where she appeared in rather degrading roles on stage, to France, where she pushed her talents to the limit to become a major star. Her story would have been better told as a mini-series with a decent budget. Still, if this film is what we have it is better than no film at all. You might seek out the few films with her that are available, and pick up some of her recordings to see and hear the real Josephine Baker."
2,"looks fine, sounds okay",I got this as a gift. I not real hot on coca-cola products but I think its nice especially when its lit up. The problem I have with it is that it's very difficult to tune into a station and to even figure out where the station is. The dails on this radio are so small that you can't figure out what station your on. The static is bad and you have to have the radio in a certaion postition to get the best percipition. Once when you have that it does sound as good as any other radio.
3,Ok...,"This is an OK module, while it has many interesting things in it. The motivation for the PCs investigating it is not there. Why would most PCs even care what was going on in this place is beyond me. I bought it then decided not to use it in my campaigne. At best it is a filler for your world."
4,Great product!,The shipping was reasonable and the hood lights are great! I love the natural lighting that the bulbs give off! It is a great addition to our freshwater tank!
5,Excellent book,"Good book I had to read it for literature and I loved it, it's also a easy story to follow."
5,I love it,"I really like it, all my friends like it. One of best fragances I ever used. Even once a unknown girl asked to me what is the name of the fragance because she love it!."
4,Super Sequel,"It's like if you mix the soundtrack to Clockwork Orange with Royksopp's Melody AM and add a dash of Big Beat ala Fatboy Slim with some Mobyish vocals. There's a huge variety of music on this album, I must admit. One song sounds like a church rave. Another song sounds like it belongs on a Tom Jones tribute album. There's a ton of variety, which can be a bad thing. But in this case, I'd say it's good.-TarTar"
4,Pepe Deluxé - Beatitude,"While the pure fun factor isn't as high here as in their debut, Pepe Deluxe's second album, BEATITUDE, still has some partying to do before it ends. ""Salami Fever"" merges a rock aesthetic with the beat aesthetic wonderfully -- with some excellently cheesy classic vocodered lyrics, too. ""Ask for a Kiss"" is as blissful as anything Bent has done, while ""Daddys' Blazin' BBQ"" and ""Black Cadillac"" takes blues roots rock to the beat. ""Lying Peacefully"" is pure R&B, with an emphasis on the B part of it. But even though ""A Moment in Black and White"" is minimal and haunting, many of the songs here, however, are a bit more simplistic than those on SUPER SOUND. But thrumming drive of ""Cruel Youth"" deftly avoids this trap, as does the Burt Bacharach sweetness of ""First Goodbye."" The extra tracks skew more ethnic, with ""Numa"" heading towards the Middle East and ""Vamos Muchachos"" goes to Latin America. Not as energetic as their debut, but with its own high points."
2,Lots of potential,"Quietus is full of potential: potential story lines, potential characters, potential writing. But I could not help but be distracted by the lack of editing and proofreading. I felt like I was reading an early draft: it was full of poor grammar, outright mistakes (like 'alright' and 'illusive') and just plain bad writing. With help, Schilling could be a terrific author. I'm amazed that the book made it to press in this condition."
5,A Stunning and Insightful Novel!,"Considering my co-worker usually reads non-fiction or historical fiction, I was surprised when she recommended this suspense novel. I wasn't far into the story when I realized why she had chosen it and why she had been so enthralled. In this novel, which deals with death, the author gives insight to the darkest of emotions and fears. Using symbolism and allegory, she explores issues that would otherwise be unbearable to face. On the surface this is a thriller, but underneath, a deeply disturbing tale, with an understanding that earns it the title of ""Fine Literature."" To put it simply, the depth of this author's insight is simply astounding. My husband passed some years back. As I went through Kylie's journey, I found some of my own fear of death and grief lifting. Don't simply read it for the thrills, read it for this author's understanding of a very difficult subject. Very intelligent, very moving. And yes, very frightening!"
2,"Funny samples, sure ...","This book is made out of snippets and appears rather cool on the first look. Compared to authors like Dave Barry, however, Bryant's observations are not as much a belly laugh after all, but leave a weird after taste. A book to read and then give away."
2,Way over priced,This product is way over priced prior to this purchase I have paid $22.00 for the same item
4,a breathless ride,"Some of my previous reviews have been so negative that I'm delighted to find something that gives me a chortle. The language is intense, many of the sentences run on and on and on, often losing the way through a forest of thoughts. But oh, the laughs! And great clarity of the weaknesses of mankind. I was always impressed by the breadth of Duncan's literary foundation, which he shows off with glee and without apology. Impressed, too, by his knowledge and ironic interpretation of human psychology. Four stars because, although the book delighted me, there were too many moments of confusion among too many thoughts linked but left unfinished. The literary shrug might have been a bit overdone. And sometimes the unremitting density of language became wearisome.Definitely recommended."
1,A poor attempt,"In a novel that starts with a brilliant idea, this story falls drastically short of its potential. The storytelling is incoherent and impossible to follow at places, it goes off on utterly disconnected tangents, and seemingly ignores all basic conventions of good story telling. While certain leeway has to be given due to the story's premise, this story takes that leeway, rips it open, rapes it, and skips rope with it.Some enjoyable parts, such as Lucifer's recollections on Heaven and Eden, made me keep reading, but only to be terribly disappointed with the story as a whole. IF you're looking for a good read, or even a read that makes sense, do not turn to read this book."
3,I Lucifer,"Lucifer gets the message that God has forgiven him, but before he can be reinstated in heaven, he must spend a month in the body of a human being on earth. The writing is magnificently repulsive - very filthy and blasphemous and at the same time sparkling with wit and wonderful descriptions, metaphors, etc. The ending might be difficult to understand and is certainly not warm or fluffy."
4,WWF The Music Volume 2,The CD is great for the hard hitting WWF Fans who know who the wrestlers are. Because the majority of music on this CD are no longer in the World Wrestling Federation. Such as Sunny in ECW Vader in AJPW Flash Funk now known as Scorpio its all good but only for the REAL fan.
2,WWF Volume 2 is the least best CD that was ever made,"heres a rating on each track on WWF The Music Volume 21. Undertaker - Cool theme2. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Good3. Ahmed Johnson - The best theme on the track!!4. Wildman Marc Mero & Sable - Same as the track on Vol 35. Bret ""Hit Man"" Hart - Not the best singing, but good beat6. Vader - Good theme7. Mankind - OK8. Dude Love - Same as song on Vol 39. Faarooq - Repeats same lyrics over and over but overall not a bad song10. Rocky Maivia - Probably the 2nd best theme on the CD11. Sycho Sid - Same as song on Full Metal except over an extra minute12. Ken Shamrock - Not much of a difference as the song on Vol 313. Flask Funk - Horrible. [bad] lyrics and beat14. Sunny - Good theme for any Sunny fan15. Shawn Michaels - Bad theme. The one on Full Metal was much much better than this"
3,Good album.,"Jim Johnston did some good opening theme music for this album. I still like the Nation of Domination theme song, with its simmering groove and the gang of guys screaming the chorus. It's very funky with its rumbling keyboards. Also, the Shawn Michaels theme music is among the best here as well as You Start The Fire. I didn't like the Dude Love song very much. There are some songs that haven't really held up strongly after 8 years. But the music does advertise and promote the wrestlers strongly."
3,WWF: THE MUSIC VOLUME 2-NOT WHAT WAS EXPECTED,"This album is ot worth the money. Some good songs are on here, but the Shawn Michaels theme song is pathetic. Also, this album includes songs that were never heard of before. Save your money."
3,You are pathetic!,"This was the second volume of WWF Wrestlers' ""theme songs"". That is to say, the music that plays when they are walking to the ring and after they win a match. This is the entrance music circa 1997. If you were a wrestling fan ten years ago, you'll probably enjoy this CD. If you weren't, you probably won't."
3,Informative Resource,"I was just diagnosed with Hypothyroidism so I thought this book looked informative. It is a good resource about this condition, because it reports information that lay people can understand. I have not read it in it through completely, but refer to it now and then."
1,BOOORING!!!!!,I have read quite a few books on hypothyroidism but this one puts me to sleep every time I open it. She gives no specifics on how to treat your thyroid problem. She has other books that just say the same thing. The one on hair loss was ridiculous. Save your money folks.
5,The best thyroid book ever!,"This book was an enormous help to me. I learned all about hypothyroidism and how to deal with it. I also learned all the medications and alternative treatments available. AND most important of all, I found the section on how to deal with doctors very empowering. Remember, the doctors we choose are working FOR US and if they can't treat us like human beings...FIRE THEM! Also the pharmacutical companies should consider Mary's ideas about making more effective thyroid medications like a patch."
2,aquarium hood,"Please put name as Perfecto Recessed Aquarium Hood 23 *11 in oak , Now i am back to square one, no hood for my 24 aquarium"
1,Don't waste your money!,"What a disappointment! This book contains a few basic recipes, which are padded with recipes for everything from yeast bread to quick bread (with no explanation of what they're doing in a cookie book) and cookie recipes from various marketing boards. There are awesome cookie books on the market (and available from Amazon); even Betty Crocker's would be better than this -- and, for about the same price, you can get Judy Rosenberg's wonderful, detailed, book of awesome TNT cookies. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Not the real deal!,"The description for this album is misleading. It indicates that the listed artists are the ones singing vocals on the songs. They are not! They are sound-a-likes! The no-vocal karaoke songs are good, however, don't be fooled thinking you're getting original artists as the ad says."
2,Made me sick,I don't know if these things actually work. I tried using them a few times now and the only result I get is extremely sick. Whenever I take these I feel like I'm going to die. My body aches and I can hardly move. I also get super bloated and constipated. As far as I'm concerned they are a waste of money cause I can't even use them :(
2,A letdown after watching Pineapple Express,"This guy was the funniest character in Pineapple Express, but this movie wasn't nearly as funny. His character was a little creepy and not as likeable as he was in Pineapple Express."
5,Thank God!,"In a time when the radio is saturated with contrived lyrics and canned music there is hope and it is The Justin Tranter Band. With a sound that is unique, eclectic and yet still accessible Tranter's composistion comes from a place of honesty that cannot be faked. You cannot listen to this album without being moved....emotionally, by the lyrics that will hit home for people of all types. And physically, because you CANNOT sit still while Mike Herklots on drums, Brian Nash on keys and Neal Persiani on bass back up the ever astonishing vocals of Justin Tranter. With The Justin Tranter Bands debut CD ""Scratched"" this edgy foursome will hold you captive from beginning to end. BUY IT......NOW."
5,There should be more than 5 stars!,"There are no words to describe what a phenomenon Justin Tranter and his band are to the music world. There is no occasion this c.d. is not perfect for. I treat my c.d. like it was my baby, I am always afraid of it being too hot or too cold, if it is not in my stereo (which is a rare occasion, indeed) I keep it away from all other c.d.s on it's very own shelf... because it is unlike anything else: it is heartbreaking, joyous, and sexy all in one little metallic disc. Please, do yourselves a favor and buy this and tell everyone about this exquisite band. Please... pretty please..."
4,Brilliant in places,"Eagleton's lengthy chapter on the Labour movement in Britain, although it does have touches of brilliant satire, is unlikely to be of as much interest to American readers as some of his other chapters in which he discusses Catholics in England or the anthropology of Oxbridge, for example. At his best, Eagleton is both funny and sharply insightful. And it is worth wading through the longueurs to find these places."
2,Great for a little baby but not for a bigger one,"I didn't care for this bag too much. The spaces inside the flap for diaper and acessory storage were too small and if filled, the flap stuck out. No outer pocket was also a drag, you would be surprised at how much you miss that outer poket to drop things into. It was difficult to handle as well. I will definately go for a different style. One idea though... We had our daughter's name embroidered on the flap. It was so cute!!!"
3,Roomy but annoying,"I agree about the space this bag provides - I can easily fit a couple diapers, small wipes case, a small toy or two and my wallet without a problem. Inside pockets are nice for cell phone, etc. and other essentials. But the flap is big and gets in the way, not to mention the velcro can be annoying to pry open when you're in a hurry (or in church, trying not to be TOO conspicuous or anything, LOL). I don't use it as a messenger bag because slung across my front it gets in the way and I feel pregnant again already. I find that it falls off my shoulder alot and I think two smaller straps would work better instead of one thicker one."
3,They're okay,"I was disappointed when I got them because I wanted serrated knifes and didn't look close enough before I bought them. To me, a ""steak knife"" needs to tear through steak. I guess if I take the time to sharpen them often, they'll last me until I decide to buy a different set."
3,Fair,Steak knives are not as expected. Knives are too light for steak knivesChicago Cutlery 9-pc. Steak Knife Set - Onyx (Includes 8 Knives Plus Case)
3,Not Cagnina's Best Work....,"Having read much of Cagnina's other efforts, it seems that LT is a compliation of familiar settings and themes, and characters, but lacks some of the purity of other characters. LT sets itself in an area that Cagnina frequents, but offers something of a Cliff's Notes version of his othr works.I recommend contacting the publisher and pushing for new releases of Cagnina's better efforts. You will be rewarded with more complex situations and characters, and material that seems to be more from the heart."
1,decieving,This product was not AT ALL what I expected. It is nothing more than old cheap technology in a new technology wrapper. I have a shower radio that sounds better. It has NO notable powered sub function. It's sonic qualities don't exist. I would like to return it. It's crap.
1,Product only worked for a day,"This product worked the first day I turned it on for my aunt. Since this was a Christmas present, it was not turned on until 01/01/07 and did not work the day after or since. Can this defective product be replaced?"
3,good enough for the purpose . . .,"I bought this TV because I needed a cheap monitor for recording videotape to CD, and it has RCA inputs (unlike the Coby that costs a buck or two less, if the product descriptions are to be believed). The picture quality is primitive, and the reception, from what little experimentation that I've done, appears to be miserable--but the unit does what I want it to do. I haven't used it much, though, so it remains to be seen whether the TV's reliability is as bad as many other users seem to have found. For $16, I don't expect much!"
2,Overproduced by WAY too many not so special guests...,"The Blind Boys of Alabama sound spectacular on this cd, and the gospel combo backing them up is exellent, the songs are also great, and the Boys' harmonies are swinging, however the special guests(who are mostly not so special) wiegh this projest down. There is a great version of 12th Month of The Year, Go Tell it on the Mountian and The Christmas Song with jazz piano great Les McCann. Otherwise there are too many soul r&b type artists who don'tconform well to the Boys' ad thier gospel, blues jazz style. Aaron Nevelle completely ruins several songs, with his feminine wimpy whining, and many singers rap thier way thru songs. Too many doo wop-ish guest stars water this down. Too bad the producers here went so commercial."
1,What a disappointment,There's only one good track on this CD with Mavis Staples. Buy it for that. The rest sucks
1,This was a true waste of my money,"I purchased this trim kit to replace an original Gerber kit because that is what the kit was supposed to do. As it turns out, after paying a plumber to replace it, one of the stem valves was defective, and further, one of the seats was already cracked upon opening the package. There were also brass metal shavings in the package and on the parts enforcing the poor quality craftsmanship that apparently when into the production of these parts. Also, because the package came in sealed plastic, once I opened it, the packaging was destroyed and wasn't in any condition to return it in. So as a result, I had to purchase a new kit (from another manufacturer) to complete the job! So between the cost of the kit and shipping, $50 went down the drain (no pun intended), not to mention the labor cost for my plumber. Never again. Do not buy this product!"
3,A Decent Supplement,"Gene Vincent recorded briefly for the Challenge label (co-founded and co-owned by Gene Autry) circa 1966. The sides he produced are rock 'n' roll with a bit of country and 60s pop influence. This is a good collection, though not the best place to start. That honor obviously goes to the classic 50s rockabilly he did with the Blue Caps. There are some fine songs here, including ""Born to be a Rollin' Stone,"" ""Lonely Street,"" ""Love is a Bird,"" and a fine cover of Merle Haggard's ""I'm a Lonesome Fugitive."" I could have done without the studio chatter and false starts, and the alternate takes are slightly unnecessary. But, hey, complete is complete.One last thing: the final song is listed as an alternate take of ""Fugitive;"" it is actually another alternate of ""Rollin' Stone."""
3,Better than what is currently on TV,I remember seeing the original St Trinian's movie eons ago. This is amucing and I will be getting the other that is available
2,Not so much,"Bought this as a Christmas present, was completely disappointed.This is a cheap product. There were screws falling out of it when it was being taken out of the package. Would probably serve it's purpose as a radio but not as cassette player. Going to see about returning it."
1,Waste of money,"If all you want is a radio/tape player this might suffice, as long as you don't want very precise volume control. If you want to record from an outside source, buy something else. The slide controls for volume, function and band selection ate sloppy and the tape recorder buttons fell out the first time I tried to use the recorder. This product is a total waste of money!"
3,I Wish I'd Known It Didn't Support Mac.,"As a Mac user, the programs included on the CD and about half the book proved useless. You can download the graphic and template files from their webpage. Otherwise, the book proved very useful and did indeed teach me, a complete novice, the basics of html in a weekend. I found some parts of the book to be difficult to follow."
3,Disappointed,Its Ok.. I hoped for it to be a little more like What to expect when expecting.. I was disappointed
2,this book really turned me off,"when i found out i was having twins (surprise) i ran to find anything i could read on the subject. i was very offended by the author's suggestion that most twin pregnancies are so precious... suggesting you should gain large amounts of weight (to support the babies), which my doctor advised against, and that you should not exercise. both of these things are myths that should not be continued in print!"
3,This book scared me to death!!,"I read other books about being pregnant with multiples prior to this book. I was fairly confident in everything I was doing until I read this book. It really disturbed me! I felt like I wasn't eating enough and my babies would be sickly, emaciated little things. How far from the truth! In every ultrasound they have measured bigger than their actual age and all body parts and organs are healthy.The book does have a lot of good information in chapters 7 - 10. I would not put all of your eggs in one basket with this book. Buy another for some variety and your own sanity."
5,Triplet Mom puts this book to the test....,"I found this book when I was 6 weeks into my pregnancy, but the time I gave birth to my ggb Triplets, the books was worn and dog-earred - I had read and re-read this book many times during my difficult pregnancy.It was not only informative but motivational, I gained inspiration and was encouraged by the success stories and felt less out of control, because all of the tests and procedures were explained in the book, so being informed helped me settle down. I also knew when I was in trouble and took the advice from the book and got myself to the hospital when I went into pre-term labor. Being informed helped me save my babies.I am a very proud mother of triplets and I want to thank Dr. Luke for putting together this awesome resource!!"
2,I had to stop reading this book it upset me so much,"I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds. I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet. It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be. Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight. The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy! I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds. My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy.This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you."
4,first time mom of twins,"When I found out I was having twins, I knew I needed a special book just for a multiples pregnancy. I am short and slender, so I was worried about carrying healthy, full term twins. I followed the nutrition advice from this book, which was to pretty much eat twice as much as a normal pregnant person. I was concerned about gaining weight but my babies came first and though I was nauseous, I tried to stick to their recommended diet. I only gained about 45 pounds, and went up to 38 weeks. I had two big, healthy twin boys (7lbs 11, and 6 lbs). I lost all my weight 5 months post partum, and my boys are always at least in the 90th percentile or even off the charts in size and weight. I'm giving four stars because I wasn't so impressed with their advice on twin breastfeeding."
5,Healthy Full-Term Twins- Need I say More?,Highly recommended for anyone pregnant with twins or super twins. It's true everything is different with twins-beginning with pregnancy. So why not get a book that treats it differently? I got this book during the 2nd trimester after reading good reviews on amazon. I thought about not doing buying it- but am so glad I did. It includes detailed information on the signs of pre-term labor which is key to getting to term when you are pregnant with more than one. I delivered healthy big (over 7 pounds each) full term babies with the help of this book!
4,Great resource about pregnancy- not so much about birthing them!,"This book was a great resource to providing information on how to have a healthy pregnancy with twins. I just wish my Doctor could have read it too!One thing it didn't help with so much was the means by which to get the babies out in the safest way. I ended up with a c-section and after lots and lots of research have come to the conclusion that it was unnecessary, especially after having my first singleton all naturally."
5,Must have book if you are prego with multiples,"I purchased this book when I first found out I was prego with triplets. I was quite distressed because my regular OB wanted me to reduce down to twins as he was sure I wouldn't be able to carry triplets to term (for trips)and healthy. I am also a petite woman (5ft)and he said ""there isn't enough room in your uterus"". I read this book in two days and was so encouraged by all the things expectant moms can do to increase their chances. So far, so good. This is the Bible for HOM moms. I have since spoken to other triplet moms and they too LOVE this book. I have referred to this book several times during the course of my pregancy and keep it by my bedside. This is a must have!!!"
1,Who switched the CD?,Was looking forward to hearing some good music but somebody switched the CD. Got the right cover but the CD inside looks like its been through a hurricane and the music is lousy! Am sending back immediately. How can this happen Amazon!!?? Very unhappy with this purchase.
4,Rich and the boys are back!,"I'm going to make this short. Go buy the cd, because in my opinonthis is superior to their first two albums. Rich sounds F*%kingangry, and his vokils are so sick and Derek Hoffman is one of themost talented drummers today. As far as the musick goesits' more brutal and staight forward death, but interestingriff work. Just pick it up you won't be dissapointed."
2,PRINT TOO SMALL,"I had purchased several of the bibles previously and was very pleased, but when I received this bible, I was very disappointed. The print is too small to read on a daily basis. I kept this bible and gave my friend the larger copy I had at work. I guess I should have read more on the description."
5,contemporary bible,"great translation of the King James version. I ordered the red cover for my husband because I had the blue one myself. I was sent another blue cover, but my husband likes this version so much he said to just keep it. Makes understanding God's word much easier."
4,PLease consider this...,"I really must write a bit regarding a previous reviewer whose understanding of language, translation, and how God MUST act in the preservation and transmission of the Bible is dubious and therefore potentialy misleading. The so-called ""Majority Text"" upon which the KJV is based was at the time of its' translation a collection of ancient texts, the best available at that time. But it was not one manuscript. Since then, older and more accurate writings were found. Some people would have us believe that unless a manuscript was preserved to the knowledge of Western (English?) believers somehow God's Word was lost. This is nonsense at best, arrogance at worst. The KJV is a very good translation. Regarding the CEV, it too is an admirable effort by people commited to the transmission of God's Word into English as used today from the best mansucripts available."
5,Contemporary English Bible: low cost edition,"My comments are not on the CEV translation, but rather on this particular edition. Among all low cost editions of the whole Bible (Protestant canon), this one is outstanding in three respects:1) it has the most extensive annotations (footnotes, introductions and outlines for each book of the Bible, and study helps) of any. They are not as extensive as many full-fledged study Bibles, of course, but it is a fraction of the price.2) these annotations appear to have been designed to be solely descriptive, not reflecting any particular theological or scholarly bias. Thus, this edition can be used by persons with quite a wide range of theological orientations.3) it has the largest print size. (Many low cost editions have rather small print.)"
3,"Great translation, small font","I love this version of the Bible, as it's written to allow you to focus on the actual message rather than the wording. Unfortunately, the font was a bit small to make it a comfortable read for a study Bible."
3,Holy Bible in Easy to read format,"I really like the Contemporary English Version. However, the Bibles were quite small. Much smaller than I had hoped for. I feel like they were a good buy."
5,Great for teen Bible study,"I bought 10 copies of this Bible for a teen Bible study I'm doing with 7th-12th graders, most of whom have no knowledge of the Bible at all, other than what they learned from Veggie Tales! The translation is easy to understand and non-intimidating. We always stop at an exciting point in a story, and some of them are starting to read alone at home to see how the story ends. The extremely reasonable price made it easy for me to buy several of them, and because we all have the exact same Bible (not just the same translation), we can all turn to the same page until they become more familiar with the layout of the Bible. I'm ordering 5 more!"
4,Holy Bible: CEV a good translation,"This is an inexpensive, good Holy Bible. It is a translation (as opposed to a paraphrase), and it is very readable. This paperback or a hardback version is a must in every library. Just keep the dust off of it, the preacher might drop by."
5,A must read...,"Hugh Leonard writing heals the soul the way a crackling fire warms a body on a winters night. His skill at capturing a life in Dalkey, a place I am so familiar with albeit a more modern one, is unique, setting in place a slice of historical life for generations to come. His settings and story capture a more simple Dublin yet one that we are all familiar with. It breathes life into a lovely town set in a beautiful part of Ireland. This book is my favourite...ever."
3,Points deducted for lucidity,"This album is a good effort, with some nice spacey beats and interesting samples. I especially like the song ""Parachute"". There is definitely some good stuff here. But the problem is, the album doesn't have that DREAMY feel that seems to make the best IDM what it is. It's a little restless in general, a little anxious. If you prefer a more lucid style though, by all means pick this up. But if you enjoy the dreaminess of omnimotion, sounds from the ground, etc., you could do fine to pass this up."
5,When Andy met Todd,"Someone had a brilliant idea, getting these two together, chancing that their individual tendencies towards self-indulgence wouldn't implode the project altogether. What it amounts to, in the end, is that Rundgren puts some flesh onto Partridge's cheese-and-pickle navel gazing. If you close your eyes, you're a schoolboy in a field of bluebells, watching the ants eat your Flake bar. And some days, that's just what you need."
1,Not about Forecasting,"This book should be called Fashion Theory or Introduction to Fashion Cycles and Theory and NOT Fashion Forecasting. Forecasting was lost in translation throughout the book, and lacked focus. This book does not do justice to the scientific aspect of forecasting and is not well organized. There is almost no information on methods used by market researchers today. Author seems well versed in fashion theories, which students do not relate to in this class or day and age. Simmel (1904)is great, but maybe not for these kids in this class! Students found the book difficult to follow and did not find the book teaching them any new knowledge from what they had already learned in fashion history or fashion theory. I was caught by surprise too late and had to put together lecture and resources from scratch. I now use a business book and use fashion as one application."
3,May take time...,On my third box...haven't noticed any great change...but some improvement. We'll see as time goes by.
2,Harlan has never won me over,"My primary complaint about this book, as with the other books of this alternate history series by Mr. Thomas Harlan, lies in the poor writing and the unbelievability of the historical story line.The military scenes were good. Perhaps this is due to Mr. Harlan's time spent as a PBM game monitor. In any case, this was the best part of the novel.I never felt attached to any of the characters in this tale, they were shallow and one dimensional. I never felt an attraction to a hero, or revulsion toward a villian. Most damning, I never believed the relationships between characters reflected any real grasp of the historical period used as a backdrop for this alternate setting.I cannot recommend this book. I will repeat, however, that the scenes depicting battle and all things military have some appeal, and that is why I gave the book two stars."
4,Flatten your Abs Forever,"This video was very interesting and entertaining. Paul Chek has a strange and dry sense of humor in this video. The overall content of the video reveals the problems that can arise from poor diet. He explains digestive problems from a scientific and biological perspective. He recommends a book called Metabolic Typing Diet by William Wolcott, which seems to be the basis behind his theoris on diet and exercise. The main focus of the video centers around diet, digestion, food allergies and organic foods. His final analysis is ""you are when you eat, as well as, what you eat"", and that having a trim, healthy body is the byproduct of a healthy, wholesome diet. In my opinion, his theories make a lot of sense, but he does get a little extreme in his opinions on eating nothing but organic food, which might be difficult for most people to do."
3,A waste of a good idea,"It is not what I espected to be, altough it perform its funtion as it says in the box, it could have been better if worked as a real interface tv/pc, also, I needed to buy a controler to see movies in the pc, someting like this should be included whit the intalation software"
4,"a little cheap, but serves its purpose!","i bought this as a gift for my husband because he doesn't seem to take care of his games, the case is a little cheap feeling but it does what it's supposed to, it also has a place for the memory card, which helps keep everything together."
2,No Good,"Seriously, if you want to understand EE, get Agarwal's text...this thing is for students who are a little , not so good!"
1,Archaic Thinking,"Just reading the title ""Our Chosen Child"" shows this book was made for the olden days of adoption. Who chooses a child now? Long gone are the days of selecting a child from an orphanage, at least domestically. Then, the first fill in page is a family tree! Don't most people know that family tree projects are THE WORST, anxiety provoking things for adopted children? Whose tree is it? Bio or Adopted family? I just don't like this at all. Create your own lifebook or scrap albumI received this as a gift, I would never use it. We would never want our daughter to feel like we chose her like a doll or a puppy. We are the luckiest parents in the world to have been chosen to be her parents."
2,Not what I'd hoped for...,"This book, while obviously well-intentioned, leaves too much unsaid in the life of a child who joins a family through adoption, in my opinion. There's no space for including the child's biological roots or specifics about their birth family, but only a vague ""other people who love you"" page, for example.I didn't feel comfortable using it OR giving it as a gift, so it sits in a box. I'll create my own lifebooks."
3,is this book for real????,"Wow - after reading the 1st review i had to personally checkout the book and make sure it was a really effort by the Author -Shiv Khera. And boy was a surprised. the book is full of little stories and fables mostly it would appear to be attributed to Zig Ziglar; Jim Rohn; Brain Tracy and may be even Tony Robbins. I found this book a easy read may because i had already read the stories in other books many many years ago. To me Shiv's work appears to be something borrowed, something old and formed into something new. I was how ever dissapoointed that for a indian man he had no indian fables in this book. The american model and style proves that this book is after all full of recycled ideas of other great thinkers. If this is the case i suggest they be acknowledged or at least make them aware of this book. therefore I strongily reccommend to Shiv he follow this book ideas. And do the right thing. BE REAL DONT CLAIM OTHERS PHILOSPHY AS YOUR OWN - you will get caught out."
4,Rice Steamer,Great product. We eat a lot of rice and we are able to leave it in the steamer for several days without it drying out. It also makes rice perfectly and without the mess.
1,Inner pot break down after 1 year and no replacement,"I bought this rice cooker back in September 2009 (wish the other review come out earlier) and the rice cook worked greatly. However, about a few weeks back, I noticed some small silver spot on the inner pot (the coating is broken down) and I started search the internet for a replacement inner pot. After an extensive search, I could not find any and went to Sanyo's parts distributor and found out that the inner pot was discontinued. Now I will have to buy to new rice cooker to replace it. My advice is not buy any of the Sanyo rice cooker as they have discontinued all inner pots."
1,Rice turns bad the same day,"The sanyo rice cooker is aweful. I am asian, and i've cooked rice my whole life. I thought the product would be decent based upon the reviews. It cooks the rice decent, but you can not keep it warm for a day, the rice turns yellow."
3,Takes 40 minutes to cook rice,"This rice cooker takes 40 minutes to cook regular white rice, and this is in a ""quick"" mode. The ""standard"" rice cookers which cost half as much will take only around 20 minutes to cook rice, and the rice tastes just as good.The real value of this rice cooker is that this will cook rice porridge as well. It also appears to be a good steamer. But if you want a rice cooker which can cook rice in a very fast time, look somewhere else."
2,not for recording,"I bought this for recording my son playing violin for his review, but the play back sound was terrible.Not clear and not big enough.I was very disappointed with this one.I should have bought Sony one."
1,Poor product and poor seller response,The cassette tape player was inexpensive but I expected it to work - the tape player does not operate at a constant/correct speed and the slide tuner for the radio is loose so stations cannot be found. I emailed the seller customer service as directed and ask how to proceed but received no response.
3,okay but should have 2 speakers,This boom box is exeptable but it really should have two speakers. it sounds weird and it will eventually break on you after about a year. okay quality.
3,not very good,"I bought this to mainly play cassettes, the sound is not very good. The tape would get stuck on play, if you tried to stop it it wouldn't and it would eat the tapes. The company was very nice about it and i returned it and got a refund."
2,Coby CX144a Portable Am/FM Cassette Player/Recorder.,It recorded well. However during replay the tape would catch on something and couldn't be used. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Radio,"Non era quello che mi aspettavo, pensavo fosse piu' di marca, e di una qualita molto scadente. Va bene cosi la prossima volta prendero qualcosa piu' costoso."
2,Not spill or leak proof,"The car bounces and your coffee spills out of top; even if the drink opening is closed. It does keep your coffee hot. Over-all, disappointed."
1,cheap piece of Chinese junk!,"1st one came broken in the box,returned it and got a replacement.2nd one broke after opening and closing exactly 4 times!Broke the same as the first one.Four metal screws threading into four essentially plastic straws.Piss poor design and shoddy Asian manufacturing!Just junk,Coleman should be ashamed to put their name on it!"
2,Not a Bright Idea,"This little product is good for packing away and using when the lights go out or as a night light when camping. It is easy to push the top half into the bottom part thus making it half it's size for storage. My problem is with the brightness. I shelled out the bucks for the 4 ""D"" batteries and the light is dim at best. I can't even read by it. I bought it specifically to help me see while wiring up my stereo reciever but had to resort back to a flashlight in my mouth because I couldn't see well enough keep track of the wiring aspecially my speakers. I have 7.1 surround and that's a lot of wires. To sum up, lantern is small enough to store anywhere but the light is junk and only useful if the power goes out, if then. I don't like this lantern and would never buy it again."
1,do not buy for AT+T DSL. Seriously. Save yourself the hassle. It won't work.,"For use with AT+T DSL, I second everything written here. Troubleshooted this D-Link modem for over an hour before giving up.From my very limited knowledge, AT+T DSL needs a modem with a ""NAT"" function. This modem doesn't have a NAT function. Therefore, your modem won't work.Despite my dislike of the Motorola 2210, I bought another one and my DSL was running instantly."
1,An amazingly bad book,"This book is one of the worst written books I've ever seen. I bought it as an impulse buy when I saw ""InfoBus"" in the title - I'd really like to know more about this. And it may well be that there's a lot of information here, but wading through the rambling, disorganized text is frustrating beyond belief. I made it through 100 pages, but I doubt that there was a single page that wasn't painful to read. I'm going to see if I can get my money back."
1,English is the author's second (or third) language,"The technical information contained in this book could have been written in a pamphlet. The rest of the writing is garbage. The author's writing style is tuned for beginners of computers, not to advanced IT professionals. Wiley aims their publications for high-end developers, but has failed with this book."
4,This is. . .,"What we have here is a fine marriage of styles between Pink Floyd and Van Der Graaf Generator; another way to describe is that imperious sax rhythms hold hands with introspective guitar solos. The two opening tracks ""Ice Queen"" and ""Empty Houses"" illustrate this fushion nicely. The watermark of the album is ""Insolent Lady"" whose climax seems to almost out Floyd the Pink Floyd band. It's one of the great, albeit, unknown moments of progressive rock. The next two tracks, ""Miracle Worker"" and ""Religion"" are a decided comedown after the hazy brilliance of Lady. The former has a folkish bent, while the latter just seems to have been stuck on either to take up space or to prelude the final track. ""Sun God"" closes the album. It is about ascent from darkness into light, the light being a crescendo wail of keyboards and vocals. Fans of Van Der Graaf take note, Time Is was released the same year as Pawn Hearts, and the similarities are beguiling. This is a very worthy listen."
2,Uninformed,"I read this book believing could give some insight. But it was negtive, poorly researched, badly informed. There were about maybe about a quarter of the book. Might have some used. I believe he never talk to, reasearched there history for the cause of their problems. But knew of there present problems. And try to create the answers. Like try, try again. Buckle up, get out that depression. All and well, but without the reason of problem you cannot solve it. Without why, who, what. It's like read the last few pages of the book and you knew it."
1,Going back to basic rice cooker,"I've used this unit for several months, almost daily. It cooks decent rice, though not significantly better than does a $30 ordinary electric rice cooker. This cooker is difficult to keep clean. There is a removeable lower lid. The non-removeable upper lid is attached to the main unit and collects rice ""gunk"" during the cooking process. This has to be wiped away -- not easy to do when you can't use running water. The cooking bowl is touted as thick guage steel. Unforunately, I dropped mine. It became misshapen from the fall, and no longer fits in the cooking unit. I'm going back to a $30 regular electric unit -- the kind I had for ten years, that cooked rice fine, and was easily cleaned."
4,Satisfied:),More prettier than the picture on Amazon.Timer function is so convenient!Cooked rice tastes very good.I'm happy with that by now.
4,"Sleek, Stylish, Hard worker","Did a great job cooking ""Basmati rice"" effortlessly. No mess while cooking. Very easy to clean due to the non-stick coating.Nice big buttons to operate. Liked the elegant steel finish.Rice came out very fluffy and fragrant. One con is that the display does not have the number ""12"" and for 12.15pm, it displays 0:15pm. A little confusing if you want to setup the timer feature for rice to be ready during the noon hour.Overall its a good cooker."
4,The smell exists in mine too,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great rice cooker. However, the chemical smell that comes from the casing under the pot makes me nervous. It is like a strong syrofoam chemically smell that I sometimes taste in my rice. Not happy about it and might send it back."
5,sanyo rice cooker =A+,"This product lives up to my expectations in every way. Since I have had it less than a month I can't address it's durability. Everything I have cooked has turned out well. The timed finish is wonderful, the instructions clear and the inner pan easy to clean. Using the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook to choose this model was a big help and the recipes are great also. I recommend getting this cooker and the book."
4,The drawings of Harry Carmean,I bought a few sketches of this artist on line and thought it best to educate me further by purchasing this Master Draughtman series on Harry Carmean to further enhance my knowledge of the artist and this helped.
1,HIS KITS ARE TOTALLY OUTDATED,"In this book, you are asked to look into buying Mr. Hicks' ""Success Kits,"" because they supposedly get you ""on the right track.""Gimme a break! Click on Mr. Hicks' name under the title. This will give you a list of other books written by him. Scroll down to his ""Kits"" Most of them about mail-order, real estate, etc. were published in 1987! Wow. Talk about outdated!"
2,Stopped working after 3rd use.,"Worked well until the ON/OFF switch stopped functioning. It acted like it wasn't going to turn on after the 2nd use but eventually powered on. By the 3rd use, the switch ceased use. No remedy for the situation has been found yet. Considering I bought it as a lighting deal for under $20 I was at least expecting at least 6 months of reliable use."
3,Bon-Aire 12-16L inflates tires and burns the crap out of your fingers all at the same time.,"Used it a couple of times and it worked great. the last time the lighter connector got so hot that when I grabbed it to remove, it blistered my finger. BUT, i called the company and they sent me a replacement. Didn't know it but the model that I bougth on Amazon was discontinued a couple of years before I bought it so I got the current model. Tried it out and it worked great and no smell of burning flesh. I gave it 3 stars because manufacturer was nice on phone and sent replacement right away."
5,oh mr. nick cave you have done it again...,fantastic show! this is one of the few bands that bring an album to life when playing live. 5/5
5,Stop! Quit! I can't take it!,"Wow! What can I say? This is one of the most amazing DVDs I've ever had the pleasure of viewing! Whoa! What amazing music! What amazing showmanaship!! Please...let the words ""Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds"" ring thoughout the land."
5,Coleman 2-Burner Dual Fuel Powerhouse,"We really liked that it was as big as our old Model 413G, but could be used with either fuel. Can get two pots on at the same time with no problem. Same well-built frame as the older models too. This is great for camping or for emergencies when the power is out."
2,Less bang for your buck,"I am new to video editing. I am trying several different programs to find the best for my needs.The program Nero Ultra Edition 6.0 comes up on the bottom of list. I thought at first the user interface would be a great addition, but I could not get all the programs to run, especially Nero Vision. The program would not open because of the following error message: "" This program must have Directx 9.0 to run application."" I brought up the diagnostics tool ""Info tool"" and looking at software tab I discovered I had the DirectX 9.0 installed. I have wasted $79.00 and a weeks wroth of time time trying to get this to work, and tech support was a joke and cost $ 1.29 per minute. I will stick with Microsoft Movie maker, and ULead Video Studio 7.0 ""which I must say has not let me down once!"""
4,"Finally, software that works with XP","There have been some complaints of problems with this software but installation on my computer went smoothly.I am running Windows XP so I had some difficulty finding burning software that was truly compatible. I finally decided to try out Nero6 and am very glad that I did. I would take Nero over Easy CD Creator any day!I would give a higher star rating, but my production of ""coasters"", while minimal, has not been as low I would like."
3,MP4 encode,MP4 reencoded with Nero seem not playing on DVD w/ Mpeg4 decoding. I have Philips DP642 supposed to play MP4 I try reencode movie w/ Nero 6.3 it's faster than other softwares (AutoAGK)but not playing on my DVD. Everything working fine.
1,Hidden Limitation On Ripping from CD to MP3,Product box leads you to believe that you can rip CD to MP3 and then write a CD with tracks you like. As soon as you start out they inform you that in order to rip more than 30 tracks you will have to give them more money. I could find no mention of this annoying restriction until the software was installed.
5,no problems,"i downloaded this program and installed it without any problems on win xp.it probably is less user friendly than easy cd creator but their are myriad modules to utilize .if one does not need dvd application softwear a cheaper program would be advisable.personally,i very much like this softwear esp for the dvd applications"
4,"A few small problems, but still the best burning rom out.","I used nero ever since I got a free version with my old cd burner a couple years ago, I will keep using it as long as it gives me the best features for the price. I use it mostly for dvd burning and its great you can fit a full 2 hours of video on a standard disc unlike other software (roxio) witch takes up nearly 1 gig just for the menu. It burns fast also with quick encoding. The few negetives are:1. Menues for VCD will not work if there is more than 1 video file on them. (burn without a menu and you should have no problem)2. Inserting chapter breaks into video files for dvd will not work, it will only record the first chapter of each video and the rest will freeze.(use a video editing software like Honestech Video Editor 5 to split the video before bringing it into Nero or make the video one track)If the above 2 issues were fixed this would be flawless."
2,You're on your own,"No technical support (I had to wait 5 days for help with an installation problem - email is your only free support option), wizard-based interface looks nothing like any other Windows program you've used, confusing array of separate programs with no integration except for the wizard front-end, inadequate documentation, lack of flexibility in naming files and determining file locations, etc.I'm not impressed. At least Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator ships with a manual though it too suffers from a lack of integration of separate programs."
1,Crashed My Computer,"After installing this program I rebooted and got a blue screen, after working with their technical support on the phone for about an hour (paying by the minute) they said there was nothing further that could be done.My computer tech was able to get things up and running until I tried to install it again, and yet again, my system goes down.I decided no more Nero after my tech fixed again, I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 7, installed it, and WOW. the video editing which Nero doesn't do much of at all, was wicked.My advice is to stop paying attention to all this advice and make your own decision. If you want your system to boot, then get Roxio's Easy Media Creator 7."
1,Pathetic Support,"As mentioned in other reviews, the support from Ahead Software is sorely lacking. The website does not have a searchable knowledge base and the FAQs are poorly done and missing some known errors.When installing the program I kept getting the dreaded error 6 copy file error. I am trying to download the very latest version off the web and using my serial number to activate it. If this doesn't work I will be taking this product back."
5,Candy Corn,What can I say? It is great candy corn dressed in holiday colors. How can you go wrong? I was very pleased.
3,Hit or miss,"This book is hit or miss. When Crowther is trying to write like HP Lovecraft, his stories are fun reads. When he's trying to write like Stephen King, his stories are unneccessarily gorey and pretentious."
2,Hair Bag,"This heating cap is very large, in fact you either must have an enormous amount of hair or a very large head, of which I have neither. It doesn't get hot enough to feel. I am very disappointed with this product."
5,Great!,"This was Ken Burns first documentary. It set a standard of excellence that he has continued to meet in all of his subsequent documentaries, particularly CIVIL WAR, PROHIBITION, JAZZ, BASEBALL and NATIONAL PARKS."
5,A Favorite At My Fingertips,"I received, C.S. Forester and the Hornblower Saga for my kindle. Ordering kindle books is such an easy thing to do - you just click and as if by magic it appears on your kindle screen - it doesn't get easier than that. I think I'll go back and get the rest of the series :}"
4,Not his best,"This is a decent origami book overall. There are some very impressive models, such as the three headed dragon, but most of the book is pretty watered-down compared to some of Montroll's other books due to lack of detail."
2,Directions and layout unclear...,"I just found the directions in this book to be confusing, and some intermediate steps would probably have resolved this. There were several points that I found difficult to follow, a problem I have not had in any other origami books I have used.I gave this two stars because I think most of the models designs are nice. But considering the large majority of this book is supposed to be step-by-step to the final design, and those were not very clear to me, I have to give it the thumbs down"
2,Poorly Built,"I recently purchased this to actually learn the ukulele, however when I first received it did seem nicer than I thought, however im assuming because of the cheap strings it came out of tune shortly. So I bought new strings from the local music shop. But soon after while trying to tune it, the it broke, I believe its called the bridge (the piece that holds the strings) pulled it right up, I thought I could fix it as suggested on various sites to just use some wood glue, that didnt work. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because the overall quality was better than anticipated as long as you keep the same strings and dont mind tuning it frequently."
3,Good,This is really best for kids. If your serious about wanting to learn to play the ukulele you'll have to get new strings before you can even play. They're plastic. Good value for the money.
5,Laverne and Shirley thanks for the memories,"Laverne and Shirley thanks for the memoriesReviewer: Mary M McNulty from Canton, MA United StatesI watched Laverne and Shirley faithfully. They made me laugh so very hard. The fact that they brought enjoyment to millions of homes is all that needs to be said. Their side kicks Lenny and Squiggy were crazy funny, you had to love them.Thanks Amazon for having the CD, I had the original album. You smile the whole time you listen to their recordings because of them not their musical ability.Thanks again.."
3,Tricycle pedal blocks,It worked so the kids could comfortable reach the pedals on their tricycles. The only drawback was the blocks were a little loose.
3,Just OK,This book starts out pretty good but turns out to be very predictable. It also jumps around alot - the chapters being one or two pages mostly doesn't help in my opinion.
5,Stone,Excellent book. I watched the movies before I read the books and it was nice to be able to put faces with the characters in this case (since I enjoy Tom Selleck as an actor).
3,Not bad!,"A very young girl is discovered floating in a pond shot in the head, wearing only one shoe. Good beginning to a mystery. This is my first Parker read outside of Spenser. Jesse was likable. An ageing boy of summer with a good heart. Parker's compact dialogue between cops was very amusing. Jesse's relationship with his ex-wife was exasperating but, tied with his alcoholic baggage, it was understandable. Jesse did not have a Hawk or a Joe Pike to lean on. Too bad. I read this in one long afternoon watching football. Mr Parker can always be counted on for a decent read."
3,"Entertaining, but light...","Death in Paradise by Robert Parker is a very entertaining, but very light mystery. We follow the exploits of Paradise chief of police, Jesse Stone, as he tries to solve a murder mystery, get his drinking under control and get his love life on track. While Parker's dialogue is first rate, it seems to read more like a screenplay than a novel. Also, the plot seems to resolve itself just a little too quickly. My biggest complaint, however, is all the wasted paper. With 1 to 1-1/2 blank pages between each chapter--and we're talking 66 chapters and almost 300 pages here, it's almost as if Parker tried to make a novella into something larger. So for Parker fans, you'll enjoy this book but don't expect a deep, complicated or dramatic mystery."
5,Funniest Man There Ever Was!!!,"I adored Richard Jeni and wish he was still around. Everything he did was hysterical, including this VHS tape. Wish it was available on DVD, but since it isn't, I bought it in whatever form I could. I want to own everything that was ever recorded by him."
4,Good Pads,This Pads are really good to use! but just sometimes it doen't stick much on material!!So you can try to use atleast once!
4,"Soft, not scratchy",These disposable pads are soft and not at all scratchy or irritating on the skin. I would definitely order these again.
3,Leaky,A lot of pads in the box but they don't seem to hold the leaky milk for me. Frequently had to change the pads. They also bunch up in my nursing bra. Still searching for the right nursing pads...
5,Great Nursing Pads,I checked out all the reviews for nursing pads and decided to buy these. I have already gone through three boxes. They are soft and comfortable and even though they are a bit thick I was surprised to find that they did not show through my nursing bra/shirt. And so far have not had any leaks.
1,smell like diesel !!!,"They smell horrible, like diesel! This can't be healthy! I cannot understand how all these good reviews exist about this product! And after a couple of hours my breasts are red and I feel itchy.. terrible product! Tommee tippee were much much better!"
4,Great Nursing Pads,"I have used these since I had my sons, and they are great for leakage. They hold a ton of milk and lock moisture in well so you don't feel wet. They have sticky tabs on the back to secure to your clothes but I don't use them. They stay put pretty well. They even work at night, but if they shift you can leak through your shirt, or if you sleep through the night and have a big supply. I recommend these over medela,I just think they are more comfortable and discreet under clothes. The one downside is they can be a bit scratchy after awhile."
2,New design is disappointing!,"With my daughter who is now 21 months old, I swore by the Lansinoh nursing pads, but when I had my son 3 months ago and began using them again I noticed that they had changed the pads and now they're horrible! They're smaller than they were before and slide around inside your bra even though they have 2 adhesive strips now. I didn't even need to use the strips with the old design. They also crinkle up around the edges, I think due to a new curved shape, and it is SO itchy. I was seriously disappointed and am now trying to find a new brand of nursing pad."
1,The pan rusted,"This product disappointed me. The directions said it was dishwasher safe, so I ran it through the dishwasher prior to using it. When I took it out of the dishwasher I saw rust along the bottom of one whole side of the pan. I am in the process of returning this product and will purchase William Sonoma's Crown Muffin Pan instead."
1,Selena Vive,"I watched this concert and loved it. Even though I understand very little spanish, it was wonderful and had me crying. I wanted to buy it so bad, but after reading the reviews here I will not buy it. If it is not the entire show that I watched on TV then I do not want it."
5,Relax on Ipanema Beach,"Bossacucanova is known for its quirky re-creations of classic bossa nova songs. ""Ipanema Lounge"" is more relaxed, more like a nice icy capirinha on a sweltering day.From the opening song,""Lounge W"",which conjures jet-setters kicking back in Rio, to its closing extended version of ""Sanary Sur Mer"",the ""Ipanema Lounge"" is a soothing collection of acid jazz&trip-hop.; The songs flow effortlessly into one another,like waves upon the Rio beach. ""Super Ambient"" and ""Ultra Samba"" are calming,and to use a '60s lounge term,""space-age."" ""Niemayer"" sounds like a song from ""The Incredibles"" soundtrack. ""Baixo Gavea"" evokes the Carnivals in Bahia with its rhythms. Marcela Mangabeira's wordless vocalizing provides a calming sonic backdrop.""Ipanema Lounge"" is a perfect summertime soundtrack. Enjoy with a barbecue&a; cold drink!"
1,What a disappointment,"I love 2nd world war movies and zombie/horror movies, however, this film is unwatchable. Slow, weak plot and a silly ending."
1,the slowest horror movie in history,"bring a pillow! btw - if you want a horror/ war movie, check out Deathwatch. It was released about the same time, it is way better"
4,the book of The Blessed Mother at Medjugorje,"I am not finish with the book yet, but I am very interested in what the auther and the children have to say about the appearing of the Blessed Mother Mary."
5,A must read !!,"This is by far the best book I have read about the vision in Medjugorje. I took my time reading and re-reading it. The interviews with the visionaries, pilgrims and townspeople were simple but well done. The supporting scripture truly made a complete picture as to why these apparitions are so important and cannot be ignored. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to deepen their faith and renew their relationship with God. We are truly blessed to have these messages, we should receive them with an open heart."
5,Well researched and well presented,"A very comprehensive account of the wondrous Medjugorje phenomenon. One of the strengths of this book is the author having such close access to source material, in paticular the interviews with the Medjugorje visionaries. The sincerity of the visionaries comes across very powerfully. Readers new to the Medjugorje story will find this a marvellous introduction and those already familiar will find much to be inspired by.However, one must be aware that interpretations in mystical experiences are always very subjective and should be approached with prayerful open-mindedness.Also, there are one or two instances of factual misinformation - for example the claim that Padre Pio made a prediction of three days of world darkness. Padre Pio never made this prediction.Overall, this is a splendid account of the wonder of Medjugorje.James Mulligan"
3,Natural ?,"Okay... so it tastes great. Natural? Maybe not so great. How natural is SODIUM HEXAMETAPHOSPHATE (TO PROTECT FLAVOR), PHOSPHORIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE AND POTASSIUM BENZOATE (PRESERVE FRESHNESS), ASCORBIC ACID (TO PROTECT FLAVOR), ASPARTAME, ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, CALCIUM DISODIUM EDTA (TO PROTECT FLAVOR), CARAMEL COLOR, YELLOW 5, BLUE 1.Don't forget to read the small print on the labels!"
4,Addicting,"I've become addicted to anything called ""lipton diet green tea"". I don't care if it's powdered or bottled or what flavor it is. I drink this stuff all day long. Naturally, I prefer to buy it by the case."
3,"Have car, buy repair book","I prefer a Haynes repair book, but bought a Chilton so I have both for my truck and SUV. Often pictures you need or repair instructions on a particular repair aren't there and you go hunting the Internet for answers and diagrams. But Haynes and Chilton are the best there is so you take pot luck. When I buy a car I always buy a repair manual if for no other reason than the repair shop can't take me for a ride (and they do lie about repairs and sometimes don't do them or do them improperly, with one of these manuals you'll be ""informed""). If there was a better manual I'd buy it. So far, there isn't."
1,u get wht u pay for,when i looked at this product i thought that i was getting all the songs that i was told. i was completely wrong and now im stuck with a album that dont have all the songs that i wanted
2,Get the spray instead,"I bought the wipes because I figured they would be convenient. I'm sure they would be, if I could get them out of the container properly. No matter how hard I try they wad up and tear or all come out at once. I liked the idea of a biodegradable wipe and the packaging is cute, just not functional. Call me crazy but I like a functional package.Now I remove the whole lid instead of feeding the wipes through the dispensing hole. It works, but not as convenient as I hoped. Next time I'll get the spray cleaner and use a washable microfiber cloth."
1,This book leads to more questions than answers.,"The book is quite inconsistent in the way it dealswith the different applications. I have to say that the author is pretty much on the mark with the choice of Intranet Applications in large/medium corporations. I was also frustrated with the amount of time it took to load different apps from the cdrom only to find the access databases were corrupt/bad. The author's site did not have any ftp access to either the code or databases. The couple examples that I did try on the author's web site also did not work. I also have Ben Forta's book, which I would rate slightly higher than this one, but not by much.I would really urge all these programmers turned authors to get the book on Java by Mary Campione et al, for a well written book and which is easy to understand. This is not rocket science!"
2,Weak,"Desborough's CF book features what all developers look for in computer books - oodles of sample code. Unfortunately, the applications contained in the book are poorly documented and somewhat misleading -- some of them contain CF 1.5 syntax (the product is now in rev 3.0).Of course, I could forgive this shortcoming if the samples were sufficiently complex as to demonstrate new techniques and intriguing user interfaces. The book fails here too, however, as most of the examples do not even use frames, although a few do demonstrate use of Style Sheets.A programmer just starting out with CF may consider purchasing this book as a companion to the Cold Fusion Web Database Construction Kit by Ben Forta, et al., however, experienced CF developers will find it a disappointment.Steve DruckerCo-Author, The CF Web Database Construction Ki"
2,"All code, No explanation or index","I wanted to learn CF and have a reference. I got neither. I will be returning this to the bookstore from whence it came. Yeah, it has a lot of sample code. I can find sample code all over the net for free."
1,Is there an editor in the house?,"Forget about all the code errors. Poor grammar, misunderstanding of word meanings, and cornball (and utterly unnecessary) interjections make this book painful to read."
4,Even though,"this is the oldest one out of the best lesbian erotica series, there were some stories in here that were pretty hot to read. Still worth the price I got for it, and I have it hidden away for those nights when I want to read something dirty..."
3,Not a bedtime book!,"I have to say that I enjoyed this book even though it was not an ""easy read"". The stories of Csanyi's own dogs were amusing - and he pointed out reasonable explanations for their behavior. I agree with some of his theories such as: Dogs were domestically bred to understand and communicate with humans. Makes sense although he does go a bit too far. The experiments were interesting, the study of ethology being what it is. Interesting book but not for the novice."
3,has to be modified to fit,The cardboard around the inlet opening does not fit and has to be cut somewhat to allow for a decent fit in the vacuum. Does not fit as well as Kenmore bags.
3,Good but the sound rules it out.,"Janson's live M6 is a decent performance that is fairly competitive, but the dry and brittle sound quality turns me off. I shouldn't be surprised; all of these LSO releases have terrible sound due to the super dry acoustics of the Barbican. The violins have no depth and there's precious little air around the orchestra. Fisher, Eschenbach, Herbig and Bertini are the best M6 I've heard."
3,Interesting but not what you would expect,"First off I what to say I love this but If you add the dragon, half-dragons, or sragon slayers to other campaines it would shift strengh from one side to the other. But it is still usefull if you do a all dragon campaine."
3,not for overnight,these are good for daytime use but not for overnight the leg holes are too loose and get even looser when wet
2,Disappointed.,"I recently fractured my hip, and since it takes a bit of time to get up and go to the bathroom (especially at night), I wanted heavy duty protection so I wouldn't wake up in a puddle. Well, this product didn't do it for me. The first piddle at 2:00 am went up and out the leg opening. Plus, these REALLY smell, worse than Depends, and much worse than Tena brand. I'll go back to Tena for nights, and use these for daytime I guess."
3,Cuctomer review,A lot of background information on whitetail deer. Not a lot of excitement (only 2 hunts are shown).
1,Rubbish,"I bought this thinking it was a nice tan custom fit floor mat for the driver seat area. What arrived was a generic looking black vinal strip that might fit across the rear seating area of any vehicle. I returned it within an hour after it arrived, pure rubbish. For a few $ more, you can get a nice fitting set for a whole vehicle, front and rear."
2,My cat wasn't impressed,"In theory this seemed like a great toy, but my cat didn't seem impressed with it. i put a few toys in it and he walked right over and took them out and just looked at me. Maybe its more for a kitten who is more curious, but it seemed my kitty was a bit to advanced to enjoy this. He likes playing with a twist tie or a a ball a lot more. Maybe this is more for cats who don't want to run around ???Overall the product is solid and will probably last forever."
1,cats were not interested in this,"Our two Siamese kittens, who were 4 months old when we got this toy box, were not very interested at all. Big disappointment. We added a few pieces of dry kibble inside the box and there was only mild interest for a few moments, then they walked away. We left the box out for a few days but they ignored it. We put it away for a month, tried again. Absolutely no interest. We added a few kitty treats to the inside of the box and put a couple cute toy mice sticking half-way out of two holes. No interest. We put the box away again. Now the cats are 8 months old, we tried one more time. The cats could care less. Will be giving this to a friend who has two rescue kittens, maybe they'll appreciate the toy box."
3,Teach and Play,"This toy does require that you spend time teaching your cats how to play with it. Also, my three cats will play with this item more if I play with them. Only one of my three cats will play with this toy all on his own (that I've observed). I will say, when I get up in the morning, there is evidence they have played with it while I was sleeping (balls are out on the floor). But they really do play with it more if I play with them."
3,Good product,My cats loved it the first day. They aren't as interested now in the toys inside but still enjoy it when I throw in treats and they get to hunt for them.
4,The cats love it but the ball comes out too easily and ends up somewhere else in the house,"The cats have enjoyed figuring out where the ball is in the box. But have now also figured out they can get the ball out of the side holes quite easily. While they still enjoy this toy, I would enjoy it more if the ball stayed in the box!"
3,My cats got board,"Was a hit for a short time, now sits in a corner and they don't play with it at all."
1,Please check product thoroughly....before allowing cats to use!!,"Received just days ago and later noticed sharp slivers of wood all around the wood box....they were coming out from the underside edges of the circles cut for your cats paws to enter to retieve the toys..I picked up the box and EVERY precut circlehad splinters of wood protruding the underside....I tried to pick them all off of every circular hole with my fingers ,and each circular hole had at least 2-3 slivers...but I still felt very uncomfortable letting my young cats play with this and possibly injuring themselves.This company really needs to look into this issue as it is a major hazard to your loved cats!!! PLEASE, if purchasing check under each hole to remove the loose wood slivers..."
4,cats loved it,"My cats really like this toy. I put their dental chews in it at night and they love to go and ""hunt"" for them."
5,Great for owners low on energy,"My cats get up to trouble if they don't get enough play time, but I don't always have the energy to run around the house with them. I like this puzzle box because I can pop in a few toys or treats and watch them go at it. Old toys they've lost interest in, or never liked in the first place, like jingly balls and little toy mice, gain a new life in this box when they're just out of reach. I've read other reviews that mention sharp edges and nails, but the one I received is totally smooth, with rounded corners and edges. It looks well-constructed and I haven't had any issues with it in the six months or so since I bought it. Definitely one of the more useful and longer-lasting cat toys I've purchased."
4,A thought toy for cats,It's amazing how quickly they learn to get the balls out. It's also amazing how popular this toy remains even after its mastered.
4,Cats will be cats,"The box was very nicely made and I have no complaints about the product itself. My cats were not interested in it at all, so I took it to my in-laws house and their cat LOVES it. So, as is to be expected with all cat products, there is no guarantee that your cats will like it, but if they do, this is a great product."
3,careful!,"My Bengal cats love to play with this. Kittens have no problem with it, however my larger cats have gotten their arms stuck when they reach in and jump away with the heavy box attached to them. I wouldn't advise buying this for a cat unless you supervise the play with it. I would advise it for a kitten anytime as they can slide their arms and paws in and out without difficulty and it gives them the interactive ""hunting"" play part they need to develop."
4,the cats love it,"First, if you are handy with wood this is a very simple product. Just a wooden box with holes drilled in and toys stuffed inside for the cats to remove. So, if you have a handy husband consider that route.If however, your husband is not handy, or doesn't have the time to spare ..... this is a nice product. The finish is very smooth, no rough edges. And the cats really do seem to enjoy taking the toys out of the holes. Plus I get exercise going through the house to find the toys and stuff them back into the holes.In conclusion, the cats enjoy it, and the humans get more exercise. It is a win win situation. I recommend this product to all ""over the top"" cat parents. I removed one star because I feel as though the price is a little high for what the product cost to manufacture."
2,Didn't hold their interest..........,Unfortunately this was interesting to my two for all of about 15 minutes. I think it's too easy to get the toys out. Needs to present more of a challenge.
1,Cat has never played with it,"I have a 2 year old very playful cat who plays with all toys i buy him. I was excited to buy this for him. I put other toys, even treats inside, he just starred at it, put his hand in for 3 seconds, walked away, I have had it out for 1 month and he does not play with it. I have encouraged him and he hates it. Waste of money."
4,Entertaining anecdotes covering rise and fall of the ABA,"Basically, an anecdotal history of the ABA. Pluto is anNBA columnist for the Cavs (if I remember correctly) andhe interviews a myriad of folks regarding the players,coaches and owners. Larry Brown, Doug Moe, Pat Boone,Bob Costas, Fly Williams... they're all here in tragicomedythat ends up being coalesced into the NBA."
1,Ruined our meal. Anyone actually eat this stuff?,We purhcased a can of this sauce from Walmart to make enchiladas with. No one would eat their meal because this sauce tasted so bad. Not only does it taste bad it is also much hotter than a mild sauce. Unless your taste buds are broke I would not purchase this stuff.
1,listing wrong,"The listing showed this book as being the leather bound smaller sized version. They corrected the leather bound part of the listing but this is still the full sized pew version, not the smaller personal version shown in the dimensions here.If you want a standard bound, standard sized book this one is just what you want, nothing wrong with it."
5,Well built and thought microwave oven,"I have purchased this microwave and used it for over a year. I really like it, and it is packed with nice features and well built.Highlights:- bright LED that displays the time and cooking settings. It has 2 colors: green and red.(compared to a LCD on most cheaper ovens - I am not mentioning mechanical jogs ones).- Nice handle to open and close the oven door- 800W cooking power: it has been plenty for me, and it is power efficient on the electrical bill side.- Supports multi-stage cooking with preselections- Original design- Easy to clean touchpad- Nice build quality, no loose parts- Turn table of over 10 inches is a quite respectable size for this oven.- Reduced footprint on the counter top space."
3,Does the job,"The microwave does the job. It reheats microwaveable food well, and defrosts frozen items. It looks nice, and is compact (for America - Europeans beware, this is normal size for Europe). The downsides: it is loud, the beeper never goes off, and the white handle is a bit flimsy. When I pull on it, I always feel like it might snap off, though it really won't. For such an expensive microwave, I would have expected better quality. Re design, it's the only nice looking white microwave I could find on Amazon. Re price, I didn't research other options very much, as I had a gift certificate, but from past experience, if you just need something to reheat microwave food, you might be able to find something cheaper (perhaps less stylish or small)."
2,Work book written in,I realize that I was buying a used book. But you shouldn't try to sell a workbook this is 1/3 of the way completed. These lessons are useless for my daughter to complete since they were already done. You should please inform the buyer that x amount of assignment have been completed.
5,Six Stars!!!,"I've got to admit, for a first time author, L.K. Malone did an outstanding job! I began reading at 3:00 pm and ended it about 10:30 pm!!! The storyline is full of mystery and suspense. You don't truly get all the answers until the last two pages. I highly recomend this very well written novel."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered 2 50"" racks. One was missing an end cap and all of the nuts & bolts to put it together. I've emailed customer service 4 times and called. Still haven't received a return call or the missing parts. I guess I'll have to go buy them myself. Terrible customer service."
2,Stunningly dated and poor translation,"If this is your introduction to Homer or The Iliad, please, I am begging here, avoid this ancient translation. Spend the money on Lombardi's version, or for something more high-brow, on Fagles's."
3,The Illiodic Prequel to the Odyssey,"If you haven't read this book, and are hoping its gonna be another Odyssey, you'll be dissapointed. It is pretty good, but the story is set during the last of the Trojan War. The story revolves around Achilles, the friend of Odysseus, who is practically a god among men. He and Odysseus and others are fighting at Troy for the sake of Queen Helen, the mother of Achilles. The story is a little boring, but the words are great, and I think it would be nice to hear sitting around a campfire listening to a blind storyteller singing it."
4,Bach Rules!,"I don't know what possessed the first reviewer to be so vociferous in critiquing this album. In fact, this is a delightful reinterp of Bach's music. Very danceable and joyous. Maybe it helps that I am not expecting anything in particular from Stoltzman. This album swings. If the first reviewer thought it would appeal only to college kids on acid, he is way wrong. His review sounds like he was on stomnach acid. Lighten up!"
3,"A Blessing, But a Challenge to Read","This book deals with the very important topic of traditional large families. It does shed some light, but frankly I expected more. I would have thought that on such a down-to-earth topic, there would be much to share, but Dr. Diamond treats this in a ...clinical fashion.His approach is rather academic and abstract. Everything is spoken of in general terms and did not engage me. Compare this with a book like 'Rome Sweet Home' by Scott and Kimberly Hahn. The Hahns really share from their heart and draw you in to their story.The chapters are systematically divided but there are no sections to further help you suss out important info. Also, the biblical basis of having a large family is not dealt with. That's another strike against this book. Dr. Diamond is a professional and he writes like it.Because of the paucity of information on this topic, I would still recommend this book. But I'm certainly on the lookout for others."
5,Vacuum Bags,"I went ALL the way to the store to buy these and found out they were OUT of stock,but good for me becauseI found a better deal on Amazon!"
3,Vacuum bags,"Kind of hard to rate when I haven't used them yet. Just bought them because of the good price. it's identical to what I've been using, so it's got to be good."
2,MIght have data to back it----but kids refuse it,"I have a 9 year old and 6 year old who REFUSE to take it. Tried hiding it in smoothie/protein shakes for a while until my older son discovered me. It is an oil and tastes like it. It may work for those who take it, but my kids refuse."
5,"Lovely, sexy stories",An entire book full of the talent and unique voice and imagination that is Cecelia Tan -- what a treat!
4,I Beg To Differ...,"... I actually prefer this one to DEATH IN THE GARDEN. DITG got unwieldy and tiresome; this one, OTOH, I could not put down. True, I tend to skim a bit in Ironside's works, which I normally would not do. (Her descriptions can get loooong); but I found Zita absorbing, even her ""European"" (as another reviewer wrote) love for shoes. I also found Xenia totally repugnant, yet still had to read about her doings and motivations. Actually, the most repellent character to me would end up being a tie between Stevens and Valentina! (Gack! ""Suede"" skin on his bald head? I am revolted yet fascinated by that. His obsessions are dangerous, and he is just boorish.)(Valentina is so self-concerned it is almost incredible, and yet, don't we all know people like that?)"
1,Completely boring,"Now that both shows have ended, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of ""Heat"". I am extremely disappointed because there doesn't seem to be a story in this book. Nancy Holder substituted story telling with overblown, immature romantic angst which is completely inconsistent with any of the characters that I love.The only word that can truthfully describe ""Heat"" is boring.I couldn't care less who Buffy loves. I only care about good story telling. The only people who could enjoy this book are people who only care about whether or not Buffy and Angel end up together. If you actually care about interesting plot and character development, then this book is not for you."
2,2 /12 stars,"It's a little better than two stars but not up to 3 stars. The book loses focus when dealing with the Chinese subplot and meanders a bit in the middle. Plus, the MoGs are not written very well which makes some of the LA scenes boring.Crossover books are hard to do and Nancy Holden makes a valiant effort to make all the characters interesting and give them something important to do but she ends up losing the rhythm of the book and I was bored two quarters of the way through and sort of dozed off for the last part!"
1,Buffy's STILL in love with Spike!,"For the B/A fans who claim that Buffy did not love Spike, watch First Date. Buffy says ""why does everyone think I'm STILL in love with Spike."" Case closed. Stop lecturing Spuffies on not watching eps when it's you guys who haven't.As for Buffy loving Angel, well, the Immortal is eating cookie dough while Angel waits and waits."
2,Good news/Bad news,"The good news is that someone has finally taught Nancy Holder how to write a paragraph more than a sentence long. The bad news is that this novel has too little of Buffy and and much less of Angel. Those of you who like to see Buffy and Angel together will be disappointed. There are many bad guys and half the novel is written from their point of view. And yes, they are predictable and tiresome. At one point the novel comes to a screeching halt when Holder takes an entire chapter (Chapter 11) to write a fairy-tale style backstory about those bad guys. I skimmed through, not wanting to waste my time on that. It was merely a repetition of what had already been established. Lots of repetition--what characters go through, they run to report to others. I was so hoping that the last Buffy/Angel crossover book would be better."
1,Unhappy Buffy/Spike shipper,I wish Nancy Holder no ill will but I'm a Buffy/Spike shipper and can't get into a book that's has this much lovey-dovey B/A content. I just can't get past that to enjoy the book. Wished she would have toned it down a bit but I gave up trying to finish reading the novel bookstore and sadly reshelved it.I very much want the books to continue but I won't buy books like this.
3,Rushed by the publisher?,"Nancy Holder generally writes delightfully ""Child of the Hunt"" and ""The Gatekeeper Trilogy"" are wonderful examples.I bought ""Heat"" to support the continuance of Buffy related literary efforts but found it is not up to Ms. Holder's usual quality of writing. The language is too cutesy even for a Buffy book and the real-life ""shoutouts"" are too heavy handed. I wonder if there was a certain push on the part of the publisher to get the book out denying Ms. Holder the opportunity for polish.The story iteself was quite enjoyable but again, timing, being set in the twilight of both series the window for including all the characters was too narrow. A reader strongly familiar with both shows might find themselves distracted by trying to fit the action into the series' timelines.Overall, a fun book, just not up to the usual Holder quality."
4,Enter with an Open Mind,"This book is channeled material and offers a new perspective on the time period during Jesus' life as a prophet. It pushes the boundaries of the more accepted Christian version of the story of Jesus while describing the repression and ""position"" of women at that time.Though I am skeptical of anyone who claims to channel beings...I read this book with an open mind. Since this book did not claim to teach a ""way to believe"", only to share a story, I remained open to what the author wanted to share. If anything, it would have been great to learn more about Mary Magdalene's views of her own experiences with healing and herbs and how this helped form her life, rather than so many pages on how she aligned with Jesus' teachings...but maybe that's another book."
3,Problems With Bottle Design,"I love all Method products. But sometimes I do think they need to test their packaging designs a little further before marketing. This product is a perfect example. It looks cool sitting on my countertop, but the bottle design is awkward and hard to grasp, especially if my hands are wet. The top is difficult to twist open also because you can't tell whether it's open or shut. And the worse, the opening clogs up like crazy and has to be constantly cleaned out to be able to dispense the product."
2,"Good Soap, Poor Packaging.","Ok, the soap works fairly well but I need to rant somewhere about the bottle design. Imagine picking this thing up with soapy wet hands. You can't hold on to it. You'll also need to rinse and dry the bottle and your hands completely to grip and thus open the top. This is the most rediculously designed soap product packaging I've ever encountered."
1,irrelevant,"I just finished interviewing at Microsoft. They do not use the brain teasers any more. So while the book may be ""interesting"", it's dated and irrelevant."
4,An education about puzzle-like interview ...,"Even though Microsoft is no longer the king of software, you may think that this book is a bit dated. To my pleasant surprise, I found this book to be very interesting and well written. It gives you a brief history of interviewing and Microsoft's (I guess you can probably replace Microsoft with companies like Google, Amazon or many high-tech/financial company etc.) Cult of Puzzle. Hopefully you are not reading this book just to get the answers. I actually read the whole book and look at the answers last. I am not a big fan of of puzzle-like interviews, but after reading the book, at least I know where that idea originated from. I especially like the interviewers/HR section since those issues are rarely discussed. Highly recommended!"
4,The Journey,"This book is a good start for Microsoft reviews, but it is outdated. Puzzles are used less often, for several reasons. One of the reasons, which the book starts with and then gets stuck, is that it is the journey of trying to solve seemingly impossible problems. Unfortunately, with more people memorizing all the puzzles, MS and others are switching gears. So, if you want some of the problems, with solutions, this might be the book for you. If you want a job at MS, I would suggest visiting MSDN at the MS site and look around."
4,Interesting book especially if you like puzzles ...,"I have read various sections of this book, but haven't read it cover-to-cover. So, take this review with a big grain of salt.The puzzles are interesting. Some of them are quite well known, especially in the programming fraternity. Some of them are just plain well known to everyone. But, they are interesting to think about no matter what. It is also interesting to know how/why the MS used puzzles in their interviewing. I am not sure they still use them.In my opinion, using geneirc puzzles for an interview might probably not be the best thing to do. If not from this book, there are various sources for people to know how to solve them. And more often than not, once you have seen/known how to solve the puzzle, chances are you can solve it anytime later!But, this is a good book to have around. Good way to impress your friends by throwing around some puzzles they can't solve quickly."
3,White trash in space?,"What if you could save the planet, but you had to do things that you might not agree too? The idea of cheap space exploration is nothing new, but what happens when the people who do leave the planet cause problems to the planet that they leave. This is one of those issues that have been explored in many other books, but Oltion does it in a surprisingly refreshing way. Equipping your pickup truck with an interstellar drive, is a unique way of doing things, but what if you really didn't want to save the earth? If you liked the Getaway Special, you will probably like this book as well. In some cases the writing could focus a bit less on detail and more on plot or characters, and something about a pickup truck, interstellar drives, and the need for beer evokes the idea of interstellar white trash, but then you can't have it all."
1,Not so sexy...,"I picked up a pack of these at the checkout line when shorts weather arrived. The first one I used tore up my legs pretty badly; worse than I have experienced since I shaved off my goosebumps right before a game as a cheerleader. I thought it might be just one flawed razor in the pack, as they advertise such smooth results. But I just used a second one, and my legs are covered in nicks. If I could post a photo, you would be amazed. This episode was not goosebump-related. I will never purchase this brand again."
1,Great book for kids,"This is a great book. Unfortunately, the book does not have all the pages. It starts with Page 274 and then goes to the end and then the pages repeat from 274 again. The book arrived in decent shape. But I found out about the issue only about 30 days after I received it when my kid complained about it. Too late to return it. The reason for the 1 star is the printing defect. I cannot blame the seller because it is possible that they were not aware of it."
4,good for dry brushing,"This brush would be perfect if the handle was a little shorter and thicker. The brush head is fabulous though. The handle was hard to get on, I had to whack it with a hammer to get it to stay."
4,Great product - dent on the second pan as well,"Seems to be what I was expecting, but previous reviews mentioned the second pan was dented. Mine too. Not enough to send back, but it seems like a pattern."
4,"Extremely rugged, high quality, but hard to keep clean","These jelly roll/sheet pans are extremely well built. They are very heavy and thick, do not warp, and should last a lifetime. They are the highest quality I have found, and I've owned many different brands.Be aware though, that they are NOT in any way non-stick, and are hard to keep clean. If you don't mind breaking out the steel wool to keep these in shape, they are excellent - if you are looking for something that's easy maintenance, however, go with non-stick. Of course, none of the non-stick ones will last anywhere near as long, as the teflon finish wears off any cookware after a while."
4,workhorses,"but for some discoloration I""m very pleased - they nest well, and are roomy.I think they're also a good weight - not too heavy but sturdy"
5,Awesome,These pans were delivered quickly and and wonderful. They are a great value for the money - they are very heavy duty and I expect they will hold up for many years to come.
2,Basically flawed,"I have not read the second edition of this book, but my experience of the first edition when reading for my economics doctorate was that it was not an easy book to use. In particular, it had a rather ideosyncratic view of the literature. Certainly, it is curious that there are two pages of references to the Author's work and less that one of Maddala, Arrelano, Bond, Pesaran and Smith combined.I found that ""Analysis of Panel Data"" by Cheng Hsiao combined with a few choice papers was a more useful strategy. The first edition of Hsiao has been a classic since it was released in the mid eighties and dispite it being an Econometric Society monograph, is much clearer and easier to understand. It has now been updated to include dynamic and discrete response models and will, I believe, remain the classic Panel Data text for years to come, although I have not read Arellano's book."
3,Objects in rear view mirror are smaller than they appear...,First off I apologize for my corny title.When I got the multimedia rack assembled I was a bit disappointed in it's size & capacity. Apparently I didn't look close enough at the dimensions on the site but this was a bit smaller than I expected. But moving beyond that it's an attractive & versatile item. Some of the holes to put the pegs in to hold the shelves didn't seem to be drilled the same & I was unable to get the pegs in fully but they still hold well enough. The glue it came with to hold the wooden pegs to hold the sides of the unit to the base was dry & unusable but I used regular Elmers glue & that worked fine. Also when putting the shelves in place you have to be careful not to wreck the finish on the sides. But a little black permanent marker fixes any nicks quite well.
3,Not for nurses,"I ordered this book thinking that it would help me to develop and centralize case management in an insurance company. This book is really for non-medical hospital management personnel. The focus is on hospital case management only, with a side on home health as it relates to the discharged hospital patient. For what it is, I think the price is too high and I returned it."
1,Don't believe the hype.,I tried this on my plasma tv and it only got worse. Product did not perform as prescribed.
3,Rather Esoteric,"After reading about half this book, I just put it aside. Chris makes good points and hits home on the need to steer marketing in a direction that is better aligned with peoples' needs, helping them do what they want to do instead of bombarding them with junk.It's rather philosophical, too much so for my taste. If you like that style of writing and have an interest in Locke's ideas, you may love this book.Personally, I loved Cluetrain, and one day may pick up where I left off in Gonzo. If you're thinkin' about buying Gonzo, go for it. It's cool, it's different, got some great ideas, but just wasn't my style."
4,Aaron Sulkey's review,"I thought this book was very good, but it was dragged out a little. It kept me reading so then I could see what was going to happen next. The book was about a young man, Francis Cassevant, who went to war and jumped on a grenade and blew his face up. People stare at him in horror in the streets in the town of Frenchtown. He meets a girl and they become good friends and likes her deeply but, she just likes him as a friend. He becomes a champion at table tennis and beats his old friend for the championship. He also wants to kill his old hero, but you will have to read the book to see what happens and see if he kills his old hero or if he gets killed."
3,The Heroes Of Our Lives,"Don`t let this book mislead you into thinking that this takes place in a war type plot.It is said to be impossible to live the life of a normal man without a face, but as this person describes the events he seems to be a normal man. He describes the life of a normal man as being himself, but as the story progresses the reader is led on to the fact that he is not normal at all. I enjoyed this book because of the fact that he tells the life of a man that is different from all others but lives the same."
4,On Grief and Grieving,I was very pleased with the service and the books arrived on time and was everything I expected. I haver purchased other items previusly and have always been pleased both with product and service.
5,Excellent resource for anyone dealing with a loss.,this is an excellent book which has helped me with the loss of my mother. I have purchased it for others I know who have lost loved ones. It is well-written and organized in such a way that you can use it as a reference after reading it cover to cover. I highly recommend the book to anyone struggling with grief in our culture.
4,A learning process,"This is a cup of espresso, bien pressé, serve really hot by the street side at the bar of a little coffee shop in a very big city in the middle of an ever changing universe. Early in the morning or so very late at night...Bojo last offering offers the same eclectic ""vision"" then their first album but this it has a more constructed liberty to it. If their first album was very interesting in his research of sounds and atmosphere, it doesn't have the same continuity then the second has. And adding more ""concrete"" voices really complete Bojo sound landscape.I will place this album somewhere between Paolo Conte and the Art of Noise on my CD shelf."
1,Defective out of the box,"Printer immediately displayed printer error after first powerup. I noticed print heads seemed stuck so I gave them some gentle assistance. Next powerup seemed normal, hooray!. Unpacked and installed ink, pressed ok to continue...ink cartridges could not be detected. Double checked installation, reseated all cartridges, same result.Called Epson and described the problem, they immediately offered to send new printer (sounds like a known issue). Currently waiting for delivery. Hoping for a better result."
3,"Excellent printer, uses too much ink.",I bought this printer on 14th December. It is January 7th and already out of ink. I've printed less than 50 text pages and about 5 photos although the photos are excellent.Everytime I print something it cleans the heads and the indicated tank level drops by about 10%. All six of the tanks have dropped by the same amount so its not from printing.Do I spend $120 on the larger inks so that it has clean heads for a whole month or find a different printer?
1,The Worst Amazon Purchase I've ever Made,"When I first received the item the box was practically destroyed. The product was in pieces and there was broken packing materiel jammed inside of the printer which did not allow me to print when I received the product. The primary reason for this purchase was to print on DVDs and CD and the CD/DVD Tray was NOT in the box. I contacted the seller and after about a week he sent me a CD/DVD tray which he obviously purchased separately to cover his tracks because it, unlike the printer was new. This product was advertised as ""Like New"" but it was dusty, and had Broken attachments! The DVD tray does NOT work properly and may not even be the correct one for this model of printer. I needed this project for an event so I've even paid a repair man to attempt to fix it, rather then send it back because of the time. I am not pleased and feel this is the worst project I've received from Amazon."
2,BAD,THE DESCRIPTION WAS COMPLETELY FALSE . IT WORKS FOR NOW BUT I CANT IMAGINE THAT WILL LAST LONG . BUTTONS BROKE ; APPEARANCE BAD ; & FUNCTIONAILTY IS LIMITED. MY ADVISE IS ONLY BUY NEW ITEMS FROM SOMEONE ELSE .
1,"BEWARE OF EPSON ""PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE""","I will never buy another Epson Product after my Epson Stylus Photo RX500 died exactly 3 years after purchase. This was a lightly used machine for household purposes only. I believe Epson pre-programs this obsolescence so that user is told ""parts inside your printer have reached the end of their life..."" There is no toll free number to call - No literature given at time of purchase deals with this event. Very very disappointed with this manufacturer."
3,noisy sucker!!,"Over the years I have had 5 Epson printers. All have been great print quality, this one is no exception. It is the noisiest, maybe the noisiest ink jet printer I have ever seen...or heard. It is BIG. Bigger then some ""all in one' printers. And the worst thing is the ink cost. I'm sure it uses the same amount of ink to do the job, but the cartridges are smaller then most and cost a more. The printer price wasn't bad, but for the cost of the ink I think Epson would make more money if they gave you the printer. Maybe my next printer will be a Canon"
1,Not very durable,"This was my wife's Christmas gift for me a year ago. Yep, you guessed it. Two weeks after the warranty expired the printer stopped functioning properly. I get an ""ink cartridge not recognized"" error. Unfortunately I bought several genuine, Epson ink cartridges to find out the problem was with the printer. Epson tells me that fixing it might cost more than a new unit.This is my fourth Epson printer and the other three lasted at least 1000 pages each. Perhaps this one has printed 150. So I'm left with the decision: fix it and salvage the $85 worth of ink laying about or just chuck everything and get something better. Even when it worked the prints weren't that inspiring. Sigh...."
5,Mystic Traveller: Excellent travel by the music,"A very special travel to splendid New Age. Ecellent melodies and musicians, a perfect record fabulously produced. A gift for the ear."
4,A fine sequel to King Kong,"The Son of Kong is no King Kong. But it tries to be just as good. The film does not feature as many dinosaurs. But, except for the brontosaurus, none of them were seen in King Kong. The only sad thing is that they don't come until the last quarter. For an hour we are treated to a subplot involving love, murder and mutiny. But once the action begins, it never lets up.If the film's producers had just had some more money, they could have made a sequel to rival the original (Though that would have been impossible).But it is still worth watching for fans of the original. It is also, in my opinion, better than most of the Kong remakes and rip offs, from King Kong V.S Godzilla to King Kong 1976."
2,Hard to read,Very hard to read and get into the characters. I couldn't go past the first chapter but I will try again in a month or two.
5,Great Cd.,"If you like DnB this is a must own. With MC Conrad and LTJ on the tables, great cd. Maybe a slight trainwreck here and there, but nothing that wouldnt make me listen to this again. Love it."
5,Attention All Health/Fitness professionals,"A book that you should not be without. Great reference, wonderful information; everyone needs this."
4,"CHIMAIRA > GREAT EP, BUT THEIR FOLLOW UP IS...","CHIMAIRA IS MY FAVORITE BAND, songs like painting the white to grey e sphere make this EP very good, but... Check out the songs of their new album, pass out of existence... It's awesome, all the songs are great: dead inside, rizzo, forced life, painting the white to grey... wait till their next release (in august or september 2001) and see one of the best albums ever. But, their EP, this present darkness, has its merits. It's a very good album tough."
4,Fun!,"We have a lot of pieces of Plan Toys road and rail systems. I anticipate mixing this in with our larger sets. One thing to note is that the textured pieces aren't reversible the way the standard road pieces are, and the pieces I got don't fit together in the pattern shown on the box. Not a huge deal, but worth noting. Also, there always seem to be some of the little tabs that hold pieces together that seem stickier than others, and this set seems to have even more than normal. My 2-year-old daughter would have a hard time building this completely on her own. All that said, this is great price - the 4x4s would probably sell for this on their own - so I'm even contemplating getting another set to add to the fun."
1,Revised Review,"I think I gave the product four stars after one or two loads of dishes, which were mostly plates and pots. I never expected it to work as well as traditional detergents, so I made adjustments like rinsing my dishes extra, extra well and switching to the normal cycle. I realized that what worked best was two cubes in the light cycle. After having to use twice as much product to wash glasses and silverware, I realized it wasn't me -- it was the product. As the previous reviewer noted, the cubes just don't work well in hard water. I can't wait to get through the last of the cubes so I can switch back to Cascade. Since I have to use two per light wash sycle, it shouldn't take me long."
3,Andrew vs. Henry,"The book arrived in pretty good condition and on time. It was a very dry read, a read I did not in fact read. I don't like history and I would not recommend this book to anyone for fun."
4,If you're serious about tracking,Tracking Dog: Theory and Method gives excellent insight into what makes a tracking dog and how to become an accomplished handler.
5,Excellent Resource,This book is an excellent resource and a very interesting read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in tracking.
3,Good (Not Great) Read.,"After reading The Red Tent (several years ago) I quickly added it to my all-time favorites list. To be honest, I've been hesitatant to read Good Harbor ever since. I didn't want to be disappointed and the magnitude of The Red Tent certainly set the bar high.This was a good (not great) read. I found the ending to be somewhat abrupt and felt quite a few were unfinished. I liked the characters but thought that their friendship was almost too quickly developed. I don't know too many people that become friends as quickly as Joyce and Katherine became friends.I enjoyed the depth of the characters but wish that the book was 100 pages longer. That being said, if Anita Damant happens to write something else I'll be sure to read it more quickly. I've had this book for years and have started it twice without getting more than 20 pages into it. In the end I'm glad I finished it and while it won't be added to my favorites list, I will pass it along to my friends to read."
4,"Subtle, Character-Driven","Anita Diamont has written a relationship book that is both well written and subtle in describing a burgeoning friendship between two mature women. This book tells us without actually hammering at us that it takes work to establish and nourish a friendship. The two women are near opposites with only their religion in common, but over the course of a summer in Glouchester, MA, they cement what will, no doubt, be a life-long friendship.The author's writing style is wonderfully simple and the book is fast paced. It is a book that you will take with you wherever you go hoping to catch a few minutes to read another page or chapter."
4,A good read,I loved this book! Although it can't be compared to the Red Tent -- lets not compare apples to oranges. It was enjoyable and a fast read. The characters in the book became very real. The writing flowed easily. One of the more enjoyable books I've read this year. Definitely recommended.
3,"More Balance, Please!","I read this when it was first published and couldn't put it down. However, a lingering, annoying problem has stayed with me and it has colored my opinion of the book. As a breast cancer survivor, I was very dismayed that the author depicted an unbalanced view of radiation treatment and of the breast cancer experience in general. While her character had a very rough time of it, physically and emotionally, not everyone does. (AAnd for some it is even worse!) For me, the experience was not nearly as difficult to endure. If Diamant would have depicted a breast cancer support group throughout the book in which women suffering from a wide range of scenarios reflected on their varied experiences, I feel the book would be more successful, and helpful as well. As is it, a reade who has not had breast cancer leaves with a too-scary and very slanted picture of the breast cancer experience."
1,Strictly a Novelty item,"I decided to test this item against a real breathalyzer- when my true BAC hit .14, this analyzer still showed me to have a .03 BAC. I will try to return this as faulty."
2,"Comfortable, but very cheaply made.","I like the size of this and the comfort it provides my wrist, but it broke the second I unpacked it.The underside of this is made of plastic, with two plastic balls that help the wrist pad move. There is a limit to how far this can travel, but the limiting plastic piece broke right away. The plastic roller balls have flat spots on them from the manufacturing process, so the rolling motion is clunky at best.The pad part is contoured and fits my wrist nicely. The size is perfect. I wish they made this in a non-moving variety."
3,Scroll button,"PROI received the I-pen and the time promised, and there was no learning curve as a previous review stated. The I-pen is basically plug and play. You just have to get accustomed to the sensitivity of the mouse.CONThe writing feature does not seem to work with Windows 7. The CD supplied just did not load. The hand writing feature just did not work. The mouse feature works well. The main draw back is that I still need to have a mouse handy, for there are no scroll features on the I-pen.Overall it has improved my drawing time on certain projects. I will be waiting patiently for the company to make it compliant with Windows 7 and install the scroll feature."
3,beginner artist,this item was very easy to install. it is better than drawing with a mouse. takes some getting used to. cord is a little cumbersome. Great for kids!
3,"Its ok, I guess","My son used this for a few weeks and then gave it to a friend because he found something that works much better for his needs. The wacom bamboo graphics tablet is ""way better""."
3,Not bad for the money,"I intended to use this during on-line meetings/conferences while giving presentations. Doesn't work well for any precision tasks or writing, but can use it to draw basic lines and pointers. Considering the price, it does pretty well."
3,Great as a mouse. Not so much for a drawing tool.,"I would recommend paying the extra $60 and getting a small Wacom. With the pen you have to actually press down as if it were a mouse button, whereas the Wacom starts drawing as soon as you touch the tablet. One thing I will use this pen for is a laptop mouse. Having the freedom to use it on almost any surface is nice when you're out and about and dont feel like getting your mouse dirty or using your trackpad. As a mouse, it's awesome. As a drawing tool, forget it. Now if only they can make thing thing pressure sensitive like Wacom then I'll buy 3 of them!"
1,Hard to use,"I did not like this pen. It was hard to hold and the pad was too small for me. I kept going off the pad. Since I have use more expenses ones at school, I should have know that you get what you pay for."
2,Not a great buy,"I was looking for the ability to add signatures etc to marketing designs. This does not make the grade, it is in consistent with its ability to make a good text or jpeg . Would not buy again."
3,"Not bad, but there are better options","I was looking for a simple handwriting device to use when I do online tutoring on a whiteboard website. I have been using the genius 8 x 6 mousepen graphics tablet. The tablet works great and is cheap, but I thought if I could have a pen with no tablet it would be easier and cheaper. It works OK, but takes a lot of practice but still is not quite as legible as the tablet. You have to hold the pen just right to make it work whereas the graphics tablet is more flexible and more sensitive.It is just not quite good enough. I'll stick to the tablet, it's only about $50."
2,You might want to buy a more expensive model.,The mouse doesn't act right sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Initially it was responsive. Now it highlights everything I touch (the whole page sometimes) and it's hard to undo the highlight to make it work. I think it's probably defective. I tried it for a few days. I bought to relieve tendonitis of the inner wrist and I cannot say it's helpful for that either. Going to try a PS2 touchpad mouse instead.
4,NICE ipen,I really like this ipen because you can write it on a board but you have to buy a longer usb cord for 1.00
2,Software incompatibility,"Before you purchase the iPen and you are runnig the Windows Vista operating system be sure your only getting the Vista software version otherwise, you'll just end up spending more $$ to get it!"
2,I-Pen: Not the one I am looking for.,"I-Pen Digital Pen Writer Ipen Optical USB Mouse Input DeviceI wanted a pen which can write on the screen of the LCD monitor / laptop screen, I-Pen could not. I returned it.Otherwise the Pen/mouse worked Okay on a non-perfect surface like a grainy tably or the mouse pad they provided which had tiny back dots. Resoultion is not great. and ""click"" is cumborsome. the weight of the cable is too much inconvinient, hinders a lot while writing."
1,Will never buy and never recommend,I thought that was a great deal because the original price was $ 99.00 and I am getting it for $29.00. But after getting the pen I think its not even worth of $ 20.00. I will never buy or recommend this pen to anyone.
3,better than writing with your own blood,"the control is sloppy, nad hard to write with, the website is useless, and the tech support guy never returns phone calls. it dose function well as a mouse and is great for highlighting and pointing on the screen, the inability to add a tip to make it even more usefull. overall it's ok, really wonderful in limited space if you have carpull tunnell syndrome."
2,Bad Ending wrecks good story,"What could have easily been a 4-star rating, if not five, was was ruined by the author's poor excuse for an ending. Why, why, why did author chose this ending? My only answer is that it seemed the author must have been getting tired of writing the story and chose the quickest, easiest ending for the book. I agree wholeheartedly with R. Tamblyn's review. I was ready to recommend this book to people but I certainly won't now."
4,Day-to-day tales of old and new traditions in Bangalore,"Nothing overtly dramatic happens in this collection of eight short stories from first-time author Lavanya Sankaran, and that's pretty much the point. What we're presented with in this impressive work is an enjoyable, interesting selection of slice-of-life tales that speak to the dichotomy of life in Bangalore. Ancient traditions and Indian staples like the hard-to-dissuade matchmaker mother are mashed hard up against such newly evolving traditions and practices as Business Process Outsourcing ('BPO'), PhD dissertations at East Coast universities, Excel spreadsheets, IPOs, MBAs, the advent of the American Born Confused Desi ('ABCDs'), Western-style feminism and the bi-continental software business. The result is a fascinating look at Bangalore today through the eyes of someone who has lived both sides of this day-to-day encounter of new vs. old."
5,Hall of Fame,"""Legendary voices"" and ""More legendary voices"" are excellent compilations (accompanied with two highly reccomended books by Nigel Douglas) of 78 rpm. recordings done 1911-1949.Althought this comes as sequel,there is nothing secondary about these artists,they simply didnt make it on volume one because of limited space (I guess it would make perfect double disc?).These compilations also serve as a reminder where todays classical singers came from,how post WW"" singing changed as compared to previous generations and perhaps also,how fleeting and disposable fame is - like some old family portraits,most of the people (except Callas and Ferrier) are not well known today and that is why we have to be grateful to ""Nimbus Prima Voce"" company to keep the tradition & carry the torch into new century.Personally,I found ""Prima Voce"" CDs always irresistible and so far have collected 14 of them,more on the way.Richard Tauber,John Mc Cormack and Beniamino Gigli are wonderful.Reccomended!"
4,"Great printer, but childish problems","Great quality, easy to use, great drivers, nice features, no payper jamming (had to study to work with rolls). only one problem, Cleaning heads on generic printing heads may be weekly, but heads so cheap, I wouldn't call it problem, just order pack of heads 3 times cheaper then others"
1,Stay Away from Epson Printers,"Cons: Poor paper handling with frequent jams. Ruins many photos with roller marks or wrinkles.VERY FREQUENT nozzle clogs. I am wasting 3/4 of every ink cartridge by having to go through several cleaning cycles daily.Nonexistent tech support, emails to tech support simply results in an automated reply that puppets back the same useless information on their website.Epson printers are simply not worth the hassle and expense for the one in ten photo that prints correctly."
2,Do You Love Buying Ink?,I stuck with Epson because I really liked my old reliable Stylus Color 400....but I have some issues with this printer!Yes - this printer can print a remarkable photo!But - as many have pointed out here - it requires consistent cleaning of the print heads.What does this mean? Well - two main issues:1 - You never know exactly when during the printing of pictures that your prints will suck.2 - Cleaning the print heads wastes ink - so you will be constantly buying more.Yes - there is a print pattern you can run to check to see if the heads need cleaning - but even if this checks out - you can still run into quality issues during an 8x10 print or the printing of many 4x6s.I wish I could recommend this printer - but due to this issue - I cannot. At the first sign of any major trouble - I am burying it and I guess will try another major manufacturer like HP.
5,Sexy Cute Bag,When I got this bag I thought it was kind of small but it turned out to be the perfect fit. The leather is so soft. It is very trendy. Also it goes well with any shoe but perfect with the Jessica Simpson cowboy boots(guys love them)
1,too high,now days you can't find a skip-it in stores but for $9.99 at K-Mart you can get what is called a Hopper. & it will last just as long as any skip-it for way less money.
4,Cannot beat basic principles,"I have not played competitive chess for over fifteen years now but have decided to get back into the game. I know how important the openings are because there is nothing worse than losing a game before you even start. I also know how boring it can be memorizing different sets of moves. This book teaches you the principle of the opening phase without you having to memorize. When you do start playing the established openings, you will be able to appreciate the underlying thought processes behind them. A must for anyone who wants to get through the opening phase without cramming."
2,Image Intrkera deep conditioner,"I have used this product for 20 years. I think they must of changed the formula and it is not as rich in color as it use to be. When you put some in the palm of your hand to rub it together before putting it in your hair, it feels soapy and not like it used to be.I tried to call the manufacturer but got no satisfaction. This will be the last bottle I purchase."
2,Pretty Much A Waste Of Time,"The value of this book is that the author can write like you dream about writing. But the story itself is improbable if not downright silly. I won't dignify it by a synopsis. The characters are also wanting. Very few novels succeed in having the hero/heroine witness a crime and then give it the old ""I won't go to the police because..."". It does not succeed here, either. It's very difficult to believe that the protagonist can be as stupid as he is in this story. Freedman ought to get someone to plot for him. Don't waste your time."
4,isokinetics magnetic pedal exerciser,"This is not for ""under your desk at work"" but it does a fine job if you are sitting on a kitchen chair. It does have a tendency to slide on any surface other than carpet so you might want to make a strap to go from the exerciser to the legs of your chair.I have it for about a month and am pleased. I pedal away while reading a magazine or book. Great for when you don't want to go outside in the winter."
3,well known book!,sent it to my sister! she already knew of this book. from her ex's lawyer! go figure. guess it was a well known book before I sent it to her. hopefully she's read it and also given it to her daughter whom I was initially worried about! so...she would have to really rate it for ya'll. guess everyone who is or is going to go through a divorce should get this book......just in case.
5,"Much praise for Dr. Warshak and his book, Divorce Poison","This book has been a bible to me and so many other parents who have been alienated from their beloved children. Honestly, I don't know what I would have done without it. Dr. Warshak makes sense out of something that was unthinkable. He has given me and so many others hope that perhaps some day the children we love so dearly will be back again in our lives. But just as important, he has given alienated parents the tools in which to deal with the suffering of the present, with a situation that is so incredibly painful and cruel. He gives us hope to move forward slowly, but surely, that perhaps we will be able to see thru the PAS haze and once again can look forward to actually having a future.Dr. Warshak is a true blessing."
5,Excellent read.,"I bought both this book and the one called FAMILY COURT HELL through amazon. If you read Divorce Poison first and FAMILY COURT HELL next, you actually see what harm is done to children where one parent tries to poison the childrens minds against the other parent. In FAMILY COURT HELL, a real life child access case that went on for ten years, the mother had spent all those years trying to turn her three little girls against their father. But eventually, the mother instead saw her daughters run away from her to be with the dad they still really loved and missed-the mother ended up losing out, and all through her own fault. Both books excellent reads and a must read for any parent whose ex is trying to turn the kids against them-or an ex thinking of trying to poison the kids minds!."
5,Great Book,Divorce Poison is a great book. I found so many gems of information which pertain to my situation. It was an excellent resource and definitely worth the buy!
1,This shredder barely lasted a year,Recommendation: Buy another shredder. This shredder barely lasted a year with minimal use. I think it was a piece of junk.
1,GEARS BREAK,"TERRIBLE SHREDDER, THE FIRST HAD A GEAR BREAK WITH LIGHT USE. THEY USE PLASTIC TEETH THAT BREAK WHEN SHEDDING JUST 3 PAGES AT A TIME. MANUFACTURER REPLACED FIRST ONE AFTER 3 MONTHS. THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED WITH THE SECOND ONE ALSO. VERY POORLY DESIGNED!!!!"
1,Bin Makes Handy Carrying Case for Broken Parts,"What could be safer than a shredder that runs only in reverse? What could be sneakier than hiding the last screw underneath a sticker, so you're likely to damage the product further when attempting to pry it apart to repair it? What could be more frugal than hideously inadequate plastic parts that give out when your bottle of rotary-blade oil is still virtually full? The P600C is a high-water mark for planned obsolescence, and planned obsolescence is a terrific way to boost profits so long as customers can't remember the name of the folks who ripped them off. So putting ""Fellowes"" right on the top of the blasted thing--yeah, not such a good idea."
2,"solid fridge, but beware of shipping","This refrigerator was a great deal, but it is shipped with almost no separation from the box and it arrived heavily damaged. I returned the fridge for a replacement assuming it was a fluke, but the replacement arrived with the same type of packaging and was also significantly damaged. Until Amazon or the third party supplier of the refrigerators uses another packaging method, I would NOT recommend buying this."
2,Poor Packaging,"The first item I received was highly dented. This is because the packaging is so inadequate for this type of item. Since it was to be used outside, I sucked it up, figuring it was was easier than returning the unit. Then the item dod not work, so i had to return it. The next refrigerator I received was damamged again, but much less than the first one...and it worked...so, i kept it. I read other complaints about the packaging of this item, but purchased anyway thinking it was over-stated...it's not. Sanyo really needs to work this out as I am sure 90% of the refrigerators that are sent out become dented if they are all packaged the way mine were. The fridge works fine...but does need frequent defrosting."
4,Sanyo Fridge,The fridge was delivered bruised and on crutches. Sanyo needs to redesign the shipment container for units that are being trucked to residential addresses. Amazon was very gracious about assisting me with this matter.
2,Refrigerator Review,The refrigerator runs fine. The only issue I have is that it came with a dent in it; the packing materials were all crumbled.
1,Biased book based on a sales pitch,"Before you purchase this book be aware that this is just another one of these money making, get rich quick schemes. Fabian does give some good advice, nevertheless, for building your investing knoweledge there are much better options out there. Fabian's book rests primarily on the use of his company's newsletter to get your information. His 39 week average can be found no where else on the web. If your trying to learn about money read Rich Dad, Poor Dad. If your trying to learn about mutual funds by a more unbiased book."
4,"Great writer, good plan, somewhat outdated.","Dick Fabian really cared about teaching people what he had learned from investing. Sadly, his son is money hungry and didn't keep up the free info that is referenced in the book on the website. I learned a lot about investing and some basic strategies to avoid major losses in the stock market. His theory isn't going to make you rich overnight, but hopefully it will raise your rate of return a couple of points over your lifetime, which could mean big bucks for some people. If you look closely, he says shoot for 20%, but he even points out that his picks over time only got him 14%. I will say one thing, if you would have used his plan, you would have been out of the market during the whole stock market crash in 2000-2002 and back in the thing in 2003. That alone makes this worth a read."
5,This book changed my financial life.,"Buy this book. Read it, all of it. Then implement the trend- following plan which the author recommends. Dick Fabian's plan is simple and profitable. You will make more money with about half the risk."
3,Disappointed,"I was excited to try this perfume after all I read about and I got a mini bottle of this, I don't know if that was the problem or what but it didn't smell that good and by the middle of the day I didn't smell it on me anymore.Anyone try the sample size of this and didnt like it but tried the regular bottle and it smelled better?"
4,Love at first sight,"I loved this book when I first read the review. I immediately purchased it and was not dissapointed. The characters were so alive and real. I envied Renee and Giovanni's ""love at first sight"" courtship and was heartbroken at the ""Romeo and Juliet"" consequences that surrounded them. I highly recommend this book. May Mr. Murray bring us a sequel soon!"
4,Hilarious and well written,"Traveling home from work during a blistering Virginia snowstorm, Renee encounters an intriguing entity just as white as the snow....Jay.Renee is a brazen around the way sister...confident and sassy, bossy and aloof. Jay is a soft spoken, naive, and all too willing to please Italian. What a combination! The eccentrics of these two characters collide, exploding into a hilarious romantic tale that is sure to entertain you.The bright, candid characters, humorous words, and speedy story line make this novel an enjoyable delight. Mr. Murray did his homework and plunges head first into the wispy and frank mind of a strong, sometimes difficult, black women. Although the throngs of courtship swarm throughout the story, Renee and Jay isn't void of trouble in paradise. The young couple encounters a string of problems and characters that will keep you wanting to read more."
2,"Sweet, but boring and predictable","This book was a nice idea. However, I found the book to be extremely dull and predictable.I mean come on, from the moment these two met, they were inseperable. They didn't seem to have any BIG problems. Nothing stood in their way to make the story interesting. Renee was on the rebound, and she just fell in love with the first man to show her a kindness. He could've been purple--she still would've fell in love.And come on, who hadn't figured out halfway through the book who Renee's mom's new man was. DUH! What was supposed to be a surprise twist, was just another predictable part of the story.For the white readers out there; please do NOT think that Renee is the typical black woman. All of us are not nasty, jealous, gutter mouth bullies who live w/Mama.All in all, I was pretty disappointed."
5,A rare gem of a 19th century mass.,"I was just a bit distressed to find only one recording of this work when I searched for the name of the mass and the name of the composer. This is a fine example of a composer's doing more with less. The liner notes indicate that the work was written to appeal to provincial tastes and be performable with a smaller than usual (certainly smaller ensemble than Bach or Mozart could call up) group of performers, so that his Catholic patrons would smile on his efforts.Like having the limits of rhyme and meter in poetry, these strictures seem to have produced a really remarkable work. If you have any interest at all in liturgical music, you need to track down a recording of this work!"
4,Mini Mag light flashlight,"Very nice that it came with the anti roll ring, pocket clip and colored lens. I also was able to send my broken ones back for warranty claim. Great company."
5,Tornado Tube,"The Tornado Tube is a fun and easy way to create everyone's favorite science experiment, the tornado in a soda bottle. I needed to do a demonstration of the experiment for a college course. The Tornado Tube was shipped quickly and worked wonderfully. If you are looking to create the tornado in a bottle experiment, this is the product for you."
4,Does what it says - but does leak a little,"There's not a whole lot to be said about the tornado tube. It screws onto any standard sized screwtop plastic bottle. We have used it with 2-Liter bottles as well as 20oz bottles. We have added colors to it (and now that we have some glitter on hand will probably do that as well).The only reason that I wouldn't give this a 5 star is because it DOES leak, both before and after prying the leftover plastic ring off the bottles and screwing it on as tightly as the threading on the bottle would allow. The leakage is minor, so we'll just continue to use this with a towel laid out under it.Any type of waterproof tape would likely fix this - but if I wanted to use tape, I would have just duct-taped the bottles together rather than purchasing this tube for the purpose - as part of the appeal was being able to easily put the bottles together and take them apart."
3,Wagner Ceramics,"This was my first purchase with ceramic brakes so I expected they were just simply direct replacements. But after installing them and using them for a few weeks I as amazed that they are not as quiet as I expected. Perhaps if had resurfaced the rotors I would have had better results. Now don't get me wrong the pads work great, they are just noisy. I haven't used them enough to see if they are low dust but time will tell. The longer I use them the less noise they make so I am guessing they take awhile to get fully seated. I will give them a try and may even purchase them again but I will install new rotors at the same time."
5,Excellent book and service,"Very pleased with book and speed of delivery.Book is very easy reading and informational as well.Gives you a little insight as to a mules logic and mode of thought, guess I'll know soon enough!!!!"
2,"Interesting read, nothing more","Another one of those rosy-picture books about baking. The truth is that it is a hard business to get into and even harded to survive in it. It makes for good reading, though."
3,Too much repetition,"Not sure if this is another case of a publisher requiring an author to write a certain number of pages, when the author doesn't have the content to fill those pages, but I grew weary of the repetition in the book. Basically, if you read the reviews here ([...]), you won't need to spend time reading the book. The relevant content could've, and in my opinion should've, been condensed into a pamphlet."
4,not a bad cd,"I have gotten a few gems off this small stone records and this is another the first half has a kiss meats a good southern rock band to it the second song shoot the moon and the last 4 or 5 songs the sinner sounds like leeny of motherhead and the music like a good hard southern rock band .The standouts are shooth the moon ,gunfight , brideges, and getaway. The production is not that good in a few songs but i am telling you these guys are good .If you are looking for something different try this cd i am sure itwont let you down. I hope this review was helpfull to you"
1,What garbage!,"In deference to my longstanding crush on Patrick Stewart, my husband gave this to me as a joke, and a joke it is! If I were to gather up a pile of fanzines, tabloids and talk show video clips, I could have written this book (although I hope I would have proofread it a little better. The typos are legion.) The ""authors"" did nothing except cut and paste previously published material -- no additional research or interviews went into producing it. Faithfully repeating what Mr. Stewart said to Jay Leno is about as insightful as it gets. All my Amazon pals who gave this 5 stars might want to try reading a real biography some time!"
2,Fictional characters didnt work for me,"Fictional characters didnt work for me. I wanted to hear some real stories. I just couldnt get that worked up by a fictional story of death. I think it would make a great book if the stories were non-fiction. Like ""Into Thin Air"" but a dozen short stories."
4,Reality is not just out there,"This book, first published in 1990, is still valuable for appreciating the philosophical basis of modeling and our construction of reality. Change involves changing our models. The key concepts of the early Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), with the emphasis on relationship, the use of language, especially the meta model, the use of various types of reframing are all illustrated with specific examples, transcripts and stories. The book is easy to read and one gets a good understanding of the foundations of NLP and its applications to therapy. Given this introduction, one can move on to O'Connor and Seymour's Introducing NLP and subsequently methodically study Robert Dilts' more recent writings in Modeling with NLP and Sleight of Mouth."
4,A delightful bedtime story,"Our 2.5 year old adores this and other books by Jez Alborough. ""It's the Bear"" has lovely rhyming language, great illustrations and is a sure winner at bedtime.The story itself provides opportunities for little ones to participate in punch lines and share their thoughts on what is going on in the pictures."
3,Alright well..,"I was a little confused on how to perceive this guy when I first heard him. Apparently this cat is Ivy league educated, he's done tracks with MF Doom(and we all love MF DOOM), and he's got Prince Paul backing him. The content of this cd is pretty amusing and funny although I'm sure more than a few heads are gonna turn this away when they hear his voice. Seriously, when I first heard him spit a few years back, I thought it was a joke, even though I think he intended for his style to come off in a jokingly manner. I'll say this, I definitely think his style grows on you after a few spins. I would just recommend you take a listen to a few tracks before you make a purchase. I gave it a 3, but I think a 3.5 would be a more deserving score. I feel like the reviews on this cd need to more balanced because it is not a perfect cd as many are claiming to be. It is a breath of fresh air, but not a classic."
5,OhMyGod,"That'z phat! That'z too damn funny,,I THINK IT'Z TIME WE SEE MC PAUL BARMAN vs. EMINEM in a freestyle! Too too funny,,,,,"
4,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT..,"aight..well, i copped this album in vinyl a while back..and it was dope, but it ain't the illest album out now..it ain't the weirdest album out now..and you sure don't need a dictionary to listen to it, unless you're illiterate..the album's nice..paul barnum is dope..he ain't the ""nicest"", but he's dope..if you've heard quas(mad lib)'s new album, or of course del's, or basically if you're a ""true head""(haha) then you've already heard of have this paul barman album so you don't even need to read these pointless reviews..."
3,"tasty, but undercooked","The flavor of these lentils was good, but unfortunately they were very undercooked. I would not have bought this pack of 12 had I ever been able to try them beforehand. However, since I have them, I'm making the best by adding water and simmering for another 45 minutes. They are still good, but because of this they are no longer portable."
2,Dumbing down Satie,"Satie's Gymnopedies are beautiful and expressive works -- that have a distinctive sound. This interpretation dilutes Satie with ""soft jazz"" that is oh-so-familiar -- and not very interesting."
5,Fellowes shredder oil,What can I say lubricating oil for shredders. It does have a long spout for ease of reaching hard to get to places.
5,You need to oil you shredded,This product was a much better price than at office supply stores. Most people do not do it because of the cost and effort. It is easy to use and so far no spills. It will significantly extend the life of your shredder.
1,Sales Insurer,"I bought a Fellows shredder a few years back and have returned to buy another. The reason is because of the Fellows oil. The shredder was great but the oil gums up over time eventually ruining the unit. It will take 5 or 6 years but the oil will kill the shredder for sure! So I intend, with the new shredder, to obtain some non-gumming lube at the hardware store. Not going to make the same mistake. No star!"
2,Its only vegetable oil!,While this product does the job you can save yourself some money and buy vegetable oil at the market. This is why I give it only 2 stars.
4,How to make your shredder last,Buy it. Use it. Don't use canola oil like others tell you to. Your shredder is not a salad. Applying oil regularly is the only way to keep your shredder alive and shredding.......
5,Works great,Good shredder oil - glad I bought this. It's wise to have extra shredder oil on hand for one's expensive shredder. This oil does the job well and is a good quantity (the tiny bottle that comes with most shredders is not enough for long-term use). This bottle of shredder oil is bigger than the tiny trial-size oil given with many shredders. I'd recommend it to others.
4,It does what it's suppose to... lubricate.,"I originally purchased this for a shredder, but it has become a household lubrication oil for older tripods, tools, etc. It's a little messy and sticky so keep hold of the cap."
4,Makes things run smoothly,"Didn't know I needed to lubricate the shredder and had not done so in the past on my previous machine. This item was suggested when I was viewing shredders on line. Makes a difference. Happy I bought it, just wish the nozzle was longer. I thought it would be. It would make it easier to direct oil to the right place."
3,without instructions...,"I think this is a good product but I really don't know as it does not come with instructions. I don't know if I'm using it correctly or not. Here's hoping!Seriously, though, it could have benefited from the slightest bit of documentation attached. They could have made it a fold-out page attached to the label and that page could have been used as a sample, if, in fact, you're supposed to use a page when using this oil. Otherwise, I guess all that is not necessary, but put SOMETHING as far as recommended use/instructions somewhere in/on the package."
1,this is just 99% canola oil,[...]I read this in a review and sure enough this oil is canola oil. Expensive canola oil and probably not deodorized like cooking canola oil. But it is Canola oil. This oil has gummed up my shredder and now the lever that should pop up after paper goes thru is stuck in the down position and so the shredder does not automatically turn off.
4,O'Reilly in Palatable Doses,"I am a nightly viewer of O'Reilly's The Factor newsmag, but though I share many of his views (and often his outrage), I find that his manner is often too grating for the end of my day. The format of this book, however, was perfect for me. It is arranged in short, and for the most part self-contained vignettes that I read on my morning and evening commutes. I found that I like O'Reilly best in these small doses, and highly reccommend the book to both his avid fans and more lukewarm viewers alike."
4,No Big Surprises at this Point,"Good, informative book, just as I would expect from O'Reilly. He's honest and to the point. The book is basically him rehashing what transpired during some of his ""No Spin Zone"" interviews on his show. Interesting stuff about his past with Dan Rather. A good read."
1,Shameless Promotion,"O'Reilly can suck it, Maddox is awesome, shameless promotion: http://www.purevolume.com/WeatherfordandtheNWJ"
1,Luxury Bird Cage Lining,"This book would probably have been better had it not been ""written"" by one of the great morons in America today.Few individuals epitomize the frothing-at-the-mouth, rabid stupidity of the Neo-con sheeple as thoroughly as Bill O'Reilly. What he lacks in intelligence and insight he more than makes up for with vitriol and volume. Unfortunately, in the written form, you can't actually hear him scream over you, so the whole delivery sort of loses its punch.You could spend your money on this book...but why would you? If you're a neo-con who wants a good read, try the Bible. Neo-cons love to talk about the Bible, but few have ever read it.If you're a liberal or moderate who just wants a good laugh or a glimpse into the disjointed world of mental illness, any of Oliver Sacks' books would make a far better read.In short, what wouldn't make a better read? Save this one until AFTER you've read every other book in your library."
4,Under fire for speaking his mind,"Love him or hate him, Mr. O'Reilly's book fills a void. That, in and of itself, makes it noteworthy. This book points out some of the inequities in the American political and social landscape. His is an interesting and different ""voice"" in the world of the print and broadcast media. Although I do not always agree with the ideas presented in this book, it is an excellent read and I recommend it. James Green, author of ""If There's One Thing I've Learned."""
2,"Rehashed Segments from Show, Disappointing","I enjoy Bill O'Reilly's candor and passion and often catch his program on Fox News. His latest book is populated with short excerpted (transcribed) segments from his show and is divided topically. Not only had I already seen the majoriy of the interviews when they originally aired, but O'Reilly's brief commentary, introducing and concluding each chapter, also lacked freshness. It is no doubt difficult for such a strong personality to continue to produce new material given his high exposure level, and there may be a market for a summary of his views. I had hoped for more."
1,God hates this book!,"God cries whenever he hears the name O'Reilly. It makes him sad to see that one of His creations is such a boorish moron. This book made God give the silent treatment to everyone for 10000 years! In fact, God hated this book so much that he sent fires from the heavens down unto the publishing houses that printed this book and sent plagues upon the homes of O'Reilly supporters!"
1,Why don't they have a zero star rating??,"After reading the first two pages of this book, I've decided to burn it. Damn, Maddox was right. This guy is a concited moron, plus the fact that he loves Bush. Make it go away."
1,Sucks to be you,"I find this book to be the best joke book i had ever read, i guess you're in the ""stuppiest americans top 100"", more like you're the number one. Quite a waste of paper!!You book doesn't make sense."
1,how many coffees do you need to stay awake while reading?,"I commute 2 hours a day and I like to read a good book with opinionated views. This seemed like the perfect book but after a while I realized i was reading it just not to stop half way (i like to finish what i start). This book started to really lose my attention and interest with its criticism of certain music types as hip hop (altho im not a fan) and their influences. Later on if anyone disagrees then theyre ""unpatiotic"". Geee thanks for that conclusion... So what did I get from this book... a couple of raised eye brows and a nice constipation from all the coffee i drank to stay awake while reading... umm no, not really!"
1,still a blowhard- now in hardcover!,"Whoa. Nobody will ever call Bill O'Reilly self- depricating. Fair and balanced? Instead, it became the longest mind-dump ever scribed to paper. Avoid this one."
1,O' Reilly you blow ass,"MADDOX = GODReviewer: Alex Coffin from Chico, CABill O'Reilly has the most annoying, droning voice. He gets pissed over anything, and his ""Fair and Balanced"" oppinions are completely biased. Maddox is god, just know that. Jesus? Dude, forget about Jesus and throw your bible away. your one true Lord is at http://maddox.xmission.com O'Reilly can go blow himself. Pirates are awesome. This book made me wanna vomit on it then burn it, piss on the ashes, and write a run-on sentence about how much I hate those ashes and wish I could throw them at Bill O' Reilly causing blindness. ***Maddox = God***"
2,Heard it Before,"If you're a regular viewer of his TV show, The O'reilly Factor, you have already read the book! The chapter on the fantasy Hillary interview is funny. The rest of the book is Bill's rehash of how all the interviews (when the ""NO Spin"" took place on his show) is rather boring to a regular viewer. However, if you have never seen his shows, you'll find the book very entertaining."
5,Wake up America!,"I have to advise reading this book to everyone I know. Bill O'Reilly tells the truth! And that is sooo rare in this time of world where we are covered in lies.This book tells you the truth and is based on the FACTS!I found this book eye-opening and funny.In the end, you will have to decide for yourself but I dont think you would be dissapointed in buying this book."
1,Not a book review just a statement,"I guess I am just one of the ""sheep"" as one of the previous reviews stated. I have read and agreed with almost all the articles on http://maddox.xmission.com/ He writes great articles, they are amusing, and some just down right true. But, I pose a question to you all....If you do not like the works of Maddox, why do you continually go to that website and read??"
1,Just oh so sad...,"This book sux donkey balls. If I wanted to read a book full of assumptions, I'd read the Bible. Check out http://maddox.xmission.com for more info. And to think that O'Reilly was born in the U.S....let alone in the 20th century."
1,Bill''s AssKissZone,"Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a ""loofa"" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from WashingtonJeff Gannon"
1,Horrible,This book is the worst thing i have read in my entire life! After reading a few pages i coulden't torture myself any longer and I threw it away. http://maddox.xmission.com
2,nothing of substance,"Since O'Reilly is the Gas Bag-in-Chief at Faux News, I expected more from him than a book that takes no more than 90 mins. to finish. There's no depth, intellect, or wit here. I give it 2 stars only because of the catchy title that [attracts] you into buying it."
3,"I changed my mind, they rock!","Initially I had given this 3 stars. Repeated listening confirmed what I suspected...they sound better than Jefferson Airplane but they ""don't have the hits"". They're pretty good, I think their horrible name probably did more damage than anything else, other than not having a hit single. Sit back and enjoy the ride, it will satisfy a lot of ""What ifs?"". Mine has always been, what if there was a group that had great harmony AND good music behind it?...well there was, and the conspiracy is spreading."
2,Peanut Butter Conspiracy - ' Is Spreading / Great Conspiracy' (Collectables),"Sorry to say that I was a bit let down with this two-on-one album CD reissue.Nice value for the money,though.I consider this Los Angeles band to be third rate psychedelia.Problem is out of a total of 25 songs,the good tunes are simply too few and far between.For example,three cuts that I thought were good include ""It's A Happening Thing"",""Why Did I Get So High?"" and ""Turn On A Friend"".Other than that,this release doesn't really do much for me.The band apparently put out three lp's between 1966-69 and then called it a day.The CD's final cut,an unreleased tune ""Peter Pan"" is the lamest thing I believe I've ever heard.Might appeal to some fans of Music Emporium,H.P.Lovecraft,Moby Grape and Jefferson Airplane.Do keep in mind those acts,of course are SO much better,it isn't even funny.Recommended ONLY for fans they had back when they were together and perhaps open-minded collectors."
5,Scout's review,"Scout (a Jack Russell Terror)and I love this book. There is a large variety of dog breeds, and the captions fit the dogs' expressions. This book makes a great gift for a dog lover, or a dog's human companion; plus is a nice ""coffee table"" book."
5,Inspirational,"This is another book review from the boonie dogs, Wolfie and Kansas. ""If Only You Knew How Much I Smell You"", by Valerie Shaff and, allegedly, Roy Blount, Jr., is an inspiring collection of dog photographs. Both the pictures and the captions are wonderful. Our only complaint is that Blount, a noncanine animal of primate derivation, takes credit for many captions that were obviously written by the dogs themselves."
4,Excellent Training Manual,This really is a training manual covering all the basics. From stance to punches and kicks this book has a good format. If you're new to JKD or come from a traditional martial art this is a good start (some friends who box liked the punching section). Overall a good book to help you develop a training routine. There is nothing on Iron Palm so disregard the other review.
2,This is not the presentation I was looking for,"The bottle is not as shown on the picture, however the product content is OK> The tube is far from being practic or effective. Instead of drops out of a bottle you get a rub with some sort of sponge that itches more than the bite before getting the desire relief. Please CHANGE THE PICTURE or the product description."
3,AN UNFORTUNATE SYMPHONIC BEGINNING,"How I wish Gorecki had not fallen under the malignant influence of the Serial School, which is noise pretending to be music (just as Abstract Impressionism is psychopathy pretending to be painting). NO, I definitely DO NOT like his First Symphony, particularly in light of what he was able to produce later. But, the Three Pieces in the Old Style (the name is quite significant here) preview a return to the grandeur of melody. So I skip to them! But I think every Gorecki fan ought to have an example of his early Boulez noise style. Thank God he found his roots!"
3,hmmm,"Well, I like the looks of these shoes. I thought they were very comfortable until I decided to go on a power walk in them. My feet were soooo sore! I guess my recommendation is that these are good for knocking around in but not for power walks or hikes!"
3,"No intrigue, but a straight telling of facts.","First off, the name of the book is misleading. There is no real riddle here. He just explains the origins of the compass, and the slight mystery of whom invented it. Nothing much else about it.He starts off with a bit of history, starting with what was done before the compass was invented. Then he describes how the simple magnet in water was discovered, and how it evolved it what it is today. He goes into the ancient Chinese origins, then the Italian invention and refinement, and then to the Portuguese navigators.Though not a gripping tale, it's basically an interesting history lesson."
2,The author is no Simon Winchester,Given the credentials of the author I was disappointed in the lack of detail and scholarship presented in the book. I should have read the other reviews!
3,roaster,"ITs okay but not as large as I thought it would be. I do like the inset with the handles, so it was worth it."
4,"a great variety of recipes, and exotic dishes","all of the recipes in this book look wonderful, there are plenty of beautiful pictures to accompany this book. most of the recipes are fairly simple and quick to prepare. the only downfall is that many of the recipes require special ingredients that you might not find at your local grocery store. if this is not a problem for you, then you will enjoy the book. the ideas are great and there is a lot of variety, recipes for all kinds of meats, vegetables and some sea food. it also includes descriptions of ingredients, if you're new to asian foods!"
3,"caution, do not feed the animals","Chilling book about chilling N. GA trailer animals. Very representative of the natives and the culture. The people down there are capable of anything, and this book is a good tour of their psyche."
3,Trial of PE3,"For the gentleman who post the review below about not getting a trial version of the software with the book, others who are wishing to try it out do not need to look elsewhere if their copy does not come with a trial version. One can simply go to adobe's website and download any of their products for a 30 day trial period! - I personally do not own these book, I own two of Scott Kelby's books, I highly recommend those and purchasing PE3.0 it is a very powerful consumer-level digital photo editing tool and much more!***** I had to rate this item to post this message, Please disregaurd my rating as I have not read this book Thank you.*****"
1,"DON'T ""TRY"" THIS GAME!","This game ""is bad""! You have to be a submarine captain to figure it out. I thought it would be cool, but it's not at all. Please don't get it. Just a warning."
3,the leather quality is not consistance with Birkenston brand,"the leather quality is not consistance with Birkenston brand, pay good price but I don't think there is a chance I will dress them out."
2,Decent video - but overpriced,"I purchased both the Intermediate and Beginner tape from Hilary Thacker. Both are *ok*, but not worth the price. If they go on sale for 50% off it would be a good buy. The video quality is decent and the backdrops are not distracting. She is not very good at explaining moves and positioning. My friend who was a beginner did not like the video at all. I was able to get more out of it because I already knew what she was talking about."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Purchased this item base on others reviews...Big mistake..it's a piece of junk.
4,"Decent memory card, great price","This is probably one of the most available brands on the market, and one of the best values. It is now working well in my digital picture frame and camera. I did have some initial problems with formating, but after a little time i was able to access the full card. I am now pleased with it. It's just basic SD, a bit slower than some of the upper SD cards (Lexar professional, Sandisk newest generation), but heck, I got this for $25 and I'm using it a picture frame, not to shabby. It also works in my camera if needed. Check it out, good basic card."
2,Lame,This documentry style DVD is quite boring and cheesy. The interviews that Avril is in are all taken from other media. It kind of seemed like her uncle made this video to make some money off of her fame.
4,Olde 1904,"Throw away your disposibles, and step into flavour country. Well constructed, good looking, and great price, my only complaint is how the blade is removed/changed on this beauty, it is a bit cumbersome as you have to take the unit apart. I plan on buying a Merkur that has the knob that opena and closes the razor, and putting this model in my ""away"" dopp kit."
2,Why pay for an overlong advert?,"The book is interesting as a portrayal of the guy and the great work he does but lets be honest it is just one long advertorial. I also have my questions over the artist's choice of female, a rather young nubile woman, to accompany the glorifying images of Mr Barnes."
1,Wrong spiritual path,"Some very good and interesting ""getting in touch with body and mind"" destressors but in conflict with Christian sprituatlity."
3,'Bald'-Faced Parody,"Last summer's suprise indie hit about three whiners lost in the woods was ripe for parody, and Campbell filmmaker Shawn Flanagan was ready to pounce with his own 'Bald Witch Project.''CAN YOU HOLD the camera steady? Just hold the camera steady,"" says Hank, one of the unfortunates in The Bald Witch Project, played by Campbell filmmaker Shawn Flanagan. The story is simplicity itself and completely 100 percent original."
5,"Great, but short read","This book is another good Jayne Castle, or Anne or whatever she's calling herself now read. It's a great little book to pick up and read on the beach, but don't plan to sun long it's super short."
2,Works good; doesn't hold up,"The dual rollers are a good idea and it works good, but its made of plastic with only the rollers having any metal. The first time I used it the rollers fell out of the plastic head! I used Emjoi Opti-mini dual roller epilator, with the same results--its plastic, it lasts about a year, then the plastic parts quit. The plastic gears need to be replaced with metal, then it might be a great product.Its an epilator, so it does pull the hair out by the roots and, yes, it hurts a little--what do people expect while having hair pulled out by the roots."
1,girlfriend hated it,"Spent $80 on this expensive strong cologne, girlfriend hated it. Now its just a decoration. Make sure your women like it first otherwise you are burning your money."
3,TOO LIGHT,"This cologne smells good and is very light; unfortunately it doesn't seem to last too long. I like it but will not purchase it again. I prefer, by far, Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L'Homme Yves Saint Laurent Eau De Toilette Spray. This is awesome!"
5,Very happy!,I am very happy with this purchase. Great deal and serves it's purpose. Very easy to install and small enough to store easily when not in use. Highly recommend!
1,More info please. Email address for questions or 800#,"I bought the book, ""the magick of chant-o-matics.""I have questions about some of the chants. Ex. (1)Some of the rituals does'nt indicate what incense to use. (2)Can you say the chant over again, if it says ""chant for ten minutes' on a Friday? (3) I can not find saffron incense anywhere,have looked every where.(4) Do you use a white candle with every ritual? (5) How do you pronounce some of the rituals. Please answer, so I can try out the rituals, and hopefully give a better rating."
4,Liked this book.,"I am enjoying this book. Helps put mind in the right place for manifesting. Facilitates alignment between your thoughts and desires. Am using it off and on right now a few times. Nothing yet, but I can feel myself changing positively - for the better. With that alone, I am sure that good things will manifest!"
3,Too much legal information,"I enjoyed the book near the end, the beginning was boring, little dialogue and there was tooooooooo much information on legal procedures. The end of the book was much better, the story finally started to develop, the problem is it took forever."
2,What am I missing?,"Based on this book, I don't think I'll be reading any others by this author.Am I the only one who can't get past the writer's lack of technical skill as a writer?The story is OK so far (I'm only about half way through), but come on,cliché after cliché, silly 'romantic' relationship scenes, sophomoric writing style and ability,endless lessons on legal procedure...If her name wasn't Burke, she'd have a tough time getting published.I am disappointed in some of the endorsements on the cover. I doubt that some of thesewriters actually read the book before they gave a nod."
2,Written below you perhaps to encourage you?,"This short little pamphlet with big font is a quick read. The author tries to use a humorous drill instructor approach to what-to-do and what not-to-do when expecting. The book could be more accurately re-titled ""how not to make your pregnant wife angry,"" since it's really more about her than a survival guide for dads.The author's attempt at military humor, while recognized, doesn't improve the book. Some of the abbreviations used throughout the text (NFU, FFP, Etc.) make it a more confusing read. I appreciate a real dad sharing his take on things, but I think the topic might be better served with a more organized approach."
2,"Decent content, but read an excerpt if you can.","This is dude-to-dude advice. It has a ""you got your lady knocked up / say goodbye to Monday night football"" kind of tone. I suppose in retrospect, it could be expected with the ""Man-to-Man Advice"" in the title.I did't need to be reaffirmed of my ""dudeness,"" I just wanted to read up on some tips to be the best dad I can be. The content may have been there, but I couldn't get past the cartoon of a tone of the writer.If you're a dude freaking out over being a dad, this could be a good book for you.If you're a man who wants to get some facts a dad-to-be should know without cutesy quips, check out ""The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips, and Advice for Dads-to-Be"""
2,I know this guy has good intentions,"I recently bought this book and another book (the special edition of Keeping the Baby Alive till Your Wife Gets Home) for my husband. First of all, this book is very, very slim. But that's not why my husband didn't like it. He didn't care for the extremely simplistic writing and military tone. He also disliked the little clip art pictures which depict everyone as 1940s cartoon characters. Most of all, he got tired of the ""buddy-buddy"" advice and all of the pseudo-military acronyms that go with it. His final comment was, GIA this book, honey. (Give It Away)"
4,"beautiful, modern styling","I bought this stand knowing that eventually I would get a widescreen TV. It currently houses a 27"" standard tube set, but that leaves me room for some books on one end and my PlayStation 2 on the other. The center area has one adjustable shelf with enough room for a large Sony receiver, TiVo, DVD recorder and a DVD-changer. Behind each door is another shelf, suitable for DVDs or PS2 games and accessories.<br />I don't know if I would put a 34"" widescreen tube TV on this unit though. The top shelf needs to be thicker to support that much weight. It would be no problem for an LCD set, though."
4,correction,"I want to correct the record here -- ""lazy reviewer""'s review must refer to a different book, as ""Walking Dead"" does not have a heroine who is a feminist, but rather a male main character who is a scientist/researcher. It takes place on an imaginery caribbean island and involves moral dilemmas and adventure more than mystery. Well-written, with intriguing circumstances."
1,Returned,"I returned the product.. The photo online wasen't the best representation of the product. The thought it was a silkey material, but it almost felt like rubber. I fell in love with the photo, but when I received them I wasn't happy."
5,Great product for the pricde,"I really like Rada Cutlery. The knives stay sharp and are easy to use. Because they are so thin, you wouldn't want to use them cutting winter squash, but they are too small for that job anyway. They are amazingly good for the price."
5,Very Informative,I have really been enjoying reading about how to use Bach Flowers with woman. I have already used and been successful with several of the ideas.
1,IT SUCKS,I received mine as a gift. In one word SUCKS. Save your money or if you feel like wasting money give it to a charity. This DVD is just some company trying to get your money using Bon Jovi to do it. Don't let them. This DVD is not even worth 1 star.
1,Buyer beware....,A release was put out by the Band that this DVD is a piece of sh**! Don't waste your money.
1,Where's the 3 CDs ??,"The picture on the album cover says""Album No:1 In A Box Of 3"".So if there is only one CD....is this a bootleg CD ??The orginal CD was released as a 3 CD set...Can not find where or when this one CD diskversion was or could of been released..."
5,Thincom modem,"This modem is very easy to setup and to use. Within minutes, I was able to establish a connection to my server at work and with my Internet provider. It is much more convenient to download my email with my Visor than with my laptop. Potential buyers should be aware that the Multimail software (the email client)included with the modem is a trial version; you must purchase the software at the Actual Software home page. Other than this (which is not stated anywhere) the modem is well worth the price."
5,"Easy-to-prepare, tasty, fun, and nutritionally sound","50 Ways To Take The Junk Out Of Junk Food by nutrition expert Julie Whittingham is a straightforward and elegantly simple collection of recipes for helping the family eat healthier.

3,Gasland,Good informational documentary; not all necessarily factual. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qrstuvwxyz.
5,A classic,"Gasland is a must see; if you value the quality of your lifeand your children's well being, than check out this eye-opener.A winner of numerous awards for documentary, it precipitated mywriting to my congressman. By the way, have a glass of tap waternear you when you watch the film; than see if you can drink it afterthe documentary is over."
3,Closed Captioning for this documentary?,Not a review because I haven't watched it yet (so my 3 stars was a bit of a fib) because I can't find out if it has Closed Captioning. I'm hearing impaired and can only watch movies at home that have CC.Does anyone know? (Netflix and Amazon don't say it's CC but I've had other movies from them that neglected to say it was CC and actually were)I hope this 'review' isn't deleted by Amazon because it's a real dilemma for people who are hearing impaired.Thank you if you can tell me and if it does have CC then I'll come back and review it.
1,Liberal Farce,"If you want the truth, watch ""FrackNation"". Methane in well water has been documented for years and years. Seek the truth."
1,"Propaganda, not science.","The ""flaming water tap trick"", for which this movie is most well known, has been around for a long time. It probably predates the idea of shale gas drilling by 50 years at least.Of course, you'd never learn it from this movie. Mr. Fox presents it as some strange and new form of pollution.This isn't the only piece of deceptive propaganda in this film, just the most prominent."
1,What a crock,"Asinine, poorly researched, riddled with inaccuracies - and biased.In a time when we need accurate, factual documentaries - this is little more than scaremongering.And it has been pounced upon by irresponsible elements of the green lobby worldwide.Thankfully... anyone with access to the web can quickly learn the truth for themselves."
5,GasLand is worth watching!!,"This baby should have won the Academy Award for documentaries! Not only is the information vital and urgent for Americans, it is presented in a logical and entertaining manner."
1,Totally misleading and lacking in science,"This movie, GasLand, is filled with half truths and full blown lies. The director even readily admits it on film in the counter film ""TruthLand"" which features actual experts in the field commenting on the safety of fracking and the lengths natural gas drillers are going to be safe.You can watch the movie that tells the real story of a great resource boom that's creating jobs and not harming the environment here:[...]I have no affiliation with the movie, but knowing towns in places like Western Pennsylvania that were poor and suffering from massive unemployment and now have some of the lowest unemployment in the country because of opportunities created by fracking for natural gas, I wanted to make sure the other side is shown."
2,Disorganized,I returned this item and purchased Rand McNally 2003 Road Atlas. A much better choice. The Michelin offering is very disorganized and not user-friendly. I would not recommend it.
3,The speaker stands are fine...,These speaker stands are fine. The problem is the description on the site. The description says that these stands are perfect for home theater speakers. I have home theater speakers and these stands are not perfect for them at all. These speakers are for large-ish speakers - i.e. at least 5 inches wide. Wish it had said that somewhere. Now I've got my speakers sticking to the stands with velcro and hoping for the best.This model is RC1 - it doesn't say that in the description. The paperwork I got with the speakers says to get model RB1 instead for small home theatre speakers. Wish the description had had that too.
5,"A fun, creepy noir homage.","Venice, California, 1947. The boardwalk is slowly dying, the rollercoaster's on its last legs, and the oil wells pump sightlessly away just outside of town. On a trolley car racketing home one stormy night, a young man who dreams of writing science fiction gets a chilling message in his ear from an unseen man behind him... and soon, it seems that Death itself walks the streets of Venice, robbing the town of all the people who gave it its life and soul. Can a chubby would-be writer, a detective with a jungle in his backyard, and the world's greatest blind man beat Death at its own game? An immensely fun and beautifully written tribute to Raymond Chandler, based in good part on the author's own life. Fans of old Hollywood will want to check out the sequel, ""A Graveyard For Lunatics."""
2,Way too brief,Covers a number of topics in one or two paragraph bites. Doesn't really go over many useful concepts. Reads like a promotional flier for something that would offer more in-depth work. Can't really recommend this even as a refresher.
3,"""okay"" ... but","Video's of any kind are rather difficult to rate because of individual taste, and this is just our opinion.The group did not find it as enjoyable as hoped.I purchased 40's, 50's and 60's, and did not feel it was a $15 well spent."
3,Not a Factory Manual,"This is the very basic manual that I expected. It's OK for the price, but it lacks detail, and the illustrations are difficult to read. And, I found the description variations to accommodate the many GM models annoying."
5,You'll be suprised,"This diet is very workable and effective. It is NOT dangerous as some people think. In fact, my doctor, after viewing the results of many of her patients who have tried this diet, has become very supportive. It takes willpower and a willingness to stick to it. I have lost lots of weight and the best news of all is that my blood lipids are the best they have been in my entire life. Cholesterol, triglycerides, LDLs are at an alltime low. We do periodic liver testing along with a lipid profile and the levels remain normal after many months. My glucose levels are also excellent. It takes some work but it becomes second nature after awhile because you feel great and have tons of energy. You must adhere to the 8 cups of water a day and it's very important to have some form of exercise program going. My wife and I both use this low carb diet and we both find it very satisfying."
1,I'm don't like this book at all,"I don't like this book. It explains elementary things about agents, in totaly non-scientific way.Very blah-blah style of writing."
5,So Satisfying,"When you want to read a book that fills your heart, feeds your mind, and lingers in your thoughts, chose this book. The characters are fully dimensional and the plot sustains itself completely. A joy to read."
3,different from my normal reading,"This is not a book I would normally pick up. I like to read more light and fun books. Life it too heavy to spend my fun time dwelling on unpleasant subjects. That being said I really enjoyed this book. Parts of the book make you laugh out loud and others make you cry. The characters are well developed and real. The book is crafted in such a way that I quickly got lost in the story and was deeply moved by all the emotion the book possessed. The book's messages of love, forgiveness, and healing are truly touching."
5,I seldom read a book twice...but this one I did.,"Life is tuff, especially when the behavior of some of the adults in your life stinks. Thank goodness there are some of those adults that will love you past the stink. O but the healing work is still so very tough. ""Wrapped"" gives voice to the gift and work of healing, this time for a man. Thank goodness for the good people in life that help in that process. Great book."
5,Awesome book!!,"Our local library offered this book on CD, and since I drive 4x a week 1 hr. 15 min. one way, I thought I'd give this book a try. I was a bit hesitant at first because of of the description of the book, but once I started to listen to it, I could not stop. I would sit in the parking lot at my school and wait until the last minute before turning off my car, or I'd sit in our garage for the longest time because I just couldn't turn the car off. I LOVED this book so much!! I even talked my husband into listening to it. (He's on the road a lot). He also enjoyed it a lot. I would recomment this book to anyone. I LOVED IT!!!!!"
5,Rain,Wrapped in Rain by Charles Martin is the story of Tucker Mason. A man famously known for capturing unseen things with his lens. Unfortunately he needs to see things in his life in a new way and forgive those that have wronged him. The question is can he do that. Can he forgive? Whether it was good or bad certain events take place forcing Mason to return to the one place and time he has avoided all of his adult life.Mason did have one special soul to help him and raise him but Miss Ella has died leaving him with only her words and prayers to guide him. Will this be enough for Mason to find peace and forgiveness? Well it will and does. This is an amazing story of a lifes journey from bad to good. Beautifully written to the point of distraction. This is a must read.
1,Drier than a Desert,"Have insomnia? Buy this book. It's awful, and very slow to read. It was a necessary purchase for a college course I was taking, and I lamented reading this book."
2,Not the best effort,Solid airplane read...but there are just too many unbelieable situations here to take credibly. There are better books in this series.
4,Trying too Hard?,"OK I like Jack Reached. He fights the bad guys and wins. But how many times must he be recaptured, makes an error, misjudge someone, or be confused to make the book last long enough to satisfy the publisher ? And how far can the author go with a conspiracy nut megalomaniac fat blonde Hitler toward a character whom we all want to see Reached kill. I can't wait to read the next one to answer my questions."
4,Die Trying,Fast paced; continues the story line. Enjoyable read. Reacher is a believable character and his abilities seem to coincide with his history.
2,All good sense overboard!,"This book in fact has good pace, but the problem is that all else seems to have been thrown overboard in order to achieve that. First off, good, sensible plot development - there are just far too many coincidences: why the hero just 'happens' to be next to where the woman is snatched, why the baddies don't get rid of him earlier (he's six-five, menacing and with a serious attitude problem!), etc, etc. And any character depth also goes out the window, particularly the baddies: they're all just a bunch of faceless, interchangeable morons who wave guns and shout dumb orders. Fast pace, but overall you can't help feeling this is just the book version of a rambo movie: seriously insulting to the intelligence."
2,Not the Best,"I recently discovered the Reacher series and had to backtrack to begin at the beginning. This was the third book I read and I could have skipped it and not missed a thing. Implausible from the beginning..Why would the kidnappers take a 6'5"" gorilla of a man cross country instead of just offing him when they torched the stolen car? Reacher ignores several chances to escape and get help for what seem very flimsy reasons, and as the story continues he is kept alive no matter how much trouble he causes. Although I have enjoyed the other Reacher novels this one doesn't add up."
5,Another page turner!,I have just finished the book - great story - great characters and you were kept guessing till the very end.
4,Even better than the first book!,"Quite a page-turner! The story is much faster and moves more fluidly than Killing Floor. Plenty of mystery too, one conundrum after another. There were a few small issues for me though. One annoyance throughout this book and even the first is that every character is constantly shrugging and saying, ""right?"" It's as if Jack Reacher lives in a world where everybody has the same mannerisms. Not really a big deal but it begins to nag a me after a while. Aside from that, I think Reacher's victory over the villain was intense and heart pounding, but the ending after that was somewhat underwhelming. Still a solid 4 out of 5 stars!"
5,Cover to cover,"Lee Child has me hooked. After ""The Killing Floor,"" I felt compelled to read ""Die Trying."" I'm glad I did. It's a great book, and I love Jack Reacher. The nice guy, who's not like the guy next door. It's a truly interesting story, and I read it from cover to cover, which I rarely do with books. Can't wait for his next, ""Tripwire"""
2,Die Trying,The book went into too many details. It would go on for several pages to describe facts. Not one of his best.
3,Not impressed,"Die Trying is lacking in so many areas. The plot is ridiculous, the book needed some editing, and I had I was infuriated with the constant describing of minor details of things.I give this 2.5 stars."
1,Sad product by author with great potential.,"Child has great potential as an action writer but lack of proper research and too many coincidences destroy one's abiltiy go along with the story. Example: Most FBI agents have not carried .38 revolvers with speed loaders in many years. Child needs to either educate himself as to all his facts or have someone who knows law enforcement and military facts edit his work for accuracy. ""Die Trying"" also had a very weak plot even though well written. He could be a great writer. I will not purchase another of his books until I see strong evidence of improvement."
4,Riveting second book in the series,"Jack Reacher is walking down the street in downtown Chicago and suddenly finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if you're Holly Johnson, maybe his timing was just perfect as Jack stepped into the middle of her abduction and was brought along for the ride.I was mesmerized by this story from the beginning as I followed Jack and Holly's journey to figure out what was going on. In typical Reacher form, he deduces the situation based on his unique ability to assembly information.The story does get bogged down, though, with a lot of details and facts I knew wouldn't make a difference for me in tracking the story. I found myself skimming a lot of material and, by the end, was glad I'd done so because I didn't feel I missed anything. Eliminating that detail might have made this a more taut thriller but I still enjoyed it and found it riveting. Otherwise, this would have been a five-star rated book, in my opinion."
5,Excellent action read,"Great action read. I have a hard time breaking away from reading these in several days. Start w/ 1st. ""Killing Floor"". Each book adds a little bit more to the character. Lee Child is #1 for a reason."
3,Not as good as the first outing,"The Jack Reacher series hits a minor Sophomore slump with this 2nd book in the series. The narrative becomes somewhat disjointed with too much switching back and forth between other characters - I estimate that around 35% of the book is told from the perspective of other characters. Still, if you're a fan all the trademarks are here - swift and brutal action and nuggets of backstory to help fill in the persona of Reacher."
5,Die Trying - Lee Childs,"Jack Reacher - the very best character in fiction today! Unbeatable twists and turns in the post-army adventures of the judicial vigilante, Jack Reacher, whose nomadic lifestyle leads him into his own brand of karmic delivery!"
2,"Good style, too many 'cliches'","Well written, as always, but no originality, too many 'deja-vu' and just too unrealistic."
1,"Same old, same old....","I have read 4 books of this author and they all are pretty much the same. The good guy rides into the little unknown town, a little old lady needs help, the bad guys ask the good guy to get out of their town and the good guy starts beating the hell out of the bad guys. This is getting boring, so I am done with Mr. Lee child. I feel once you read one, the rest are pretty much the same."
4,More shrugs per $,"Good action, good characters, well presented. Wish I had a dollar for every time the author used the word shrug or a form of it. I know this is a series, what is the author' s enamorement with that word. Really the only detractor from the book."
3,So annoying...,"I'm not even up to page 100 yet, but the writing style of this book annoys the crap out of me. Luckily I didn't start the Jack Reacher series from the beginning or I might not have read past Killing Floor. I will say the writing improves with his later books. Anyway, what's really bugging me is that EVERY character in this book at some point or other ends a sentence/statement with the word ""right"", in essence turning it into a question. Be it Reacher, Holly, the FBI agents, the local cop who's in the book for no more than a page, they all do it. Nobody talks that way. ""We're the FBI, right?"", ""I'm the general's daughter, right?"", ""They stole a car and burned it, right?"". Happens at least 3 times every page. And yes, as with Killing Floor, everyone in this book shrugs too, all the time."
2,Definitely not Killing Floor,"My first impression found no first person narrative, which I enjoyed in the first novel. The over use of ""right?"" and the shrugging made everyone seem like they had the same ""acting coach."" The FBI guys were interchangable for the first 3/4 of the book, and the female lead was fantastically annoying. In short, there was way too much ""everyone else"" and too little Reacher. Certain high tension moments in the book were totally unbelieveable (lasers from the sky ruse, and the gun to the chest). I really enjoyed the first book but found this story a severe disappointment."
3,Takes a long time to get going,This is the 2nd book in the series and the 2nd one I've read. This one was pretty slow in comparison and thought it was just ok.
1,He dit it again,After watching the movie I decided to start reading the books. I must say that I am quite thrilled. Child's action packed writing keeps the reader hooked from beginning to end. And Jack Reacher continues to evolve into the action hero of legend. Can't wait to read number three.
2,Don't buy this scanner,"There are paper jams, slow scanning, no scanning at all, difficulties learning how to use and set up the scanner. Sometimes it doesn't scan at all and then 10 mins later you get half a black page. No help downloading new drivers from Microtek's website. No help from the help desk. No advice online from anyone else. I feel like throwing it out of the window."
2,Save yourself the hassle,"I bought this to archive paper (like bills). The auto document feeder scans 2 pages, then says: out of memory, close programs to free up disk space. I have a brand new computer w/ 512k memory and an Athalon XP 2500 processor. This error is clearly from the Scan Wizard software the scanner comes with. I have rebooted and reinstalled to no avail. All in all I spent about 3 hours trying to scan 20 pages. Now I'm going to return it and buy the HP model with auto document feeder for $299. I guess you get what you pay for at only $140 for the Microtek 5950."
1,Two out of Two Defective,"Scanner lamp would not traverse and the ADF would not feed. It made aloud clacking noise when the scanner bar stalled out. Support said to return the scanner for a swap. The replacement scanner had hardware problems also. As a flatbed, scans were only long vertical lines. The ADF would feed paper, but again only vertical lines were the result. The software would stop the scan, saying ""out of memory"" ""close some applications"" (Lots of memory available and no running programs.) I am now awaiting the third (and final) swap from Microtek before I give up and try to get a refund from Amazon.com. Avoid the waste of time and grief and get another scanner."
4,"Great, solid toy.","Gave this to my 19 month old for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. And I love the all wood construction. The cars and other vehicles from this company are also great. Simple design, lightweight, and little rubber wheels that roll very smooth. I plan on buying more from this company to add on to the garage. My only complaint is that the ramps continue to fall off as they don't attach, they simply rest on the surface. Although, in another review, a customer indicated that he glued the ramps down, which seems like a simple enough fix. Great toy, highly recommend."
5,Great toy! Sturdy and fun!,I bought this for my 2 year old son. He absolutely loves it. It was not difficult to put together and it holds up well. Great for both other Plan Toy cars as well as Hot Wheels or Matchbox type cars.We have had it now for 3 years and it still looks great and has never broken. I definitley recommend this toy.
4,Great toy,"My three year old son has a lot of fun with this garage. There is a lot of space for his little cars. They either can enter the garage through the ramp or with the elevator, they can be washed and can get fuel at the gas station on the floor of the garage. The durability of the elevator is not so convinicing. It did not go to the ground completely any more after some days of intense playing."
3,Very Good but the new version 7.0 is much better,The Dragon 5.0 is good but the new 7.0 version is EXCELLENT and is the way to go if you want to optimize your money.Dragon 7.0 is very accurate and has more speech capabilites.
2,Typing is faster,"It does a fair job of recognizing simple text, but dictating an article out of, for example, the New York Times, stumps the program. Typing it, unfortunately, is much faster."
3,So far so good,"As far as I can tell these bags are doing the trick, but this new bag is currently not even half way filled."
1,Not For Sentria,These bags do not fit the Sentria properly. The attachment part is the wrong shape/size. The bags a regular paper and much smaller than the Kirby ones.
2,Picture is deceiving,"This product was not what I thought it was. I thought it was the white bag that fit on the newer kirbys however it was a brown bag that goes on the older ones. It doesn't fit too good, but I managed to get it on. It decreases the suction, though."
2,they do not fit a Kirby,"I have aKirby G 3, these do noy fit, how can I send them back. I have emailed the vendor but no response"
4,bags,They work great with my kirby a little harder to put on than the previous ones but the cost savings are worth it.
4,More than a sling - it assists healing,"A sling is another way of spelling 'pain'.The problem I've had with most slings is that my arm gradually slides until it is no longer supported by the sling. And it takes a lot of pulling and jerking to get it back in place.This sling hasn't slipped. I don't think it's going to. Once adjusted just where I want it, it keeps my arm supported, relieves stress on the bad shoulder, and keeps my hand close to my body, minimizing movement of the bad shoulder.Lightly padded, it's reasonably well made - you won't pass it on as an heirloom but who would want to. As long as it does its job for this surgery, I'm happy.So far, so good.I'll report back in a couple of months - 3/013 - if there is a problem."
2,not that great,"There are a few nice patterns, but there's nothing extrodinary about them. There's something about the writing between the patterns that I find somewhat condesending."
2,not all pins wired,"Found this out but wasn't worth my time to go about returning the product.Hopefully, this review will help others avoid this fate. I purchased two 3-foot cables. They work fine if you never put your monitor to sleep or turn off your computer with the monitor on. If you do, you will likely find a no-signal message on your screen and it will NOT go into sleep mode. I checked both cables. This is because (even though their are 15 pins on each end), they do not all have connection. I did not check but at least two of the pins are not wired.If you ALWAYS turn off your monitor when it is not in use, you should be fine with these cables. But if you forget or are not in the habit (like me) I would strongly recommend NOT purchasing these."
3,Cables to fat,"I can't use the cable because the cable is too fat to fit through the cord management hole on my monitor stand. So, I'm still using the one I was trying to replace. Will go to the store next time to make sure I don't have the same problem."
4,No More Hot Flash,Wouldn't live without it. I can sleep through the night and not wake up with hot flashes anymore. Would recommend to everyone going through this stage in their lives.
3,Dull. Read his earlier Work,"Sorry to be ""boring"" (you know, it seems odd to be bored by something but then reply at great length...), but this one is sluggish and poorly written as compared to his earlier work.What little is understandable in the plot is mundane and lacking grit."
5,Another gripping thiller from Dick Francis thanks to Amazon and KIndle,Thanks to his many years in racing this book brings you into the world of racing and you become one with the characters. Once you start mpossible to put it down.
3,Second Wind,"The novel started slowly, but got more interesting about half way through. Not his best although I did enjoy reading it while hurricanes are whirling off the Alantic coast this September."
1,A great disappointment,"I first started reading Dick Francis when I bought Dead Cert for my father, a horse-racing enthusiast, who was sick. I became an avid fan and have all 39 of his books on my shelves. Unhappily, in recent years, I have been buying them more from ""loyalty"" than enjoyment. Field of Thirteen was a ""cop-out""(a collection of previously published short stories) but Second Wind, after initial chapters reminiscent of his earliest and thoroughly entertaining mysteries, just fizzles out and dies. The plot is unbelievable and all of his characters, without exception, are weakly/thinly drawn. A major disappointment and any reader who enjoyed Second Wind cannot possible have read his early works."
2,Quite Poor from a usually great writer,"I am a big Dick Francis fan, but I did not care for this book. The plot was a bit too fantastic for me, and I had difficulty following it. Maybe it was because Mr. Francis deviated from his forte which as everyone knows is the horse world and everything in it. I hope that he decides to go back to that world in his next book."
2,Not for the professional,"This book is for the hobbyist painter, though possibly not for an absolute beginner. It's mostly a picture book with step by step instructions on basic techniques, and materials. It covers how to set up a studio, and composition, and glosses over portraiture and figure painting.I got it mostly because I'm looking to increase my knowledge of glazing. There are a handful of techniques and that chapter takes up maybe one fifth of an already thin book. It talks very little about advanced technique, nor does it go in depth into techniques. For someone who has experience in painting and is looking for an in depth resource look elsewhere."
1,Not tea at all!,"Horrible, terrible, so bad! I cannot warn one strongly enough not to purchase this product with the assumption that you will be making a raspberry flavored TEA. This is much more of a raspberry flavored drink and not a good one at that."
5,Great Tips for Growing the Right Flowers for Drying,"Already a classic on the subject of dried flower gardening, this book has been re-released.Choose your dried flower plants by color, method and or part to dry. Or, use one of Ms. Sheen's designs to get your garden jump started.What do you fancy? An Orange, Yellow, White and Green Garden?And, do you want that in perennials or annuals or both?The extensive A-Z of Recommended Plants section examines her choices of plants in comprehensive detail, providing insight into each variety that only an experienced gardener can offer.Methods of harvesting, drying and storing are clear and easy to follow,as are her craft ideas for everything from a simple bouquet to an elegant Autumn potpourri.With Dried Flower Gardening you can enjoy the garden, fresh and forever."
1,Choose another 3 in 1 ...................,I should have paid more attention to earlier reviews...this item is not worth the money....the IPOD clamp does not have a tightening screw..the cig lighter fit is not tight (it loosens out)...the overall quality is very cheap.......but most of all there is background noise pick up (engine noise)and static hum on all/every available non broadcasting station. Pass on this model and select a different brand/company.....
4,Great Book for a Beginner,"I bought this book to figure out what to do with all my fat quarters. I just started quilting about 7 months ago and I have become a fabric addict. This book has some very nice quilts in it and I do think that I could make many of the quilts in the book. If you understand the basics of cutting fabric and sewing it together but you aren't quite ready for something that requires many different techniques, this would be a great guide for you."
3,This book is only okay....,"This book is nice in that it has many quilt patterns for fat quarters. The photos are in color and the directions seem easy to follow to complete the projects. However, the down side for me on this book was I didn't care for the patterns or color choices. I realize you can change up the colors, but I have to be inspired by the quilt if I'm to attempt to make it, and these modern style quilts just didn't do it for me. It's a personal thing I quess, but if your like me and like the warmer, traditional type patterns and colors... you will be disappointed in this book."
4,Definitely ordering some more!,"The Film arrived on time, sealed, and new. I am completely happy and can't wait to use it. Definitely ordering more! :)"
5,This is an excellent compilation of board games.,"This CD more than lives up to its promise. There are so many games you could spend years getting to them. The checkers game is impressive because it is 3 dimensional, not like the mechanistic shareware programs you thought were good. The characters you play against add a lot to the games too."
4,List price ain't $20,"The actual product is good. The list price is NOT $20. that has to be a lie. it's a tiny amount. i bought mine at Sally for 1/4 that cost. (i think i can say that.) One ounce is TINY - it's 1/12 of a can of coke. just reminding everyone to check qty.The actual product works well. As many salons are now using this type of wax, I find it easy also. You layer on a thickish coat and it dries and you peel it off. much better than trying to use strips. It's painful on the upper lip - but honestly what isn't? you have to be fast or get help, that's all. I think it's pretty awesome. Works well on other face areas too - and not painful in less sensitive areas."
4,Solid worship,"The Crabb family does it again.Since becoming a fan I've found a wealth of material that blesses my personal worship time.This particular album has more of a southern gospel edge than some of the others, so if you're a Christian and a country music fan, you'll really enjoy this one."
3,Not for first time college algebra takers,I had already taken col alg just had to retake it because my credits didn't transfer. I would not reccomend this book for first time takers because it skips alot of steps. All lot of material you are expected to already know.
1,MUCH Esplainin' to do!,"This is the worst math textbook I have ever had the misfortune of coming into contact with. It does no real explaining at all, with the easiest possible examples and no step by step aid. It reminds me of a reclusive, bumbling but idiotic savant genius trying to explain something...in another language! The examples were skeleton problems; worked out in shortcut ways with no reasoning or explaination behind them. There was a little module on the sidebar titled ""In words"" that would be helpful, but there were too few of them and they were too short. It was very disappointing. Most people use the textbook as supplementary to instructor's notes and lectures, but this book was like the bare bones, with every other piece missing."
4,Very nice watch,"Looks very nice, light weight, wrist band is very comfortable. Always has the exact time. The only complaint I have is with the back light. At night, when I turn the back light on, it is almost impossible to see what time it is because everything inside the watch is lit up. Otherwise I love it."
5,Excellent value for four spark plugs,"NGK Spark Plug BPR5ESThe FOUR spark plugs are value priced and arrived quickly. The gap is factory set to 0.035, so there is nothing to do except tighten one of them in place. I also replaced the air cleaner on my ExMark lawn mower; it now starts on the first pull and runs smoothly."
5,An Outstanding Tango Collection,"If this work is typical of that by Carlos Di Sarli, then he may well deserve the title 'El Senor Del Tango'. This work represents my first encounter with Di Sarli and I found it to be an impressive collection of Argentine Tango. From start to finish, a very enjoyable CD!"
5,I love this movie. . .,"This is one of my all time favorite classics! Basil Rathbone plays Pontious Pilate, a man plagued by questions and doubts with his decision to crucify Christ and whether or not Christ was worthy of crucifiction. This movie deals with what really is important in life and it does it tastefully. Preston Foster is the man who has lost everything, including his family; gains wealth as a fighting gladiator, then comes to the conclusion in the end about what is really valuable. I can watch this film over and over again without getting tired of it."
4,7 Pieces for Solo Piano,The performance of the 7 Pieces for Solo Piano are different than what I expected. I have only heard the piece performed for a specific piece of choreography. This offers a different interpretation. That difference has made me consider different ways to perform it on the piano and also how it is performed to accompany choreography. It is worth taking several listening experiences and then going back into yourself and rethink your own interpretation for performance.
4,Good wipes,"Would have to disagree with the last review. Have used pampers. We SWITCHED because while using our WIPE WARMER the pampers were drying out very quickly. Sometimes half the stack went bad. The huggies do not dry out as quickly while using the warmer. They are THICKER so you use less of them while cleaning up messy diapers. The only reason why I didnt rate them a 5 is because I do not love the smell of them, especially when you open a new bag. They smell like alcohol."
4,Good product by packaging is bad,The product works just like others I've worn in the past and shopping online is easy but the packaging is bad. I would not have purchased had I know the packaging was so large and the type used a few years back when the product first came out. It's very bulky unlike the newer package that folds over and can easily be stored in a drawer. This packing requires alot of space on the shelf. Hope they move to the more modern packaging because it's so much easier to store and reuse.
1,Poor Monitor at Best,I have gone through 4 of these monitors in the last 4 years. The first two were replaced under warranty after burning out. After two years of use both of the replacement monitors burned out within a week apart.
3,Phil's Psyche Gets a Public Workout,"Our pal Phil comes out in gold lame and marries folk protest to rock and roll and country in a mindblowing soul-baring performance. It doesn't all work by any stretch.He just doesn't have the voice to cover Elvis, but he does well with the Buddy Holly medley and Merle Haggard's traditionalist chestnut, ""Okie From Muskogee"". Though Ochs was wearing down, his own songs sound purty good, and the loooooose band is at least fired up... Wonder if there's more tape in the vaults."
4,Good for $2,"It's worth the $2, but if you want some proffesional stuff, you might want something a little bit better.Oh by the way for the idiot who shot himself.It's a bb gun vest, not a real gun vest. You must be really stupid to shoot yourself with a real gun. I'm pretty sure Kevlar can't even stop a bullet at point blank."
3,"nice, but small","Overall, this item is a wonderful product. I wear everytime I play airsoft with my friends. I've been hit a few times with it on and I haven't felt a thing. There's just one problem: it's too small. The straps are for a tiny person! If you're looking for a cheap way to protect your torso, this item has the best value."
2,iffy,i bought this vest last week and it was ok a first... but the straps started to break and it just went down hill from there. i would not buy this vest.
2,Uninspiring,I don't see the point of this video. It is essentially a showcase for Hilary's dancing which is technically excellent and undoubtedly authentic but somewhat uninspiring.It says on the case it can be used as an advanced instruction video but no movement instruction is included. The explanations of the various rhythms are so brief as to be worthless and I have similar feelings about the finger cymbal instruction - why is a section on such basic finger cymbals included in an advanced video anyway?Advanced learners who find improvisation difficult are unlikely to draw inspiration from this video which I found frankly tedious and definitely overpriced.
3,Hilary's site has the following description:,"Filmed with live Egyptian music - Haggag Metqal on tabla, Essam ElMatrawi on douf and AlGamal ElSaghir on keyboards. You can use this as an advanced instruction video or simply as a performance video to sit back and enjoy. Hilary goes through four rhythms - Whada Kebira, Maqsoum, Saaidi and Fellahi, first with the drums alone and then set to music. Also featured are the song Nasa and the Baladi with taqasim and drum solo. There is also some beginners finger cymbal instruction."
1,Same game different title,"My wife and I loved the original,and hoped the 2002 version would be even better. It is exactly!the same;even the copywrite date says 2001. What's going on. The description inthe advertising is not true. I also bought Hoyle ""Slots &videopoker"". These are also the same games no additional or different ones same copywrite date 2001."
3,Overall great game,"The Hoyle Casino 2002 is tops in graphics and sounds.(The muffled background sound is a nice addition that just provides for experience)The variety and quality of games are terrific, and I've found enough variable 'luck' to have good runs and bad runs, just like at any casino.The worst part about this are the character animations. Great animations, annoying characters. Thankfully, you can edit them to where they don't say anything, but it should be an option right off, not something you have to figure out after you've decided that those characters need to die!!Also, in regards to characters, I would have liked to have created my own characters. You get tired of playing them after a while, and frankly, the face maker option is kind of fun to play with.Not a waste of money at all, if you enjoy gaming."
4,Be sure to check Disk 3 for playing problems!,"So far I have purchased and returned two sets for defects in Disk 3. The defects have differed slightly in each disk, but the disk was ultimately unplayable. Check your set as soon as possible in case you need to return it. Otherwise the set is excellent except for the lack of a ""play all"" feature."
2,"Great Show, Bad Transfer","I have now had 2 different copies of season three, and both copies of disk 3 would not play or would stutter through the final episodes on the disk. I think that Fox need to retransfer the third disk.Amazon was great by sending me an immediate replacement the first time, but the replacement had the same issue. I blame Fox for this one. I tried it on 2 DVD players, and my PS2, with the same result."
5,Mash 3rd Season,Great video and wonderful seller. Would not hesitate to do buesiness with this person again.
2,Great show-Substandard Packaging,"I never understand why these dvd producers always leave the fans of the show with a dissatisfied feeling that should be nothing but pleasure. I've always loved MASH. I've always loved collecting dvds. However, after purchasing the set, the ""love"" turned to disdain. The set is compact, enough so that FOX believed they could ""smash"" all the discs together and stack them on top of each other to prove to themselves that they could take a five star show and make it an unnerving garbage. To make the product worse, they decided to save more money by not including a program guide, or at minimum, a list of episodes. The ""Collector's"" edition is much better; discs are properly separated and their is a program guide."
5,Great Series,Southland is a good crime drama. It makes you feel for the characters.It feels real. Police dramas that tells all sides of the issues are worth watching.
3,jury is still out,"To be really fair, I have just decided to test product for a longer period of time before writing review. Thanks very much."
1,Pay more and get something that works,"I thought that this could be a good cost benefit dvd, however it does not work. When I press skip chpater it locks and takes 30s to complete the operation. The built in batery limits the life, since you can not buy a new one to replace the old one.I recommend spend US$ 50 or US$ 70 more and buy something better."
4,"nice, inexpensive, works great","It's inexpensive, it works right out of the box, and the quality of the picture and sound seem just fine. The toddler loves it, the husband loves it, and it does entertain. It is a bit of a pain to get around some headrests (so you might want to get a bulldog clip or something to get it to hang right) but it is well worth the price."
4,Nice Machine,I am very happy with this DVD player. I bought it for my tread mill and it works fine. The sound is not good without the headphones and you have to play around a little with the screen to get the right viewing angle. It is very easy to load and doesn't require a Master's in Engineering to set up. All in all for the price I don't see how you can go wrong.
2,Not Great as a Quick Reference,"I'm a native English speaker but speak several other languages as well and sometimes get the rules mixed up. So I was looking for a quick reference guidebook to confirm that the grammatical lessons ingrained from my elementary education, such as, ""i before e except after c..."" etc. are still valid. Unfortunately, this book is poorly organized in such fashion that one has to read it chapter by chapter and can't really just focus on the specific grammatical rule you want to refresh your knowledge on. This may be good as a learning tool, but I would not recommend it for someone who already has a solid handle of the English language."
1,Developmental Experts say these are BAD FOR BABY,"I'm going to write this on all the Exersaucers. I was considering purchasing one of these for my daughter who is 8 months old. However both a physical therapist and an occupational therapist told me that I shouldn't waste my money on one. They said that they are not good for babies because they don't encourage the proper development of the muscles and the proper development of the postures needed for standing and walking. Many times, babies who use these, even for short periods will develop bad habits such as standing on tippy toes or having their legs face the wrong direction and this can delay when they walk on their own. I know that this is tempting because of all the activities on there, but they said a playpen is much better."
2,MY PREVIOUS REVIEW LEFT OUT ...,"I FORGOT TO MENTION THE FROG & PURPLE SUN...WHAT IS WITH THE WAY THE FROG IS ATTACHED? THAT LITTLE PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT STICKS OUT? ANOTHER THING MY SON PULLS DOWN & TEETHES ON. ANOTHER THING I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT-WHEN HE LETS GO OF IT-ITS GOING TO BOUNCE UP & SCRATCH HIS EYE OR FACE! AND THAT PURPLE SUN SHAPED THING, WITH THE HARD ROUNDED POINTS! BABIES LOOK DOWN ON THINGS SUCH AS THIS & ARE UNABLE TO JUDGE DISTANCE...IF HE WERE TO BANG HIS EYE LETS SAY ON THIS, HE WOULD REALLY GET HURT!MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 2 STARS...MY SON IS 5 MONTHS OLD...SOFTER TOYS PLEASE EVENFLO!!!"
2,everything but rattle,"Overall, it's attractive, conveniently portable toy.My only complaint is the orange jester rattle. My baby was gnawing on the head and it got stuck by the roof of his mouth. I don't recall if he was gagging or choking 'cuz i was in such a state of shock.Attachments that are flexible, stand above the baby's eye-level, are not baby-friendly, especially to chewers & gnawers."
4,"Wonderful, but be careful!","My 5 month old son loves this saucer, though we did have to remove 2 of the toys. The toy with the orange fins and the blue toy with mirror are too dangerous. Our son was wacked pretty hard by both. Would be better if all toys were soft like the frog and flag. Simply remove those 2 toys and your child will LOVE IT!"
2,Too Busy! and Dangerous!,"My mother bought this for my 4 1/2 month old son. We started out with one toy at a time so we wouldn't shock him with all the toys. After we added 3 items he sat in it for about 15 minutes and then started to cry because he was so frustrated with all the colors. The reason i am returning this item is not just because of this, he may not be ready for all that entertainment yet. The biggest reason is the toys are not baby friendly. One in particular is a rattle that he wanted immediately but when he put it to his mouth it almost made him choke and it was way to sharp. I watched him for a while with this toy and I could see how this could cause serious harm to him. We are going to get another one that has safer toys on it and softer items."
2,"great toy, but wrong parts","This is a great toy, after I finally put it together , the babies love it. However, the rocker came with out the right type of screws. I was amazed by this, and almost broke the thing trying to put the right screws in place. Even the pictures in the instructions have different types of screws. The company has received a copy of my letter, but they never wrote back. It was just lucky that I was able to buy the correct screws."
4,Love It!,"I began putting my daughter in the Exersaucer when she was about 5 months old. I should have put her in it earlier! She loves it! She's nine months old now and close to walking. But she loves to bounce and play with the toys. She has never gotten hurt with any of the toys and always smiles when she's in the Exersaucer. The only down fall, is don't buy it for the ""folding"" feature. I picked this item for the unique feature that it folded. It's very difficult to fold down quickly. If you need to travel it'll fold fine, but not for easy clean up. Otherwise, great item."
5,This toy does the trick!,"My twin girls take turns playing with this toy and loves to sit in it. We bought it at 4 months of age and they are now 10 months. They bounce quite a bit in it and enjoy chewing on the flag and frog. It is not stable enough for them to pull up on when outside of the toy, which they sometimes try to do if it is in the room and they are not in it. There is no volume control on the musical toys, but it is quiet, overall. It collapses quite easily and the toys can be taken off and/or moved around."
5,Romance and history a winning mix!,"I was surprised to find a reader giving this book one star because of two minor and insignificant ""slips"" (the age of one child and whether or not an event occurred one or two days prior). Yes, every author and editor should strive for perfection in detail but, more importantly, Ms. Kennedy has striven for and achieved near perfection in her blending of historical fact, intrigue, romance, and a wit seldom seen in romance novels. I note that the reader did not point out any historical slips -- a far greater error in a book of this type. Ms. Kennedy has obviously done her historical homework. At the same time she has given us characters and a story line which set this novel a step above. Kudos!"
5,Ballad Of Calico,"This is by far the best album ever put out by Kenny Rodgers!!! Mine is still in exceptional shape, but would love this remastered and put to CD. Obviously I can not play the record in my vehicles! I almost hate to play this record anymore because it is so rare!williebthere"
1,Do you like having to fold your socks under at the toe?,"Nowhere in the listing can I find the size of these socks. I am tired of buying socks that are built to fit any size from 6 to 12, and then having to fold and inch or two under at the toe in order to fit my size 7 1/2 foot. Apparently with no size shown, these socks will fit any size foot, and therefore will not give a good fit to anyone with a shoe size smaller than about 12. Such a deal."
2,MISLEADING TITLE,"Given the spate of good ""Then/Now"" books available which line up old photos with new ones--I find this book's title highly misleading. There is not one comparative photo set in the entire book (and many of the photos are available in other books.)"
1,Pyramex Canister With 100 Lens Cleaning Tissues,"Wasteful! Have always used the individual wipes with good results. With the canister, the sheets do not tear at perforations and are a hassle to use! I would not buy or recommend!"
4,Excellent for long term test preparation,"This is a very helpful guide for picking up more vocabulary words in preparation for the GRE. This is not a book conducive to last minute cramming however....if you are scheduled to test in a few months, or you just want to brush up on your word power, then Word Smart is a good way to pick up a few words every week."
3,Not so great,"I cannot give this book a super high recommendation.I actually got 670 on my verbal for my GRE, but this book didn't give me much help.Let me put it this way, in order to get really high grades in GRE verbal, you need a decent amount of advanced vocabulary. The list of words here is insufficient to give you a good score.I believe that the only people who will benefit from this book are people who already has very good vocabulary and are looking for a quick review on more important words.The ideal books are recommended in my listmania! for vocabulary building."
4,Works great!!,We are using the cords fr video projections in a stage production. The video quality is great at 150 feet away from the source. We are using projectors to add video effects to Willy Wonka. We need high quality video projection and we got it!
2,Better upon reflection,"While this book did turn out to be slightly borning, I found a number of things that redeemed it. One of the most pleasant surprises can be found in the teaching that the old man does. He uses every situation as a lesson, passing on anecdotes, proverbs, stories and rules for living. Throughout the book, the boy picks up the knowledge of how to be a gentleman, be responsible and live life to the fullest: all compliments of the old man. Some of this wisdom is not easy to find, but looking back after reading the book I saw that I was richer for having done so."
4,Fun,A fun little Tomb Raider style movie with some really good martial arts in it. Don't expect a deep story just have fun with it.
3,Not bad as a story concept; needed better execution,"This is a good concept, with conjoined twins being separated physically but not emotionally or mentally. Margot Kidder does a great job as Danielle, whose ex-husband is also the one who treated her surgically. Jennifer Salt is even better as a young reporter who witnesses the twins doing something terrible and takes it upon herself to investigate the matter, putting herself in great danger as a result.The score is really awful, though, and some of the flashback or hallucinatory scenes are clumsy and just not very effective. These things take away from the film in some ways.It's decent entertainment for killing an hour and a half."
1,"Hilarious romp, great camp","It's great camp. I'll give it that.But let's get serious, nothing holds up to Hitchcock as much as DePalma would have you compare his movie with a masterpiece like Psycho. The script is pure camp, the blood is paint red, and it's not scary at all, just funny. All of the technical mastery, such as tracking shots, plot twists, etc, all feels very very shallow when you have such over-the-top performances and laughable lines. There is no real depth to any of DePalma's movies. They can be fun and uproarious at times but never compelling."
5,Thanks Again Criterion-for Sisters' return!,"A must own for anyone who ever enjoeyd a De Palma film. This is as they say ""A lost classic"". I have had a tape of it for quite some time, but it has not been generally available for many, many moons. Thank god for Criterion(again)-who have breathed new life into this remarkable De Palma thriller. Has lots of De Palma trademark split screens-with characters viewing eachother. A great trbute to Hitchcock(one of many from De Palma)-this one's a lot like Psycho meets Rear Window meets a siamiese twin movie. Great, great film- here widescreen with lots of extras-how can any film buff possible resist!"
2,false advertising,"The 4-disc set I just purchased claims ""The Complete First Season"" and ""Includes 5 unaired episodes!"" This is completely false. Three episodes that aired are missing, ""Threshold"", ""Bacon"" and ""Fear."" And there are only 3 un-aired episodes ""Eve Ate the Apple"", ""Venus"", and ""Kiss."" I feel completely ripped off. And since one has to open the package, it can't be returned for full price. Beware!"
2,Drag CD,"This is terrible. The sound is muddy mono and the screaming crowd almost sounds better than the music. Other then ""Surf City"" and ""Dead Man's Curve"" which features Jan I don't know who is singing what. This might be ok for those who saw them live late in their career and want a souvenir of their performance or collectors who want everything they did. As poor as the sound is, I did enjoy Jan having fun singing ""Dead Man's Curve"" which is why I gave it 2 stars."
3,poorly done,"This is pretty badly sung,but I can't find too many (none)lives out there!I am a collector of cd's so I guess this will have to do.Wish I knew where & when this took place?"
1,"like captian america,this is really just drawings with speach","i remember watching this when i was young, but the fact that this is just som drawings and not a cartoon now makes it hopeless and not much to watch!!!!"
3,Bad Brad,Great book but-It Says Samantha is pregnat and then bridal dreams? Is she pregnat with or with outs Tor's child. Is she still getting married even thoguh she is pregant?
3,"If you like Lisa Hartman, and you like seeing just wear a shirt for a whole movie, you'll like this","This was a tv movie that was meant to be a romantic comedy and does a so so job of being charming and amusing. But I'll admit the reason I bought it is because I've been in love with Lisa Hartman since I was six and I couldn't pass up watcing her run around on an island basically just wearing a shirt with a bikini underneath. For that alone I'm very happy. To be fair while it is just fluff it is pleasant and has some funny moments, plus I'm sure the ladies will like Gregory Harrison, and I've certainly seen worse ""Stranded on Desert Isle"" comedy so check it out if it's of interest to you."
2,A compromised recording of a neglected work,"Is there a trade descriptions act when it comes to cuts in an opera performance? The sleeve does state 'Bregenz Festival Edition' - what it does not convey is that more than 50 minutes of the opera is cut - amounting to a third of the score. The last act is literally ripped to shreds - much of the more familiar music from the orchestral suite is missing, this it seems, is because Harry Kupfer, the director of the production disagrees with the visionary ending of this epic, turning a final scene in paradise into the lead characters hallucination. Kitezh is a flawed, epic, probably overlong piece but it deserves better than this textual mauling. Performance is live, much stage noise, committed if not very beautiful performances from Prokina and Galusin. But be warned, this is an abridgement, not the whole work."
3,"""Interesting,"" but...","Well, what an interesting concept, I thought.Yes, the concept of recording these seminal works of anti establishment people power with an orchestra is indeed interesting. What, unfortunately is less interesting is the end result.Though the melodic forms that were perhaps somewhat masked in the original performances shine through these undoubtedly well performed pieces, the sad fact is that lacking a full orchestra - this seems to be to be only a string section - the full power of the punk revolution is sadly lacking.If a full orchestra, with percussion, brass, woodwind, etc. had been employed the result might have been more invigorating and memorable.What remains is a flawed (IMHO) experiment that leaves you feeling as if you have been trapped in a lift for an hour."
1,Didn't fit,"These towel bar ends are described to fit any towel bar, but they did not fit mine. They came in a small bag of about 6 of them, so I am stuck with a bag of these little things. Glad I didn't pay too much as I ended up breaking out the tile anyway to replace the broken towel bar. Which buying these was supposed to avoid.If you do buy these make sure the diameter will fit inside your towel bar."
1,Not what I expected!,"There were only 45 pages in this little book, not the 96 specified. And the cover is different than the one shown in the picture. Very misleading."
2,Not so good actually,"I've spent the last 5 years learning about serial killers and killers in general, I've read at least 50 books on the subject of 'profiling' and 'psycho-geographical profiling' and I've learned one thing, NOBODY knows how to do it right, the best ones to look at are the ones that say ""It can't be done accuratly, everything you do is guess work becuase nobody can know the human mind, exspecially not someone elses"" and this book is one of the worst..because this guy gets 'close' to finding something he says ""I did it, I proved it"" and demeans FBI profilers by saying ""they're just guessing"" then goes and says in his OWN profiles ""In my OPINION""...I donated my copy to the local library, hopefully they'll find a use for it."
5,Good fit,So far so good. They fit perfectly on my 2004 GMC Sierra 1500 4x4 5.3L. Truck seems to run better now
1,Aren't we all a bunch of simpering victims...,"Miller has spent decades taking the money of people she has convinced that ""everything that is wrong with your life is your parents' fault."" For God's sake people--take responsibility for your own lives, get a few weeks of professional cognitive treatment (Miller's pseudo-Freudian crap is from the middle ages!) and get on with deciding to be happy in an imperfect existence! These books are not scientific and simply give you the sympathy bath that will keep you in the infantile state that led you to buy the books in the first place. (""Buy another one, poor baby! I have written lots and lots, always saying the same thing!"")"
5,The Body Never Lies,"Anyone who believes that they have suffered at the mercy of parents who were less than nurturing ought to read this book, especially if they think and/or feel that they have challenges ""moving on."" Be prepared to think for yourself."
5,Classic Crabs,"Night of the Crabs is perhaps one of the finest books I have ever read and I have read alot. Everthing you could possibly want is here in under 150 pages. Murder, mutations, crabs and Cornwall is here. The sex scene alone bought me to tears.You will feel cheaper but happier for reading this book."
1,Sent me the wrong charger,Been trying to get a new charger for monthsFinally able to order one at the beginning of the weekGot it today and it is not the charger pictured
5,WTF?!,"The factory lights from the Kawasaki dealer are ~$60! Lololololololol!!! These are great bulbs, at a fantastic price. I am using these in my '07 KAWASAKI ZZR600. They look identical to the stock bulb. I highly recommend these bulbs.~$60 at the dealer... lolololololol!"
3,Extra Set,"Bought the Rampage headlights, did not state they had bulbs, so bought these.The Rampage came with bulbs when it arrived. These bulbs came a week later. Had already installed the others, so keeping for back up. Have heard good reviews on Hella, so expect them to work well when needed."
3,Messe of Sacre bleu!,"I ordered this copy of Napoleon's Coronation Mass expecting a more professional presentation in terms of mixing. Particularly during the ""Vivat,"" I found it shrill. The cymbals are a special irritant. They overpower the music and sound powerful enough to be computer generated. The ""Vivat"" was the main reason I ordered this disc. I still, enjoy it because I can imagine how it should sound. Done correctly, it would be a much more rewarding listen. The male's soloist's portamento during the ""Gloria"" was sloppy, slding into notes rather hitting them with precision. Most charming is the ""Tu es Petrus"": no special effects, only the music itself.Short of the above, I recommend this piece as long as you don't expect excellence and have some idea how each band should sound."
3,"Well made, but airport security problem","Stitched together well, but...the metal zipper heads (three of them) lit up airport security scanners. Wearing a long sleeved shirt, I looped it over my neck and under my arm. Big Mistake! Had to take my shirt off to remove the pouch for inspection, as the pouch cord cannot be untied. So much for secrecy. Also, cannot see a way to move the springed device, used to shorten the cord, from the middle of the strap support, causing it to push out at the back of my shirt collar. I assume this device has a metal spring, which may have contributed to the security alert. I'm also assuming here it wasn't the magnetic stripes on credit cards stored in the pouch that caused the problem."
2,Victorinox Deluxe Neck Pouch,"I purchased this pouch, (which I felt was pretty pricey, but I believe you get what you pay for...) for my teenage daughter's trip to Spain. Two days into the trip, she tells me the neck strap broke, & she had to buy another pouch cause they had to keep their passports w/them throughout the 11day trip!! Unbelievable!!! I was very disappointed w/ this product."
3,Not for Preschoolers,"This is not a picture book for preschoolers. There are very few pictures and plenty of text in this book and some pages have no pictures at all. My three year old lost interest quickly and kept wanting to turn the page to see more pictures. My five year liked it ok but has not asked to read it again. The stories are fine, but I would say this is a book for Pooh fans who are six and up."
2,Close just isn't good enough.,"This product is a wonderful idea, but isn't quite there in execution. It seems to me that a lot of B&D products are like that--very nifty and very creative but poorly made. The laser level on my unit just isn't level. There is no way to adjust it, and even if you buy it in a store, no way to verify it before you buy, as you should with all levels. I've found that only about 1/4 of all bubble levels off the shelf are accurate. What good is an inaccurate level? I now have a $60 studfinder sitting in my garage. 1 star for creativity, and 1 star for the studfinder."
1,ordering from amazon market place,"I would not recommend this, if you order from them, it is not really amazon and if something is backordered you can't cancel the order and it still comes to you and then you have to return it and wait to HOPEFULLY get a refund."
1,overpriced and not very functional,The stud finder in this is totally worthless. The laser lines are too thick and distort too soon to be much good either except maybe for hanging pictures in a 5 foot space. Way overpriced for what you get. I received mine as a gift or I'd have returned it.
1,Did not work on my jeep,"This item physically fit on my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee limited. However, it did not function. After installing, every warning light went off on the dash board, and the vehicle would not leave from ""Park"". I wound up getting another one from the OEM, and it worked without issue."
5,"Extremely refreshing, honest and non emotional presentation of research","Personally I found the book, ""Shattering the Myths of Darwinism"" by Richard Milton to be extremely refreshing, profound, enlightening, totally honest, free of emotion and cuts through dogmatism of both polarized positions (neo Darwinists and so called ""Scientific Creationists"") I found Richard Milton's book to be very honest and intelligent without the vilification and arrogance often found by some credentialed authors. The honest enquirer looking for truth loses out by not reading this book."
3,An OK remix single,"I really only like two of the tracks a lot, whereas; I think the rest of the tracks are OK and some, even, very repetative. As far as this single is compared to the rest of the Orgy singles, this one is the worst. But I do like this single never the less."
1,Keep This Away from all Orgy Albums,"I am a die-hard Orgy fan and expected a great single because the one on the album is terrific. I admit other singles and remixes like Stitches are great, but these just ruined the song. Orgy should make remixes of the song with all the lyrics and keep it simple. They have alot to learn to keep famous."
1,Watch for Size Switch,"When I tried to order one of these jackets (red, from Axls Closet), it said Women's on the order page and Kids in the shopping cart ... just like some reviewers stated. Needless to say, I did not complete the order."
2,Very light weight.,I ordered this as it resembled the Cabela's one I wanted when we were there. It was the perfect color and loved the cap type hood. This was very thin and not roomy for another jacket underneath (Like a hoodie or columbia liner).It's cold in Pennsylvania and a light weight raincoat is not what I expected for the price. I had no problems returning it or getting my refund. I would deal with this company again.
5,Perfect and Tasty!,"The perfect size and taste for my gum-ball machine. While the original gum-balls I had for my machine were large, these are a bit smaller than I expected.. but I have found that I enjoy the size and taste of these MUCH more than any other gum-balls I have purchased.And it isn't just me, my friends literally twist and twist and TWIST the dial on my machine trying like mad to get as many into their mouths as they can... yes, they are that delicious."
5,adam 12 season 2,"Its about time , but well worth the wait. I hope they dont wait 5 years to do season 3 and so on, heck if they wait that long i will be dead by the time season 5 comes out. If you like old cop shows you will love this show and you will want to add this serial to your collection. Shout Factory please release the rest of the adam 12 seasons , you did a great job Thank you"
5,Great for mac users with small hands,"I liked the puck-style mouse that came with my G4/450 mac because my hands are small. But after a few years, it eventually started skipping around even after I cleaned the ball and the rollers. I like the Logitech optical scrollwheel mouse on my pc so I bought something similar to it for my mac. I went to CompUSA first to compare mice visually because for me, size IS important. Of course, I bought it at Amazon because the prices are so much better here. The Kensington Iridio optical three button scrollwheel fits the bill. It's smaller than the average mouse so it fits my hand, ready to go for the mac and I like that clicking the scrollwheel makes a link open in a tab in Safari. I also have the option to create my own default settings for clicking buttons by using the enclosed software. Plus, it really is quite attractive and matches the look of my graphite mac."
2,click! click! click!,"1. it clicks really loudly, enough to annoy me and anyone in proximity to my computer2. the scroll jumps around just like it was described by another reviewer, and it happens in all applications/programs (i'm running apple os 10.2)3. it is a comfortable shape, but that's not enough to keep me happy...4. i'm shopping for another mouse."
3,Good...not great.,"I bought this DVD primarily for the comedy of Melanie Comarcho. She is hilarious and SO underrated! I couldn't find anything with her on it, with the exception of a handful of YouTube clips. (BTW, I recommend you checking out ""Independent Women"" on YouTube)So, since I'm a huge Katt Williams fan, I thought I'd get this and see if it was any good. It's good. Not great. Katt doesn't perform on it, and there are two other comedians besides Melanie. The male comic was awful. I tried to enjoy him but he just wasn't funny. The blonde lady was good....I laughed out loud at her and of course the highlight was Melanie.So, overall I'd say add it to your collection if you're a huge comedy fan. Otherwise, you could do without."
2,It's Ai' ight,"The funniest moments were shown in American Hustle. The video seemed rushed (like they shot it all in one night) and ill prepared, low budget. Only for true Red, Luenell and Melanie fans."
4,This is how I was introduced to Felicia Day,"Because of her appearance in this video, I found here on YouTube where she has started a channel named ""Geek & Sundry"" She is probably better known for her part in the YouTube series, ""The Guild"" At any rate, I like this movie and if you think you might too, I'd recommend you check out ""Geek & Sundry"" on YouTube too."
1,Poor quality product,"I'm sure the product is good but the sellers on amazon are scam artists!!I attempted to return the faulty product but no response fom the seller or amazon or infintySo if you decide to but any infinty product beware you don't get what you pay forI"" am going to go buy a Sony"
1,Pointless and Useless drivel!!!,This book was so unrealistic. It made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I would not recommend a struggling couple on tight budget to waste thier money on this book. Spend on your wedding. There was no advice about having a great wedding on a small budget. It was old fashioned ideas that any women with some sense of style and reality would choose for their wedding.
2,Not worth the money,"If you are really trying to throw a wedding for under 5,000 you can't afford this book. The book could have been called how to throw a wedding for 20,000 dollars. It really is a very basic wedding planner that has nothing to do with saving any money. The best book you could buy is Bridal Bargins. That book shows how to save money."
1,Out of Date Advise,"This books advise, money saving tips, checklists and frequently asked questions seemed out of date. In these hard economic times the wedding world has change to meet more brides needs, this book contains advise from the past.Check out this just published wedding planning book for Busy Brides today.The Busy Brides Bible for Planning a Fabulous Wedding Without the Expensive Cost of a Wedding Planner"
3,Disappointed,"I, like many brides am on a tight budget and I do not feel this book gave a lot of insight on cutting costs other than to have less guests and to use silk flowers. It is a good refrence though for things to make sure to have lined up for your wedding and to give an idea of the type of person to assign certain jobs to in your wedding."
4,Fast paced and intense,"This fast paced James Rollins style novel features a stoic hero pitted against a seemingly insurmountable foe. Pillars takes it's readers on a global adventure featuring an ancient text and a world wide conspiracy. This book asks us to examine our own strength and perseverance, forcing ourselves to ask the question, ""How hard would we try and just how fast can we run?"""
3,Just didn't have it.,"Overall the book was enjoyable, however the ending just didn't quite seal the deal on the entire novel. Wish it would have because otherwise the book was quite good."
2,Just a toy.,"You get what you pay for. It is not professional looking, more for kids or house decor. It's small and can't replace an actual clap board. I would pay more for something professional if you're really using this for movies. Currently I have it in my room as a decoration."
2,Great Toy,I bought this for my daughter to use as a toy and she loves it. She got a camera for Christmas and wants to be like dad and have a clapper. Don't buy for real productions. It's toy build quality.
2,Poorly designed battery compartment,"The battery compartment is extremely cramped, and the battery contacts look very flimsy. I hope the batteries last long, as I think it will be a struggle to change them. There is a ribbon to help pull out the batteries, but it isn't long enough to be useful."
2,Definitely does not heat well,"After reading all the reviews, I expected this space heater to work like a charm. Not at all. It barely makes the air aournd itself warm. I bought it to heat a medium size room 10x15 warm. My little $7 space heater works better than this one!"
3,no captions,It's a pretty decent b-movie but I just want to point out that contrary to the Product Deatils it does not have captions.
1,So bad that it's good.,"To say that this movie is bad is a gross understatement, but that is exactly what makes it so fun! The plot is very cliche. On a remote planet a colony of humans encounters a mutant creature that stalks them one by one. What makes this movie watchable is the serious nature of it. The actors look in genuine horror at this styrophome mockup of a creature that is controlled by people behind it(almost out of view). There is a good amount of nudity which breaks the otherwise monotonous canned storyline. If you're a fan of cheesy 'B' sci-fi horror movies then you will love this one! It's a RARE find. If you get a copy take care of it because one day you won't be able to get this anywhere."
2,"One, big... glossary.","I saw this book in the library, and I decided to pick it up and leaf through it. It was...dissapointing. I don't know how she made a glossary of pretty basic Wiccan terms into a book, but that's all it is. The info was pretty limited, and it didn't really talk about the religion, rituals, etc. This is something you can find in nearly ever Wicca 101 book in the back, save your money, this just isn't worth it.However, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because this is a great book to give to frinds and family who are curious about Wicca and won't get too freaked out. (Just skip the Skyclad definition) lol"
2,More Wicca stuff we already know,Oh My why didnt someone tell me not to buy this book? It is the same old-same old basic Wicca glossary you find in the back of every book we read.
5,Outstanding Quality,"I was 100% satisfied with this book. It is clearly written, well organized and filled with many usefull examples of both good and bad designs. It also is very well cross referenced to other user interface design resources on every topic. In particular, it contains comprehensive reviews of other usefull books related to user interface design. I rate this as a must-have quality book."
1,VM4500 (SCP-5500) ....IS HORRIBLE!!,"I have had this phone now for a couple of months. The first one was a complete ""lemon"". The second one that Sprint traded for the same one in silver is horrible as well. (Now I dont even have the blue color one!) Numerous dropped calls...I mean NUMEROUS!! Sprint folks reluctantly agree that there is a manufacturing defect with this model phone. So much for the excitement of getting the ""Best"" sprint phone!! Another problem is that you have to repeatedly call them to tell them u r having the problem...and they think you are giving them excuses. They then want to trade you another ""refurb"" phone since you've had it for more then 15 days!! A bunch of ""- - - -""! Anyway...My suggestion...DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!"
3,Nice look; bad reception,"I currently own this phone and I bought it the first week in January because of the sleek design. The phone is physically appealing and has a few nice features. But, thats the only good thing that I saw in this phone-the features-. The reception is terrible and the phone will tell me that it is charging, when of course, it really isn't. This phone also loses signal while all four bar icons are still on the screen. I also have contacted sprint on numerous occasions and I was informed that if I wanted another cellular phone I would have to pay retail value-I already paid retail value for the cellular phone ($411 to be exact)-. We must remember that the main reason that we buy cell phones are for calling purposes, then the features the phone has to offer. I give the features a 5 out of 5 but the actual phone and its reception, I give it a 1 out of 5."
2,"Phone Okay, Sprint Not and Combined No Good.","The phone is okay, but for the price it is not. Many phones now a days have similiar feature to this Sanyo VM4500, but alot cheaper with better carriers. My experience with sprint has been terrible. Even with their new investment of improving their network and service, it is pretty much still no good. You hear hissing in the background and the connectivity bars are all misleading. You can have 4 bars and still have it ""digitally roam"" and the dropped calls are just annoying. I think it's always better to go with Verizon.- tech saavy a.j."
2,Great Until You Get to the Camera,"This phone has a lot of great features, and a lot of rave reviews. It was my top choice for a new phone...until I tried it in the store. There it took FIVE SECONDS from when you hit the button, while in camera mode, to when it actually could be bothered to take the picture. At which point, if you've moved the phone to try to figure out what's wrong, or your subject has moved, or the funny thing you were trying to capture, you now have a nice shot of the ground.Some people may not mind that, or may just accept it, especially with all the other great features, but it would drive me insane. Instead try out Toshiba's VM4050, with essentially the same features but the best picture quality, best screen quality, and it takes pictures instantly, even in motion. Or the Samsung VM-A680, which is only slightly slower than the Toshiba, and just lacks speakerphone. (Everyone keeps talking about speakerphone, but really, who needs it? I know I don't.)"
2,"Okay story, awful proofreading","Shelly Reuben should sue Harcourt, they did such a lousy job with her book. Although her plotting and characterization are no great shakes, I would have found the book a moderately enjoyable read. EXCEPT for the inexcusable spelling mistakes it was riddled with. Actually, many of the mistakes weren't really in spelling but in confusing a word with a similar one. In other words, more ignorance than misspelling. Croquette instead of croquet, overhaul for overall (as in ""the overhaul condition""), internment for interment, unphased for unfazed, premier instead of premiere - on and on, a seemingly endless list. The publisher is supposed to catch these mistakes, not leave them intact to expose the author's shaky grasp on words. I found it extremely distracting, and the combination of so-so writing with really bad proofing means I certainly won't buy another of her books."
3,"Fun to display, not to play","I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. I wouldn't recommend buying this as a toy for a child, but it did provide a day or two of comedy for my 27 year old boyfriend and his friends."
5,I HAVE THIS BOOK,"IF YOU ARE A SELENA FAN AND YOU DON,T OWN THIS BOOK YOU SHOULD BUY IT BECAUSE I HAVE IT AND I LOVE IT IT HAS PLENTY OF PICTURES OF HER IN THE BOOK AND I WANT TO TO TELL HER FANS THAT THERE IS A PICTURE OF HER IN HER CASKET IN THE BOOK PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK ANY SELENA FAN THROUGH OUT THE WORLD SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This book tells very little about selena. It is mostly about the history of Tejano music and is very repetitive. I was hoping for details about her life and usually the books about a persons life are better than the movie but in this case the opposite is true. Don't waste your money!!
5,One of the best book about cointegration test,"The book of Wojciech W. Charemza and D. F. Deadman is one of the best book about Contegration test, it's very easy. This book: ""New Directions in Econometric Practice : General to Specific Modelling, Cointegration, and Vector autoregression"" is meant to be used as a text, not read as a reference."
1,This heater is dangerious,I bought this heater in November 2007 I used it all last winter and was using it in my livingroom recently and sitting with my back to it on my computer and I smelled an odor like something was burning it was that Soleous heater it was smoking and almost caught on fire but blew the electric breaker(thank goodness) it could have caught my apartment on fire! I will never buy a radiant heater again!!!
3,Buying this one. Again.,"I really like this and my cats absolutely love it. I end up with a string of cats littering the floor in the direction that this is pointing. If you're pointing the (very bright) thing at yourself, you get nice and toasty (5 stars for toasty and energy efficiency), however this unit did not do a great job of heating the whole room unless I left it on for a very long time (3 stars for heating a whole room). Last of all, I'm buying a second one because my first one kicked itself off and won't go on again. It's about two years old which isn't so bad but I do like things that last (3 stars for staying power)."
4,very warm and efficient,"Overall this is a good product considering its low cost. It gives immediate warmth and uses less energy than other space heaters. It is very bright though, I use the low setting to reduce light."
2,Lame,Predictably lame horror exploitation flick. Not even T & A can bring this to mediocre at best. Filmed on location in England.
5,Indispensible Guide to Tchaikovsky's Song,"This book is a godsend to English speakers who wish to perform Tchaikovsky's songs. It gives useful background to each and every song and provides transliterations that are idiomatically accurate, without the literal schoolboy howlers that one finds on some other sites. The translations are very well done. The texts in both languages are very clear and anyone wishing to perform any song can immediately feel the spirit of the poet and decide whether the song is suitable for him or her. A considerable bonus is the listing of all who have recorded each song, for this enables those interested to establish easily whether the song is appropriate for a male singer, or a female singer, or both. The only fault is that the Russian headings at the top of each song are in modified cursive script, which is, of course, rather different from printed script and is somewhat confusing for the letters ""t"" and ""ee"". This is a superb book and I wish that I had had it years ago."
1,Incomplete,"It came with only the davinci tool (by far the cheapest of the two) and I had to return it for a full refund. Amazon could not send the other part, so I ended up having to wait some time for the refund."
2,scroll button needs a lot of work,"This mouse looks cool and it performs well in every area but one: scrolling. The wheel-less button is very difficult to control with any precision and it requires a suprising amount of pressure to activate. If you don't do a lot of scrolling then I'd recommend this mouse, but if this is a feature you use repeatedly then I'd give it a pass and wait for Kensington to come up with a better scrolling button."
3,"Good book, but contains very little from Sri Aurobindo","This is a nice little book. It contains quite a bit of good information, and some powerful insights on the potential of the human mind and consciousness. However, the statement on the cover makes it sound as if it might be at least close to a 50/50 balance of excerpts from the work of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. This is not the case at all. The content of the book consists of probably 90% plus of commentary from The Mother. There are only a few tidbits from Sri Aurobindo. While much of what The Mother has to say is useful and sometimes even quite advanced and even extraordinary, I bought this book because I wanted to delve into the wisdom of Sri Aurobindo. If that is what you seek, try a different title. Very, very few of his insights are included here. Still a good book to read and still a good book to have in one's collection of enlightening and uplifting and also transformative literature."
2,He loses me!,"I agree with the other review-----wish I had sent mine back too. I love the first part --- watching him dance with a few students, and the routine they do is very good, but as it goes into Charles teaching the steps, forget it! You watch him from the back, and he makes it so complicated. I tried several times, then just got frustrated, and I am not a beginner in tap! He MUST be better in a live class, because the tape was a waste of money for me. Sorry! I wanted to like it, and learn from him."
5,Awesome!!,Love this stuff!! Now my dog just needs to quit chewing through it!!! Thanks for making a great product that is environmentally responsible.
5,Great Quality,Very good quality and I love the fleece lining on the handle. Super thick and hopefully will last a long time.
3,OK,"Kathryn Harrison is one of my favorite writers, but of all her five books this is the worst. In substance it is nearly identical to ""The Kiss"", which is a superior piece of work."
2,Not the best street racing game!,L.A. Rush is the worst street racing game ever!The choices available to you are bad!You're going to regret getting this game!
1,Didnt even work,"My little guy was highly dissapointed, the game did not even work. He had even spent his allowance on it :("
1,Not Original Artists,"If you were expecting this to be a compilation of your favorite sports jams sung in the way that made them popular, don't order this CD. Although the artists try to sound ""just like"" the real thing, it's like watching your Mom try to dance to your music -- even if she's good, it's just not right. Unfortunately, the description doesn't tell you it's not by the original artists, and since I don't have a sound card at work, I didn't listen to the cuts. Never again."
1,Big waste of money,The cover can fool you. It looks like a really cool game but it has terrible graphics and awfull controls. It's slow and doesn't offer many tracks and only two bikes. It doesn't even give you a Yamaha like Jeremy rides. I hope the 2000 version is a little better. Try Moto Racer 2.
2,save your money,"i was very disappointed with this book. i excepted so much because of the hype. there are much better bio's of jackie, such as 'just jackie' and 'jackie after jack'. america's queen is filled with inaccuracies, her age at the time of jfk's death, and even her new york address, the book states it as 1040 park ave, when it was actually 1040 5th ave. save your money on this one and get the other bio's."
2,Disappointing but still has some good,"i was disappointed to read the english translation of a number of these proverbs. with the amount of italian i know, i felt that some of the phrases didn't capture what was meant nor was a true translation. I felt that they could have at least related some of them to english equivalent proverbs. i have had friends that are fluent in the language and who have lived in italy to read thru the book and they laughed at some of them and told me what the translation is--which in some cases very different from what was printed. overall, i appreciate the effort. it was more important for me to at least have a set of ""proverbs"" to read in italian. i will make the translation of them on my own. unfortunately, i cannot recommend this book."
3,great movies,"I like the movies of the golden time, though unfortunately they are not well re-mastered."
3,"Should Read, ""A Brief History of Cryptography""","Overall, this book is a short and easy read, but falls short of the title: ""A Brief History of Cryptology"".Perhaps fearing inadvertently stating some piece of classified data, the author has chosen to focus on the cryptography vice cryptology. Cryptology is the combination of cryptography (making codes) and cryptoanalysis (breaking codes).Indeed, this book is more of an analysis over the combination of advanced mathematics, communications theory, and networking in the development of modern secure communications.This reviewer recommends ""The Codebreakers"" as a far better substitute."
2,"Too Big, Too Many!","This product might work for some, but not for me. I have been taking biotin for years, and I thought to make a switch. I think I will just stick with my high potency biotin pill. I didn't read close enough I guess, but these are fairly large capsules. They smell bad, and are not that easy to swallow. On top of that you need to take 4 a day! That is a lot in my opinion. Not worth it."
3,Not sure yet,I am on my 3rd month of using the product. I had stopped losing my hair in the second month but this month a little more noticeable hair loss. Probably stress. I will continue using for now. I think my overall hair condition is better....I hope :)
2,off by 10 degrees,"bought for my car exterior (stuck on rear view mirror on passenger side). when you know that in the shade, it's off by 10 degrees, you can guesstimate the temp. it was so cheap i shouldn't have expected more."
3,Collection,"Lorrie Morgan has one of the most distinct voices in country music. She can sing anything, a heartfelt ballad, a kick up your shoes and dance song, or whatever. The Essential series runs among many artists, who belong to the RCA recording group. The problem that runs in many cases is the artist has too many hits, and there is not enough space so only certain songs make the collection. This is the case with The Essential Lorrie Morgan, it is a great collection of some of her songs, but where are the others? There certainly is plenty of room for more material. However, not to say this album is useless, it has some of her hits. I suggest this to fans of Morgan, or people who are interested in trying new music."
2,Difficult and not so great results,"We purchased the scanner with expectations of converting our old slides. The scanner was difficult to start up, even following the directions did not work and we had to improvise, but we started the process an hr1 1/2 later. The software it came with is not user friendly. It is difficult to get the results you want. We tried scanning several ways and about 1 out of three slides would have a black line through them. The scanner also has a flaw that it has an open window where dust falls into and the dust comes through on the slides. I had to use a cotton swab to clean it several times throughout the scanning. The scanning time is also about 5-7 minutes for one slide, on it's highest resolution, which is really the only somewhat acceptable picture. After trying several hundred scans I am taking it back. My husband and I are both tech savy and this scanner is just a frustration."
5,great book for Big 12 reference AND MORE,"What a great book for those who follow football AND their loved ones who travel with them. Although I bought the book formy Big 12 football fan, I soon found myself eager to accompany him on his next trip just to explore some of the sites listed. The book provided us with tons of helpful, insider hints for game days AND it also gave me information and ideas for side trips before and after (and sometimes during!) the games. We highly recommend this book and plan to give it to several of our Big 12 friends as a ""season opener"" present."
4,Scholar line perfect for school,"We have found these pencils to be the perfect fit for our homeschool art needs. The colors are true, the colored cores are smooth (in contrast to the mass market brands that have hard chunks in them) and they hold up quite well. The price point makes them even more attractive as finding smooth art pencils for school needs is hard to do on a budget.The only breakage we have experienced in the years that we have been using the Prismacolor Scholar Colored Pencils is when the box has been dropped (usually on a hard floor) as that breaks the colored core into little pieces in the wood casing, making the pencils useless."
4,Above average review text for self defense,"I teach Kenpo Karate and have been active in Kenpo for over 26 yrs. The text by Joan Nelson is an excellent reference source for the lay public on self defense, but an invaluable tool for professional self defense instructors of most styles."
1,Damaged in shipment,"Never had a chance to use the unit. It was a great deal through Warehousedeals but UPS drive comes in with it and I look at him and he looks at me and expected me to sign for the unit. Box was almost black from dirt, unit was not secure inside at all and, box was open at top with some make shift re-tape thrown in. Back of unit where heat grill is was ripped of it's back. Not to mention the gigantic dent on both sides and rear.You really need to be careful with heavy items from Amazon. Especially Warehousedeals. There were no more available to receive so this unit went back. I am not even sure if Amazon is to blame or 3rd party in this case. Since Amazon is good with customer service and returns, for me it was worth the chance on this and in the future using Amazon Warehousedeals."
1,Weak,"I bought this to use with a brush on 100 lb smooth bristol. When used with a brush it dries gray. Not super black at all. I thought that maybe I had not shook the bottle enough, but even after shaking and stirring- the results were same; disappointing.If you brush over a line made with a pen or marker, you could easily see the line once the ink dried."
4,This product is fine,upon receiving product it was damaged but customer service remedied the issue and sent out a replacement overnight.Great customer service. Accidents happen
2,What is the deal with the sound?,"The information contained in this DVD is good overall; however the production is terrible, at times it has the sound quality of a porno-very distracting, and unpleasant. The menu is also cumbersome. There are better choices for the beginner."
1,"Wildly inaccurate, avoid it","The calibration is off by a wild margin. I used this wrench it to install a cylinder head, and ended up almost blowing the engine. It was showing 11 ft lbs, but when I checked with another torque wrench, the torque was 16 ft lbs. I thought it is due to the torque being in the low range (this wrench is rated up to 80 ft lbs) so I gave it another chance. I used it to tighten a flywheel nut spec'ed at 33 ft lbs. I never got this wrench to click, while I tightened the nut almost as tight as I got it with an impact wrench! Bottom line: do not use this wrench if the job requires any accuracy at all!"
4,"A little tight on the higher range, but worked.",I wanted to be sure that the O2 sensor was tightened properly and it did the job. It will come in handy for other service jobs I plan for the future. I didn't have the issue the identifier marks being off as others stated. I have used it on oil and tire changes without issue. I will be doing plugs later and plan on using it then too. It stores nicely in the tool box in the supplied case.
4,A most excellent CD for relaxing and chilling out...,"John Huling only gets four stars here because I have to reserve five stars for Return to Spiritlands, which somehow is even better. John captures nature through inspiring music. The flute is every bit as good as Paul Horn or R. Carlos Nakai. John, more please!"
2,Yet Another Oakland Group...,"There is absolutely nothing spectacular about this cd. The only good songs, ""Phone Check"" and ""Twos and Fews"" are decent only because Richie Rich helps them out, but the rest of the CD sounds like another lame attempt by yet another Oakland group trying to make some money. It was especially disappointing that Rame Royal, who was exceptional on Rich's ""Pillow"", delivers such simple lyrics. On this LP, ""Yahighness"" deserves to be dethroned. The guest appearances, especially on ""Oakland's in the House"" and ""Get Served"" prevent this from being a one star rating, but two stars is hardly admirable. Hopefully, the sophomore effort will display a little more creativity and depth. Finally, ""Mr. Mobile Phone Man"", a cheesy steal from New Edition's ""Mr. Telephone Man"", and ""Old School Skit"" illustrate that even their interludes need more work."
5,Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn witness a murder done by Injun Joe.,"I liked this book because the life that Tom and Huck had was just awesome because the adventures they had. What also was cool about their life was that every kid looked up to them, they lived on the wild side, had adventures using their imagination, and did some hilarious things like attending their own funiral. When I read this book, it reallyamazed me and made me want to read the next book, The Adventures of Huck Finn."
5,it's fantastic!,"i played it one evening while visiting friends and had a wonderful time. fluxx was also recommended, however i hadn't played it yet.weeks passed and i was still thinking about how fun and inventive aquarius had been, SO, i purchased both on whim one morning.two weeks later i was ordering two more looney labs games, chrononaughts and the village.so, two thumbs up, for sure. i'll be ordering copies for my friends and family, no doubt. wonderful gift idea."
4,Works Great,"I struggled with those cheap cardboard and ""foil"" heat shields and finally decided to get something that is made to fit. This fits great, is eash to put up and does not need anything but the visors to keep it in place."
3,works when you have time...,I am normally always in a hurry and this shade is not the easiest to put in the windshield..partically in my small Camero
1,what me worry?,"from the recent report of the National Academy of Science Committee on Climate Change: ""Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are expected to continue through the 21st century.""from the same report:""Some models project an increased tendency toward drought over semi-arid regions, such as the U.S. Great Plains. Hydrologic impacts could be significant over the western United States,where much of the water supply is dependent on the amount of snow pack and the timing of the spring runoff.""but don't worry! be happy!"
3,Nice Novel,"A good read if abit raw, reads like a first novel, alot of the story is politcally motivated with backstory that is never really explained. While a good and interesting read, it lacks the depth and absorbtion that comes of a truly amazing novel. Still not bad, would recomend."
5,For lovers of Reger and Late Romantic Choral Music,"Reger wrote the Latin Requiem in 1914 in remembrance of soldiers fallen in the 1st World War - but after completing approx 30 minutes of music, was talked out of completing it by a well meaning but entirely misguided musical associate. What remains is a massive, dense, hugely impressive torso of highly chromatic, late Romantic choral/soloists/orchestral music of the first order. Highly recommended."
5,"Excelent explanation of spreading, modulation and more","This book is a very complete explanation of spread spectrum technics. The book is centered in IS-95 standard, but the detail in every subject makes it useful for other standards, like WCDMA and CDMA2000. After reading this book i feel that i can handle any spreading and codification technic. To get 3G to the real world, we need to handle the most inner principles of technology. With this book we have and excelent presentation of this principles, for the present and the future."
4,I have no idea,"It goes on well, very smooth. Seems to work OK. The smell is very unpleasant. Smells like liquefied kitty litter."
5,Easter Basket (Razzle Dazzle Books),My daughter was six months old when she received this book as a gift from Grandma. It really is a great book for a baby because the colors are so vivid. She turns through the pages over and over again. (All of the razzle dazzle books are excellent).
3,Too sweet-tasting and a bit clumpy.,"Overall a nice wake-me-up. Still has 65 calories per serving. A little too sweet tasting and not enough spice flavor. If I make it to taste spice, then it is simply too sweet. Doesn't dissolve completely...leaves clumps floating that are sticky. But no hydrogenated oils!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,ALL I CAN SAY WAS I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS. THIS C.D WAS TERRIBLE! A WASTE OF $$ & TIME! MY ADVICE... DO NOT BUY!
1,DON'T BUY,if you are a true house music and dance fan you won't like this... just turn on the radio and you'll hear the same played out songs.
3,The movie sells the book - it should be the other way around,"Very surfacey, pulpy book that reinforces again and again and again and again that the 3 boy characters (yes later men friends as well) grow up together, live together, sort of love together, are sexually and spiritually abused in reform school toegether, mature in different directions (together). ...no surprises, drama, or interest for me. Why is it a bestseller? I could put it down. In fact I had a hard time reading it thru to the end"
5,Sleepers showed me parts of my soul that I never knew I had,"I would just like Mr Carcaterra to know just how much this story inspired me to use my negative experiences to educat and inform others about the harsh realities of life. I have always been an avidwriter, despite my age of 15, and whenever I feel like its no longer worth it, I just pick up sleepers and the minute I finish it, I'm back in front of the computer screen. This book showed compassion yet hatred, close friendship yet the loneliness of torture and those who build a barrier around them to protect themselves from others. Since the day I picked up a copy of this book at a booksale and thought; ""I might as well get this one,"" I always have and always will own a copy of and consider this book to be the greatest on Earth- a compelling story of love and hate, friendship and happiness- if you havent already, you must read this book; youll remember it forever, no doubt."
2,"Hit me over the head gently, please","The topic of boys abused in a reform school holds much potential. Though the events Carcaterra described sounded horrific, I found it difficult to empathize. Carcaterra failed to give me any reason to like the main characters in this book - four boys whose mischevious, frequently NASTY, actions he excuses away with the poor and turbulent environment of their Hell's Kitchen residency. The writing is labored and numbing in its repetition. A good book shows; a poor book tells. Carcaterra tells the reader what to think and overanalyzes every plot detail ad nauseum instead of letting the reader come to his or her own conclusions. Trash deserving of its placement on supermarket aisles"
3,"A compelling read, but not worth the hype","I read this book when it first came out and admit that it is a compelling story. THe ease however with which this book was made into an equally compelling movie made me realize that it is a very shallow story. You just cannot translate good books into good movies all that often. It also casts doubt on the authors integrity and that of the story, which is he main reason many of us read it i n the first place. I am sure this kind of abuse continues to happen in many juvenile facilities, but the courtroom scenes that followed were sheer baloney. If you read this book as pure fiction, you will be entertained at the very least, but to read more into it than that is to fall victim to the calculations of its author. No doubt we will see a sequel, proving that you can fool some of the people all of the time."
1,i don't think so,As a piece of fiction I would have given this book a higher score but it is supposedly a true story and I'm not buying that for a minute. Everything worked out too pat to be true. I was very happy to learn that others had questioned the book's authenticity. I know an author takes artistic license on some things when writing a book and that is fine. Those authors are up front with it in a statement telling the reader so. Carcaterra crossed the line by saying the story was true. He could have said it was an extrapolation of his childhood experiences or said it was based loosely on his own personal experiences and that would have been fine with me.
2,Sorry folks--I ain't buyin' it,"Without knowing that there had ever been a controvery about this book's credulity, I skimmed through the online reviews here to see if anyone found this book as unbelieveable as I did. This story is absolutely preposterous! Not only that, but it's downright corny. I'll try not to give any of the plot away, but am I really supposed to believe that court scene? These types of things just don't happen folks. It's laughable, actually.I agree with the one person online here who said that, with this book, perhaps the author is exacting a revenge that he WISH could have happened. There's just a dripping sentimentality throughout the whole story that reeks of fabrication. By saying that the story is true, Carcaterra drew a lot of attention to himself and the book. Had it been positioned for what it is--fiction--it would have sunk like a dead guy in cement shoes."
4,A powerful work of fiction?,"A powerful writer and a truly compelling story based on events that may never have actually occured.Questions have arisen to its authenticity. These questions resulted in an investigation by Channel 7 Eyewitness News in New York (WABC TV) around the time the film was released and after an inviestigation was opened by the Archdiocese of New York. No record of a victim, no records in the courts, no coverage in the media of such a powerful case tried by such a young, dynamic lawyer and a much different story on the boys lives from the priest involved. Names were changed but all parties involved were fairly easy for Eyewitness News to track down after looking into the authors past.The result is a powerful book written by a former journalist who may have been too insecure to sell his first novel as a work of fiction or to let it stand on its own merits -- a frailty of a number of journalists in recent months.A good read but take it all with a grain of salt."
1,Poor quality,Used this scissors for almost a month. Last week I noticed rust on the edges and on the handle. I decided to through them since I did not like the idea of eating a dose of rust with my food!It cuts (as expected) no complains there. If you keep it dry it may still a good bargain for the price.
1,Prepare to cut yourself,"These scissors are great if you don't mind the blades separating while you use them and having the blades fall like knives toward your feet. Any time you open these up to get a nice fresh cut into something, you run a high risk of the blades coming apart. I wish there was a lock on them. I'm no chef, and maybe people find that extra cut-out in the blade good for cutting bone or whatever, but it makes cutting anything else impossible. Plus, is it really that handy to have a bottle opener on the back? Really? Seems a little dumb."
5,These scissors are the best.,"I LOVE these scissors. They come apart for easy cleaning, I can cut meat up and wash them thoroughly and get all the gunk out. The red handle is only now showing wear and tear after years of handling and abuse. But the metal itself is still holding up strong and I intend to get another set if this one should completely give out. It cuts through anything, is easy to clean, easy to handle and absolutely affordable. Will buy again!"
2,plastic part of the handle chipped off and then just fell off the metal frame,I'm in danger of stabbing my hand everytime I grip these scissors so they need to be chucked. I loved the pull apartability of these shears and that it is an American company. It's important to sanitize after cutting chicken into parts and only pull apart shears ensures that you get the entire surface.
4,"Nice product, nice scent","I ordered this based on a recommendation from a friend. She uses this scent but could not remember the exact product. I took a chance and guessed perhaps it was this one. It wasn't. I am still on the hunt to find exactly what she was using and she can't remember. That said, this one is very nice. It's everything it is advertised to be. Citrusy and long-lasting. I do recommend it!"
3,"Too much orange scent, not much patchouli","I ordered this for the patchouli scent, but the orange scent is very overwhelming. It smells ok, but not what I expected. As far as moisturizing, it is a wonderful lotion that absorbs well, not greasy."
5,Bob's Red Mill Flax Seed - Excellent buy,"Until recently a local health & nutrition store carried Bob's Red Mill products, no one else has it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and even happier when I saw the price. It is much less expensive to order through Amazon, and even fresher than buying in a store.All of Bob's Red Mill products are of high quality and very fresh. An excellent company to buy organic products from!"
3,Organic means straight from the field...,Found the item filled with inedible gritty stuff. Took alot of time to sift through to remove impurities. Would not buy again.
2,Disappointed by the book,"I bought this book expecting to hear some scientific research as to why black athletes dominate sports and whether there is any statistically significant data proving the point or not. Although there are few pieces of macro scientific information included, I learned nothing new. There was virtually no data comparing similar white and black athletes on reaction time, vertical leaping distance, 100 meter dash times etc.I also expected to see some data comparing anthropometric differences that may explain better athletic performance, such as the average thigh length or ratio of thigh length to lower leg length.The book is devoted 90% to the ""why we're afraid to talk about it"" aspects, that is, the political correctness issue in talking about racial differences. Frankly, this was not why I bought the book so I was mostly disappointed."
2,Surprisingly short on substance,"There is some interesting information here, but ultimately much of this book is simply a history of African-American athletics, which is not exactly obvious from the book's title. Hey, I'm as interested in the story of Jack Johnson as the next guy, but does the treatment he received really belong in this book? Given that the book weighs in at 400 pages, you've got to wonder what his editor was thinking about some of these anecdotes.On another note, I'm tired of seeing Tiger Woods be referred to as a ""black golfer."" For the record, Tiger is 1/2 Asian, 1/4 black, 1/8 white and 1/8 Native American. Why does his black ancestry somehow trump the other 75% of his heritage?"
3,pretty good,i just got this game and it seems to be like a midnight club type of game.its pretty good. it doesnt have very good graphics.its not the best game ive ever had.
1,What?,Racing?Just racing?I was hoping for better games of the Late 90's like Carnevil or MK4 or Artic Thunder and not this crap like Badlands or whatever.The only good game is Hydro Thunder.I only had to look at the game to see how bad it was.Did not buy it.
1,Bad Baseball Game,THis Game is basically like evry other but is poorly designed especially when batting they design it in a way where when you are batting it is also impossible to hit the ball. besides that the graphics aren't too good. if you want to buy a baseball game choose something else
5,An inspiring book that helps you get back on track,"Dr. Bellamy has provided some valuable secrets we need to have a vision and achieve your dreams. I found this book to be both inspiring and informative. At some point in our lives we all get off track. We get confused and uncertain how to get out of a rut. Now we have another timely resource for ourselves, family members, and friends to use to change our unwanted situation."
4,Good read,"I bought this book for a grad class I was taking and found that I learned more from reading the book than from the class! I actually have it sitting by my desk at work since it's an easy reference to various ""rules"" within PR."
5,Fast Delivery,I was very pleased with the quickness of delivery. The book arrived a couple days after I place the order. It was in good condition as described on line.
2,"Beautiful pendant, needs better clasp","It was beautiful in the that week we had it. Unfortunately the clasp didn't hold and now it's gone. Have another letter which is fine, maybe we just got a dud or maybe it's a problem with the K."
4,Fun for a round or two.,"I had been searching high and low for this game after having played it years ago at a friend's house. I finally found it on Amazon.com, so you can literally find anything to buy on their site!True Colors was a lot of fun for a round or two. I couldn't play it all night or anything like Yahtzee! It's fun to see how your friends perceive you. The questions are mostly good but some do throw you for a loop!I'd say it's good game to start with if you're having game night but you should have a back up game that is a little more involved if you're looking to play games for hours."
4,Nice.,"These discs are actually very good. Besides Mussorgsky's famous ""Pictures"" and ""Bald Mountain,"" the Overture to ""Khovanschina"" is featured, along with excerpts from ""Boris Gudonov."" Also, Mussorgsky's six songs, ""Night,"" ""The Ragamuffin,"" ""Where Art Thou, Little Star,"" ""The Magpie,"" and ""On the Dneiper,"" are by turns playful and touching. One of the only problems I find with these recordings is Sviatslav Richter's performance of ""Pictures"" (The orchestral version is also featured.) Richter purposely makes mistakes and glitches in his playing so as not to appear a ""conformist."" Although his intentions are commendable, the glitches in the piece stand out. Also, the recording of Richter's version is rough, accompanied by fairly frequent coughs from the audience. However, it is easy to look past this, and the extraordinary aspects of these pieces can be appreciated."
4,Sanity and insanity: two sides of the same coin!,"Eliseo Subela built a very schocking script around a supposed alien that suddenly in a Hospital for insanes in Bueno Aires.His presence brings about curiosity around the Doctor who examines him. The first half is really intriguing, but the script lacks its dramatic punch once we capture the message in the bottle.Good but not great film that nevertheless deserves your attention."
3,"not bad first half, then downhill into childish polemics","...culminates in an awkward, tries-too-hard-to-be-Michael-Moore interview with a Christian school principal, capped off with the director breathlessly announcing to the camera that he no longer believes in the existence of the Holy Spirit.Too bad, because this film could've been so much better in raising public awareness of the Bible's numberless textual/historical issues. The first 30 minutes were often quite amusing and interesting, though what pretense of objectivity there was quickly wore thin. Maybe if the director were to come back in about 20 years after growing up more, he could remake this film and finally do it right."
3,"Many valid points, but lots of repetition.","The film maker made lots of valid points, his longer interviews with a Berkeley professor and the head of the Christian academy where he was schooled were particularly interesting. But, there is too much repetition of scenes and parts of interviews."
2,"Interesting, but amateurish.","I found this documentary lacking any real depth of research. The Christian interviews were weakly orchestrated, and Flemming seems more interested in ""sticking it"" to his former place of religious indoctrination, the Christian Village Schools in California. Also touting that Richard Dawkins is included in the film, I found that the well-known athiest is only produced as a recorded telephone interview, a secondary portion within the commentary features.While I believe his intentions were sincere, Flemming missed his mark in creating a convincing argument denouncing Christianity."
2,"Occasionally interesting, mostly just bad","I was seriously disappointed by this documentary. The production was shoddy and frequently annoying, with random background music that seemed to have no bearing on the topic at hand. The graphics were amateurish at best.As far as the content goes, many of the experts had interesting things to say. The narrator unfortunately did a disservice to the film by trying too hard to make it personal. He really did not seem to be after an objective, honest discussion, but rather seemed to be on a personal crusade to discredit Christianity, with tactics that came across as openly dishonest in places.Avoid this drivel. If you want a far superior documentary on a related subject, seeJudgment Day - Intelligent Design on TrialFor what it's worth, I'm an atheist."
2,"Interesting, but not very well done","As a documentary, this film isn't very well put together. It drifts here and there, and doesn't really have a focus. Sure, he lays out the evidence that raises doubts about the validity of scripture, but does it in an inconsistent and sometimes bewildering way, making it hard to follow at times. For example, it takes about two-thirds of the way through the film until Flemming reveals that he used to be a evangelical.Now, just to go on record, I am an athiest too and quite a staunch one, and I am not panning this movie because of its content. I think there should be many more documentaries critical of religion (and Christianity in particular), but this one fails to impress."
3,Eternity abstract in the post-mortem existence,"What is a point to discuss obvious?From the dawn of the history recorded religious segregations are rather a way to survive than being awarded eternity abstract in the post-mortem existence.Itself, this work brings about some information to people remote geographically from a Christian world. But would they have an access to this DVD???"
1,Is that it?,"Being a Christian, I sat down with this movie hoping for some thought provoking ideas, and maybe some debatable issues to chew over afterwards. I was severely let down.Flemmings from the start pits a bunch of sweet, not so intelligent, unknowing fund-Christians against some tough-edge scholars. It's like watching a chicken eat a worm.Even so the holes in his argument as so big, I began to lose interest in even attempting to rebuke his ideas.Anyone who has sat through a collegiate level Bible course can quickly disassemble his arguments, note his misuse of scripture, and quite nearly laugh at the length he took to portray Christians as complete lunatics.This film is so easy to rebuke, I can't see any reason in even trying to do so. It practically proves itself wrong.Honestly, Charles Manson? Since when was he a symbol of Christian leadership?There have been many films and books that have challenged the Christian belief system; this documentary is not one of them.Don't waste your time."
5,A movie for/to understand apostate Christians.,"As a former conservative Christian, people often ask me how/why I changed to atheist. This movie does a fantastic job outlining why many of us did it. For people like me, it was entertaining and validating. We need more movies like this. Christians need to watch this."
2,Nothing new,"I have read a fair amount on atheist literature and found very little new material in this film. What prompted me to buy this were the debates on youtube between Sam Harris and various fundamentalists which I found very interesting, but I was disappointed that Harris' commentary in the film was not as insightful as other things I've heard him say. The documentary is filmed in a somewhat old school way that was slightly bothersome and the narrators voice is pretty monotonous which was a let down. Also, the documentary portion of the film is less than an hour long, which surprised me because the I had read the DVD has 5 hours of footage. I realized that the amount of information an hour long documentary can include is very limited compared to a book on this subject, so you're probably better off with the latter option if you want to learn something. However, if you haven't read much on the arguments against god then you might find some new tid bits."
2,disappointing documentary,"I was looking forward to an entertaining and instructional documentary and it was to some degree. The documentary was factual regarding religion and the bible, but I felt Brian Flemming made a few segments too personal. Further, many of the jokes went overboard and would make most people cringe. I did like the interviews, especially those with Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins."
5,Awesome movie.,"This movie is a basic in understanding the history of the bible, but it also contains the contradictions that some believers and teachers have."
3,Not worth $20,"I rented this video and I have to say that the material they did have was pretty good. However, it turned out to be just over an hour long, not long enough. It had more of a college project feel than a real documentary."
1,The documentary that wasn't there,"As an atheist, I was embarrassed by this 'documentary.' He resorts to clips of bad vintage movies about Jesus, which seemed a feeble attempt to make Christianity look foolish just by association. Later he tried to frame an argument against Christianity based on the fact that Mel Gibson's bloody portrayal of the crucifixion is the most popular Jesus movie ever. Whatever valid points he had were lost in our laughter at his juvenile technique."
4,Undiagnoses peculiarities,"Up until recently I didn't know ADD was part of my personal story. It though it was an issue for young boys living solely on a sugar diet. This book helped me see that other people share the same challenges in marriage and at work as I do and that there is hope for ADD folks like me. Dr. Rick Fowler provides useful suggestions to spouses and parents dealing with an ADD/ADHD spouse or child. Especially helpful are the tips for ADD people on how to modify behavior, structure daily activities and nurture stable relationships. Thank you Dr. Fowler for your insights and honesty about life with ADD people."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I am one that loves to look at other teachers' classrooms for new and creative ideas. I thought that is what I would be getting from this book. However, I found this book to be full of cluttery classrooms and old ideas. I am very disappointed with the book."
1,What a joke!,"This has to be the poorest quality resource book I have ever seen. The other reviewers are obviously related to the author. Shame on you Scholastic for putting out such a low quality book. Call me, and I will let you take pictures of my room. I promise costumers will walk away much more satisfied. I've seen better ideas surfing the net, FOR FREE! One picture was of a classroom with a piano (this was a regular classroom and not a music room). A PIANO???? Absolutely ridiculous! Finally, the rooms were OLD and filthy. Save your money!"
4,Not the usual teen movie,"Jennifer's Body is a twist on the usual teen scary movie. Very well-written dialogue by Diablo Cody (Juno). Twists you don't see coming, and an odd best-friends relationship. Amanda Seyfried is amazing in her role, actually carrying the movie way beyond her best friend. Of course, Megan Fox is a fox, scary and all. Fun to see the ending, beyond the credits. Watch it a second time with captioning to catch all the clever dialogue."
1,Jennifer Spews,"Ok, every once in a while I like to watch a teen-horror movie. ""Zombie Land"" Rocks! Zombie Land was fun and educational, well if you ever find yourself in Zombie land. However Jennifer's Body sucks for this reason. Ok, if you're going to bring religion into a supernatural demon satan horror movie, and as a side note, discredit Christianity with ""they said I should except Jesus into my heart...but it didn't work""...(Jesus the Christ who historically did a lot of demon butt kicking...not to mention satan) and then have the possessed girl (Megan Fox) ""transfer demon power"" to her best friend...well the story line becomes ignorant...like Miss Fox's statements last year."
4,"Very Campy, but Very Cool!","I watched this with my sister and my brother-in-law one day when i spent the night over there. At first, i really did not think it was gonna be that great, but i was dead wrong. This IS a really GOOD movie in my opinion. I think that, for a teen-horror film, they injected way too much humor into it. But hey, it was scary and funny LOL. The only part of the film that I honestly didn't like is when the goth and/or emo kid gets killed. I really did not want him to die. Other than that this was a scary, campy, funny, and amazing little film!"
5,Very Good,The product was delivered on time and was in the specified condition. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Hard to clean. Should be called brittle filter.,"Tried to clean it before first use, and I was unable to remove reservoir without breaking it. Manual does not tell you how to accomplish this feat. Very disappointing."
4,"Good book, bad movie","It's unfortunate that the cover art was redone by MTV as a movie tie-in because this book has nothing to do with the movie of the same name. No offense to Charlize Theron, but the original Aeon is the topic of this book. As an insane Peter Chung fan, I had to have it but anyone interested in material resulting from this movie should probably pick up the recent Aeon Flux graphic novel instead if they liked the movie."
1,Worst DVD set EVER!!!!,"This is the sloppiest, worst thought out attempt to steal money from Friday fans paramount has come up with. After spending 25 bux a pop on bare bones, terrible transfer DVD's, we get this ""special box set"" With NO real features besides the audio commentaries...No Uncut footage(especially part 7 which has TONS of cut scenes) No 3-d part 3, etc. God do I wish New Line had the rights to ALL these movies, then we'd have a worthwhile box set with UNCUT movies! As it stands, this is a cheap piece of trash and hopefully Paramount will put out a decent HD-DVD box set when that becomes the norm because this is ridiculous!"
5,How can you go wrong with this many horror classics in a set,"All of the Friday the 13th movies are fun in their own silly and demented way. I've never been able to get enough of the antics of those crazy counselors with a death wish that visit Camp Crystal Lake year after year. This box set gives you a chance to view the best installments that this series had to offer (part 6 is my personal favorite). The special features are interesting too since we get to hear from the filmmakers, including several cast members on a commentary track for part three. I highly recommend this set, but don't forget to buy Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason if you want to own a complete set!"
5,Friday the 13th box set,"These movies are really good & I like how there are 2 movies per DVD. There is a bonus DVD which shows the making of all of the movies which is really cool, I've never seen that before! I would definately reccommend buying the Friday the 13th collection."
1,boring,"These movies sucked not intertaing not nothing. These jason movies were corney how can you like them its the same stupid thing, a killer wearing a hockey mask killing teenagers cause he dos'nt want them around crystal lake cause thats were he died at, always standing behinde waiting for you to run and then he walks slow, these movies sucked they were repitive and corney the nightmare on elm street movies were better then these whack jason movies, so these movies sucked."
3,Halloween is better!!!,"I have nothing against the box set or anything. To me the box set is not worth buying because ""Friday the 13th"" isn't worth watching. For any fans who are into Jason, why don't yall drop this retard and watch a real killa (Michael Myers). To me Jason is a wannabe Michael Myers. All of a sudden he becomes a zombie and walks slow (like Myers). It took three to four movies to get an actual theme to his movies. It took him about the same time to get a mask. Myer's mask looks a lot better than some hockey mask. His storylines suck. At least Michael Myers kills for a purpose and have his own music. Halloween movies overall are better than Friday the 13th. Most fans would probably have to agree that Halloween movies are more intresting too."
1,Save your money on this one!,"Normally I love the Friday the 13th movies so I thought I would buy this box set from Amazon. When it arrived I must say I wasn't very impressed at all with how the box set looked. Besides the fact that Paramount released it on 5 slim cases with 2 movies on each disc... on the 3rd disc, part 6 would not even play at all! The only thing about this set was the special features. Other than that, this set is not worth the money!"
5,Visual Futurist: Syd Mead,"Definitely a MUST buy for anyone interested in Syd Meads Career, it also includes a little dvd sized poster of one of his artworks which was a nice touch. I would of liked to of seen a more of the behind the scenes of some of his projects such as Blade runner, but all in all if you after a Documentary about Syd Mead that is what you will get and a nice montage type review of his concept art."
5,Dust For Life rules,"Sadly, Dust For Life has been on hiatus for much too long. Their self produced second release was almost as good as the first one, but since they do not have a record label to promote it...we are all screwed. I've been a huge fan of theirs since they first came out and was actually able to see them perform ""Nightbreed"" before they ever recorded it. It's such a shame that they are not around or can not be heard on the radio anymore cause they were a great band.I guess there are a few similarities towards Alice in Chains present in the record, but then again...who hasn't been influenced by AIC? I sincerely hope that they release another album again, because it would be most welcomed by the die hard fans.Highly recommended tracks on this album would be ""Degrees Of Black"", ""Nightbreed"", and ""Cycle of Frustration"". [...]"
2,disappointment.,"I bought this book based on a review, by its author, of Poul Anderson's ""The Broken Sword"" and thought that, with such critique of this latter book, this author really should have something above average to add to the Norse Saga genre.I was greatly disappointed. The pace is slow, the interest in the story and what happens to its characters ( that, admittedly, starts promisingly ) quickly fades away and the reading experience turns into an exercise in boredom.I give it 2 stars because of the huge effort in material and data collection that the author carried out, which is, in any case, worth of note.But the end result is a bore, I am very sorry to say."
5,Great,I love all of Salvatore books about drizzt can't wait to read the next this series is the best i
4,"good book, but I dislike what happened to Wulfgar","I have loved these books from the beginning and enjoy all of the books Salvatore has written. I own them all but my biggest problem was what happened to Wulfgar, he was by far my favorite before his untimely disapearanc but after he returned he turned out to be very different than I had hopped for. I dearly wish for Bob to write a final chapter to this wonderfull saga. Please include every one including Jarlaxle Bob. I must agree let Drizzt fall for the lady of Silverymoon or try to include her somewhere. Keep them comming."
3,Not the best of the series but Salvatore is back on track,"I almost didn't want to buy this book since Passage to Dawn was so bad (actually it started out pretty good but went down hill fast). I was pleasantly surprised with the Silent Blade; I especially liked the return of Jarlaxle. A few things that I didn't like were the length of the book (it's pretty short), and I wasn't very impressed with Salvatore depiction of Calimport. Calimport is supposed to have an Arabian culture. I thought Salvatore didn't do a very good job with the names and descriptions of the city, they didn't sound very Arabian to me. All in all this is pretty good book that fans of the Dark elf series will enjoy. I also agree with what the other reviewer said about the artwork. Drizzt's face is too full and doesn't look anything like an elf. My favorite artwork has to be The Crystal Shard; the artist (Larry Elmore) did a fantastic job with that cover!"
4,Good but not great,"As a long time Salvatore fan I feel I have an insight into the greatness the he is capable of. Homeland, Sojourn and the earier titles were in a word, AWESOME. Passage to Dawn however showed an almost hurry up and get the book out mentality. The silent Blade is definately one of the top 4 books in the series. The best and most interesting character continues to be Artimis Entreri. I mean this guy truly deserves his own title. I would love to read the story of his childhood, and rise to power on the streets of Calimport. Of course Drizzt is still the man however. His ongoing romantic triangle with Cattie-Brie and Wulfgar (why couldn't he stay dead...I mean until this book he was so cliche) remains an cornerstone in the series. NO MORE DRIZZT-ARTIMIS fights. Enough is enough. Now Drizzt-Jarlaxle, that would be worth the price of admission."
5,Dark Ranger sacrifices himself for those he loves?,"Is it possible that the Dark Ranger can defeat any foe except death? Perhaps in this last installment, R.A. Salvatore finally faces Drizzt's mortality and lets our Hero say goodbye to us in a way in which we will always remember and never forget. Sacrifice his life for the life of those he calls his friends, his family. I dont know the outcome but this bard will sing the Deeds of the Dark Ranger untill death stills my tongue and steals my voice."
2,"OH OH, RA SALVATORE - A REALLY BAD JOB","I loved the previous dark-elf books; but since ""passage to down"" they just get boring. You always hear the same things, you are forced to read the 1231841th fight to death between Drizzt and Entreri. After reading this book,i realized that the main characters have become immortal. I was glad about Wulfgars come-back from abyss, but now i really think it was the wrong decision. There is no tension to read thrugh the chapters, because you know that drizzt will always do the right things and he will never fail. Really sad.The reasons why i give 2 stars? Some passages are interesting to read and I really enjoyed salvatores previous books. Lets hope he will do a better job next time"
1,C**P IF I'VE EVER SEEN IT,"Where is the plot? the logic? no matter what, entreri isbound to find out that drizzt is stil alive...so what's the point ofthis book? wulfgar...who cares?"
3,Disappointed Fan,"As an avid reader of Forgotten Realms books and a huge fan of R.A. Salvatore, I must say I am a bit disappointed with Salvatore's last two efforts with the ""companions of the hall"". I think there was a blatant lack of anything that resembles conclusion in ""Silent Blade"", and Drizzt (previously one of my favorite characters) whines more than ever. I did like the angle with Wulfgar, and hopefully we will see more installments on this (although I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that he was brought back from the dead in ""Passage to Dawn""). Also, it was cool to see Jarlaxle and Entreri working in concert in Calimport.The book was captivating as with all Salvatore's works, but too open ended. That's great if there are to be more books, but if not...well.Looking for a follow-up Bob."
4,Excellent Novel that has the door left open for more!,"I'll Keep this review short and sweet. An excellent return this time (""Passage to Dawn"" was good, but the ending seemed rushed to me). The 3 characters with 3 different paths (Wulfgar, Drizzt, and Artemis) Drizzt and Artemis being opposites and Wulfgar at a crossroad to decide his destiny? Excellent story telling! There has to be another novel and Salvatore HAS to write it! I look forward to the Forgotten Realms AD&D module due out soon. The Adventure's of Drizzt and his friends are becoming as dear to me, if not more dear, then the character's of The Lord of the Ring."
3,We know Bob can do better.,It seemed to me that R.A. Salvatore ran out of a storyline for Drizzt in this book and had to reuse some of his old storylines. Maybe even a great character has his limit as a the subject of a good novel? I think that an entirely new and challanging storyline would have been a better fit for a dynamic character like Drizzt or maybe Bob's literary talent would have been better used writing a side novel about one of the other characters? I am pleased that Bob does not confine his talent exclusively to Drizzt books. Maybe its time to end his saga?
1,How can you limit quantity to 10 lousy mending plates?,"I've been trying for half an hour to buy 100 zinc plated mending plates, National #N272-716 2""X 1/2"" and I keep getting sent back that only 10 can be bought. Is this some kind of mixup? What gives?"
5,Nice!,"great price, great product, fast shipping, exactly what I wanted, and expected!i would recommend these to people who like a more classic style look."
3,A little dissapointing,"As I also own the three Over America series Movies in BD, so I was looking forward to this one. But Over Ireland while the pictures are stunning and the narative is good, The speed in which the scenery flashes by is too quick. this results in frequent backtracking and pausing just to get a good view of the magnificient sights. If only there was a way to slow the movie down in many places this would have been really great."
3,Review of Over Ireland,"Scenery - fantastic, what can I say.Music - At times far too loud and I much prefer natural sounds likewater, seagulls etc... Music is a choice of the director andnot always the choice of the viewer!! Would have been betterwithout. You have the option to watch the dvd without thecommentary but not to hear the commentary without the music.Commentary - Ok but in parts this was totally drowned out by themusic !!!!! Which was a big, big mistake. I bought thisas an educational tool for foreign students, howeverI had trouble making out what was being said so theywould have no chance !! Sorry but the quality of themusic and commentary was a big disappointment to me.I hope the makers read this and take on board myconstructive criticism. Thank you."
5,Great sensors and great price,Bought these for my truck and are much better than Bosch O2 sensors for a Dodge/Chrysler vehicle. Have bought more since this for another car. Fast shipping from Amazon as well!
2,missing cds into the cases,"I bought this series totally new cause it is a nice tv show but when i wrapped out the box set i opened the dvd cases and they are empty the cds are not inside although it looks toitally new, but maybe it is a fabric mistake because cases are empty"
5,We bought this for a Christmas gift for my brother....,"...because we loved the series and knew he would, too. (Not to mention that we had seen both seasons except the very first two episodes, and hoped to borrow it from him when he finished watching it, sometime down the road.) As it turned it, he loved it so much he watched the whole series, nearly 30 hours, in a two day marathon a couple days after Christmas, so we got to see the first two episodes sooner than we thought!"
1,Undisclosed information,"I ordered this thinking that they, actually, had already made a nice complete set with season One and Two. I returned it because all it was was Season One Box Set and Season Two Single Container in a special box made to house the two. I already had bought the two same identical seasons. I didn't need to pay $50.00 for cardboard that was housing the two that I had already ordered. I don't like being mislead and I'm sure everybody out there doesn't like it either."
5,Better than Masotoshi Nakayama Kata books,excellent book.for any Shotokan Deshi(student) to a Soke(Grand Master). It can be used as a reference or a get-to-learn-your-katas book!The book also has tips on powering up your Ki(internal force).Also the book has the human animation instead of pictures. it shows u directons with arrows and how fast u should do them.it even tells how many seconds to focus after every step. It never gets complicated either. Forget Nakayama (with all due respect) this book will blow the cover off of any Kata teching book. Please buy this book if you are serious about learning Katas.
5,very good for those who really like to train,the book is very accurate the katas are painted beutifully.
2,Enigma:The Battle for the Code,Lots of superfulous information with periodic ramblings. Really more scholarly than my interest in casual reading. A bit of a struggle to get through it all.
4,It's so cute!,"I really like this little burner, it's adorable, it works like it says it will, and it comes with some starter insense. Just so you know, though, this is a tiny little burner (I'll put up some photos for scale). I went and ordered full size insense sticks for this when I should have bought some cones or some bricks, like it came with. The smoke isn't as obvious as it is in the picture, but if you look, you can see it. I was surprised how well it scented my room for being such a tiny little thing. Overall, I'm very pleased."
5,Love this pinon incense!,"I bought this to go with a DVD that mimics a fireplace. So now I have three senses covered...visual, audio (snapping cinders from the ""fire"") and olefactory. No heat, but then again, no mess. Be sure to follow the instructions on the little pellets to get them to burn completely. This incense burner is a very enjoyable way to scent the house for the holidays."
1,Burner may be stretching it . . . .,"Piece looks cheaply made, which wouldn't be so bad if it worked properly. Impossible to burn the natural wood incense with the cabin in place. Put the top on and the incense goes out."
2,350 Buyer beware! Defective Gas tanks!,"I recently bought a new Husqvarna 350 Chainsaw. I have owned many Husqies and let me tell you they are a great machine. That is why I did not hesitate to buy another. I ended up buying the the 350. Got it home loaded it up with fuel and would'nt you know, gas started coming out of a seam at the base of the plastic handle. Apparently The base of the handle is also used as a resevoir for the fuel capacity. The handle is a molded plastic and has a seam right down the middle. If you check the instruction manual they recomend putting your foot through this to hold it steady whiloe starting the motor. What Genious thought up the idea of using an injection molded handle to become a resivoir for the fuel tank??? Anyone remember the Ford Pinto gas Tank from the 70's??? Must be the same engineer working on this design? I notified Husqy. I'll be interested to see how they handle this one?"
1,The Art of Fauz,I don't have anything personal against this book.I have dabbled in faux finishes and wanted more ideas on how to do different techniques and this book was too technical for me. It was more to do with making your own glazes and customizing your paints and info on the many utensils etc. I needed something more basic.I just want to be able to go to the store buy my own premade glaze and paint colors and then do a finish.
4,Better than Just an Ordinary Day,"The unfinished novel _Come Along With Me_ is wonderful; too bad so little of it exists. And the stories here are great, too. As far as Shirley Jackson's uncollected stories go, this is the book to pick up."
4,Oy vei!,"What an hilarious read!I'm a BIG Jane-ite and thought this would just be a cute book, but it kept me reading for one whole day. I had to put it down last night around 2am, and couldn't wait until lunch today to finish it (which I just did). Althought some of the P&P parallels seem pushed and strained, it was a nice adaptation...especially making the Bennets, Bingleys and Darcys elderly Jews in Florida. What a twist! Even a shiksa like me had no problem following along. A perfect Hanukkah (or Christmas) gift for the Austen lovers in your family. What a riot!"
4,Great entry-point for the curious,"This wonderfully illustrated-yet-informative translation of the classic text breaks down the classic Kama Sutra text in a way tat's mindful of the roots of the culture from which the tome was spawned, while being accessible for the merely curious. A great launching pad for the curious and a nice, quick reference for those who use the kama Sutra for more than reading. Coupled with ""The Complete Kama Sutra"", you should have no more questions."
1,Motorola has QA problems,"I should have listened when people told me about Motorola's quality issues. When I tried to charge my brand new phone, it gave an ""Unable to Charge"" message. Shouldn't Motorola have caught this before shipping it?"
3,"Yes to RAZR, no to Cingular","I was going to buy this phone and deal, but the reviews and comments on Cingular are horrendous. Apparently, they've taken on so many customers (this is especially true in the North East) that there networks can't support all the callers during peak hours. Dropped calls, no reception, etc.So sad."
5,Razor,"Love it!! Best phone I have had so far. The picture quality of the display is great, the camera and overall phone quality are also excellent. I wish the volume of the earpiece was a little louder but overall a great phone. Cingular coverage in the phoenix area is sketchy and unpredictable at best...... previously I had Sprint wich had better coverage but I really wanted this phone so I switched."
1,cingular + RAZR = headache,Dont lose your peace of mind over this deal. Its worth spending money than to get trapped in this offer.
2,GET T-MOBILE RAZR!!!!!!!!,"Don't get the cingular razr. The t mobile one is better! the t mobile razr has stronger reception (verizon is the best reception, but at least t mobile is better than cingular) plus AIM and camcorder. Plus, its cheaper than cingular silver razr. SO GET THE T-MOBILE RAZR AND AVOID CINGULAR RAZR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Does everything it's supposed to...,"I have had this phone for about 3 months now, and I love it. For the camera it's got, it takes great pictures (if you want print quality pics, get a digital camera). The video camera is an awesome feature, too. Mine didn't come with the video enabled, but I figured out how to mod the phone, so that's ok.I think one of the things I love most about this phone is the ease of customizing it to fit my personality. With Motorola's Mobile Phone Tools software and a USB cable (neither is included, which is why I only gave it 4 stars) you can put your own ringtones, graphics, etc. on the phone.The only quirk I've noticed is that sometimes the phone 'hides' phone numbers that have been stored in my address book, but I'm sure they'll figure this out soon!Overall, I'm very satisfied with the phone and it's functionality. I had realistic expectations (I don't expect a mobile phone to do more than make calls, really), and it exceeded all of them."
1,sleek but problems already.,"I had the RAZR (pink) for 2 days and the phone started a low pitched buzzing noise whenever it was on. I got a replacement and the 2nd phone started buzzing after another day. The salesperson said they have had problems with this phone and thought they (Cingular)had returned all the problem phones. Guess not. Now I have to exchange this one too. What a hassle. One the bright side, it has very long battery life and pretty sleek looking."
3,"Good phone, shady rebate!!!","I bought this phone about 3 weeks ago and must say that the phone itself is very nice. So far, I have absolutely no complaints! HOWEVER, you have to wait 6 months before you can even send in the rebate. This is not that big of a deal but here is where it gets interesting. I bought the phone with new Cingular service and wanted to transfer my existing number (from my old service provider) to my new account. If you do that, then you lose your rebate eligibility. So if you're like me, beware of the ""conditions"" of the rebate. Still an awesome phone though. Although it could use some more choices for ring tones."
2,"Too big, not enough features...","While this phone is thin, it is too bulky to handle, and seems flimsy. Its also hard to navigate through common features such as the alarm clock, and the camera isn't great. I wouldn't recommend it for this price. This phone seems almost archaic, like one of those really old cell phones, but just with a camera tacked onto it..."
2,don't make the same mistake as me,"i used to love motorola clamshell phones. i used to have the original star-tac, i even loved my v-60. HOWEVER. the RAZR was such a disappointment. after reading the other bad reviews, i still committed to the phone since i had such great experiences with past motorola phones - that was a mistake. worst cell phone ever. it's uncomfortable to hold, and the service through cingular is spotty."
1,Fancy looking - Crap phone,"I took a cingular plan with mortorola ROKR phone. uhh.. i just returned the phone after 3 days. Its sucks lot of battery, enough if you don't use MP3 player. I had to recharge my phone almost every day. If you talk continuously for 2 hours, the phone goes off. Returned ROKR picked RAZR black.Motorola RAZR looks nice though.I was thrilled to have Razr blk . We had few of my friends who fancied for this phone. We just realised all the phones has a kinda noise. Try this for yourself. Keep the phone close to your ears. Listen to it with little attention. huh.......you would definitely hear the transitor tuning kinda noise. I checked with few of other friends' phones .All gave the same irritating noise. Worst thing is when u make calls the person on the other side can hear the this noise.Careful : Watch out for this .If you are prepared to live with the noise , this phone is really cool.Pros :1) Nice lookingCons :1) Battery life is poor.2) Crappy Menu structure3) Noisy."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"I bought the razr thinking that it was one of the best products on the market, and am disappointed in its performance. Things to consider if you are thinking about buying it:1) volume is very low. it's fine for normal situations, but if you are in a semi-noisy environment, the highest volume is still difficult to hear2) placement of buttons on the phone - volume control is on the opposite side of other buttons. when holding the phone and trying to adjust, your thumb hits the other buttons so you have to hold the phone in an awkward position to only adjust what you want to adjust!3) backlighting dims to save energy - this is great, but its difficult to see things (numbers, incoming calls, etc) when you are on a call and the lighting has gone off.the phone is indeed sleek and compact, but i think these are only marginal improvements over other models and don't compensate for the design problems above."
2,bad phone and worse service,the phone is bad...the battery life terrible...barely 24 hrs...and worst is that when is i went to the cingular store to get things rectified..not only were the sales rep(from whom we got the ph) rude and impolite but also gave us a hard time.we cancelled the service and returned the phone...so good luck...if u are planning on going with cingular.ps cingular has the WORST customer service i ve come across.they just wont listen to u...
1,Poorly contstruct hinge,The back breaks easily and the wires are in the backand this causes the phone not to workeven if it slips off the chair the hinge can breakand they say it is user abuseI cannot believe thisand they want 100 dollars to fix it or moreBEWARE! Not for kid use and not teenager friendlyso do not waste your money!
5,amazing amazing amazing,i'm a kid and i loved this book. it was funny and i totally related to the kid david!!!!!!
5,Wonderful and Versatile,I've used this flour along with the pkg recommended amounts of Xanthum gum as a flour replacement in many traditional recipes from muffins to pancakes.I highly recommend this as a wheat free gluten free flour.
4,Great Value,Gluten free flour can be expensive. When this deal came up I grabbed it. We now have plenty of flour
2,Packages Broken,I opened my box and flour came out everywhere! Out of 4 packages at least 1 package is broken in the box.
2,Bad Aftertaste - better alternatives for same $,"Bob's has done a good job making a wide variety of gluten free flours available for those of us with dietary needs. However, this particular blend is not worth the money.I believe it's the fava beans, but whatever it is, one of the ingredients leaves that nasty, ""ugh this definitely gluten free"" aftertaste. Don't bake with this stuff - no amount of sugar will cover the nasty taste!There are better alternatives -baking: King Arthur Flour and/or Gluten Free Pantry AP flour are really good options. KAF is the expensive one but you will not be able to tell a taste difference hardly at all. GFP is cheaper and still tastes pretty good.general cooking: you can usually get away with using corn flour (masa harina, look for Maseca brand) if you don't want to use real AP flour, which is pretty cheap and easy to find at the grocery. Otherwise, you could use Bob's rice, potato, etc flours and make your own blend. But I wouldn't use this prepackaged one - gross!"
2,terrible flavor,Granted I am new to the Gluten Free life - but this flour tasted toxic. I have decided to mix my own flour combos and avoid this one - I expected more from this brand!
2,"odd taste, grainy","I have tried it a couple times and fine I can only use it in savory dishes. Not at all for baking. There is an odd taste to items I have baked. Cookies, pie crust, etc are not good. There is also a grainy fill to items I have cooked using it. I fine I prefer King Arthur."
1,Not too good,"I decided to try a bag at a store first before buying in bulk here - man I am glad I did. I didn't really think about the ingredients too much, figuring if it was called ""all purpose flour"" it would probably work in anything - wrong! Though the texture is nice, the smell and taste completely overpower that benefit.I tried using these to make cookies, and it was horrible...way too much after taste of the bean flavor. Also, the fava bean thing kind of scares me too - apparently kids should not eat it because of possible health risks if they have certain genetic dispositions. Bob's Red Mill has some great stuff that is gluten free, but this one should be labeled as ""garbanzo/fava bean flour"", not all purpose."
2,Maybe I was spoiled w/ regular wheat flour...,"Yuck! This turned my favorite choco chip cookies to yucky. I may be spoiled with the wheat flour, but since my husband was just discovered to have a sensitivity to gluten, I am experimenting. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my husband and kids thought they were okay. I can't stand the aftertaste, which in reading the other comments must be the bean flour in the mixture. There must be a better mixture of gluten free flour out there!"
1,Check the clearance above your current mirror before purchase.,"The unit wouldn't work on either of my vehicles because there isn't enough room beween the top of the OEM mirror and the roof of the car.I could see how this could be an excellent item, but may not work on newer cars. I have an 08 Avalance and 08 VW Beetle. I purchased for the Bug, but decided to try it on the Chevy which it also didn't fit.Make sure you have about 3 inches (best guess) clearance above existing or don't purchase. I'm happy with refund policy, but no matter how great it is it is still not as good as getting something that works upfront.:)"
2,Would think twice.....,"I bought these because I really liked the lanyard so the iPod could hang around my neck when I exercised. That is a great feature BUT, the Right headphone stopped working about 4 months after I bought these. I bought another pair and eventually the Right headphone, again, stopped working. The sound volume isn't good either!! Unfortunately, I bought mine at a big box retailer for $49.99. Do yourself a favor and buy a pair of $20 headphones where BOTH headphones will work and the volume is MUCH better!"
2,Maybe this will grow on me,"This metal slide whistle is fun to play but seems to have a much less crisp tone and less steady and less ready sound than the much less expensive plastic whistle that caused me to want this metal one. I can accompany string band CD's on the plastic one with ease. Maybe this one needs more breaking in, but so far, not so good."
2,From a professional musician,"Well, I wanted it to play the piccolo part to Stars and Stripes Forever. Plastic ones work fine, are colorful for the show...but don't last long. Unfortunately...this metal one is an octave lower. Big difference. Fine for a mellower tone (I wasn't after that...I wanted something high and bright). Not a lot of volume. I think I can overcome the stiffness in action. BTW, I am a professional trombonist as well (just perform). None of the other reviews address this."
2,No pictures...,"The whole point of this book seems to be the pictures that go along with the story. However, there are no pictures in the kindle version!"
4,Fun Fantasy,"Continues the story begun in Starry Child. In fact would be hard to follow if you haven't read Hanna's first book in the series. Fun fantasy, good ""beach book""."
3,Nice But Not Great,"Well researched but fails to provide specific information, i.e., dates of manufacture for different movements. Sent an e-mail to the author which he answered but he failed to address this issue. Great on graphics but short on details."
1,Thumbs Down. Way Down.,"Get excited. Animate your voice. Use props. But nothing at all to back it up.The tape is low quality and sounds like it was recorded at a bingo-hall during intermission.Not only couldn't the host tell a good story, he seemed very amused with himself --for instance by uncontrollably giggling at his own jokes and antics--.Shame on Mr. Hall and his publisher for marketing this tape!"
2,Don't waste your time.,"I read this book and the Syngress book. This book has many typos, at least one of which could confuse the reader, it is very poorly organized, and it doesn't cover many details needed for the test. I was unimpressed with this book. I felt like I had wasted my money. The Syngress book was a little better."
3,fun for killing time,"good collection of classic games for those of us that remember feeding video machines quarters. Little hard to control some of the games like Defender with out a joystick. Some kind of strategy overview for some of the games with combinations, like Mortal Combat, would have been nice. Good luck remembering all those ""finish him"" combo's."
5,angel,I gave this as a gift to a man who had everything that he could possibly want. He loved it and I found that he enjoyed the mix very well. Thank you for the presentation of this item as well as for the very satisfying results.
2,Interesting saxophone pieces,"This CD contains some of the most interesting pieces written for saxophone. The performers have good technical skills, but unfortunately their tone quality is very poor."
3,"Last good OS for older, slower PCs.","This Second Edition improves upon Windows 98 by fixing 20,000 bugs and enhancing usability and stability. Windows XP is far more stable and prettier though, and highly recommended. Here's What You Need to Use Windows XP:A PC with 300 megahertz (MHz) or higher processor, 233-MHz minimum required; Intel Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible processor; 128 megabytes (MB) of RAM or higher(64 MB minimum supported; may limit performance and some features); 1.5 gigabyte (GB) of available hard disk space; Super VGA (800 600) or higher resolution video adapter and monitor; CD-ROM or DVD drive; Keyboard and Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device."
4,"good product, but.....","good product, however I would have liked a users manual that came with it new....oh well"
2,A book of lists,"Unless you want a full documentation on the history and licensing of Linux, don't bother with this book. All the ""application development"" sections are nothing but lists. They are vast lists, but there are no explainations with them (I mean to the point that he drops function names without telling you even so much as their signature.) It seems as though the author knows what function calls and macros are available in the Linux API but has no idea what they do, and therefore neither will you. The only reason I give this book two stars is for its GNU section (but you can buy ""Programming with GNU Software"" for that). You are much better off with ""Advanced Programming in a UNIX Environment"" or, for a beginner, ""Beginning Linux Programming"". As a final thought, I really wish that someone could write a book on Linux that could parallel Stevens' UNIX book."
4,Excellent C language introduction,"This is a well written introduction to C development on Linux starting with the very basics of process and file I/O, going all the way through networking, regular expressions and lightweight databases. The first few chapters go over the differences between Linux and unix. Then cover development tool basics.This is a high end reference that is light on screenshots (almost none), that has well written and annotated example code. It's reminiscent of the classic Advanced Unix Programming. With the exception that this book is larger and has better exposition. In particular this book will answer almost any question you have about file I/O, process management, and networking.This is an excellent book. It gets my full recommendation."
4,his truth is marching on,"His truth is marching on is a great story about love, war, and faith. It is a novel with very good historical references. I finished this book in just a few days amd was relutant to put it down when I had to. A very gripping and good book."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book when it first came out years ago. Fast read, but not interesting at all. I've been a fan of Omar Tyree ever since he captured me with Flyy Girl. And once I read a book and it becomes one of my favorites, I tend to support the author. Well, to be honest,I cannot seem to finish many of Tyree's books and I have the majority of all his books. Now what I do is read the reviews before I buy books ( and I only buy hardcover, a preference that I like) because I do not have money to waste. In the process of spring cleaning right now and I am about to donate all of his books I have to the Salvation Army. I have a new favorite in my life now....Eric Jerome Dickey."
3,IDk,"The book was OK. I thought it would be a lot better than what it was.It was bad I guess I just expected more rawness because it is entitled, ""Diary of a Groupie""."
2,Could've been better,"I wasn't too thrilled with the book. The whole set up became confusing, and I thought that her diary would be juicier. It was written well, but it was kinda boring"
1,what the......?,"I figured I would give mr tyree another chance, but I have no idea what he was trying to do in this book. It jumps from one idea to another. When the book starts to get interesting he jumps right into twist and turns. I think this book will have a sequel but I hope not.DO NOT BUY, SAVE YOUR MONEY, BORROW SOMEONE'S BOOK WHO HAS ALREADY BROUGHT IT!!!!!!"
2,still not as good as flyy girl,"Okay the last book I purchased from Omar Tyree was Sweet St. Louis. I had bought all of his releases prior to that and became disappointed with Sweet St. Louis. I said that I would not buy anymore of his books, but would borrow them or get the from the library. Well when I read the reviews for Diary of a Groupie I decided to give Mr. Tyree another chance. Bad idea. The book ...! The only character that was given any depth was Tabitha even though there were many other main characters. I found myself saying throughout the novel, ""Huh? Who is (insert name) and where/when did he/she come into this?"" or, ""What happened to (insert person/event/thing)."" Just not a good book at all. Sorry Omar I will not buy anymore of your novels. I mean it this time."
2,ummmm,"i feel disappointed with the story. i know he is an author and i imagined he put his all into this book. so i am not going to slaughter him. because i love his books if it wasnt for him we would not have flyy girl and leslie and the other books. but this story was ok. it wasnt what i thought it would be. i expected it to be just more adventure and understand a lil bit more. i would suggest to pick the book up at your library i would suggest that with any book. but overall it was just ok, nothing really stood out, that was exciting to me. so like i said i love omary tyree and different strokes for different folks so i know someone out there really enjoyed the book. or will enjoy it, you just have to see for yourself"
2,I liked it!,"I read all the amazon reviews first before picking up this book. and, i have to say, the book was good. i was waiting to find out what would happen at each page. i could hardly put it down. but i have to say, i was dissappointed w/ the ending. i d/n feel that mr. tyree explained everything..it felt like a rushed job to tie up loose ends. but it by far was the best tyree book that i have read thus far. it was a good read."
3,Not as good as I thought,When I found out this book was comming out I was so excited..because it seemed to be a very good but. Well I was fooled I love Omar Tyree's books but this one is not one that I will be reading again.I mean if you need something to read because your having a dry book spell then read this one.
3,Not One of Omar Tyree's Best,This was interesting... but it seems to be missing something. Not one of his best but a cool chill out book.
1,I did not like this book..,"i cant really rate this book..but i had too or i couldnt post...because i did not like it...Im a fan of omar tyree books and this book did not caputure my attention at all.I thought this book was going to be about a average""groupie"",but it was not even like that.I did not really get the book-and i agree with a reviewer on here that it jumped from one idea to another...Omar step it up a bit man.i know you can..im just keeping it real...ps...im still a fan of yours"
2,This Climax Wasn't Earth-Shattering,"Okay, let's start with the positives. The cover is delicious looking, you will want to pick the book up and investigate what's inside.And, now the bad...upon further investigation you might find yourself stumbling upon a mangled mess. Unrealistic dialogue, perplexing character behaviors, no tingling suspense or excitement.It would have been nice to see this potentially explosive book developed in a way that included heartfelt emotions, thrilling plot changes, and meaningful character interactions. I hope the next book is an upgrade."
3,"Cute gift, taste ok....","This is a cute gift for kids but I'm not bowled over by the taste. The chocolate has some aftertaste to it, not the best but ok..."
1,Fastwolf is a fake Indian,"I bought and reviewed this video and there is nothing Native American about this production. At various times in her life this woman was Lakota, Apache, Mohawk, and while the Fast Wolf name is Lakota, she is not. She is not an elder of any tribe, the Apache did not do the water ceremony, all this came out of her own head and not from any legitimate Indian nation. A series of articles about this fake elder and medicine woman came out in Indian Country a few years ago. Researchers were unable to find a single connection from this woman to any American Indian tribe. She is of Scottish and English ancestry and has no documented connection to Indians beyond the visions in her head. Do not waste your money on this trash."
1,Not THAT Authentic Native American Spirituality,"I was disappointed in this purchase as I was looking for an authentic Native American product. I lead a women's Bible study and spirituality group and we had been doing a study on world faiths. Of course, we wanted to look at the spiritual paths of the First Nations, so I went looking for multi-media resources specifically about storytelling. THIS was NOT a good choice for us.If you are looking for a funky, new age experience with a bunch of women who seem to be from Germanic countries, this is for you. Something about it lacks sincerity and honesty.Other than it being borderline offensive to Native peoples, it is an annoying production with eery music and a creepy overdubbed narration. Ms. Fast Wolf is undoubtedly a beautiful, grandmotherly woman with quite a strong presence, but I wonder what her clan (if she is truly of one) really feels about her practices.Save your money and look for more authentic Native American resources."
2,Weak strap construction,"Used this product for about a month before one of the two straps that holds it to the leg ripped off. Overall design was good - comfortable, flexible - but if it won't stay on your leg it's of zero value."
1,Good for delicate people only,"excuse my english but if youre a delicate person then its good for you but if youre like myself then this product would last arround 4 days like mines,, all i did was walk to my job for half hour and it began tearing apart; it wasnt defective , its the material its made out of,,, the product itself is a good idea but the material is delicate"
2,Wanted Something More Real,"I read one of Mr. Murray's books prior to this one. Of course it wasn't the best read, but I devour anything featuring an interracial/multicultural relationship.I would suggest checking this book out from the library because you'll be pissed at yourself for buying something that played up the stereotypes of ethnic characters you've tried to run from your whole life. It's a poor day indeed when you wished the hero would pack his bags and find another woman."
1,disappointing,"Not much else to say. Have seen no improvenment when useing this product. One of thiose times you'd like to return the item but the shipping the return makes it a lose, lose, lose."
5,HUSBAND'S HOBBY,GAVE THIS BOOK AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. THIS MAY BECOME A NEW PROJECT AS MY HUSBAND IS A AVID BIRD WATCHER AND LOVES BUILDING FEEDERS AND HOUSES FOR OUR VISITORS
2,Great...at first,"This water filter system worked great for the 1st 3 months. Now it leaks so badly that I am switching brands (even though I still have several filters left). I thought perhaps it was just mine, but a friend's has the same problem."
4,shoddy product no support,"I am currently on my second Pur filter system. The first one broke not long after I bought it but I couldn't find my receipt. My parents love theirs, so I decided to give it a second chance. Well I've only had it a few months and it fell off the faucet. I tried to put it back but now it keeps falling. This time I went to the Pur site but there is NO customer support. They give you a phone number but it is only a recording and there is no email address or any way to contact the company. I will NEVER buy another one. (I have updated my score - see my additional review for info.)"
1,Half-Star if I could,"Yep! My third or fourth in a couple of years. Thought a friend who used to drop by often had ""heavy hands and was squeezing it hard."" Nope. They just crack, right around the viewing window. Cheaply made, and they know it. Just look at all the reviews on dozens of sites. DON'T BUY PERIOD!"
2,Why keep the flouride in?,"If you want flouride, eat toothpaste! Just kidding. Flouride is a poison, that's how it kills bacteria. There's better ways to protect your teeth, and your CHILDREN'S. Is there any filter that removes estrogen and medicines from the water supply?"
1,Grrrrrr!@,"After only 5 months, a pinhole leak developed in the plastic near the window, making it worthless.The filtering is great, the quality control is lousy. Expensive and unreliable in the long term (I have now gone through three of these, all that failed)."
1,Great for a week,"Just like it has for everyone else, this thing worked for me for a few weeks, then all of a sudden the water slows to a trickle. It has happened like clockwork for several filters. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,WAY overhyped,I just don't get why this book is so popular and gets so many great reviews. There was a lot of useless fluff in it. The only good point was about the three types of entrepreneurs - and that's been covered by many other reviewers here. And that's the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1.Save your time and money and find a real business book.
3,Business or Romance?,"This book reads more like a romance novel than a business book. The author has some good ideas, but nothing new or earth shattering. The big put off for me is how he ""interacts"" with Sarah who owns a pie making business. Starring into each others eyes and her 15 minute description of lying in bed as a child dreaming about wild horses, which I can't find any connection to business. This would be a much shorter book, and better, if the filler was removed and just business basics were left.With that being said the actual business parts do have some good ideas and ways to look at situations in a different light. I would recommend it as decent reading if you get it at a good price."
