2,pictures weren't cute,and the writing inside left a lot to be desired. I had a hard time reading it. felt like something was missing. rhyme perhaps?
4,Very Pleased,"It was very simpleto install the net in my Chevy Impala. It works very well for groceries,especially bottles and gallon milk jugs."
4,Good product,This is extremely useful and stops groceries from rolling around the back of the car. This compares well with the manufacture accessory but at a fraction of the cost. Good quality.
5,my new cargo net,"This is such a great cargo net. I have a 2003 Honda SUV and I bought one of these back when I bought my car new, in 2003. I just replaced it because the stretch was now wearing out. 8 years I had this cargo net, and I use it all the time. It is great for groceery shopping and it is great to help organize things when you travel. I just love mine."
4,Not bad for the price,"Not quite universal, I have a 2003 lincoln aviator which is the same size an explorer and the net barely reached (had to stretch the net out). Overall I do not regret buying this product."
3,deceptive photo,"Don't expect this cargo net to stay neat compartments for storage. Many reviews also mention that stick on hooks do not stay stuck. It's built from somewhat elastic cord. The cord is not cut to lengths needed but one length cord is bent this way and that to follow the compartment shape.Its general construction is, however, what I need, and its price is good for me. I can figure out a way to use it for my needs, but a person without some fabrication skills will find it disappointing."
3,Not bad,This is a decent product. It does the job it was made for. It could have been made with stronger elastic but you get what you pay for I guess.
4,"Good quality, didn't fit my vehicle","The net is made of a stretchy, but sturdy material and comes with decent mounting hardware. I have no complaints about the product itself, and feel it will hold up to several years of use.However, despite the description, there was no good way to install this in my 2006 Chrysler 300. Even if I was willing to make some minor modifications, the net really doesn't stretch far enough for the back of the trunk. In a smaller trunk, bottom hooks would be useful. In fact, no hooks of any kind were included, as you're expected to loop it around the stick-on/screw-on mounting brackets. This was obviously made for the back of an SUV, not ""most"" trunks as advertised.All in all, I think this will be good for its designed use. I'll keep it for an SUV or minivan. But given the slightly misleading description and the need for most people to provide their own attachments, it only deserves 4 stars. If it wasn't a good value at under $20, I'd only give it 3."
3,Not bad!,I like this product... it serves its purpose! My vehicle was already equipped with knobs to hold the net which was great! Because of the open weave things do get stuck in the netting which can be frustrating.
3,No Deep Diving Here,"This novel is pretty lightweight. No deep plot development, characters are so-so and it leaves you feeling like you've spent a few hours that could have been used for something better- in spite of the endorsements by other authors."
4,Sci-Fi Military Soap Opera,"This is the first book in a series and is set in its own 'verse, so there is a fair amount of exposition involved. Mr Green handles it well and avoids the ""As you know, Bob"" dialog which is the curse of the genre. The point of view jumps around the ensemble cast, which can be disorienting if you're not used to it. Had Amazon been around then, I'd have bought more of the series after reading this one."
2,Don't be Duped!,"While this book is an excellent collection of John Coltrane's compositions, I would not recommend buying it. For one thing, all of the music in the book has been transcribed from B flat (the key of tenor sax) to C. So, unless you like to instantaneously transcribe music as you play along, or unless you just want to peck things out on a piano, this book is probably not for you. Another disappointment is that the songs don't include any of Coltrane's solos-- they merely give you the basic, introductory tune of the song, with some chord charts and repeat bars thrown in. Needless to say, I'm returning the book."
3,Sonic explorations limited,"While this trio creates a textural jazz-funk stew as compelling as anyone else, the percussive-heavy material begins to feel repetitious over time, perhaps missing a key ingredient to put it over the edge."
4,Catch a Mosquito,"Definitely a noticeable difference in the amout of mosquitos in my yard, after pluging in this catcher. Works well on my back deck, considering one for front porch. Although moving the catcher to front for a period appears to work just a well. Great product..."
1,Don't waste your money...,"Worthless. Provides no benefit.I bought this early in the summer because we were having the worst mosquito season I can remember.Having used it for several months, I don't believe it made any difference at all. Sure, there were bug pieces in the tray; but my backyard wasn't ANY more liveable.I personally have more success with citronella torches.I wish I had kept my money.Maybe I'll have to fork over for a misting system..."
1,Awful,"The product is a total waste. I thought that other bad reviews had other, more expensive catchers in conjuction with this making it not work. But really it just doesn't work. It's been plugged in for a week and it has caught 3 mosquitos, while 8 feet away there are literally hundreds of mosquitos at my barbeque patio. It is a total waste. Get something else."
2,Major disappointment!,"It's great that Fianna is finally available by herself and not with a set. However, as with the Funk Out! Nevra, Fianna comes with clothing already available from the Bratz Style It! collection and the fall 2003 fashion packs. This doll deserves 2 stars for fun for, how much fun is a doll with clothes you already have? Fianna herself is beautiful, however, she will be patiently waiting for a new wardrobe that all of her friends don't already have! I hope MGA Entertainment considers re-releasing Fianna and Nevra in similar ""punk"" styles as the rest of the Funk Out! line. In the meantime, check out the ""Wild Life"" line for much cooler clothes and accessories for both Fianna and Nevra."
4,Into to Modern Classical Music,Philip Glass and David Bowie get togather and make some wonderful music. It was the music that turned me on to classical.
5,My Scene Hudson is Gorgeous!!,"I got a really good deal on this doll (...). The sad part is that I believe mothers don't really buy the guy dolls. Hudson comes with a duffel bag, a tray with two hot dogs and two drinks, sunglasses and two tickets for his date. Plus he has a great outfit with jacket and accessories. I bought one of each for that price you can't go wrong."
2,"Great Music, Horrible Remaster","The reason this CD sounds so poor is because it was poorly remastered. The original LP tapes were used because the person who remastered it was too lazy to find the best quality sources for each track like they did with the DVD. So what they did was to use an old LP master, and they bathed it in so much hiss reduction, everything sounds like it's underwater! This might be one of the worst sounding CD's I've ever heard and it's NOT because of the nature of the original recordings. It's because of a poor remastering job!"
4,Indescribably Delicious,"KORAI OROM is a Hungarian collective of musicians (ten or eleven) creating some of the damndest ethnic/space/progressive/metal/soundtrack rock ever unleashed. (Yes, I know that description is confusing!) Each of their three CDs to date - this is the best of em - is a 70+ minute single untitled piece split into seven or eight standalone 'sections' which flow and merge in and out of each other and run the gamut from hypnotic ambience to furious aggression. No vocals to speak of, save for the occasional spoken word or pagan chant, but plenty of exotic ethnic instruments... along with guitars, keyboards, flutes, bass and drums in a seamless and otherworldly blend . And it's definitely 'rock', to boot. If you're a fan of Porcupine Tree, Gong, Tangle Edge or Saddar Bazaar you need to hear this. Roll over Beethoven, and tell Bela Lugosi the news."
1,This Game is not out yet,"Ok first of all, this game ain't out yet. Second of all this isa role playing game. you can't customize any car you want. the grand turismo is the OG game of tricking out cars. second of all need for speed underground is the first game to have trade mark aftermarket parts for real cars visual and performance. so bottom line I am not wasting my monney on this."
2,skip this one,"This has a nicely varied assortment of projects, not just wearables, but it is nothing too fantastic-- car lot pennants? Placemats? They may be celebrities, but they arent doing any mind-blowing design. Another problem with this book is that some of the projects require a wide-spread crafting knowledge (screenprinting and crochet) and the supplies for those things (screen and ink, squeegee, etc) which could get a little spendy. the wearables are not that cute or inspired (applying rows of snaps, embroidering on the shoulder? children could have come up with this stuff. check it out at the library first. This wasnt at all what I was looking for, but it might inspire you. It did have great photos."
4,Great knife,If you like big knifes this one is for you. The knife is heavy and appears to be well made. Out of the box the knife will shave hair from my arm. The handle did have a crack in it (small one) upon arrival. Other than that I would highly recommend this knife. I gave four stars ONLY because of crack in handle. Other wise it would be a definite five star rating for quality/price.
5,This is a great knife!,This large knife is made very well and is comfortable to hold. It is a great knife just added to my husband's collection. We constantly look for well made knives to collect and will purchase more like this one.
3,good but missing,i really enjoyed the season but missed some of itmy dvd package which was wrapped had 2 disc 3's. I am missing disc 4. therefore i didnt get to see 4 episodes. unfortunately i no longer have the information of the person who sent it to me
1,if you want to own a REALLLY expensive set of coasters......,"This box set is the ""jump the shark"" of the series and features the infamous haircutting episode. The whole second season was a disaster that sent the show into a downward spiral. The show was retooled to change it from a quirky college drama into a primetime soap. Instead of rich compelling storylines about college classes and a young woman's journey of self-discovery in those four years, we got the start of the shallow will she pick Ben or Noel storyline? Felicity fornicates with the artist guy for no reason and the aforementioned infamous haircut. This was followed up with even more bizarre choices for the characters: The black chick sleeping with the professor, Ben has a kid by another girl and Julie turning into a basket case. Sean getting testicular cancer. After this the show got unwatchable and the network knew it. That's why they kept moving it around. Avoid at all costs. Get season one ans stop there."
4,"One of the best, but some drawbacks","Ive had this particular hood for two years, The visability is great and the hood is exceptionally balanced. Its very comfortable, the weight of the hood is distributed evenly and it very rarely flashes out when you have your sensitivity knob adjusted corectly. Equipped with everything from telescoping head band (to fit safety equipment under the hood ie; respirator), grind mode function,sensitivity switch,5-9,9-13 shades which are good for Mig, Stick,tig and Air Arc. Comfortable head gear.The drawback(s): the outside cover lenses are very pricey (15.00 or more for 5). If you work in a lot of crawl spaces like i do, the outside controls can be damaged. Ive already lost the shade knob once. If your going to buy this hood, buy a welding hood bag to store it in when your done...this hood is best suited for the fabrication shop welders or mechanics."
3,My List of Demands,"Some too-often recorded songs are included in this package and sent me as a kid racing to the rhythm and blues and rock and roll that was emerging. If they ever have a compilation with ""My Cup Runneth Over"", ""It Only Hurts For a Little While"", ""You, You, You"", ""Man With the Banjo"", ""Moments to Remember"" (the Four Lads notwithstanding), ""Naughty Lady of Shady Lane"" and ""String Along"" perhaps with ""Tammy"" thrown in, somebody call me. I don't want to sit and listen to my arteries harden and to songs dozens of people in the 50s recorded. Your folks didn't leave the Ukraine for this, guys."
5,interesting,Allister Crowley was a very eccentric dude. I've been a fan of the RWS deck of tarot for the past 6 yrs and recently learned Crowleys Toth deck and wanted to know more about where he was comming from with some of his card interpretations...Very interesting!
4,bright and white,i LOVE crest night effects! easy to use and you can totally see the results rather quickly. people have actually commented on the whiteness of my teeth. just make sure you allow the paste to dry thoroughly before closing your mouth! great product.
1,Buyer Beware!,"The pictures on the box make it seem so easy to use - but buyer beware! This product would not stick to my teeth regardless of how thoroughly I dried my teeth beforehand! The product dried immediatly after dispensing it from the tube, not even giving me enough time to brush it on a single tooth before it was a dried icky blob of goo that wouldn't stick to anything but the brush and my fingers and lips! I wasted 3 out of 14 packets just trying to get one successful application with no luck. Three nights and 7 packs later, I still have had no successful applications.When I did try to smear the dried up blobs on my teeth with my fingers out of desperation and went to bed, I woke up with lumps of this gross stuff floating in my mouth! No telling how much I had swallowed in my sleep! Ick! It may have wonderful whitening effects if you could somehow find a way to glue or tape it to your teeth!"
4,Pretty good.,Just another westside cd. Nothing really special. If you like that west coast nwa rap then pick this up. Otherwise you probably wont like it.
1,ehh,"Delivery and product condition were great. Movie itself was semi-interesting, but the ending awful. Basically an anti-abortion movie. Very disappointing."
1,Not what I expected,This movie is listed as English Sci-Fi. Well what I got was foreign jibber jabber drama. Someone needs to update the listing and change the language from English to Mandarin/Cantonese with English subtitles.
2,Insibid light and 'fluffy',"How disappointing for someone accustomed to more creative and exciting music. I love well done electronica and American Indian flute, but this is not very original or moving. This is insipid light and fluffy, very boring."
2,"Cute, but...","Temping by Hope Tarr, is a decent book, but it seem that Ms. Tarr really did not give that reader any fresh material. You had the young innocent girl, the hadsome rich man, a older woman who is able to turn the young innocent into a lady in under three months and of course the evil cousin. This is a story that has been told many times before.This book could have been alot better if Ms. Tarr had done more with the plot."
3,Pattern less fashions How to design and make your own fashions,Thank you. I have the same comment as the one above. It was not well outlined with the beginner in mind.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!,"We received this cooler as a wedding gift from my father. Unfortunately, he didn't read the reviews before buying. It worked well for about a month. Then, it wouldn't hold it's temperature. Then a couple months later, we noticed a black oil like leak under the unit. It turns out it's the refrigerator oil. It's actually supposed to be clear. Black indicates a bad compressor. Not only is this a piece of crap, it will cost more than the unit cost brand new to have it shipped off and repaired....even while under the 1 year warranty. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,"Be realistic, people...","I bought this cooler in January 2008 at Target for $50 on sale. It cooled scores of bottles of wine in its 2.5 years of life before it stopped cooling last week.I don't think $20 per year is too much to pay to keep my wine cool. For those of you that it only lasted 1 year or so, that is the risk you run for purchasing the cheapest thing you can find. Accept it for what it is and suck it up. It you want top quality and many years of service, spend the money to get that level of quality.Be a better customer, people."
1,Horrible Product,"If I could give this less than one star I would. This product was a wedding present and it worked for about a year. At this point, it cools to 60 degrees, but no lower. I am disappointed in this product because I have other Emerson products that have worked for years."
1,Do NOT buy this!!,"I had one of these for a little over a year, just as a temporary cooler for a few of my high end wines at home. Unfortunately, life happened, and I forgot to replace it with something of higher quality. A year later, the humidity went through the roof in the cooler and molded all of my wine. Tonight I poured roughly 800 bucks down the drain and through the unit in the trash. Buy something you can count on."
1,wine holder,"If you want a metal box to hold 8 bottles of wine then buy this product, but don't expect it to cool wine for more then a few months. Mine has a blown fuse, but no where to get parts. Out to the recycle bin."
4,THE QUICK AND THE DEAD,"THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, GOOD DRAMA, AND SAM PLAYS A MAN THAT GOES AFTER WHAT HE WANTS. A MUST HAVE. A GREAT LOUIS LAMORE MOVIE."
4,good movie,I bought this for my dad for christmas we watched it the next day picture quailty was good shipping was ok.It was a good buy.
3,If I solve this 1 problem then I'd rate it 5 stars,"All the features I have tried work well. It is a complete package and was bought as a backup for my duplex laser printer, fax, and copier. The problem I have with it though is the power consumption required for completing a printing job. The unit draws so many watts to print that it shuts down my APC power surge/battery backups and turns off anything connected to them, like my computer. I bought a new APC and distributed my computer and peripherals between three units, and plugged the Brother into its own unit (that makes 4), and it still blows the fuse when I try to print. I hope tech support is reading this. HP printers preheat their laser print head to acheive both a quick print out and a lower power surge. So beware...otherwise for non print jobs, I like it."
2,So Annoying!,"I read so many good reviews that I wonder if I am the only one that is having trouble with this machine!!? I use it primarily as a copy machine, and inevitably the pages get stuck time after time.......it has taken up to an hour to copy 10 pages due to having to open the back and pull out the paper that continually gets jammed! (not to mention all the paper waste!)"
3,pretty good,"It could have been a great book if it hadn't been for all the obscene language, and talk. The B-word was used pretty often, and it can be offending. It was a great book in other ways, though. Like a well devloped charcter, though I think that the author spent way too much time focusing on Cameron's parents, and family. Who cares about her mother being a photographer, and her dad a peditrician. Who cares?"
4,Bundle of Joy,"Bundle of Joy is a classic that pairs Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds in an unusual relationship. Fisher and Reynolds were actually married at the time and Reynolds was pregnant with their first child, soon to become famous actress, Carrie Fisher. The movie's theme is interesting but the plot is a bit slow, however, Fisher and Reynolds have excellent rapor and harmonize beautifully. The singing of the two stars is what makes the movie special."
3,Cute so far,"This hamper is really cute. It matches my son's nursery bedding perfectly. However, I was disappointed to find that the fabric is NOT yellow as pictured."
4,"Great show, good DVD","These 13 episodes from the long-running HBO series have plenty of the bells and whistles that make Arli$$ so much fun to watch: celebrity cameos, topical satire, swatches of deep poignancy, and pure silliness. My big problem with the DVD is that it was an odd assortment of shows, from 7 different seasons, I really liked the shows but would have preferred them in a season format."
4,"A good guide, with limits","A good guide to finding mentees. Especially strong are the author's thoughts on the opportunities for older women to be used of God through Titus 2 ministering to younger women. No perfection necessary; merely a love for God and a desire to be used by Him. An excellent book, written in a format that makes it easy to finish in a few hours.One critique: the author grossly neglects the subject of single women. Her book is filled with ideas, stories and Bible study suggestions that are aimed solely at wives and mothers. This one-sided focus may have been relevant many years ago, but feels outdated and exclusive today."
3,Plastic Stylus for Palm Zire 71,They worked pretty well tho didn't fit quit as well as original due to fatter head. In any event I no longer am able to use Palm as battery went dead & I lost everything before I had a chance to retype stuff into my new iPhone 3GS.
4,Nick Diaz Returns!,"The best thing about this two event set is seeing Nick Diaz return to the Octagon. UFC 138 was an excellent event overall and I thought that despite the hype of Diaz's return the card itself overall was decent. Ufc 138 doesn't have any of the normal bonus features like the countdown show, the weigh-ins, or behind the scenes but Ufc 137 has all the normal bonus features in this 3 disk set."
2,review for pablo,"Not one of my favorite translations. Sounds a lot better trying to read it in Spanish. It is not so much translation, but i feel there could have been a better topic or another author that could be translated."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"Great battery. Good price, delivered quick. Cheaper than buying local, if you can even find the right size."
5,Arthur Rocks,We love Arthur. Marc Brown never ceases to amaze me and my family with his choice of topics for Arthur's adventures. Such well written stories with good morals. Kids's of all ages seem to relate to the stories. We have been reading them since my daughter was 2 1/2.
2,not the most cohesive Bruckner 4 by any stretch of the imagination.,"There must surely be more exalted examples of Karajan's Bruckner.This peformance practically grinds to a halt and will confirm most peoples worst prejudices about this great composer.A good example is the 2nd subject of the ist movement which is lethargic and soupy when set alongside Celibidache (incase you were wondering, i'm NOT a Celibidache fanatic!) and the Swedish radio symphony Orchestra.This music needs to drive forward and it rarely does in Karajan's hands."
3,Character's are a bit unbelievable,"This book kept me interested, but I had a really hard time with Charity's character. It was really unbelievable to me that Charity would be so religious that she is weary that her Aunt Susannah is ""courting the devil"" although Susannah is a very sweet and caring woman, and yet Charity is drawn to hanging with a group of girls who gossip, cast spells, ask her to lie, and ask her to steal. It just doesn't fit and was very frustrating for me to read. If you're going to make a character who is very firm in her beliefs, you can't stray from that! It was just very ridiculous to me."
1,"decent printer, when it works","i have had nothing but trouble with this printer. in most cases it will draw in the paper, jam and never print the page. the printer has done this since new, in the year i have own it, i have gotten about 5 pages to print. avoid this printer"
5,Oren Cobb: A Portal to 'Nam was excellent.,Was an excellent book and kept my interest. It was well written
1,!4 days to QuarkXPress,I tried to use this book as a teaching guide for beginnng students. There were a lot of inconsistencies. For instance the instruction would not yield the expected result.The book did not even explain the measurement palette until very late in the chapters and it made assumptions that the user already knew something about Quark. This is not a book for a beginner to desktop publishing.
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was a Jackie Chan flick, but he appears only for about 1 minute in the WHOLE movie. The story is just OK. It does not compare to ""Supercop"" which is better. Do your credit card a favor, skip this one."
1,Case scratches the phone and may be worse than no case at all,This case actually scratches and destroys your pearl. The inside is very rough and uneven; pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone. The phone doesn't provide any protection on top. I really regret buying this ... my phone is all scratched. Get a soft case that stays on permanently. Pass this one up!
4,birth of the battleship,"The title of this books suggests that it covers the detailed design history of the 11 classes of British capital ships laid down during the time frame indicated. However, this is not the case. Instead, it deals with the underlying design philosophy, economic, political & strategic, which determined the characteristics of these ships.Much of this background information is new and interesting and there is some semi-detailed design information on a few of the ships. In addition, the photographs are numerous, large and for the most part well reproduced although they deal mostly with theADMIRAL Class. Hoever, anyone looking for really detailed design histories of the ships in question will have to look elsewhere."
2,I dunno....,"maybe it me. It doesn't sound very creative or compelling. There are so many other great Ra discs that move me, this one seems kind of boring, and, rare for him, dated.Although, driving to the supermarket early one morning for milk, bleary eyed and foggy-minded, it came on and sounded pretty good. Otherwise, I have too many other Ra products to care much about this one."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I bought these to replace similar mugs that lasted me 7 years. They arrived promptly. Perfect for anyone who likes their drinks ice cold, without having to add ice. They turn clear when frozen solid so you know they are ready to use. Only complaint is that they ship with a large sticker on the side that leaves the worst residue I've ever dealt with. 20 minutes and a couple ounces of Goo Gone and they are clean and no longer sticky though."
4,I would recomend it,Good sizeGood materialspace well distributedNice lookI gave it four stars because the pc protector is not very safe.
4,Where to get filters,"I got tired of cleaning the filter that was falling apart, so I went to find an alternative one on line. I actually found one at Walmart made by Sunbeam. Sunbeam makes a Universal filter that can be cut to size. There are two in the box, but cut perfectly in half to make four filters for our unit. They have a charcoal backing and an indicator strip that tells you when to replace the filter. The box cost $8.00, which for us comes out to $2.00 a filter and they do not fall apart!I love the unit and I think the white noise it makes helps my daughter fall asleep.I hope this helps those who had trouble finding filters."
3,"Worked fine .. but no filters, as the other comment","Bought this a while ago in longs drugs store. But couldn't find the replacement filters. Hard to find; available only online. Also this humidifies only small rooms; also even on small rooms, if you are used to run the heater to maintain 68-70 F during Winter, with this humidifier your throat still gets dry. So if you are about to buy, I would suggest you buy a common brand like Vicks, so you get replacement filters everywhere."
1,How do we say Jet engine,I have had many humidifiers through the years even larger multi-area units and never one as loud. It says ultra quiet.... Only if you are comparing it to a jet engine.... The first night it was running I had family members coming to my room asking what the awful sounds was... And it was on the lowest setting. The highest setting was way too loud but on low it didn't really give out any mist.... That is what a humidifier is suppose to do. I wish they didn't make you rate this with any stars... it would be better if they let you put in numbers...Like negative 5
1,No filters & noisy,"Like the other reviewers said, I had trouble getting replacement filters and it was fairly loud. Eventually you will need the filters. I could only find 1 store online that offered them and they were not cheap. With the ""American Cross"" label I thought I was getting a quality product. Apparently that was not the case..."
5,Excellent overview of historical perspectives over the years....,This short piece by Ruth Henig is a masterful and concise examination of the different schools of historical thought over the past nearly 100 years as to the origins of the Great War. Henig gives a brief overview of events that led up to the outbreak of World War I and then devotes much time to how and why historical assessments of the causes of the war have changed over the years. From the immediate aftermath in which blame was initially tossed around to the interwar years to the breakthrough historical works of the 1960s and 1970s.I'd recommend this for both avid students of the Great War as an overview of different historical perspectives and for those just starting to learn as a good starting point for understanding how and why this catastrophe occurred.
5,The Mini Nuke Conspiracy,"A great historical account of how South Afric obtained nuclear weapons with the help of France, Germany, United States, England, and Israel and why they develped these weapons. It also deals with the phenomena of ""Red Mercury"" which was used by the Nazis in WWII and attempt by world wide terrorists to obtain this material."
4,Now 25 Hits,"Good CD. Most cuts are tight.Shipping was free and ok. It was slow to arrive, and took 10 days."
1,Doesn't work with any of my bluetooth headset.,"I bought this product thinking it would be a deal but, now I'm furstrated. It doesn't work with any of my 4 headsets. Motorola, Plantronics, Sony, and a different Motorola. Terrible product."
2,Short broadcast range,I have had mine for 2 years now and it work fine with the Jensen Headset. Now I find if I am more than 2 feet away from it I lose my connection. It is now a nice peice of desk clutter.
1,Jensen....don't waste your money,"I was very excited after purchasing this device, I would finally be able to transmit all my music to my stereo w/o a bunch of clumsy wires. Yeah right....the WBT420 refuses to pair with my brand-new macbook, despite my anguished efforts to find a way. I wouldn't bother with this device, you buy cheap you get cheap. Check out the Iskin Cerulean or something of that sort, this product is a waste of your time.If anyone else has experienced the same problem with this device and a macintosh laptop equipped with bluetooth, please let me know any tips you might have for getting this little f**ker to work."
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE COOKBOOK!!,"This was a wedding gift for my husband and me, who love to cook. This is a good balance of both meatless and meat recipes. We have learned to cook so many different ""beans and rice"" recipes that are delicious - and the ingredients match the basics we have in our pantry. We have often resorted to this book for ""last-minute"" dinners when we haven't been to the store or made up a menu. Our kids love the recipes, since Ms. Urvater thoughtfully mentions ways to work in milder versions of many recipes. Finally, the ideas for leftovers that follow many recipes are invaluable. I would highly recommend this cookbook and is a favorite one to give as a gift."
4,Great Recipes,I had bought this book with intent to use it when I moved out on my own. When I married I pulled out the book to find new recipes because all I knew how to cook was rice and my husband only knew how to cook macaroni and cheese!It's great! My husband & I went through it looking for recipes that sounded good. The directions are straight-forward and there's no guess work at how long it will take to cook up a meal. We'd be home from work by 6pm and eating by 7pm. We'd take turns cooking and even my husband can follow the instructions. There are tips for what to have in your pantry and what type of pots and pans and utensils you'll use more often.I highly recommend this book to people that are just learning to cook or for those people that love home cooked meals but don't have a lot of time in the evenings.The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I have found a couple of recipes that didn't come out right or just didn't taste right at all.
2,First time in 14 months that we perfer Huggies,We have been a Pampers family since the moment our daughter was born. The hospital gave us the Swaddlers newborn and she wore those until she hit the Cruisers. She's become very interested in the potty training and our doctor told us to go ahead and give it a try. She's doing pretty good at it so far but with no help from these!They are a total pain to get up and down for her and us. We have to fight to get them up and then they fold into themselves and make it impossible for her to get down. And if she goes in them they are even worse. They sag worse than a cheap store brand diaper! She's even had they fall off of her after only one accident. And they leak like crazy if she does have an accident.We just weren't impressed with these at all! We tried the Huggies trainers that can go on and off like a diaper and she's doing great in them! We honestly look for her to be totally potty trained by 18 months!
5,perfect for diaper changes standing up,"My daughter almost never wants to lie down for a diaper change. She's much more interested in standing up and seeing the world. This drove me crazy (and near tears of frustration a few times) until I discovered these. They are easy to put on and take off (the sides tear open easily). Plus, they are just as absorbent as a regular diaper. They were a little big in the beginning (when she was 16 lbs), but now at 19 lbs, they fit her well. I've even used them overnight with sucess."
4,The moving baby,"The Easy Ups are great for a baby on the move. Sometimes we have a hard time getting a diaper on our 11 month old son. He just won't stay in one place for more than a second. The Easy Ups are easy to put on while he is moving. There is one set back, they do not hold much. Naptime and nightime wear are out with this diaper."
2,just ok,"Brackets are kind of useless....not sure who decided to include 1/8"" thick inch grill with a bracket that would better suit a grill that is a half inch thick....other then that the grill itself is what I was expecting....not bad for the price and the delivery was on time. Made of steel so that's nice....and they look cool."
4,ok- I suppose,"Haven't installed it yet, but it looks solid and all the parts were there (no screws though- don't remember if it was advertised as having them or not). Came loose in the box, but nothing broken or bent. Strong plastic smell, but not an issue if your subs are in the trunk."
1,Oh my God I have nightmares about this thing,"This is the worst piece of crud you can buy in anything, anywhere. When I first got it I thought it was defective so I sent it back and got a new one. That one was even worse. It has terrible reception. A microscopic organism can completely block the reception on this thing. It often quits in the middle of a game, and turns itself on and off. I don't know how in the world this even made it on the shelf. It is so bulky and ugly, and after just one month all of the symbols on my buttons (X, O, etc.) were completely faded. The rubber was ripping off on the grip, too, and the controller became sticky and more annoying than it already was. One day I became so angry I just tossed it in the trash can. I didn't regret and I didn't come running back; I just left it there.Buy a Logitech cordless action controller. There is only one place for the Lynx Wireless Controller and all Madcatz products in this world of ours: the dumpster."
3,Good album just doesn't hold up to previous efforts,I'm a big fan of Suicidal. I'm ok on there most recent efforts even though they're a little too Infectious Grooves sounding too be labeled ST. This has the sound of a band enduring some hardships and I think it's the last one with Rocky George who is in my opinion someone who brought a lot of musicianship to ST when they needed it. Trujillo brought a lot but he wasn't ABSOLUTELY essential to the early sounds(although he's still one of the best hard rock/metal fingerstyle bass players IMHO. All in all it's a solid effort just doesn't hold up to earlier cd's.
5,an indulgence from childhood,"I must start with a warning. These can be addictive and metabolically dangerous.When I finally again found chocolate halvah not marble, I was transported back to childhood experiences of delight.These are good with the right amount of oil and a non-overwhelming chocolate flavor. And they are not expensive and delivered promptly."
4,good value,"This stand is pretty doggoned good for the price. It was so easy to assemble - no instructions required. It is sturdy - doesn't move or shake when using it. The adjustment knobs are pretty cheap, and it is difficult to get the sliding pieces 100% secured. They stay in place when using, but when I compact everything to put it away, and stand it on end, I cannot get the slide arms to stay closed. It doesn't have wheels, but they are not necessary. The unit is plenty light enough to be carried with ease.Overall, I am glad I got this stand, and love the price."
3,Nice design but not best quality,"This stand is fairly well designed but cheaply made in CHINA. The Rollers came with all kinds of scratches, scraps and poor chrome finish. Not too happy about that but it still works and price is reasonable. Don't know how long it will last considering the lack of craftsmanship in manufacturing but OK for now."
3,chinese construction shows,"I purchased this stand to mount my new Hitachi miter saw. At first I was impressed with the construction of the stand itself. Before I could finish putting the pieces together, I had a problem. One of the set screw knobs will not work because the simple hole is stripped out. Why couldn't they weld a nut to the bracket to use as the threads... Chinese junk. My frustration begins because I cannot find a contact number or website anywhere in the operator's manual. For now I'm at a loss. Probably weld a nut to the bracket like it should be."

3,Ok.,Just another westside cd. Nothing really special. If you like that west coast nwa rap then pick this up. Otherwise you probably wont like it. note: I suggest the unedited version if you want to be able to understand it.
2,whatever...,"If you like long periods of pretentious and obnoxious noise of the no musical ability variety punctuated by all too brief moments of actual beauty, by all means order this now... this guy needs to learn how to write songs BEFORE applying the jeff mangum fuzz pedal to everything ...(!)... I'd rather listen to Stankonia..."
1,Waste!,"I was very disappointed with this e-book. As another reviewer wrote, the lack of a table of contents makes it practically useless--unless you want to read page by page by page...in hopes that you might eventually happen upon what you want. This is a rip-off, even at $0.00! I can order a used hard copy for less than the other options, which is exactly what I will do after deleting this book. I wish I had read a review before excitedly adding it to my kindle."
5,Very Good,"Hopkins is a great wordsmith - unfortunately, due to the ever-changing English Language, it is not ""easy"" reading but it is certainly worth the extra effort.George"
1,Product never received,"I never received the product. I advised the company. They seemed to attempt to resend it, but I still never got it. I did however get a refund."
4,Mr. Revere and I,"Mr. Revere and I is about Paul Revere told from the perspective of his horse Sherry. Sherry goes through three owners, the last her favorite. She expierences what it is like to be the horse of a Patriot. We enjoyed reading this book because it includes humor, facts, and sometimes even suspense. That is why we recommend this book to other kids."
4,Munchkin auto seat protector,Very very nice. Fits in both of my cars with ease. My seats are protected from all my child's messes. I absolutely love it!
5,Good seat protector,Seems to be a quality piece and work as advertised. No problems w/ dye bleeding to backing noted. Mine has a tan backside. Liked it enough to buy another.
4,Does its job,This product is fine for cloth seat protection but it is not stiff enough to protect against dents/stretching of leather seats. It's does just what we needed it to do in our Civic but we chose something more substantial for our other car with leather seats. Love the flap that covers the seat area in the front of the seat where our daughter often steps to get in and out of her seat and where her feet dangle while in it. No mud and dirt marks left behind!
4,Good desk reference,"I just got a copy of ""The essential dictionary of investing and finance"" and I feel it is a good book to refer back to since it is filled with useful terms in several categories such as bonds, stocks, general investing, mutual funds, etc... it even covers some technical analysis terminology.I believe that this book will be really handy whenever I am reading something online or in other investment books/publications and don't know the meaning of the word.The guy who wrote this book (Jerry M. Rosenberg) sounds very interesting. He's a professor at Rutgers University's Business School and he has authored 28 books (most of which are business related dictionaries.)I believe this book is a really good addition to my library and will be an excellent desk reference.Reed Floren"
4,Develop your skills as a historian,"This book is an excellent guide for people who are either new to or trying to improve their skills in researching and writing about history. It includes information on discriminating between sources, proper annotations, proper writing styles, and much more. There is also a very good bibliography at the end of the book with many further resources by excellent historians. If you want to research and write about history, this book is a great place to get started with developing the skills you need."
2,mySAP ERP for Dummies Reads Like Ad for mySAP,"I've read several previous ""... for Dummies"" titles and found them to be full of useful information and well-written in a simple, straightforward style. However, I was surprised and disappointed by this title. It's short on solid technical info and long on cheerleading for mySAP. As an example, the authors are constantly touting web services as though they were a panacea. The book does give some justification for why they're useful in the ERP systems context but web services are not magic. As a software developer who uses web services every day I know better.The book has lots of examples and case studies for how companies can benefit from using an ERP system but it has precious little in the way of details as to how they work or how you might configure a system. For the reader looking for a high-level overview specifically of the mySAP ERP this might be useful. Even then, keep in mind that the book is an unabashed advertisement for the software."
3,ERP Challenges,"The challenge with any ERP book is for it to be informative without being boring; technical with out talking over the reader's heads and thorough in its breadth of ERP. Whie I am not a fan of the ""Dummy"" books, the first few chapters are good for those who have no idea what ERP even means.For the die-hard ERP project manager, however, there is not much in here that you do not already know or have not experienced. Some of the advice it gives I learned on projects myself, but other pieces of insight I would not suggest. If you are doing ERP and need to create strategy and work with developers, stakeholders and architects, there are better manuals out there.Also, I found it to be a bit light on the project management side, since I feel that HOW you execute a plan is sometimes more important than WHAT you execute. It is all about perception and the successful ERP project is as much about generating interest and excitement as it is about solving problems."
4,great wipe,"Working in the bush is a filthy place so it is nice to have some thing to disinfect with, great for office and doors a well as hands."
2,"Entertaining at times, Unbelievable at others","I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story."
5,We love it. So cute!,"I got this for dry food for 2 cats. We had two of the smaller ones for canned food.The quality of the material and painting is excellent! It looks beautiful on the mat. The cats love it so I got one (with hearts painted) for water too. It has the perfect weight and size. When someone sees the two bowls on the cat mat, I don't have to mention I love my cats!"
1,Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection,"How disappointing. The rating is not based on the films- four of the five films are incredibly fun and full of lunacy- it is Universal's half-hearted effort that is really a let-down. For that studio to re-release them in no better condition than they were in the late-90s releases is insulting. No effort was made to find better film elements, the extras are pathetic (they would've been fine as part of a larger collection of extras) and ""Duck Soup"", one of the top 100 American Films of all time, doesn't even merit a commentary track!Compare this shoddy work with MGM's labor of love from earlier this year on ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"", and Universal's effort looks darned poor.Universal needs to hear from Marx Brothers fans, too. The Brothers deserve better and so do we."
4,marx brothers best,"The best films by the ""Marx"" brothers. ""Coconuts"" is the only film that is pieced together and some spots are very poor in clarity. All other films are excellant reproductions, very clear, good audio and the best of the Marx."
3,Not nearly as much fun the second time around.,I guess I remembered only the hilarious nuggets from when I saw them many years ago on the big screen.
3,Retired Army Flag,"The Retired Army flag is adequate for occasional use, not for permanent outside display. The fabric is lightweight, but workable. The vendor was prompt with delivery as promised."
3,Norelco Battery,"Need to have solder/desolder skills to install battery into shaver. I used ""wicking wire"" to remove solder and things went well. Not for the novice! On the good side, after installing battery the shaver worked like new."
3,painkiller and the bugs,"great game, but buggie software and the 1.3 patch dont work.wait a few more months then look for updated patch.The game turns itself off and all the computer geeks say dont buy it."
4,A slaughter,"Having played the demo:+++Good things+ Original Weapons (a stake gun, how sweet :))+ A dark and squalid atmosphere (nice marriage between the detailed textures,the fog and the music)+ A lot of monsters, like the old-fashioned doom-like.---Bad things- I would like our avatar to go faster (used to Unreal Tournament) for a fps like this (not a prob with my config, it was not lagging, I play with a p4 2.4ghz, ati radeon9800, 1gig Ram)- Not that original (very quake1,2-like), seem to lack some story (but that could get more interesting in the full game I guess)- It's a killing-rush, nothing smart really as in a Half-LifeTherefore I give it a 4 stars.-1 because it's not that original, and 4 as it is seems very well developped."
1,Inedible,"This jerky is inedible. You would have to reconstitute it in beef broth to be able to chew it. Additionally, all you can taste is the hickory smoke and salt. It might be leather for all I know. I purchased several other varieties from this manufacturer, and they are all of similar poor quality. Avoid."
3,Tooo Salty!!!! But great customer service!,"The meat taste way tooo salty that it feels bitter in my mouth even with small bite. Check out their 1.4lb jerky, much better than this.UPDATE: I was contacted by Choo Choo R Snacks and they offered to replace this pack with one of my favorite (more expensive) at no cost to me which i gladly accepted. They said if you don't like it, contact them and they'll make it right. Other reviewers mentioned the saltiness is only with this new lot, so check for their update when you order. Thanks Choo Choo, i will buy again!"
1,AWFUL!!!,Tastes like it was soaked in soy sauce and THEN smoked!!! This one hit the trash can the first night!!!
4,"Great service. Good, solid beef jerky","This beef jerky is good and solid. I use the word solid because it is not moist. The heat also overwhelms the smoke flavor (at least for me). I will definitely consume this, but will buy another flavor next time.I've also tried the original flavor which is very good and moist and the barbecue, which is very moist and absolutely delicious.If you like your jerky chewy with some fire and some smoke flavor, buy this!"
4,"Good, could have been much better","I was hoping this book may give some insight into Metzger the person and Metzger the spiritual being. Instead it is a set of experiences related to his life as a scholar, which is very interesting reading in its own right and I recommend the book on that basis, but don't expect much insight into Metzger's inner self, apparently he can't even ditch his scholars cap when talking about himself!"
2,A little scary,"Music is a little scary ""freaky"" to my daughter (10 and not easily scared). I told her that's the way dolphins communicate and she liked the truth and science of that, but it doesn't quite work for calm music..."
3,Not too bad...,"I own all 3 movies subbed as well as a majority of the SM Japanese TV episodes. THe DVD of the movies are so much better than the VHS. Nothing is cut out, the theme songs are the original ones, they're just overall better. I enjoyed this movie as much as I did when it was subbed except for one thing. The Outer Scouts voices were horrid. Sailor Uranus is supposed to be more ""masculine"", c'mon the girls think she's a guy at first! Sailor Neptune is supposed to be more ""feminine"", a complete contrast to Uranus. And Sailor Pluto is supposed to be more ""mysterious"". In the subbed version, she barely whispers her attack and transformation...not shouting them. (and btw - it sounds MUCH better subbed....I don't know who did her voice but it was AWESOME in Japanese! ) So, in whole, buy the DVD, put it in Japanese for the Outer Scouts :)"
4,Subbed or Dubbed?!?,"The S movie was okay, even though this movie was mostly a soap opera in the dub. The subtitled had a more...of... the action although it didn't have much... It did have the outer senshi but they had like 6 lines. The animation was the second best leaving Sailor Moon SuperS the best anime. This movie fetured Kakeru, and Hemiko, two star-crossed lovers. But to affraid to say it...it had about 20 minutes of action and had some nudity... I mostly choose Sailor Moon R, and SuperS for the first see."
3,"Not the best SM movie, but still above average...","This may not be the best SM movie, but it does have great things going for it. First, it's much, much better than the horrid DIC series version. The voices are much better. Besides that, this is a great way for North American fans to see 3 of the Outer Senshi or Soldiers, Sailors Pluto, Uranus, and Neptune, who still haven't debuted in the states. The animation is also great, and we see Luna as a human. While the plot is so-so, this is still worth getting, and the plusses do outweight the minuses."
4,A Good Sailor Moon Movie,"This is a good movie for any person to watch. I has action, romance, and comady. It has the Outer Scouts. All the Sailor Scouts Transformation. Even though this movie has a little bit of nudity and some boring parts I am going to buy it when it gets on the market but buy The Sailor Moon SuperS Movie first. BYE BYE"
4,Sailor Moon Super : Luna's Love,"The Sailor Moon Super Movie, my favorite video, is a great move for girls. Luna cathes a cold, and walks home by herself. In the middle of a road, she faints, and almost gets hit by a car, but Kakeru saves her. Kakeru is suffering from an odd illness, and Luna wants to know why. Meanwhile an Evil Snow Witch, Princess Snow Kaguya, appears. The inner and outer scouts (exept for Saturn)are having a hard time against, and just can't beat her. The ending is pretty stupid if you ask me, as well as the Dubbing if you ask me. If your kid is 10+, I suggest the Subtitled Version due to quality reasons. But kids nine and under should stick to the dubbed version."
1,Bad! Bad! BAD!,"The English Dubbed Version of this movie [dtunk]. Yes, it did [stink]. I'm not kidding. They changed the following things in the dubbed version of this movie:1) All the music (except for some) were replaced with the DIC music cues.2) Everyone pronounces Princess Kaguya's name like Kah-GOO-Ya.3) Sailor Chibi Moon's name became ""Sailor Mini Moon"".4) Sailor Uranus' voice is too high-pitched.5) Sailor Neptune's voice is too old! Serena (Usagi)'s mom isn't a good voice for her...6) Sailor Pluto sounds like Britney Spears.7) The Sugar Stars (those things which Kakeru gives to Luna) are changed to ""Star Flakes"". (Sweat Drop)8) The Snow Dancers sound like annoying yapping dogs.9) Luna's HORRIBLE voice doesn't match her human form.AND MANY MORE!Don't buy this tape! If you're a Sailor Moon fan and saw the Japanese Version, don't buy this tape! Stay away! Buy the English Subtitled Version instead!"
2,Not as good as R or Super S...,"This movie was kind of weak. When I first bought it it was the only one of the three I had,so I really liked it (especially the outer senshi). But after I bought the other two it wasn't very good in comparison. The plot is suprisingly weak for the usual Sailor Moon and it almost completely revolves around Luna. It's also VERY predictable. All of the senshi get to use all of their attacks equally, the newer ones in the first battle and the older ones in the last battle. It reminds me of a whole season summed up in two half hour episodes. The music is nothing to brag about, either. Moonlight Destiny is a very good song, but the rest sound like a scifi movie from the sixties (unlike SuperS, which had wonderful music with lots of emotion). If your out to collect all three movies or love Luna tons, then by all means buy this movie. If your out for music and a good plot, I reccomend SuperS or R."
4,Interesting movie,"Luna gets a bit of the spotlight here, and this movie also features Sailor Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto all in action. The Sailors must unite against a evil snow villain. I can't say that this movie was the best of the trilogy, but it's still a good one for any die-hard Sailormoon fan."
5,it was soooo cool!,"I'll have to admit that my sailor moon spirit was sagging a bit-(gasp!) after all, theres only so much a person can take of DIC's chopped up version of sailor moon. but the second this movie started i must say i have never been so enthusiastic about sailor moon before. the animation is terrififc, the plot is very original, and i love to hear the japanese dialouge. a must have! sailor moon forever!!!!!"
3,average rating. not as good as the other movies,"In my opinion, R is the best (which a lot of people agree), and I think Super S comes in second place. If you don't have any of these movies I'd say get them in the order of R, SS, and S. If you're a big fan of luna, than this movie is for you. She's so much cuter in this movie, than any of the episodes (japanese or dubbed), when she falls in love with kakeru, a human. In this movie you get to see her transform into a human. I think the visuals are great, and if you're only familiar with the DiC, i'll have you know that the japanese are 583618 x better than those. And You actually get to see the outer senshis in action, which you don't get to see in the series in the U.S. I think the outers' attacks are so much better. But all in all, this movie comes in third place."
1,Mini Moon?,"I own the subbed and dubbed version of this movie. Ket me say that I found alot wrong with it. Several scenes were cut from the dub. They named Sailor Chibi Moon Sailor Mini Moon. For one thing Chibi means Small or Little not Mini! Is it just me or does Mini Moon conjure the thought of the movie ""Austin Power the Spy who shagged me"" in your mind? Also the seiyuu for Uranus is all wrong. The seiyuu is too feminine. If they keep that seiyuu for episode 93 it will ruin the whole episode. ALSO (SPOILER)I don't want to ruin it for anybody but does Pioneer? There's a scene from Episode 200 of Galaxia in the opening credit."
3,My review...,"I have been trying to get this video for ages, and I finally did. Whew. It was rather good, all the old voices were casted, except for Amara's from the English Dub S series. But, the outer senshi only have about three lines anyway, so it does not matter. Serena's voice was a bit difficult to understand, but I still liked it. The ending was kind of lame, there was no great music playing, but I guess it does not matter to much. There is a romantic scene between Serena & Darian, so that was wonderful to see!! I recomend getting the R movie -- The Promise of the Rose -- first, esp if you are a Serena & Darian fan, and the ending was *much* better. Well, that is it!! You can email me if you wanna chat about it."
4,Sailor Moon S The Movie-Hearts in Ice Review,"This movie is pretty good. Believe it or not, Pioneer did a much better job on dubbing the movies than DiC did with the episodes. This movie has a good plot, with lots of excitement. The Sailor Soldiers find out that the Ice Princess is going to freeze the world, and while this is happening, Luna falls in love with someone. Only problem is, LUNA IS A CAT. The scouts, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and of coure, Sailor Moon, are joined by the outer scouts Sailor Neptune, Uranus, Pluto, and even Mini-Moon to help fight the evil that is planning to take over the world and freeze it. A wonderful family film as well as for kids who love Sailor Moon and anime."
5,Uranus? Neptune? Pluto? Yeaaaaaaaaaah!!!!,"I love the Outer Sailor Soldiers!!!!!! You people out there that are only familiar with the North American version of Sailor Moon, you are missing out on so many good things!! From the three movies, R is the best, but S is the second best because of the Outer Sailor Soldiers!! The third one, SuperS isn't bad either, but it's a little....iffy! o.O Anyways, why are you still sitting there? GO AND BUY THE MOVIE!!!!!!! ~_^"
3,Sailor Moon SS is better!,I saw the dubbed version of this film and I feel a little disappointed. This is the first time I'll recommend the DVD or Subtitled Edition of a Sailor Moon Movie or Special. The movie is a short lived classic but it is still collectible to watch off and on. There I said it.
5,This is a great video,"You should get this, it is a great movie and I great for a Moon-ahalic. My fav. Part is when they use Silver Crystal Power it's just so bright and proud in a sence."
2,Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Ruined,"Well, i watched it, and was very dissapointed. The essence of the original was totally lost. The outers were just awful....They're supposed to be cool. And what's with them being all ditzy and everything? That's not supposed to happen! My reccomendation is to get either the VHS subtitled version or the DVD dub, that dub is somewhat tolerable (plus it comes with the subtitled version too! ~_^), but don't get the VHS dub, this goes for the R and SS movies too."
3,Sailor Moon Stock Footage! MAKE UP!,"All three of these films could share the same review, changing names and plot points. If you like Sailor Moon, you'll enjoy them. If you don't, they won't win you over. If you like stock footage of transformations and attacks, this is the film for you! (Sailor Moon S has the most stock footage of the three, Super S, the least.) Do yourself a favor, and buy Kiki's Delivery Service or Maison Ikkoku instead. (However, for fans of the series Sailor Moon, these are must-haves.)"
1,C'mon Now Folks,"Rips her eyeballs out because she thinks there are ants behind them. Honest. just like the description says. This movie is very close to being a contender of the ""Don't Look In The Basement"" Award of lousy, insane inmates films. Rent it. It's probably in the cheap aisle by now. I applaud anyone that gets behind a camera and makes movies. The trouble is most of todays filmmakers are into the 'torture porn' school of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, I like a good horror/blood 'n guts film. The key word here is ""good"". Sorry folks, one star is all I can give and believe me I wish I could give more."
5,Great Regency Voice,Kate Huntington has one of the greatest Regency voices today. I love all of her books.
4,Alcoholism and Addiction Cure,"I really enjoyed the author. Chris Prentiss has been there, so his view is real. This book gives hope to a close friend of mine who is dependant on alcohol. The fact that you are in charge of your life,you, not alcohol,is a fresh look at your future."
1,Advertisement,"This is terrible, it's all about the authors son. When listening to the audio book his wife had a big drug problem(no suprise there) Never cured her. After listening to it made me want to drink more."
3,Wondering,"An alcoholic for 15 years, the 12-steps don't work for me because I don't want to turn my life over to a religious cult. I sobered up using Rational Recovery, but it was difficult to say the least.I saw an info-mercial for this book, and found some of it helped me even after sobriety.It was great to finally read someone de-bunk the ridiculous ""disease"" idea!It wasn't a disease that put the beer to my mouth, it was my hand."
2,Very general in nature.,"I bought the CD's. Really they talked a lot about the son, but not about the therapy or cost. I am leary when they use the word cured. I know a recovered alcoholic, and he still says after 15 yrs the craving is there, but he learned to overcome it."
5,great book to help you when you cannot afford a rehab,This book told me what I need to know to deal with my problems. This book makes a lot of sense. I think that if a person works through what is in this book they will be able to get well. I am a lot better after reading it and putting some of it to work.
4,A different way to look at addiction,"This book is very inspirational, especially if it is you who are fighting drugs or alcohol. It gives a very different way to look at addiction. It is not traditional 12 step which is something I rebel against. Instead it has you look at your addiction from the reasons of why you abuse drugs and alcohol. Most traditional treatment only addresses addiction as the problem, but this book points out that addiction is only a symptom of your underlying problems. It gives the author's 3 step approach to digging deep to solve your addictions from the underlying problems. The author runs a treatment center in California that has a higher success rate than other treatment centers. The book also has the author's son's addiction story and how this plan has worked for him."
4,Compromise,As other reviewer I too was concerned over the box and minimum of packing used. Fortunately there appear to be only cosmetic blemishes to the fence and underside of the table which still seem to have been inflicted during shipping. Ran a few pieces thru it and it cuts as promised... very strong and smooth. If you want the free table that is now thrown in with a new saw for an extra $100 I would go for the new one.
1,"Cheap and terrible, dont buy","This product only lasted to the 2nd bottle I tried to open with it. Its cheap and terrible, you are much better off just getting an old fashioned wine opener at the liquor store, what a rip off"
1,flimsy construction,"The operation works fine, except after about 6 uses one of the plastic grippers that holds the corkscrew to the bottle came off.Some people with skillful fingers might be able to reattach it, but I couldn't. Poor construction.Vacu Vin Twister Corkscrew Gift Set"
4,As Advertised,Works as advertised. Compact and light. Good to take along on picnics or in the camper. Would recommend to a friend.
4,Great little Corkscrew,"I purchased this Corkscrew after breaking my favorite OXO corkscrew that i had for forever.I really didn't want to spend a lot of money on this product because I have a fancier bulky one, but tend to like easy access to the one in my kitchen drawer. So, I ordered this Vacu Vin Twister Corkscrew.When I opened this up it seemed like a very cheaply made product, but I didn't want to go through mailing it back so I threw it in the drawer and that was that. Until tonight! I took it out to use because a glass of wine sounded like a good way to end the evening. I was amazed and happy at how easy to use and accurate this little gadget is. I now have a new favorite easy-to-open corkscrew and this is it.The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because I am not sure of the durability yet."
3,Such a tragedy this CD is not on a harpsichord,"This CD contains dynamics, phrasing and embellishments on the piano, not the harpsichord. They are done very well but they have interspersed and overlaid the 20th century with the 17th."
2,Unusable,"This product is impossible to use. I bought this one bacause of the travel case, but later found out that the DMW one has one also. I would not recommend this product. It is easier to use your fingers than this tools."
2,Not very useful...,"I must admit that I was very excited after finding this product. I was skeptical when it came to buying it, as there were about as many negative reviews as possible ones. But, I decided to go ahead and purchased this product hoping that it would help with more of the removal of my contacts, especially since I have very long nails.After receiving the product, I found myself agreeing with one particular review that the tips are way too soft that it was very difficult to hold on to the contact much less take it out. Also, the instructions provided by the manufacturer are very confusing.I am giving it two stars for now, as I think that I may go back to trying this out in the future, and hopefully with enough practice, this may theoretically work. For now, I found that even though I have long nails, using the middle fingers of both my hands to pinch and take out my contacts has been an effective way to removing them. There are some very helpful tutorials online."
2,Item missing,"I received this product on time which was great. When I opened the box, however, the packaging was open and there was an item missing from it. All I have are the tweezer which work great and the case. The insertion/removal tool was not in the package."
5,No go without it!,"When trying contacts for the first time, I found that I didn't have what it takes to stick my finger in my eye to remove them. I purchased this tool from Amazon after a little web research and finally was able to remove them. I cannot use my contacts without the tweezers to remove them. I do not need the insertion tool so I cannot give my opinion on it."
1,"Short on information, high on opinion",The beginning of te book gives some nice timeline facts. But the book quickly descends into a fact devoid propaganda piece.
4,Intriguing & thought provoking presentation.,"The authors build a framework to expose, possibly the most, perplexing usages of technology in the 20th century. The reader would rather discount the implications revealed as science fiction, but the authors provide documentation, patent numbers and references. Questions are raised about the impact, not only on the environment, but the inhabitants of this planet. Left me seeking more information on Tesla and validation of his genius, and wondering where one could locate shelter if this experiment goes askew."
4,A must for all who are concerned about their planet.,"I found this book very well written. The research and bibliography was excellent. All the information is very well documented. This is a must for those who really want to know what is happening on this planet. My one major comment: If you do not like documented and verified information,you problably will not be able to get thru this book. I would refer you to Dr. Begich's next book, 'EARTH RISING' It is a sequal and very readable for the non technical person."
2,Pointless,"1995's Village of the Damned is almost a shot for shot remake of the 1960 original, the only difference is the location moved from England to northern California, and in a nod to modern-day gender equality, the child leader is a girl.The only reason this was remade was to show-off better FX and for gore and shock value, i.e. unneccessarily showing the results of a poor guy who, during the blackout, had the misfortune of standing over a lit grill.You only need watch the original, this remake takes you no where the original didn't.And the DVD is pretty much barebones."
2,Too tight,"I purchased one of these about a year ago, and it's been sitting in my closet for about that long. The belt is amazingly tight... so tight, in fact, that shorty after starting an exercize program with this piece of equipment I had to see my doctor and discovered something in my knees was swollen.When I mentioned this product and how it worked, we realized this thing was aggravating my knees because the belt was so tight I had to pound on it to keep it moving! I used almost an entire bottle of WD40, and that didn't work. I put it in the closet and took up martial arts again instead. You get what you pay for, and my knees are still sore thanks to this.I gave it two stars because it's relatively inexpensive, convenient, and a space saver. But if you have knee problems, I highly recommend purchasing a product with less stress on the knees."
1,Afraid of being blasphemous,"Perhaps this movie means a lot to those deep in religion, but to a non-believer like me this is just a sort of poorly done religious propaganda with little artistic value. Zeffirelli admits himself that he felt so thankful to God after he survived a terrible car accident that he became a born-again believer. Therefore, he wanted to thank God and church for the miracle that happened to him by doing a movie on a religious subject. Another example of how a lack of critical approach turns out a poor, tasteless and boring cinematographic creature. Scenes that are supposed to be uplifting and inspiring appear just outright stupid and grossly overdone with tear jerking and sugarcoated vulgarity and banality. No surprise that it is not a very well known Zeffirelli film - he would not become famous doing some dull and dumb productions like this. The soundtrack is horrendous. I would not recommend to those who are looking for artistic value rather than a sermon."
5,"A gentle, warm and innocent experience","I first saw this film on BBC1 probably around 1984. I was 13 maybe 14-immature and a little volatile and yet I sat with my mother and watched the whole of this film on a Sunday afternoon. I never forgot the experience-the sunshine,the scenery combined with the innocence of the sound track(truly beautiful in itself-what a shame Donovan's version was never released).Having grown up ,moved on etc I came upon this film again a few years ago, for sale in London.It has become a good friend and having taped the songs onto audio tape Im currently playing the title track to my unborn child via headphones pressed against my wife's bump!Ok I may sound like Im slightly over doing it but no other film has had such an impact on the way staggered thru my life.Here's to love and compassion and this film is the essence of both."
5,A Truly Inspiring & Unforgetable Video,"This is one of the simplest videos ever created. It has a bad sound quality, no special effects whatsoever, but; It is the most touching, inspiring and unforgetable piece of art that melts deep with your own feelings.For those who have already started their spiritual process, this movie brings to life sensations from within, and emotions that makes you realize the path you are taking.And Ofcourse! the music is really magnificent...It's a story from the heart, for the heart!"
5,response to Mari,"I have to say that I fully agree with Mari on the similarity between Sarah Jessica Parker and the poor child sitting inside the dilapidated chapel. When I first saw ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"" this person immediately caught my attention as being someone I had seen before. Needless to say, Sarah Jessica Parker was the name that came to mind. Although I know for sure that it isn't the same person, I can see where the confusion would be..."
3,Fantasy with a minstrel sound,"Even though the story lacks a truth in history, it does reflect a movement of spirit. The intimacy of this spiritual journey may not have been Francis' as he was known to throw himself into a thorn bush whenever sexual desires got the best of him. But, the idealic world of the director has us all hoodwinked into thinking that Communism is our only way of human salvationi. What if this movie were done in the 90's...Brad Pitt would star as a burned out soldier boy who is called upon to be a holy and politically correct individual who struggles against government and organized religion to bring God into our lowly human state of technology and spiritual wasteland. I suppose it would be akin to Seven Days in Tibet. By the way, does anyone know how to get the soundtrack to this movie?"
1,Unforutnate purchase,"Unfortunately, I didn't see that this was a region 2 dvd...in all the years thatI have purchased dvd's have never come across this problem. I cannot play thisdvd on my computer or home equipment. Next time will look very carefully beforepurchasing. The company has been communicating with me, however, it isn't costaffective to return these dvd's"
4,inspiring but lacks some essential elements,"the movie is one of my favorites. it is inspiring, shows the passion by which st. francis did all for Christ and more importantly how he embraced this life.however, the movie was too artistic in some instances, sacrificing most of the supernatural aspects in st. francis' life. also, his ""object of love"" was not fully developed to give the audience understanding of his passion. the probable problem with that is a misunderstanding of who st. francis really is.despite that, the movie is still a worth watch. it carries inspiration and a reminder of st. francis' life. it is however a requirement that the reader read further on st. francis' life and not rely on the movie alone in understanding who he is."
2,Borrows more from metaphysics than Pentecostal/Charismatic theology,"Though some Charismatics have found this book insightful, I found it very lacking. The author leans less on Pentecostal/Charismatic theology and more on what appears to be metaphysics with maybe some New Thought.Her treatment of the 9 Charismatic Gifts was lacking and went in a different direction than Classical Pentecostalism. Her thoughts on tongues were devaluing.The author appears to rest more on Catholic Mysticism which is very different than what I was looking for. Typically a book of this title would be from a Charismatic or Pentecostal perspective but this is without a doubt from a completely other direction.Some may like it but I found it lacking biblically."
5,What a pleasure to support this book!,"Although not a recent publication, the message is timeless. A Catholic woman discovers healing abilities and helps many people. She reveals these skills wonderfully so one may walk away feeling empowered to practice healing too! Although she poo poos the New Age, we're doing the same thing....I am a REIKI Master and I think Agnes is where I got my first training. Bless her! God's Light cannot be contained in a doctrine! Linda Schiller-Hanna Reiki Master/Clairvoyant"
3,Sound out of sync on several songs,"I can only add to the previous review that this is a shoddy product. It does give something of an overview of Wetton's stage work that is useful, but, beware, there are several songs in which the music is very much out of sync with the visual.I agree -- good to rent, but not to own. Check out AMORATA if you want to see the elder Wetton with a good band (though still not up to his 70s/80s work, by a long shot)."
5,These techniques saved my relationship!,"Julie's work is amazing. When my husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, her techniques literally saved his life and our relationship. If you or someone in your life has bipolar disorder, this book is essential for you! Julie understands this issue first hand and communicates her knowledge brilliantly. I would recommend this book to everyone!"
4,Good start for anyone looking to learn more about morality,"This book is a very good, junior high to high school level textbook concerning morality. Its modern approach gives a realistic basis for morality. Although presented from a Christian perspective, any religion will find its message worthwhile."
1,Very disappointing,"As the title suggests, this book was made for the intent of helping students build a conscience and understand deeper concepts of morality. However, the book is very slanted. It contains many editorialized sections and fables composed by the author, which inevitably discourage considering any ideas contrary to Mr. O'Malley's understanding of morality and the conscience. Editorials are made worse by the juvenile and scathing way O'Malley writes, both glorifying his own ideas and tearing down contrary ones. I normally have no problems with an author taking an opinion as long as an opposing viewpoint is given its own credit, thus allowing a student to form his or her own convictions, but this was clearly not done. Unless a reader agrees with the ideas in the book, he or she will most likely find it difficult to read like I did."
4,Great Classic Comedy!,"This is a great romantic comedy from the early 1950's that will make you laugh all the way. The two leads are superb, especially William Holden, whose role seems very modern. If yo like romantic comedies, this one is for you!"
3,BEWARE: DVD may not play in your PC,"This is a witty, completely charming romantic comedy. David Niven is at his best. Beware, though. I was very disppointed to find that this on-demand DVD-R will not play in my laptop DVD player/recorder. Nowhere does the Amazon web site warn about this, but the packaging bears the following warning: ""This disk is expected to play back only in video 'play only' devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"".I frankly think it inexcusable that Amazon does not tell you this before you buy. I give the movie four stars and Amazon two, for an overall rating of three."
3,Maggie McNamara,"This movie shows a promising actress Maggie McNamara. She got nominated for best actress and remains a mark as the only person in that category whose career didn't go anywhere. ""The Moon is Blue"" was put down by the Catholic Legion of Decency because it said the word virgin. Frankly screwball comedies of the 40's were just as suggestive so I don't get the deal.The connection between this movie destroyed Maggie, right at her career's beginning. It's a shame because Maggie is very cute in this. Afterwards she went on to star in the boring, ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" and the cheesy ""Cardinal."" Her stint in Hollywood was then done and she worked as a secretary for the rest of her life. While the movie comes across as stagey, it's worth seeing it just for her."
2,at least she allowed kris to sing PARTS of a song ...,"this is a movie about a fading rock star (kris kristoffersen). in the first 15 minutes of the movie he goes on stage drunk & stoned and sings some songs. then some broad shows up. then kris gets drunk & stoned some more. he might even sing a song, i forget. this keeps happening, but every time the movie starts to get interesting, this same broad keeps sticking her (very big) nose into the story. i kinda like kris kristoffersen, but then he dies (oops, spoiler), and believe it or not THEY KEEP THE BROAD AROUND! now if she could act (like janet gaynor) or sing (like judy garland) -- i might understand. but all this broad can do is chew scenery & fool millions of dupes into considering her ""the greatest star"". twaddle."
5,A Star Is Born (1976),"I purchased this movie before Christmas, received it promptly and watched it with my daughter the following week. She loved it and had remembered it from her childhood so I gave it to her and ordered myself a new one...I love ordering through Amazon.com. I take advantage of ""free shipping"" whenever I can and love the convenience of ordering online."
2,Babs - A Star Is Born,"The 1976 remake starring Barbra Streisand is dated, corny and toatlly enjoyable. It's hard to tell if I loved it due to nostalgia, or because it's fun seeing the way she looked in the mid seventies. That voice, those clothes (from her closet due to budget reasons, right) and that afro. Jon Peters produced the movie and her hair...if you like Babs, you'll love revisiting this entertaining remake."
3,post-hippie/broadway kitsch,"when this came out, i saw it my first time at grauman's chinese theatre in hollywood. that memory is far better than seeing this movie later as an adult. at the time i thought it was the greatest achievement, now...it's bad in an entertaining way, and far too long. kristofferson is excellent, and streisand is alternately compulsively watchable and fascinating, then over-the-top wrong. god, this movie needed an cagier editor- it might have been better, even good. still, the star-is-born moment of streisand passionately singing a mediocre song, ""woman in the moon"", is fun to watch. but the vanity production has so many ""gorgeous"" close-ups of la barbra, it's scary and funny at the same time, and achieves that rare quality, classic kitsch- ""ms. streisand's clothes...from her closet"" is one of the funniest credits in film history!"
4,Sentimental favorite...,"I bought this movie because I was feeling nostalgic and thinking of my first girlfriend. It was the first movie I took her to see. But watching it again, I realized what a good movie it really is. Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand play well off each other. The story carries you along watching his failing stardom and her rising star. Star-crossed lovers, what could be better material for a movie? Now if I could just do something about Streisand's politics...."
3,FRANCISCO BASTARDO (SINEPINAVI@HOTMAIL.COM),"CON ESTE PRODUCTO ESTOY NO MUY SATISFECHO, POR CUANTO LA TRADUCCIÓN DE LAS CANCIONES NO FUE HECHA, Y NO ENTIENDO MUCHO EL INGLES HABLADO, EN LA PELÍCULA QUE ""VI"" EL AÑO 80, APARECÍAN LOS SUBTITULO DE LAS CANCIONES......... ¿QUE PUEDEN HACER PARA SOLUCIONAR ESTO A FUTURO?"
3,"Not great, but interesting","This movie is not by any means a GREAT film, but it does has its strong points. Kristofferson hits a bullseye as a hard drinking washed up rock star, and though the music they selected for him to sing is not that great (why didn't they let KRIS write some????), he gives it a sort of authentic charm, and most Kris fans should find it listenable. Other than ""Evergren,"" which is a great song, Streisand's songs in the film are mostly pretty bad, and she lacks feeling in this role. In fact, the major downfall for this movie is that Kris is so believeable in his role, and Barbra is not. It creates a sense of unbalance. Perhaps they should have let Rita Coolidge play his wife? At least then the roles would have been more balanced and the film would be considered historically more important (Rita does appear for a few seconds, with Tony Orlando.)"
5,A Star is Born - Great Movie!,This movie is a classic. I wasn't old enough to watch it when it first came out but I must say this movie could have been released this year and it would have been great also.
1,Garbage,"This movie makes me embarrased that I too,was a child of the 70'sNo Led Zep,Stones are here folks.Just an awful Streisand trying to convince us that this was the rock of the 70's.We all know better."
2,A remake of a remake,"This film makes me recall a rather infamous episode of my life. I wanted to take a date to see ""Rocky"" in the theater, but she insisted on seeing this movie instead. Just like my date, this picture turned out to be a dud. Because it's loosely based on two previous releases of the same title (one starring Frederic March and Janet Gaynor; the other featuring Judy Garland and James Mason), the plot is uninspired and predictable. As for acting, both Streisand and Kristofferson should stay in the recording studio. The only redeeming feature of this film is Streisand's performance of her hit song ""Evergreen""."
1,Faulty DVD- does not play well!!,Though we opened what seemed to be a brand new DVD it does not play well;skipping frequently and making it difficult to understand the dialogue.
4,Still Good After All These Years,"'A Star is Born' was one of my all-time favorite movies back in the day. While on a cruise recently, the performers did a tribute to musicals and they featured songs from the movie. Naturally, when I got home, I had to watch it again. I still love it just as much, and I still cried like a teenage girl at the end. 'A Star is Born' is one of those magical movies that reflects the mood of its time, yet transcends that era as a timeless love story.An interesting aside: I remember watching 'A Star is Born' way back when and thinking that Barbara Streisand's wardrobe was so classy. At the end of the movie, the credits read, ""Ms. Streisand's wardrobe from... her closet"" I thought that was the neatest thing, and I still think her clothes were just gorgeous in the movie.A definite ""must see""."
2,Fly Fell Way Below the Earth and NEVER came BACK,"WOW! I've never read a more engaging book that engrossed my mind about so many cliched, sentimental aspects of life! It was amazing the way you were able to pull readers in with your callow vocabulary and drama rama, mama! Keep up the aspiring work and maybe, just maybe, a Nobel will be knocking on your neighbor's door!"
4,cute little bike basket,"I bought this to go on my granddaughters new Dora trycycle. she loves it, the only problem is the basket is hard to attach so that it stands up straight. We had to use wire to set it straight."
5,1 of the best albums ever & 1 of the most underrated bands.,"Some of Us is simply a masterpiece. Who wants to listen to a different combination of dynamics, such as dub, ska, reggae, metal, rock, world music and so on...you should check Some of Us and PRIMITIVE REASON. Their latest album is THE FIRESCROLL and it's even better than this one. So if this is 5 stars, imagine what THE FIRESCROLL is... check some sounds at: www.primitivereason.org"
2,Not happy.,"I ordered an XL vest. I received an XXL vest -- twice. The retailer, however, was very apologetic and was quick to refund my entire purchase price + shipping. They even paid to return the two wrong-sized vests."
3,"A little cheesy, in a good way","This reminded me of very bad sci-fi movies they used to show on b&w TV back in the 50s on Saturday afternoons. It was made in 1974, but could be from 1954. Talk about ants marching! The dialogue is silly and there's really nothing very scary here. Still, I enjoyed it."
4,Phase IV look out for the Ants!,"I enjoyed the movie that I first saw as a youngster. But the ending was still as disappointing, even with the added years to gain more understanding of life. Oh well!"
5,DVD RELEASE NEEDED,THIS IS SIMPLY A SCI-FI CLASSIC THAT needs to be released IN DVD...NO GIANT ANTS HERE..BUT THE STORY IS A WINNER.THE ENDING WILL BLOW YOU AWAY....SO PLEASE GIVE US A DVD RELEASE.
4,somewhat exciting!,"The book was somewhat slow at first. It was an enjoyable book however. I wish there would have been more of a storyline though. It just didn't give me all the excitement that I usually enjoy getting when I read romeance novels. But, I do recommend this book."
3,"eh, this didn't really do it for me","Let me start by saying Miike is a genious.but this one wasn't that great. The violence was great. The charachters were pretty good. The story was o.k. And the ending was friggin awesome until the very last thing that happens. I thought that that was garbage, but thats just my opinion. There are probably so many people that think thats what made that movie so great. I can see what they're thinking. but... not for me"
3,Violent Search for Belonging...,"Dead or Alive is an extremely violent and disturbing film by Takashi Miike who also directed the challenging Audition (2000) and alarming family drama Visitor Q (2001). In this film Miike tells a story about a gang of young reject Chinese immigrants who are ""lost"" in a foreign society. Under the leadership of Ryuichi, the gang attempts to regain their position in society by creating their own place, which becomes a dark area in the criminal world. In their search for belonging, they openly display their insolence for authorities and the Yakuza, since they cross paths. This leads the gang members onto a bizarre and sadistic path. Dead or Alive is definitely not a film for everyone; however, underneath the gross and ugly there is a distinct message in regards to society. This message enhances the cinematic experience, but there are several cinematic infractions besides the brutality that hurt the overall cinematic experience."
4,Flies well,"We went to the beach and flew four kites, including this Skyfoil and another pocket kite. This one is very stable and easy to fly in the mild breeze. My son got it in the air by himself. Once it was up, it did not require any work to keep it up. The length of string was comparable to most of the other kites along the beach.When done, the whole kite and string fits right into a little bag, which is small enough to fit into a purse. The trick to getting it into the bag is to roll the kite tight around the kite string cylinder, put it in the bag and stuff the tail into the cylinder. My other parafoil kite fits more easily into the bag, but this one was not impossible to stuff back in."
5,Bocelli's Verdi,"As a long time admirer of Andrea's voice, I was really looking forward to this CD. BUT, nothing before had prepared me for how INCREDIBLE this music would be sung by Andrea! His ability to reach the heart and soul of the listener is second to NONE.I DO listen to many other tenors, and while some of them maybe be technically better (except in the area of diction, where Bocelli reigns supreme), not one of them has moved me as Andrea does.If you like Andrea or Verdi, even if you don't... this CD is wonderful!"
1,Not a happy camper,I had ordered the wrong product. I returned it to American Wholesale and have not received a refund or any contact with them. I reordered the right product which I did receive and was happy with the product.
5,Great product,I wear gas perm lenses and this product works much better than the other products I have used. Lens stay cleaner and fog free all day.
5,Great collection of music for poppers (electric boogie),"These tracks bring me back to the '80s vibe of music, poppers used to dance on these tracks in the playgrounds, parties, and block club parties throught out America. Now I'm beginning to see the revival of the '80s dance crazy. If you're a popper, locker or breaker, this is a nice collection of old skool tracks that will keep you dancing until the break of dawn."
2,not really,i wasn't impressed with this product at all. I took it with other things and not much happened. I take tribulus and it works better than this and Lonkat
4,Comprehensive but perhaps too broad,"There is a lot of depth to this book, then there is a section on retaining your subconscious to lose weight and quit smoking. This book seems stuck between the secrets of the universe and self help. New Agers will be happy to find the chapters on the human Aura, Psychic Energy and Healing. Those seeking enlightement are going to like the chapters on Detachment, Meditation and Finding the True Self. There is a terrific exercise on detachment (IMO). This book also has a pretty comprehensive description of ""Conscious Creation"". There are some good exercises in this book but for the most part I didn't read anything in here revolutionary or that I haven't read somewhere before. The book does agree with texts I've read prior and perhaps its value is bringing many topics together in one place."
3,An Okay CD,"I have listen to this CD and I can't say I'm too impressed with it. It starts off okay, but after a while all the songs start sounding the same. The music has an earthy, new age sound, with James Wilkinson doing some mildly interesting tunings and notes. I recommend it only if you're looking for some background music or a different guitar sound."
3,It was just OK,"I liked Jennifer Howard. She seems to be very knowledgeable about the body. What I was dissapointed with was the fact that the DVD is primarily for begginers and that information was not stated anywhere on the DVD. She talked a lot throughout the video as well. I wished there were more exercises and less instruction.Finally, hopefully this has been brought to her attention, but there are SEVERAL typos on the back cover."
4,It`s good and makes its work,we have used in this tags in several trips and it`s cool to see your luggages on the rail in the airport and identify it easy and fast.
3,for diehard Bill Haley fans,The picture quality was awful but I really was not expecting much given the recording date. It will remind you of footage taken with an old 12mm camera from the audience. However the excitement of Bill Haley and His Comets is there nevertheless and worth having if you like Bill Haley.
2,"Gives an earful, but only one!","This radio gives a ten dollar sound for ten bucks. It must have been designed back in the 70's, and here's why. Sound from the speaker is OK, but when I plugged in my good pair of earbuds I only got one earful. Spent the next half hour roaming the house looking for an old fashioned mono set. Found 9 pair ranging from expensive to ones that I've walked of of airplanes with, but none of them worked. Don't even know where you could find a pair of those things these days. I guess Sony must have found a few hundred thousand of these antique radios stuck back in a warehouse somewhere and decided to unload them at a firesale."
4,Sony ICF-S10MK2,This has a good sized to put in my pocket and good sound quality. I use very morning for walking exersice
3,Can't beat the price. Quality? Well.....,"I hate to be too picky for an item that cost 10 bucks, but I'm not sure I would buy one of these again. It does remind me of transistor radios from the 60's (wish I wasn't old enough to remember that!) But it also reminds me of the quality issues from that time, too.For example, the knobs for the tuning and volume are not very precise. It is difficult to tune a station precisely -- partly because it doesn't get good reception and partly because the knob itself is not easy to fine tune.I would rather have spent $20 and gotten a better device -- if there is such a thing out there.While I am at it, I will give a plug (so to speak) for the Sony ICF38 which I bought at the same time as this radio. Whoa -- I just noticed that I paid $20 for it! I am VERY happy with it. But, it really is in a different category because it is much, much larger. It is not boombox size, but it is not something that you are going to stick in your coat pocket either."
2,Disappointed,"Like other reviews said, only works in 1 headphone so I won't complain about that. My problem was I could not get a decent reception and the volume control is way too sensitive. It goes from silent to ear blasting in the first tenth of an inch. Glad it was cheap, and will be looking for a better radio to listen to baseball. It's sure not 5 a star product."
4,"Nice price, nice radio, quick delivery",This was a replacement for a 1995 Radio Shack model I have used for many years. The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is a somewhat overly-sensitive volume control. But that would not change my general approval of the product - at least so far. We will see if it is as durable as the old Radio Shack model.
3,Touchy,"It's a nice cheap radio but can be difficult to get a clear signals on AM channels. For the price though, I think it does fine."
1,Early Failure,"The volume control became ""jumpy and scratcy"" during the second set of batteries.In other words volume would only start at relatively loud levels and would be scratchy or intermittent at louder levels. I threw the radio away."
3,Start Up of Sony Radio,"There are several things that I am not happy with in the operation of my Sony radio. The major issue is that when turning on, the radio has heavy static which continues until the ""voice"" comes on at a very loud volume. You have to turn the volume down before you can use the radio. The other issue is the volume is located too close to the strap."
2,Can't Use Headphones,When I bought the Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio I didn't realize that it wouldn't work with headphones(The sound only comes out of one side because the radio is designed for earphones)This is probably a good radio but I bought it for my sister to replace her old radio and she only use headphones.
5,GREAT GREAT radio for 10 bucks !!,"I use this radio twice a day on my hour long bike rides.Works great for local radio stations.Batteries last a long long time. I have yet put in a new set.You can't go wrong buying this radio.Trust me. I am a real critical, regarding product reviews."
4,Sony Pocket Radio,"A nice cheap little radio that in some locations actually gets better reception than the radio in my admittedly old car. I haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life. However, as was pointed out in another review, this baby only transmits in mono to earbuds. I rarely use them so that feature didn't matter much to me. I have an older Bell-Howell mini radio with poorer reception but at least the feed to earbuds is stereo."
3,Not Handy for What I Bought It For,"I purchased this radio to take to the Cowboys game with me so I could listen to the play by play while watching the football game. The radio is too thick and podgy to carry in my pocket but I have managed to do so anyway. The volume is not quite loud enough, so I cannot hear some of the broadcast during the louder parts of the game. If you just want a radio to listen to in your shop or somewhere that is quiet, this radio will be fine, especially for the price."
1,Terrible,"Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio, SilverWorked for a week of very little play, it was a waste!"
5,i'm giving these out to good friends for Christmas,"Last Year I bought a Sony ICF_S10MK2 to take on vacation figuring the sun, sand, surf will destroy it, not a big $ loss. Son of a gun worked AAA-Ok and I brought it home to weather 11 days of no electricity due to freak storm here in CT. Worked flawlessly and nearly forever on a pair of AA bateries. The absolute bonus is that it's got better selection and selectivity that 2-3 other portable ac/dc radios I own. Buy this radio for zombie attacks. OPh and it sounds pretty good too."
1,Terrible Reception,"I wanted to love this product -- the reviews I saw were great, the price was right, and it was small and simple -- everything was pointing in the right direction. However, this radio cannot pick up any station I try to tune in to. I live in the New York metro area, and I use this radio primarily within 30 miles of the center of Manhattan, yet I cannot pick up 93.9FM clearly, and I cannot pick up 660AM, 820AM, or 880AM at all. That's basically all I ever listen to, so this radio is completely useless to me. I would be tempted to say that maybe the building I've been trying to use this radio in is somehow blocking the signal, but I know other people in this building who have no trouble tuning into some of these stations with other radios, so I highly doubt that that's the issue. In summary: unless you live within 5-10 miles of the transmitter for the stations you're interested in listening to, I wouldn't bother with this."
4,BobN,This pocket radio works quite well. The reception is great and the quality of the sound is not bad considering the price and size.
2,FAIRLY DECENT,Although this radio performs fairy well (SOME STATIONS DO NOT COME IN AT ALL) the antenna broke after the third day....the broken antenna had nothing to do with the performance it played the same before and after the antenna broke because it is still attached to ther radio but cannot become raised or lowered
5,rose,"the little Sony works wellI just it to carry around from room to room while working at homelight, clean design, compact"
2,used to be a 5 star,"I have been buying this same radio for years and have always loved it - cheap, portable and great reception. Unfortunately, carrying it around the house and yard results in my dropping it occassionally, and thus, eventually having to replace it. I have probably owned at least 5 or 6 of these radios over about the same number of years. I just received 2 new ones and in both cases, the reception is VERY POOR. I don't know what they changed on the inside, but it is not the radio it was. I live 10 miles from downtown of a major metropolitan area and I do not receive stations from the city that my last remaining old sony radio does. Very strange.I am sad and disappointed that I will have to find a new portable, radio solution."
3,A must have,"This radio works wonderfully, but the volume could be better. Plus some stations do not come in very well, but overall, a must have for a small radio."
2,Sony Transistor Radio,In turning on the volume it does not come on softly. When you finally get volume it is loud. Very touchy to adjust sound.
4,Sony pocket radio,"This radio perfectly fit the bill for the price. I was looking for something I could listen to while in the shower that was small enough to fit on the vanity top and loud enough to be heard while the water was running. The reception is pretty good, and the speaker is plenty loud, although somewhat tinny. You don't want to listen to music on this radio."
4,Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket Radio GREAT!!!!!,"I can't BELIEVE the sound that comes out of this little thing.The stations ACTUALLY come in CLEAR,with the antenna up.This radio is great & for 10 bucks you can't beat it!"
1,Not OK,"The description for the Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio made me think it would be a good back-up to the little Sony SRF-37W pocket radio (that works only with phones) that I've been using so well for many, many years. But when the ICF-S10MK2 arrived and I turned it on, I quickly discovered that its headphone jack sent a sound signal only into one ear of my Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Bud Headphones that work fine with many other devices.Of course, there was no mention in the ad that this would happen, so it's my fault for not guessing that, but most mono systems I've ever used at least put that single sound in both ears. The mono isn't the problem, it's that I don't hear that in both ears. But this radio doesn't, so it's virtually unusable since most of the time I listen to NPR shows, I do that by phone since my ears are old and don't hear well.Watch out what you buy. You might get unpleasant surprises."
1,DON'T BUY,This worked great....for two days. Then it suddenly stopped and can't get it to work. I gave it to my husband for Father's Day and he really liked it...just what he wanted...until it stopped working. Now it will cost more to ship it back than it cost. I'm very PEEVED.
4,Good for the Price,"I can't give this radio a 5-star review for the following reasons:1. The reception is not as good as I expected2. The casing feels a little cheap to bear the Sony nameHowever, it's certainly a good pocket radio for the money...it's practical, lightweight, and has a long antenna. FM is better than AM, but that is expected in a radio of this size. That said, it's bigger than many pocket radios in it's class. I like the size, but it may or may not suit you. You can easily place it in a bag or purse, but it may be too bulky to actually fit in a ""pocket"". This would be a good radio to throw in an emergency kit, the car, or to keep with you. And, it's cheap enough to buy several to keep in different locations."
3,tale of two radios,"Why a tale of 2 radios? While one cannot expect to much from a ""pocket""radio, this little sony picks up a lotbut sadly it is filled with staticand noise across thedial. The local AM1240 is fine of course. Also gets AM550 about 60 miles away which is ""listenable"", and 2other 1K stations that can be tuned in.BUT.. at night this radio has a different personality! AM reception and sensitivety is, wellexcellent, and mostly noise free...hard to figure. In other words daytime,noisy, night time itprforms very well. Ihave a cheap $5 dollar Lennox pocketsports radio whichdoes no better in daytime reception than this Sony, butless across the dialnoise. But the Lennox cannot compete with the night time receptionat all. Hard to figure.Bottom line for me? Sucks in the daytime, with noisegalore, but excellsat night. This unitcan get any stationthat my RCA super radio can get duringnight time Am reception. FM...does a great job andgets all 7 in the area the RCA can also.Hope this helpsyou decide."
2,AM reception not particularly good,"I wanted to listen to AM sports broadcasts so I bought a generic boombox from the drugstore. And... the AM reception was not very good. Buzzy, crackly, hissy, and generally annoying. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, indoors, the boombox could get maybe three stations with clarity that they won't give you an earache, and maybe 15 in total. So I reviewed the reviews, and bought myself a Sony ICF-S10MK2.And in a side-by-side head-to-head comparison: the Sony ain't no better than the generic boombox. In fact, it's exactly the same. Oh well.PROs: small size, and it's really cheap. CONs: tinny sound quality (of course), eentsy finicky tuning wheel, and not very good AM reception.I would suggest using this outdoors only, and praying that the transmitter's antenna is within sight.But two stars because it's so inexpensive."
5,Good things come in small packages,"Great price, great reception, simple to use. I have a few of these and use them for different purposes (power outages, going to the beach, casual listening). Nice present for casual AM radio listeners too."
2,Poor volume control,"I really shouldn't complain due to the fact that was a low priced item, but still you would expect it to work adequately.Perhaps I just got a lemon, I did read the reviews and there were quite a few good ones and you may end up with a great radio. The problem mine has is that it goes from really low volume on the dial to really loud,(during the dial adjustments) there is no in between. You would think that being that it has a dial that would not occur, but it does. This was the sole reason for purchasing a new radio, my old one had a volume dial problem also, I thought it was just that make. I decided to buy a Sony thinking it would work pretty well, but the volume dial is the problem, it also makes a lot of crackling static noise when adjusting it. Hope that this helps."
3,works okay,I purchased this radio to have in my classic car. When parked I turn this radio on and get stations. Some better then others but good enough for me. Radio antenna bends easily so be carful. I would buy this again because of the correct price point.
2,Poor dial design,"I bought this to listen to while out walking. The big problem is that the dials turn too easily. Just the slightest brushing against my pocket causes either the volume to turn down or the station to be tuned away from. This often happens just from the movement of my limbs as I walk. The dials need more friction. It's extremely difficult to insert the radio into a pocket of any size without turning one of the two dials.I anticipated the 1-channel problem and bought an adapter from Radio Shack to divide the signal into two mono channels so I could hear my programs (mostly news) through both ears. But after a very short time I found that the slightest bump could cause the signal to cut out. This may be the fault of the adapter rather than the radio--but it highlights the drawback of having a one-channel radio in the first place.Its reception is better than my old Walkman, but still nothing great."
1,Bad,"Bought one, returned it because only the left earpiece worked (my headphones). Checked headphones and they worked fine with another radio. Replacement radio had the same problem. Sony wanted to repair it, Amazon refunded it. Inexpensive, but only wanted to listen to local sports."
3,Sony ICF-Siomk2 Pocket AM/FM.,I tried the radio inside a building and all i got was static. Disappointed with the radio but it looks nice?
5,Excellent,"I am very satisfied with this product, because its performance is great and I have used often. I will recommend it to friends and relatives. really good!"
4,works well and good size,"just the tuning part could be little bit better, little bit more ability to fine tune would been great, some station is so sensitive that its almost impossible to get right on and get good reception. other than it is really good. i bought it for my parents and they love it."
5,great,"Works really well. the AM reception is much better than a big tuner I have with a long antenna. I don't use it much, though; keep it just for emergencies."
4,Good quality and Value,"I was pleased with this very reasonable priced item. There is good reception, easy to use dials and. convenient sized radio."
1,static is pretty much all you get,very poor sony product.the radio is very hard to listen to in either am or fm because of the static. tried indoor s and outdoors without success
5,Powerful pocket radio,Not only did the radio pick up great reception but it also had a fairly loud speaker. It was tedious spinning to get the station but at this price to be expected.
2,earphone problem,I bought this pocket radio because I wanted to listen to the radio while I was at the gym working out.The pocket radio has a very nice sound with the integrated speaker but when you want to listen the radio with your earphones you can only listen through the left side. That is the reason why I give it a 2 star rating.
5,What a radio should be!,"This radio knocks all other handheld radios out of the water.......and then when you factor in the price, it is the best radio on Amazon. This radio picks up stations that no other device could in my house. Gone are the days of having to go out to my car to listen to my favorite sports show. Way to go Sony!"
1,Ugh!,"I'm delighted everyone else had a good experience, but I am mystified. For me, carrying a loaf of bread in my pocket would have been less cumbersome. And I'll bet the bread would have gotten better reception."
3,OK Radio,"This Sony radio is a good value for the price. It works better than the comparable Sangean and Panasonic. It has better sound than the others, but, with all portable radios in this price range it is weak at locking in a signal, especially if you are moving around."
3,A OK cheapo radio,"I bought this little radio for use on the train to listen to NPR during my hour long commute. It picks up standard FM ok- BUT- as you have to use headphones on the train-the sound only comes out of one of the sides of the headphones.- it is mono- I originally sent the radio back assuming it was defective- but quickly a new one arrived- with the same problem. I have gotten used to listen to the radio with only one ear- Further comments- the sound through the radio regular speaker is ok for talk programs, news etc and marginal for music. For the price- I am pleased - but would have appreciated being able to hear my radio station with my headphones with both ears."
4,Does what you expect,"This is a nice little radio of a type that's been around for years. It does exactly what you'd expect of it. It pulls in all the local stations on both AM and FM with good fidelity, and batteries have a decent life expectancy. If I lost the one I have, I would not hesitate to buy an identical one."
3,Not as happy as expected,"Based on previous reviews I thought this was going to be a great radio. My husband has been looking for something to listen to NPR on around the house and outside. The reception is good, but only on the days in decides to come in, which isn't too often. Other stations come in great, but the only reason we got it... NPR is not coming in too clearly. :("
4,Well written,"The people in the novel are coming to terms with what war does to people. The old veterans who are scared and have given up living through the war, but charge ahead. The new who still think they are invincible. The surviors, who wrestle with why. Good action with real like people who fight wars"
3,Room for a 4th,"I also took a picture of everything I ate from May 29th 2003 until december 31, 2004 and posted it to my website. I think it was the screen savers made fun of me for doing it on one of there episodes. I used my Nokia 3650 Camera phone. Good for him for being getting it out to print. His book has a nice format. It reminds us we could all use some more variety in what we eat."
4,Miracle of The White Stallions,"We saw them perform in October, great show. They wanted $40 for this dvd at the show, more than I wanted to pay. Good story, didn't see any video problems noted in other reviews. Good buy for the price."
5,Cheaper than a specialty wrench,"I needed this for my table saw, which I got second-hand without a wrench. This works. it's a bit thick for that, but I can get it to work. It was cheap, and it will definitely hold up well for my purpose. I won't be putting enough force on it to break it with what I am using it for."
3,"If you like 3/4, this is your recording","One solid hour of waltzes, all kinds of waltzes, played at exactly the same tempo without a hint of retard, rubato, or stringendo anywhere. Waltz until you drop. Great background music, but that's about it. Listen to the individual selections if you really want to hear how they should sound. The usual Telarc sonics are there, of course, but the recording wears on you. You might love it, but it wasn't my cup of tea."
1,Another terrible recording,I agree with the previous comments posted here. It does sound like swishing the bathtub water around.
2,Screw holes not big enough,"In trying to put this together, I had to drag out my Dremel and drill the holes larger so the screws could be screwed through the rail and into the side of the cabinet."
3,Interesting Material - Poorly Edited,"This book - of a regional interest - caught my eye and I'm enjoying it. The characters seem vividly drawn and Sparrow has a knack for describing northern Minnesota. But what is driving me CRAZY is the lack of editing! He has misspelled words (your instead of you're), one character's name is Virginia Burns, later referred to as Virginia Bruns, and his characters call each other by the wrong names. I know this is nit-picky, but it really detracts from an otherwise smooth read. It's making me want to take up a blue pencil as I read this.Why wasn't this book edited - or at least PROOFREAD - better?"
2,Not so good,"I returned this item for two reasons: the sprout is too low, resulting spill when boiling unless the kettle was only half filled. I also dislike the fact that I had to yank very hard to open the lid."
3,decent but w/ defects,"First of all--it's a teapot: how good or bad could it be? Does water get hot in it when it's placed on a lighted burner? Yes. Does it whistle loudly when the water boils? Yes. But if you really like to boil water--I mean *really* like to boil water--then this teapot has a couple defects.First, its circular handle goes directly over the spout as you pour, so your hand can get scalded w/ steam if you're not careful. Second, the spout cap is not easy to operate--you have to flip it to the 'open' position before you pour, and you have to be careful that the lever is not too hot.I'm sure there are better designs out there if you have the time and money. But if you want a decent (and decent-looking) teapot for cheap, this one will do fine."
3,not sure how long this will last,"I purchased this teakettle for my mother for Christmas one month ago and so far I haven't been very impressed. There is a spring inserted in the spout which allows room for the whistler to move when steam pours through. This does produce a very loud whistle, however the spring pops off along with the whistle attachment every time the spout is opened for pouring. Another issue is the recent melting of the spout around the edges. The teakettle has never been left on the burner longer than it needs to boil a full pot but already the spout has begun to melt slightly.I am pleased with how loud the whistle is - it can be heard anywhere in our house when it starts ""screaming."" It cleans well and holds a lot of water. I am just disappointed with how the heat resistant plastic attachments are already melting."
5,This book ROCKS!!!,"Got to say....this book absolutely rocks.It is clear, to the point and not to mention full color!Equally relevant to either a new or current user of Combustion.Being a new user, I have found it very easy to follow and digest.Thanks Gary!-Chris LeventisInstructorInternational Academy of Design & Technology"
3,Who staged this?!!!!!,"I am a great fan of Jonas Kaufmann and adore Schubert, which is why I purchased this ""unknown"" opera DVD. However, in spite of beautiful singing by the cast, I laughed my way through the opera. The staging was ludicrous, the costumes even stranger, and the plot as weird as anything I have ever seen. An actor dressed as Schubert wandered around with a score in his hand, constantly ""editing"" it and adding to the ridiculous nonsense on stage. Next time I watch, I will close my eyes and just listen. Will also stick to Schubert lieder which thankfully has not yet been ""acted""."
4,A Clear Voice is heard again,Don Rigsby again showes us his clear vision of how American roots music is supposed to sound. Listen to his voice on this album as it reaches new heights in his approach to song.
3,"fairly factual, good photos & news accounts","Being somewhat of an authority on the group, I find some claims that are not accurate. Early history & photos are superb, & are mainly due to Mr. Goldberg's friendship with Jerry Daniels. Would have liked more credits listed to the donors, for some items are one of a kind."
2,Disappointed,"A Chinese made USMC flag of questionable quality. You get what you pay for, regardless of what others' reviews suggest. Pay more and get a quality American made flag!"
3,flags,the united states marine corps flags I received were fine for the price I paid. The only rubs were the fact they were made in China (remember the Korean War) and the shipping was over 5 times the cost of the flags.
3,"Nicely detailed, but color scheme is completely wrong","First, this is not worth $50 at all.The toy does not look like the picture--it is painted a light gray with very dark gray squares (aztec-ing) all over it. There is too much contrast between the two colors, making it look like a mottled mess.The picture shows the ship as it should actually be--light blue with a SLIGHTLY darker shade of aztec-ing.Other than the paint scheme, the model is made of heavy plastic, and is quite nicely detailed. It's a shame they picked the color scheme they did; if the colors were correct this would be beautiful."
3,Standerd Enterprise D,"Ok, first up I will tell you is the con(s) always, lets start.First con, the color is, well reversed or what it needs to be, instead of greyish aztic patterns you get white, and instead of a whitish hull you get dark grey, its not totally die cast (which I already thought so at purchase, total die cast items would be more like $90 and up) the die cast is limited to its secondery hull, and its proportion is off, but the ONLY Enterprise D that I have seen that had right proportion was the PlayMates Enterprise D, whoever, it is not ugly to look at, the detail is good, the balance is good (a all die cast one would have balance issues with the stand) remember, this is NOT a toy, its to look at, nothing speacle here so its rating would be a 3, maybe a 2 due to color."
1,Teakettle problems,"This teakettle arrived promptly and the return was handled appropriately so I have no problem with the vendor. However when we opened the original packaging, it had some problems. There was black stuff around the seams and even after cleaning it several times it smelled of something chemical. Also, the mechanism that worked the spout cover was awkward and didn't work very well. So it was a Farberware issue."
2,Feels cheap... and steam hits my fingers.,"This is a product that I've slowly learned to hate. When I first started using it, I was a bit concerned about the weird sputtering noises and the way the metal creaks. It seems like the metal is just really thin and I keep thinking it's going to burn through or something. That might be crazy, but I like when a product has a solid feel to it. I could live with that, though. You get what you pay for right? What I can't live with is the spout positioning. It's just too short, in relation to where the trigger to raise the cap is. Every time the water comes to a boil and I pull the trigger and tip the pot, the steam goes straight to my fingers and hand. Ever seen that movie Office Space? Think of the scene with the static electricity on the door knob. I need to find a new kettle with a longer spout."
5,Faberware Tea Kettle,Very nice looking teakettle. Works great and the price was right. I can highly recommend this to others. Thank you.
2,diappointed,Handle is hot to touch. You would need towel to hold handle. Whistle got lose during first week of use. I would not recommend this.
3,The story of the kin of the stars continues,"I bought this show because I hate cliffhangers, and this is the continuation of ""Crest of the Stars."" This story was quite as charming as its predecessor; in fact it was little more boring. Three years after Jinto and Laffiel's adventure they still remain friends, but the small blossom of romance between the two has grown rather stagnant. However there are a lot of battles in this chapter, but mainly with the supporting characters. The two heroes resolve issues with the late barren's sister and later in the story fight in a battle of survival for them and their crew. If you liked the original and really want to know the rest of the story, then you will definitely need to buy this one and ""Banner of the Stars II "". In order to make sense of this story please watch ""Crest of the Stars"" first, otherwise you will be completely lost."
4,It's what I expected,I'm not air filter aficionado. I needed air filters for my home and these work. I can't say there is any specific noticeable difference--there shouldn't be. They were what I expected when I ordered them.
3,nudie movie,The nipples look like plastic and the hair down there looks like my backyard the penises look like slim jims and the butts look like squares its sorta a comedy have fun you perv
5,exactly what i wanted...,"well... if your into dance music, if you like at least one of the vengaboys songs, and if you can get your hands on this particular version of the party album by the vengaboys, you will love this cd. sure, they are fabricated, only one of them actually sings, and the ppl behind the music (the actual 2 vengaboys (the DJ's)) are never in the spotlight but its about the music isnt it? the glitz and the glamour are all part of the illusion but hey, this album is really good.we like to party, great for dancing and parties etc. same with boom, boom, boom, boom and we're going to ibiza.the other unreleased tracks on the album are fantastic. lots of solid dance music which is what i like. its hard for anyone who listens to any of the vengaboys songs not to move. it's really great, i recomend it to everyone..."
3,"Taste Good, Packing very poor.",These apple rings tasted pretty good but the packaging was not up to par. This product is packed in plastic containers with a weak plastic seal under the green cover. The six tubs are placed tightly in an open top box and then plastic wrapped. Due to the tight packaging and normal shipping movement all of the containers had their air tight plastic seal broken (no product left the containers).
4,Nice Pot - Like Mom and Dad Used to Use....Except....,"I really purchased this pot as part of my survival inventory to use if we ever lost power. Right off the bat it brought back memories of how my parents used to make coffee back in the 60's when I was a kid.It's a good pot and it does brew a good cup of coffee or tee. Is it as well made as the old ones from way back...well no it's not. Metal is a bit thinner, especially the basket and stem, but by today's standards it pretty well made. My only real issue with it and why it only got four stars is the plastic percolator/viewing cap. For such a nice pot I would think it would have a glass cap. I was a little disappointed.Overall though it's a nice pot and I am happy with the purchase."
1,Stopped Percolating,"I got the Farberware 50124 and it worked fine making coffee at first, but after a few months I needed to heat it longer and longer for it to start percolating. Eventually I gave up because I was heating it over an hour and could hear the water boiling, but it wasn't percolating. I don't understand why it stopped working because I clean it after every use with soap and water, and towel dry it. I use fresh grounds with every use. I think I will have to buy an electric, because my parents use one of those and have had consistent use from it for years."
3,"Love the fresh perked coffee, but be careful.....","I always hated the drip machines and tried my luck with an electric percolator. It stopped working after less than a month of use. Thankfully the store took it back. That is when I decided to just get an old fashioned stovetop percolator, just like Grandma always used. I bought this pot from Amazon after reading many reviews for different pots out there. I must say I love fresh brewed coffee. However there are more ""floaties"" in my cup then I was led to believe from the reviews. I tried to brew with a filter in the basket. Don't do it. It doesn't work! Also, be very careful when washing this pot. I found out the hard way, the spout edges are VERY SHARP. I sliced my thumb pretty badly while I was rinsing it."
2,"Terrible quality, but I made it work for me...","Between the PLASTIC (not glass) cap losing it's grip, almost becoming useless within the first two weeks and the filter basket always letting a bit of grinds into the coffee, this isn't a well made product. However, I've owned it over a year & routinely use it. I found some thin paper filters I use to combat the grinds & I deal with the useless cap. If the cap wern't a reject, I'd have given this four stars. Farberware seems useless as their caps anymore..."
5,love it!,"Nothing tastes better than a good, old fashion cup of coffee from a percolator. Easy to use. Coffee brews quickly and it is a great cup of coffee. I am so over those KCups"
4,Really Nice,"I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars b/c it has a plastic top (i prefer glass) which cracks after several uses and causes the coffee to leak from the top when percolating .... Also they don't make it in smaller sizes, and the base could be a bit more solid/thicker.Pros: Coffee tastes great, I've had it for a year and I'm still using it."
4,CLASSIC,"Just as advertised, an old-fashioned percolator. Built well, and a very attractive design. Everytyhing you want when you don't have electricity."
3,"Plastic Percolator Top, we buy stainless steel to avoid plastic","I just do not trust drinking hot fluids bathed in plastic, that is why I chose a stainless steel coffee pot. So I am going to purchase the extra glass top, I hope it fits."
1,No Truth in Advertising,"This is advertised with having a GLASS top which is a lie. The top knob is made of PLASTIC. Why does this concern me - heated up plastic leeches into the water. AND, this is advertised as holding 8 cups. Well when I measured cups of water - six cups of water hit the 8 cup mark. So in addition to lying about the glass top, they also lie about this being an 8-cup coffee maker. It's only a six cup."
1,Not American made quality!,"The clear plastic percolator window on top has broken with light use. It should have been made of glass like the old quality percolatos like Revere. If you buy this, be prepared to shell out for a glass top, which is available and should be on all new percolators. Made in China but with the mask name of a rugged American mountain/park is just more bucks in the pocket of some CEO."
3,Nice Pot,"Very nice - just one problem - the plastic clear top melts a bit. I had to order a glass one, which was very difficult to find. Suggest Farberware go with glass or include another top with their pots. Otherwise I'd given it a Five star."
4,"Very good overall, except that the surface is very hot.",It meets my expectation and we are using it regularly.The only down side is the hot surface all around it. I burnt my fingers lightly several times. Definetely keep out of the reach of children.
5,Extremely pleased,"This stovetop percolator from Farberware is the best!1. Can use 'high' setting on your stove without the water boiling over, even when the pot is full.2. Interior pieces are top quality stainless steel.3. Handle stays cool.4. Easy cleanup.5. Attractive piece you will enjoy keeping on your stove.I use mine every morning. Love it. Farberware makes top quality merchandise."
2,"Great Pot, however...........","This coffee pot has one major flaw, the handle is spot welded on and actually broke off in shipping. If Farberware made the same pot with a rivoted handle I'd buy it in a heartbeat.Farberware Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator"
3,Not like the old ones',"This product is made well, however, the design (wider and slightly shorter) is different enough compared to the older design that while perking the coffee ""spurts"" out of the pouring nozzle. I liked the older design better."
5,Awsome song cool video on MTV!!!,It is so cool how it start's off first a man about to rob a store then his good conscience talks to the man that's (Dr.Dre). Then the bad conscience talk's to the man that's (Emieim). But the man's smart and listen's to his good conscience I think the man's name was gratie? very cool song!!!
3,No email for invoices,"Have you ever tried to e-mail an invoice to anyone. The application creates a PDF of about 9 or 10 kb, allows you to specify ""to"" and ""from,"" but then doesn't send anything thing. Also, 9 or 10 kb seems much too small for a PDF invoice.Other than that, 2007 is a minor improvement over the previous version (2002)I had. Granted, I don't use very many of the features. I actually liked MYOB on my old Mac better.Also, this application gives you very little ability to modify the appearance of invoices; less than my old MYOB."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA!,"Well, besides the fact that it's a gigantic install (we had to upgrade the RAM on our computers to 1 GB for this one) and grossly inefficient, it's NOT compatible with Windows Vista. Tech support said I needed to buy the Premium version, which is completely overkill. I think it's time to look at Quickbooks for our company."
3,Shouldn't have bought it,I bought this software at Amazon. Then I found out there was a free download copy from this company. Should have known it earlier.
5,very good,"My family and I love this movie. I wish it had English subtitles so we could sing along, but it still was fun."
1,A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM,"I've always like this movy, but the copy sent me was a re-production (disc produced in Mexico was labled on box) and wasn't of the best quality."
4,funny material,"the timing and execution was superb. It was what is a comedy of this nature should be, no morale agenda, just funny!"
4,Cheesy 60s Humor,"If you can get past the horrible 60's humor, this is a hilarious show. Me and my dad watched it, and half the time we were scorning at the corny acting, the other half we were laughing at the hilarious jokes.... It's all in the eye of the beholder. I give it 4 stars for leaving out some of the original Broadway songs."
2,bad but not completely devoid of interest,"This is okay if you're in the mood (drunk late at night) and don't know the real musical, especially Stephen Sondheim's brilliant song score, savaged here. The problem is director Richard Lester. Compare his ""A Hard Day's Night"" to his ""Help!""--or anything else of his--and it is immediately obvious that ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a fluke. (George Martin recounts in ""All You Need is Ears"" how Lester harrassed him on the set of ""A Hard Day's Night"" so much that he refused to score ""Help!"". ""Help!"" suffers for his absence--George Martin won an academy award for ""A Hard Day's Night"".)(Speaking of music, I do recommend, for what it's worth, ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns.)"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:AFTHotWTtF means well, but it's dated and not terribly funny and only worth watching if you really like Ancient Rome--even those who like musicals should be warned, for much of the music from the stage show has been cut."
5,WOW!!!,"When the reverend at my church first recomended this movie to me claiming it had the ""funnest 30 seconds ever filmed"" I just had to see it for myself! Lo and behold, Zero Mostel as the fortune-teller was (and is) the absolute funniest thing I have ever seen. But the laughs don't stop there! The whole movie is great. I reconmend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good slapstick as much as I do."
1,BUYER BEWARE THIS DVD WON'T PLAY IN USA!.,"Bought from Movie-Mars.. who NOW tells me, REGION 2 is UK not USA. yA THINK they might spell that out on the offering?????????????? The burden is on me to repackage and mail it back."
1,A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Watch this movie!,"The DVD sent was in the wrong format for USA DVD players. This info was not in the product information when we ordered it. Movie Mars has now added this detail, most likely due to numerous complaints and returned DVDs. They refunded the cost of the movie, but not the shpping and handling, which was about the same amount as the cost of the movie. Very unhappy with this purchase and will be quite unlikely to order another DVD from this seller. This is a really great movie, but I guess we won't be able to see it until it shows up on TV again."
4,Great read,"True Memories is a chance to read a page turner about a unique time in history, Germany from 1916, when the Kaiser was Emperor, until the present day and the Author's journey to the discovery of her family's heritage."
3,missing pages,"The book is otherwise in great condition but is missing the ""Author's Note"" pages. The table of contents says that there is an ""Author's Note"" but I dont see it in the book. Not sure if its a printing mistake or the pages are actually missing."
2,A bit late& boring,"I remember when Samantha Fox released this Spanish influenced song ""the reason is you"" in summer 1997. It was SO wonderful. But now Geri comes up with a Spanish influenced song 2 years later, I think she's a bit behind the trend. She gets so much money for promotion and every TV station plays this song, I can't understand it. It's a song that is TOO commercial and boring. I remember that Paradisio ""Bailando"" was not a major hit in the UK 2 years ago, even if it was THE summer hit of the year. And now Geri was No. 1 in the Uk with this boring song, it's hard to believe. Well, I think the mass still likes trash."
4,Prints great!,"Prints great. The manual feed tray sticks and is hard to open and close. Other than that, everything works like new."
4,Yardley's English Lavendar,Just by chance I happened to use this liquid soap in a restaurant's rest room and fell in love with it all over again. I had to have it! It smells wonderful! I like the fact that it is antibacterial as well as moisturizing (although my hands feel kind of dry after using this soap). But I use it anyway because I just love the scent. Great job Yardley!The items arrived quickly and in perfect condition. No problems there. I definitely will be ordering more.
2,remove the triclosan!,"I love this soap and used it for years until I read about the antibacterial chemical, triclosan, which is one of the ingredients. This is an unnecessary addition to the soap and helps contribute to the antibiotic-resistant infections rife in this country. I keep waiting for Yardley to reformulate its soap, but until they do I'm no longer buying it, and you shouldn't either."
2,Liquid soap,I really liked this product. It has a really nice smell and leaves your hands soft after washing.The reason I gave two stars is for the chemical Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.I have removed all products with this chemical from my house.
3,My dog loves this toy...but the squeaker came broken.,We've had about 5 of these geese in our house because my dog loves them. This one Santa brought...but it came with a broken squeaker. : (
4,De-honkified within the first week,"Well made and a great price. The squeeze honker inside sounded great for the first week. After that it went silent, which may please some of you. I know that my dog loves to hear a reaction when he bites down. After about a month the toy still has 100% of its stuffing, which is a pretty good track record."
5,This is TOO Real!,"Wow... fiction, or prophesies revealed? You won't sleep well at night after you read this.... and for sure won't sleep until you've finished the book. This is ""fiction""? at it's best. A worthy read."
2,These USED to be the best out there! Now they're just OKAY.,"WHY, OH WHY would Gluten Free Pantry mess with a great thing? The reviews of this product are ALL from pre-recipe change. I wonder what everyone thinks now that the recipe has changed. The FIRST ingredient in these brownies used to be DUTCH COCOA and OH, were they decadent! But NOW, they don't stand out above any other mix out there. They are just ""okay"", where they used to be FAR superior, heads and shoulders above the competition! I'm extremely disappointed. They taste so BLAH now. I won't be buying them anymore."
5,The Best,"Absolutely delicious! Compare them with any other mix, gluten-free or not, and these are the very best, hands down."
5,Great brownies that just happen to be gluten free,"These are great brownies that just happen to be gluten free! Everyone loves them, including wheat eaters!I have Celiacs disease and cannot eat gluten or I get very ill. I have NEVER gotten ill from these brownies! This means they are 100% gluten free and safe for those on gluten free diets.NOTE: Be careful to not overcook them! It can happen quickly if you are not being observant and dry or burnt brownies are not very palatable = PBEST STORAGE: Do not leave them out on the counter, in a cookie jar, or in the fridge. Gluten free foods dry out quickly. Instead you should cut them into squares while still a little warm and freeze them. Then you can defrost fresh nummy brownies whenever you would like to eat them!I consider these the best brownies i have ever eaten and the only brownies I will ever buy."
3,An amazing voice in search of a better song...,"Johnny Logan is a truly marvelous singer, with an intense, passionate style that really soars with the right material. Here, he's covering the old Paul McCartney song in a high-NRG dance version that is very European-sounding. That makes sense; the song is intendend for the German market. But Johnny is capable of so much more vocally, particularly on some of his past hits like ""Hold Me Now"" and ""What's Another Year."" Still, it's worth checking out, just to his hear his dynamic vocal style. This is from his album ""Love Is All,"" which is out in Germany and is also worth a listen if you're a fan of great male pop singers."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Do NOT waste your money on this CD! Most of the content was soft mediation simply telling you to visualize yourself as 'confident' in an interview... over and over and over. The rest of the 'inside tips' were so basic, it was no more than common sense (ie. don't be late for the interview)."
4,simple computational modelling,"A useful though somewhat dated monograph for the biologist or ecologist interested in grasslands. Spedding emphasises that grasslands are vital in global food production, and that the analysis presented here is not purely academic.He surveys grasslands throughout the world, including the African savannah and domesticated regions. Basic energy cycle balancing is used to show the significant energy flows. Plus, various models of grasslands are described. By today's standards, these are computationally quite simple to implement."
5,very good 4play,I have to agree this is the best fourplay album ever!! if you don't have it go get it. you won't be disappointed!!
5,Lambo lover,Great info of the Countach as well as pics to support the text. A must have for Countach lovers and owners!
3,"Ok Book, Could have been better, But so far the only book on the Subject.","Agree with most others book is basically reviews by the author in magazines, There are some pics of the Jalpa,Lm/cheetah, and some pics of the Countach(""Coon-Tash"") its a interesting read, When I was a Kid I liked these cars, I still do sort of. they are better looking then whats coming out from VW's Lambo"". Which are small and nancy looking Except maybe for A ALL BLACK Murciealgo. The cars are pretty much bling and any bozo can drive one now. So its cool reading the development on this Car,While not a Everyday car Like A Corvette, Its a Interesting Read Even with the Understandable Author's Bias(Lambos are imho indeed better than Ferrari). Pick it up and read for yourself."
4,Caught in the Act,"A well developed story line, believable characters, finshed well. A good book for a wet weekend read - I didn't want to put it down even after the last page."
4,caught in the act,It is a truly wonderful read that makes you want to keep reading this suspenseful novel to the very end!
1,Nice product but caller ID doesn't work,"Purchased one and couldn't get the Caller ID feature to work. Called Hughes support at 1-800-454-2013 and was told that it was a know problem but they had a corporate policy directing them to not issue RMA's for this problem.Otherwise, the RF remote is real nice and the receiver does work better than my older model."
4,Highly entertaining comedy-drama,"I love stuff like this, quirky Altman-esque comedy-dramas with huge casts, and this did not disappoint. For a film that was almost entirely improvised, ""Parallel Lives"" chugs along quite smoothly. Standouts in the cast are Liza Minnelli (who deserved an Emmy nomination), Lindsay Crouse, Dudley Moore and Ally Sheedy."
5,What fun!,"This book is great for sequencing and ""what comes next"" dialogue between the reader and listener. It lets the reader and listener participate vicariously in an exciting adventure. Lots of fun for everyone."
5,LOVE IT,I just got this bag. I love it. It is HUGE. I will be able to use it for so many things. Great Tote Bag!
5,Classic Looking,"When I asked my dad what he wanted for his birthday, he said he wanted a watch that had clean lines and was ""classic"" looking. After browsing in many stores and online, I kept coming back to this Bulova. It is sleek, yet substantial. It is a good size, not overly large as some men's watches can be. My dad's reaction to the watch was great. He loved it and said it was the best gift he's ever received. He has since mentioned that he wears it nearly daily and that it goes well with his business attire and casual wear. Overall, I think this Bulova was a great choice and with the company's reputation, I know my dad will have this watch for a very long time."
1,WHAT IS IT...,IT IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE EVER DONT BUY IT DONT RENT IT DONT LOOK AT IT IT SUCKS WORSE THAN ANYTHING HAS EVER SUCKED EVER NOTHING IS GOOD ABOUT IT IT IS ALL BADNESS!!!!!!I CANT SAY IT ENOUGH STAY AWAY FROM IT SAVE SOME MORE MONEY AND BUY CHAMPIONS OF NORRATH IT IS WAY BETTER
1,Terrible Battery,Will not hold a charge and will not charge half the time. Spend the extra cash and get a REAL battery.
4,Pretty cool stuff...,"I just got my GXCEBOT today and am pretty impressed with it so far. Unit was well packaged, and came with every cable I could conceivably have used (even one to connect the VCR). I did have a weird problem during setup where the screen would go blank, and I'd get a 'Access Card has Expired' message, then the picture would come back for a minute, then go blank again, etc. A quick call to DirecTV (well, quick if you don't count the time on hold) fixed that problem - they just sent some kind of re-init command to the box.Picture is great, and I have no problems with noisy hard drives or fans. Love the TiVo features. The only disappointing thing was not being able to watch my local cable channels thru the TiVo interface - I know I've seen receivers that can do this, so maybe they'll offer a software upgrade soon.So overall a big thumbs up for this machine!"
1,Bad Waranty Service,"I purchased a Hughes TIVO in November of 2001. I set it up using the two receivers. On April 4, 2002, it stopped working. It could not find the satelite signal on either receiver. I hooked up a diferent satelite receiver to both lines and each worked fine. The service had been great. I called the 800 number in the guide which came with the unit. It referred me to a toll number which I had to call for technical assistance. They don't open until 8:00 a.m. I got in touch with a tech named Tax who told me that they were having that problem with some units. I was instructed to send the unit back and it would be replaced in about two weeks. I called today (4/15/02) and was informed by Alex that it would now be another 6 to 8 weeks for replacement because the units are on back order. The unit was great when it worked, but the service is quite frustrating. One would think that Hughes would pull some off the market to replace such a unit."
3,Never Enough,"This is the second book on this topic I have ordered. I have been in search of a ""beginning"" book that will bridge the gap between the scripts and the implementation thereof. Steps A - B have been more like steps D, J - L, then Q. Fragmented at best. Hopefully, someday, someone will produce a book for someone like me, who admittedly needs to be hand held and walked through this topic."
1,More of the same,"Yet another in a long line of ubiquitous Dolly Parton collections that draw far too heavily from her pop sellout and mostly ignores her more vital country work. Just who is it at RCA and BMG that is responsible for these lackluster, uninspired compilations? Most of these songs are readily available elsewhere, and while this one does collect a few of her fine country songs, their mingling with slick, safe, overproduced pop songs just serve to further frustrate those of us who long for a much more compelling collection, or better yet, reissues of Parton's full country catalog."
1,Losers....,"I get a kick out of fools who come on here and write reviews for games that are not even out yet. Probably signed on with the software company to come into chats and message boards to create hype in exchange for t-shirts and other worthless loot. If you havne't played the game shut your mouth. No one but idiots like that are going to buy a game based on how good someone thinks it's gonna be. ""man...what great screen shots"" ""Wow, I can't wait to get my hands on this..it looks awesome!"" Pfffft......get a friggin life...."
5,Love This Pan!!!!!!!!,I only bake once or twice a year and using this bundt pan made such a beautiful presentation that nobody believed I'm a casual baker.I had no problems removing the cake from the pan; I sprayed the pan with Pillsbury Baking spray with flour and walaa! It slid out and onthe cooling rack. Now that I have THIS pan I'll probably bake more!
1,horrible....,"I dont understand why everyone is giving this album such good reviews... first off they have never been extremley talented musicians but on their ep the songs were so catchy you couldnt help but love it. In this cd I didn't feel that they had the same catchiness and it is to overproduced.Also almost all of these songs were already released on their demos and on the internet before their ep. Most of them sound exactly the same as the originals just a bit more produced. How lazy is this band???? Also as I said they aren't that talented. They make catchy music which grabs people attention but look at the actual musicianship....it sucks. This cd should only draw in fans that are about 10 years old. So if you like over produced, untalented, catchy, music buy this album. If not pick up anything else (any band is better)"
3,Snack Sized Popocorn,"I like this popcorn in that it really is snack sized and comes in low fat Kettle Korn. I agree with one of the reviewers who said to watch how long you leave it in the microwave. I have burned a few bags because I left it in the microwave for more than 1:20 seconds. If you left it in there as the instructions recommend you would always have burnt popcorn. Also, many kernels do not pop. I gave this product 3 stars because it does taste pretty good and is a good snack if you are trying to watch your weight. I like that it is already portioned so you can eat the whole bag and not feel like you went off your diet."
2,Not nonstick,"Like many of the other reviewers, I would have thought that an egg-poaching pan that claims to be nonstick would have cups that are nonstick. Wrong. Everything BUT the cups is nonstick, but the cups are plastic. A ring of egg is left on them even after I've used cooking spray. Beyond that, the cups are hard (and somewhat dangerous) to remove once the eggs are done. Their handles are hot, and they're too small to grip well with a pot holder. Once I have them out of the pan, I've had a hard time turning them over to slide the eggs out onto a plate. They've slipped out of my hand on more than one occasion."
2,waste of money,"You get what you pay for here. Plastic cups do a poor job of transferring heat to the eggs, and you're like to wind up with either barely poached or totally overdone eggs. Spend more money for any of the poachers with non-stick aluminum cups now rather than wasting $20 on this and having to buy the better quality poacher later anyway."
1,Horrible to clean!,"The individual egg cups are plastic. Using fats (Pam, butter, oil) was not effective to completely keep the egg from sticking to the cups. Horrible trying to clean the egg cups.Save your money and time. Buy another brand with non-stick egg cups."
2,Plastic doesn't work,"I've been using my egg poacher for several weeks and have one big complaint: the egg cups are made of plastic which is non-conductive of heat. The egg cooks from the top down using the steam in the pan. When it seems done I find that the top is done but the bottom is runny and water has collected on top. I damaged one of the cups one day - it got too close to a burner and melted - and substituted a metal one from an old poacher. I was amazed how fast, and how much better,the egg poached in that cup."
1,Terrible egg poacher,"Do not buy this egg poacher. The nonstick cups actually act as insulators, so it takes nearly 10 minutes to poach eggs to the proper doneness. In addition, the lid does not have any holes to allow moisture to escape, so the cups fill with water as the eggs are poaching. I gave away a 25-year-old aluminum, really cheap, egg poacher and replaced it with this one. Big mistake. The old one worked far better than this one."
1,Non-stick is Not True,"I've been looking for a replacement poacher for my old aluminum poacher (vintage 50's) and have tried a few so far. The Farberware poacher is not for me! The plastic cups are far from nonstick. I followed manufacturers instructions concerning washing and coating with oil but to no avail. Farberware also says to use a knife to loosen the egg--if nonstick, this would not be necessary. Bottom line, the eggs stick horribly. If you don't mind digging your eggs out, this may be the one for you."
1,I would give this less than a one if I could,I have an older Faberware 6 cup poacher that I love. Bought this four cup one for when we have company and it is truly awful. The cups give the thing an odd taste and being plastic they cook poorly. Avoid this and look for one with metal cups - for me this was a waste of $20
2,Mediocre,"This film is factually shaky (it says that Gilliam worked for Mad Magazine) and says nothing but in hollywood industry praise talk (""great director,"" ""visionary director,"" yadda yadda). A few of the interviews are slightly interesting, but if you're at all familiar with Gilliam, this is entirely unnecessary."
4,protects the face,"I took a chance and purchased this for GPSMAP 78...the newer model. It does not exactly fit, but with a piece of velcro extension on the closure it still covers the screen perfectly. (and I didn't find one made for the 78 elsewhere) It covers the face and there is no problem pressing the buttons through the plastic, it does not cover the entire piece of equipment...but the equipment is supposed to be waterproof, etc anyway."
3,Fits great butt...,I am very impressed with how well the case fits the GPS however the plastic makes operating the GPS difficult.
2,Bought it per an Amazon suggestion with my GPSMAP 60CSx,I really haven't used this item since purchasing my GPS... it was tried once & is a bit clumsy to access the keys of the Garmin. It might be OK... just not for my use.
4,Good Protection,"Nice accessorie for my 60csx....wish it was a little tighter to have better control of buttons. Also,it's a drag to take cover off for usb connection.But it's worth protecting this great GPS."
2,2 1/2 stars...it wasn't magic for me.,"I have to agree with the last several reviewers. This could have been a very good book. There was a grood premise, great good guys who were sexy, creepy bad guys, a decent setting...but it just lacked something undefinable. You end up thinking, ""Why did I waste my time with this?"" It was fresh at the beginning and just stalled some where in the middle & became lost in itself. By the ending you just don't really care about the characters anymore.This book has set itself up to start a series but it lacks the spark to carry it through. Maybe if they go back to the drawing board & edit the next one critically I'll pick it up. Otherwise I wouldn't waste the money on it."
1,Couldn't finish the book.,I purchased this book on the positive reviews from the author and others.....I usually love the paranormal romance....but was not ready for the overly sexual nicknames of human body parts in the non-romantic scenes. I didnt even make it to the middle of the book. I would never recommend this book to anyone.
3,Couldn't immerse myself in the story,"This is the first book I have read by this author but it is definitely not the first in this genre. Being an avid book reader, I'm willing to try my hand at any new book. While I found the story to be a good one and well-constructed, I was never able to immerse myself in the book. The characters never jumped off the page for me. Perhaps as the series develops I will be able to obtain the escape I am looking for when I read."
3,Dark World,"I wasn't expecting this world that Cheyenne has created to be as 'dark' as it is. It is like our own world but it seems to be only focusing on all the terrible things that happen. I felt a little overwhelmed by all the different worlds (underworld, otherworld, Earth), if seemed like I was missing vital information and just reading to catch up.However I liked the hero Hawke, a Tuatha D' Danann warrior that is summoned by the Grey witch Silver. Hawke is a strong man with morals, he will do what he knows is right, duty before pleasure. Silver seemed to me to be confused, confused about herself, about telling people about her grey magic, confused about the terrible things happening and also about her sister. I sensed the resolution of her and Hawkes love and also her grey magic. But her sisters disapearance was very up in the air, which i assume would lead to the next book."
1,Kindle version horrible,"I am not writing this review in regards to content (because I did not finish it) but about the kindle version. I couldn't actually finish the book because the kindle version was too difficult to read. I have read over 300 books on my kindle, but this looked like someone had photocopied the book and scanned it into a digital version. On the same page some sentences were in bold and some not. It was really to hard to focus on the words. I can't believe I paid money for it!"
5,WOW!!!!,"I just picked this book up and it was great. I didn't want to put it down. The story was fast paced, action packed, and very steamy. I am going to be looking for more of her books."
1,Poor Reliability and Warranty,"I have a ...Sony DVD player. Sony claims a 1 year part/90 day labor warranty. First, the machine simply stopped working after 5 months. Second, to send it in for warranty repair, Sony wants (Money)for labor, upfront, plus I have to pay for the cost to ship the item. They don't assess the problem and then give you an estimate, permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through with a repair. Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony. Check out what the warranty, when you purchase. Select a product with 1 year parts and labor. Otherwise, find out what the manufacturer charges for warranty service.Watch out for deceptive warranty policies."
3,only one or two complaints,"1. You will always have to tell it to do something twice. For instance, walking up to the player and pressing open will not open it for you, you will have to press the open button once more. The first you press any button- only readies it for your command (on the remote too). A little irritating, but livable.2. Playing DVD's is like a dream, but cd's are a different story. I've had many cd's that are flawless on the surface (not cd-recordable, but manufactured) that the player will get tripped up on. All the sudden, your music stops. The player is trying, but can't play the track (this doesn't happen all that much- but nonetheless very irritating).As far as the ""progressive scan"" thing is concerned, it's peace of mind. I have an HD rear-projection TV that I used with a standard sony player (the jukebox- not progressive scan), and honestly, I notice ZERO difference between a progressive scan player and one without it."
5,Rayman is the coolest!,Rayman is as cute as he is funny.(those of you who don't think he's cute must be stone-hearted!)I like the fact that Rayman seems to (sometimes) act like less than half his age!It's a funny sight watching him mess around.
1,"Not what was advertised, at all","I purchased this book after reading the review AND calling to be sure that it was the Big Book version. Was assured it was the Big Book version, made the purchased and received the regular sized book. Not a happy camper at all."
2,Item was not as advertised,This little book has limited information that could be downloaded from the internet. The seller made me believe that I was getting the pocket size of DSM-IV that contains all the axis. Not happy!
5,Just wish is was larger,It is a great little book. I supervise counseling interns and it's a great way to give them ideas of questions to ask to find more information about a client. If it was bigger it would be easier for me to make notes and suggestions in it for them.
1,fly fishing video,a real disappointment. video was less than basic and not very informative. i was expecting much more from scientific anglers.
4,"great, but slides around!","I bought this grill as the Nordic-ware one that I bought somewere else was only good for one time, then it didnt clean good,seemed to rust and it also costs alot more then this one...This Double Grill works great every time..The only problem that I find is, That it slides around on the top of the stove while I'm turning over my pancakes..I have a gas stove, with the Heavy grates, don't understand why this happens, I think its too smooth on the bottom?...It cleans up very easy, and my pancakes cook evenly.The only reason that I gave it a 4 stars , is because it slides around on the stove while cooking...The handles get hot so you have to use a pot holder (or dish towel) and I think its going to get into the flame, so be careful...Enjoy though..."
4,SPEAKER SELECTOR,"THE BUTTONS ARE A LITTLE ""CHEESSY"" BUT THE UNIT WORKED PERFECTLY.WE USE THE SPEAKER SELECTOR TO LISTEN TO THE TV WHILE JOGGING ON THE TREADMILL (THE TREADMILL IS IN THE NEXT ROOM FACING THE TV THRU A DOORWAY SO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR) WE ADDED AN ADDITION CENTER CHANNEL NEXT TO THE TREADMILL AND WITH THE SPEAKER SELECTOR WE CAN LISTEN TO EITHER THE CENTER CHANNEL ABOVE THE TV AND / OR NEXT TO THE TREADMILL.SEAMS TO BE AN EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY."
3,Speaker Selector,"I returned this item as once it arrived I determined it would not work with my stereo system. It was my error in not looking at my system prior to ordering. However, I do believe it would have been just what I was looking for and was fairly pleased with the quality."
1,Sound Crossover,"I purchased this item 12/12/2009 and just used outputs 1 & 2. Today, 11/14/2010, I hooked up a output 3. It has a crossover to output 1 so the sound I put to my garage also goes to 1 speaker on my patio. I don't want that, especially at night. Also, the buttons have a pale orange reflector instead of lights when active. They are hard to see without getting real close."
4,Easy to use and it works!,"I was looking for a low cost option to link speakers located in an outdoor sitting area to the main home theatre/music system. This is ideal, the product is simple to use, does not require any any power and does the job. The sound quality is good."
4,Works as intended,"Cheapest 4 zone switch I could find. Works as intended. I was just looking for a simple switch, nothing fancy. The stickers are great as well, for my wife especially. :D"
1,Lower quality substitute,"After trying on the Go-Go Latin dance shoe of a friend, I was expecting a soft leather, an easy catch, and a cushioned interior. The Awards brand shoe I received looked the same, but was not soft, had extraneous glue, and lacked the easy dance catch. Dance4less claims that this shoe is a better quality. It is inferior. When I tried to exchange it I got no response to several e-mails. When I called I was told my package was probably lost in the mail."
4,Just the right height,"I have a short, rather wide (thru the ball of the foot, not the heel) foot with a high arch and high instep and the first pair of dance shoes I bought were just a touch too high which caused me some discomfort in the ankles, knees and hip. I don't generally wear heels higher than 1 1/2-2 inches so even though those shoes were supposed to have 2 1/2 inch heels, they apparently were measured at the inside (front) of the heel rather than at the back. These shoes are actually 2 1/2 inches high measured at the back and that has made a huge difference in my comfort while dancing in them. My only problem with these shoes is the hook that slides over the decorative buckle on the strap is not always easy for me to unhook and it may take me quite a long time to finally get the shoe off!"
4,This is a great song!,"I actually do not own the CD Single, but I have the song ""Cave"" on the Little Nicky Soundtrack. Muse is an interesting group, and their song ""Cave"" is really awesome. It has a very haunting vibe to it, and the singer has a lot of emotion in his voice. If there is one bad thing about this song, it is that the singer's voice may seem annoying to some people, but once you get used to it it's a great song. I would reccomend buying whatever Muse CD this is on, because I am not really sure. :) Hearing this song might drive me to buy some more things from Muse!!"
2,Not for me,"The pictures make this watch look very cool and futuristic that is why I ordered it. Unfortunately the screen is just too dim, almost like it is broken like other reviewers have warned about. I had to return it, it is not a functional watch."
1,"Not So Excellent -- Jargon and Survey, but what insight?","If you want to read one book on a Christian response to the post-modern cultural phenomenon, I don't think this is the one. They survey a number of theorists on post-modernity, but they do little to convert jargon into English. They offer a modest contribution by suggesting the obligation to acknowledge a ""call"" to be stewards of creation in response to God's ""gift"" of creation, but I'd suggest you read Walter Truett Anderson's ""Reality Isn't What It Used To Be"" for a first-hand account by a thoroughly post-modernist and then pick up Dietrich Bonhoffer's ""Cost of Discipleship"" for the Christian response part of the equation."
4,Power Metal!,Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1 is an excellent power metal record. Excellent vocals and out of this world guitar riffs really make this a must have. If you haven't listened to Helloween before this is a great place to start.
4,comfy,"My 75-lb shepherd/husky mix seems to find this very comfortable for awhile, but when she needs to stretch her legs, she finds a little confining. Perhaps she would prefer the style with the bolster on only one side.She looks very cute, though, using the ""bagel"" as a pillow. You need a large space for this bed - the sides make it look more intrusive. Also, at least at first, it is a little unstable and tips a little, so you need it next to a wall. I have some concern about how I will launder it."
3,Good movie,"This was a pretty good movie. Several turns that I wasn't expecting. It held my attention well. This movie is well worth the price, great acting. Tom Berenger plays a great part, and Debra Winger is real easy on the eyes."
4,Page-turning tormented mystery,"To anyone who has seen the movies, you would be familiar with the basics of the plot, but many things will be different. The book's greatest skill is its restrained subtlety, its staid tone of calm reserve (which seems to me very Japanese in nature,)contrasting with the rising tension and body count. On the other hand, much of what lent the movie the scare-factor was the visual shocks of seeing the twisted faces, the fly exit the screen, etc - and obviously those elements would read differently in this medium.All in all a scary-fun book to pass the time with, and a small bit of insight into Japanese life."
4,"Don't trust the reader from Tokyo, JP","I wanted to read the original novel ever since watching the Japanese version of the movie as I was told it was much better. This version is to help those who cannot read Japanese to enjoy the original version (not that I cannot read Japanese! I CAN!). I read through the first few pages and the authors have put in real effort! Having tried to translate Japanese novels into English, I know it was not easy, especially with the words that do not exist or have an exact word in English. If you are interested to know the original story, by all means, try this book. My 4 stars is not to over-rate this as I have not finished the whole book.A word to Reader from JP, Tokyo - why don't you try to translate the continuation? Your English looks fantastic enough! I am sure your version will be seriously comprehensible!"
4,One of the best Orbital CD's ever!,The Middle of Nowhere is by far one of the greatest CD's I own. I have found that even those who aren't avid fans of electronic music are drawn to this amazing CD. I recommend it to everyone!
3,very disappointing,"Let me start out by stating that I own every orbital album from Green to MoN. I think that this is their worst. However considering that Orbital is my favorite electronic group that is not saying that this CD is bad.. its just that CDs such as In Sides, the Brown album and Snivilization SHINE like the sun in comparison. I would suggest buying those cds in that order and then buying this one... just so you do not get a distorted view of the genius that is Orbital. Responding to what one reviewer said.. I would have to disagree and say that it seems like the Hartnoll brothers rushed this album- it sounds incomplete and void of the intense emotions present in their previous works. 2 words- buy In Sides."
3,Not quite there....,"This album is a bit strange; sometimes i'm in awe of it and other times i can't wait to hit the stop button. Trax like Spare Parts Express were awesome at first, but now i'm a bit bored of it. Nothing Left is overlong, and grates on my nerves after a while. Then there's Style, which makes me wonder why i ever liked Orbital in the first place. The blasted thing whines on and on (are those BAGPIPES? they sound a bit like it.), then that stupid Dollar sample hits in and it proceeds to go ON AND ON for another few minutes. Then i sigh with relief and realise In Sides is lying on my shelf. I Really liked this at first, but after many plays it just sounds rubbish, and way too clever for it's own good. It's a shame, because i think Orbital really have potential, and lets face it, they were there first as far as 'electronica' is concerned. But there are better things to spend your money on at the moment. Like the other Orbital albums."
5,yep,"been listening to sharam and ali for a while, as for the people who prefer sasha and digweed and kleinenberg to deep dish. they're all fantastic! just wait, next gu is not in miami, with none planned for it as far as i know, you might be reffering to moscow 22, which was also damn good! gu 23 is james lavelle in barcelona, 24 is nick warren in rekyavick (probably spelt that wrong eh?) well it's in iceland. as for the cd obviously a classic and a must have, but aren't they all!"
2,Disappointed,"THERE WAS NOIT ENOUGH DETAILS, TOO MUCH ABOUT THE LIVES OF THE VICTIMS LESS MURDER DETAILS. I WANT MORE GRAPHIC INTENSITY AND PICTURES TOO.."
2,agreed: not non-stick,"I agree with the previous reviewers. This griddle was not non-stick for very long in my hands, and was difficult to clean once something got burned onto it. I'm shopping for a new one after having this one maybe two years."
1,HORRIBLE!,I bought this because it was cheap. And man it gave it back to me. I tried it at first with non-stick cooking spray. The spray stayed on the pan and does not come off. Then the non-stick coating bubbled up and is coming off in my food. It also warped really bad because it is aluminum on the inside. DO NOT BUY! Invest in a cast iron griddle instead so you will not have these issues!
2,Not worth it.,"1) As others here have said, it's barely non-stick.2) It has a lip on the edge that prevents either side from making direct contact on a flat surface. I have a glass top range so I feel like it would heat faster and more evenly if it could actually make contact with the burner surface.3) Cleaning: the grooves on the grill side are deep, wide (with thin bars that contact the food), and straight up and down. This makes it extremely difficult to clean."
1,Terrible griddle,"The aluminum is so thin it gets scorching hot spots right over the burner while the rest of the griddle remains at a considerably lower temp, making it possible to fry eggs that are burned on one edge and runny on the other. Pass this one by and get a nice heavy cast iron griddle."
1,"Sticky, sticky, sticky!","The non-stick on this item is the stickiest I've ever experienced. I have other cookware w/ non-stick that works beautifully, but this one is just the opposite. Everything I have cooked on this grill has stuck: pancakes, bacon, steak, chicken & pork. I have tried using oil and cooking spray, but nothing keeps the food from sticking. I got it for Christmas and will return it immediately. It's also impossible to clean. Although the instructions say to just use soap w/ a soft sponge, you have to scrub for a very long time to get it clean. Not a good product."
3,lots of smoke!,"The flat side of this griddle works great, but unless you have a super duty fan exhausting the smoke from the ridged side, I would not recommend using it. You may end up having the fire dept. arrive!"
2,"It does the job, but don't overheat it","I bought this product to use as an indoor grill on my gas square stovetop. The grill fits perfectly over two burners and accomodates a lot of food. I called the company because it was so difficult to clean. They told me first, not to overhead the pan and use it on medium heat and second to clean with a soft scrubber sponge or top rack dishwasher. They also sent me a new pan because the first one I ended up destroying the non-stick coating. With this new one I have been coating the pan with a thin layer of oil before cooking and only heating to medium and it is ok. With chicken you really have to oil the pan and don't turn the chicken over too quickly or else it will stick and then it is very hard to clean. It makes great grill marks and the food does come out as if it was on an outdoor grill. I just don't like the cleaning end of it and if you don't like that either then this product is not for you."
1,Food magnet,"This looks like everything you want it to be. Quality surfaces on both sides. Great weight, heavy and sturdy. I was very excited when I picked this up at the store; the griddle and grill were two missing elements from my kitchen. I thought this was going to be the perfect fit.If by ""non-stick"" Nordic Ware means ""super-stick"", then they are dead on. Too many times have I forgotten to spray on the necessary copious amounts of Pam anti-stick to watch the first half of breakfast (eggs, pancakes, etc) glued down to a pot holder melting 600 degree surface frantically scraping off the food ashes in attempt to save the last half. Just tonight, I was amazed that fatty, juicy burgers stuck to the grill surface after two coats of the anti-stick spray.If you want to get a gift that looks nice and you know will never be used, get this. If you want to cook food without a fight, buy a better rated product."
1,Garbage!,Terrible product. Everything sticks to it. Doesn't matter how low or high the heat is. There is nothing non-stick about it.
1,Not a good buy,"I was really excited when I bought this product. It seemed like such a neat way to cook meats on one side, and pancakes and eggs on the other. This particular brand was not a good choice. After 3 months, it warped and the ends curled up. It was not non-stick and even with cooking spray, food would stick and burn. Trying to clean the burn residue, the coating started to come off as well. I'm going to try a real cast iron, not aluminum coated."
2,disappointing,"The Title""Uncensored"" gives an impression that it has a content that you would no be able to see on TV. I would say 99% you could see on regular TV. There's some cursing(not much)and a flash of nudity. You can see more on HBO.. The advantage is no commercials."
5,Excellent price,"After searching the internet tirelessly, this was the best price I could find for bioballs. Thank you GlobalPets! They were shipped quickly and do exactly what they are supposed to do. This is an excellent price, I needed twice as many as I thought though... to figure out how many you need to fill a compartment, just calculate the square inches of the comartment, and that should be about right."
5,Excellent Book!,"Yes, this book is almost 550 pages (plus a long appendix reviewing topology, linear algebra, and analysis), but I find the pacing simply perfect. The extensive lists of examples are helpful and the exercises are challenging but doable. Yes, the printing quality could be better, but it does not affect the text, and the price can't be beat for such a readable and useful book. It is simply the best choice out there for self-study of manifold theory."
1,"The title and cover image just scream ""retarded""...","I wonder how much the Associated Milk Producers or some similar group paid this lady to slap together this pile of poo? You know you're in for trouble when the same author wrote a book called ""The Peanut Butter Diet"".I am currently trying to get my ""Snickers Diet"" book published. It calls for two ounces of a Snickers bar each day, combined with regular aerobic exercise, high fiber, low fat, fresh fruits and veggies. I tell you it's going to sweep the nation! Are you listening, M&M;/Mars and Prevention Magazine? Let's all sit down and make a deal!"
1,Metal of arms: Glitch in the game,Everything about this game sucks @$$!!!!! First off the controls are sloppy and the graphics are total crap. The plot is as deep as DONKEY KONG. It takes a million shots to damage one guy. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
2,Should have taken a closer look before I purchased it!,"Essentially the same material as his first book. The New York Times review of that book pretty much covers this one.I can't say I'm any more enlightened after reading mostly comments about what the author did, which was great, 20 years ago. However, I was looking for more insight into the reasons business men, intelligent business men for the most part, insist on going for 'buzz' concepts of management that repeatedly are shown to be without merit. Didn't find it in this book. I was left wondering if Mr. Geneen's 'buzz' isn't just another variation that, somehow, I feel I've read before."
1,review f cucina amore,"I think that Nick Stellino has a wonderful personality. It is entertaining to watch his show on TV.The recipes look and sound so good. However, when you actually try to make them from this book, the results are disappointing. I just threw out 1 pound of expensive shrimp. The pasta withshrimp was bland. The shrimp turned out rubbery as cooked according to his directions. Another dish, broccoli rabe and sausage turned out tasting like hospital food. His pot roast was too salty and watery, although the meat was tender. His pasta sauce was not quite right. If you can't get pasta sauce right then how are you going to have success with a book of italian recipes.Don't waste your tie making recipes that don't work. My book will just sit on the shelf for now. I really do like the guy and I hate to have to trash this book."
5,Mushrooms and other Fungi of North America,Roger Phillips et.al. presents a rather comprehensive review of the North American Fungi available to the interested mycophyles who forage the woodlands and grasslands of North America. The photographic plates are exceptionally well done affording an appreciation of the variation that is often found in a given species in relation to micro habitat variations. This book will be a valuable field guide and reference to the serious scientist/naturalist as well as resource to the casual hobbyist or beginner naturalist. Kudos for a well executed compilation and presentation of the topic.
3,CD,"I don't feel this is a ""true worship"" CD. The only songs that gets me to the worshipping place is Number 9 and Number 12 both are sung by Paul Morton ""Bow Down and Worship Him"" and then the reprise of the same song, otherwise, I would send back for a refund"
3,Nice Pictures,"I was hoping that the book would contain more of the words my daughter was learning in ballet class. She likes the book, but it is definitely not a favorite. However, the pictures are well done."
4,It's all about the words....,There are any number of books that reprint the scriptures of the Old and New Testament concerning the Second Coming of the Christ so why should you buy this one??? For no other reason than the calligraphy. Awesome.
4,"Educational, Inspirational","I learned a lot from this book, which covered mental, physical and spiritual fitness. Also inpired me to follow through on the advice. I wish it were longer.A wonderful book..."
5,Best Song Ever!,"Hey! This song is the Best EVER! When I saw Ten Things I Hate About You, (the Movie) I fell in love with the song. It's the best. It is by Letters to Cleo. I have not bought the CD yet, but I am going to today. Anyway, I would like to thank all who have taken the time to read my input on the song. Well thanks allot. ByeLove, Toni"
3,Good Text,"If you want a hard copy this is excellent. The updated English is nice even though the introductions are skewed as noted in other reviews. However, the Lake versions of the Loeb volumes are available on google books if you just want the introductory material. To have something in your hands though this does the trick. The Holmes edition is nice as well."
4,Swinburne University of Technology,"execellent book which all students in swinburne recommended to use it. good example, especially in si metric. easy to understand it."
1,Weak material!!,Just pulling these on for the first time I received a runner in one leg. I didn't even get them up all the way!! Unacceptable!
5,No Cheap Shots at a Genius,"Most authors writing about Hyman Rickover take pleasure in knocking him down. This is one of the few books to describe his achievements and the good he accomplished without an ulterior motive of tearing down a legend.Sure, Admiral Rickover was a man, and former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman probably summed him up best by saying that he ""did a lot of good, and some bad."" Regardless, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program today remains the gold standard of how to operate a complex technical program while protecting the operators and the public good, and study after study confirms that. That the program operates so smoothly today is traceable to Rickover's ideals and the strength of his character when he established the program more than 50 years ago.This book explains how Rickover built the program, by a man who was there. It is a great history of the program."
2,Wanted a different DVD,I wanted the DVD featuring Shanana Bowser! The one I received had older shows! I am disappointed! Too late to return it now!
5,Great CD for your collection,"This 4 CD set from Proper records is a wonderfull collection. Plus its a great value. For those folks who want or just need a sampling of fine Blue Grass music this is it. Of course there's Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers, Flatt and Scruggs and a sampling of other folks. Yes its just centered on the 1940's and 1950's, but what an era to base a four CD pack. It has a good balance between sacred music and Blue Grass classics. Its great picking and fiddling that will leave you wanting more."
2,Yet another trading book,"Absolutely nothing special at all. Target audience is on par of those reading Elder's Trading for a Living. Teaches a little bit of everything, but nothing very well. An advanced trader should literally be able to flip through the book, look at the charts and infer all that is necessary from this book. The few strong points that I saw were linked to intermarket relationships which Murphy has already written an entire book about."
2,Not easy to use,"I'm not thrilled with the recipe for making this crust -- I think of a ""mix"" as something I need to add only a few ingredients to, but this requires as many extra ingredients as making crust from scratch, and demands a lot of fat. I could have done that using gf flour and saved myself a lot of money."
5,Great gift!,My son has a '79 JEEP CJ. This is the bookthat will help him get it going:-) AND it was here forChristmas!
2,Not good enough,"This book is simply not worth the money. I fully agree with the reviewers who said this book is good for stories ... but useless for teaching you how to drive fast. The practical tips are very few and far between. To be honest, most enthusiasts can give you more useful pointers over a pint of beer than you can get reading this book.If you want to drive fast: practice in your own car (safely) and get yourself some hands-on teaching. If you want to sit yourself on a couch and hypnotize yourself into thinking you can drive faster, read this book.The reason I give 2 stars instead of one is because the stories ARE pretty entertaining. And the pictures are better than in Bondurants book ... But come on: that's not why you're thinking about buying this book, is it ?"
2,"Dull stories, little technique.","I ordered this book, read it, then read it again. Its real help is scarce, and the self-agrandizing stories get dull quick. I've thrown it away."
2,M.A.S.H.,"Thought I was getting the collectors edition but did not. Also, the insert with the show preview was not in the package."
2,whatever,"The 1st three seasons of MASH were fun. I watched,I laughed and after each episode, I felt really good.I suppose some of our more social elite individuals found the 1st three seasons to be sophomoric and a slapstick farce? Whatever!! So anyway starting with the 4th season I found that after each episode I felt more often depressed, than I did really good.But I guess that's the price we must pay, to be enlighted by the socialist elite, about moral and ethical quandaries,and lest we forget, the manifold horrors of war.Need I say it once more? WHATEVER!!"
3,buy it and never use it,If you want to buy something and never use it..this is your product!(I thought it was a great idea when someone at work made the coffee for me!)
3,Makes good coffee concentrate,I recieved a toddy coffeemaker for Christmas but only recently used it. It made a decent amount of concentrate... a caraffe full that keeps fresh in the fridge for 18 days and one ounce of concentrate goes with three ounces of liquid. There are definite drawbacks...1.It takes a pound of coffee to make a caraffe of concentrate... about six cups worth.2.It takes ten hours to steep.3.It uses these thick fibrous filters to brew the coffee. Only two come with the kit. Each one is supposedly good for only six uses. Replacement filters are a little less than four bucks online and come in packs of two.All in all I still like it... just wish it came with more filters or a more reusable type filter.
4,"worked fine, but overkill","the instructions for actually brewing your concentrate with this Toddy are more complicated than you might think. The concentrate concept works well, but ultimately, after buying this setup, we decided that a plain old french press does exactly the same thing, using cold water, as this complicated setup -- without the fuss, filters, top heavy spill prone decanter, etc., with the same exact result. get a big french press and make your cold brew that way."
2,Hype,"I don't know what these other people are talking about. I used this twice just to make sure I hadn't messed it up the first time. The coffee wasn't any different (in fact, a little worse) than if you hot brew a really strong batch and keep it in the frig (which is what I usually do). It's also messy and uses a lot more coffee than hot brewing. I wish i could return it, but I've already used it."
3,Good product - poor customer service,"I have one of these and love it. I just bought one through Amazon for a gift for family and was disapponted that it didn't qualify for ""Prime"".Ordered it 8/28 for promised dely of 9/1 to 9/6 - it's still ""in transit"". Guess what though, my credit card was charged 2 days before shipment. I emailed Amazon and got a form response that didn't answer my question. I'm not doing that again."
2,Not what it was cracked up to be,Takes some doing to make this stuff and the filter always gets clogged and its a bear to clean when its half full of coffee grouds and water. My wife and I didn't think it did justice to what we were looking for. Went to a Espresso maker and we add hot water and it seems to do about as well acidity wise but tastes lots better and its easier to make and less wasteful.
2,Not worth it,This thing is made of very poor quality glass and plastic and is a messy way to cold brew coffee. You can get the same results putting coarsely ground coffee and water in a jar and straining it through cheese cloth. It's a waste of money.
2,"Good Iced Coffee, but used a ton of coffee to produce","I bought this product after reading an article about the Toddy was the best way to produce iced coffee. I placed a 12 oz. bag of $10 coffee in the hopper, and added the recommended amount of water. I had to wait 24 hours for it to fully drip through. Then I added the concentrated coffee to water per the directions. It was great tasting iced coffee, but the entire batch only lasted a few days making it pretty expensive per cup."
2,twice as expensive as regular coffee,"I bought the toddy and am now going to return it.The coffee tastes good but the amount produced per pound of beans is so small the cost becomes very high: following directions exactly I produce 4 cups of concentrate from 7 cups of water, per 3/4 pounds of ground coffee beans. after diluting these 4 cups of concentrate 3:1 with water as instructed, the final yield is 16 cups of coffee per 3/4 pounds, or 20 cups per pound. Based on Googling the question, hot brewed coffee yields approximately 40 cups per pound. Thus, it is exactly twice as expensive to use the toddy as to make hot coffee and cool it. To me that's too much of a premium.Also, the time/energy required brewing Toddy coffee versus traditional coffee is at least 2 to 1. Here again, it's just not worth it.Finally, the cleanup is a pain.While I appreciate the product I'm returning mine"
1,Don't Waste Your Money! Cheaper Alternative...,"I've used this system in a coffee shop for years. Too many parts to wash, etc - this system is super high maintenance, precarious, a waste of money and counter space. Really!All you need is a 64 oz mason jar, a metal sieve, bowl (preferably with pour spout), and storage carafe. You probably own most if not all these items.Dump 3.5 cups (8.7 ounces) of coffee and 5 cups of filtered water into the jar. Cap the jar and shake. Leave to soak for 12 hours. Nest sieve in bowl and dump jar contents in sieve. Poor toddy from bowl to carafe and store in fridge for up to 2 weeks!Enjoy!!"
3,"looks good, has cracks","I bought 6 of these, 1 of them was shattered when it arrived, another 2 have cracks in the corners.Other than that these are good looking frames."
1,Junk,"These frames are cheap and not made well. They often arrive with broken glass and unless you are extremely careful the glass will break when you try to open it up or close it again. Even when they don't break the glass comes scratched. If you want a great frame for a low price check out West Elm. Their frames are well made, come with tempered glass and acid free mat board."
5,Love it,"I'm really happy with the results with both my point and shoot and my megazoom camera.The quality is quite good, the plastic clips used to lock down the telecoping rods looked a little dubios but are very sturdy and strong."
4,Great value,I am really pleased with this monopod. I am over six feet tall and I can use it comfortably.
4,Monopod,"Works good. Very light and portable, has a nice carrying case, and for the money, very good for traveling."
2,Leg lock levers could be stronger,"Well, given the price, I didn't expect any higher quality of the legs; but the leg lock levers are made of thin plastic. I am a heavy user, and I am sure the levers wouldn't last a month. I ended up returning the monopod. As it is, the monopod is good enough for occasional use by the amateur photographer with a light camera. However, if the manufacturer improves the build quality of the lock levers, this could be a great monopod."
5,Marvel! The inner and outer beauty of Mr. M.S.,What a wonderful depiction of Marcus's life and his rise to fame. It's amazing how a person's life can turn around in an instance. Marcus definitely found his while rollerskating. His body represents all that it is art...
4,Eye Candy,"This book is a great depection of a male supermodel who is the most astonishing man I've ever seen. The book is full of great photos of this model, showing us his hot body and its beauty. The only thing that's wrong with this book is that it should show some naked pictures of Marcus, and more homoerotic displays of him. Besides that, it's a good book that will fill your head with some delightful daydreams of sex and passion."
5,Swedish Black Melodeath,"In my opinion, this has more in common with Dissection than In Flames and later Dark Tranquility. Blast beats, black metal vocals, and shredding solos reminds me alot of Storm of the Lights Bane. All of the songs are great, and Anders Friden shows up to sing on Skydancer, while Mikael Stanne shows up for Of Chaos and Eternal Night. Overall, however, I like Of Chaos and Eternal Night better, as it has a more refined sound.Check out Dissection and early Sentenced if you enjoyed this album."
1,Don't bother!,"This is a terrible, stupid, annoying book. One pointless anecdote after another, ninety percent of them being along the lines of ""Well we had this great cat once, she kept having kittens and oh they were so cute. She finally got run over by a car one day and we were sad. We will always remember our wonderful cat.""One story excerpted from a book by Sonia Fitzpatrick abruptly stops several paragraphs before the end. Another seems to be just as stupidly truncated, but I couldn't verify it, as I could with Ms. Fitzpatrick's story.Who are the rest of these people? And why did anyone see fit to fill an entire book with their badly written and (mostly) irresponsible reminiscences? Do yourself a favor, skip this book."
1,Stone cracked 1st time in oven.,The product was in expensive so I didn't expect it would last a long time.However I certainly didn't expect it would crack in the oven during the 1st time use. Buyer beware.
4,Great for Bread!,"I have yet to use this stone for pizza, but let me tell you, it is FANTASTIC for baking artisan bread. I have baked fresh bread for my husband almost daily since receiving it, and the loaves have turned out incredible!Maybe I will actually cook pizza on it one night, as well!"
4,A Solid product,"It works well! Tip: To prevent a soggy pizza crust, heat up the stone inside the oven to a very high temp - 525 or so. Then put your pizza crust on the very hot stone and cook it for a few minutes until it hardens up a little. Pull it out, scrape under the crust so it isn't sticking to the stone, and then add your pizza sauce and toppings."
1,pizza affecinado,"Made great pizza one time, let the stone cool overnight in the oven. Next day stone broke in two right in my hand as I removed it from the oven."
1,wrong battery,The battery I ordered was a 1700mah battery. The one I received was a 1000mah. The company no longer stocks the one I ordered. I received a full refund.
3,Good general summary,"Given the space constraints, this is a concise and well-balanced summary of the war, and synthesizes the usual sources quite well. The ""Battlefield Today"" section is especially nice. The big disappointment is the illustrations, which concentrate on Israeli forces. The few Egyptian photos are well-known and have been widely reprinted in the west, and are poorly reproduced here. The 3 two-page spread paintings are remarkable for their lack of detail. Given Osprey's extensive back catalog of Middle East titles, it's amazing they didn't reproduce any of the much better photos and paintings that graced earlier books. If you're looking to own a single book on the Sinai Front in the 1973 War, this could be it. If you already own standard works like Dupuy, Herzog, Shazly and Pollack, give this one a miss unless you're a completist."
4,Not Bad For The Price,No problems with shipping. Not a bad looking set of tools don't know if they will take heavy use but worked perfect for the 2 phones I had to work on. Pretty nice little storage box too.
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,Bought this for my father for Christmas. It looks like a heavy duty set in the picture. Should have read the desription better or something. Very plasticy and cheaply made tools. They get the job done but I had to go buy more christmas presents so it didn't look like I was insulting him by just getting this. Thought it was a steal because of the price but once I got it it wasn't even worth that price.
5,"For anything A/V, it works great.","I run an A/V business and this has come in handy for in-wall switches, taking apart remote controls, other small electronics and my wife has found a few uses of her own.It has a nice grip and a nice selection of bits as well. It's better than anything I could find at my major hardware stores and I definitely recommend it."
3,"Good kit, but fragile case!","I am giving only 3 stars to draw your attention - OPEN MANUFACTURER'S PACKAGING CAREFULLY! The kit itself is very good, nice selection of screwdrivers to work with almost any kind of small screw. The only complaint is that the case is a little delicate. The packaging material was tightly molded around the item and required cutting it open extensively (not a ""frustration free"" package). When I I forced the case out of the manufacturer's package, I was disappointed to find that both plastic hinges of the case were shattered! I do not know if the case was already damaged, or it was damaged when being opened, but I have to return this item to Amazon for a refund (I am considering buying a new one)."
5,suprised.,I was really suprised at the quality of these bits. At this price range it is kind of a gamble. These are nicely made and very precise.
4,very convenient,"There is a huge variety of bits and they are all magnetical. The case is very durable along with the screwdriver that comes with it. The problem is that the bit tips are very weak and bend REALLY easy. I understand that you should be gentle while using small bits like this, but these tips just hardly have the strength to take out commercial screws and they bend way to easily. They should have coated the tips in something stronger. I probably wouldn't recommend these to a friend."
3,Doesn't heat but looks great,We got this as a wedding present years ago. The bodum looks sleek and doesn't have a cord hanging around. I was so excited to use it but the sterno cups never fit and it did not heat well enough to keep my cheese at the right temperature. We added boiling water to a heated pot to no avail. I started dumping the fuel from the sterno cups directly into the holder and it helped some. I'll try the fuel someone else suggested in the hopes it will help. I've recently purchased an electric fondue pot and am beyond excited about the results.
5,all the fury of a 20 day crack and whiskey bend.,"this is the most powerful,rage filled,addiction lamenting,and just plain old BURLY album i have ever heard in my whole life.it's like a train running into a logging truck.if you like buzzov-en,grief,sleep,black sabbath,mortician,harmony korine's films(gummo in particular) and/or if you've just plain had a horrible life this is THE album for you.you cannot ignore the dank southernness of this album.the production is PERFECT...thick as a brick.put some headphones on,do what ever you do to avoid the pains of life and come join us in the confederacy of ruined lives."
2,Robert,"If you are looking for this book to tell you how to astral project, read the review by blaznlex ""lisa"", then you will know not to buy this book."
1,TOTALLY SELF ABSORBED,"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT BRIAN BOSWORTH FORMER NFL PLAYER. THE BOZ TELLS US OF HIS GREATNESS THROUGH OUT THIS EGO TRIP BOOK. THE ONLY INTERESTING PARTS I FOUND, (AND THERE AREN'T TOO MANY) WAS WHEN THE BOZ WAS TELLING US ABOUT SOMEONE OTHER THAN HIM. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO BE A SELF IMPORTANT, AROGANT, BRAGGERT AND BE TOTALLY FULL OF THEMSELVES AND OTHER THINGS. HE TAUGHT ME THAT HAVING A STUPID HAIRCUT, WEARING EARRINGS, GETTING DRUNK AND MAKING AN A--H---E OF HIMSELF IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A HUMAN BEING CAN DO. A TOTAL PIECE OF GARBAGE."
3,"It's not Relish, but...","...who'd want it to be? Nothing worse than an artist who trots out the same album a second time just to cash in, is there? It wouldn't have worked anyway unless Joan could have come up with another grab-bag of the truly great stuff that Relish comprises. Righteous Love strikes me as a bit more homogenous and focused. In half-a-dozen listenings I'm finding more to like all the time. There are a few weak moments--putting ""My Love is Alive"" on strikes me as a waste of space--but on the whole I think Joan's in fine form, and I'm glad she's back. I saw her at First Avenue in Minneapolis a few days ago, and all the new material smoked live."
4,A Shame to be so Overlooked...,"With the garbage that is out there today, it is such a shame to see Joan Osborne go unnoticed. Righteous Love is a stunning return from a 5 year silence. Perhaps it is this long wait that has made people forget her. Righteous Love, the title track is an amazing high energy, sing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs tour de force, the only regret is that it ends too soon, leaving you longing for one more run of that chorus. The weakest tracks on the album are when Joan doesn't let out her powerful soul. If I was your man, impresses me least, but is still a pleasingly mellow track. Get down and dirty with MY love is Alive, and enjoy the ending climax in Safety in numbers. Pick up this cd and pay respect to a woman who has more than garnered it. In this time of manufactured auditory grabage, RIGHTEOUS LOVE truly has soul and deserves to shine."
5,Brilliant forgotten album,"This album got barely any press when it was released and did not yield any hit singles. But, five years later, it sounds amazing...""Righteous Love,"" ""Safety In Numbers,"" ""To Make You Feel My Love,"" ""Baby Love,"" all the songs on this CD shine, and I can honestly say it's one of the best CDs of the '00s. Trully timeless."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"joan's beautiful voice is too frequently buried in the arrangements, and the songwriting is disappointing. dylan's ability to write beautiful lyrics as evidenced on the final track of the cd reveals how pedestrian the previous songs' lyrics are. somehow i kept thinking joan was trying too hard to be the rebirth of janis joplin and not giving us the original artist she can be."
4,No Relation To Ozzie Osbourne.,"... I think Joan's new cd finds her sounding more mature, moreexperience, more relaxed vocally. There are no songs where Joan singslike she did on ""Right Hand Man"" or ""Let's Just GetNaked"". She sounds silky smooth on songs like ""GrandIllusion"", the Bob Dylan cover ""Make You Feel My Love""and ""Righteous Love"". She adds variety by doing songs like""Safety In Numbers"", ""If I Was Your Man"" and""Poison Apples (Hallelujah)"". Ms. Osborne has proven in twoshort cds that she is here to stay and that she has the voice to standthe test of time. She reminds me of strong female singer/songwriterswho have come before her like Carole King, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell,Laura Nyro and even Stevie Nicks. As I've stated in some of my reviewsbefore, I'd gladly listen to the type of pop music Joan is making thanthe company manufactured brain candy I've been hearing on MTV and theradio in the past three to four years."
5,coolness,I love it. My driver looks very cute and quite professional in it. I highly recommend it to all. Other colors would be cool.
4,Wild Hogs,"This movie was fun, characters were great, scenary was wonderful. William H. Macy was a hoot. Must see for all bike lovers and to see ""Easy Rider"" at the end topped it off."
5,Wild Hogs,"Wild Hogs (Widescreen Edition)We loved this movie. It was hilarious! Good, clean, fun entertainment!"
5,Wild about Wild Hogs,This was a great movie and we enjoyed this dvd. If you want a good laugh this is the one.
5,Lone Wolf Rider loves Wild Hogs,"I'm a Harley enthusiast and ride on a daily basis. I couldn't wait to see this movie after seeing the trailer. I wasn't disappointed! The off beat humor and dynamic cast were an awesome combination. The first thing I did after seeing it was go online to see when the DVD would be available. I've seen it three times in the theater already, and two of my teenage daughters have seen it with me and we all enjoyed it immensely."
4,Funny!,"Very funny movie - great actors, cute story, nice ending. Hits pretty close to home for those of us of ""that age""..."
2,funny-serious,"These men try want to return to teen-hood for a few days. Every time they try to be carefree (irresponsible), it backfires. The good guys win, but it takes the father of all bikers to make it happen."
2,Big Cast Hams It Up in This Little Movie,"Like ribs on the barbie -- A slow starter, but once it got on the road, Hogs was light fare with just enough meat to be entertaining in a soft silly sense. In addition to the four ""stars"" it was fun to see other actors who have been out of the limelight for awhile (Merissa Torme, an over the top Ray Liotta, and Jill Hennessy). John Travolta and William H. Macy are fine actors, but not well suited to the material in the script, which was much more suited to Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence. If you have nothing better to do on a Saturday night, it beats the shopping channels and infomercials."
3,Wild Hogs,I had expected a bit more humor and less corn from this movie and was a bit disappointed. Overall though it was worth watching. As a general rule I am more impressed with Travolta. I also had trouble with Ray Liotta's character. Not the best performances I've seen out of this cast but I did enjoy the movie and a couple of the twists it took.
2,Barely funny,"I hate whoever did the music for this movie. It's annoying and terrible. That aside, most all the jokes fell flat with me. I didn't appreciate the mean spirited homophobic jokes either. Not all gay people are sex obsessed perverts that straight men need to fear. The only funny part was when John Travolta blew up the bar."
3,Juvenile and homophobic,"Apparently if you lump any 4 guys together on a road trip, there is going to be a lot of homophobic hi-jinks. There was so much gay slander jokes in this movie, it really got old quickly. The movie execs must believe the average American movie watcher obviously has the IQ of a caveman, sorry to any cavemen I've offended.The movie also has a lot of slapstick humor, making a Jerry Lewis type character out of William Macy. He klutzes everything up from fights to riding the motorcycle to dancing, to eating chili. This movie could have been about a mid life crisis and taken the subject seriously, and may have gotten a movie that was somewhat thoughtful or interesting. Instead what you have here is a stereo-typing four stooges on Harleys with a good dose of homophobic humor thrown in."
4,No Title,"I was really surprised by Wild Hogs, with such a great lineup of actors, I got a mediocore comedy. Wild Hogs is about four middle aged men who take a cross country trip on their motorcycles to get away from their everday problems. The movie was fine, but the humor was kinda immature. It'll make you laugh, but it's like 8th grade humor."
3,Funny!,"Worth watching just for the actors themselves...who are some of my favorites...movie was predictable, but still provided some laughs and an evening of mindless entertainment."
5,The A Team,Love the GMC Truck which it comes in. The DVDs are great and brings back good memories and its worth every dollar
5,whats this movie all about,the ateam is the must see series of the century it pack full with action adenture and even a little romance
1,The A-Team: Complete Series,The storage van was missing. Artwork for season 1 was missing. All discs were in a dvd page holder. All discs were full of dust & smudges all over them. Price was way too high for the condition of this product. Only good thing is the discs seem to play OK. I feel the price should have been about 1/3 of what was charged. Will not buy from them again & I hope Amazon stops allowing this to happen. JUNK!
4,The A-Team collectible van DVD set,"The DVD set is amazing, however, I was disappointed that the ""collectible"" limited edition van that the set comes in is not a metal tin, but of paper construction. FYI, the 2010 movie based on the TV series is very cool, with perfect casting."
5,A classic and worth the price,"If I had to own one book on software design, this would be it. Everywhere I've taken it, people have wondered if some of the examples were ""their company."" It was introduced to me by a former boss and is easily worth 10x the price of all the courses in ""design"" I had. Most design is done backwards. DeMarco explains why that is."
2,Disappointed,I was quite disappointed with the number of mistakes in this book as I would have liked to have used it as a reference.Many sections were grabbed from research papers which I am familiar with and no attempt was made to keep notations consistent between papers. This meant that as you are reading the notations will suddenly switch on you.I think the undertaking was too ambitious although the topics are quite pertinent.Perhaps the next release will address these problems.
2,Not tall enough,"I tried this out with my ~9 mos old daughter in the store. I liked that it was the cheapest of the bunch. At first she loved and and scooted around easily. However, after a few more minutes of using it, she began to cry. Her shoe pulled off and I saw that her heel was red. I watched closely and saw that her heel kept hooking the back support bar. The other thing, it was set on the tallest setting and it was still too short for her (she's tall and skinny). We ended up spending more money for the Kolcraft. It has more toys (even a removeable music tray which my daughter loves), is much taller, and most importantly, doesnt have a back bar to hook her heel on."
2,???,"I for the life of me could not get the seat to stay in place. It has five straps you have to pull through slits in the back, and three plastic buttons you have to push through holes in the front that slide down. Well great, there is nothing that keeps any of those things in place! The holes in the front were to big to securely snap in and slide down and STAY down, the straps would come back out as she was moving up and down. It would have been 5stars if it was made better. My daughter loved the toy bar. I just went out at and bought another walker from another brand."
5,Soccer player,"I love this walker. I put my son in this when he was 4months, by 5-6 months old he had mastered it. He's favorite game was to play soccer in it. Even once he started crawling he still loved the walker. And he's much safer in the walker then crawling and climbing around. This walker doesn't have as many toys as the others but I found that didn't really matter. He liked the walker because he could explore things around the house, not play with the toys on the walker. These walker was also the only one that he fit in at 4months. The others were just to high, he could reach the floor."
5,Work perfectly with my HP Designjet,"Highly recommended!! It took a some time to install it. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but suddenly it worked and now I don't have to go to a print shop to print my CAD drawings."
5,VerY good,"The product arrived sooner than expected, it worked perfectly and the price is pretty good, I recommend it. had in small setback but it was for a delay in USPS, everything else perfect, the store was responsible to my queries."
3,"My ""take to bed"" book","I didn't expect a clever,involving story that is a great summing up of the strange history of our empire. Every night, I looked forward to reading myself to sleep with this wonderful novel. When I was a boy, I loved fantasy and science fiction, but 99.9% of it is wretched junk for precocious kids or slow-normal adults just up from comic books. This novel employs the devices and conventions of that genre, and drives along with the power of a brilliant, original mind. I was sorry to have it end."
2,it goes nowhere,I too am having trouble finishing this book...I just don't care how it's going to end...A tad boring but essentially harmless stuff.
3,Time Travel - Interesting Premise,"I found the idea of time travel through the Smithsonian Institution intriging and the book started out at a fast pace. However, about half way through it, the story slowed and I had to force myself to finish it."
4,One big knife,"This is a great knife, which I happen to think is well balanced and offers a lot of stability.It is however a very large knife which some might find unwieldy or too heavy. It is significantly bigger than the standard Classic 10"" chef's knife.More importantly, because of the knifes height (width), the blade itself is very wide and would not fit in any standard knife block I could find. In the end I bought the super knife block from Williams-Sonoma and took a router to widen the cleaver slot."
1,Wusthof no classic,"When spending money on a good quality chef knife, quality is expected. Loose fitting handle that rattles for $200.00 is not quality. I returned it and got another one to have the second knife with a rattling loose rivot in the handle. I'll stick with the henkle pro-s and my MAC's. Save your time and energy with this knife. Looks good feels good but the handle blew the deal."
2,story fair for professional writer,"while it is true that Mr. Brady was a Marine and in the Korean War, his writing 45+ years later leaves doubts about it. For example the word Marine is alwaysa used as as proper noun, yet in none of his books does he do this. Secondly, Marines don't wear FATIGUES, they wear UTILITIES. They wear trousers, not pants. Finally, the rank Gunnery Sgt. did not exist during Korea, that rank came out in around '59 or so. The gunny of Korea was a Tech Sdt. for a good book on Korea, read COLDER THAN HELL by Owens, or THE LAST PARRALEL."
4,The sacred path for those seeking the sacred life,"I have her book and have been impressed by her seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of voluminous details of ancient Egyptian religious life and her special gift to organize her ideas in an extremely orderly and accessible manner. She speaks with ease of the pantheon of gods; and her various listings and tables of gods (and her other lists establish everything in their place) fills in what from many other sources are missing details. In her book, one gets the feeling that they are seeing the whole picture whereas in other books in the genre, I feel just some pieces of the jig saw puzzle are there and in (comparatively speaking) a disjointed manner. I'm unread, but of all the books I've encountered on ancient Egyptian life, religious practices, and beliefs, her's is in the top three and in other instances the best there is."
1,Scam operation,"This is obviously a scam operation -- you order presumably a phone with PDA (at a cost of close to $16) and, instead you get a 10 cent highlighter that the scam artists call ""bible highlighter"" Wow! and Amazon is obviously cooperating with the scammers and maybe running the scam itself since similar story was found here beforehand, but I was fooled by descriptions of the phone by other ""customers"" Do not get fooled, the ""customers"" describing the ""phone"" are the scammers themselves. I have sent Amazon a letter threatening them with a lawsuit for running a scam operation. Will see what the response will be. Stay tuned!The ""rating"" is there because dumb amazon does not let you post, without the star rating"
5,Relive the beginning of the series,"Outstanding episodes. These lay the background for the Showtime series which follows after the original movie. I thoroughly enjoy the series. The humor brought to the subject by Richard Dean Anderson and played upon by the other major cast members make it more than just another science fiction adventure. I have enjoyed these and am surprised that the studio has not released many more volumes. I for one, would buy them all.I highly recommend these three shows (on one disk)if you liked McGiver and the movie Stargate. It really gets you involved."
5,Stargate SG-1(Super Great One!),"Stargate SG-1 stars the charming and talented Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neil. This movie basically picks off where the Kurt Russell/James Spader one left off. Colonel O'Neil is once again called out of retirement to enter the stargate, fight some mean alien warriors and save the universe!The cast is top notch, with Anderson at his witty, sarcastic best. The action insequences are great sci-fi fun. The only drawback was that it has an R-rating, for nudity. I believe it was unnecessary and added no depth to the scenes. But overall, it is a great film(althought not for the kids). If you are a Richard Dean Anderson fan ( and who isn't?) you are sure to enjoy this movie. So run..hurry..go buy it - NOW!!"
2,Not for Mac use,I liked the unit until I tried to interface it with my IMac. You have to have the outdated version of ITunes (version 1.0) and Itisn't compatible with the latest operating system - OSX.This I found out after going through an awful customer service hotline at Samsung. Very difficult to get through.So in all reality it is not Mac compatible. Even the service tech finally admitted It.
1,Wrong,The item did not fit my camera even though it was supposed to. Needless to say extremely disappointed and had to purchase something else.
2,Cranberries are Great - Packaging sucks!,"The Klein's Naturals Dried Cranberries were very good. They tasted fresh and were plump - not dried out.The BIG problem was that in half the packages, the inner seal had been broken. How or when that happened is amystery since there is an outer cover to protect the inner seal. So they are not much of a bargain when youend up throwing half of them out."
5,great worship album,Leeland did a great job on this album. Usually I only like 2 or 3 songs on a cd but in this case I really like all 11 songs very much. Each one is a bit different that the other. There is one that sounds a lot like the early beatles. BUY it you will like it.
5,Gunsmoke DVD,I ordered this DVD collection for my Dad for Christmas.He loves Gunsmoke and this is the 50th Anniversary DVD. It has the actors giving a commentary before each episode. He loved it!
4,Very colorful,This puzzle is just hard enough for the avid puzzler. A good price and well worth the purchase. I recommend it.
2,noisy & broken w/in 1 yr,"This shredder is unusually noisy and within one year of purchase, it stopped working. The blades no longer move and even though I've cleared what paper I can see, it still behaves like it's jammed."
2,FANTABSTIC,THIS IS VERY GOOD ALBUM FEATURING FAMOUS WARREN G AND CLIVE ANDERSON IN RAP DEBUT I LIKE MUCH LIKE SUPER AMERICAN FUNK IT IS VERY ENTERTAINED AND FUNN IT IS THE BESTER ALBUM BY CASH MONEY MAKE ME LAUGH ON SKIT HO HO HO~~~~~~ VERY GOOD
3,ok cd,"good cd but some of the songs are boring except project b&*%h. the best songs are project b*&%h by juve,lil' wayne, and big tymers and win or lose by rappin 4 tay"
2,Not worth the aggravation,"When it works, it makes a great cup of coffee. Smooth, strong and not bitter.However, it only works about 15% of the time. If you put in too much water, it boils over and makes a heck of a mess. If you grind the coffee too fine (which happens to me about half the time) it clogs, and doesn't filter down. Too course (the other half), you get weak coffee.It's not worth it. Buy a french press."
4,makes really smooth cup of coffee!,"This makes really smooth/clean-tasting cup of coffee, no coffee residue in your mug. Bit of cleaning-up involved, but fun to use."
4,Great Tasting Coffee!,"Because this coffeemaker was unavailable for a while I was waiting for it with some anticipation. My patience was well rewarded with some fine tasting cups of coffee!It does take a little longer to make coffee than my Mr Coffee machine. The cleanup is a little longer, too. But the difference in taste is worth it. There are limits on the advantages of convenience...However it is important to use a coarse grind of coffee. If the grind is too fine, or if the grind includes too much ""dust"" then the filter will clog. The coffee then never makes the trip down the tube and just sort of sits there, betwixt and between. So just remember to use the right grind and you will be very happy with your Bodum Santos.I also use a Cory glass filter rod instead of the plastic filter included with the Bodum Santos. The plastic one works just fine but the glass filter looks so cool. (The caveat about coarse grind applies to the glass filter rod as well.)Try it! You'll like it!"
3,"Good at times, not great...","I really liked his last CD and was looking forward to a ""live"" version of some of his hits (since I really prefer live music recordings). This CD has its moments, but overall was pretty average. The slow tunes are too long (6+ mins.). And I can't believe he left off ""My kind of Woman,"" one of the best songs on his last CD which would really rock in a live version. ""Sex Machine"" is too long with a bad/boring sax solo. I'll listen to this a lot probably, but I'm somewhat disappointed in overall content."
3,Ok Printer,"We have had this printer in the office for about 4 years now. It still works great but takes a while to print. It's very quiet but sometimes jams when using the front feeder. Over it's ok, but get something newer if you are looking at this printer."
3,"Some good info, but a bit wacky","The Sears' book will give you good, detailed information on what happens during birth and will help you make some informed choices about the kind of birth you want--assuming you have a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy.I didn't find them to be terribly judgmental, but they have a negative view of practically every 'intervention' from ultrasound to fetal monitoring during the birth and they hold up home births as the ideal. I found this to be a bit dishonest... Sure, most women and babies don't need those interventions but they can and do save lives.To me what sums up their attitude is their statement that women today are AS concerned with the ""experience"" of birth as with the outcome--a healthy baby. Of course everyone wants a good experience but by far what's more important is the outcome--anybody who says otherwise hasn't lost a baby."
1,The Birth Book; Everything You Need to Know to Have a Safe,"I was thrilled at the prospect of husband/wife team of authors then I opened this book and was greatly disappointed. If you prefer a birthing center, midwives, and giving birth in water -this is the book for you.If you are looking for a book about routine HMO covered hospital births, ob/gyns, or possible use of anesthesia - this book IS NOT FOR YOU."
1,Read this book with a grain of salt,"This book is increadibly biased. The theme is unmedicated home births attended by your doula and midwife. If you are planning to deliver in a hospital with a ob/gyn and don't want to feel like a failure for considering medication, this book is definately not for you.The book basically blames the majority of things that can go awry on medication and zealous doctors.My biggest complaint is it equates your degree of womanhood to your ability to have a vaginal unmedicated birth. Funny, I never knew the size of my pelvis determined my womanhood.A much better balanced choice is Pregnancy Chilbirth & the Newborn by Simkin, Whalley and Keppler"
2,Unnecessarily negative & judgmental,"As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this book takes an unnecessarily negative approach to modern hospital births and indeed to doctors themselves. It sets a high standard for expecting mothers - akin to ""natural birth or fail"" - which is unhelpful even for those already aiming for a natural childbirth. The judgmental tone, especially in the commentary on the birth stories, is unconstructive and offensive (and this from someone who has successfully given birth naturally). More importantly, the authors practically demonize OBGYNs and modern medical practices by recounting negative events/practices from decades-old hospital birth experiences - many of which are no longer in use. This may be valid historical information, but it serves only to frighten expectant mothers and set up a confrontational rapport between mothers and their OBGYNs.I would instead recommend ""Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn"" for an informative but more balanced perspective."
1,A very dissapointed reader!,"If you are an open minded parent to be, this book is not for you. Mr. Sears expresses time and time again how his wife had all natural births and how much better that is for the baby. I personally think his wife is just one of the lucky few who go through labor pain free. There are many safe alternatives that will allow you to experience a pain free labor and really enjoy it with your partner. I would not even recommend this book"
2,You won't get a badge for courage...,"I loved the Pregnancy Book by these authors so I thought The Birth Book was exactly what I needed to help me understand the process of labor and delivery as a first time mother. However, while most of the information was helpful, I felt like the authors considered you ""less of a woman"" if you choose to use medical intervention (i.e. drugs for pain relief) during labor. Yeah, this book is great for the I don't shave my armpits and eat granola everyday crowd, but let's be honest why should I have to suffer the way my great-grandmother sufferred to have a child. I sufferred enough through five years of In Vitro procedures to get pregnant. I understand pain. But this book in my opinion attempts to guilt women into feeling like they should experience the pain to appreciate birth. Silly, really, isn't it?"
3,"More anti-hospital biased than seems, but good read","I bought this book with the impression that it fairly showed both sides of the natural vs. medicated birth debate. But it clearly leans toward natural births. But it is still a good read if you are trying to decide whether you are going natural or medicated. It makes the medical community seem more ""evil"" than reality. At least in my expereice, the hospital i gave birth at is very accomidating to the mother's wishes and encourages many natural practices first. SO this book can freak you out, and make you more fearful than need be. But yeah, this book helped me out, and was worth reading."
5,Single most helpful book for me in preparing for childbirth,"I found this book incredibly reassuring, user-friendly, and full of resources in preparing for the birth of my first child. I was pretty freaked out by labor but this book helped me a lot. It is especially helpful for those considering a natural birth, either at home or at the hospital. I appreciated that it was not fear-based as some books on natural birth are. I also appreciated the multitude of helpful explanations of how to effectively manage labor pains and how to include your husband in supporting you through the labor. The provision of numerous pain management techniques, as opposed to just one, makes this book even more helpful. No matter what choices you ultimately make for your labor, this book is worth picking up as an information-rich, valuable and helpful read."
5,A real best book for our ANALOG IC design engineer.,"I am an analog IC design engineer in Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector, I have read this book in our company's library. It's really a very useful book for our designer. Particularly, the topics which include advanced current mirrors and opamps, sample and holds, voltage references give me more helpful in my pipeline Analog-Digital Converter project. It's sure this book make me familiar with more circuit structure, and improved analytical skills through the more useful example. Among our CMOS IC design engineers, many design engineer think this book is more suitable for us to design high performance analog IC."
5,Makes a world of difference,"I just moved to a new rental - I have a small window in my bathroom that looks out onto a patio, and I live with a few housemates. For the first week or so I was living there, I was nervous every time I took a shower because anyone outside could look in! Luckily I found this window film on Amazon and was able to solve the problem cheaply and easily. It went on in a second (I found the cutting part pretty easy too - don't know what people are talking about) and looks professionally done. Provides quite a high level of privacy, but still lets light in."
5,Brilliant,"A story about maturing of a childhood friendship amongst three men - so brilliantly done it's so relate-able it wouldn't matter men, women, girls, boys no matter what age, the friendship story triumphs with a dream adventure that seals it even more, and what could one ask for with it being done in one of the most beautiful countries of the world. Makes you want to go there, do all the fun stuff, and with your best friends too...."
1,arrived broken twice,"this bird feeder has a serious quality issue - terrible!! the frame around the bottom was not attached on the first one I ordered. But I did like the look of the feeder and the rest of the construction so I decided to try again. I exchanged the feeder for another one. When the second feeder arrived the same frame work came out of the box with the packing!! Completely not attached to the base!! Same bad quality issue... no exchange this time. At least Amazon is excellent to deal with, but dont buy this feeder!!"
5,One of the Best,"I have been watching and rewatching this film since it was released. This movie became one of my favorites after seeing only the first 30 minutes of it. The story frollows a priest struggling with his own faith as he acts as postulator for the cause of a woman whom the people have petitioned Rome to make a saint. Ed Harris (as Father Shore) was perfect for the part, the viewer truly believes that he is a priest struggling with his faith while being surrounded in a cause for the faith. Anne Heche was also the perfect choice to play the daughter of the woman to be cannonized. If you are looking for a film to lose yourself in and become a part of this is the one."
5,amazing guitar playing,This album contains some exquisite playing and excellent arrangements of Irish music. I really liked the lyricism of Feeley's interpretations and the lack of cliches you find in many Celtic guitar music collections. This is an absolute gem.
3,did the author run out of time?,"The book reads well, a bit jumpy, but fun none the less. The characters are interesting. After 3 (possibly 4) murders, we finally get a suspect...and then the book ends. It seems like the author was about to give us an ending, then ran out of time. Very disappointing to go that far and get absolutely no satisfaction."
3,What ending?,"I was enjoying the book and it's characters, regardless that it only cost $.99, then I got to the last page....huh.....where's the rest of the book......who committed the 4 murders?? If sheriff Ray doesn't do any better than this at catching murderers then I fear he will never get re-elected and ""the"" Hammer will be in the next book as sheriff. I know this is a first book, so I'll go one more and let's hope I don't once again get to a final page and find that there are now additional murderers running around Lake Michigan who ""got away withit"". PS......hint to Aaron...it would be nice to know who murdered the 4 persons and if it was for the reason given in the book."
1,Amateur,"First problem is there is no ending. Characters come and go with no relevance to the story. It is as if the author couldn't figure out what to do next. There was no sign of any planning to the story. He obviously wrote without any outline or purpose.The characters have no personality; are not complete. There are few descriptions of people or places to put you into the story.A good work puts you into the scene, lets you see the people and places in your mind's eye.There is none of that here.A waste of time and $.99"
2,"Mediocre writing, mediocre plot, weak ending","The writing is what you'd expect from an amateur. Dialog is very literal and reads as if written by a 10th grader. Character and relationship development is weak and not believable. But it was only 99 cents, so I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Butter Pecan Cake Mix,This cake mix does not taste like its name. I would not recommend it to others and gave most of it away
4,Clumpy...,"The mix was a little lumpy...had some hard chunks that would NOT dissolve, they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter. The mix was not expired, it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage. Still came out o.k. and tasted great."
1,To be avoided,"When it works, it works very well. Unfortunately, it seems to spend most of its time trying to pair with other Bluetooth devices (mobile phones?) resulting in numerous breaks in the music. Sat quietly with no-one near you it is excellent, but on a crowded train or walking down busy streets it is awful. The constant breaks in playback make it unusable. I know it's not the Sony Bluetooth headset, because if I pair them to my phone or Mac I have no issues with breaks of service. Even on busy trains.Another gripe is the battery; it lasts about 6 hours, but is very poor at keeping the charge. If you don't use it for a few days you will need to charge it up again as the battery will be flat. And yes, I always turn the unit off when I have finished with it - the battery just runs down."
1,Wagner power Trim It,This product was a big waste of money. It was hard to get to work and when it did it dripped paint all over the place.
4,Very nice movie,"I am french , and this movie is french , directed by Georges Lautner who is a great director and very succes in France . I have buying this american VHS , because , I haven't find it in France , and the original soundtrack is played ( with other ) by the French artist Christophe .Thank you . I hoe vey soon this VHS on DVD in France ."
5,Use to make your on Lactose Free Milk,"You can take two of the capsules, grind them up in a pestle or whatever method you have to grind them down to a fine powder, which is easy. Then take the powder and drop in a gallon of milk and shake. Give it 24 hours and you will have very cost effective lactose free milk. This is the same enzyme everyone uses to convert the lactose to glucose, just in a dry format. You can actually tell that the milk is a bit sweeter after 24 hours. This is much cheaper and easier to manage than the liquid drops others offer to do the same thing. Glucose strips show that it works well. This can save you hundreds of dollars over the course of a year.Link to the Pestle I use on Amazonhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG6EDK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=losth-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=217145&creative;=399369&creativeASIN;=B000GG6EDK"
2,Great product. Stupid price,I love this product but feel ripped off because I purchased it at Costco for $18.00! So I paid double! If you don't have a Costco card find a friend who does - it's worth the extra trouble.
3,Hard as nails!,"Product is less expensive than leading brand name, just a lot chalkier, harder. It does work, esp. with Greek yogurt, which I love!"
1,Sickening,A sick movie made by sick people for sick people (I guess I am in the category too since I was stupid enough to watch the whole thing. When it ended I felt sickened by it.)
2,"This movie is sick, but it is supposed to be!","This is a really fun film if you want to see a wallflower go over the edge, and if you like campy gore and surreal weirdness. The castings of Carol Kane and Molly Ringwald as character types they have never played before adds to the effect. See it if you think you can take it, but don't plan to eat afterwards."
1,"GROSS,BORING,AND JUST PLAIN BAD","This movie should have never been made. I mean I sat down and forced myself to finish it because I thought mabye it would have a good ending, but no I was just grossed out and I MEAN I NEARLY THREW UP! This movie is a waste of time,money,and a good cast. Please don't see this utter peice of garbage."
4,Softcover is very Thin,"The only issue I have with this book is the softcover is very thin and bends easily. Other than that, it's the book that I needed. Delivery time wasn't amazing but it was acceptable."
1,Seriously Do Not Buy This Flash,"First off, its a little tricky to figure out which way the batteries go on, but thats obviously no reason not to buy this. The real reason is because it doesnt work. Out of 40 Test shots with the flash directly in front of the camera, the flash went off 0 times. The light sensor on this flash is right on the front of it, which means it was in optimal position and i switched through each mode after 10 shots each. The ONLY times i got this flash to go off was when i hit the manual flash button on the back, and even then it didnt work all the time. This flash is worthless, you'll just waste your money if you buy it, not to mention the time you waste when you send it back."
4,Tango's for gringos,"If you like Argentine style tango you won't like this cd, but if you are like me and like tango played romanticly, and with lush stringed arraingements, instead of the harsh icy sound of the argentine way, then you will love this recording, I only wish that the original albums from which this cd was compiled were available in their entirety."
3,Not impressed,I bought this to cover my light blue Boppy that I had used for my boys since I was having a girl. I was disappointed with the quality. It was kind of thin and I could see the light blue through the cover. For the price and the name brand I expected something much better. I could have made one much better and cheaper.
4,Eastenders star turns to song-WOW!,The first time I heard this song while visiting England I thought it was great. The song wil uplift you with it's subject about having someone there to make life better. A must have.
5,Work well,These style & Brissell bags work well. It is getting harder to find in your local stores and I'm glad Amazon has them. They are made to the Brissell specs.
1,The Savage Planet less than expected,Savage Planet Box SetThis was ok but I expected something of the caliber found in David Attenborough's nature videos.It was greatly inferior to those. Perhaps I am spoiled.Good for a not to deep overview of storms volcanos etc.
5,Can't help but love it!!!,"This movie is so cheesy it's ridiculous, but you can't help but have a huge smile on your face every time you watch it.The plot is obvious and the characters are clearly cast and dressed to create interest (thanks for that - I wish all movie villains could look like Lucy Diamond). This is like Charlie's Angels with a mild lesbian twist - I say mild, as you don't really see much.If you're out to watch a no brainer with a lot of fun, you'll love this movie."
4,Lesbian Charlie's Angels,"This film could have had a bit more with the girls being physical with each other, but overall it was entertaining and has a good soundtrack. These two girls had good chemistry and they are cute together."
3,Does not fit all dishes,"This rectangular dishpan has been a workhorse for rubbermaid...but I need the square model that has been discontinued from production. The product measurements are to the outside of the rolled lip at the top and do not give you any idea that an 11"" dinner plate will NOT fit into the bottom of the pan. In fact the plate hits the sides and sits at about 20 degrees...half out of the wash water you've put in the pan. It looks like I have to go with the Sterilite dishpan from Walmart it's measurements are also to the rolled lip at the top but the 14.125"" width gives me a chance that an 11"" dinner plate will fit inside the dishpan. My last pan lasted more than twenty years so rubbermaid's plastic is of the highest quality...just wish I could find the 14.45"" square model. :("
5,Rubbermaid Dishpan,"I was spending far too much time looking for one of these at different stores that used to carry them, but no longer do. In desperation I looked for them on the internet, and was glad to see that they are still available, it's just that the folks who know better what I want than I do have decided to stop carrying them. I almost bought them through Amazon, but saw that Rubbermaid's web site says they are carried by RiteAid, True Value, and Ace Hardware stores. And indeed they are, for the same price or less than listed here at Amazon."
3,how do you rate a dishpan?,"it's a dishpan. it arrived quickly, looks exactly the way it was described and replaces the one I had to throw away. decent value."
5,The High Performance Organisation,"This book provides vital answers on how to build a workforce that is engaged and high performing in an everchanging world. ESSENTIAL reading for any Human Resources Manager in the 21st century. Jenny Z., Master of Business (Human Resource Management)."
4,More Uses Than You'd Think,"Vise-grip products are pretty sturdy and can take a lot of abuse. The sheet-metal tool is no exception. It not only will clamp and hold a wider surface area than other grips, you can use it to get a nice, crisp fold in a variety of metals. Sheets that are longer than the jaw of the tool are not a problem--you can just move the tool along and there is no buckle or fold between the placements.I'm a tinsmith, and I use this tool pretty regularly. There are more expensive such tools around, with compound action, etc., but unless you use such a tool professionally and/or on extremely heavy-duty material, this is the best bang for the buck. And, once you have one, you'll wonder how you went so long without it."
4,Good,"Good price, good product, fine service, what else is there?Only ""issue"" is the flat area has a bit of a bow; clamps the outside edges without clamping the center of .040 or thinner materials."
1,Poor Sound won't erase properly,"What is the use of owning a digital recorder if it comes with more ""hiss"" than a tape? This unit has VERY loud background noise and as stated earlier...won't erase individual files."
4,Good Recorder,"This recorder is not made to capture your attention. So as far as design goes, I dont judge it. I judge the performance, which could be excellent if not for the background noises. To the person who said it doesn't erase individual files it does. You have to hold the erase button on the file you want to erase the while the file is flashing press it again, presto its gone. Because i'm not judging on style but for performance I give this recorder a 4/5."
3,PICTURE IS NOT WHAT THE PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE,"If you are buying this because it looks nice and it looks small, DON'T. Because the picture shown IS NOT the voice recorder model offered.Besides that, it works fine and has a great range. I recorded professors in big lecture halls and the sound was good, even better with headphones... Also, regarding a post above, OF COURSE you can delete individual files, the person writing the review obviously didn't read the manual."
1,Good thing it has the lifetime warranty...,"I purchased this luggage from a department store over some much cheaper options because it seemed like it was well-made and was light weight, and it had a lifetime warranty. Plus, it was available in a color other than black.On the first trip one of the wheels broke off. The plastic that housed that it just snapped. It occurred when the bag was only moderately loaded and I just went over a doorway threshold.Additionally, the zipper on the liner lasted one open-close cycle before it pulled off entirely. I was able to put it back on and tighten it with pliers, but it comes off again whenever I try to use it.I am glad I will be able to exchange it for store credit toward a different brand rather than using the lifetime warranty."
4,From the makers od excite bike 64,"I Been waiting patiently for this game, another gamecube only, it's really cheap so go get it now"
2,"Audio CD edition: Great story, bad design","This is another great Raymond Chandler story, well performed by Elliott Gould. However, I can't believe that on each CD there is one 50-minute track. In other words, there are no bookmarks (other books on CDs usually have bookmarks about every 5 minutes). This means that if you stop in the middle of a CD, you will have to fast-forward 25 minutes worth of reading when you want to continue the story, which is inconvenient, and almost impossible on many CD players (they skip around after a while). I have many of these Chandler stories on tapes (Dove Audio edition). Those start with a little ""jazzy"" tune, which puts you right in the mood of the story. This is a detail and a personal preference, but I regret that the Millennium Audio edition doesn't have that tune."
4,lovely book,"written during the depression, a simple book with good pictures and a fine message...you may find what you are love most, is home!"
5,A Dust Bowl Treat,"A Hard Dry Road is a very fine work of fiction with characters quirky enough to be interesting and common enough to be real. Through them Karen Brown exhibits some keen insights into the human foolishness of keeping needless secrets.Karen Brown is an excellent storyteller with a loose and easy style that effectively gets to the point but never seems to be contrived or to be forcing issues on the reader. Her mechanics are flawless -- a rare find these days. It was a joy to read something so well-written and yet as relaxed and natural as an evening stroll.This book was highly entertaining from first page to last, and I thoroughly enjoyed my trip down A Hard Dry Road. My thanks to Karen Brown for taking me along."
2,Not the best of the Casca books.,Not the best of Sadler's books. OK but slow starting and never really picks up.
3,Nice and portable - better than nothing.,"This folding potty seat is nice and portable though a little flimsy. I'm not sure the weight limit on it, but just be careful. I do like it though, because it's better than putting baby directly on a public potty or on that paper liner."
3,Good for public restrooms,"This folding seat is small enough to tuck away in a bag. It holds my child who is over 30 lbs. It doesn't really fit on any of the seats that we've used it for. But it does what it is supposed to do; it gives my child the added assurance of not falling into the toilet! There may be better ones out there, but for the price, it serves it's purpose."
1,grandma,Thought this potty seat would be great for twin grandkids when out and about town. They weigh less than 30 pounds and it collapsed in when they sat on it. would not recommend this product!
1,It DOES pinch!,"First of all, the hinge on its back folds up everytime the child moves a little bit and therefore PINCHES the bottom!Secondly, pictures on the box are all misleading....it only covers the front 1/2 or maybe less of the potty seat.Thirdly, the ""travel bag"" thats included in the pack is a lousy ""ziplock"" storage bag...that too the kind which doesn't even have an ""easy zipper""!!!I would rather keep a box of clorox wipes in my diaper bag to clean the public toilet seat before use!"
2,Does not fit elongated seats!,This product does not fit on elongated toilet seats as specified in the product description.
4,Good for out and about,"This folding potty seat will fit any toilet. Any reviewer who says otherwise is probably not doing it correctly. It sits on top of the seat and outside in the front, so it doesn't matter the shape of the toliet. The seat seems a little flimsy and it does slide around a little bit. However, it works and it keeps my little one from touching the toilet with his hands, which he does when I use another potty seat."
4,potty seat,This seat is the reason my daughter is potty trained! My daughter was having major issues with going to the bathroom in public! I bought this and WOW!! Overnight she was potty trained! I do keep this is a large ziplock along with some wet ones wipes to clean the seat after each use! This seat it a little flimsy and can pinch there litte tush but once you figure it out it's all in the past! I have reccomended this to all my friends!Gave this 4 stars only for the fact it's bit flimsy but better than the others we've tried!
4,A necessity but too small,"Our daughter is afraid of the big toilets so we got this seat for when we are out and about and need to use a public rest room.. sturdy enough too. But my only complaint is that the opening is too small and not matter what we try, she ends up soaking her pants :/ We still use it b/c she won't go without it, but bring a change of clothes everytime!"
1,Terrible Potty Seat!,"Do not buy this potty seat-it is awful! I take plenty of time to fit the seat properly on the toliet and when I try to put my 2yo daughter on it, it slips around. My daughter is not comfortable on it at all and it pinches her bottom. Every single time I have used this she pees all over herself and the floor also because this seat has to be positioned all the way to the front of the toliet and there is not enough room for her to slide back enough so she has space to potty. Then it slips around and practically falls off the potty when I try to take her off of it. I am going to sell it in my garage sale-it is worthless."
3,Don't use it much,"I liked the idea of my son not sitting on a dirty public toilet in theory, but in practice i don't want to lug this huge seat with me wherever i go. Maybe once my daughter is being potty trained i will feel differently but for a boy i just as easily use a paper seat cover when i need to. He also doesn't feel secure on it. It slides easly off the toilet so you have to hold it and your child the entire time. Not great, not horrible."
4,take along potty seat,"Easily cleanable, non-pinching, fits nicely in my large purse or in the diaper bag. Fits both on my home toilet and on toilets in stores. We haven't used it very much, as my son and daughter don't want to go to the bathroom when they're not at home, and it doesn't have an enticing, colorful design to help convince them to try.Over all, I reccomend this product, but one with an interesting design might be better."
5,"Well-made, great product!",This seat folds up nicely and is well-made. Plastic is thick and supports my daughter (28 lbs.) well. The seams don't pinch her or anything.
2,Not good for boys,"This is not a good product if you have a boy.My son is 2.5 yrs old and is doing pretty well with potty training but most commercial toilet seats are so big and have such a large gap in the front that his legs get hurt trying to sit on the seat. I thought this would work similar to the other toddler seats that fit on the inside of the toilet seats.It was tricky to figure out how this was supposed to fit on the seat. I finally figured out it fit on the front of the toilet seat. But there's nothing to block the front and it sits too high off the main toilet seat for a boy to tuck ""it"" down far enough. So I had to use a wad of toilet paper in front so my son didn't spray me or his clothes.I would only recommend this if you have a girl!"
4,"looks like it will work great, but what bag?","this looks like just the product we needed, and my daughter can open and close the seat on her own, and it feels super sturdy, at least for her 27 pounds. The only thing that leaves me wanting is that there is no ""bag"" - it was mentioned in the dialog but it came in just a zip lock type bag, and that was slightly torn because it was what the seat was packaged in. I don't really think you can call that a product feature. I was hoping it was a draw string type bag that could be hung in the bathroom stall or something, but for $8 I guess I could be okay with it and just find something to keep it in that can be hung up. Otherwise I'm very happy with it."
4,good product,"I just received (yesterday)the seat and tried for first time on a public bathroom. It works fine, I have 2 and half years old twins and I was so happy that my little girl was seating on her own toilet ring without touching the restaurant's toilet seat. As other reviews say, you have to place the seat at the very front of the toilet, kids can hold on to the handles (love that). After use it you have to clean it and put it inside of a bag. It works fine for me."
2,Havent found a potty it works on yet!,"I had high hopes for this seat. I was very excited to get it. I have attempted to use it at two different restuarants (Olive Garden being one, the other a local place) and it does not fit. I tried it at the top, middle and bottom near the opening. I even tried it with the seat lifted up. I like the idea of it but it does not work."
4,Works as anticipated!,This seat has worked well for us. Its compact and fits in my bag easily. My daughter grabs the little handles in the front instead of touching the toilet which is a big ick factor for me. She is about 25lbs and it holds her easily and she seems very comfortable with it. I would have liked a fitted washable carry case to come with it but I use one of my wet/dry cloth diaper bags and it works okay if not a little big.
5,PERFECT,"IT was every thing you'll hope for! EVERYTHING!!!!!It has just variety of artists and songs. IT's a mix of many kinds of music, from rap to pop. Wow 2002 is also a really aewsome cd. THe lyrics are good, you get get a lot out of them.hope this helped a bit-it's for all ages too. I'm 13 and all my friends and every one i know like it.from saddle girl #1"
1,Not what I expected!,I would love to return the CD and get my money back. This CD was a big disappointment for me. I have only listened to it once and I couldn't listen to the whole thing then. I feel robbed!
4,Good selection,"The WOW 2003 hits DVD contains a wide variety of music videos from the music album, and I was pleasantly surprised by some of them! Although I had my favorites, most of the videos are well done and deserve credit for that. There are also a couple of duds, but I won't mention any names. All in all, it's a good deal and a great addition to any DVD collection, especially for music lovers, WOW fans, or those looking for something new to listen to. Enjoy!"
1,You have got to be kidding,"Yet another lousy book by IDEO. The whole book is nothing but photos. The title ""Observations on Intuitive Design"" implies to me that they are Jane Fultons observations. Sadly they are not. They are YOUR observations from looking at the pictures. And I paid for this. No written content (to speak of). I'll save you some money; take your camera into a supermarket, a compusa, and a walmart and snap away. Then go home and review them. Done and I saved you some cash. The arrogance of these guys. They slap their name (IDEO) on a collage and call it observations?"
2,took me forever to read it,"I tried to read this book, just couldnt get into it for whatever reason. starts out nice but drags so much; people talk on and on way too long with nohing interesting to say; did 't finish reading it.I guess u know something sucks when u dont care who was the killer LOL.Again it could be my taste and someone else could like it."
2,Curiously boring....,"for such a horrendously evil serial killer and his many innocent victims, the twists and turns of the case, etc. Hard to imagine how the author could have made the topic so dry with this much awful raw material. It's as if the author just quoted the police blotter to describe each crime and victim. Not much insight. This particular criminal and his crimes deserves a much better writer."
3,Film about colonialism and Cameroon,"This was a pretty good film, but it was more documentary-style and it got kind of boring. This wasn't because it was more documentary, but because it was just boring and disjointed.Beware, if you rent the movie from this site, there are no subtitles, so be prepared to be fluent in French. :)"
5,"Excellent, enthralling,emotional, truly a classic comp.",With exciting beats and moody musical themes in each song this album takes you on a mood changing ride as you drift ever deeper into a fantastic world. If your a fan of the more moody techno titles than this is a sure thing. Even if you enjoy more of a Rave style this is a must buy
3,Isn't nearly as good as the original TranceGlobalNation,"For those of you who have the original TranceGlobalNation, don't expect too much. Although this CD isn't bad, it's not nearly as good as the first one, and 5 tracks from the original TranceGlobalNation are present in this one too. Worth borrowing, but not worth buying"
2,Not one of the better Kurland books,"Based on my love of This is all I ask, I am making my way through Kurland's stories. This book started out well, but after Kendrick lost his ghost status, the story dragged. I didn't like Genevieve as much as I wanted to. She was child-like and not strong."
4,A Lady in Distress?,"Lynn Kurland has come up with a unique plot: dreamy American female inherits a 13th century castle as well as its handsome ""knight-in-shining armor"" ghost. Ms Kurland allows her hero ghost to have a sense of humor which he displays by creating illusions so that he can joust or swordplay for exercise, appearing to unsuspecting humans in blue jeans and a Raiders sweatshirt,driving a Jag, or critiquing NFL games he watches on TV. His companion ghosts help enliven the plot. Add attempted kidnapping and murder plus a ghost that gets another chance at life, and you have a book that is hard to put down."
1,Consider the source,"I am truly shocked anyone can give credence to these unfounded claims. There is no proof Elvis was like this and in fact evidence shows him to be quite kind. Guralnick ruined his book using this as a source. How can people like himself or even Nash really think Elvis Presley would be loved today if he were the man this book says his is? Marty, Billy, and Lamar are not credible as their earlier clams (kinder of course) directly contradict this work. How come their stories get so much ""better"" over time? Hopefully one-day people will realize who Elvis really was."
1,"Yes, narrow.","This book does nothing to dispell the debate about what the Bible literally ""says"" about ""homosexuality"" even in its literal context.For what some characterize as ""homosexuality"" (i.e.; a modern gay lifestyle) did not exist. Needless to say, the book offers no insight at all about our own times. But even this is besides the point. People (no matter what their sexuality) who are self-fulfilled and leading their own lives need no ""compassion"". This book is a misguided and biased piece of work entirely."
5,Sooo Much Fun,I have two boys ages 6 and 4 1/2 they love this I Spy! They can both play it themselves but I love sitting with them and playing too. Its great when you just need a little kid down time.
5,Love this game!,"I bought this for my son, who will be four in three months. He loves this game, he is always asking for it. He needs a little help sometimes(the age range is 6-10 years old) but he wants to do it more by himself now. I think it's a great game and there is more to do than I expected. There are three ""levels"". The first where you solve the I Spy games and earn a puzzle piece for each room you complete. Then they put the puzzle pieces together. Then they do the same thing but this time, instead of puzzle pieces, they get secret ingredients to make a soup. The third level they have to earn ghost machine parts and they get to make ghosts. Well worth the money."
1,aweful and can't believe I paid so much!,"terrible product, taste nothing remotely like Belgian chocolate. Made chocolate chip cookies with them and turned out terrible. Not worth the money."
2,Target Hanger (save your money),"Took it to an outdoor range and broke it the first time out. You have to be an excellent shot to miss the middle brace (which I didn't), then the hanger fell to the ground. Good idea, but not for anything stronger than a rubber bullet."
2,There Must Be Better Burleigh,"I had never heard any of Burleigh's work prior to this disc. Unfortunately, this one is let down by some careless and campy singing, mostly by tenor Steven Cole. The complete lyrics are given in the booklet and on the second song, written in ""Negro"" dialect, Cole can't seem to decide whether he is a gay field hand or a swishing dandy about town, neither one of which really fits the song. Aside from his delivery, he keeps forgetting the dialect and when he does remember it, he doesn't really know how to pronounce it. On the fifth track, he is all swishing dandy. Barf! Anyway, I will seek a better sample of Burleigh's work."
5,slamming alternative metal,"If you like Godsmack but you are dissapointed with the last two releases check out Slur. Slur comes complete with killer guitar riffs, vocals that range from 80's influenced singing to nu-metal hollaring and a great mix that cranks out at loud volumes. Oh and guitar solos which seem to be extinct these days. Check out the first single Who I Am, it is all over radio right now you cannot miss it."
4,christmas present,I bought this game for my husband for christmas and he said it was fun. it was great. yippee skippy!
2,"More Selma, Please","If you're interest in this movie is based on Selma Blair, you'll probably be disappointed. Not that Selma isn't great in her part as the seventeen year old ""play-thing"" of an extremely rich and perverse old man, but her part is small despite top billing. If you're looking for skin, the best you're going to do is Selma in her pink undies. Which may be worth it for some die-hard Selma fans. As for the movie itself, if you're looking for a modern day ""L.A. Confidential"", this isn't it. Though it is a ""whodunit"", I'm still not quite sure who did what and I'm not sure I really care. Then again, my main interest was Selma, so I could be bias."
4,Steamy and hot!,"It's a must for your lesbian video collection! The story and acting are sometimes a little clanky, but not at the most important scenes; it's well worth to watch. However, I'm glad that I saw the movie BEFORE I read some of the reviews here; they give the story away. And I do not remember any perversion, especially incest in the movie, as another previewer noted. I guess I can include the following since others already gave it away: The only problem is that it plays into the very outdated notion that the lesbian characters have to get killed by the end of the movie (or must turn out to be murderers). Shame on the film makers!"
5,"Wow, Another Great Keith Whitley Album",I find myself going between George Jones and Keith Whitley Albums/Songs. This Album falls inline with all of Keith's past records with pure emotion and great songs. I wish I could find the on Vinyl though.
5,Great little stroller!,"This is a great little stroller for me as I am in Japan where you really need a stroller that fits in small spaces. The stroller is very sturdy but light which is great for quick trips in and out of the car. The recline is good for my 4 month old but I did put a neck insert in for extra support when she falls asleep. The basket is decent size for this size of stroller(will fit small purse or diaper bag). It folds very nicely and has the handle on the side for carrying. Another thing I like about it is that the canopy is hugh and covers my daughter completely. I love the fact that it comes with all the accessories too! I really don't have any complaints exept that the handles don't adjust so a taller person might say that they are too short(I'm only 5'2""). Overall I would recommend this stroller to anyone."
1,oscillates between primitive and boring,"Yes, I own multiple Japanese DVD and this one right on the bottom of everything. It tries to repeat Pink Eiga movies but most important part--imagination is missing. I can recommend The glamorous life of Sachiko Hanai if you are in the mood for real imagination or stick to internet where multiple web sites give everything for free."
3,Documentary,This video is more of a documentary of what not to do on a train than anything else. Not at all what I thought it may be.
5,Very Good Quality and Easy Assembly,"These stools are solid, very comfortable, and look good. Assembly was straight forward and very easy. An excellent value for the money spent."
4,"Boraam Augusta 29"" bar stool",Bar stools were actually nicer than pictured and are very rich looking in the kitchen; they required some tools for putting them together. They arrived promptly and the nicest part is that they had free shipping.
4,Makes the complicated easy to understand,Using this currently for a cataloging graduate class; much easier to understand then AACR2 readings in alternate text. I like the style of writing and helpfulness of the examples and structure. An excellent resource.
5,ENCHANTING,"This collection of poems and remembrances by Jackie Kennedy's daughter is wonderful and endearing. You are taken immediately into her World,into her life, her dreams and passions. The book itself is small enough to tuck into your purse, beautiful enough to be left out on a table,perfect for giving to someone you love. Jackie was a woman of whom we can all be proud, for she gave us beauty and grace, wit andwisdom, love which transcended time and eternity. She was, in a word, our own Queen."
2,Not so Much,"I am a fan of Linda Lael Miller but I found this book to be a bit monotonous. The way Jolie kept refering to Daniel as ""Mr. Beckham"" and he to her as ""Mrs. Beckham"" drove me crazy. I found myself skipping pages and skimming through chapters. I knew the ending far before I got to it. I did finish the book and I liked the story. I just didn't like the way it way expressed."
1,I managed to finish it.....,"Daniel's Bride had so much potential but it had too many flaws. Jolie keeps forgiving Daniel- I wanted to pinch her every time she allowed Daniel to ignore her or say cruel things to her and then she'd forgive him and they would have supposedly great sex. Come on. Instead of having empathy for Daniel, I found him very shallow. There are stubborn characters and then there are annoying ones.And what about Nan's story...OK, I won't go into that.I honestly don't know how I made it to the end of the book. I guess I was just hoping it would get better."
2,Don't buy until you listen to the disc you are buying!,I have purchased two separate copies of this recording at different locations. The first was unlistenable because of loud surface noise. The second was a little better but the noise was still clearly audible at places. To the naked eye the playing surface of both these CDs was clean and unmarked. I am not an audiophile so I am sure a real expert would find these discs totally unacceptable.
2,Earbud not compatible with Sonyericcson T226,"The charger works fine. Be forewarned, the earbud is not compatible with a Sonyericsson T226. The product details say it is compatible with ""Sony T200 series phones,"" and the earbud close-up photo shows a jack that would be compatible with a Sonyericsson T226 (a ""T200 series phone?""). The earbud itself uses a 2.5mm jack, and that is not what the Sonyericsson T226 uses (it uses a propriety connection). Amazon made good on this for me, but, if you are looking for a kit to work with a T226, this is not it."
1,Nothing,I've used other hoodia products that helped me curb cravings. Tried this cause liquid form is supposed to be more potent and/or act faster. Waste of money. Just bad tasting water.
5,A wonderful 1st book recommended for reading on Lakota.,"This book relays the last ""untold"" years of Black Elk's life as a Holy Man, as told to the author by Lucy Looks Twice, Black Elk's daughter. Although Black Elk's headstone states his birth as 1850, he considers his birthdate to be December 6, 1904, feast of St. Nicholas, which was the day he was baptized and his name became Nicholas Black Elk. A wonderful first hand account by Michael Steltenkamp of Black Elk. A must to read."
4,HALAKU (1956),"Aga Pervesz (Ajit) and Khatum Naellofer (Meena Kumari), both of Iran decent, are lovers. But Khatum's father is not in agreement with their wedding. He eventually agrees and asks Aga to get jewellary for their wedding. Aga goes off to another town, but in the mean time Halaku's (Pran) troops from Mongolia raid Khatum's village, kill her father, and take many women away. Aga comes back to find his lovers father dying and goes after her. Khatum is to be sold and even though Aga buys her, she is taken to Halaku's palace. Halaku is the grandson of Genghes Khan. Aga goes after her, but is arrested. Halaku tries to make Khatum his second wife. She eventually agrees because Halaku would otherwise have Aga killed.What will happen to Aga and Khatum ?. Will Halaku have his way? The main strength of the movie is wonderful music by Late Shanker Jaikrishen.Watch and enjoy this very old movie.(England. GB)"
5,Very happy-,I have made six dives with this spear and am impressed with its lightweight design. JBL has surpassed my expectations and is worth the price.
2,I LOVE BBC and Shakespeare,"I hate to do this- since I love BBC and most Shakespeare productions. I really was turned off by this version. Normally BBC is so good! I always look there first. This is a very old production and is very dated. I didn't think the acting or the overall show was very good. Fortunately- I also found the Patrick Stewart version available through netflix. Now THAT was worth watching!!! I really wouldn't recommend this version unless you are looking for an old, slow and mundane version."
2,Amazing product. POOR fulfillment.,"This is such a unique musical instrument. The product itself is just wonderful. I'm having hours and hours of fun playing it. HOWEVER, whoever labels and stocks these drums in the warehouse ZERO experience with musical instruments. the SKY sticker was plastered with heavy-duty adhesive RIGHT ON THE DRUM HEAD! after a half hour of particle by particle removal of the sticker from the playing surface... the adhesive wont come off... and I can't use a solvent because it will damage the synthetic material of the drumhead. now I have gross sticky, sticker-adhesive GUNK on the surface where I have to use delicate technique and it's RUINING the resonance of the drum notes. I have to say this is a case of the warehouse staff just destroying my happiness. great drum. wish I had a new one with a clean playing surface."
4,Great Size - Lacking Lryrics,"I agree with other ""raters"" that the size of this book is great for camping, hiking, etc. It could fit into a traditionally sized pocket and you could easily find room for it in a back pack, etc. Each song also has notes, so that if you don't know the melody, you can pick it out on the piano. However, it is definately not a piano book, the notes are not arranged for that - just a simple one-handed tune. I was disappointed That most songs only have one verse and the chorus. Occasionally, a 2nd verse is included. But, I would like 4-5 verses for songs that have them."
5,The best of 80's Rush-Live!,"For me, I sometimes get in the mood for some 80's Rush; and when I do, I always wind up putting this album on. So it makes sense that at some point you have to watch it.It's a lot of fun matching up the visual with the audio.Just to see that level of musicianship and how these 3 guys come together on stage makes this worth it!"
1,What a disappointment !,"Having heard track # 5 on the radio , I quickly ran and bought this CD. A greater disappointment than the one I experienced when listening to it is not imaginable...That this music incorporates influences from from the Middle East & Africa is total nonsense.True, some tracks begin with oriental flute melodies, but what follows are generic western rythms, primitive , repetitive, boring melodies ,smelling not of either thought or creativity, to speak nothing of oriental elements. But if you are looking for truly intoxicating music with strong vocals and exotic touch, check DEAD CAN DANCE ( Spirit Chaser or Into the Labirinth), and SORMA (The Mirage of the East).Both these groups are more impressing and individual that a million Agricantuses."
4,In Perfect Voice,"Boz' voice has never sounded better, perfect I would say. Sometimes the music gets a little close to ""smooth jazz"" for me but a real nice listen."
3,A step back,"Penn retreads some of his lesser work on _March_ on MP4, and it just doesn't work. ""Whole Truth"" and ""Don't Let Me Go"" are beautiful, but ""Perfect Candidate"", ""Beautiful"", and ""Bucket Brigade"" are just sloppy and uninspired. Time to return to the pared-down brilliance of _Free-For-All_, methinks."
4,Good read - interesting setting!,I have read all of the J.P. Beaumont books by Jance. I really liked Birds of Prey. It was an interesting to have J.P. in Alaska rather then roaming the streets of Seattle. J.P. is a great character that keeps your attention. Ms. Jance has you guessing the ending right up until the end! I am eager to have more J.P. stories to read - Hurry up and write another Ms. Jance!
3,Gets Better as It Goes Along,"A retired cop, chaperoning his newly married grandmother on her honeymoon, travels to Alaska on a cruise. Sounds like a pretty old group that nothing much should happen to. However after the first sitting at dinner as the cruise gets underway, our cop hero finds himself stuck in the middle of a group of old friends who may or may not like each other that much even though they are traveling together. When one of the women turns up missing and then is reported to have gone overboard, the suspense begins to pick up. Having taken the same Alaskan cruise, I found the bood a fun read, but the characters could have been a bit more intense. This was my first Jance novel and I will try one more."
4,To Dream the Impossible Dream ...,"Jonas Piedmont Beaumont (Beau) has retired from the Seattle PD, homicide. Now he's on an Alaskan Honeymoon Cruise with his 86 year old grandmother and her blushing new 87 year old groom as a kind of Chaperone/EMT. He's hoping to have a good time and forget all the corpses in the closet of his former occupation. Such is not to pass. A group of socio-medico zealots calling themselves ""Leave It To God,"" are homicidally opposed to Doctors, researchers and patients pursing modern medical advancements and heroic measures that save lives that prior to the advancements would have been left in God's hands. Are they stalking attendees of the medical conference on board?This is not the ""Love Boat."" People are dying and Beau is back on the case. This was my first reading of J.A. Jance and I enjoyed the cruise. Alaskan fun facts, history, and travelogue are included at no extra charge. The Quixotic quest is on!"
2,woman seeking a better book on George Washington!,"I found this author to be a very cumbersome writer. He delivers a lot of great information, but often in a scattered, non grammatically correct format. This has caused me to reread sections of the book and make assessments about what the author is attempting to convey. For example, the author could be telling a story about 3 men and then continue talking only about one of them - but never tells the reader about which man he is speaking....he only refers to the man as ""him"". For a man of his credentials, I am really disappointed."
5,Different but Awesome,"I think this Anime is its own special twist, it has really cool ,combat scenes, along with the usuall anime charachters, however the special twist is the music selection during battle scenes, and the overall moral of the episodes/ movie. Its one of the best Animes Iv watched, and would reccomend."
1,DON' WASTE YOUR MONEY!,GIVE ME A BREAK. WAKE UP NFL FILMS! PLEASE RELEASE A DVD SET WITH THE STEELERS SEASON HIGHLIGHT'S FOR THEIR SUPER BOWL SEASON'S. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE JET'S BAD SEASON IN 1975. WE WANT TO WATCH THE HIGHLIGHT'S OF THE STEELERS!
5,Best Dvorak Symphonies on CD!,"The Penguin Guide classical music recording review guide book gave these recordings an unfavorable review. Shame on them! This is absolutely the BEST Dvorak symphony recordings I've ever heard (and I listened to several before finding these). Excellent recorded sound, too. You can hear every part of the orchestra very clearly. What you have here is an excellent Czech orchestra (the Czech Phil is one of the best orchestras in the world, in my opinion), guided by a Czech conductor performing music of a Czech composer. My only complaint is the 8th symphony is divided between 2 CDs, so you have to change discs between the 2nd and 3rd movements in those two symponies. But with playing, interpretation, and recording quality as good as this, it's acceptable. Highly recommended!!"
2,Not very useful,There's not much in this video by way of direct instructions and demonstration of the technique. Just a mishmash collection of excepts from his workshops. Not good enough value for money.
3,Incomplete Masterpiece,"This is a remarkable work. It has all the bearings of a lifetime's achievement, all too noticable in the unfinished nature of the book. Maenchen-Helfin died before it was finished and the book was edited together by Max Knight from the author's papers. It is encyclopedic. If you want to know anything about the Huns then consult this book, E A Thompson's ""The Huns"" formerly ""Attila and the Huns"" and P Heather's section in the Cambridge Ancient History Vol. XIII. If it's not in these books then it's not worth knowing. This book, more than the others, is indispensible but difficult to use. It is patchy and often unwieldy but breathtaking in scope and vision. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know about the Huns who also has the time to work with the book to get the information out."
4,Great Buy!,"Product is great!! You can clearly see the games in each of the cases. I thought they were soft cases when I bought them but was pleasantly surprised to see that they were hard cases.Only con is that you have to be careful when opening case because the games could fall out.Otherwise this is a great game case, slim and comfortable to carry."
5,Compelling,"I first found Grand Eagle when I was nine years old when I was in the mall with my parents. My grandfather had instilled a deep love for natural music and the store we were in (Brookstone!!)had the panel thing so you could sample the music. I bought it, listened to it that night as I read one of my books. The next day I was back and I bought every other Ed Van Fleet CD title there which adds up to five. Nine years later the CD's are still in popular use today and I find them extremely comforting because not only is the music so well done but I have many memories packed behind it. Way to go Ed Van Fleet!"
5,One of the BEST,"I take many weekend drives from Michigan to Canada (or around the shores of the Michigan ""thumb"") and leave early in the mornings when the fog still hangs low in the trees. Listening to the ""Grand Eagle's"" haunting music while driving the (almost) deserted I-69 makes this drive so very special. The ""Grand Eagle"" instrumental is totally TOPS !"
2,Agent 18 Shock Kit - Not durable,"I bought the Agent 18 Shock Kit for my Nano, primary use is running on the treadmill at the Gym 3 times a week. One day running outside.Within the first 3 weeks lost the bumpers. Grant it, the top fell off somewhere at the gym, but not as secure as you might think.Next, the velcro on the arm band began to come unglued. This didn't happen to one of the velcor's but all velcros started to peel off. I used Gorilla glue, but that didn't work. Next I stapled the velcros to the armband.One would think that I should throw it away, but I paid full price at the Apple Store for the item ($30)! So, now I've rigged it to work for another month??? I'll have to go buy the Apple armband and the plastic cover/case will be useless because it won't fit in the Apple armband.$30 down the drain..."
5,I Love It!,"This product is great! Very realistic looking. Perfect for when the power went out, I could keep it in my 2 year olds room all night. CANNOT do that with a real candle! Also makes a great burglary deterrent. Left it on all weekend. Who would go out of town and candles burning? We must be home! ;-)"
1,To Specific,"This book is part of a GREAT series and has some nice effects, however the tutorials are so specific that I found a hard time using the book for anything besides just following the tutorials step by step. I say spend you money on Photoshop 5 Type Magic instead."
5,A great adventure novel with a spiritual message,"I couldn't put this book down, and loved the way that the author transported me to Egypt! A great plot and excellent writing. I agree that this would make a wonderful movie!"
2,Lost me on page 27,"A rather basic biography. Nothing terribly new. One major problem though. Page 27 says that Nicholas didn't want to marry Alexandra, but his parents wanted him to marry her. From Nicholas' own diaries we know this to be untrue. A (somewhat) redeeming quality is that it's the only book (besides the letters of Nicholas and his mother, Marie) that I have been able to find out anything about the Greek/Turkish conflict in. I need that information for my independent study."
1,$50?,"The price is too high, for nearly the same price you can get all of the first season, which includes these episodes"
2,Uneven bevel,The jaws were ground unevenly and don't bite against the pivot. I have to move it to the tip to cut a wire.
5,Party Music,"Perfect music for a party, this CD is a compilation of Bebeto playing many of his hits live. A CD to keep you in the mood for dancing."
2,"Well, there's one problem...","I absolutely adore the Kirby anime. I'm 18 and in college, but I spend every Saturday morning watching this show. It's just so fun and cute and utterly wrong at points, though it's really hard to explain the appeal of it...The problem though, is this DVD is sorely lacking something important: the original Japanese version of the show! Yes, this is ~dub only~, unlike most anime DVDs which give you the option to see the show in it's original format with english subtitles.If it weren't for that, this would be a DVD worth buying, but unfortunately it isn't. =("
5,Easy to use. Clear read out,"This was purchased as a replacement for my 20+ year-old trusty bulb candy thermometer that broke. I make caramels at least once a month and cannot live without a candy thermometer. So as soon as I received my new thermometer I of course made a batch of caramels. The readout is very clear, the clip worked just fine on my pot. I was able to adjust the depth of the probe to get an accurate reading. When the caramel reached the correct temp, the probe and clip came off the side of the pot smoothly allowing me to pour the caramel in the pan. I would recommend this product."
5,Multifunctional and easy to use!,"This is a solid thermometer that works well in the oven and in liquids for candy making, etc. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a multi-use kitchen thermometer. Easy to use!"
2,"Good idea, bad implementation","I liked that these cables didn't have the big, unnecessary dock that the stock Apple ones have, but their quality is very poor. I ordered two for use at work and on my laptop. They arrived quickly, but neither one works reliably. 90% of the time when I use these cables, I get an error about the USB hub drawing too much current, or Windows can't recognize the USB device. If I use my original cradle, I never have a problem. And since the price to shipping rate ratio is so high, it's not even worth returning them to the seller. If the cables would have worked, this would be a great product. Other people have had success though, so I guess it's just a crap shoot whether it will work for you. Buy at your own risk."
1,does not work,"i tried it in two different ipods and nothing would ever happen, now i have to buy something else. Im prolly just going to go for the $6-$7 one i saw :/"
1,bad,gave it one star because cant put zero. got it in the mail and opened it and plugged it in and it didnt work
1,Didnt Charge,this charger did not charge my daughters shuffle..... we tried it on different computers and for more than a day and nothing. dissapointed....
1,Waste of money,"This did not charge my old iPod shuffle - which is why I bought it, so it is useless to me.Wah wah wah *charlie brown teacher voice*"
1,IPOD charger,"Hi All,Please do not purchase this item. I was fooled and purchased this item. This does not work at all. I did not read the previous reviews, so that was my mistake."
1,This item did not work,"I bought this item and when I got it and tried to use it, it did not work.I know it only cost a few dollars, but I completely expected to work and be able to chare my Ipod Shuffle."
1,Waste of money,"What a waste of a dollar, would have been better used going towards a candy bar to satisfy my chocolate craving. The charger never worked, dont waste your time purchasing this cheap product because it's not worth returning if it doesnt work."
1,Did not work,"Not only did it not work, but the USB part of it came rusty.Save your money. Stay away.Good luck."
1,Get the 3rd generation instead of this,I think this may replace the dock. It certainly doesn't work with my ipod shuffle from two years ago or the one from last year.
3,Great price...horrible delivery time!,"This was a great item at a great price, but it took FOREVER to get delivered. Usually, I just would've written it off, but I really needed it for my iPod, so I filed a complaint and within the next couple of days, I got it!"
1,philly's finest,"the product never worked, but did arrive in a timely matter. was not worried about it because it cost little to nothing . just a waste of time"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"DO NOT buy! The low price is enticing, but it didn't register at all when plugged in to my computer. Worthless."
1,Did Not Work...,"I'm glad that this product was very cheap because my Ipod shuffle would not recognize this cord to sync to my computer. I even tried using a usb wall jack charger just to see if the cord worked, and even then the Ipod did not recognize the cord."
3,Good For the Price but......,Good for the price of 5 $ including shipping. Delivery exceptionally fast. Arrived in 3 days. Only problem is that it fits a bit loose into the USB port of my new laptop. Had to press 2-3 times to make sure contact is right.Worked fine with iTunes software for Windows Vista machine. Charging and data transfer pretty fast.
1,Does not work.,"This will not even charge my shuffle. Do not waste your time, just buy the standard Apple one, it is worth your money. I am one to usually try and find alternatives to the apple product line because it is so expensive (its $20 for a replacement cord for a shuffle) but this is one thing that you might as well just buy from apple.I would not buy again."
1,DID NOT WORK!,"It did not work! So what if its so cheap, that does not mean it should not work! waste of time and money"
1,Disconnects Usb Drive,Everytime i plug this in it disconnects my external usb drive and thats where all my music is. Another person has this same problem so be warned
1,Did not work,Ordered two of these for my IPOD shuffle. Neither worked. Did not pay much but still expected them to function.
1,Doesn't work!,"I was shocked to find that such a simple product doesn't even do what it is supposed to do. It won't charge either of my iPOD shuffles, but returning it is more expensive that buying something that does work!"
1,Didn't work,"Bought as a replacement for my kids shuffle, says it would work for that generation of shuffle but didn't!!! Another waste of my money!"
1,worked for 3 weeks,"My ipod charger worked fine for about 3 weeks, then all of a sudden it stopped working and that is that. Nothing much more to say except you might be better off investing in a better quality and therefore more expensive product."
5,Morton in depth,"Morton has been considered as rather arrogant, and, before his war service, almost fascist in his very non-PC views; but that is a perspective from our current time where we have the benefit of hindsight (always 20/20 of course) and a peer of Morton's from his time suggests that there was a fairly commonly held view in the early days of fascism, before the horrors of the Holocaust that there was in general ""...an important yearning for government that actually worked - that ended unemployment, built big new roads, developed modern industries and, yes, made the trains run on time..."" With his strong ideals and religious belief, his attitude that `his' God only helped those who helped themselves and even, perhaps, his anti-feminism Morton would probably today feel at home quietly sitting, murmuring and supping at a ""Tea Party""?In Search.. Michael Bartholomew finds H.V. and reveals the deeper man."
3,sleep aid,"This product tastes very good, but unfortunately I get very sleepy after taking it, I wonder if this happens to anyone else."
1,Some useful information,"Not enough behavioral treatment information. The info in here is based on the ""mind,"" to which you cannot see. A behaviorally directed book written by a BCBA would be more informative because of the observable behaviors that you can then effectively treat. Focusing on the mind is somewhat insightful, but thing for selecting appropriate treatment. I was able to pick maybe 5 translatable pages (out of hundreds) that I could translate into behavior terms and use. Not worth the money."
3,Daniel and the Lions,Le encanto esta pelicula a mi hija...aunque carece de seriedad y es para niños...muestra un relato de como vivio en aquellos años Daniel....
5,"My heart, and my tension melted . . .","Yo quiero mucho mas de IL DIVO. WOW!I just listened to this album after having fallen in love with their original: IL DIVO. My heart, and my tensions, simply melted away as the voices soared and blended in familiar ways. Theirs is a gift to be treasured and shared, a gift to all. And I believe I can answer the question, ""Why on earth did they include 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on a Christmas album?""Listen with new ears. It's a secular metaphor for the Christmas message: hope for the hopeless, relief for the weary, redemption for those who feel completely lost -- "". . . wish upon a star . . ,"" You too may find yourself flying ""over the rainbow"" with the sheer joy of the message and mood as these four incredible singers bring new life to old classics, and usher in the season of Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men."
5,Gift for the wife.,My wife love it.Something about this group my wife really enjoys listening to them. Makes it easy on me to find gifts for her.
3,Not as Christmas-y as I'd hoped!,"I love Il Divo!!!! Having said that, I wish there were more Christmas songs on this cd. There were a couple Christmas songs mixed mostly with more general religious songs. Their sound is amazing, but my expectations were not met."
4,"Beautiful sound, poor diction","I love the sound of this album, but I was disappointed with the group's diction. Although I know several languages, I couldn't understand many of the words. Because ""Rejoice,"" which is haunting and lovely, is new to me, I can't understand the words at all.Liner notes would have solved this problem 100%. Please add lyrics!!!!"
2,mixed,"All the songs are great except I wonder why ""Over the Rainbow"" is considered a Christmas song?"
2,Not as good as promoted,"There are 2 songs well sung; the rest are not so great. I was happy to see ""over the rainbow"" on their Christmas collection but they don't sing it very well; too slow and drawn out- can hardly even recognize the song in some spots. Stick with the REAL 3 tenors collections and find Christmas music elsewhere."
3,"Good, but not stellar!","Il Divo are phenomenal. Their debut CD blew my mind away. The quality of the voices, the harmonious blend, the crescendos, the lush orchestration. Everything that makes the hair stand up on your arms. Unfortunately, I found their Christmas CD a bit lackluster. Although their voices are still top-notch, I was disappointed by the lack of grandios delivery they gave in their debut album. I found most of the renditions draggy, and the individualism of voices didn't fit the blending I have grown accustomed to and love when I think of Il Divo. I was hoping that this would be my all-time favoriteChristmas CD , but in my opinion it has missed the mark. Overall, I still love the guys and will purchase everything they produce."
4,Review,"I liked this but couldn't figure out why they put ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on their Christmas album."
3,A Commercial Christmas,"They have good voices, but the production is fairly bland and commercial. There is nothing wrong with it, but nothing really outstanding, either. If you want generic Christmas songs for background during the holiday season, this is fine. If you want something with more individual flair and listening appeal, look elsewhere."
2,No his best CD,"I love Il Divo, but Il Divo,The Christmas Collection wasn't his best CD. Maybe the selection of the song, but I didn't get the feelling or the goosespot when I hearing them singing."
1,"Not 32 Ounces, more like 24. Novelty wears off after about a day.","I really looked forward to this. I make tea several times per day. I figured, this would make it simple instead of throwing away or rebrewing my tea leaves. It does strain, and works as described, but has 2 terrible flaws.First, it's closer to 24 ounces. can fill up one 16oz mug, and a another halfway. I poured water from my measuring cups to verify that it was less ounces than stated. So, if you are getting this to fill up two large 16oz mugs, or four small 8oz mugs, don't waste your money.My second complaint is that it's difficult to clean, and there are no way to seperate the parts for thorough cleaning; not to mention the fact that this came with no instructions either! I don't see this being sturdy enough to last a year, if that."
3,ok,"They say this is better than a teabag. I'm not a tea aficionado - dunno why anyone needs to be, tea is not something anyone needs to be passionate about, IMHO, but he likes this one. 'nuff said."
5,Wonderful device!,"If you love iced tea as much as I do, you'll love the IngenuiTEA Teapot. It's a terrific device for a fresh pot of iced tea. You can stand it up and none of the liquid will leak. Then you place it on a glass filled with ice for your fresh iced tea, and the tea - brewed from loose tea leaves - expertly flows out. I love it! It's not only adorable and fun to use, but it's highly functional, easy to clean, and provides me with fresh-brewed iced tea daily. I give this device my highest recommendation. It's even BPA-free!"
3,Good teapot!,Plus:Easy to use.Easy to clean the chamber that holds the tea.Minus:Difficult to clean the area that is spring loaded. No easy way to reach that area since I couldn't find instruction to dismantle it.Dishwasher cleaning resulted in blocked mesh. So the tea exits more slowly.The tea chamber gets discolored even with cleaning after every use.Advice:Don't use it with boiling water because the tea pots leaks from the bottom. It doesn't leak while using hot water.
4,Lovely loose-leaf teapot!,"This little teapot (16 oz) is perfect for a large morning cup or two small cups of tea. I love how easy it is to clean: just rinse and dump.I've noticed that the valve on the bottom is a bit smaller than some of my wide-mouthed teacups, but if I hold the teapot at an angle and press down on only part of the cup's lip I can still initiate release without making a mess. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because the pot does not hold in heat well. After 3-4 minutes of steeping (depending on the tea), I feel my tea has cooled too much."
2,Leakage,"My received a similar teapot for Christmas and I liked it so much I bought this one.There's one big difference in the design of the two. My wife's has a screen on the bottom to filter out the leaves. This one does not.Here's the problem. I like to use it for green and oolong teas, teas that I can re-steep a couple of times. This teapot works great for these types of teas, at least the first brew. For the second or subsequent brews, a leaf can get stuck in the bottom drain hole. When it does, the tea will leak slowly out the bottom during steeping. The teapot with the screen does not have this problem because the screen blocks the leaves from blocking the drain hole.Otherwise, the drain hole does keep the leaves out of your mug. For a once off brew, like with black tea, this will work just fine."
5,Delicious!,"I've got one for tea, and one for coffee. I actually use the coffee one more - my coworkers were very curious about it at first, but now there are a few converts. Pour your coffee grounds in, pour hot water in, and give it a stir. The taste (and look) is much like a gravity-fed french press.Of course, it makes great tea too."
3,Not as advertised - short 3 ounces,"I have the 16 ounce version and have used it faithfully for some time. The 16 ounce is exactly 16 ounces. The content of the tea maker, filled to the top, matches exactly to 16 ounces from a measuring cup.I just received this and, to my disappointment, the advertised 32 ounce Ingenuitea tea pot is not 32 ounces. In actuality, it's 29 ounces. I just transferred the contents of the full ""32 ounce"" Ingenuitea to a quart canning jar and the tea is more than 3 inches from the top. While it makes the tea in exactly the same way as its baby brother I can't make full quarts, which was expected."
5,Must have gadget,"A must have if you drink a lot of tea or coffee.It's easy to use and to clean.You just add hot water to your tea bag or loose tea, and Voila...I have had mine for 6 months now and it is still in good condition."
2,Better to just get induvidual teabags.,"I bought mine direct from Adagio. If you drink tea daily, after a month it'll stain even if you wash it after every use like I did. I settled on just getting individual tea bags, which work out soo much easier and more convenient."
3,Does what it's supposed to do. But is not what it says it is,"I have used this tea pot four times since receiving it three days ago. Each time it's produced great tea very easily. I have not used loose leaf tea yet, I only have tea bags right now.The reason I gave this tea pot three stars is because it says it's a 32 fluid ounces tea pot when it most certainly is not. I measured it with a Pyrex measuring glass and the most I could pour into this tea pot was about 30 fluid ounces or so. Any more and it would spill over the top. I really dislike false advertising and this tea pot does not make 32 oz. of tea. It's impossible."
2,overrated,"The filter broke in the dishwasher the first time I tried to wash it. Before that, it was not so very easy to empty the used leaves. I'm not sure why everybody is so impressed with it. Really, it's pretty messy, and then washing it leads to breaking."
4,Ingenuitea TeaPot,"This item looks stylish and works well. The only Complaint is that while using smaller loose teas (such as Rooibos), very few tea leaves come through the sprout. This doesn't cause much concern, but can be annoying to some."
5,Good quality. But be safe.,I love this teapot. Best ever. And Good quality. But be safe. Hot water may pour out from the bottom.
3,"OK, no more ...","It's a decent teapot, I guess, and it has a lot of novelty appeal. You certainly haven't used one like this before. Aside from the cleverness of the design, though, I'm not crazy about it. I find it no easier or faster than my traditional-style Bodrum teapot to clean up. I don't know why they advertise this as being capable of brewing 32 ounces of tea. When I fill it to the brim, I get only three medium-sized cups of tea out of it -- I'm guessing it holds something more like 24 ounces of liquid. And I'm not certain how I feel about pouring boiling water into a plastic teapot. It's one *very* plasticky little device.I'm not sending it back, but I don't know how long I'll be making regular use of it either."
5,LOVE THIS!!!,"After reading reviews about the filter being loose, I was hesitant to order this, but I'm so glad I went ahead and gave it a try --- It's THE BEST little tea infuser I have used so far! I ordered a glass infuser and it broke on the second use so I am grateful I had this in the box awaiting usage.Put in a slight rounded teaspoon of lose tea leaves (I Love Rishi and The Tao of Tea brands) into the 16 oz contain and pour in heated water and steep. Set the Ingenuitea on the mug and it starts pouring into your mug from an opening in the center bottom of the cup. Lift the cup and it stops, you can even press on the underside with your finger and it will pour that way, also. Not one little speck of tea leaves gets into your cup. It comes with a round, plastic coaster (of the same material as the pot) to set your teapot on.Will buy this for Christmas gifts for all my tea drinking friends. Would purchase again!"
2,Not very practical,"Because it doesn't come with full instructions and I couldn't find these online, the first time I used it I didn't realize that I had to take it apart for cleaning so small leaves were stuck in between the bottom part.Of course I realized I had to take it apart, but then every time I need to try a couple of times to figure out which way the small rubber part goes by filling it with water and seeing if it drips.Every time you wash it you need to keep track of the two small rubber pieces and make sure you don't lose them.Unfortunately now I lost one of them so my ingenuitea is useless. And I don't see any other replacement parts for it other than the filter.One more disadvantage is that it smells of tea even after washing. Cleaning with vinegar etc that other people suggest makes this even more cumbersome to use."
3,Another kind of teapot!!,"The Adagio teapot is practical, especially if you use a lot of loose tea and are not keen on buying a traditional type of teapot.I would have preferred a glass teapot, but when ordering, I hadn't realized it was made of plastic. As other reviewers have mentioned, I too am not very comfortable with storing hot liquid in plastic containers.The teapot does leak a little, but only if it is not placed properly on a surface. The serving of the tea, although easy, is a trifle unusual- you place the teapot on top of the cup and the tea pours into the cup...The loose tea leaves are not very easy to get out of the teapot when cleaning it.In the two years I've had it, I haven't had any problems with it and it is a conversation piece when I use it for guests. The price is reasonable. However, I am still looking for a traditional ceramic teapot, with a good filter...'"
5,Fantastic.,"I'm a huge tea fan, and have a lot of different varieties from all over the world--I spend extended time overseas, most recently in Sri Lanka, which is of course known for its tea. With this gadget, it's easy to make and enjoy the different ones I've collected. Can't speak to it's durability since have only had it a short while, but for ease of use, and clean up, it's a great item."
3,Good book on Branding,"For me this was not a good cover to cover read. Each chapter was written by a different author. Some were great and others not so much. One of the chapters I felt like I was reading Shakespeare... It's great to use esoteric words and be verbose and all...If it makes sense and helps you convey a message. I just didn't think that it was necessary to use such obscure words in that chapter.Regardless, If your looking to learn more about branding this book will help."
4,Missing a story,"This book is a great compilation of articles on different matters related to branding. I missed a story, a guiding line between each chapter: so make sure the articles interest you individually before you buy the book.All chapters that mattered to me (like 30% of them) were really great and full of practical examples."
3,"Great story, let down by poor QA.","I've been reading this series since 1998, and love it. Having it available in eBook format is a fantastic plus; I'm on limited space, and need to cut back on the physical volumes.Unfortunately, this Kindle edition - unlike the physically printed ""dead tree"" edition - is marred by myriad typos and formatting errors. Some of them are minor (using the wrong apostrophe for abbreviations; hyphenation marks where they don't belong); some are more significant (spelling mistakes, probably from OCR errors that weren't caught on a proof-read; poor text flow - missing paragraph breaks and similar.)The book itself - indeed, the entire series - is a fantastic read, and well worth the asking price. Sadly, the eBook edition needs more polish before it can be called a properly finished product. The same applies to the other three books in the Westlands cycle of the overall series (I haven't yet bought the other 11 books for my Kindle.)"
1,Did not taste good,"The portion was small, did not fill the bowl, and did not taste very good. Not worth the money in my opinion."
5,Probably the best Rock DVD ever.,"This DVD covers the original VHS movie, digitally remastered for DVD. Besides this, the DVD is packed with lots of extra's.It contains about 9 in ring promo's and 8 backstage promo's. These promo's are very funny to see, it includes promo's of TheRock making fun of the Big Show's chokeslam, Kane's 'voice box', The Undertaker's tattoo's, how Triple H is 'the game', The Rock and Sock connection and much more.If you like the The Rock as a face in the late 1999, then you should really be getting this dvd."
4,Was not at all what I expected,"It was a little different, but after the first couple of chapters, it was truly interesting. This author does his homework!"
4,I'VE LEARNED SOME THINGS,I gave this book to my husband who loves golf and is not religious. He said he learned some things about life that he could apply to his golf game and when he did that.... he played better and felt better mentally. He mentioned several times it was not what he expected but better.... and he loved it!
4,Blessed is the Golfer who gains Grace,"Play golf with God! With a plot like that, I read it quickly to see what happens. My review title gives you a good idea as to what happens but see for yourself. It is a short story worth reading, if the time spent reading does not take you away from actually playing golf. In Seattle the rain is now setting all time records.Merullo's story could help you with the emotional/ mental of your game. I doubt it will do anything for your swing.I subtract one star, because I was looking for for more fascinating detail about golf to be worked into the plot. But I can see another reader holding back a star, because they were looking for more about God."
2,Not a book for kindle,I am new to juicing and I needed a more elementary guide.I had originally chosen this book because I wanted to know what was beneficial for particular diseases.I also wanted good recipesOn the kindle it was difficult for me to maneuver this book. A hard copy would have been much easier because I wanted to jump from page to page.Feel like I wasted my $$
4,Good reading,This book is packed with the BEST information on juicing. Easy to read; many recipes for any issue a person may have. This author really knows her stuff!
5,Maybe the best jazz of 2000,"Incredible jazz, free and strangely coherent at the same time. Deserves to be better known in the US. Check out his work with Francois Houle and with his unit.""Phonetics"" is another incredible release of this brilliant and inventive pianist. Highly recommended!"
5,Spellbinding,"I cannot think of an adjective to convey my feelings about this. I cannot call it enjoyable because the subject matter is far from that. It is, however, one of the best 1-man shows that I have ever seen. Antony Sher's performance was riveting. Without emotion he stands as a witness to the horrors that he, and others, endured. His descriptions of events are objective and detailed. The staging, use of a basically bare stage and very effective lighting, was exceptional! I saw it on Public TV and went on-line to order it the same night. Excellent production!"
3,Too general,"I realize that this is standard reading for the USMC, but it is billed as a tome for the civilian as well. I found it a bit too general for tactics, both for personal protection, as well as for law enforcement. OK as a general overview of battlefield/global warfare, but not easily adapted to other uses."
5,Hinderburg would have flown this one,Schnell shipment! Just like A Panzer 3 in the low lands in '40....Very good quality...enough to piss off the communist in your neighborhood.
5,How Pagan is Christianity? Read this book and find out!,An excellent treatise on the pagan origins of many of our Christian festivals. Fascinating reading.
5,Wonderful!!!!,"The CD is wonderful! Teisan has a beautiful voice, and the words in his music comes from his heart. You not only hear the music, but you listen to the music and you feel the words. You are the best!"
1,Not very Witchy,"I ordered this cd from Amazon thinking that it spoke the language of Witchcraft and Magick. It was actually little more than some lush arrangements with an 80's pop feel. The lyrics sometimes suggest magickal truths but are never straight forward with it, as though they are somehow riding the fence between Witch and non-Witch audiences. Some songs even suggest strong Catholic themes as another reviewer mentioned. Perhaps the band is yet unable to release themselves from the chains of their past. I hope to see something a little more Witchcraft themed in the next release from this potentially talented band. Otherwise, perhaps they should change the name of their band from Coven to Congregation."
3,Contains other soundtracks,Music is good but doesn't contain all music from the movie and also contains music from other movies. Perhaps reflective of that era. Disappointing when expecting entire music portfolio.
2,Dead Poets Society,The music is great but also very 'dated' and the sound quality reflects a recording from that era.
2,Terry lined shower cap,I found this cap to be to small and the material it was made with to be very stiff.I gave it away .
3,shower cap,this product is good-its a little smallerthan I had anticipated. It arrived quicklyand it is a good value
1,"Only one cap in ""Pack of 3"" !!","""(Pack of 3)"" Has only one shower cap in package. My wife wanted to keep it, and get the other two as advertized, and as described in several reviews, but Amazon's return processing allows only a return with refund. Also, price now is $7.99 vs. $9.61 I paid three days ago!"
2,disappointment!,"I was very disappointed with this product. The terry lining is really unnecessary, it is bulky and the band around the cap does not fit snuggly, therefore it does not keep the water aut very wee. The colors are pretty, but a plain clear plastic cap works much better. The plastis on the outside is not pliable, thus it doesn't fold well. I threw mine away."
5,MST3K: The Final Sacrifice,"As an avid fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I would say The Final Sacrifice is one of the best episodes I have seen. Mike and the bots do a great job of riffing the movie, and there are alot of great lines that come from it. Definitely one I would recommend!"
2,Review from a Fender guitar and bass owner -,"The design of this stand is nice as a concept; however, the padded arms the guitar rests on are somewhat weak.The arms exhibited some minor flex with a standard electric guitar and major bending when I attempted to rest my electric bass on the stand.I also found the over all foot-print to be 2x that of my ""Fret-Rest"" stand, this is due to the angle of the guitar once placed on the stand(nearly 45 degree angle).I originally purchased this to display one of my bass guitars but this little stand was begging for mercy!Also the shape of the guitar body caused the guitar to slowly slide to the left or right since it does not have a neck/fret rest to keep the guitar upright.Hope this helps you avoid being frustrated with your guitar stand purchase.Cheers!"
5,Works just fine,I got this for my 10yr old daughters Mini Strat (Squire) guitar. It's good quality and fits the small (3/4) body of the guitar just fine. it also folds up pretty small. We are very happy with it.
1,Very disappointing,"Unauthorized for a reason. No original music. Cheap production. Weak interviews by unqualified non-experts (one interviewee was listed as a ""biographer""). Waste of my time and money."
3,"interesting, but much is left out","Brinton's anthology of the revolutions of '89 is good, in that is contains much about the actual events of that magical year from throughout east and central Europe, with sources from a variety of perspectives and social strata. However, it has very little from the voices that proceeded the mass exodus of nations from the Soviet bloc - and for this reason I can only give it 3 stars.To be fair, to go too far back would be out of the scope of the book. However, I am surprised at the lack of materials written by such well known dissidents as Vaclav Havel in the early 1980's, or even materials from the Solidarity strike in Poland. More recent events such as Hungary's graudal ""warming"" to the west (as ""many roads to socialism"" were advocated) would have also been appropriate. Nonetheless, it is a comprehensive look at a watershed year in history."
2,Didn't last long,"Died after 1.5 years of use. Contacted EVGA, was told it's not under the warranty anymore(didn't meet some cutoff date for lifetime warranty).When it worked, it's great. It started making loud noise 2 month ago, first I thought it was my power supply. My ATI radeon 9800 pro bought 5 years ago is still running quiet and strong.Not happy with evga's quality."
1,Coach Julie,"I bought this tape looking to get some help and ideas for running my daughter soccer practices. This tape was no help! It is aimed at four to six year old kids only, and will not give you any coaching help."
4,Mykey from Toronto,"O.k., When I ordered this cd, I thought to myself ""please god, not another ball washer"". If you're freestyle fan, you definetly know where I'm comin' from. Normally, I don't dig female freestyle vocalists because they got too much of a bubble gum, hairspray flava. But there's two on this cd that got me stroked. The 1st is ""Heart and Soul"" by LAISON and 2nd is ""How I love him"" by CYNTHIA. Both are very well produced with nice hooks, beats, vocals etc.Hope this help, Mykey"
1,terrible and cheap,"I have never tried henna before but by all accounts this is definitely not real henna. As a reviewer said above, it did not stain anything at all, the instructions on the box are poor which implies to me that these people are not real henna sellers (says mix with cold water-- no measurements at all-- whereas other, better henna products tell you to use a specific measure of warm tea water). I used the tea water anyway left this on for two hours and when I was done spent twenty minutes washing all the DIRT and rocks and sediment that was left in my hair. this stuff sucks and the Colora company should be embarrassed to sell such a mockery of a product. My hair was not in ANY better condition than when I started..."
2,2 good matches on da show still makes ss good right,austin vs mick vs hhha very good 3 way match austin opened a case of whippin while foley bumped and hhh played da game da guest referee jesse da body da his duty 2 make show no 1 cheated or interferened n da match this match was ****starshane vs testthis was surprisingly a very good midcard hardcore match if not mistaken 1 of test best matches 2 date and not a bad 1 4 shane either shane debuted his legendary elbow drop from 1 place 2 another and some other wicked moves were seen in this highly reccommended match this match was ***1/2-***3/4 not bad at all
1,SUMMERSUCK!,"Why does everyone here think this stupid PPV is great, come on! what a boring hardcore match between Al Snow and Bossman, the only best part of the match was the camera racing to the guys, King said it reminded to him as the Blair Witch Project! the other matches are dull as well like Shamrock and Blackman in a weapons lion den's match? the crowd was soooo quite, they didn't know who won! Ivory and Tori was stupid, the Street Fight with Shane and Test was probably one of the matches that saved this pathetic show! The main event really suck so bad, why would they let Mankind the title in the first place! come on! give it to Triple-H! Jesse was really entertaining, he made the match amusing inspite of the boring match, the ppv really sucked, don't even look at!"
4,Tune Belt review,I've used the product before purchasing it and like it very much. It is unique in that microphones fit perfectly in the pouch and the stretchy elastic belt makes for a nice snug fit for use during exercise.
4,Visual Aid for a teacher of Shakespeare,This action figure was purchased for my adult daughter who is an English teacher.Her students study Hamlet by Shakespeare and she requested this miniature doll to use in class. The high school students were intrigued and liked it - anything to heighten enthusiasm for the subject!
5,girl got blues!!,"let me just say debbie can rip up the strat.a must have for any blues fan.the instrumental ""percolatin"" did it for me. enjoy trevor,"
2,Fingernails on chalkboard vocals?,"Are you people deaf ? Debbie Davies has a sing song monotonic vocal delivery. Her guitar playing is adequate at best , and the disc is only salvaged by the numerous guest stars. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Thanks , but no thanks."
4,Nice Processor,By the time I bought this one the best US$/processing now I think the best may be the E6600. I'm satisfied with him. But if you have the bucks go for the E6600.
3,Different,"Take a gay son, an alcoholic father, an emotionally retarded mother, an emotionally disturbed daughter, a grandmother suffering from Alzheimers, a blind dog, winking Christian statues, and what does that add up to? One wierd movie!This film defeats any attempt at categorization (which, according to the liner notes, was the writer's intent). It can best be described as comedy-horror. The family is so dysfunctional that at many points we honestly don't know whether to laugh or cringe.I'll give the film this much -- it's different. But unless you delight in seeing other people's mental and physical diseases I'd recommend renting it before buying."
2,Not true to book!,"If I hadn't recently read the book the movie might seem great. After reading the book I was very disappointed in the movie. Neither Mr. Thornton or Margaret are so haughty as portrayed in the movie but they are quietly strong willed in their own ways. It's the subtlety that causes you to like them both and ache for Mr. Thornton as he keeps trying to win Margaret's favor. Also, Mr. Thornton, his mother, and sister all have differing accents in the movie. Weird. Read the book! It's one of Elizabeth Gaskell's best works."
5,Couln't have been better,"A must see!! We all Love this one! Delightful, really intriguing story, terrific acting. Great characters, costumes and scenery. Wonderful romance. Watching it over and over is a privilege. Even dealt comfortably with uncomfortable socio-political issues."
1,Wretched,"I was expecting this to be a sappy chick flick. It was better in some ways, and much worse in others.What it lacked in vapid emotionalistic romance, it made up in a heroine who is horribly self-centered, feministic and manipulative, a story in which the heroine doesn't take responsibility for her questionable actions, has a very egocentric morality and behaves reprehensibly, lying to police investigators, luring a mutinous brother to town which causes the death of a man, insulting her apostate father's successor at his vicarage, stringing along an obviously still-smitten former suitor while it suits her needs.Add to this the BBC's relentless socialist touches to the film, sloppy modern additions like the ridiculous kissing scene in the train station, and cardboard characters on par with the later Star Wars movies, and you have a real mess.There's much, much more to dislike. Don't waste your time.Just wretched."
5,North and South,Loved it! If you like Pride and Prejudice you will love this movie. It is one of my absolute favorites.
4,well worth watching,"Though the movie started slow, in my opinion, the character development was very well done, and the ending was so moving that it was well worth watching the entire 4 hours. It's the type of movie I like to watch again and again."
5,Simply Loved It,"I made a New Year's Resolution to watch at least one BBC program a month on my Kindle Fire streamed through Amazon Prime in 2012. I was thrilled to today watch the presentation of Elizabeth Gaskell's NORTH AND SOUTH. Beautifully filmed, perfectly cast and with wonderful timeless themes it was a joy to watch from beginning to end. I had previously enjoyed the BBC adaptation of Gaskell's WIVES AND DAUGHTERS but loved NORTH AND SOUTH even more. Highly recommended to all lover of British Victorian literature. I intend to read the book this year as well. And the streaming through Amazon was perfect both on the Kindle where I watched the first two episodes and on my PC where I viewed the others."
3,A bit disappointed,"I was disappointed that I didn't see more of the romance aspect of this story. I didn't read the book, but from all the reviews, I was expecting more romance. I liked it well enough, but any prospective buyers should note that if you want to buy this because of the romance, you're better off getting something else perhaps. This was a decent movie overall."
3,so-so,"This movie had rave reviews so I decided to get it. The leading man spent waaaay too much time frowing. I wonder if when they went to cast the part they asked a bunch of guys to line up, and whoever could glare for the longest amount of time they hired. I think that the fellow only smiled in the last 30 seconds of the movie.I would say that the film it self was far too dramatic and that the drama was caused by people not being honest. Those people then spent the rest of the movie avoiding each other only resolving spontaneously in the last 2 minutes."
5,Loved this!,"I don't really watch a lot of televison, DVD's included, and my taste usually runs to sitcoms and silly comedies, not 4-hour gritty costume dramas. However, I kept hearing such good things about this adaptation so I bought it, and now having watched N&S, I can honestly say it's really one of the best films I've ever watched. I sat down and watched N&S all in one sitting and I continue to watch it over and over again, especially the ending. The ending is one of the most romantic I've ever seen (and the music is just lovely). It's beautifully filmed with great production values and acting. In particular, the actor portraying Mr. Thornton, Richard Armitage, does a wonderful job. I didn't think much of him beforehand but now he's totally crushworthy. Highly recommended."
2,Disc 2 cracked,"Good movie but disc 2 has a crack and wont play. Unfortunately, I waited too long to watch (or open it) to return it. Lesson learned. Love the story so far though. I'd definitely recommend buying, but open it as soon as you get it and check out the discs."
5,Great value for a great movie!,Bought this for my mom's birthday and she absolutely loved it! The story is fantastic and I love the ending.
4,North and South,My daughter loves this movie. I like it as well. I thought the price was alittle high but once I watched the movie I felt it was worth it.
5,A True Masterpiece of British History,"I just discovered this 2004 BBC television adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel. The actors are superb and the story is told truthfully, but eloquently! Highly recommend this DVD set. Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby Ashe have the best chemistry and you will not be disappointed."
2,Please - find the monster and kill the agony,"Get ready for lots of product plugs for Mr Spillane's favorite brand of beer, and ease back into your chair for hours of sheer boredom. Too many characters and no compelling story are the deathknells of this dreadful book. I liked Mako's tough guy image, and I liked his Caribbean sidekick, who keeps calling him ""sar"", but I didn't like the rambling nature of the book. Now, onto a book I can enjoy..."
4,He's Not Lost His Touch,"Mickey Spillane may be getting on up in years, but he hasn't lost his touch in wrting good ""potboilers"". This one, revolving around retired US espert at ""removing"" people, Mako Hooker (who, I admit, reminds me of a retired Matt Helm), involves two plotlines, one involving ""something"" which is severely damaging or sinking boats in a section of the Carribean, and a second one involving the mob, high finance, and greed, with old acquaintances of Hooker's around on all sides. I won't spoil the ending, but it wraps up nicely and with some technical touches I've not seen Spillane use before (not complaining, though, 'twas nicely done). As usual, the hero gets the gal at the end of the book and, like most Spillane heroines, she's samrt and gutsy herself."
4,Nice clean stereo transfers.,"I have several other ""greatest Hits"" Gerry and the Pacemakers CD's and this is by far the best collection. These are not re-recordings or rechanneled mono tracks. The digital transfers are the cleanest brightest that I have heard. It's about time Gerry and the pacemakers got a decent ""Best of"" release."
1,Pedometer,"Product was big dissapointment. I walk about the same path every day and the gadget read different every time, Sometimes it didn't even register. Stopped using it after a week."
3,Redskins rule!,"A video tribute to The Wahington Redskins' greatest triumphs; JOhn Riggins on 4th down in Superbowl XVII, Doug Williams' amazing 2nd quarter in Superbowl XXII and Mark Rypien's season to remember culminating in Superbowl XXVII. Then there's the disappointments; Miami in Superbowl VII and can anyone say Marcus Allen? Plenty of memorable moments and players to look back on and to show younger fans what it was like when The Redskins ruled the game. A little bit dissapointed in the bonus features and the fact that there isn't more footage from the regular seasons and play-offs when we went to the Superbowl. Fun to watch nonetheless but NFL films can do better."
3,the work,I am the artist my review of this album is music is growth and as time go by one can only excel if music is your thing.
2,"Some Great Moments, But Lame Ending","I'm a longtime 24 fan...I was watching when it wasn't hip.Although there are some terrific episodes in this season, the last handful and the subsequent ""resolution"" are as lame and formulaic as TV can getThe acting is sill first rate, but the final plot ""twist"" is as easy to predict as the outcome of a Detroit Lions away game. Way too much air time for President Logan and his bi-polar First Lady. I'm disappointed enough to scratch 24 off my ""must watch"" list."
3,A neo-femme finally gives in and enjoys it for what it is,"I have just decided to quit my (justified) yapping and enjoy the show for what it is: a so-so political thriller minus the thrills, hampered by a real-time gimmick that has worn out it's welcome.My other reviews of the previous seasons tell it like it really is on a deeper level, but like my friend said: ""This show isn't worth applying your high IQ to.""This season starts off on the right foot and them slowly loses momentum until it completely loses most of it's credibility. Proceed with great caution."
5,24 - Season Five,Thank you for the opportunity to continue my library of my favorite show. Best price found anywhere.
5,Perfect,"I have been a 24 fan from the beginning. And for me to be addicted to it for 5 years straight now really tells how awesome the show is. 24 just gets better each season and everytime I think the preceding season can't be topped, I get proved wrong. This season went above and beyond anything I could have imagined and is the best one yet!"
5,Highly Addictive,"24 is the most intense and entertaining TV show that I have seen. Season Five is the best one yet.Assassination, Murder, Mayhem, Setups, Hijacking, Treason, and Treachery are all in this season of 24. Most of them make an appearance in the first two hours and it just gets better from there.This show has more twists and turns in one episode than most programs do in a whole season. The acting and casting is also excellent.For those who have never seen 24, it is a tough call. The show is very addictive. One might be better off to not ever start with it. On the other hand, it is highly entertaining. If you have not seen it before, I would recommend starting off at the beginning of season one and going from there. It would really help with the background for this season. If one does not want to consume that much time on it, I think that this season would probably do pretty well as a stand alone also."
5,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK UNTIL YOU MEET BAUER!!!,Best show on TV!!! Most thrilling season yet!!! Not only for men! I'm a very girly woman and I love the action and suspense of this show!
5,Awesome Season,"Of course I already watched Season 5 when it first aired, but I watched the entire season again in preparation for Season 6. Season 5 was awesome and Kiefer Sutherland was amazing (as usual)!"
2,Disappointed,I thought this book would be interesting as it was set in Yorkshire. But it was just a vehicle for a sexual romp between two consenting adults. There were also some inconsistencies in the book. The parties converge on the stately home for a wedding celebration but the parties to the wedding are nowhere in evidence! The bride is said to be the only daughter of the Earl of Hareton but this seems to be an error as he does not have a daughter!
3,"It was ok, but not great","Rose Golightly is a country girl is really who knows that there little chance of getting married. But a visit to Hareton Abbey, she meet Richard Kerre, Lord Strang. After a attemped on Lord Strang's life Rose realizes that she has meant the man that she wants to spend the rest of her life with. But Richard is to marry another and breaking agreement may cost him everything.""Yorkshire"" is the second book that I have read by Lynne Connolly and I didn't like as much as the first on. I really couldn't connect with characters and I didn't really like that fact that it was in the first person. I have gotten ""Devonshire"", the second book in the series with hope that it is better than ""Yorkshire"""
5,"Wow, what a great mix of unknown music!","This is SO cool! I bought it for my husband but it ends up that I'm the one that listens to it the most. The songs are actually written to fit pieces of Neil Gaiman's fiction, not just drawn from different sources because they kinda fit. And such a wide variety! But the one thing I can say for sure is that the whole CD invariably has the spirit that imbues Gaiman's books."
4,End Times Fiction...Or Is It?,"End of the HarvestThis video, if nothing else, gives the viewer lots to think about and consider. Whatever your thoughts on end-time prophecy this video presents theory that I had never heard and I found it valuable if only for that reason. The storyline is good but I didn't come away with a feeling of ""WOW!"" - rather with a feeling of ""Hmmm...interesting. VERY interesting!"""
2,This Movie is for Babes in Scripture.,"If you are well versed in scripture and possess Wisdom and Knowledge, you will not be pleased with this movie. The knowledge offered in this movie is watered down with doubts. There is no hard hitting truth, and the outcome is unrealistic. Look else where for truth to build on. This is not a resource for the watch of Him who comes like a thief in the night. I would say that this movie deserves 2 stars."
1,The rapture is NOT biblical!,"over the years this movie has ignorantly used over and over as a tool of evil. there, i said it.and YES, i absolutely am a christian.fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman->most importantly, THE RAPTURE IS NOT BIBLICAL !!!!!!this is a weird fear based agenda that has no place in the kingdom."
5,Yes! More please...,"I have only recently seen old Jack Benny shows, from another Mill Creek collection. These are genuinely funny, by today's standards. The guest stars are nice bonuses. If you're a fan of the the few 50's shows still aired (Lucy, Honeymooners), then you'll really enjoy Benny's show. Fun, absurd twists every few minutes. Since the price makes it almost free, buy this. However, you'll probably want a larger collection once you've poured through this one. Sound and picture quality are acceptable throughout."
5,Best of Jack Benny,"Jack Benny was one show that made my Mother really laugh.,in thoes days their wasnt much to laugh about in Ireland!.Jack Benny is for me ""Stash"" the FUNNIEST man I have ever seen on TV.His genious has never been surpased,and he makes me laugh even more now and I am in my fifty""s.Highly recomended. Great memories1."
4,I have a question,"I wanted to know if anyone out there has had problems with their DVD's of this product. I actually bought one from Wal-Mart, and over half of the tracks on each of the four DVD's do not work. I was especially disappointed because I am a huge Burns and Allen fan, and I wanted to see George Burns interacting with his best friend, Jack Benny. To my disappointment, that was among the tracks that would not play, as well as George Burns famous vaudeville act, ""Goldie, Fields, and Glide , which he often performed with friends like Jack Benny. This also would not play. However, it was awesome to see Fred Allen and Eddie Cantor in the first track.I do not wish to buy another copy of this DVD if I am going to run into the same problems. If others could leave their comments to this question, whether or not it would be worth it to buy a new copy from Amazon, I would appreciate it. Thank you."
1,Crap.,I loved the Jack Benny Show but this DVD was of such poor quality is was all but unwatchable. Do not spend your money on this product.
4,One of the best funnymen,There are some great episodes of the Jack Benny Show that will entertain and make you laugh even if you did not experience the shows originally.
5,The Jack Benny Show!!!,"The Jack Benny Show will definately entertain and surprise anyone who isn't yet familiar with the show or the comedian. My kids don't watch much TV (or anything black and white) but will sit and watch this when I have it on. They just don't make programming like this any more & my children have commented that the show is funny without being rude, insulting or vulgar - unlike shows/programming of today. Jack's mannerisms and actions alone make us laugh out loud. I highly recommend this collection, you will watch it again and again."
3,A Welcome Return,"What can you be disappointed in when one of the best bands ever comes back together again. This is like John Lennon and George Harrison coming back from the dead and Paul McCartney and Ringo joining them after many years. Happy Days, and they still can put out the gems!This album does not have as many gems as the previous one - 1988's 16 Lover's Lane or the one after it - 2002's Bright Yellow Bright Orange, but it is still good to hear!"
1,B is for botany and bad,"In the early 90's, I had the opportunity to teach a beginning botany class to home gardeners. The class had been taught for several years and Capon's book had been choosen for the text. I read the book and was surprised by the flagrant inaccuracy on topics such as plant anatomy and photosynthesis. The chapters were poorly arranged and overly technical. Since people as whole tend to remember what they were first taught as law, it disturbed me that many gardeners may be misguided."
2,doesn't work right,hard to set up. after a couple of weeks the wind speed quite and has to be reset. don't know how long it will last. rest of unit seems to work ok.
1,Clumsy,"The Honeywell TE923WHoneywell TE923W Deluxe Weather Station with Rain Gauge, Barometer, Thermometer, Wind Datais a clumsy collection of weather sensors. All sensors are separate and need to be mounted independently. This may be the proper arrangement for some installations however for my needs an integrated sensor pack is more practical. Also it is reported that the wireless range is severely limited....but i have no experience with the units operation for I never opened the package , but returned it the same day it arrived. I recommend a Davis Vantage Vue weather station. The Davis product is in the same cost range as the Honeywell, has an integrated sensor package and is operating wireless well over 200 feet, and through walls in my application. Documentation claims 1000 feet for line of sight."
5,"Fantastic! - Easy to set up, a joy to use!","Bought this for my wife for her birthday. Super-easy to set up. She relies on it heavily on a day-to-day basis. It is fun for the kids to, as they get to wath the wind speed, rain fall, barometer reading, etc."
4,Very entertaining for our baby!,"It's a video that is very entertaining for our 3 months old, he gets relaxed when he watch it. We wish the DVD could be longer than 30 minutes, in general is a great product, highly recommend it."
5,Excellent Stuff - much more soothing than Baby Einstein,"My kids love this stuff, even the 3 and 6 year olds, but most importantly, the 10 month old.The music choices are beautiful selections from symphony and opera with real instrument productions, unlike Baby Einstein which is mostly chimes or synthesizer music and baby toys.We play the DVDs all the time. Anyone looking for something like Baby Einstein but with real symphonic and/or opera music will be very happy with this purchase. The music is incredibly soothing, and even the cartoon visuals are fun and relaxing to watch.We love each of the 3 DVDs. My only complaint is that there aren't enough of these - why just 3? I do like that Baby Einstein had about 10 or so DVDs covering different learning things. Maybe this series will increase."
5,Perfect entertainment,My 2 1/2 granddaughter loves the music and the animals. So charming. I have the Art one also. This is a lovely way for us to relax and unwind. Buy it. This is relaxing and enjoyable entertainment.
5,I never leave reviews but have to for this,"I have a 10 month old baby so am rather short on time, but I definitely want to leave my 5 star review for this DVD. We don't do TV for the little one but some diversion is helpful at times. This DVD is amazing. I bought a few others (Sesame Street, some Asian music DVDs) but this is by far the best. The creators chose beautiful, tasteful music (adults & baby can all enjoy); graphics are SO adorable, and my baby boy is enthralled. I love it so much that I purchased the Art, Dance, & Poetry DVDs. It's probably all we'll watch. Highly recommend."
5,wonderful!!!,"My son LOVES this show!!! Music and animation are so so wonderful, this DVD is one of our favorite!I highly recomend it to parents!"
4,Recycled,"Made in EU in 2002, Serial# SI-905176, Playing Time 59:09This compilation features tracks taken from only 2 albums: ""Cycles"" (represented here by 6 tracks), while the other 8 tracks are from ""Brotherhood"".While those 2 albums were ""unavailable"" for a period of time, they have been re-released with bonus tracks (2 on ""Cycles"", 3 on ""Brotherhood"".)Perhaps if this compilation had interesting packaging, some liner notes, I would be able to recommend it as a wise purchase... but all you get here is basically an hour of music taken from 2 albums... 14 tracks out of the original 20.Sure, it's cheaper than buying both albums, but I think each of them is worth purchasing in its own right..."
3,I would have expected more from the authors,Unlike the five star book 'Java how to program' this book seemed to having been written under time pressure and is not as thorough as I would have expected. The best part is on JavaScript but the chapter on XML for example didn't help me at all.
2,Does not deliver what it promises at all!,"Unfortunately, this book does not deliver what it promises at all. By reading and ""trying"" to study the exercises in this book, you just learn a few tricks about ""some"" programs, however; you will not advance in any of those programs. The exercises are dull if not terribly thought out. None of the javascripts does not work. The photo shop exercises are terribly designed. All in all, if you are inexperienced and stupid enough like me, buy and waste your money with this book. Next time, I see any of the Deitels, I will use the book for something good and knock him off with it!... In short, horrible piece of crap. The worst $68 you can ever spend!..."
2,Boring and bland.,"This book is great--if you are a beginner. It has no solid relevant information to take into the business world. I own their c++ how to program, and thought this book would be great too, but I was wrong. If you want useful and excellent information for internet programming turn to wrox publishing, they have some excellent books out there. This one bites."
4,"The Wildest Dream,: The Biography of George Mallory","This book helps flesh out more about the real George Mallory, helps one understand his quest and obsession to succed in climbing Everest. To know more about the man that George was, read this book."
4,If you love Dizzle...this is your DVD,This was a great DVD. The only thing i didn't like about the DVD was that it wasen't the whole season...it's just a few of the best episodes. Lots of Thomas and Dizzle on the Disc.
3,Allegorical and Historical,"The first story (St. Mawr) is apparently an allegory about the U.S. the UK, and Europe. A fact I wouldn't have picked up on if not for the introduction by Richard Adlington. It's probably chock full of symbolism too, but I've never been too keen on that either. On its face it's about an unhappy marriage, a horse, and the relationship between a mother and her daughter. The second story stands much better on its own. It's about inter-generational family dynamics and conflict, and young womens emotions, and the powers of lust and rebellion and conformity. I'm sure some people will be angry that I'm giving D.H. Lawrence only 3 stars, but this is no Lady Chatterly's Lover."
2,not as described,"I was very disappointed in this Lily.The color was pink as described, but that's where it ends.It was not a double and had no defining petals.It looked like a regular lily with six petals,and had no dots.Maybe they gave me the wrong lily,don't know."
5,It's terrible - BUT my child LOVES it!!!,"The worst sound quality you've ever heard - the most primitive animations ever created... BUT my one year old stares at the screen and smiles and laughs and points and WILL NOT MOVE FROM HIS SEAT until it is over. We bought this as a set with two cassette tapes, a songbook and a video when he was 4 months old and he has been captivated ever since. He will not watch anything else on TV but when this comes on he will stop whatever he is doing and watch for the full half-hour. I'm not sure if he is learning anything, but the video has been a lifesaver if he is crying (it stops immediately) or if we have to put him down for a minute (he won't budge.) There must be subliminal messages in it! I highly recommend it for YOUR sanity, if nothing else! I'll keep you posted to see if he actually has learned any Spanish!"
5,I was so surprised how my baby loves this video:,"When I saw the video for the first time, I thought ""This is so boring"" My son is very alert & into details so I thought he will not like it, but he stares at it without paying attention to anything else.It is my baby's favorite since he is 5 months old & he is 11 months now & I still have to put it on every day. I guess is the music together with the drawings, colors & spanish language etc..."
3,Ok But Others Are Better,"We are trying to expose or baby some Spanish everyday. With that goal in mind we have several Spanish board books, CDs and DVDs. This DVD did not hold my babies attention as well as the Brainy Baby Spanish and was not as enjoyable for me as The Babies First Words CD in Spanish."
4,For entertainment more than education,"The sound quality of the video is not good enough to understand all the words, (a big drawback for a foreign language video), and ours also came with no book to help with this problem. The images are 2 dimensional graphics, but are bright and fun. The music is actually quite catchy, light and rhythmic. Most importantly though, my 2 year old triplets love it!!! They dance to it and enjoy the cute images."
4,"beautiful, but too sad and intense for some","there is no doubt, this is a beautiful, heartbreaking story, but please read it before you give it to anyone, child or adult...despite what the author said in her interview, it is NOT a ""happy"" story, it IS too intense and sad for some children (and their parents sometimes, too...) but if you read it with them, and are prepared to talk about it (and cry) with your kids, I think it is right up there with the best of all children's stories, which sometimes deal with death"
4,inspiring and motivating movie,"Let me start with the reason for the missing star- there's alot of cursing in this movie. It makes sense coming out of the mouths it comes out of, but it does limit the audience for this incredible documentary. Earthships are cool, but if you have a twelve year old in your life that is interested in environmentalism, art, architecture and whatnot, this movie may just have a few too many f-bombs to show it to them.Other than that, this is one heck of a great documentary!You can't watch this movie without becoming immediately obsessed with Earthships. My wife and weren't even half way through this film when we had to start pausing it to discuss ways we might one day incorporate some of the ideas presented in this film into our own property.The struggle against the local planning board will appeal to your inner libertarian."
1,No Good,"I am a master plumber with over ten years in the trade . I recently finished a job for a plumber and was forced to purchase this tool. At first I loved it One month after this 2 - 3 million dollar home was completed a stainless steal clamp snapped, resulting in about 4k in damages.Its been almost 1 year its happened 3 more times and now Watts has admitted to me they have problems just like this when you have hot water over 120 degrees. Which in Massachusetts is the minimum temperature for hot water. I will never use this product again, I hope for the safety of everybody this product will be banned."
2,"One star for the beats, one star for Hell Rell = 2 stars","A dude at my work gave me this album to listen too. He told me it's ill so I checked it out.Pros:The beats on this album is pure fire.Hell Rell in prison spits fire on the phone.Cons:Hell Rell is not on every track.Lyrically, the whole diplomat crew outside of prison is wack.Two CDs of wasted beats.They should of made one CD and put Hell Rell on every track. Save your money and buy the Hell Rell album whenever that comes out."
3,not bad,"The diplomats album wasn't too bad in my opinion. Just about all of the songs were samples of songs from the 60's. In most of the songs it seemed like all of them were just freestylin'. Most of the titles to the tracks don't have anything to do with what there rappin' about. The production was pretty good on most of the tracks. The tightest songs are: ""dipset anthem"", ""real n****s"", ""who am i"", ""i really mean it,"" ""purple haze,"" and ""i'm ready"",So if you like songs that have been speed up and are samples of songs from the 60's this is your type of album.(don't think cause i'm from arkansas I don't know nothin about eastcoast music)"
4,DiPsEt HoLlA,this is a good two disc ablum from camron jim jones and julez this is way better than the bluprint 2 they bot should of been one disc anyway cause the gift is the [***] and the curse is off the hook but i listen to camron ever since horse and carrige and see no change in him and his crew a thats y this ablum is good to get another roc member to look for is twista i heard he signed but havent heard anythin bout an ablum........ GO OUT AND COP THIS [***] AND SUPPORT ROC A FELLA!!
5,great album,"some people hate the diplomats and say they suck, but i think this is a great CD. its 2 discs, so u get alot of songs for cheap. i reccomend that u buy it."
4,Most Underrated Rap Group,"The Diplomats have to be one the most underated rap groups out there. Backed up by Cam'ron (who everyone seems to hate) Juelz Santana, Jim Jones and Freeky Zeeky. These 4 make up the core of the Diplomats with Cam'ron's comedic rhymes, Juelz's santana gunshot straight flow, and jum jones hard, clever rhymes the Diplomats have what they need to be a great rap group. But since all the G-unit lovers hate these guys the get such a bad name. Do yourself a favour be open-minded listen to the hard gritty street rhymes and buy this album."
4,diplomat_758,"Diploamtic Immunity is deffinately one of the better albums for the year. Camron should be proud of of his dipset family who blazed fire on tracks like "" real Niggas "", "" I really mean it "", ""Dipset Anthem"", ""What's really good"" , "" Who am I "","" My Love"",and ""Let's go"". Camron did it again with his gansta verses and rymes that seem to blow like a flute, he keeps you guessing ""what's he going to say next."" Santana is what we call in the Caribbean a "" Topa top"" He has the skills to be the next star for Rocafella. FreakyZeaky and Jim Jones have to be congratulated for their work done on the album. I can't wait for the next Diplomatic Album."
1,I couldn't take it anymore,"I listened to it once and it was enough. As for the one star rating, it's for Dipset Anthem, which is hot, despite the Juelz's weak flow (and when I mean weak, I mean it's as though he was coming up with rhymes while in the recording booth). But everything else...wack as I don't know what. I couldn't figure out what they were trying to do with this album. And two discs? Come on now!"
5,Casi Una Mujer,"Yo Imigre a New York en 1980, ahora vivo en la Florida,si yo tubiera la habilidad de escribir un libro seria 99% la misma historia que ella nos relata. Por eso me senti tan identificada con este libro, Me encantaria saber si alguien que se mudo a New York en el 2000 se ve reflejada tanto como me senti Yo. Este libro me trajo tantas memorias, lo disfrute en cantidad. Gracias a Esperanza Santiago"
3,Leopard in the Snow,"This was listed among one of my favorite books as a teenager and as soon as I saw the DVD available, I was curious to have it to compare to the book. Great story"
4,Works for me,"Works for me, because my camera has no PC socket; however, I did not consider that it does not regulate voltage for older, higher voltage strobes"
4,Great product!,"It adds a PC sync socket to cameras that only have a hot shoe and makes it possible to use a much larger selection of flash units with a variety of cameras, not just Nikon.While it does not do TTL, most flash units can use their automatic sensors to meter output.Used it extensively with a Nikon Coolpix 5000 and newer Vivitar 285 and 283 flash units. Also tested it with a Canon Rebel.Please note:Make sure you test your flash's trigger voltage if using something not recommended for your camera, digital or not.If you have a camera that uses iTTL, like the Nikon D70s, you pretty much have to get one of the iTTL flash units."
2,Nikon AS-15 Sync adapter,This adapter is only for other low voltage Nikon flashes and won't allow you to use other higher voltage flashes such as Vivitar or any of the common smaller studio lights. For that buy an adapter from Wein.
2,Nikon AS15 not compatable with some cameras,"Did not work with the two cameras I have, I did not know hotshoes were different. Probably works fine with Nikons"
4,Decent story,"Overall this book was good. However there were parts where I wondered who edited it, only because sentance flow was not that good. Odds are I would have skipped over the sentance problems if I had really been pulled into the story. Although I had trouble putting the book down after I started, the characters weren't real enough for the story to just suck me into it.Like I said before, overall this is a good book, and it is worth the read."
1,66 Chapters & Not a Single Page of Sensuality,"I was highly disappointed by 66 Chapters on 33 Women. The characters were dense and rather saddening. None had a sexual past that I would ever want to aspire to or even fantasize about.When a woman reads erotica she would prefer not to read about men discussing their sexual histories using derogatory terms for the women they've bedded. All these pages could do is make sex with a man the last thing on our minds. Also, many chapters had scenes that did more to nauseate than to titillate.I found myself forced to read this just so I could provide a proper review. Thankfully it was short read. I would recommend looking elsewhere for TRUE erotica."
1,lol,This reads like a vanity-press book written by a talentless megalomaniac. Esztherhas doesn't have one even halfway decent movie to his credit: his films are lamebrain fare. The editors at Knopf have really lost their heads.
3,WHO CARES ANYWAY?,"It's dificult to really care whether Joe Eszterhas wrote good scripts that nobody made or made well (Joe it seems is never to blame for anything). The man lacks any sense of moral focus which makes the book particularly hard to read. And the stories he tells about Robert Evens and Sharon Stone are not new though probably true--I met Michael Ovits once or twice and though he was nice enough to me I'm sure he could have been an S-O-B if he had to be. It's all relative.In any case, the idea that somehow any of this will matter in ten years is nuts. The movies were terrrible and Eszterhas comes off as soul-less. The only truth here is that nobody in Hollywood knows what the hell they are doing."
3,"No Recent Hits, Moved to Cleveland & Got Cancer","It was very humorous. I don't think much is very true as far as his feelings go.The part about saving his Nazi father from deportation by hiring a Jewish lawyer is very suspect. He, of couse, feels the reason his Nazi dad wasn't deported is because he made such great films celebrating human rights.In reality people who drink 3 bottles of wine per day along with the glasses of gin and bourbon and joints (as he admits)don't have feelings, they have hangovers. According to him, it never bothered wife nbr 2 and she thought he was great in every way. He states he was still able to come six times per day when he was around 50.You can tell he really wants this biography made into a movie.He's now a non-drinking non-smoking Christian living in the Midwest."
1,Piece of crap.,The footrest broke immediately when I tried adjusting the height. Don't buy it. Is that long enough for a review?
5,unforgettable and moving,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I was unable to put it down and finished it in two sittings. It was simultaneously fascinating and appalling if that is comprehendable.The horrific and degrading treatment of Seren and her fellow prisoners is beyond anything any of us can imagine and their ability to survive against all odds is truly heroic. Man's inhumanity to man is portrayed in all it's shocking detail. I found myself moved to tears several times, but could not stop myself from finishing the book as quickly as I could. It is definitely worth reading. You will never forget it."
4,Third volume in DRG'S series spotlighting film themes,"This particular compilation presents an extraordinarily bulging bounty of riches, and it strikingly emphasizes the composer's great skill and seemigly infinite range. The dozen of films represented are each of a different cinematic genre. So this 1 CD compilation offer a very nice way to discover this remarkable composer."
4,"rare, but good parenting advice","While I did not necessarily love Mrs. Boyack's writing style (just a personal preference), the advice in this book was good and definitely not common in the world of parenting suggestions. She presents a well thought-out approach to parenting and gives common sense suggestions for how to make a plan to accomplish your parenting goals. My beliefs and goals may not be the same as hers, but the basic advice is great and the plans are easy to modify to your family's goals. I think the main thing that you will get out of this is the idea to make a plan. You ARE teaching your children something about life and their responsibilities all the time - if you aren't consciously working towards a goal and you're not getting the results you want, you need to step back, assess the situation and make changes based on your long-term goals for your kids, not what will get you through the next few weeks or months with the fewest conflicts or challenges."
3,LBJ,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer says. He could be electric and he could be downright terrible. As a record of LBJ's life it is very useful.However, the best speeches of LBJ were when he did not have a prepared text. Then, and only then , do we see the full free flowing brilliance of LBJ. But sadly in this tape they all set texts. Moreover, it would have ben rather cute to have had speeches he gave before 1964. For example, speeches from 1948 are available. So even if there were no film we could have had a montage of stills. His 1948 speeches in the Texas Primary against Stevenson are electric. Perhaps this could be on a follow up video?"
4,Very Interesting,"A good collection of unconventional sex and sexual history. Learned a lot of new things, but you have to read it with an open mind."
4,wake up!,"i like a few of the other people that reviewed this cd, slept on it as well. once i gave it a proper listen, it was over from there. i like every single track and her voice is amazing."
2,Not very good to me,I only liked 2 songs on the entire album- I really liked her voice and bought the album bc of some of the great reviews but i disagree soooo...i think epiphany is a much better buy!
4,Talented Chick!,"Chrisette's CD is like getting 5 or 6 in one. She handles the jazzy/blues vibe, slight folk influence, the straight R&B, and the hip-hoppish raw soul flavors beautifully. She has such range and various tones to her voice where it sounds like someone else is singing on each track! A couple are a bit to sappy for me, but overall it's a solid start. Very nice freshman CD, and I'll be on the lookout for her next release!"
5,"Good voice, Good album",All I can say about this one is that it's a MUST have. Her voice is so beautiful...it's an instrument of amazement and she wields and commands it well to craft out something truly moving and lovely.Top 5 Favorites:1. Best of Me2. Mr. Radio3. Love Is You4. Is This The Way Love Feels5. Your Joy
3,Great voice,"I hope Christette Michele's record label carefully chooses the songs for her next CD. While it is great that she co-wrote all the songs on this one, it might be best that she hand over songwriting duties to others. As she doesn't have the look or the sound to be a commercial diva such as Rihanna or Beyonce, she runs the risk of being a sub-par sales artist in her future efforts. And that would be a shame. Her voice is beautiful, and it is clear that she can sing classics such as ""Your Joy"". But apart from the latter and ""Best of Me"",the songs on this CD are not great and it sounds to me that vocally she can master anything she is given to sing. I hope for more..."
4,Great Show,"I didn't like it at first but then I actually started watching right before the season with Seinfeld Reunion and HBO was showing the season before that on demand in the summer so I kind of got hooked by the time the new season (Reunion) started. Now I""ve shown it to some friends who aren't fortunate enough to afford HBO and they are hooked. They want to come over every few weeks to watch more. I'm basically watching like it's a new show.I'm not a left winger but I still enjoy the comedy. I can sometimes look beyond those things if it's written well enough. I don't think Larry David thought this show would do so well when he first started out but it being on the air still shows that it can't be all bad... Just my opinon."
2,Remember Fawlty Towers,"The 4th season of Larry David is a very sad capitualation to pressure of the previous brilliant seasons. Sometime funny but more often disappointing. The invention and imagination we hold dear may be inevitably declining.Especially since collectors as myself, who have supported the previous seasons will be very shy of any future purchase.We should remember the influence of John Cleese creator of Fawlty Towers, maybe the finest TV comedy to date,who simply realised his legacy after two seasons.With the passion comes the prejudice, so fans as myself should well accept and so encourage Larry to his next project..My best wishes to his continued success. And with a heavy heart I will only regret this purchase."
5,Nikki Cleary / Nikki Cleary,"Very up beat, terrific songs, I'll be looking forward to listening to this Cd over and over. Highly recommended."
3,okay...,"Her songs are great and all, but whats the deal? Is she trying to impress a guy with her music. okay Chris Trousdale in that song, was cool, but the music, wat up with the beat? its totally lame. other than that is was okay."
2,ummm,"I do not think she has fabulous voice! Shes ok, but not good. I think the only reason she has made it this far is b.c her family may have money, but i think she sould go for something else. I kno others that have a much better voice. But, Keep trying gurl!! ur kewl!"
2,"MAYBE interesting to you, but...","... not sure how much of the book actually is of substance. We used it in a research project to document Canon's success over Xerox, and I did not get anything out of it as I had hope for. The information also appears quite outdated.Instead, if you're interested in Canon, search some business article databases at your local library, or online.Not recommended."
5,Christian Flag,This flag is excellent quality so much better than any I've seen and the price can not be beat any where.
1,relata...,"el ajusticiamiento de unos piratas, bandidos que incluso en su pais natal, tenian, la mayoria, cuentas pendientes con la ley, bendito Dios que se les aplico estrictamente la ley."
1,Descriptioin is misleading,Read the description that if fit my Honeywell air purifier model and ordered it but apparently there are several sizes for the same model and seller would not accept return of open item. Will not order from them again.
4,Excellent for listening comprehension,"I started this course a few months before going to France for vacation. I had already been learning French off and on for a few years, but never got very far except in reading comprehension. I was not sure how to get better at listening and speaking. After completing the first 60 lessons before my trip, I was much better able to not only ask questions in French while in France, but for the first time understand what was said in return. It was an amazing thing to go into a cheese shop and have a two way conversation about which cheese selections I should take back home with me. Of course I am by no means fluent, and certainly not after only completing half the course, but for the first time in a long time I feel like I am making headway with the language and I suspect it will be even better after completing the whole course (active and passive waves)."
2,"Compelling story, but poorly written","The first 30 years of Molly's life are a fascinating story, but this writer was not the one to tell it. The awkward and amateurish quality of the writing detracts from an inherently interesting tale. The prose is particularly cringe-worthy when the writer attempts to summarize history or wax lyrical about complete strangers' guessed-at emotional states. The book needed a good copy editor, too - it has far too many errors.Molly deserved a biographer (and perhaps an editor to work with the writer) who could shape a well written account of her life."
3,It was ok,"The book started out a little slow but definitely got better towards the end. I agree with another reviewer who compared the story line to Gossip girl. I felt like some of the descriptions of clothing were a bit excessive and sometimes unnecessary. I would have much rather had the characters and locations be described in depth so that I could feel drawn into the story. With a really good book, the descriptions can pull me into the book in such a way that I can actually create a scene and the characters in my head like a movie. I didn't get this with this book. I still liked it and intend to continue with the next book."
3,Meh,"I didn't know what to expect of this since there has been an abundance of crappy vampire books.I noticed that it is pretty much Gossip Girl except with vampires. Which isn't that bad if you're into that but it's also not that good. It's just okay. It's an easy read but if you want some substance, this is probably not the best book for you.This first book really leaves you hanging. It's obviously part of a series but I wish that the author could have at least tried to put in a little closure for us who don't want to continue reading the series but don't want to be jipped either.Also one thing that bothered me was that some of the Latin phrases were grammatically incorrect.So in short if you like gossip girl and vampires this is the book for you, and if not, I wouldn't suggest buying it, borrow it from the library if you are still curious."
3,this is an ok book,"I think this book is just ""ok"". It has a good story line. I don't think the author explains the characters very well, but I do have to say that it does make me want to read the other books in the series!"
1,Bad Fanfiction,"I feel that the general plot and idea of this book could have been something great. Unfortunately, it is written so poorly. There is more description of clothing than any actual good description of the characters and what they are going through or feeling. It's so jumbled and such an afterthought. It really felt like bad fanfiction to me. Good idea, bad writing. Pretty unlikeable characters."
4,Continue to read the series,It was a little difficult for me to get into this book. It was a little slow and I really think that book 1 and 2 should be one book. The only reason I decided to read book two was because the origins of this breed of vampires truly is unique and I wanted to see if after the much needed introduction to this series the story would get exciting and it most definitely did. I am up to date with all the books and they continue to shock and excite and stay current.Every other book in the series I gave 5 stars too except this one. It could have been more exciting. 4 stars were given for the imagination and creativity Melissa de la Cruz has to offer.
3,BLUE BLOODS,ok where have i heard this story? oh ya city of bones! both start of in a club. they see some thing no on else had seen. she coppyed cassandra clare
1,NOT as described.,"Book was described as ""like new"".Book arrived missing the jacket, hardcover is stained in different colors.Far from being ""like new"" as described.NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
3,3.5 Stars. Intriquing.,"I thought I wouldn't be able to read pass the first dozens of pages because of all the fashion brand names she was dropping. Seriously, we know she writes for fashion magazines, but keep that separate. It was giving me headache. Anyway, I read this book, because I want to try this series. I'm not surprised it wasn't that great, but I expect the next ones to be better. I like that it's based on Croatan. I like that Schuyler (which I absolutely have no idea how to pronounce) dresses so unique. I like that eventually she stands up for herself. I cringe a little at the twin's pass lives. I wonder if her future is with Jack (who I don't like much right now) or could it be Oliver? I do expect great thing from her, this daughter of Gabrielle."
1,A complete waste of time.,"The author chose to focus more on fashion than on the plot and its characters, thus leaving the story half-baked. I thought I was picking up a book about vampires, not Vogue or Elle! The author went overboard with her obsession for designer labels that it just got beyond ridiculous. The characters weren't well developed, as was the plot. The flow was very choppy. It was painful reading the book but I forced myself to finish it hoping that the author would redeem herself somewhere down the line. Alas, it was not to be. This was a complete waste of time, paper, and ink."
3,What's with all the fashion?,"Ack! So I get this is supposed to be high society, but the author is constantly detailing what everyone is wearing, I find myself skipping over descriptions of designer clothes and shoes.. It gets annoying!! On top of that, it's not a very good plot. I'm only about 80 pages in, but having a difficult time getting through it."
5,Delightful read,The book was excellent!!# I could hardly put it down and ready to read the next book in the series
1,Didnt deliver,I seem to have developed a liking for this genre over the last few years. However Blue Bloods left me flat. I didnt finish the book as it just failed to grab me.
2,by Maria,"While I loved the snug fit, alas it did not last long. I was so very careful, how I put it on, but it still ripped in the first few month. I like the feel of it better on my head, but it has to last longer than one month or two."
1,Who are these little people.,"I ware a size 7 5/8 hat size and have short hair. The reviews for this cap indicate that people with big hair are using it. I was hoping this cap would work for my needs. Forget it. There was not a chance that that I could put this on my head without getting a head ache. I could not come even close to covering my ears. If you have a big head, look somewhere else."
1,Splits easily-too expensive for 3 wears,"I loved that the cap fit my big old Rosie O'Donnell head (as my husband so lovingly refers to it) along with my hair - no headaches, no pinching, it was great. Until the third time I wore it - split right up the back. For this kind of money, I would expect a better made product. Really disappointed. And for the record, I do know how to put on a swim cap, I don't have talons, and I think I am thru with aquasphere products of any variety."
4,"Good fit, good quality","The cap fits snugly and does a good job of covering the ears as well as all of hair. Takes a little getting used to to put it on, but that would be for any new swimming cap.Great value and good coverage."
4,Grisman and Friends Kick It Up a Notch!,"Some musicians, like fine chefs, make it look so easy. David Grisman is one of them. On the CD, ""I'm Beginning to See the Light,"" the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by Scottish guitar virtuoso Martin Taylor and veteran Grisman Quintet members Jim Kerwin and George Marsh (on bass and drums/percussion, respectively) for one hot little album. While the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards, such as ""Autumn Leaves,"" ""Makin' Whoopee,"" ""Lover Man,"" and ""Cheek to Cheek,"" the Taylor/Grisman Quartet seems to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible seasonings to the pot to make Emeril shout, ""Bam!"" As Don Stierberg, who penned the liner notes, says: ""Music need not be trendy to be great."" I wholeheartedly agree. (C.A. Carlino)"
3,3 out of 4 isnt bad,"Martin Taylor completely dominates this album. As a jazz guitar player myself I was in awe of his playing on this project which can be summed up by one word, tasteful! Every note he plays is perfectly ""in the pocket"" but yet still incredibly tasteful at the same time. The rhythm section is also amazing. They complement Martin Taylor's playing with true musical maturity. My only dislike concerning this album is David Grisman. There is nothing tasteful or mature about his playing. On several songs Taylor will play a solo that brings tears to your eyes only to have Grisman ruin the moment by coming out of the gates in his solo with some blazingly fast distasteful licks that seem to be striving to showcase his technical ability. All in all i could have done without David Grisman on this album."
2,Just OK,This book was odd in a out there scifi kind of way. Just not my kind of content. Maybe others will like this book but I'm not one of them.
2,Mysteryplanetary,"Although Mr. Daniel is an imaginative Sci-Fi writer and seems knowledgeable about the hard science aspects of his story, there are things that make this book unsatisfactory. The most disturbing of these is that it isn't pointed out anywhere to the buyer that this is actually an unfinished book. Several important subplots are introduced and then abandoned by the end of the narrative. It's as frustrating as a detective mystery in which you are not told ""who done it."" Also, the writer haphazardly jumps around among many different characters and you find yourself having to continually flip back through the book to refresh your memory about who this person was."
1,Immunity is not granted,This music is just awful. It plays like a bad new age album.i thought this would be good cause I like the theme song but I really dropped the ball on this one
2,Dirty Blond,This story line was tough to swallow. Even the most air-headed among us wouldn't do what this babe did to herself and supposedly she had a law degree and thus I assume is not supposed to be considered an air-head.Quality of writing was alright but it is not a book I would recommend.
1,Awful,Don't waste your money buying this book. The plot (??) is ludicrous -hate to give the so called story away it's so unreal. Did Ms. Scottoline write this book??
5,Still a worthy heroine,"Scottoline definitely has a flawed heroine in Cate Fante--but that's okay. I like her. She's not perfect by any means, but none of us is. I found this book follows Scottoline's usual, fast-paced plotting. Excellent read. Looking forward to more on Cate.If you like this book, check out a new author I've recently discovered. I highly recommend Thirst by Dania Deschamps."
4,"More psychological, less consumerist than before","Lisa Scottoline is by now a well known commodity. Her women have heretofore been bright, attractive and starkly consumerist. Good people but obsessed with the things that are the tokens of success. This novel marks a move in a more human and humane direction. Her judge finds herself in a situation requiring a ruling according to law not justicewhich becomes tangled with the judges private life. Friends and associates also become involved (pay close attention to cell phones)and attitudes clash and shift. While deep motivations -childhood, friendship, family- make sense, there are alsosome unrealistic bits. The conclusion is somewhat scurried after the lingering development, but this is a real improvement over arlier works. One little thing, I really could do without the expression :aargh"" regularly appearing throughout."
3,Doesn't hold bag well,"Overall the cart is ok for moving your tools around, but it is difficult to attach a garbage bag to the cart. We are constantly having to re-adjust it. Clothes pins help a little to keep it in place."
3,Almost....,"This little cart almost makes the grade but not quite. I suppose it depends on what kind of gardner you are...if you are a lightweight and go out to do garden work every now and then this cart will be perfect. But if you go out a few times per week and like to have all your tools with you, including your bug sprays, fertilizer, etc. then I would opt for the heavy duty cart. This one is just a little too flimsy for gardening warriors."
2,An upsell with lots of bog bottles,The bottles are WAY too big to be convenient travel bottles. Most are actually useless. The bottle you want is the smallest pill bottle.
3,an odd assortment,"Nothing wrong with the product, except that I could find uses for only three of the bottles. You're better off buying individual small bottles once you know the right size and shape."
3,3 stars for the song selectrion but not the mixing.,"CD 1 appears to have very promising songs. Also, this CD-1 is not mixed. This DJ just threw these tracks together and played them one right after the other. CD-2 however, is mixed well by DJ Wayne G. It wasn't Wayne's usual high-energy euro-dance mix. What this 2nd CD was full of was songs that were faster, trancy mixes. Don't get me wrong. I liked this CD-2. But, it's definitely very dark trance that I wouldn't listen to at a party. This CD set was ok because I didn't pay much for it. If the song selection interests you, buy it but don't pay more than $6.00 'cause CD-1 is not mixed unless that's what you're looking for."
1,"Died on Day 1, First Use!","I've been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.Reminds me of the saying: ""Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day"""
1,HORRIBLE,"This sheet set is unbelievably rough and after an initial 3 washes to soften it up, I gave up. Used them only once when i ran out of sheets. Feels like some sort of cheap waterproof kitchen table cloth instead of something you'd actually sleep on. Horrible.."
1,Not what your looking for,"While the music on this DVD is ok(Dieselboy, Goldie, etc), the actual video part is lame. Most of the videos on this disc are the type you would see on MTV with real people and places. If you are interested in something more closely related to that of a party or rave, look elsewhere. If anyone knows of discs that are computer generated with a techno background please email me."
2,Boring,"Wow - how could this DVD be boring? I jumped at the chance to own the first ""trance"" video DVD. At $13.96, I mean, what a deal - right? No, not really. This DVD has two main drawbacks: The musical selection is geared much more to industrial music than to trance, house, or electronica. So the music is darker and more repetitive. That is my main complaint. If you're into the industrial sound, you'll probably be pleased with this selection. My other complaint is that the music does not always appear to be well-synched with the video. Many videos left me wondering if the band had anything to do with the visuals, or if some outside company just threw together some visuals at their own discretion. And the visuals are not really all that good. I expected some really fascinating visual treats, but mostly what you get are cloaked people walking through the rain and through the forest, etc. Not my cup of tea."
2,Women in Law Needs an Update,Cynthia Epstein's Women in Law although informative was very dry and out of date. It was written like a college text book or a research reference with many charts and tables. I don't mind the charts and tables but the information in the charts and tables was only updated through 1980 and most of the information was centered around the 1960's and 1970's. If you are looking for an easy read that describes current life and experiences as a female attorney I suggest you keep looking. If you are looking for information to back up a research paper on the topic focused on the time frame of 1980 and prior use this book.
3,Knockout!!!,This movie is for female boxing fans. It is the rise and fall of a latina Female boxer. The story is about an attractive latina starting in to the boxing business after her best friend who is a boxer whos name is Sandra (Gina La Piana) is suffering from a severe knockout. Belle is caught to find her way to boxing glory and has her heart broken when both mother and father have both past away. If you want to watch a Femle Rocky watch this
2,"Good topic, bad movie",I was very disappointed by this movie. I had seen the great movie about female boxing called SHADOW BOXERS and I wanted more. This was not even in the same league.
2,didn't like,incomplete is how i would describe it. i was expecting it to have more information about the games and the actual super bowl games.
1,Read some Scholarly reviews.,"For those who have been so impressed with this book, you really need to dig a little deeper. This is by far the most unscholarly and shoddy work that Gerstner ever produced. It is full of distortions, inaccurate quotations, and mistaken factual data. If one is going to read this, they need to also read the reviews of John A. Witmer at the Dallas Seminary, Bilio Theca Sacra web site, and/or the Richard L. Mayhue review at the Master's Seminary Website, TMSJ 3:1 (Spring 1992)."
1,What can I say? This is a very bad book!,"I am amazed by anyone who attempts to redeem this very poor book. Vindictive, inaccurate and yes, un-scholarly! Read the reviews by Richard Mayhew in the Master's Journal and David Turner in Grace Journal (both reviews of the original edition). Honestly, there are other MUCH better and fairler reviews of dispensationalism (Poythress' for instance). You don't have to agree with dispensationalism but PLEASE let us disagree without this sort of ""purple prose."" Kistler should have started from scratch rather than attempt to ""fix"" this really bad book!"
2,Mighty beanz go bye-bye,"I collect mighty beanz [...] and keep them for myself.These just aren't fun. They just flop. Because there is a small little ball in there.I wouldn't give them to 4-6 year olds because some of them have blood and bad pictures.They copied banz off other series and claimed them ""different."" (They just have different names.)One day, cousin came over and we played with some. We droped one and it slighty touched the floor and it broke.Please do not waste your money. And that's when mighty beanz go bye-bye."
1,SUCK!,"These suck! I collected over 180 beans, and wasted 180 dollars! I could of bought an I shuffel or an I pod mini! These suck, I'm going to sell them on EBAY!"
1,Ha ha! An Israeli neo-conman writes about the 'American Spirit',"I only bought this book becaue it only cost $2.00, and I knew it would be a joke anyway. I tried to keep an open mind while reading it, but found it little more than a re-hash of Toqueville's book albeit with a neo-con spin.Ledeen by the way is widely suspected of orchestrating the 'Iraqi yellow-cake' rumor on behalf of his puppetmasters in the Israeli lobby.Not a good choice of authors for this 'unextraordinary rendition' of a timeless classic..."
3,"This was an okay book. Bought it for my husband, then I read it too.","The book was pretty good towards the end. I probably woudn't read it again, though."
5,BLOW YOU OUT OF YOUR SEAT !,"UNIT WAS EASY TO SET UP! BUT BRING A MAGNIYFING GLASS TO READ THEM! I WENT TO PIONEER WEB SITE AND DOWNLOADEDTHE MANUEL SO I COULD READ IT EASIER. WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY,SO WE CAN PLAY THE UNIT AS LOUD AS WE WANT.EXCELLENT!! WE COULD'NT BE HAPPIER!!"
4,Does the trick,"This clip seemed to do the trick while practicing my kayak rolls, but I still prefer the spring loaded style with wide, round pads. Also wish there was more room to attach a cord to it, i've fed the three I bought to the lake trolls."
3,Entertaining book!,"I liked this book. There was a lot of action between protagonists and antagonists and it followed a somewhat logical plot line. There were enough twists and turns to keep your attention because if you weren't paying attention, you could have lost the whole thread of the book. I liked the twists and turns a lot. Even when surprised, the story line followed through and connected all the twists and turns."
4,Relative STrangers,"I enjoyed the read. The characters were somewhat interesting. Lead male character's job was questionable. There should have been better closure with the twin's life at the end. What about the baby and the love interest, and the relationship to the lead male as the uncle."
3,The Second Summer Of the isterhood-not as great as the first,"I have to say, I was extremely excited for the second book in this series to come out. I enjoyed the first book very much. I felt that Carmen's summer was boring and there were no inportant events. She is upset about her mom's behavior and acts so childsih, i couldnt stand to read it. The beginning of Lena's summer is a bit slow but as it goes on, it gets better, i enjoyed her section as i reasched the middle of the book. Tibby's adventures at film camp are fun to read but can also come to be a bit slow. She grows as a person and her part is pretty good. I really enjoyed bridget's summer. She actually did something that was out of the ordinary-she took a big risk. i looked forward to her sections. her summer turned out very interesting. overall, i think the second summer of the sisterhood is worth it to read, but dont get your hopes up."
4,Spazzer's Comments,"Ann Brashares writes a well-written sequel to the Sisterhood of Traveling Pants, although it is certainly not the best of the best.This book is not a very humorous novel, but it deals with issues that are more serious. Plus, the Lena and Kostos thing is more maturish and it doesn't turn out what you expect it to be. *hint hint: it's not very obvious*This book would mainly appeal to the young adult audience, for it has some things that would raise ""questions"" if it was read to 7-9 year olds. Especially the Lena and Kostos parts."
5,THESE PANTS DO iT AGAiN!,"Last summer the magical jeans that belonged to Bridget Vreeland, Carmen Lowell, Lena summthin and Tibby Tomko-sumthin did their magic by being the love pants. Lena met Kostos, Tibby met Bailey(not love love, friend love), Carmen met, well, someone, and Bridget met that coach in soccer camp. It's been so long I can't even remember. But all I know is, this book is wonderful. It will make you want to read on and on and not put the book down. What happens when Lena goes back to America and Kostos stays in Greece? What happens after Bee and that hott coach seperate? What does Tibby decide to do after Bailey the next summer? And what ever happens to Carmabell?? You'll really love the books, whatever age (mostly like gurls from 11-16). But who cares, I insist!!! This book is seriously the best EVER!"
5,better than the first!,"This along with The Sisterhood of the Traveling pants are my two favorite books. I think it was even better than the first something i thought would be impossible. Yet again the four friends find themselves seperated for the summer and find a way to keep in touch-the traveling pants. But I warn you, its another tear jerker and extremely hard to put down. It has lots of romance, tragedy, and humor and of course friendship. I think that any woman that reads this book will not be disapointed. I loved it so much it was like looseing a friend when it was over. I hope Ann Brashares makes a third book because she truly does write amazing books!"
5,GREAT!,It totally threw me for a loop! I loved it! Keep up the good work Ann. And please make a 4th Book.
5,One of two great books,"I don't know if I like the first one or this the best, but they both are very fun to read. I mean, you laugh, you cry, and I really don't think nudity is a problem, the book was made for young adults and 11 years should probably read books more pre-teen."
4,A satisfying sequel,"After reading the first book of the series ""The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants"", I had to get the second one. I wasn't as thrilled as I was with this one as I was with the first one but I would still reccomend it.I really loved Bridgets story line. She goes to Alabama to find out about her mother and I thought that it was really good. I liked Lena's but it seemed a little too dramatic. She meets Kastos again and can't seem to go on without him. At parts though she gets a little too dramatic about him. Carmen finds that she is being pretty selfish tworads the end of the book. I liked Carmens a lot better in the first book. Tibby's wasokay. I never really thought she was an interesting character anyway but I do like her story line better in this book.I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who liked the first."
5,This should be your first book in strategic play and planning,"After giving ""How to reassess your chess"" such a bad review (one star) someone told me to take a look at Silman other book (Especially after he won the Chesscafe award for his latest book). And my opinion is that this is much better book for improvers. ""The Amateur's Mind"" is instructive (through the whole book) and gives a player (around 1500) a very good introduction in middle game strategic elements and planning.I believe I have to look at ""How to reassess your chess"" again, but until then I would recommend ""The Amateur's Mind"" as one's first book (1500-1800) in strategy and planning and for instance ""Strategic Play"" (1900-->) by Mark Dvoretsky as a good second book."
5,An Incredible Movie,This movie is one of those you cannot take your eyes off of from beginning to end. The dynamics of the relationships between the characters tells much about human nature.
3,A good overview,"This book gave a good overview of what to do in getting started in the adult industry including potential pitfalls. Although it lacked the some of the in depth instructions needed to get a person cemented, I think it is enough information to get your feet wet. The ""doom and gloom"" that was referred to in the first review is a reality, and only a fool would ignore the kernal of advice in the first chapter."
4,Mostly OK,"The book is what I ordered and it came rather quickly, but the product features a picture on the cover while the book I recieved has a plain white cover with no picture. Yet the content is the same so whatever."
5,Waylon at his Best!,"This album should have been a nr.1 just as ""Dreaming my Dreams"".....however it was'nt. When you listen to ""Lonesome On'ry & Mean you can hear Waylon at his best, the text's are deep and the melodies and the music is just GREAT country music! To me this is Waylons best album.Jens Munk"
2,The Overblown Tomato,"I picked up this book at a bookstore because the title looked intriguing. I got to the part, early on, where he hires a landscaper to set up the garden. Hello? Most gardeners I know stake out a plot of land and at the most rent a rototiller to get the ground ready. At that point I figured this book was not worth reading, not even for fun.I've been gardening in my Northern New York backyard for thirty years. I am in my sixties and sure I have aches and pains from it. That means I'm still alive. Yes, sometimes things work and sometimes they don't, but the taste of truly fresh food is what keeps me signing up every spring. I'm also driven by, the chance to be out in nature, to observe all the critters, not kill them, to breathe fresh air and get my hands in the soil. In our urban garden, there have been deer, skunks, raccoons, and possums. Hey, there's enough for all.I sincerely hope this book won't discourage anyone from trying their hand at gardening."
5,Funny and Thorough,"I like the author's sense of humor. Very ironic, but effective. And the book is very well documented and covers all of the crucial issues. It was actually fun to read, which I hadn't expected. I liked it a lot."
1,This is funny.,"This is only one of many books written by members of the LDS Church trying to prove to the world that Mormonism is also Christianity. Fortunately most people are not decieved, no matter how hard you try to name an orange an apple, it will always be an orange. Mormonism is the gospel according to Joseph Smith, nothing else. Daniel C. Peterson is just another spin doctor for his faith. Those who are really interested in Mormonism should read: ""Mormonism-Shadow or Reality"" by Jerald and Sandra Tanner."
1,Not what I expected...,"I expected the color to be RED like in the picture... but when I opened the box it was a BLUE money jar! I wanted red to go with the rest of my decor... I have been trying to get a hold of someone at tumble weed and I keep getting answering message saying they are on the other line. I was sooo excited about getting this, only to open the box and see a different color. Just beware its not the color in the picture and you have no control over what color you end up with!"
3,Worth it or Bust it!,"This book is very well written, with solid legal definitions, along with additional case examples to show recent court rulings. I however feel the price paid for this book is a tad bit to steep! I have paid less for other labor books that are equal to the quality shown forth in this book. There is nothign so profound or so unique to justify such a expensive price."
4,An interesting and educational read,"The reader can tell almost immediatly that the author is writing about something she knows and loves. The pace is good and the mystery is always there, forcing the reader to dig deeper and deeper into the story. The side story (I call it) about the Conquistadors is very interesting to me as is the choice of the region written about. A good bargain for the money."
4,A useful guide,"I have used other gps systeme that were more elaborate than this one, but I like this one best because it does what I need a gps system to do and does it easily and without fuss. I do not have to pull off the road and read a manual to use its featurs and to figure out how to program it. It gets me where I want to go."
1,"Choose the Nuvi, you will be glad you did.","The streetpilot is old, clunky and about the size of a TV sitting on your dash. Get the Garmin Nuvi 360 and you will be extremely happy with the choice."
3,garmin 2720 gps,"I purchased the 2720 because my 2620 touch screen went bad and Garmin wanted $250 to repair it. After using the 2720 for a few months I now believe that I like the 2620 better. Its easier to get around in the pages, I can get to turn list much easier too. I am in the car wash business and the internal voice pronounces car wash as ""car washington"" which really bugs me. Also some of the same incorrect road names on the 2620 have appeared on the 2720. I reported this to Garmin 2 1/2 years ago. So, sorry but I'm not impressed with the 2720. I wish someone from Garmin would contact me to discuss these issues."
5,I'm never lost,"Considering that I can get lost in a closet, I invested in a GPS. I love it, and I would tell everyone to get something like this in their car. It makes it possible for me to find new routes to various locations, and to get off the main highway with confidence. I have programmed several driving 'vacations' into the GPS. The drives are more than one day - so I love that I can program a week of destinations into the unit and slowly plot my course along - get off the course if I want - and hop back on again to continue my route."
5,GPS,This is a great GPS. We now have 16 of them on the road with no problems. They are very easy to set up and they work great.
5,Best $400 I ever spent,"Wonderful, took it all over northern California including the bay area and mountains east, it even took us on forest roads and never got lost during the two weeks in unfamiliar areas. My mother was absolutely amazed and thinks someone live somewhere programs each trip."
4,Street Pilot 2720 provides muti-stop routing,"I purchased this model because it has the ability to build routes with multiple stops. Many of the units on the market now will only program 1 stop in a route. This makes the GPS unit have little value to me as I will schedule 8-10 stops in a typical day, and being able to enter each stop into the unit and have it auto-arrange it so I visit those stops in the most eficient way is what I like. I had a 2620 model and I am not sure which one I like better. The new one has better graphics, however there are more steps to the various features that I use. Overall, though if you can't find an older 2620, I would recommend this one. My boss bought one after riding with me and seeing how it works."
3,Easy to use GPS unit,"This is my first GPS unit and was fairly easy to get up and running though more hours of reading the manual lie ahead if I want to learn to use all of its features. As a home care nurse I use the unit daily and generally find that my routing gets me where I need to go quickly. The voice feature allows me to keep my eyes on the road and still follow directions. The unit quickly recalculates alternate routes when I encounter road construction or traffic jams. I also use this unit on my motorcycle mounted on a RAM mount, which works well. The two most annoying traits I've found, so far: It's impossible to make accurate entries on the touch screen with my big fingers much less using gloved hands, and the screen is very difficult to see when on the bike in bright sunlight. I understand that a hood is available that may help. Amazon's vendor sells this refurbished unit for a very reasonable 149.00 with a 1 year warranty."
4,Garmin Navigation,SO far the best one I have ever purchased. Only a couple of things that could be improved.. It takes to long to get to the view map screen... Sometimes it take a couple of minutes to search for satelite.. Recommend and internal antenna that mounts on the back... Once it gets going it has the best maps I could ever imagine.. I would never go on a trip and ask for directions anymore the Garmin just takes me too where I want to go.. This is a great item I would highly recommend it to anyone that is wanting a great deal.. This would be the one..
3,Odd Canadian Horror Film...,"Another flick I remember briefly from my childhood has only grown tastier with age! The acting was a little dry (it's Canadian, so I knew what I was in for!), and the deaths were not very graphic, so what made Funeral Home so special? Once again, ATMOSPHERE...the subtle manipulation of light and shadow, the characters that become slightly more menacing in each segment...I would have given it 4 stars, but I guessed who the person locked in the basement was half-way through the film. (if you've watched Psycho or Tenebre, you'll know too!) That aside, there were still some really tense scenes (protagonist knocking over a jar in the basement...you'll see!), and the killer's unveiling (though I guessed who it was) was still well-done and QUITE creepy for a film with so low a budget."
3,Not today's country [ in a good way ],"I give this a three when grading on a curve. I'm not rating that way based off of other people's albums but Waylon Albums. For instance if I lost my Waylon albums, which ones would I buy back first? This is not among those first. If you don't have any Waylon records this is definetely not the place to start in my opinion. Sure it's a good record. Obviously- it's a WAYLON record! There is always something good things about a Waylon album. But this one is very short and not particularly essential. Good album, nothing great. However when you compare it to his live at jds release or Honky Tonk Heroes or Dreamin' or This Time or well, his top albums- this one does fall into the mediocre range from that perspective. So enjoy it if you've got those other ones but don't start here by any means. That's my advice."
5,Boyhood Years,"I am now 70 years old, but still like to dance and listen to Boogie Woogie. The recent resurgence of Swing Dancing has brought back Jitter Bugging and B/Woogie. Boy could those guys play the piano!! Thanks E Schultz"
5,a fun yet thought-provoking read. Recommended.,"This book manages to capture perfectly what it's like to be a teenager. Then on top of that, some superpowers are thrown in, and as our heroes struggle to understand themselves and their bodies, they also have to contend with the prevelence of Mid-West bigotry, and what it means to be an unappreciated hero."
5,Wally MCDoogle,"Great series for pre teens. I read the series to my son, now i am reading it to my Grandchildren. Highley reccommend :-)"
2,"Fake, but . . .","I wish I would have read the reviews, I got a fake one and I'm torn becuase it works better than a loofah, but after a few searches I noticed I had gotten a fake one. Ugh, never buying form here again. But it is better than a loofah."
2,I too got ripped off,"I bought the yellow one and like many others, was sent a rip off brand. You can not list one product and send people another. Amazon needs to look into what is happening here. Change the listing!This thing works good but a little too good. I love rough exfoliation. I don't have overly sensitive skin or anything, but I have to barely graze this thing across me when I use it because it is so rough. The material is ok, but the weave of it makes it way too tough. I'm going to try another brand and see what that one is like."
1,Doesn't work,"Maybe this would work for bras with large cups (D+) but for smaller bras, these are absolutely useless. The holes are big enough for the entire bra to come out of the ball and even if it does not come out, the cups fold over on themselves and get heavy creases pressed into them by the inner ball. Or the straps come out while the cup is caught in the ball so the bra gets pulled and stretched in the wash. I got one of these at Ross for $5 and that was a huge waste of money."
2,Poor quality,"All together I purchased 5 BraBaby's. One broke within the first two washes, two broke within the first four washes, and the other two lasted maybe 8 months. The ones that lasted 8 months did a good job of taking care of the bra, but that doesn't do me a lot of good if they break."
5,very useful!!!,The bra baby is very helpful and useful.My bras remain clean and in tip-top shape all the time :)
2,Not worth the price,Not worth the price I paid.It didn't quite fit my washer and didn't protect very well my bras.
1,Deserves 0 Stars...,"I am disappointed to see these sold on here. This is quite possibly the biggest waste of money and plastic ever. It ruined my really good bras, and to top it off, when I contacted them regarding their product, they did not even have the decency to respond at all. I now have the Tide bra bag and couldn't be happier. Try that instead. It's virtually impossible for your bra to get twisted up or come out of the bag. You can even fit two or three in at once (if you wear a smaller size, like me, haha). I have also used it to was other delicate items as well. Don't waste your time and money on the Bra Baby. If you do, be prepared to go bra shopping..."
1,Epitomy of CHEAP Crap!,"I can't believe what crap this item is. The plastic is extremely inflexible. It was so difficult just to open the bra baby, by the time I got it opened it opened too far and off broke the little plastic hinge, never to be seen again. I was even more careful opening the second bra baby, (set of 2) and it broke also. What crap! Good Idea but not designed effectively. I have never experienced anything this defective!"
4,Bra Baby is ok,"This holder makes a lot of noise in the wash (and, especially the dryer). It does an ok job of keeping the form of bras. H0owever, you have to twist the bra in order to get both cups in the correct direction."
3,BraBaby,the item is as described however it is too large for some washers like apartment sized stackables and would not fit into the washer which i did not find information for that from the seller.
3,Big bras need not apply,"""Fits some D"" sizes. It did not fit my D size. Other than that it seemed like it would work well."
2,A great idea -- but disappointing results...,"I was so excited to buy this, thinking that I would never have to hand wash my bras again, which is such a pain! However, the Bra Baby comes easily undone in my dryer, thus defeating the purpose. I've even gone so far as to use safety pins to hold it closed, but it sometimes still comes undone. Even when it stays closed, the bra moves around inside, getting folded and causing the padding to get crushed. I've been reading reviews of the BraBall and it seems to be much better, so I'm thinking of investing in one of those... We'll see how that goes...Update: After having used the BraBall now for a number of months, I can say that it is far superior to the Bra Baby. Only problem with it is that it's slightly bigger and doesn't fit well in my small washer. But it's pretty easy to put it in open and close it inside and then it causes no problem. I would definitely recommend the BraBall over the Bra Baby."
2,Too Cumbersome to Use Regularly,"I was really looking forward to having this to help keep my bras in shape. However, it takes several minutes to put a bra in to the ball, and I just don't have that kind of time when doing laundry. I did use it once, and it kept my bra in the promised shape. I have since resorted to using the mesh bags, which also does a good job of keeping the straps from tangling up with the rest of the laundry load. We will stick with the bags."
5,It was good information in it's day,"This item was published in 1997. Thus, the data in it is a little old. These were originally sent out for free to psychiatric nurses and allied mental health professionals so that they could obtain continuing education credit. I would imagine those credits have long expired."
5,Wayne's Review,"If you love Celine Dion for her talent, rise to success and great humanitarian spirit you'll love this DVD. It is primarily footage of her non-stage activities during her Taking Chances World Tour with some bits and pieces of the on-stage concert performance thrown in. If you are looking for the music video of the concert then you want to purchase her DVD/CD package. Strangely, the concert video is only available in DVD format and NOT Blu-Ray."
5,"Howard Alden and Bucky Pizzarelli CD ""In A Mellow Tone""","I had the great pleasure of being in the audience with about 200 other astonished listeners as Howard and Bucky played masterfully on their respective 7 string guitars. They played each of the songs on their new ""In A Mellow Tone"" CD and while nothing can beat a live performance for shear ambience, the CD comes a very close second and helps me to relive those precious moments as they played. I couldn't recommend another CD as much as I can this one. If you are a guitar player, buff, Jazz enthusiast or just like to hear great music played by a couple of masters, this one is for you."
1,Never received the product or notification 31 days,"Chose this seller because they are in driving distance. Tracking info showed that they received the product and estimated delivery date to me was 11.07.08. Never received the product. After e-mailing them and 30 days later; I finally called them. They said it was returned by USPS; ""addressee temp. away""... We haven't been away in years.They credited my account back. I was never notified. My previous e-mail was never returned. They said I could pick it up at their store. She transferred me and disconnected. I immediately ordered from another seller. Will see how that works out. I have been to their store in the past and spent much $ through the years. Always got the feeling that I was bothering them when I was there. I think the salesmen have been there too long. They need some fresh blood who are interested in the customers needs. Retail is tough but nobody's holding a gun to their head."
1,Not Yet,"I have not had the pleasure of using my ML-3 Nikon Remote. I hope it works. I will make sure to rate it after I have had an opportunity to use it. I purchased it based on reviews, I hope you guys were truthful."
2,Not So Good...,"This little infrared remote must be used in front of the camera. So, its most useful function is taking portraits of yourself. Hardly worth the effort."
3,Didn't buy it.,One came with my Nikon. Pretty handy to have one. This review need ten more words to complete so here it is.
3,ok remote,I was dissapointed in that you can only use this remote from the front of the camera but other than that it worked great and the price was good.
5,It works great,These used to be included for free with high end camera. Now they charge for it even though every consumer could use it. Either way this is a must have accessory.
5,Great product,This thing is really easy to set up and use. My wife who is not real technicaly sounds even got it to work. She loves it!!!! buy this thing if you need it... works great for family shots so everyone can get in the picture!!!
5,Love It!,"We have been anticipating the delivery of this product. It arrived on time, and works like a charm."
4,works nicely,"This is a very handy thing to have. I have used it a couple of times, and it works exactly like it is supposed to!"
5,Fantastic!,"Works as advertised! It's fantastic. Not sure why I didn't get one of these a long time ago. If you have a family and you are always the one taking the photos you should get one of these so you can be in them also!Decided to buy the Nikon branded remote vs the generic, for $25 why risk it. I'm sure the other ones work too but I know the Nikon will work as advertised!"
5,Just Buy it Already!,This remote works well with my D7000. I have used for many different circumstances like when taking family pictures. I will plan on using it to take humming bird shots on my porch. The remote is totally worth the price and beats running back to your camera all the time to do the self-timer. Stop reading the reviews and buy it already.
2,Nikon wireless remote,"Not at all what I expected from the picture presented on the web. Probably worth the price, but disappointing to me. Useful only if you are in front of the camera, and only a short distance away. You have to be in line with the infra-red sensor on the front of the camera."
1,Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote for use with Nikon D3100,"This was presented as a wireless remote for the Nikon D3100. It did not work with that camera. Just in case, purchased a new battery, still didn't work.Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control. It doesn't work with my camera."
3,Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote,"This is a very basic, and very inexpensive addition to your Nikon camera kit. Works great for self-portraits, and shooting with a tripod.Can't imagine anyone not having it!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007EDZG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Limited range,"Too bad this is the only option for use with my Nikon D80 camera. I found the unit to be very directional, with a short range. I bought it mostly for close up nature shots, so it will function as a shutter release when I'm right on top of the camera."
3,It's okay...,"This remote works fine, but not great. The range is somewhat limited and you have to point the remote directly at the camera for it to work. As a result, I have recently taken a lot of photos of myself trying to get the dumb thing to work.On the other hand it is very small and extremely handy, just don't misplace it or you never may see it again!"
4,ML-L3,Response time could be a little quicker but beats running to your spot when taking self portrait of oneself or with the family.
5,Great for the money I will buy another one,"This is one of those things that until you have it you didn't know you needed it. Now I wish I had bought one when I bought the camera, I use it all the time to take close up and remote pictures. I can now be in the pictures I take!!! Could use a longer range but if it is in direct line with the camera it works great! I will buy another because it is so small that I know I will lose it at some point. But it does have a very sturdy case that can be attached to the strap of the camera so that should prevent loss. I love and use it all the time now!!!"
3,"Decent, not spectacular","Just got it today. It is TINY, and I was surprised there weren't any instructions, but I got out my camera manual and found the instructions. Works fine with my D60, but I wish it would work from more than just a few feet away. Worth the $15 though."
4,Works on D70 too,"Ordered this remote for use with my D70 and it does exactly what it should. It's smaller than I thought, which is excellent. I can keep it in my camera bag all the time without sacrificing much space. The only downside is that there is no half-press control (common to all Nikon IR remotes), so there can be a delay if camera is in auto-focus mode. However, since the D70 has no remote port or factory battery grip, this is the best I can do."
4,Simple and cute remote - lacks a manual though,I ordered this through Adorama and received it within a week. It was simple and cute with a nice little pouch. Was simple to configure (after some googling and checking my D50 manual) and it worked as expected. A small 4 page manual needs to be there just to explain how to remove battery and operate for the first time. It would be greatly appreciated by all Nikon enthusiasts. Overall a very good looking remote which works perfectly. Thanks Amazon and Adorama!!!
5,Nikon d5100 remote,It worked from the start. Arrived in a very short time. It worked from the start. Arrived in a very short time.
1,How does it work,I'm sure this a grat product but I've not figutred out how it works with my camera - on instructions included - it is probably me - I'll continue to read my camera manual for assitance
1,duck,I am not pleased because it dosent work with my camara as stated with Nikon book however I am going to try it on another nikon product when it gets in to see if it is the make which is making this product inservicable. I am not ready to tthrow in the towel yet
5,"Great ""hands free"" product",used this on my Nikon D80. great for remote triggering while camera was on the tripod. it served its purpose. tiny & compact. perfect for my needs.
5,Very great!!!,"I'm very happy for what it does!!After using it for a few hours, I in love with it.Now i using it all time.I would said this is best for dslr camera user must have!! it.Get one and you will know what i had said."
4,Works per design,"This product works just as it is designed to do. Note: due to the limitations of camera operations, some features are not available w/ the infrared remote. The only time you can use the infrared remote, is when you have the wireless remote turned on; this works in instant picture mode and timer modes ONLY. It is, however, great for landscape, self-portrait and other situations that you'd need remote shutter control or minimal/no camera shake. Keep this in mind with your purchase, and you'll be happy you got this added tool."
4,Simple and sweet,"I was really pleased with it but I've found that the remote has a ""sweet spot"" that you have to hit dead on. Kinda annoying but still it gets the job done."
5,Works wonderfully.,"I recieved the remote 3 days after I purchased it, which was a nice surprise during this busy shipping season. I bought it to use with my D50, and it works great, even from behind the camera. The case it comes in is very handy - otherwise I would definitely lose it, because it is extremely small! I definitely reccomend it."
4,Must have item,"Inexpensive, durable, light-weight, purposeful.This item is a must have for all DSLR owners. Easy to use and works perfectly.This is a good accessory to have."
3,Could be way simpler. Very short distance.,"You have to be almost to the camera for this to work, and it isn't very responsive. Maybe mine came with a dead battery, because I had one before and had no issues. This one isn't very impressive though. I found myself getting very frustrated with it."
5,Does exactly what I need,Works like it should. I'm using it on a D40 and unfortunately it limits the remote time to 15 mins. Why limit me Nikon? why not just tell me the remote is on so I can turn it off.
1,Not compatible with the D3100,"This unit may be good, it may be not. But one has to know that it does not work with the D3100. There are people posting to the Nikon USA site asking the same question or now realizing the incompatibility. Actually, I would rather fault Amazon on this, as if you scroll along the ""People who bought this item also bought..."" for the D3100 you will find the ML-L3. Misleading I would say, as I am not the first to suffer under the confusion. The ML-L3 also gets one star for failing to include instructions in the box. Granted the ""Technical Details"" doesn't list the D3100, but I ASSUMED (bad, bad!!) that the D3100 was an upgrade over the D3000 and that equipment for one would be compatible with the other. Assume nothing, I guess."
4,Excellent for Astro Photography,I bought this remote with the intent of using it for taking Astrophotography Pics with my Nikon D50 DSLR. Just as I imagined my pictures are at least ten times as still as they would be if I pushed the shoot button on the camera myself.
3,cheap batteries,this product works fine but i had a big problem. the batteries that came in it are super cheap. replace them immediately! mine leaked and corroded the terminals in no time!
1,Doesn't work?!?,I bought two of these and can't get either one to work. It doesn't come with any type of directions. If I can get it to work I will update this review otherwise they will be going back.
4,Nikon remote,"We bought this to use with Nikon D90. It works okay as long as you point it at the front of the camera. I haven't tried a new battery yet but it seems like I have to be pretty close to the camera and it won't work unless it is pointed at the front of the camera. The sensor is by the lens on the front. However, it would be nice if it didn't have to be pointed directly at the front of the camera."
5,Great product,This is a great little remote. I will say that at times it doesn't connect with the camera...maybe if you are too far away or the lens is blocking the sensor on the camera. I don't really think that is the remotes fault though...just the limitations of the technology.
5,Nikon ML-L3 Remote Control for Nikon D60,"Just what I was looking for. Now I don't have to run to get in place to be included in a family picture. It also allows me to interact with people especially kids, when I am trying to get just the right shot. It didn't come with instructions but after awhile you can figure it out. So far so good."
4,Nice little remote for the D40x,"I bought this remote about 8-9 months ago, shortly after I purchased my Nikon D40x. I used it enough at that time to figure out how to use the remote then I put it away until 2 weeks ago. Happy to say the remote still worked with the same battery. I used it when taking pictures at the Grand Canyon and like another reviewer, found I had to have the remote close to the camera when using it (maybe the battery needs replacing soon?). The remote runs on a button battery; replacements can be bought at most stores which sell batteries. The only complaint I have about the remote is its holder which has a slot to fit the (flimsy) strap that comes with the camera, otherwise one must improvise or keep good track of where they keep the remote when they're not using it."
4,Nikon's small wonder......,"I added this remote control to my DSLR arsenal approximately a year ago and I am very much impressed with this remote control. I have used this remote for taking pictures for potraits,objects,family group photos, with the camera on a tripod. Its very handy and very useful if you don't want to use the in built timer in the camera and run to get into the picture shot. 4 stars....? because a couple of times there were issues with the range of this remote control. But overall satisfied with this tiny/useful accessory."
4,A must have for a tripod!,Is a great product! The only reason I have it 4 stars was that I feel like they should have a radio signal remote not a inferred remote. But it works like a charm.
1,THIS IS PURE JUNK,"THIS PRODUCT IS A PURE JUNK! HAS VERY POOR RANGE, YOU NEED TO AIM AT THE CAMERA AT A CERTAIN ANGLE, OTHERWISE, IT WILL NOT WORK, AND MOST OF THE TIME, IT DOESN'T."
2,Product review,"It is a nice tiny product but with little usage. If you do not mind about the brand name, you could find a more reasonable price from the Chinese made items. And besides you do not use this wireless so often, why pay more."
1,New Axim User looking for the ActiveSync Fix,I just purchased an Axim X51V. I have read user reviews that suggest doing an ActiveSync fix prior to using the device. Does anyone know the location of the instructions for the fix? It is very difficult to find on both the Dell and Aximsite forums. My one star rating is due to the fact that I have not used the Axim yet. Thanks.

4,Solid basic guide for do-it-yourselfer,"Ordered book to help me plan an RV electrical system upgrade. Found it easy to follow and it answered virtually all the questions I had about how to add a second battery to my RV, upgrade my battery charging capability, install an inverter, etc. Recommended."
