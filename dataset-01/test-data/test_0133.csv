1,It just gets worse and worse,"I've been using Office since the DOS versions, and I have to say, I have never liked it. Using it professionally in a publishing environment, I have to say that this is probably its worst incarnation yet. The office assistant is gone, but in his place are a variety of pop-ups and warnings which cannot be turned off. Outlook has not become any more secure, it is simply more paranoid, forcing you to save any attachment to disc, regardless. Word remains unstable, ugly, and functionally gruesome. It is one of the few software applications which can routinely crash my Windows XP system.If we hadn't standardised upon a number of VBA macros we had devloped in house, some years ago, we would almost certainly ditch this product and use something else. We should never have standardised upon this software: it was one of the worst business decisions we, as a company, ever made."
2,Registration needed,"That is very good software, but i would like in the dictionary include pronunciation of the words searched...The Outlook doesn't convince me, is so slow and make a mess on my other e-mail accounts. On the whole Out look is very good idea but it needs its improvements. I tried to send mails with pictures and the receivers never got it,they just received the terrible red ""X"", I just hope went i uninstalled from my computer I can re-install on other one, because it needs on line registration for continue installing..."
2,Not a good deal,"If everyone were still churning out stock options in their sleep and making money every time they went to the coffee machine, it wouldn't be so much of an issue. And if the licensing were less draconian, it wouldn't be so much of an issue.But since we actually need to work to make a profit these days, it's not really smart to spew all this money at software that you're not even using, most of the time, to create your product.Have your office sysadmin or techwriter or something try out StarOffice or OpenOffice.org for a couple weeks, then train the rest of the company on how to switch. Using the same software all your professional life isn't in the bill of rights and the smart decision is to switch to something that works, that you can actually afford.If your employees or co-workers are smart enough to make whatever they're making, they're smart enough to switch to a different spreadsheet."
1,Nice UI design,"That's all I have to say. Office XP tends to be quite unstable with my workstation (Pentium 4, 1GB RAM, Windows 2000 Pro). Oh, it has its upsides also. It has a nice UI design, the SmartTags feature are nice. But that's it. Just the (not-so-good) same-old same-old."
1,Not thrilled by the bugs,I purchased Office XP when I received my new computer with Windows XP. It was a terrible mistake. I've got nothing going on about MS and their registration demands. They have a right to keep people from stealing their stuff -- but when they sell expensive software that is full of bugs on the software platform it was designed for?!?! I was so less-than-impressed I got my money back. And that took work.
4,FrontPage is now usable,"Here are some of my initial observations: Office XP has a sharp and appealing visual interface. The grammar checker has improved in its ability to flag sentence fragments. In the previous version of FrontPage the HTML editor would embed tags such as ""CREATED BY FRONTPAGE"" into my HTML files. I never used FrontPage because of this annoying feature. FrontPage has been improved so that you can edit HTML pages without FrontPage making any drastic changes to the underlying HTML. Microsoft Word style formatting or auto formatting is not impressive. It seemed impossible to get Microsoft Word to respect the format that I wanted using the resume wizard and resume templates."
2,Did not come with that Picture of the Box,"I did not get this item as this picture shows, very disapointed.and the version is an academic don't know what that means."
5,great filter,If your not driving a throw away car i would get one of these. Don't count on better gas milage maybe a couple of hp. Its definitly an upgrade from anything stock. Its an oil bathed cloth filter instead of paper. The oil catches much smaller dust particals then paper. plus with the K&N recharge kit it doesn't matter how nasty the filter gets it just like new again and again and again!
4,Great piece of equipment,"I have one of these in each vehicle, it's a must have if your on top of your vehicle PV as I am, a little high on price...but isn't everything the past few years."
4,"Nice sound, little performance difference.","This filter was very easy to install, only took me a few minutes. I put it in my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee, it sounds really nice and clean, it eliminates the choppy noise from gear to gear and sounds smooth. But I have not noticed very much performance difference yet. My MPG has stayed the same while I think the horse power may have increased by 1-5 MAX. Overall it is a nice replacement from the cheap stock air filters you can buy anywhere."
1,This book is horrendous,"I am currently an undergrad engineering student taking a grad level statistics course using this book. The example problems in the chapters have nothing to do with the actual review problems, and the review problems themselves have parts A-ZZ. The ""real world"" problems do nothing to help the student understand the statistical method and how to actually apply the topics discussed. The problems also do little to further the understanding of the materialThe material is presented in a confusing and obfuscating manner, meaning that to find anything relevant, you have to either look something up on google or find a friend that has taken the course previously do get anything done. There are also many review problems on topics that were only briefly mentioned in the text, and you have no idea how to go about doing the problem because the material was never explained.This book deserves no stars."
2,Hard to learn from...,"I had this book for an undergrad web based distance learning course. We covered up to chapter 9.This book is very hard to learn from. It seems to concentrate on explaining a lot of theory, but htere are not enough illustrations or graphs to be able to follow the discussion.In addition,unfortunately, when you go to do the problems, very little in the discussion or the examples are helpful in figuring out what to do. The sections on probability were especially guilty in this regard.The use of symbology is also confusing. Theta and Theta hat are thrown in to material with no explanation of what theta is representing.The attached CD has some good interactive elements that were some help in understanding the material."
4,pretty good,"This is the first book of this nature i bought, and can honestly say its awesome. It tells you everything you will need to make a novelty license including, different printers, paper, computer software, templates, etc and where to get these items, it goes ionto great detail and walks you step-by-step through the whole process."
1,Lies,This book is untrue. William branham was a man of God. Authors facts are wrong and he is under the influence of Satan.
3,Not a self-setting clock -- and not waterproof,"First of all, it's simply not true that this unit has a self-setting clock: I have one in front of me now, so I'm on solid ground when I say that you'll be entering the time and date yourself (not that it's a big deal).The unit itself is fine -- it tells the temperature at the unit, and outdoors using a little radio sensor. The problem is -- and it's pretty hard to believe -- the outdoor sensor ISN'T WATERPROOF. I've had mine for a week: we just had a little light rain, and the sensor went paws up. It's dead. It is an ex-sensor. What? An outdoor sensor that dies in light rain? And this from a company in Oregon! You'd think they would know about rain! I'm about to embark upon the customer-service quest, and I'm sure it's going to be a treat.SUMMARY: if you live in the desert or some sort of sealed underground city, this unit is perfect for you. If, on the other hand, your area ever experiences liquid precipitation, think twice."
1,Not as described,"As others have pointed out, the clock is not self setting. Also, the outdoor temperature range is not as described by Amazon."
5,All Abouts are my son's favorites,My seven-year-old loves all the All About Videos. I recommend them all. He prefers to watch these over cartoons and other videos. I prefer them also. My son often reflects upon them when we are out in the world and he sees something that he has just learned about in his All About Video. The videos have been a great source of information and fun.
4,New British Art,"This is the best and clearest text on the YBA [Young British Artists] phenonomenon of the 1990s - required reading for anyone who is interested in Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman and their peers. A little spoilt by a certain Marxist rigidty of attitude but highly intelligent and frequently amusing as well."
5,Worth It,"It's not just that this collection contains the impetus for the future 2001. The stories here are truly well-written. I was repeatedly fascinated by his invasion into foreign and alien cultures and psychologies. I was intrigued at the beginning of ""Second Dawn"", not sure where it was going- and then astounded at the sadness and horror and truth of the ending. ""Breaking Strain"" was not what I expected, and tragic, and when I finished it, what must have happened. ""Expedition to Earth"" took a bit too figure out- but was quite humorous. ""Superiority"" and ""Loophole"" really reveal the nature of war, as ""Nemesis"" reveals the nature of hate. ""Hide and Seek"" is a fun bit of fantasy. And then we come to ""Sentinel"", which started it all...What I am saying is every story here is engaging. Every story brings us in to a new world. Every story is not only well-written, but though provoking. It is Arthur C. Clarke. Worth every moment of reading every word."
1,Works only briefly,"This is the product I bought that has a remote sensor (which I also reviewed) which eventually gives up working. That is, even when reset (leaving batteries out for an hour after talking to the company) and with non-rechargeable lithium batteries, the base and remote sensor stop communicating. I had it for about a month the first time the communication stopped, then it progressively went downhill from there: the two stopped communicating after 20 days, then 15 days, and now will not communicate regardless of what I try (even sitting an inch apart). Definitely pass this up if you want something dependable for the long run!"
3,"Nice Mug Rack, But Be Careful","This mug rack is attractive and the wood matches our cabinets perfectly. The only problem is the cheesy little triangle hangers that are on the back. I should have known better, but we hung the rack and loaded it up with all our favorite mugs. About two days later we came in to the house to find a giant mess of broken mugs on the counter and floor. I think two survived. We were not happy campers. The solution is to drive a good sized wood screw through the rack into the cabinet. We used 3 brass screws and that fixed the problem."
4,A perfect match,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my umbrella base. I had purchased green patio furniture from Costco and this base matches the set perfectly. It was easy to assemble and fits nicely under the table. Unfortunately it seems to rock a bit, but that could be due to uneven boards on our deck. Adjustable footpads that could compensate for such surfaces would have made the base ideal."
5,"But wait, there's more!",A new 2005 edition is due soon and may already be out.Why buy the 1995 version?
2,Exactly Trash!,"Too fragmented, no flow, for me gave an insight to Joe's acting abilities and as well as the writer(s) and director."
5,Amazon thank you,So needed !!! Couldn't find them anywhere! Finally my daughter-in-law said try Amazon........I did! Thanks! These are so simple to use and not expensive .
4,Our rabbit LOVES this mix,"Have tried several varieties of rabbit food, this is the one that out rabbit gets excited about. Has LOTS of interesting bits of fruit and dried carrots and assorted seeds, while many other brands/varieties have only a little sprinkling of ""extras"" in among the ordinary pellet type food. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that at the moment it's showing a price of $14.49 for a 4.5 lb bag. The same bag goes for $9.99 in our local pet store."
5,Allman Brothers' Debut,"A great debut by the Allman Brothers Band. Though they would make even greater music, with Duane's guidance, this album still stands the test of time."
2,"Makes a good point, but...","Professor Gumerlock makes an excellent point in the introduction of his book, in summing up the LCD of all the soothsayers and so-called ""prophets"" throughout recorded history. Very good arguments are also made in the opening to set the ""actual time"" certain prophecies were made. But then, and even by Professor Gumerlock's own admission, this ""book"" carries on in the manner for which was its' main purpose; to gather in one end-all publication all of the prophecies made - and the prophets who orated them, in chronological order. Great if you're doing an essay or report on the subject at hand...pretty dry material if you're on the outside wanting a provocative read on the subject. Amazingly well-researched, footnoted and referenced, but again - very dry material. I got the point after the introduction."
5,A Classic Return,"Stiff Little Fingers' newest album is a great punk record. It is alot better than any of the newer punk bands out right now. Jake Burns still has a great voice after all these years. The guitar is as heavy as it ever was. And still the reggae influence is still strong. This album also has a tribute to the late Joe Strummer, whose former band The Clash was a strong influence on SLF. Favorites include Guitar & Drum, Strummerville (for Joe Strummer), Can't Get Away With That, Walkin' Dynamite, Be True to Yourself, Best of Fools, I Waited, Achilles' Heart, Who Died and Made You Elvis?, and Protect and Serve. Highly Highly Recommended."
2,Good for a quick Glance,"This book very informative in dealing with the identity theft that is present in the US which is what I was interested in. However, I did noticed it was lacking in content when dealing with other countries. For this one needs to apply previous knowledge of local systems to understand what Newman is describing. For anyone interested in Identity theft I recomend this for a once over lightly te get a quich understanding on a large topic. This book is suitable for the general public who may know very little about this crime. However, there really is no new information to be gleaned from the book."
4,Perfect Overview,"If I'd had this book before I sold my car, I wouldn't have had my identity stolen. Author John Q gives an overview of identity thieves that lets you know what areas you need to look out for. Also gives you information on the tedious follow up while you try to repair the damage done--who to contact, what to say or write. This is a real good book for the average person who is just trying to protect their privacy. I hope Loompanics has him write more on this subject. I checked with them, but although there is more in the way of privacy books, no other identity theft books come close to this for clear, concise information."
5,A Must for All Christians!,"This book is a must for all Christians. This book expalains why the saints go through trials and how they can triumph by the grace of God. The book also explains the goal of each Christian, to be like Christ and how each of us can obtain that goal."
5,Awful,This product WAS USELESS WITHIN 6 MONTHS. SAVE YOUR MONEY. LOGITECH HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND NO FAITH IN ITS PRODUCTS. I WON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN.CHEAP COMPANY WON'T EVEN GIVE YOU A 1800 NUMBER FOR SUPPORT. YOU GOTTA CALL LONG DISTANCE!!!
5,"great reading, 5 stars,,, a call to attention, recommend to those who follow!","eye opener,,,,Stand to attentipn and stay informed,,,, would mske a great movie! a grea read, recommend the purchase, and the bargain price,,,, cant go wrong…"
4,Practical Strategies,"I found this product to contain excellent, practical strategies for using in everyday life. Although I already used some of the strategies, it gave me confirmation I was on the right track and it assisted me to put the finishing touches on how I dealt with ""loving smart"".Thanks DR Phil.... Huge fan!!!"
3,Some humorous parts,"I'm not a big Dr. Phil fan, however, this book was informative and I found myself laughing a few times. Much lighter than Venus & Mars which I was never able to make my way thru. As always, great service from AMAZON."
3,SELF-HELP GURU,YOU ARE MY HERO DR MCGRAW. YOU'VE HELPED ME IN SO MANY WAYS YOU CANT EVEN IMAGINE. IT SEEMS THAT YOUR BOOKS ALWAYS COMEOUT WHEN I NEED HELP. I'VE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE IN MY CURRENT RELATIONSHIP SO I GOT THIS BOOK. I HAVENT STARTED IT YET BUT I CANT WAIT. THE LAYOUT LOOKS GREAT AND LIKE AN EASY READ. I KNOW IT WILL BE HELPFUL TO ME.
4,A good read with good advice,Dr. Phil delivers great advice in an easy to read style. I've dog-eared a couple of pages I love to read over and over again. It definitely makes you think about the choices of people that are out there and how to sift through them to help make a good choice for yourself. It's definitely worth the investment.
4,Near great ultra compact camera,"I have had very good results so far with this camera. Video clips taken from the top bleacher at a football game were surprisingly clear played in Win Media Player. All still pictures taken have been superb except for those with flash. The flash is way underpowered, but I have been able to compensate for most of this with Adobe Photoshop. My only other drawback is that the control knob sometimes gets moved while in my pocket so I start to shoot on the wrong setting and a couple of times the power has accidentally been bumped on while the camera was in my pocket. Except for these very minor shortcomings, I have completely enjoyed this camera."
3,I had to take mine back and I miss it!,"I purchased this camera in May and it has been fantastic. Then 2 weekends ago I got this LENS ERROR and it failed to work. So I took it back to Costco for another one and the new one had the same LENS ERROR. Well I need a camera I can count on, so I am going Canon!"
4,Great slim camera,"love the camera size!great batterygreat large screengood flashgood selection in the menueasy to use (i dont read the manual but i can operate this camera just like that...)very nice slim design..very sophisticated!takes great great amazing detail pictures OUTDOORnot very satisfy with the result for pictures that taken inside.. it might be my lighting source..but so far this camera took just Ok indoor pictures.great price for 7.2 mega pixels cameraeasy usb/charger deck (i am on Mac/os x, have no problem at all), downside: deck is too big to carry for travel.overall: very satisfy with the camera :)"
1,"worst ever, never focused properly, ruined our newborn photos. AVOID","Ruined two sets of vacation photos and our baby photos. Never focused properly. Warranty, support was worthless. We purchases a Canon digital SLR and are much happier. Avoid this camera at all costs! It caused nothing but heartbreak."
2,LCD Problems are an issue,"Size is great for traveling, but I continually have LCD issues. I sent it back to manufacturer and they fixed it once. Six months later, the same splotch occurred on the LCD screen. Of note, it was not cracked, just a malfunction of the internal guts of this camera. I would not recommend this camera for this reason. Others have reported similar problems."
1,Lens errors,"I bought this camera four weeks ago.Great camera if you are lucky enough to get one that works.I had exchanged it two times! other words two out three did not work properly and showed the same problem that shows as follow:The camera works just fine for 2 or 3 days then the first sing of problems is that when you turn it on and try to focus (1/66, F2.8, ISO 100) it just doesn't focus (the small square gives you a red one the shooter is half pressed), however if you move the zoom to a different position works fine.As you use it deteriorates to the point that when you move the zoom in or out it turns off and display the message ""lens error"" this keep appearing more and more until it becomes unusable.I had the same issue with the first two cameras (the original purchase, and the first exchange)I am now on my third one(yes it is crazy!!) this last one appears to be from a different mfg date or lot (you can tell by the S/N)."
4,To be a great small consumer camera it would need optical stabilization,"This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time.Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it.Ease-of-use- Great.Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files.Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time."
2,There are better cameras out there in the same price range,"I purchased this for an office that had both advanced and extreme novice users; other reviews had assured me that the picture quality and ease of use would be worth it. The camera was very easy to use, but the picture quality was horrible -- simple images were pixelated and not very clear at all. I ended up going to a camera store and purchasing the Fujifilm Finepix E550, which is also easy to use and in the same price range, but with much finer images."
3,Worked well... when it worked!,"I just returned my camera. I loved it until it stopped focusing any piture. Casio was NOT very helpful and luckily I was able to return it to the store where I bought it. I am thinking about getting another one, but am worried I will have the same results."
4,An awesome band from Scratchie.,"This is a great album!! (Forget the name, they're not heavy.) Listen to #1 and #6."
2,"Product is fine, don't recommend buying it online.","The product is ok, but I do not recommend having it shipped to you in the summer. In Atlanta. It arrived having melted at some point and re-consolidated itself inside each wrapper."
5,Great,"Great snack. Has 230 calories, not 210 as stated, other than that, its very tasty and filling. Fast shipping too. I recommend this product to athletes."
2,The bars themselves are outstanding but.....,"be VERY careful ordering these from Amazon in the summer months. These are normally my very favorite low carb bar, hands down...not only are they filling, but they taste great too.The last order I received however, and this was still in May, was a complete MESS. The wrappers looked fairly normal but after opening the wrapper you could see that the chocolate coating had previously melted and hardened again so it was completely stuck to the inside of the wrapper. To make matters worse, as soon as each bar was opened the chocolate flaked off the wrapper and went EVERYwhere. (Can't even imagine how it must be to order them in July or August!) It's a great product but until these hot months are over I'm opting to pay $2.29 a piece at SuperFresh!"
1,Very Bad,Once again I've received a heat sensitive product in a melted condition.NEVER again Amazon!
3,About What You'd Expect,"These bars are somewhat better than other low-carb bars: Crunchy texture is nice and taste is good. Unfortunately they are loaded with 19 grams of poop-inducing Maltitol, not the friendlier Erythritol. Still I enjoy them - mainly in the privacy of my small office LOL"
4,Okay,"I thought this item would have every single tempo, but this metronome skips. I wanted one that didn't skip, but I've learned to make do. The tuner-metronome duo is perfect though, one convenient and functional item. I recommend this product fully, but you should know it doesn't have every single tempo."
4,Great deal for the price,I bought this particular tuner and metronome because it was recommended by my daughter's flute teacher. It is nice and small so it's easy for her to carry around and helps her keep her flute in tune (she's used it in her band lessons as well to ensure her tone is right on) - her teacher even made a comment about how she has the perfect tone.
3,Very popular,"This is one the most popular metronome/tuner out there. It is a little confusing to use at first, but it becomes easy. I like the duo function of the devise, although I would like the devise to be made smaller."
2,This tuner Not road worthy!,"I'll keep it short. I liked the tuner, but in only four months it broke for no good reason. And yes, I changed the batteries...a couple of times."
1,Metronome doesn't work. It's only a tuner.,"I ordered this product on this website after seeing all the good reviews about it. It has been used as a tuner for the past two months with no problems till today when the violin teacher wants to teach my boy how to use it as a metronome---------it just shuts itself down completely every time she pushes the ""start"" button. After going through the whole user's manuel and package box, I don't see any warranty or contact information anywhere in the U. S. besides one phone number for Japan. I should have bought it here locally so that I can get replacement more easily. Now I can only hope the merchant I bought this tuner/metronome from will take care of me. It's really not worth saving a few dollars buying on-line. I should have known better."
3,Korg Tuner/Metronome,"The Korg TM-40 is a good Tuner and Metronome. The main assets it has as a metronome are that you can line out the sound so that you can amplify it, and you can start the metronome with a button so you can sync with a recording. Minuses are that you cannot choose an odd number for the metronome and it could be louder so you would not need to line it out. On the whole it is a good unit."
4,"Love Me, Love Me...","This is just fun, danceable pop music at its best. You will be dancing or bobbing your head or tapping your foot uncontrollably as soon as Your New Cuckoo gets underway. The Cardigans (with this album anyway) and Tahiti 80 are the best bands in the world for putting you in a good mood, and that's exactly what this cd does everytime I pop it in. Iron Man is just awesome. Great Divide is a nice tearjerker. Your New Cuckoo is just psychadelic, funkadelic fun, and of course, Love Fool takes the cake. Love me Love me, say that you'll love me. :)"
5,The Cardigan's best,"Though I'm sort of half-hearted in my love for Life, and a bit disappointed with Gran Turismo, I can say I totally love First Band On The Moon.This is a true bubblegum pop feast for everybody who loves good pop music. The single Love Fool is actually one of the lesser tracks on this amazing album.And you gotta love the Iron Man cover. Though it might induce a laugh when you first hear it, you can tell the band is really playing it for the love of the song, and not for a gag.Overall, the Cardigans made a perfect pop album here. It's smart & fun."
2,Not the Cardigans best.,This is the weakest Cardigans album. It's pleasant listening since the music is good but the vocals are bland and words uninteresting. One would never guess Nina Persson had any edge from hearing this. But she does. Gran Turismo and Long Gone Before Daylight are far superior. Their first album Life is also much better than this. And Nina's solo album A Camp ranks up there.
1,A total waste of time and money,"My time could have better been spent cleaning a toilet. What a waste of money to make this, it had potential to be a great story but the writers must have been drunk, high or both."
4,Solid Movie.,"I enjoyed this movie. I wasn't so sure whether I was going to like it or not, when I learned a good portion of the movie was through the lens of a camera one of the kids was carrying around (sort of like Blair Witch, in a way), but it ended up actually being pretty cool.The movie was very short. I think it was even under 90 minutes. Might have only been 84 minutes, if I remember correctly. I tend to like shorter movies (if they're not blockbusters), so I didn't have a problem with that. Just pointing it out.I didn't know any of the actors in this film. Not a single one. It's always cool when you see a good new movie with not a single big-name actor in it.I see there are generally favorable reviews on here, and for good reason. Go check it out."
3,Not to watch with your kids,"Looks like it could be a good show but I was watching with three of my kids ages 12-16 and I did not feel it was appropriate for them. We ended up turning it off and not completing it. Others may really enjoy it, just not for me."
2,Please don't waste your money!!,"I can't bring myself to give this hollywood garbage a '1 star'.....those are reserved for the truly, worst-of-the-worst; however, this is really, really bad. I'm glad I only paid $1 from a red box rental. I watched it with my 12 year old son and we both thought it really stunk...."
3,pleasant surprise,"An ok movie, I went in expecting a horrible shaky cam nightmare but they found a way to make it work. Other then that the story is ok nothing special though. So thanks to some good camera work the movie is ok and not horrible."
4,Way better than expected,I watched this movie by word of mouth and was very surprised. This is a cool flick. The trailers do it no justice. It heads off in a direction that was not expected. Very good.
4,A cool film!,"Chronicle was a movie that I've been meaning to see. Now I'm glad that I saw it here. Its has great story telling. The effects are very much like many movies today with the whole shaky camera, found footage thing. However, this film pulls it off better than a lot of others. The whole power corrupts theme this movie had going was really interesting. Overall a good 4 star film!"
4,Good Movie,"This was a good movie, based in the Seattle area and filmed from a different perspective than normal, enjoyed it."
3,Interesting,"I would not recommend this movie, but it wasn't a complete waste of money, as it was an interesting concept at least. If you see it on TV, tape it, but I would not pay to rent it."
4,Who knew...,this movie existed. Never saw any trailers in the theatre. And I go a lot. It was pretty good the effects were great. I think they could have added more depth to the relationship with the cousins.
1,Less than I expected,"Andrew's mom is sick. His dad was a firefighter, now he's a drunk. Andrew is considered a bit of a geek at school which is compounded when he decides to carry a video camera everywhere and film everything.His cousin Matt talks him into going to a rave. Then Matt and his friend Steve stumble on a strange hole. They talk Andrew into filming as they explore the hole, cave and what it contains. What is in the cave can't be explained, yet gives them strange powers and brings out their dark side.Most of the movie is filmed from Andrew's viewpoint--literally--as though he is filming the movie himself. As a result the story is raw and gritty. This filming style is not my taste and I found it rather boring. However, it is a pretty good illustration of the pent up anger kids can have if they face verbal and/or physical abuse at home and/or school. Especially if no one takes the time or energy to truly care."
2,Didn't meet expectations,I did not like this movie because of the camera and it did seem like the Blair Witch Project movie. Also if there is anything that this movie showed me then it is that don't give an emo kid super powers. Nuff said.
3,Chronicle,This movie was strange and one that I have not watched to many times. Not sure if my expectations weren't a bit to high for this movie.
1,Money Wasted,"Bought this movie because of good reviews and ratings. Watched it twice and still found it to be very trite with a story line whose conclusion was obvious from about 30 minutes into the film. I know I'm in the minority but, in my humble opinion, the movie was only worth one star. Save your money."
3,"good concept, slow moving",The story line was interesting. The Blair witch like videography was annoying at times. The characters were interesting but not well developed and the movie moves very slow.
2,Nothing special,"This is an entertaining movie for the teenage crowd but there is nothing special about this movie. This item appeared in my ""review your purchases"" and I had no idea what it was. I had to go back and read the description to even remember what the movie was about. Yes it was that forgettable."
1,Not for pictures of the kids...,"I did a lot of research before buying this camera, I was upgrading my curent HP Photosmart camera and wanted something with more options. I bought it today and got it home excited to take some pictures of my 10 month old. Well...every setting you have it on in the house shows the ""blurry"" caution. To take a picture you have to find the perfect touch on the button, if you don't hit it the right way it only focuses the picture rather than taking the picture. By the time you press the button again to take a picture your target (or mine being a 10 month old crawler) has already moved. This camera is definately not a point and camera. Also, it takes a long time for the flash to reset and the image to download and you can't take another picture until it is loaded. It is going back today."
3,"Cute little camera, but blurred pictures defeat the purpose","I received this as a Christmas gift. The gifter had studiously reviewed Consumer reports and online reviews, and chose this over a Canon due to recent LCD issues on Canons. I had been eying Canons myself, but was also concerned about LCD issues too. This is a cute little camera with many modes and options, as well as great video, but somewhat unable to enjoy it when many of my pictures are blurred. I don't have an extremely steady hand, but there is no way to correct this that I can see, and it gets worse when I have other people take pictures for me. I wouldn't recommend this to you unless you have a very very steady hand--try it out in the store first and see if you are able to consistently take non-blurred pictures. I am not."
1,"Forget it, too slow.","I will make this quick. Great camera features, all that u will ever need. Whats the good of having good features if its too slow and u miss the shot's, yes u will miss several shots in a row as the battery weakens. The battery door is weak as well, will break off.Keep walking, Nikon has much better cameras then this one."
4,Spyro- Above average in design & quality,I was delighted to find Lenox Spyro on Amazon to complete my set. My artistic eye makes this pattern irresistible . The spiral on the flatware makes this a good compliment to the concentric circles on my Fiesta china. The pieces are very well balanced and feel good in my hand. Spyro is a cut above the average in design & quality.
4,2 Tier Red Mechanics Tool Service Cart,This is a Christmas gift so I don't know much about it. The item came promptly during the expected time.
1,Unfinished manuscript,"I concur with Thomas Lydon - this book is a first draft and should not have been printed in this form. While the typo's are merely amusing (All of chapter 14 is titled 'Migrating to ARCHIVE Directory), and the occasional answers mismatched with the questions (NTDS.DLL in the question, NTDS.DIT in the answer) merely annoying, I found some major goofs. Example: They talked about applying password policies to an OU in their discussion of blocking inheritance, etc, missing the critical fact that password policies are effective ONLY when applied to a domain, not an OU. Aside from these solid examples, I felt that occasionally the explanations given of a subject were ""fuzzy"", as if the authors didn't really understand it - but that's just a personal feeling. Fortunatly, with the advent of Win 2003, this book should be less in demand."
3,Good book..,I liked this book. I've read simular books like it and feel Skip covered the same topics as well as the other authors.
5,Watching Over The Heart,"Watching Over the HeartThis book has the spiritual depth of Puritan writings but is in up-to-date language. It's a book I'll keep at hand to be reread from time to time for my own needs. As a Biblical counselor, I find this book better equips me to help my clients.Mary Moser"
5,Fantastic Find,"Our family loves Home Alone movies but it seems like we always miss the best parts or miss the beginning or end when they are on TV and can only be enjoyed around the holidays. Love that I was able to find the entire collection and for such great value. Our family LOVES it, ecspecially our lil guy."
3,KEVIN!,"Didn't want to pay a lot for this, so I was very happy with the purchase. The quality is not digitally remastered (which is noticeable), but still worth it."
5,Great Movie Collection,"This is a set of four movies that really gets the entire family together for quality time, which is really nice nowadays."
5,Janice J Tucker,"This book is beyond outstanding! One of the best books on victimology that I have ever read! Best bring out the hankies when you read Debbie Morris' account of her tragic encounter with the dead man walking. My heart ached for her as she related her story of what it took in her life to be able to forgive Robert Willie and come to some understanding with her own fears and hate. I won't spoil it for the reader, but suffice it to say it is more than a 5 Star Performance! My prayers are with you,Debbie. You deserve a wonderful life!"
3,Buyer Beware,"Apparently, the publisher is none too willing to do a full reprint or custom publication of this text. I paid full list price for it after not being able to obtain a desk copy. What I received was certainly not worth list price, nor is it a hard cover. I received a paperback version of the book, and the pages are, at best, photocopy-quality ... and shoddy at that.The book itself is useful, although incomplete in parts and perhaps too general for an advanced undergraduate seminar. For first and second-year students, however, it is accessible and its examples are relevant/timely. It does oversimplify critical/interpretive frameworks a bit too much for my liking. But, this can be overcome with a bit of creativity on the instructor's part."
3,Not too detailed,This book wasn't really that detailed but had to use it because it was for a class. If your into this stuff than take a look at it.
2,Very poorly written,"I was deeply disappointed in this book. The prose was stilted and spent far too much time explaining rather than showing the action. I was unimpressed with the heroine, Sarah, who spent most of her time sexually frustrating the hero. In addition, these two characters displayed rather ignoble traits now and then out of keeping with historical romances. I usually keep my books, but I threw this one out after skimming through to the end (I couldn't help myself...I can't leave loose ends, unlike this writer)"
5,Fast Furious & Fun,"The newest entry into the series featuring Shane Scully, HOLLYWOOD TOUGH, has Scully & his beautiful wife, Alexa entangled in the world of Tinsel Town heavy hitters and wanna-bees as they set up a sting to trap a mobster. This highly entertaining book offers an insider's look at the film industry with well plotted cops and robbers sequences and action thrills for the most hard-boiled fans as well as subtle humor that hits the mark with the similarities between Hollywood and the mafia. Highly RECOMMEDED"
2,Disappointment,I have always enjoyed Stephen Cannell's books...but this one was truly disappointing. I think the storyline bordered on stupid; there was nothing to keep my interest. Perhaps I am just sick of the Hollywood hype.......they can keep their ideas and filmmaking to themselves.
4,A good start up camera,"Pros: Excellent picture quality, Ease of useCons: Slow recharge after flash, Slow image processing, LCD turns off after each shot.Excellent quality pictures, ease of use, battery life,affordable pricing, and it's compact size anddesign all make this a good start up camera. Why just astart up? Here's why?NOT SO GOOD:The biggest problem is the lenght of time the cameratakes to recharge after flash. Not only that but alsothe slow image processing rate after a picture is takenand this is both with or without the flash on (3 to 5seconds wait). Also, after you take a picture, whilethe camera is processing the image, the LCD shuts offfor about 2 seconds then turns back on. Reviewingpicture you've taken is also be a task. Also, thereis no center gridline or center marker on the LCD orviewfinder for centering your object.If you can overlook, or not be annoyed by the NOT SOGOOD, then this is excellent camera. Great picturequality."
2,Nice shots... but too many missed,"My husband bought this camera for three years ago... it takes nice photos and is very user friendly, but the lag time between photos is very frustrating! I have missed out on too many photos because it is taking its sweet time saving what I just shot. I am ready to move on to a quicker camera with more options. I another Nikon may be in my future, but not before I test it out in the store first."
2,Really upset with Nikon!,"I previousley owned a Nikon Coolpix 2000,and just adored it. After 3 1/2 year's,it went caput. So I went directly to Nikon again since I alway's had wonderful pictures with it. So I got this Nikon 4600. All was great until I took a picture with the flash,and it took FOREVER (when taking pictures of children,anything over 2 second's is forever) for it to recharge!! The old Nikon was not like this,and I just dont know why they made it like this. The screen was also grainy looking. I ended up taking it back 3 day's later and buying a Kodak that is wonderful! Nikon REALLY need's to reconfigure this camera."
1,Problems everywhere,"The camera works fine until you realize that the batteries are down and you change them and still never starts again. Also is very slow when you turn it on (before not been able to turn it again of course) and takes forever to save the pics.Size and weight are prefect and the pictures you take are wonderful, but I think there are more ""downs"" than ""ups"" with this product..."
2,not bad when it's working but breaks down easily and soon,"I had this camera for about 5 months when the lens jammed. I thought the camera was a goner but eventually I was able to fix it myself. About 6 months after that I wasn't as lucky. I got the dreaded error message. The screen of death hasn't disappeared since, no mater how many times I try to troubleshoot the camera.When the camera was in working condition, it was pretty decent. The pictures are pretty good. Not remarkable, but sufficient for a novice. The video is very poor quality - grainy and remember there is no sound, so a lot of the tings that you want to videotape are going to be useless taped with this camera.If I was certain that my camera's death was one instance out of many, I'd even go as far as to recommend this camera to others, but from what I had read over the Internet, this is a common problem for Nikon 4600. Do yourself a favor and buy another camera, if you want it to last to its two-year anniversary."
1,Very Displeased,"I owned a Coolpix 4200 and was very pleased, it was a great camera, was out at Caye Calker and lost it there. I went and bought this Coolpix 4600, and boy was i sorry, i had 2 Nikons before and really believed in the company, but that was until i bought the 4600. Taking pictures with flash is a big joke, u miss your best moments waiting for the flash to be ready again, it takes forever trying to get the camera to focus in most modes. Was at my little girls graduation and got so frustrated trying to get it to focus to take a pic of her receiving her certificate. I almost smashed it. Very bad production by Nikon. They really need to do a recall or something. The Coolpix 4600 sucks big time and i wont recomend it to anybody."
2,SLOW,"This would be a great camera if you have time to wait between shots. I had a Sony Cybershot (DSC-P71) that is getting old (3-4 years) and dosn't take the quality pictures it used to. We own several Nikons that we are very happy with including a D-70 and a Coolpix 8700 so I wanted to try a Nikon ""pocket"" camera to replace my Sony. I was very dissapointed in the speed of the pictures. Besides the picture actually taking several seconds to focus and decide when it's ready to take the picture, it actually shuts down for 10 or so seconds to re-charge the flash. I gave up and decided to return it after only 2 hours. I will buy another Sony for my ""pocket"" camera they have a much faster turnover time between pictures."
2,sloooow shutter speeds,"Check the film speed for this camera - the ISO speed (once called the ASA speed).You won't find it.It used to be listed as 50 ISO, but it is actually 25 ISO, so they stopped listing it.You can determine the film speed by taking a picture of a gray card, checking the shutter speed and f stop stamped on the digital file, and comparing it with a light meter.The film speed on this camera is abysmal, which is why it is always shooting at a slow shutter speed, and warning of hand-held blur, even outdoors."
2,Not a good camera.,"I have had this camera since 2007, and to put it this way, I hardly ever take pictures anymore just because of the camera I have (and I LOVE to take pictures). The battery compartment cover broke very easily, and goes through batteries very quickly. It commonly has error messages with SD cards. The lens cover spontaneously broke one day (and no longer covers the lens). The pictures are a complete gamble. It is very hard to get a decent picture, no matter how you change settings. Indoors pictures have about a 5% chance of being decent. The zoom is horrible; you will get a blurry picture if you're more than 3 feet away from the object. This camera has become such a big headache for me that I just bought a new (different) camera. When a camera gets in the way of your HOBBY of taking pictures, it's time to get a new one."
3,"Some good, some bad","Mostly 70's/80's music with some real winners and some real losers, maybe more of the latter depending on your musical tastes. Most are name artists, but I find it hard to believe that these tracks were all ""No. 2 Hits"" as the title implies. No. 2 on which list, you might wonder.Great selections by Peter & Gordon, The Hollies, Kenny Rogers, Blondie and others. But it's about one and a half CD's worth of good music padded out to three CD's. I found this at the local library and was glad I had not spent $20 on it. I recommend you buy this on sale."
2,VTech v2600 Handset for v2656 and v2651,"The phone arrived in about 5 days and was new as stated (it is an old phone model from @ 2003). The original system came with 4 handsets. I bought it to replace 1 which was lost, and 2 which have deteriorated in sound (hearing) quality recently. The original system worked great for about 7 years. Unfortunately, it did not work with my system which is the one listed, the Vtech v2656. And, because the model is so old, they discontinued support for it on the VTech website. If it was compatible, as stated, I would have rated it a 5."
3,SuperCrew light install,"Hello all,I have just finished the install of a smoked lens led third brake light in my Supercrew. It was not the ""No tools other than a phillips screwdriver are required {recon website}"" or ""Quick & Easy installation in minutes: Uses existing holes without modification or drilling [from Amazon] install as advertised. Having to either try to pop out a couple of white tabs or in my case - cut them off, since getting any leverage on them was very difficult and either way, I did not see any way to clip the plug back in once done. BTW, without the connector clipped in, am I to expect some rattling from that area now?Ford hopefully had a reason to clip in the connector and without me using a couple of wire ties, it should not rattle.On the other hand, it fit fine, looks great and I have to get the wife out to hit the brakes so I can SEE THE LIGHT. :)Thanks to the CSR that talked to me, buy Recon should have a install FAQ for this."
3,"Neat idea, but laborious reading","I seem to be in the minority here, but I was not blown away by this book.I found the plot ok, but there were simply too many characters presented one after another in too few pages. It became laborious to keep track of them all. On top of that, I found the author's writing style to be awkard at times, forcing me to reread sections multiple times throughout the book in order to understand what the salient points were."
5,The Oxford large print dictionary is perfect for us,"Hi,We purchased this dictionary to replace a smaller paperback Websters dictionary. It is hardbound and a nice quality book. We purchased it because it also included a Thesaurus ( word use help) but mainly because of the large print. We are both over 50, and have to wear reading glasses. The large print is perfect for us.D&O;,Portland"
3,good for an elementary school child,"the book itself is in pristine condition. it's in ""simpletalk"" which i hate. There is not an extensive vocabulary here. good for young children i guess- NOT for adults who want to expand their knowledge. a couple of days after receiving it, i put it in a recycle bin - it was just too juvenile for my use."
5,Terrific Dog Trainer,Book is brief and to the point with pictures for each step of training. The best part of the book is: I didn't have to read the whole background of dogs before I could actually find out what I was supposed to do to train my dog.
4,2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab,"I bought this for my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab, and I'm glad I ignored Amazon's ""Find Parts that fit your vehicle"" feature. Why? Because I checked with the manufacturer. I have complained to a service rep, but what do they care? I've also contacted vendors, and they do not like the feature either. I know it's not perfect, but it's still a waste of time and money to send your orders back.Now that's out of the way, the dash cover fits perfectly on my 2012 Tacoma.Btw, mine came with missing self-adhesive hook fasteners."
5,It's Out There!,I run with this music. I never heard of this group before. I bought the CD because it was recommended. Very tribal. The native lauguage with the traditional instuments and other worldly sounds.........all I can say is with this CD I am not running in the 20th century.
4,Smooth,"This is a great cd, not A+ but definately easy to listen to, pleasant to the ear and makes some wonderful background music for work or study."
5,"He's short, but cute...","Inspector Alan Banks is a big city dropout, now working in the northern dales of England. His personal life is interesting - wife and kids, friends, hobbies, a love of all kinds of music - but, as is true for many detectives, he's really married to his job. Banks is a clever and humane policeman who doesn't like bureaucracy, but who does care about the victims of violent crime and wants to bring justice to the perpetrators. Good plots, good writing, good main and minor characters."
4,The Female Brain,I haven't read the book yet but if it's anything like the male brain it should be really good. I ordered this book with the male brain book so it also came on the day I was told. It was also wrapped up nicely. This book is good for anybody who needs to understand the female brain.
1,It went into the trash,"I read this as a layperson and came to the conclusion that it was a skewed collection of misinformation meant only to cushion between its pages the promotion of specific drugs. The only thought provoked by this book was, ""How much did the drug companies pay her?"" I keep or donate all of my books. Not this one--it went straight into the recycle bin."
1,Check the research,"There is no evidence that women speak roughly 3 times as many words per day as the author asserts. In fact, existing research indicates a rough equality, or even that men speak a little MORE than women. Nor is there any support for her assertion that men think of sex every 52 seconds. These beliefs are part of the popular mythology, but they don't appear to be supported scientifically."
3,The Female Brain,"Interesting facts, but moves slowly. She takes a long time to make her point and goes into great detail that I personally found unnessecary."
5,Finally a book that tells it like it is,"The Female Brain was a wonderful read it was full of real, matter of fact iinformation. I really appreciated finding out how my brain was effected by hormones. It was so interesting. I would recommend it to women of all ages."
4,Good Book,"Great book.Really easy reading. It gives the reader an idea of the mechanics of the brain in this case the female brain. I personally enjoy this book it gave me a lot to think about, and it help me understand why females react differently than males in different situations. As a avid reader of psychology and philosophy I disagree in some aspects of freewill that the author describes in this book. I truly believe that we are a combination of nature and nurture. If you believe that all of our actions are the result of chemicals reactions in our brain this is a book for you. Over all I like this book and I would recommend reading it to anyone that is interested in Gender Studies, Women's Studies, Psychology and Sociology."
2,"Part Revealing, Part Depressing","Read as a man, the book basically tells you that, no matter what you believe or what women say about the qualities they are looking in a man, they are hard wired to choose the one with cash, a house in the Hamptons, and clothes from Bergdorf & Goodman. I knew that already. So: squander your money (if you have any) or stay single. Good luck."
2,A misstep in the series,"Being a big fan of the first three releases in this series, I was expecting more of the same from U.D. 4. Nope! This is a lackluster collection of already over-played schmotz and dopey remixes. While my faith in the series remains strong, there's little chance I'll be revising this collection with any regularity. Disc 2 is especially tedious and, oddly, not dance-able. Move on!"
3,Pretty decent CD,"Okay, I've listened to the set a few times now.. and it's not that bad. In my opinion CD 1 is much better than #2. It's got a fair amount of ""pop"" type tunes but Louie does a pretty good job of threading them together. Yes it's kind of like a sugary dessert but I liked it. CD 1 really kicks in after the breakbeat after about the 3rd or 4th track.. then it's on overdrive.CD #2 is just boring, imo. I don't know what happened there."
1,DID LOUIE FALL ASLEEP THIS TIME?,this cd was the worst of all his collection! it was mixed with new and old.. just didnt work in his favor. instead of this just listening to louie devito dance factory 1 and 2. those are much better... the only justice he made in this new addition was the remix of stuck by stacie orrico!! THE ONLY ONE!
5,Rare,This is one of the few internationally available recordings of contemporary music sung in the Makhuwa language. The production and performance are superb.
5,Best Music from Brazil !,This composer is the best... His songs can show you what is Brazil's best music.
2,too credulous about his source,"The notion that statements made near the end of one's life are part of an effort to get into heaven and so are uniquely credible seems a tad convenient and romantic to me. Sheeran could have had other motives for these statements -- he even may have wanted to commit a final bit of mischief by writing himself into famous homicides with which he had nothing to do.Those who are passionately engaged with the subject matter of this book will read it, and will decide for themselves what they believe or don't believe, of course.Personally, I doubt that this is the last word."
3,Book on Kindle,"the book is excellent, HOWEVER, i downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and so far have had 3 blank pages, I thought the first one was a glitch, second one I was ticked, third one I am complaining and I am not half way through the book"
4,ghetto falsehoods,"Ghetto Falsehoods is a great book by a first time author. It is a real street drama, that feels true to life. As I'm reading, I see the scenery, I'm in the projects,and I feel for the characters. I can see this as a movie. Anthony Whyte writes female characters extremely well. The slang is factual, as I have teenage children and had to have them translate for me in the beginning. As the story continues though, you get it. As an avid reader of new things, I'd reccommend this to everyone."
4,Too little of Barron,"Well, I bought it for Kenny's piano, but frankly there is not much of it - more of his fellows. Not critisizing of course, just a personal opinion."
4,Simple and functional,"What you see is what you get. It works, looks good, and is designed and built well. All you can ask of a product."
1,Only Pictures,"I bought this book expecting an encyclopedia. That is descriptions, methods... It is only a book of drawings not a single word of text. Is the first of 100's of books bought at Amazon.Com that I have returned."
1,Disappointing.,I found this book to be very disappointing. It lacks in text and supplies only limited views of structural landscaping designs via sketches.
2,Studio Gonzo slumming,"This schizophrenic four-part ""original web animation"" could never decide whether it wanted to be a sci-fi action series about nanotechnology and comet-borne alien viruses, or a romance between two young people. The point is likely moot, as both stories fail.The virus changes people into the usual mutant monsters fought using improbably advanced nanoengineered soldiers and holography. Thrilling. The two lovers are entirely unappealing. The boy's ""character"" is to smolder with generic rage all the time. At least he's one up on the girl, who has all the personality of a glass of room temperature tap water.What buzz the series had I can only attribute to Studio Gonzo's aggressive marketing of this unremarkable lemon. All I can give it props for is a bold soundtrack choice, with Kenji Kawai employing 70's style progressive rock."
1,dull,"Pretty much all mecha anime cliches with little new. There are some nice touches here and there, but you're better off watching Gasaraki instead."
5,A must-have for every new parent!,"Mommy Made is a wonderful book! It not only talks about the reasons why to prepare your own baby food, but also gives detailed, step by step instructions, helpful tips and recipes for how to do so. Thinking it would be easier and more convenient, I fed my first child commercially prepared baby food. It was extremely costly, the meats were horrid, and when it was time for her to eat table food, she rejected my cooking because it wasn't what she was used to. I vowed to not make that same mistake with our second child. In only 3 hours every couple of weeks, I am able to prepare HEALTHY & DELICIOUS food for my baby. Mommy Made has given me the knowledge and confidence to do so. It's a great resource!"
2,A Regurgitation of Bly's stuff,"This book was mainly a dumbed down, regurgitation of Bob Bly's ""Secrets of a Freelance Writer"" and other books. I guess if you're insecure about your writing abilities, or don't have a clue where to start (which Bly can help with too) this book might help, because the author comes across as a regular guy and etc. but there is nothing of substance here that you won't find in Bly's book. Maybe a LOT more of the author's day, the author's thoughts, etc. etc. Bly is more professional and detailed about the business, HOW to write copy, what you can reasonably expect to earn and much much more. Go right to the source of this information and buy ""Secrets""."
5,Bread mix,I love Pamela's products and use this mix as my basic and usually add something to accent the bread ; but it can stand on it own very well
3,Just ok,"I thought this mix was ok....it was a little too sweet for my taste, but the texture was great. I prefer to make my own from scratch."
2,Too sweet!,I don't understand why Pamela's has to over compensate by using so much sweetener in their bread mix. If I wanted a sweet bread I would add my own sugar! This is not a bread to have eggs and ham with. It taste more like a dessert. There are better brands of gluten free bread mix out there. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,No longer the baking mix that I used to love!,"When my son and I were diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, I was on the hunt for a bread mix that would make good bagels. I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden brown color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was! The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame! =("
4,Best gluten free bread,"I have tried many gluten free bread since being diagnosed with Celiac disease. Pamela's is one that is always moist, never dry and crumbly like so many others. I like it so much I am on the automatic shipment plan."
1,Tainted Product?,"I've been using Pamela's products with great success, ordering a case of the bread mix from the Amazon onlinePamela's Products Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)grocery every month. But in November, the bread started to have a very strange chemical after taste and also gave both my husband and myself serious digestive upset. I made a few more loaves to see if it was just one bag of the mix, but no, it seems to be a recurring problem. We also purchased a bag of Pamela's GF white cake mix from the grocery store recently and it had the same noxious taste and smell. What's up? I have three cases of the bread mix that I plan to return to Amazon for a refund."
3,Amazing Bread?,"I suppose if you have been gluten free for a long time this bread is great, but it has a slightly sweet taste (some may like that) and its much like other gluten free breads, its very dense. It is better than most I've had though and the price is right.. I use it for bread crumbs to make meatballs.. something I haven't been able to do until recently.Its a good product for the money, considering how much a gluten free diet costs - I just couldn't use it for bread.. it does however make a decent pizza crust.. haven't tried it for much else."
5,Delicious bread mix,"This is a delicious bread mix. We made it in our Breadman Pro on the Basic setting. It specifically states not to use the Gluten setting on the bread machine. It rose perfectly and created a flavorful tasting bread. We did not add any other ingredients and were very pleased with the bread taste. The package also gives options to use the mix in bagels, pizza dough, a sweet bread and pie crust. With Thanksgiving coming up, we might be trying the pie crust for my daughter who has Celiac Disease. I would definately buy this bread mix again. Thanks for making something gluten-free so tasty!"
1,A great disapointment,I only recognized 3 spiritual songs..and my church has a large compilation of hymns for mass. I was looking for the guitar versions of some songs found in our hymnal.
1,I guess I got my hopes up too high,"I have always liked the VTech phones for the clarity they had in my house. We had an older Panasonic cordless with an answering machine that has always had the shortest battery life, but when it finally got down to about 10 minutes of use, we had to get another one. We brought this one home, plugged it in, and it seemed like everything would be great, until I made a call. I could NOT hear the person on the other end at all, and I had the sound turned all the way up. I switched to another phone in the house and the call was clear. I had had problems hearing them before, so when the phone rang still plugged in, I answered, it was another person, and I could not hear them either. I'm not sure why people said the ringer wasn't so great, I could hear it loud and clear (and shocking because I'd never heard it before). Now we have to take it back and try to find something that will work. We never even got to try out the answering machine."
1,The worst vtech to date....,"I have no clue what they were thinking with this one, but it's really bad. The base has a ringer that you can turn off if you need to. If you don't, you can't hear the phone ringing. If you have kids, hide this from them up high. If it happens to fall in a couch, you won't hear the ringing or the page to find it. The battery dies very quickly. I've had mine for a few months, and the battery life is dreadful. It's dead in less than an hour off of the charger without talktime. I could replace the battery, but would rather replace the whole phone for all of the flaws instead."
4,Very Good Phone,"At least to me, it proved very good phone. It has answering system. Others had voice problems, but I never had such issue. Voice quality was clear. Positive from me."
5,Smart shopper,"I am trying to naturally lower my cholestrol and this product was rated very high, so I have only been on it for a month, but am confident that it will do what I need it to do."
1,"It's awful, just a-w-f-u-l !","Forty seconds into the film, there's a misspelled word in the opening title roll-up. It's all downhill from there. Wooden dialogue, inappropriate pauses, senseless nudity, Oh my! I can't remember why I bought it, but I wish I hadn't."
3,Worth a listen...,"I'm a huge Bjork fan, and after giving Volta many listens, my final decision is that this is Bjork's weakest album. It definitely has its moments in tracks like ""Wanderlust"", and this is definitely another take in Bjork's career, but honestly, most tracks could've perfectly been B-Sides for any other of her albums...(Maybe even the actual B-sides are stronger than this...) But even if this is Bjork's weakest effort, this material is far better than whatever you'll hear on the radio, so it's still worth a listen."
3,its good but not as a whole,if you asked me to name songs from this album i liked....i could only say earth intruders and wanderlust..those are the only names that stuck in my head..well..that and dull flame of desire but only because i recall a man sings and that and he adds a lot of vibrato to his voice..looking back and looking at each song... i like these tracks:earth intruderswanderlust (best one?)innocencei see who you aredeclare independancedull flame is interesting and thats it..the rest of the tracks are forgetable..it may be better than medulla but im not sure i have to relisten to that one....drawing restraint is maybe better than volta lol..despite it just mean instrumental..at least i can listen to that one all the way through without getting bored..selmas songs is too short to be an album imo..but its an par with volta..i recommend biophilia ..its her best since vespertine.
3,honestly disappointed,"it pains me to say it, but i didn't quite get attached to this album like the past ones. i am a huge bjork fan and would easily give 4-5 stars on all her other albums, but this one fell short. i was interested yet nervous when i heard she was collaborating with timbaland. not a huge fan of his work, but i think he is a pretty good producer for what he does and can respect his music. so it could have gone either way and once i actually heard it, it didn't work for me. somewhat of a similar vibe to Post, but definitely not as good. but being bjork, there were still some stellar tracks like ""Wanderlust"" and ""I See Who You Are""."
5,BJORK'S VOLTA,"This is a great work of Bjork, who always surprise us with a compilation of new sounds and nice rithms plus her particular voice.She did it again!good for her and great for her fans."
3,straight to the point --->,"Bjork - Volta (2007)With only a few exceptions, this album just doesn't gel or even arouse much interest. This is likely her weakest effort to date. Her musical approach, though always adventurous and fresh, still somehow managed to sound worn out by this point.But for me, the hard truth may lie in the fact that I finally grew tired of her spasmodic, juvenile-sounding verbal ejaculations. I just didn't want to hear any more."
2,:( :( :( :(,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I am very disappointed in Volta. Actually, it would be more accurate to say I am utterly distraught and frustrated. It lacks the cohesive, sophistication of a more grown up Bjork that lie in Vespertine and Medulla. I found some of it to be disharmonius, repetitive, and/or relatively shallow lyrically. You might expect this to be a compilation of B Sides; some of it sounds like Selmasongs, other songs are remniscent of Post, and Homogenic even.BUT, the album art and photography of her inside is amazing and everything I would expect from Bjork, I absolutely love it."
2,white tea,"order arrive in good time, the tea is not flavored enough with the vanilla. Can not taste or smell the vannilla."
1,DEFINITELY A ONE-HIT WONDER!,"I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE MUSIC FAN FROM MINNESOTA WHO SAID THIS GROUP IS A ONE-HIT WONDER. ""HOW BIZARRE"" IS A GREAT SONG, BUT THE REST OF THE SONGS ON THIS CD MAKE ME WISH I HAD JUST BOUGHT THE SINGLE INSTEAD! THE OTHER SONGS WERE BORING AND REPETITIOUS AND DEPRESSING. I WISH I HAD NEVER HEARD THEM! SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY AND JUST BUY THE SINGLE, IT'S THE ONLY SONG ON THERE WORTH LISTENING TO!"
2,generally lame,"There are only about 2-3 good songs on the whole CD; - the terrific ""How Bizarre"", then a cool, upbeat version of Randy Neuman's ""I love L.A"", and maybe 1 other song that holds any interest. Most of the songs seem based on a similar sound, and some even sound to be at ""slow speed"". I think buying it used is the best way to go, so as to not be quite so disappointing."
3,"A great idea, executed with mediocrity","This book is full of really great, really funny (mostly) scientific studies--but not all the way through. At times, it's quirky and hilarious; at others, it's just kind of there.Most of the stories are interesting, but the writing's not that great and gets in the way of it all sometimes. It's loaded with clumsy epimone, erratic spacing, and a rampant glazing over of facts.Then there's the appendix that lists all of the winners of past Ig Nobel Prize ceremonies, most of which were funnier-sounding than many of the ones that the book explored more fully.I'm glad I read this, but I don't think it's a five-star book--or even a four-star one."
4,I enjoyed this.,"it's slow to get going, but the more we learn about the relationships between these girls and their handlers, the more I appreciated the storytelling. long moments about girls growing up and finding their own identies capped with periodic bursts of extreme violence makes this a unique anime. I really enjoyed it."
1,Perversion,"For the love of all that is good, don't buy, watch, or support this in any way. Yes, the art is good. Yes it is stylish. But people are missing the point: this entire show is an excuse to show so-called ""moe"" relationships between adult men and prepubescent girls. That is the ONLY point of this series, and it is fairly emblematic of what is wrong with the anime and manga subculture. Just because there is no overt sex means nothing. It is guys ""taking care of"" little girls who spend all their time holding phallic symbols. It is sick."
2,I don't think it is 1000tc,"Yes, the sheets are very thick, but they are not as soft...I was very disappointed after I got this sheet set. I have another 1000 tc sheet set, they are way way softer than this one. My 500tc sheet is even softer...don't waste your money on this one....Like I said, the sheets are thick, but definitely not soft."
2,Disappointed..,"It was my 1st 1000tc sheets. I have washed it numerous times to get the ""soft feel"" but feels rougher than my 400tc sheets. It wrinkles out from the dryer. Although it is thick, consider other 1000tc sheets."
1,Easily Breakable screen! Expensive repairs!,"I had only had this camera for a week when I pulled it from my front pocket to discover the screen had broke. I do not remember bumping into anything at all, but this screen had broke under the pressure of my blue jeans.After talking to Casio's help line, they told me to send it to their repair center for repair. It was to be under warranty since I had only had it a week. Much to my suprise I recieved a bill for the repairs in two weeks time. The cost to repair $230 + shipping, which as you can see is nearly as much as a new camera. Im not going to pay Casio twice for the same camera, instead I will purchase another from a different brand. I would recommend to any one purchasing this camera to treat this baby like a newborn. Please do not buy it if you wish to take it parties, sporting events or any other place where it might bump into something."
1,P.O.S,"I bought this item about a month ago, took it to work and tested it out. i checked 12 brand new batterys and the meter only read 8.5 V on all 12. Then i grabbed another analog load tester to test the batterys, which with that load tester all batterys were over 12V. Had my matco guy send it to OTC, only to find out that they DO NOT repair these load testers, so they sent it back after making no repairs. Spend the extra money and go through the tool guys, at least you'll have some type of a warranty. but for something that isnt even accurate the first time you use it you'd think they would give you a refund. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!"
2,Being ethnocentric is funny. Ha ha.,"...P>Don't get me wrong - I'm big fan of Mr. Barry's: I think I've managed to read most of his published works and generally found myself laughing through most of them. There ARE some funny passages here (I know lots of people who have had the exact same reaction to Japanese cuisine as Barry), but they are few and far between. The general pattern of this book seems to be 1) point out something different from American culture, and then 2) reiterate that he considers it weird. Granted, trying to understand an alien culture is not exactly an easy thing to do, but I would expect some effort to be given to the subject.Usually, Barry shows a reasonable amount of insight into his topic (ex. ""Dave Barry in Cyberspace""), but that insight does not appear to be present here...."
3,"GOOD TRANSFER, NOT WIDESCREEN","Good print, nicely transferred. The cover, which is still ugly and uninviting despite the upgrade to actual artwork for this series, states that the film is widescreen. This leads one to hope that the film has finally been matted for 1.66:1 projection, but the disc contains the same 1.33:1 aspect ratio that has been circulated for years."
1,Did not receive the DVD,"I submitted and order, however, evidently the supplier would not ship to a PO Box. Although, I have received other DVD's to my PO Box. I understand if that is their policy. Amazon's action was quick and issued an immediate refund to the account I used. Thank you!"
4,"A great album, but with one thing wrong.","The album of LOTD is great and all, but they only have two tracks on the CD and cassette that have the tapping in it. Come on, you can do better than that. I don't really like the fact that the Feet of Flames and Riverdance soundtrack don't feature the tapping. These albums should not just feature the music. The tapping is part of the show you know."
5,"I loved every minute of it, I could almost feel the story in","it. I loved every minute of the CD. I could feel the passion, disire, and the rage. Truly an awsome display of the Celtic music."
5,Perfect!,The soundtrack and two exquisite show bits with tap dance! Perfect for home and car expeditions who make you want to jump on the spot !
2,"This is a pamphlet, not a book","Probably very informative, but so dry and statistical that I have skimmed over it, but haven't read the whole thing yet."
2,Wrote for organic chemists by organic chemists,"The information was not laid out at the progressive rate that should be in a introductory textbook. The book makes certain assumptions that cannot be picked up upon unless there is prior background in the organic chemistry world. The authors skip around and try to explain certain concepts before they were initially introduced. Peers of the authors would have praised the textbook, but the students had trouble reading and understanding it. That's why its...The book was written for organic chemists by organic chemists."
4,"works fine, semi-easy to program","I've had a T8112 for several years, not too hard to program and does a good job of controlling my high-efficiency furnace. I see that it is configurable for different fuels and furnace types, and supports A/C as well as heating. Nothing flimsy about this unit. All the programming information is on the door and I've never looked at the manual."
4,Great Resource,Book doesn't have even number solutions but does have all the odds. The main textbook simply gives the final answer while this manual has the explainations and graphs. I found many times where I did not understand the question as stated in the main textbook and was lost until I saw the actual solution in the manual. It was only then that I was able to figure out the concept. Overall I was saved by this manual and would recommend to others.
4,"Good, but a little obvious","I liked this book and would read more from the author. I was surprised that there wasn't a sex scene every other page, but I appreciated that! It was way too easy to figure out who the evil wolf was, but hey this is a romance novel so I didn't want to have to think too much anyway! All in all a good read."
4,A review from an English person,I purchased this out of curiosity. Having grown up with the original British version 'Steptoe and Son' I wanted to see what the American remake version was like as some of the episodes scripts from the first season were carried over. I enjoyed the season and the American actors make it their own. Fred Sanford AKA Red Foxx steals the show and it's hard not to like him.
4,Lulz,"I bought this because it was cheap as all get-out and I'm a young guy who wasn't alive to watch Sanford & Son when it was on the air (don't give me that ""It's on TV Land!"" crap, because I don't care). It cost me under $5, and for that price I'd buy it again. It's not something I watch all the time, or...ever, really, anymore...but it's damn fine comedy that will make you smile, laugh, and nod as you recognize it to be the origin of jokes you've heard countless time."
4,Like Bridget Jones' Diary? Similar feel here!,"This is one of those delicious little paperbacks that makes you laugh aloud with its acidic absurdity. Weldon assumes an almost ""once upon a time"" tone to tell a fairy tale gone bad, what happens when the once-rich-but-titleless lady and the once-poor-and-titled man split up. Splitting refers not only to the various couplings of Edwin and Angelica's little clique and their inevitable upsets, but also what happens to poor Angelica's mind as it attempts to remedy the situation. You cannot help but root for Angelica and to feel like and dislike for her various personalities, and even the ones you dislike will amuse you. Not a serious read, but definitely fun to curl up with on a rainy day. (Beware trying it as a ""read to sleep book"" - it's humour is too sharp for that; I stayed up much later than I should have for lack of reader self-control.)"
4,Laid-Back Post Rock,"This is an album to just chill out to. Don't expect dramatic swells or intense instrumental interludes. ""Casually Smashed to Pieces"" is more for a Sunday afternoon backyard or porch party. Even though the tracks are solely instrumental and all relatively similar, you won't find yourself bored by listening to it at any point."
2,If this is being professional...,"I was not sure what I expected, but this book has none the less not delivered it. Mr. Ball uses most of the pages on lists of do's and don'ts, to a level where it sometimes becomes comical: Don't sit with your elbows on the table, do cover your tatoos etc.Granted, there are some points in the little book, but parts of it translate to- Do spend your time serving others as much as possible- Do forget all about having some kind of personality- Do spend much more time on work than you'd ever imagine, taking away focus from you private lifeIt might be that I'm too european for this americanised book, or primarily have worked in more ""open"" companies than Mr. Ball, but if you follow his advice, you'll become a archetype of the grey, dull and anonymous worker in a large corp.My current company employes over 50.000 persons, and I've yet to see the need for all the rules Mr. Bull presents at any level in the organisation, so I think it's overdone quite a lot."
3,"Good taste; good price but, it could have been a better value","I recently purchased this energy drink from Amazon. The super saver shipping made the pricing reasonable relative to energy drinks as a whole. This product`s taste was very similar to low-carb Monster energy drink. My concern with this product is that it offers only vitamin C along with a healthy dose of caffeine. Most energy drinks offer an herbal energy blend, or multiple B vitamins or both. Still I do believe that for a low-carb drink the taste is very good."
2,"""dont judge a book by its cover...""","If your lookin for a little somethin to get you in the mood with your signifigant other as you crawl in to bed, this aint it. The woman picted on cover is not in movie. The chicks aint much to look at, ditto with the dudes, if anything this flick will probably make the two of you want to turn off the light, roll over and go to sleep. If your just into nostalgia, the ""old days"", go for it."
4,Excellent!,"Uhh.....not sure what the previous reviewer was listening to, but my Japanese Universal/Capricorn mini lp 2007 issue (#4988005459725) has a superior crisp & clean sound on my $2,500.00 stereo system. The only very slight complaint might be that these live dates have been pasted together from past performances but excellent nonetheless. So purchase (if you can find it) & enjoy!"
4,shell bracelet...bought an identical look for $1.00 at flea in FL,"These are really nice, but the one I bought has cheap elastic. This may not be exactly the same, to be fair, because I bought mine in FL at a flea market for $1.00! It sure looks identical, though. I just plan to restring mine if the elastic goes. The elastic on these may be better; I don't know."
5,"Excellent construction, very good directions. Nice product.","This is all it is advertised as plus more. Nicely done, gets you a working DTMF decoder quickly. Try it!"
3,Inconsistent,"First, let me say that I am a great Nikon fan. I bought the 7900 after owning the 3200 because I was seduced by the 7 megapixels. I agree with the reviewers who contend that the camera cannot always find its focus. Moreover, the general quality of the pictures is ... well ... inconsistent. Sometimes you get an eye-popping shot; othertimes, under very similar conditions, a disappointing shot.On the whole, there is much to commend. Incredible next-shot speed (almost no time at all), large screen, good handling, excellent compact size that permits you to take the camera anywhere, good value.So I'm not all that unhappy, but I wish the camera were more consistent and could focus better."
2,Boring,Too much unnecessary foul language. Could get past the first twenty minutes. If you like watching boring movies then this is the one for you
3,"Just an ""OK"" movie",Steve Carell is good in this movie. Glad I didn't pay full price at the theater to see it. Just an OK movie.
5,Good movie,I picked amazon movies over Netflix because the pick of the movies was better and I had a choice of the quality of the movie I could view. The prices are good and I enjoy Amazon. I don't have any problems with the buffering.
2,SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD,I PERSONALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE THE TRAILER LEAD ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS GOING TO BE FUNNYBUT IT WAS A VERY SOMBER AND SAD MOVIE ????
4,great movie,"great love story and even a feel good movie for it to be the end of mankind, highly recommend it"
4,Good flick worth renting.,"This was not your regular bust a gut Steve Carell movie, but it was very very very very very interesting."
1,Horrible,Don't waste your time. I kept thinking that someone was playing a joke on me. This movie is zero stars on a scale of one to five.
3,miscasting!,"end of the world had some funny moments, but steve carell(normally a fave) was really miscast as a love interest for keira k."
2,Film Review,The film itself is what this review is based on. I gave it two stars because I expected a better film out of Steve C. and Knightly. They are very good actors and most things that they are in is pretty good. Was expecting more of a comedy and this was not. The Amazon Instant was of high quality and the ratings are not based on that service.
2,This shouldn't be categorized as a comedy.,This shouldn't be categorized as a comedy. It is too dark. Maybe a dramedy? It seems the trailers are becoming more and more deceiving and you can't be certain what you will be watching. I thought the acting was fine but the content was not uplifting. I like to laugh or at least be amused when I see a comedy not depressed afterwards.
4,Strange Love Story,"I wasn't expecting a love story when we rented this movie, but it was very sweet. Not an overwhelming tear wrenching love story, but it was cute."
5,Typical Steve Carell,"Great movie,I cry every time I watch it much to my husbands amazement. This movie was classified as a comedy which of course with Carell you do get his low key humor which I love,but over all this is NOT a comedy and I think that's why some people didn't like it because they were expecting a different ending.Guess they had a hard time knowing how to classify the movie which I can understand.Anyway watch it you won't regret it."
3,A fine movie,"I expected this movie to be more funny, but it's actually more serious. It was a nice exploration of the character's quest to find fulfillment in life."
3,Average,"The movie is worth the rental if the price is discounted. The movie cast is strong, but the storyline is meh."
2,strange movie,Expected more with Steve Carell in it. Watching it once was enough for me. Sorry I did not wait for it to be free.
4,It was ok,"it was entertaining, that's it, thought it would be more interesting or fun but overall it was a good movie"
3,Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World,"I liked the movie, I didn't love it. I watched mainlybecause I am a Kiera Knightley fan. I wouldn't buy itbut it was worth watching."
1,Seeking a Friend for the End of the World?,I didn't like it. I'm surprised that they [the producers] were able to get as many credable actors as they did. The plot was non-existant. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with more than 1/2 a brain cell.
3,It was just ok,"I like Steve Carell, so I thought I'd give this a try. It was alright. Nothing amazing, but I have seen much worse movies."
1,Huh?,"Clever? Heartwarming? Positive? Excellent acting, love the actors, but this is one of the bleakest, most depressing movies I've ever seen. Humans with no hope, at their worst. If you think it gets better at the end, it doesn't."
3,A perfectly 3 star movie,"This movie is a 3. Exactly a 3. That's how I'll describe it. It's not shitty, it's not amazing, it's a solid 3 stars out of 5."
4,great but sad ending,This movie was very entertaining. Steve is always great. My only complaint was that the ending was sad and left me wishing it had ended differently (but that's personal preference).
2,Not a Great Comedy or Drama,"I heard great things about this movie, but was disappointed that it didn't deliver on the comedy or drama aspects of it. Kiera Knightley is not a good actor and in this movie it looked like she was trying too hard on the comedy bits and it resulted in some over-the-top acting moments. Steve Carrel plays his usual self. I didn't buy the romantic angle of it, and so the ending wasn't as heartfelt and affective for me as it should have been. The movie just didn't deliver on any level."
3,You Need to be in the Mood to Watch This,An enjoyable movie but don't watch if you are looking for an uplifting movie. I was left waiting for the uplifting moment.
3,Interesting,It was an interesting premise and exploring how people react made one start contemplating how you would react. Some tried to keep on day to day activities and others stuck out or fell into dismay. Interesting movie.
4,Rare honest performances,"I really enjoyed the ""naked"" performances - real emotion and a no-nonsense style. The actors performances felt true. I would recommend it."
2,Not very funny.,"Wife and I like to watch comedies, and this movie is more sap love story than funny. There are some funny parts but the overall tone is somber. Steve is great as usual but the chemistry is not right with KN as the pair seem too apart in age for the premise of the movie.Best parts were seeing what people do when they know the end of the world is coming."
3,"NOT Funny - Seriously, NOT funny","Ok, so I knew this was about the end of the world but the previews make it look really cute. Yes, there are some rather cute/funny parts but HOLY SHIT was this depressing. Thus, it receives 3 stars because although the acting is phenomenal I wanted to laugh and instead I am weeping. Thanks a lot !!!"
3,Worth the rental fee,"Surprisingly touching, a good movie with some clunky parts here and there. Overall worth the time, but I'd cut a few scenes out and re-write the last forty minutes."
5,"a brilliant and compelling exploration in human character, and inhuman circumstance...","if you're looking for a page-turning, plot-driven narrative this is not your novel... but if you're ready to embark on a journey of exploration in human character, filtered through the lens of recent cultural and political history, this is a beautiful and amazing work that you must read... Giraffe allows the reader to experience the ""communist moment"" through first-person narrative in an engaging array of fascinating human and even inhuman characters... their voices ring true in the same resonant manner as the physical and historic minutiae surrounding the soviet-era Czechoslovakia throughout this tremendous work which transports the reader to another time and place, and as the best literature can, to another being and perspective altogether... a brilliant novel, based on compelling, haunting, and tragic actual events, these characters will stay with you, and your world-view will expand."
2,A Disappointing Read,"I wanted to like this book, but came away disappointed. The premise is very interesting and much of the prose is very good as well. However, there is an emptiness that sets in roughly 2/3 of the way through the novel that never really leaves a reader."
3,Great Hero but....,"Although Ms Hunter is an auto buy I found this latest book from her to be a bit of disappointment. The heorine is of the sort who whines thru the whole book over an incident that appears in their shared past. An incident she was willingly party to. She seems to want to blame the hero for the whole thing and it is clear to this reader she needed to get over it and move on. Here was a man who adored her, she needed to take the chance; she deserved him and he her. She does eventually get over it but not soon enough for my total enjoyment of the book. This hero however was a delight, the best reason to by this book. Great comic relief, rivals some of today's best commedic contemporary romance authors, ie... SEP. It is hoped that Ms Hunter will return to the style of her earlier works where her heroines were strong. providing a wonderful compliment to their heroes. Although not my favorite of Ms Hunter's body of work, I would reccomend it for the excellent characterization of a hero."
4,A Great Book for a Lot Less,"The Pentateuch is a well-written and insightful introduction that is used at the college level but will appeal to any reader who wants to learn more about the first 5 books of Moses. I own a number of introductions and titles on the Pentateuch, but return to this little gem quite often for its clear, practical approach and overall helpfulness. Just so you know, these and other great titles from Dr. Holdcroft are available directly from the publisher at ceeteconline.com at a fraction of the prices listed by individual resellers. So save your money and happy reading!"
2,Marmeduke,"While there is much about this movie that is bad, there are some good points, which is where this review will begin. This movie is clean and family-friendly. There are no situations where little kids will be confused or scared. It is mild enough so parents can let their kids watch it unsupervised.Now for the bad points. THis movie is terrible. It is based on a comic strip that has no plot, thus the movie has a limited plot. I thought maybe at first it would be similar to the ""Beethoven"" movies from a few years back. But it wasn't even close to Beethoven. Then I thought it would resemble some of the other dog movies, but it didn't. This movie was pathetic and I recommend it to no one."
4,good morals with humor,I was surprised at how critical some reviewed Marmaduke..I thought it had some really good morals to teach children with some cute humor as well. 4 stars from me.
2,Another Kid Romance,"My son enjoyed this movie (8), it was doing okay with me until the female dogs entered the scene. I hate children movies that try to incorporate adult themes in the scheme. Marmaduke is attracted to one female while his female friend is attracted to him.Can kids just be kids and not so concerned about relationships yet? They'll get plenty of that as teenagers."
5,AutoXray 1500 CodeScout,"This thing works like a charm. My $80 1998 Civic repair manual has all of the error codes right in the manual, so I didn't even have to hunt them down.The first time I used this, it paid for itself."
4,Worked well,It worked as advertised and am very happy with it. A little disappointed that it claimes you can update the firmware on the internet but doesn't mention you need to purchase a special USB cable and software ($30) to make that happen. But overall happy.
4,Works great,"Chosen for cost and features. The few times I have used it, it works fine and as advertised. I would recommend it for casual mechanics or owners who are curious about the engine codes behind the ""check engine"" light."
3,DVD,Service great price great would not give anyone for this movie but service was awesome love working with them will do it again
1,Caustic smelling,"I bought this one last week, when it arrived and I saw it was a Doc Johnson item I started to be afraid (my bad I didn't realize it was). I was right, it smells as a previous Doc Johnson toy I bought last year and my wife always refused to use because of its smell. So far only our UR3 material Doc Johnson toys doesn't smell like that.One year later, the old one keeps stinking. I tried washing it, with talcum powder, nothing worked!!With such a disappointing odor it doesn't look safe for its purpose.Stay away of this item."
5,What a fun ride!,"If you enjoy either Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books OR witty social satire, you'll enjoy this book! Looking forward to Jennifer Colt's next one!!"
5,Such an eye opener,"This book changed my life. It opened my eyes to see the many different manifestations of anger within me. I've been through psychology classes but nothing details the emotion of anger like this book. It's a meaty book but the best part (at least for me) is towards the end. It details the different levels of anger such as wrath and rage...it helps you understand what people are going through, especially with all these mass shootings. It gives warning signs of the different levels of anger one may unknowingly enter into. There's so much info (quality info) in this book, I encourage anyone and everyone to get this book for one simple reason... we all have anger, so this book applies to EVERYONE!!!"
4,Not too bad,It was pretty good and had some good acting in it. The story line was decent and there was enough blood and creepiness in it to make it worth buying.
2,FREAK DOG,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEWKevin is a creepy morgue attendant and outcast who is shy and stutters. He has made a video of med students appropriating some party pharmaceuticals. They invite him to drink and party with him under the guise that if he participates, he won't tell. Turns out Kevin is a bit epileptic and ends up in a coma as the kids dump him off at the hospital and run.Catherine (Arielle Kebbel) the girl Kevin had a crush on feels guilty and attempts to revive him with an experimental drug...one that stimulates the brain which happens to be the part of the brain which gives people out of body experiences. Soon people in the cliche are brutally murdered.Okay, the killer is a guy in a coma. He apparently enters people's brains, takes control and has them kill for him. It was a bit of a yawner. For some reason the film lacked intensity.F-bombs, brief sex?, brief corpse nudity, Arielle Kebbel,Sarah Boyd-Wilson bra/panties"
2,Blah,"Just finished watching ""Red Mist"", and frankly i got a bit bored after the 2nd killing.After that it just gets predictable.This is yet again another so-called ""horror"" movie that involves vengence on a group of friends that kill some random loser they all make fun of by accident and blablabla, we ALL know where this is going and it leaves nothing to the imagination of what could happen next.This is not worth a second watching.It had potential in the beginning but after that it went flat.I would've loved if it had some back story on why the killer self-mutilated and why he was the way he was, but all it showed from that is his mother being a hooker and him witnessing abuse for like 2 minutes of the whole film and that's it.I was really looking forward to liking this movie and adding it to my collection, but i'll just have to pass on this one."
3,back pack,My son loves Sponge Bob. This was a nice addition to his collection. The backpack is big. It is kinda awkward for a 3 yr old to pull around. I think it will be better when he gets older. It does not go on his back very well and is uncomfortable. The handle is hard to push down. But it is large and you can put lots of stuff in it to take on a trip plus he loves sponge bob so it was worth the money.
2,Didn't work as advertised,"The good: Good image quality in many lighting conditions. Wireless worked well with WEP.The bad: Email on motion detection sends one email then locks up till power reset. DDNS setup did not work, just gave error messages. I had to set up my own, which is not so hard but I wasted a lot of time trying to make it work. The camera viewer program does not record on motion as advertised. Phone tech support is useless and email support is slow and unhelpful and now they seem to have given up on me.If they come through I'll revise my opinion but for now I cannot recomend this product for anything but real time web viewing. The motion detection does not seem to work as advertised"
2,Utterly tasteless,"I have come to trust my fellow Amazon reviewers. That was why I bought this tea. To me, it was tasteless. Granted, I like things with flavor, but I can also appreciate subtlety. This was so subtle it was like clothes on the Emperor.Naturally, we are all different and like different things. If you are partial to very mild, super gentle flavors, this tea is for you; if not, I suggest the silver needle white tea with jasmine by Rishi or Celestial Seasons' decaf white."
4,"tea is good, something else is wrong....","I purchased this item from Amazon and expected 6 boxes of 20 bags. I got one box of 20 bags. I complained. When the man I spoke to said they would just send it again, I was thinking that they would send me 5 boxes, but they sent me 1 box in the second order. I guess this is just one box of 20 tea bags for the price. I do really like the tea though. It makes excellent iced tea and hot tea. So if you want 1 box for the price, puchase this item."
3,Average to poor read,"I have to agree with several of the previous reviewers who fault this book for being ""light"" on the information. I consider myself average in wardrobe knowledge and I really didn't learn anything new. It wasn't even presented in a particularly insightful manner. Some info was a good reminder, however, but plain stuff, like buying the right type of hangers for your closet.I didn't appreciate their references to ""this designer"" or ""that designer"" when describing looks, because I'm not that familiar with them, and I would guess a large percentage of the American public is in the same boat. They also could use some pictures!! I know it puts the price of the book up, but BOY could they use some pictures (this bears repeating)!!Save your money or look at this one in a bookstore because it's so short you could read it while standing in the aisles!"
5,Wonderful movie!,"This movie shows you much that we do not know about the founding of our great nation, the USA! So many lives were lost and all for freedom to express and live out their faith. What is happening now in our nation?! We must remember the price paid for our religious freedoms and fight to keep them. Very informational and so well done."
3,Good information,"This is a good, well documented presentation of our US history and the values that our country is based on. However, the practical value is missing. After watching and agreeing with most everything in it, I came away with the question, ""So what?"" What can I do to change the direction our country is headed? The majority in our country are either ignorant or opposed to these values and we are headed away from them at increasing speed, unfortunately."
5,Good documentary,"Whether you like Kirk Cameron or not (I do), you have to respect the historical value of this movie. I learned a lot about the Pilgrims that I never knew. I grew up near Plymouth, MA and never knew that the ""Monument to our Forefathers"" existed. A cool piece of American history tucked away in a residential Plymouth neighborhood.I found this movie very valuable to watch and very educational. Of course, being Kirk Cameron, it has a Christian emphasis. Even if you are not a Christian I think you could still enjoy it from a historical standpoint."
5,Amazing,What a great presentation of that history. It is unbeleivable how much history that we are finding that is covered up by our liberal educators. A movie I can actually watch with my 6 yo daughter.Thanks Rick KS
1,"Propaganda! Mislead one-sided theory to abuse facts! and just as a movie, crap!",Crap! Lies! Blind faith! Misleading! Bad acting and movie making! Open your eyes and minds! Question everything! Think for yourself! This is what was wrong with W. Bush!
5,Monumental,I found this film comforting and educational. I was not aware of the content of this film and I thought I knew my history.
2,Kind of a joke,"My fault for measuring the cabinet depth instead of the shelf depth, but this thing protrudes over half an inch beyond the shelf. I can live with that. What's really annoying is how misleading the product appears. You will never be able to use more than four hooks, and it would just be easier to use if it only had two hooks on each side. Only giving this an extra star because it's cheap and at least gets four of my teacups out of the way."
4,Installation problem,"The software for the Belkin GPS unit is not compatible with Windows PC 2003 second edition. To load you must turn the screen on your PDA into Landscape mode, then generate and install your map. After it is loaded into PDA, you can turn screen into portrait mode and it will work. Belkin said they havn't updated their software yet and don't know when they will."
1,Foam liquifies! and dispenser is not kid-friendly,"I bought a six-pack of this soap and every single bottle liquifies over time and does not foam. Also, the dispenser is really tough for my 3-year old son to use. It requires two hands for him to push it down. Not kid-friendly at all."
4,Daughter loves it!,"Purchased for 10 year old girl, Harry Potter crazy. She really enjoys playing it with her Dad. I was afraid of compatibility with my older DVD player but it works great. Muggle category too difficult for her, but if not for it she would know all the answers and it would not be fun.Recommend."
1,"If it breaks, it's your fault!","I was very disappointed in Nikon's service. This camera has a 2in LCD display that apparently is very fragile. When I returned for service, Nikon claimed I dropped it... which I didn't! I was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile LCD still broke. To be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing. They offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.I will NEVER by a Nikon product again. If they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it."
2,Frustrated owner needing service,"I love my Nikon Coolpix 5900 however, the lens failed in less than one year. Service took 6 weeks to repair. The lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair. Why is the lens failing to open again? I absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although I do have a paid plan for it. Why can't warranty be fast, local and competent?"
4,beautiful color,"The pink color is very nice. The pearl is quite big and the chain is kinda big too. It should be beautiful but somehow it looks slightly out of place with just about everything I tried....It doesn't look like dress jewlery, but then it doesn't look that well with casual attire either...I tend to think it is because of the chain. Anyways, it looks beautiful by itself!"
4,Quite a surprisingly good album,"When stations here in Boston began (for a very short while) playing ""Say What You Want,"" I thought it was from one of those typical young black female R&B singers who goes by their first name and would soon fade into the musical background. I ventured out to buy the CD, only to be hideously surprised that it was a Scottish band fronted by a very white woman. The lead vocals have great emotion and inflection, and the music can be quite seductive at times. The little musical interludes are quite vexing, but the album as a whole is very good. ""Black Eyed Boy"", while an obvious generic Motown cover, is great for blasting the stereo and dancing with attitude. ""Say What You Want"" is an incredibly jazzy, silky smooth song that almost forces you to bob your head and point your fingers. The rest of the collection of songs are quite good...not excellent...but definitely worthy of a listen or two."
4,Pop Class,"Texas are somewhat of a phenomenon in the UK & Europe, with over 8 million sales of their last 2 albums alone, and a 12 year run in the music iindustry. Best known for singing the theme tune of Ellen in America (based on their song So Called Friend) Sharleen Spiteri & band let rip on this classic album containing the achingly gorgeous Put Your Arms Around Me, the infectiously catchy Balck-Eyed Boy & Halo as well as the cool & mesemrising hits INsane & Say What You Want. Having seen this Scottish band live! and grew up as they have, I am truly amazed at the versatility of this band and the sheer magnitude of their performance abilites. Definitely not an album to be missed - your record collection is incomplete without."
3,"very ""used""","The book is out of print and old, so I expected some wear and tear, but it looked like the edges were eaten by mice and the book cover fell apart."
3,On the right track,"As Pythagoras once said, ""all truth may be found in numbers,"" there is much knowledge in sacred geometry. Here, Drunvalo has much to offer. Personally, I don't understand a walk in from the 13th dimension. I couldn't bet my life on knowing what the 6th through 12th were about. But the Flower of Life is a self explanatory symbol for global transformation. The next step beyond Drunvalo is a book called LightShift 2000: Let's Turn on the Light of the World. Here it maps out a formula of visionary activism for personal and global upliftment which is happening all over the world. Check it out. I liked this book, but I would give more credibility to the material if the source was showed more humility and mortality."
2,flower of life,"they should really have this book in public libraries, so nobody has to spend money to read it. in it, melchizekdek proposes a geometric/mathematical model for radical abstract consciousness theories and a new age history of the world. mostly, it's rumors he's overhead, i dunno, outside a freemason cocktail party or something. it's not very well-written, which is good, since if you read it closely you can see how information can be manipulated to fit any argument. does sacred geometry exist? yes. do space aliens? maybe. portholes to other dimensions? if there were, i imagine there would be a starbucks coffeehouse at each end. walt whitman traversed more universes than this guy can shake a stick at. if you read this book, and believe everything in it, you're probably paranoid. get out more, and read better books."
1,Total Nonsense,Complete dribble written by a professional conman. It's hard to believe anyone in the this day and age could take this nonsense seriously. A rip off for the gullible masses.
4,"Very good, but not their best","The band's major-label debut (they've since bought their song rights back, but that's another story) contains mostly very good tracks, but the band was in a transition period when they recorded it, and it shows in the album as a whole. The band had one foot firmly planted in the prog-rock-oriented music of their first two albums, but were headed toward the much more mainstream sound of _Painted pictures_. As a result of this--and because the lead guitarist and drummer were new for this album--the songs bounce back and forth a bit erratically between styles. By the time GEG recorded _A little voodoo_ (their most recent album at this date) they'd managed to reconcile these two directions much better. Summary: If you like the sound of a band in transition go for _Eventide_, but if you're after a band that's come to terms with itself, get _A little voodoo_ instead."
2,Would be good ....,Well i liked the brush for the 2 months that ive used it. I just wish it had a smaller brush on the bottom. Which you'd think it would being that the Dr browns bottles have all the nooks and cranny's.My biggest problem is that like i said Ive had this brush for about 2 months and used it under normal circumstances. And it broke at the base of the handle where the wiring connects to the plastic. So i am very disappointed to say the least. This is one of the pricier Bottle brushes and I think it should last longer then 2 months.
2,Not so hot,"While the brush initially did a good job cleaning the bottles, the metal shaft that attaches the sponge to the handle rusted within a couple of weeks. It is a poor design (a baby product that is designed to use wet should not rust). I would not purchase again!"
3,"A little stiff, and suction cup wasn't useful",We bought this to hand wash bottles when we can't run them through a washer. We bought a cheaper spare from CVS that has softer bristles and cleans better.
2,Not really worth it,I bought this thinking it would clean the Dr Brown bottles & nipples better than the one I got fr/ the super market... not so. You can totally skip it.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was interested in this bottle brush because I had been very pleased with all Dr. Brown's products and it advertised a suction cup base that can hook into the neck of the brush so I could attach it to the wall of the sink. Well, when it arrived I was puzzled since the brush did not match the picture of the product on Amazon. The neck is much shorter and is lacking the 1 inch section of just the white coated wire where the suction cup attaches (between the bristles and the handle). My brush goes from bristles directly to the handle; there is no space in between. I was very disappointed, and so I just keep it standing upright on the counter - as pictured."
3,Great brush for a few months,"I bought this brush because I'm a big fan of the Dr. Brown bottles. I think this brush cleans the bottles very effectively until it starts to show wear and tear after a few months. In all honesty, this brush lasted for about 8 months for me, but we did not use it daily to clean bottles, as most of the time we run the bottles through the dishwasher. The sponge started to break down, which is not a big deal as sponges don't last too long, but the wire stem was pretty flimsy out of the box and just broke today."
3,"Works okay, but doesn't last","I put this on my registry and received it as a gift. The brush works fine on the Dr. Brown bottles as well as my Medela pump bottles. Pro: The bristles are soft and flexible. Con: We've had it for 2 months now and the sponge is already falling apart. We already need to replace it with another. But for $4, not bad."
2,Lasted me 1 month,I used this brush with my Dr. Brown's bottles and it lasted me about a month. The sponge at the tip got loose and before I knew it the whole thing came apart.Not very durable.
2,Only good part is the extra,"Hard to understand how one can take a beautiful location and ruin it with poor photography. The color is all a greenish-yellow and looks awful. The only thing worth watching is the extra which probably was recorded with a low cost HD camcorder and looks much better than the feature. It has natural color, good skin tone and even most of the people in the film look better on the short extra. McConnaughey acts like a stoned idiot in the freature, but has charm and class in the extra. Whoever did the extra should have been responsible for the entire film."
4,Easy going movie - Digital Copy Windows only,I just wanted to have everyone know that the Digital Copy is not Mac OSX compatible. It is a pure Windows Digital Copy in this set. (I would give this set zero stars if I wouldn't like the movie based on the DIgital Copy limitation)The Movie itself is a nice easy going and relaxing movie.
1,Surf Dud,"I love Matthew McConaughey, but talk about a stupid terrible movie. I think Matthew will win the Razzie for sure on this one! What was he thinking...apparantly not thinking at all!"
4,"Stupid, but lots of skin","I was happy from beginning to end while watching this movie a) because Matthew was shirtless pretty much all of the time, b) everyone was smoking pot, c) Willie Nelson was in it as a goat farmer (that's awesome!), d) the music is great, & e) Matthew actually does surf a bit & he looks quite fine doing it! I think this movie was made for women like me who basically just want to imagine life with a guy like Add. :-D"
3,Looks the same as last year's calendar....,This calendar is awfully similar to the calendars of recent years. Do they just pull out stuff from previous years and insert them in and think we won't recognize the same material being rehashed....I was a little disappointed...
2,Disappointed,"I've read other books by Elizabeth Lowell and liked them. This one was a real disappointment. The hero was unlikeable; there was no chemistry between the hero & heroine. And some phrases were repeated over and over, ad nauseum. I expect more from a ""professional"" author."
5,My son LOVES this Spidey.,"Great toy. My son loves it. He has one when they originally came out years ago and it was his favorite, now it has wear and tear so I looked for another and I found this one. Great Price, great seller. I am very happy!"
2,SEEMS LIKE MATTEL HAS RUN OUT OF IDEAS...,"It seems that with each new Asian doll released in this series, Mattel puts forth less and less effort. I found nothing exceptional about the Korean doll - the costume seemed a bit skimpy and she did not even look particularly Korean in her facial features. Standing next to the Chinese and Japanese princesses, Korea looks nothing more than... AVERAGE."
4,Korean Barbie,Met the requirements for a Korean doll. It was fairly expensive and I could have had a 50% savings through e-bay.
3,"A ""Missing Links"" Sequel that's missing...","Shanks for Nothing follows the author's fantastic comedy ""The Missing Links."" While Missing Links was terrific, this book was a tired sequel. Material felt ""warmed over"" from the prior book. The story was amusing in many parts and moved along nicely. I also found it a little far fetched in some areas (sneaking on plane by distracting board gate attendant). If you are a golfer and looking to kill a few hours and don't want to stretch your mind and get a few kicks, this book is for you."
3,Coolpix 7600,Great pictures but it is a battery killer. Eats batteries up like there is no tomorrow. Did not use the video feature because of this problem.
1,blur factory,"This camera's auto focus needs improvement. 30% of the pictures were blurry. There are too many options to pick from to get a good picture. If you are not completely still when you take a picture, you will get a blurry picture. Color distortion is a regular occurence. I thought the name Nikon stood for something but this camera proves me wrong. Not recommended."
2,Iguanas,This book was very helpful in learning about the do's and don'ts of having a pet iguana. The information was very clearly presented. I recommend this book to new iguana owners.
2,Disappointed,With all the advertising that it is the answer to low water pressure I was very disappointed. It only sputtered out a weak stream of water that sort of fell through the air. It did not live up to its advertising. It does seem to be very solid and it looks nice but it did not help with the low pressure shower.
4,Finding bands like this reminds me why I love music...,"Cravin Melon has a deep, soulful sound with rich vocals that is completely consuming. A cross between Paw and John Hiatt (and perhaps the Screamin Cheetah Wheelies, if anyone knows of them), Cravin Melon combines lush melodies with southern, country-tinged appeal. Album Red Clay Harvest opens with wistful rocker ""Come Undone"" and moves through rhythmic subtle grooves with class. Longing, not-really-ballads ""Hey Sister"" and ""Can't Find My Way"" are sweetly melodic with thick, complimentary guitar work; strong rock tuned like ""Pretend"" and ""Nobody's Proze"" utilize heavy percussive elements to round out their sound. Vocals are heartfelt and sonorous, moving over songs and colored with light harmonization during choruses. Cravin Melon is one of those bands who just feels right -each song on this album offers a perfect picture of soulful rock and roll."
5,excellent transaction,"excellent transaction, very good graphic, beautiful picture-not faded of fuzzy, good fit, perfect shade of blue, comfortable material--not thin or clingy, due to special sparkel material on moon portion of tee--do not suggest using a dryer (shirt may stick to itself)--hanger dry. This is my favorite tee!"
4,still with us...,"although it's hard to rate such a CD, i would say it's a nice piece to have for people who like and respect Tim. i always enjoy playing some of his CDs or videos just to listen to him, and especially the way he was talking about things... just sit back, and enjoy."
3,I guess?,"I ordered this not knowing that you need a second wrench to hold the other side. Maybe I was supposed to know that going in, but I wasn't going to wait another week while the parts came in... ended up taking my Bimmer to the shop to get the thermostat replaced."
4,fox,i personally did not like this movie but my grandkids love go figure they love the fact that we can rent movies on demand through amazon where there wish list is for christmas lol
2,Why bother have the characters as animals?,"We were looking forward to seeing this film with our kids, but just couldn't like it. Our dislike of the movie doesn't come through an inability to enjoy Wes Anderson, as we have seen and enjoyed ""Rushmore"", ""The Life Aquatic"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", and ""The Squid and the Whale"".I couldn't help thinking what a dull movie it would be if one just replaced the animal heads with human heads. To us as diehard Dahl fans, the movie failed to capture the spirit of the book... it winked at the adults too much and really did not speak to children. The main characters were prettified and yet charmless. The dialogue... meh. It was kind of a generic rom-com but because the characters are animals, it must be for kids, right?As a children's movie, may compare with Pixar, but really not in the league of Aardman Animations or Miyazaki. But then again, what is?"
3,"Great voices, mediocre film","To me the voices made this movie. George Clooney and Meryl Streep did a fantastic job. I did not like the story much, because it seemed repetitious and boring. The stop-motion animation was done before and better by Nick Park. Watch it once if you have nothing better."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"The first half of the movie had potential, but it just falls apart into sillyness at the end, and 'suspending your disbelief' becomes impossible, after which the movie sadly falls off a cliff. This was definitely not a kids movie because both the language and themes where adult oriented, and it is to 'over the top' silly (especially the end) for adults, so what demographic where the producers of this movie targeting, who knows? The story-line was pointless, and plot just silly-stupid. I couldn't wait for the movie to end -- and when it was over, I was left thinking, ""I wish I could have the last 2hrs of my life back"".If you must see it rent it, DON'T BUY IT; if you do the DVD will be a $15 coaster after you're done watching."
3,Stop motion animation....good but not great,"So you take big stars for the voice over but then they use crappy stop motion techniques for the animation. What you end up with is a product that is goodbut could have been better.What bothers me is that they still charge you a arm and a leg anyway.Good movie, rent it ...and if you like it buy it second hand...so you wont feelripped off.The story is good but not too complex. Its like watching one of those familyepisodes on TV where they deal with different issues...but done with animals insteadof humans."
3,FOX ON THE RUN,"Cleverly crafted with some innovative images, FANTASTIC MR. FOX is certainly an original ""animated"" film. But it seemed dull at times and ""preachy"" at others.George Clooney was too much Clooney and Mr. Fox seemed an extension of his superstar persona rather than a real character. Similarly, Meryl Streep's Mrs. Fox is bland and considering her undeniable talent, she's rather disappointing. Wes Anderson's directing skills are evident, but the whole effect IMO is flat and not entirely satisfying."
3,mr fox review,I did not care for the movie but my kids and my dad loved it.there was way to much talking for me and its a cartoon at that.But like I say thats just me.
5,What the cuss!!,"One of my all time favorite films, if you're tired of those computer generated films then this good ol' fashioned stop motion animation will get you laughing throughout the whole movie. This film is more directed to an adult audience, but some children may like it if the understand dry humor."
4,Fantastic mr fox,"Great movie, I recieved it very timely and in good shape just as was described to me. I am very happy"
1,Bad to the Bone,"This movie was bad, boring and highly unentertaining. I bought two DVD's, one for myself and one for my grandson. I took the unopenned one back, wish I could have returned both."
5,This film blew me away.,"When I saw the trailer for Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was unimpressed, but I am a huge Wes Anderson fan, so I decided to give it a shot.Wow! I am SO glad I did. This film was such a refreshing change for me--it embraces its storybook roots with simple, puppet-show style sets and animation, instead of basically apologizing for the fact that it's animated by using CGI to easily create the smoothest movement possible.I usually don't laugh much at movies, but this one had me in tears. True, if you prefer less subtle humor, you may not like it, but in my opinion, this is Anderson's greatest film so far--and maybe my new favorite movie."
2,A disappointing read,"This is the first Brenda Joyce novel I have read and I will probably not read another. I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Elizabeth Lowell, Jayne Ann Krentz and Catherine Coulter so obviously enjoy books of this genre. I was looking forward to a new discovery (for me) but I found Claire, the protagonist, to be extremely annoying and thoroughly unlikeable and kept hoping that Ian Marshall would be successfull in his attempts to get rid of her. Their relationship felt contrived and implausible. Definitely not a book I would recommend."
1,This pills make my urine ultra-yellow!,"My wife bought those and I started to take tablets every few days.I think I was sick, because my urine (and I'm sorry to say that, but this is what it is), turned to be ultra-yellow.It made me immediately think that I'm sick with fever or some sort of kidney disease.After I realized that I'm not really sick, I identified tablets as culprit of this ""issue"".I'd rather have vitamins, which don't have such strange affect on me."
4,Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies,"I love gingerbread and ginger cookies, and Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies are the best tasting ginger cookies I've found. When they are fresh they have a nice chewy texture and just the right bite of crystallized ginger. I spread them with peanut butter for a fast breakfast or quick snack: the flavors meld perfectly. My only quibble: they are rather pricey, and if they are not at their peak of freshness, they get hard, dry and brittle, though you can revive them somewhat by dunking them in milk or tea. In the store, you can tell the state of freshness by lightly pressing your thumb on the sample cookie through the cellophane. The cookie will yield slightly if it is fresh. If it doesn't yield at all, the cookies are stale: don't buy the box. I would give these cookies 5 stars if they were always sold fresh."
3,buy this for the cable,"My purpose in this purchase was a inexpensive way to obtain the cable. The very same cable is sold at national electronics stores for as much as $19.95, Forget the included CD of a somewhat obsolete MOT phone tools version. Sure, after updating on the web to a later v.4 [but NOT to the current v. 5] it will allow you to save a lot of laborious key stroking to enter phone numbers into the SIM or the memory. But, that's about the limit of the usefullnes."
1,no good for VERIZON customers!,"Verizon customers will be unable to use the multimedia portion of this software (ie, no ringtones, pics etc transferable from PC to phone) because Verizon blocks this feature. Phonebook etc work fine. Verizon wants you to pay for their VCast service so they ask Motorola to block the Multimedia feature on this software. In my case, I have a RAZR V3m and it can't establish a connection if i try to put ringtones on my phone. I wish they would have specified this so I would have known before I got the product since that was my main reason."
3,"the technlogy's there, but ...","This was a package that should have worked, but didn't seem to function when I tried to connect to my phone. It wasn't until later that I discovered that the cable was faulty (I had another cable from a digital camera I could try). Then I found out the software needed updating, but that's a minor issue. Even later, I found that the cable I purchased would work as long as I kept pressure on the contacts in the phone; I'm more worried about damaging my phone than I am about making this cable work, so I'm thinking about getting a bluetooth adapter for my computer. More expense, just to make this purchase worthwhile.All in all, I'd say the technology works, and does what I wanted, but the individual product shipped was faulty."
5,Good product,This is a cool program. Saves on downloading ringtones and wallpapers plus other really cool stuff.
4,TOP FLIGHT,"Excellent value for price. This is my second.after losing the first that was still going strong after a year and a half.Is good for being seen in city driving but insufficiently bright for riding in near darkness. Very light,secure and easy mounting (and removal) but would think rubber strap would eventually wear out."
4,Intelligent Humor,"""Love Conquers All"" was an early reminder of the genius that was to come from the pen of Robert Benchley. At the advice of a numerologist Benchley would drop the middle initial from his byline on the promise of future success. No matter how you feel about numerology it was clear that Benchley did not need any added luck or karma. Admirers agree that he blazed an individual trail of intelligence in the fields of criticism and humor. Robert Benchley needs to have a renaissance. The exhibition of his movie shorts on Turner Classic Movies lately is a good step in that direction."
4,Fast read.,I got into to this book right away and enjoyed it a lot. I always look forward to the next one. It's nice to fine a author you know will give you a great read.
4,Very Good,"I am opening my literary world to new authors and Deborah Crombie is among the newbie number. Although, I have not read any of Ms. Crombie's work before it is very reminiscent of the game of Clue and early Sherlock Holmes novels. The potential villain lurking among the innocent is a classic suspense novel tactic. However, Ms. Crombie took this tactic and spun it much to her advantage weaving a titillating tale and a trail of clues for the reader to follow.Horror in the hot tub: Sebastian is electrocuted while taking a relaxing dip.Cruelty on the court: Penny is bludgeoned to death with an old tennis racquet.Scare on the stair: Hannah is shoved down the stairs by a malevolent hand.This book is heavy laden with subterfuge among its interesting blend of characters.Even with all the clues, I never guessed who the villain was. This was a very well-crafted and well-paced story."
1,Who is proof-reading your material?,"This good book was ruined for me by the atrocious editing of the manuscript. For example, at one point the word ""tell"", part of the infinitive ""to tell"", was written as ""Cell"" ( AND continued on the next line!). For no apparent reason, the text would switch to italics for a phrase or two. Incredible! I won't mention the many other errors.I have been an Amazon customer for almost twenty years and have spent hundreds of dollars here. I LOVE shopping at Amazon so this experience has made me sad--truly!Muriel Johnstonchagres@verizon.net"
2,DON'T LET ITALY FOOL YOU!,"Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel are excellent here as writers who become, against convention and of course against logic, lovers. Of course both characters, the writer George Sand and the poet Alfred de Musset, are neither conventional nor logical people. Unfortunately the story is not very engaging; if one knows nothing about Sand or Musset, it might not even make a lot of sense. All I can say here is that they let Italy fool them, which Italy will do every time. Stories in which people run off, thinking travel and new scenery will cure them of all their ills and relationship problems are mundane and always lead in the same direction-disaster. In this film, it becomes melodramatic when Sand and Musset travel around Europe (rather scandalously); Musset is a madman, and Italy just makes everything worse!"
5,go directly to track 19,"If you enjoy music that includes the best musical drama of the cello, track 19 on this soundtrack is outstanding! Buy this CD and love it. If this arrangement had not been for movie soundtrack but more like a stand alone composition, it would get airplay on classical stations. It's that good."
4,Boys Can Write Good Poems Too!,"Locomotion is a poem book about a little boy named Lonnie who is 11 years old. His parents died in a fire and he and his sister are now living in two different homes. Lonnie is with Mrs. Edna and Lilly's with ""her new momma"", as Lonnie calls her. Lilly is only 8 years old. Lonnie writes the poems in a poem journal he got from his teacher. You would like this book if you like different styles of poetry and if you like good books!I give this book 4 stars. I had a few questions while reading it. Why is the book called Locomotion? What smoke? Why is he staying at Mrs. Edna's house? How old is Lonnie? All of my questions were answered. Three things I liked best were: the poetry, how I could relate to the character a little, and the realistic setting the book had. You should definitely read this book!"
3,I GUESS THIS IS A GOOD BOOK,Locomotion is a story about a kid that wrote a book in poetry-form. He talks about stories of his mom and his family. This is a sad story. Some of the stories talk about his friend or classmate that is disabled. I liked this story because it's written in poetry-form and that he talks about a lot of poems in this story. I think that you should read this book if you like poems.But it doesnt have so much action.
3,"Historical fraud and pornography, by Mark Twain","While practicing the writing style to be used in ""The Prince and the Pauper"", Twain had some fun creating this little tale of an evening of converation in 1601 when Queen Elizabeth plays host to some luminaries of the era (Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh, etc.). The text consists of notes made from the point of view of a disgusted servant. This is vulgar humor (Twain wrote in his autobiography, ""...if there is a decent word findable in it, it is because I overlooked it"") and it will not appeal to all tastes, but Mark Twain buffs may appreciate seeing an unusual side of Twain, and it's said that Twain would pick up the text and laugh at it with close friends. I have heard that this fictional story was taken seriously by some people and thus is the source of some odd rumors about Queen Elizabeth et al. The actual story is extremely short, so I don't know how they filled a book with it"
2,Phone Battery,I had the 1 battery that came with the phone that lasted over a year. I brought this one that is a compatable and its no good I have to go buy another new one it only lasted a few weeks
1,No warranty !,"I can't rate this product yet because it doesn't work. It comes with no manufacturer warranty! I run an IT department and can't get it to work. I called HP and they confirmed it was a software problem but that I would have to purchase 45 minutes of ""Help time"" for $69.00 before they could address the problem! This is a brand new out of the box product. HP is a scam."
4,Love the HD not the SW,"Software does not work with network drives / network neighborhood/ etc. This is disappointing and embarrassing in a shared work environment - as well as home.I can't find any third party software that supports this HD format. Can't convert .m2ts to WMV or any other format! Can't edit / use it with my premier elements, VideoReDo, click to DVD, DiVX convertor, Windows Media Encoder, Quicktime, etc."
5,The title says it well. A soul's journey.,"If we wonder about the big picture of our individual story, this book gives an answer. I have been satisfied by what I read, which amazes me because I tend to have an insatiable appettite for spiritual knowledge. I think it is an extraordinary book with a plain and simple approach, yet utterly profound.The information in A Soul's Journey corresponds with my experience, and with information from other treasured sources.In response to the first reviewer, I would like to say A Soul's Journey is not truly representative of Hinduism, Buddhism or Taoism, or general eastern thought. This is a book that details reincarnation for the western mind. Reincarnation is one aspect of eastern religion, but not the whole or even the largest part of eastern thought. I think this book is a gift to westerners who wish to get an overview, as well as a personal experience, of a soul's journey"
2,It's ok,This book was fast and easy to read. It all sounds like it would work great but the only problem I found was when I got to the menu part it seems as if I would ALWAYS be shopping for my next meal. I can't afford to buy a little of this and a little of that to just make 1 meal. My husband was willing to eat the meals as well because they sound so yummy. Only problem is our fridge would be packed full if we bought enough food to last us through the week of meals. We would probably be broke and we would have left over half used items going to waste. We now just use the book to pick out meals that sound good and use it as a cookbook idea for the night. I hope it works well for others but it just doesn't fit into my lifestyle right now.
5,amazing!!!,This album is truly one of the best albums I've bought this year. Her voice is hipnotizing. She just sounds so cute. The Elvis cover was great! yeah!
3,Worth the Watch,"If you've been down this road... this is worth the watch! Well done, but all in captions. I did not find this a distraction as I am glad the story is finally told."
2,Book review,I bought to read to my child in hopes to make him feel better about himself. He did not care for the book. As an adult I thought it was good but bought it for my child to understand what was going on in his mind.
3,TONS OF STICKERS TO PUT ON,"It does seem that the 4-6 yr olds who visit us are most interested in this. It's most fun to just cruise around; you'll likely want to buy additional sets of vehicles(sets under $5). The worst thing is that it took me OVER AN HOUR to get DOZENS OF STICKERS in place (several buildings have windows, building facades, traffic lines)!!! If this is a gift to your child, put them on before you give it - it was so frustrating!!"
2,Not Too Sturdy,I bought this for my son who played with something similiar atmy sisters. Thought he really loves this gotta get one or something similiar. Broke within a week or so. Doesn't seem sturdy enough and won't fit together very easily.
1,Absolute Garbage,This piece of trash fell apart in the first five minutes of play time. A total waste of money and a complete rip off. Hasbro should join Martha Stewart in prison.
5,SCORPIONS HEAVY METAL SUPREME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THESE TWO DISC HAVE EVERY SCORP'S HIT AND THERE ALL KILLER THE SCORPIONS ARE ONE OF MY ALLTIME FAV METAL OUTFITS OF THE 80'S YOU WANT HITS YOU GOT THEM ALL RIGHT HERE THIS IS A KILLER GREATEST ALBUM.THE SCORPIONS ARE A KILLERMETAL BAND!!!!!!!!!!LONG LIV THE SCORPIONS METAL RULZ!!!!!!!!80'SMETAL RULZ!!!
2,A decent flick,"I had high hopes for this after watching ""not quite hollywood"",but had my hopes dashed.for me it was boring,kinda creepy,but boring.the actors were good at bitching at each other,and the film looks great.i just wish they would have turned the threat level up a notch.not bad,but it didnt do it for me...."
1,1950 DVD which I got separately is a ripoff,"The 1950 DVD which I got separately is a ripoff. None of the three beautiful women in the clear cover shots are anywhere in the DVD, instead there is scratched blurry film of mostly very ugly women. Dunno about the other two CDs."
3,Indian Take-Out: One from Column A....,"Pleasant gay romantic comedy, but overly familiar. Viewers who aren't acquainted with flicks before the advent of Lindsay Lohan may be enthralled, but if you've seen LA CAGE, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, MONSOON WEDDING, PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, or any one of several dozen oldies but goodies, you'll recognize various bits and pieces as they float by here. However, an engaging cast, some laugh-out loud funny lines, the odd surprise twist in the screenplay (dramatic situations old when Thespis hauled that second actor up on stage will suddenly blossom into territory we've never seen before), and a general our-heart's-in-the-right-place air here make it worth a watch."
5,Key Lime heaven,This stuff is sweet but has a distinct lime/key lime smell and flavor. I love it! Can't wait to try the lemon/lime blend I saw here.
4,"For a price, this is a great game","I have installed it on Vista home Premium without any issues. Graphics are good (not half-life2 like, but what do you expect for $17?), game play is really good. Much more detailed shots and advanced game play than Virtua tennis or similar games. The biggest problem so far for me is incredibly long load times. It takes sometimes more than a minute for the game to go from one level to the next. I don't know if this is an issue just for me, so i would appreciate if people let us know if this is a known issue.Other than that, so far it's been good. No wide screen is another culprit, but the game does not look bad in 4:3 format either.Gamepad is a must for playing this game, forget about the mouse and keyboard."
3,"Finally, it works","Without this detachable stem, the stemless blades sold by Anmazon will NOT work on a 7 cup machine. Glad that after multiple complaints, Amazon located this NECESSARY attachment. With it, the blade I bought months ago actually works."
2,"Interesting concepts, many missing details, sloppy","This book is aimed at developers already advanced in VB, COM, MTS, and SQL. The author presents an interesting generic framework for implementing persistent distributed objects using Microsoft technologies. Most unfortunately, many details are missing from the example code, some of it depends on code not presented until future chapters or at all, and the downloadable code does not match what is presented in the book. Even within the book itself, some of the UML class models don't match what is described in the text. The concepts of the framework were useful to me, especially the generic database classes, but I expect more attention to detail in a technical book."
4,Fantastic Resource...,"I recently rolled off of a project that was predominantly a Microsoft platform. Paul's book for me, was a great help from start to finish. The title is an extremely accurate description of how he presents valuable information to the reader.A pleasant addendum to Paul's book, is the fact that he builds and refers to a very real world enterprise application, using all of the components that he covers thoroughly: VB, MTS, IIS, MSSQL, and XML. For example, Chapter 7 covers the ""Class Manager Library"" which the author builds in great detail. He covers all components with equal committment, and then follows it up with great instruction on how to take it to the web in Chap. 12.Cheers to Tindall for writing a succinct and well thought out book that has an extremely honest title, and jeers to those who attempt to lead you to buy their book via a misleading market buzzwords and fluff. Thanks for the honest picture - it helped me get a great project review!"
1,Horrible. 1 star for the picture on the cover..,"This book left me so frustrated. I tried for a week to play some of the songs while listening to the cd's of his, but after some time I just gave up. The tabs are just wrong (supposedly they are right somewhere, but they don't come close the cd versions)Now then. You have no options but to search the internet and try to find something that sounds close, and then try very hard to listen to the cd and add in little details that you won't find in the internet tab. This is probably a better route anyway because you are growing musically.So.. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, AND HAPPINESS ON THIS BOOK."
4,Thin kline mufler,"Just to let you know about the Flow master muffler I selected: I wanted a muffler that was not too ""tall"" so I could install it under the running board of my hot rod Chrysler. This was the closest I could find. It will do the Job and I think there is room to develop a smaller and more compact version even yet. This is the best I could find for the unique application that I have."
3,I was quite dissapointed with this book.,"The book is great for someone who wishes to use the Author's DLLs to write MIDI programs. Unfortunately, I bought it to learn how to write MIDI programs using the Microsoft Multimedia SDK functions and this book was not adequate for my needs. Note that some of the things his DLLs require (such as transmitting SysEx one byte at a time) is, at best, a kludge and surely not to be looked upon as elegant coding.You can find out a lot more about Windows MIDI functions by reading Microsoft's SDK, as poorly written as they are. For instance, no mention is made at all in this book about an entire section of MIDI functions, those which deal with using MIDI streams.It wouldn't have been so bad if the author had at least spent time going over the code in his DLLs and explaning how he did what and why. But, I don't feel enough of that was done.Unfortunately, there is still not one good book available detailing how to write MIDI apps using the Microsoft Multimedia SDK."
5,Loved Every Bit,"This book is great if u want the inside scoop on the Olsens. I kinda like them, but now, after I read the book, I like them even more!!! Read if u like the Olsens!"
2,Trial size,"I love Jelly Bellies and was more than pleased to purchase the packets for my daughter'sfriends goody bags. Just to make you aware of the size....the box is labelled ""trial size"".It looks like free samples that you get in groceries, etc. Just wanted to emphasize thetininess of it."
2,When shaving my unique sound collection this was the UFO to,After stumbling onto the first UFO by accident I was happy to find a group worthy of being placed with Yello and 9 Lazy 9. The second album was a joy as well. THIS is the one where all their tricks lose luster. It does have it's momements (3 songs) but the rest is filler. I will still buy the next one without hesitation.
3,very good... few small problems,"the product is good and promising for a bussy userbut there are few problems :1- No good support.2- It frozes in two occasions, so I have to restart it again, and it is a very good practice to keep it sync everyday with your main computer.3- it turned off by itself 6 times... that is really bad, because this ment that I have to re-sync with my computer, a process usually takes time and efford, and you wouldn't like it to happen SIX time."
1,This [stinks],"OMG! I just spent how much money on this handheld for built-in WiFi that won't even work! I follow the instuctions and it says something like: cannot utilze wifi. Even after multiple resets it wont work! This is my second toshiba pda (had e740) and be rest assured I will not buy another toshiba product. Even when I call customer service with problems I and others are experiencing, i get the same thing: uhh, i've never heard of that happening befoe. I STRONGLY advise any potential buyers to stay away from toshiba."
1,Don't let the features fool you.,"I purchased this unit for all of the features: compact flash slot and secure digital, WI FI, good amount of memory, etc. all for a reasonable price.However, after using it for only a few days it would not turn off. I had to reset the machine. Then the file explorer would lock up and I could not get it to shut down.I kept this PDA for almost 30 days trying everything I could to keep it running. After having to reset it 8-10 times, losing all of my data each time, I just couldn't stand it anymore. I checked with a friend who had also owned this model Toshiba. He and his boss had the same exact problems. That's three examples that this machine is just unstable. I finally had to return it, very disappointed."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Terrible. Not only is this book written at a fifth grade level, but the history is unbelievably flawed. For instance, she suggests that women were not allowed near the Temple, despite such evidence as Josephus and Anna in Luke! She certainly has no concept of first century Judaism. If you are looking for a good text on the NT, try Bart Ehrman or Duling and Perrin.This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
4,You decide,"""The Only Way"" / ""Infinite Space"" are trite, as well as everything else here. The shining redemption comes with the first half of the album: Tarkus - perhaps the single best piece that ELP ever recorded."
2,"Better than gold, not vinyl","This review focuses purely on whether or not this remastered version is worth buying. I rate the sound quality a 2. In short because thats what it was. This remaster was less than I expected but it beat the previously issued gold disk hands down. The problem is that when you juxtipose it against a fresh vinly with Hirsh boost recorded on a CD it's not even in the same category. Start pressing the albums again for all ELP productions. Dont waste time re-reissuing cause the original master tapes are juiced out. Stop exposing them to air and reel to reel machines. It's over. Press more vinyl and burn it to disk. You can't get better dynamics, definition and crispness."
1,A piece of junk,This radar detector is a piece of junk. It had no back on it and did not even work in the slightess. I tried to get my money back but the vendor or Amazon have done nothing to make that happen even after I have sent numerous emails to both. I am extremely dissatisfied.
3,Good but not great,"New unit does pick up radar signals but seems more random than my cord unit. Not as much advance warning for some encounters but plenty on others. Unit did jam and had to be reset with power-up once after a month of use. Not as much flexibility in controlling unit as cord model (8 years old). Have used Escort for 30 years. If you can go with cord, do so, if must have portable I would bet this is the best of the lot given Brand history."
4,Good cordless detector,"So far this unit has worked well, Just hope I don't forget to turn it on. There's no cord to mess with. In the past I have paid to have detector cords routed behind the mouldings, but that's expensive.So far so good with the cordless .........."
2,Expensive with below average performance,I bought this for use with my car and motorcycle so needed a battery version. In the motorcycle it fits in a pocket and uses an earphone and can't get laser but all cruisers use radar here (Ontario) and stationary laser has no real defense.I find that even on the highway I am seeing the cruiser often well before I get a signal - car or bike. I think they are using a very weak RF signal but even if they do the product should adjust or stop making claims.
1,CORDLESS!?! HAH!! Better invest in Duracell!!,"I bought this unit brand new. In less than 1.5 weeks, had to replace the batteries THREE times. Talked to their tech support and was told that expected battery life is approximately 35-40 hours. No way did I drive for 105-120 hours in that one and half weeks!! Considering the unit is supposed to be battery operated, 35-40 hours seems a paltry amount.I agree that you'll have to buy the Smart Cord instead of relying on batteries. But save yourself the extra $30 for the S2 and the additional $30 for the Smart Cord and just buy the already corded 8500.The idea of it being a cordless unit is a total and absolute ripoff!!! They need to extend the battery life to at least 100 hours for this to be a viable product."
1,NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH!!!,"Got a ticket using this unit. Then I got the 8500X50 and put them side-by-side and noticed that X50 gave me extra 3~5 seconds of reaction time - which are GOLDEN. At times, S2 SOLO completely failed to alert me of police signals. All it does well is to pick up automated mall doors and some other useless frequencies. AVOID IT. FYI, I am getting the S3 this week to try it out. Will post its review soon. Hope it has gotten better because cordless is the way to go."
1,quit working after 13 months,The radar worked great for a little while. Now thirteen months later it will not power on. This is the third one that has died on me.
4,Very nice product,This salt is a very nice grey salt. I only wish i had bought a bigger size as it didnt last very long. but its very good
1,Disappointed,"The book has never arrived. The vendor has promised to ""resend"" - no results yet. Order placed in late April. Today is Memorial Day. I'll update when/if the book arrives."
3,"unless it's for school, skip it","Like many of you out there, I read this book for my freshman English class at the University of Kansas. Maybe part of the problem was that it was assigned over Thanksgiving Break, but this novel could not keep my attention. The message was valuable, but definitely not recommended for a leisurely read."
1,Ceremony was a horrible book,this book was a confusing mess and i was forced to read it. the whole time i wished Tayo would come to life and try to kill me with a beer bottle. it was so tangled up.
2,so so,"The book is a really difficult to understand. You have to love the Myth in order to understand the book and to like it. I'm more about science and that made it even harder to get the meaning of the book. It is about how the Myth plays an important role in your life and you don'teven realize it. Myth can be your land, or anythingthat relate to you since you were born. Once you refuse to beharmony with myth, bad thing will happen to you."
2,Hard Time,"I needed to read this for a class in desert lit, and I found the book to be difficult. Not because of the non-linier format but because of the authors style. Stylistically, she has much to say and needs to say it. This book was easy to put down!"
2,"The best of times, the worst of times...","Ratings for this book were 5 stars and 1 star when I first visited here :)None in between ! Ceremony was required reading for many too young to grasp the 140+ word sentences in the first few pages. For old men over fifty, we can cope with that technique, unhappily. The native American situation in America and a pow camp for contrast was most vivid. One reviewer stated that that Ceremony avoided bitterness and racial animosity; I couldn't disagree more. Of course it was there and justly deserved ! Another reviewer stated that we can't rely on Silko for accurate data on Reservations. I have been to one in central Wisconsin, Silko is right. One is a majority when it is the truth. Silko needs more years, and perhaps a writing class or two."
1,You either love the book or hate it.,"It took forever for me to read this book. I thought the way Silko choose to write it, intertwined with myths and chants, was beautiful, but made it difficult to understand. I found that the story line was pretty slow and didn't seem to go much of anywhere. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see an interesting writting style, but if you want to get into a plot with strong charactors, then you should definetly choose something else."
2,polly,"I cannot believe that so many people reviewed this film and did not mention the amazing work of Sarah Lassez who played Polly/Egg. I have to admit that I did not like the movie and fastforwarded past many parts (I also have to mention that I am well out of the teenage years which could help explain why I did not care for the movie), but I thought the character of Polly was so well done. She demonstrated such innocence and naivety I was heartbroken to see what happened to her. I felt that she was the only true to life character and showing that she was from a home with a very loving father just made me feel more sympathy for her situation."
3,flashback,"My friends accuse me of being pretty pretentious when it comes to film, but even I like this movie. It may not be the greatest work of art in the world, but it is visually stunning. Excellent art direction. Compared to the hackneyed teen movies of my generation, this one at least has a sense of humor. The end of this movie is hilarious. I won't give it away... but I think that the ending alone shows that this director isn't taking this movie as serously as some might think. I-R-O-N-Y. Definitely less depressing than the director's other movies like Doom Generationn."
3,Good cd,"Ok dont get me wrong I love the bosstones but I only liked a few songs on this cd, I think jack knife to a swan is better"
2,Bosstones Falter,"After 4 albums of hard core ska-core, the Bosstones appear to have grown tired of their relative obscurity in the world of music. They have toned down their hard edge and Dicky has softened his voice on this album. Also, their guitarist has set aside his intense, distorted guitar riffs for more sedate pop sounds. In general, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones wanted to sell some albums so they made their music more radio friendly and entered the arena of pop-ska. Not to say this album is terrible, but a faithful Bosstones fan will want to pass over this CD. They lose a star off their rating because of the sell-out factor."
2,What happened?,"What the ... happened to these cats? They use to be so awesome. Remember their actually brilliant jamz like Toxic Toast and just about that whole Question The Answers album days. That's the MMB I once remembered. The packed ampetheater days at the warped tour with other awesome bands like Rancid, Sick Of It All,...etc. Those times rocked. I seen these guys 2 years ago and they didn't even have that energy that they once did. It was a pretty boring show unlike the first time I saw them. I think Dickey and the boys need to hang it up."
1,This CD sucked!!,"I got the ' Bosstone's cd as a gift, and I loved receiving it because I knew ""The Impression that I get"" was on there. That is in fact the only good song on there. This group needs to call it quits after 5 or some albums. I don't even want to hear the other ones. THUMBS DOWN!!"
4,In a category of its own,"could this really work -- a Hendrixian B-3 power-trio playing classical? Could Mussorgsky really be mixed with Jimmy Smith licks and sci-fi movie-soundtrack synth?You'd better believe it could, and here's the evidence -- 33 minutes of continuous performance. ELP's high energy pushes Mussorgsky's material with such unbridled enthusiasm we can't help but be pushed along. Yes, at times it can get a bit silly -- that's part of the charm; ELP never intended to be taken seriously. If you can't have fun here, where can you have it?I probably enjoy it more now than I did so long ago as a teen. PICTURES hasn't aged at all, still full of the youthful vigor that went into making it. So good it doesn't need bonus tracks ;-)"
5,Are you kidding me?,"I grew up with the ELP icon on my canvas binder in 1975 Catholic School in NJ. I love this band, they just did stuff no one else could touch. Saw Pictures at an Exhibition live in NJ back in the 90's and it still made me want for more. Great musicians step over the line and leave us wondering. Put on the old koss head phones and listen again!"
4,Pictures at an Exhibition,"I was an ELP fan in the day, and have most of their library on LP. I had picked up a CD compilation, but it had nothing from Pictures. There are a couple of excellent live vocal performances by Greg Lake on this album. I saw them perform in Jacksonville FL in the late 70s. This album is very reprensentative of their live performance style, So while not their best album, it was just what I was looking for."
3,KIller Diller Is OK,"Killer Diller is another book about Mattie and Wesley, almost a sequel to Walking Across Egypt. Wesley is in a home that places strict rules and curfews on him. He is in a band. He is in love with an overweight woman, who is staying at the Nutrition House on Ballard University campus. Wesley is searching for the meaning of the bible and he begins preaching. He's also become a part of Project Promise, a chance to teach a mentally challenged child his talents. He gets this boy in his band playing bass. Then Mattie has a heart attack and Wesley tries to sneak out. He ends up in the hospital with Mattie! Mattie gets put in a nursing home, and Wesley's roommate, Ben, has been talking about escaping... This novel is pretty good. I enjoyed reading it, even though Mattie seems to have lost her spunk. If you've read Walking Across Egypt, then you should read Killer Diller, just to catch up with old Mattie and Wesley."
5,The tie that binds...,"This is a very special book. Written by Wodehouse at age 90, it celebrates the deep affection and friendship that grew between Bertie and Jeeves as a result of their many years of shared adventures--""the tie that binds"".Followers of the series know that Bertie belongs to the Drones men's club. In chapter one, we learn that Jeeves has also long belonged to a club for ""gentlemen's gentlemen"" (butlers and valets) known as the Junior Ganymede. The Junior Ganymede requires its members to contribute information about their employers to the club book. When this book (complete with its 11 pages of ""dynamite"" about poor Bertie's misadventures) is stolen by a villianous ex-valet a crisis ensues.Friends of Bertie and Jeeves will greatly enjoy the warm, gentle humor of ""Jeeves and the Tie That Binds""."
4,A Damning Treatise On The Dangers Of Socialism And Group Think,It takes a village took Nazi Germany to the brink of extiction and exterminated millions.Quake when you hear people push the socialist agenda.
2,Bravo for Cassie,"Maybe you thought Yumi was the main character, but the one to be most admired is certainly Cass. She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked. Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults. It was an okay book, but predictable. Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel. In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third."
5,"Wonderful follow-up to ""My Year of Meats""","As a vegetarian, I was even more personally affected by the specter of sterile seeds Ozeki cleverly intertwined into her enormously engaging novel than I was by the horrors of industrial meat production explored in ""My Year of Meats."" More importantly, this sophomore outing by Ozeki is packed with delightful characters and moving relationships between children and parents, friends and lovers. Glad to hear she has another novel due out soon, as she's an author I'd like to keep reading and reading."
5,Excellent book!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It's winter here in Canada - time to cuddle up in front of the fireplace and read about potato farming!!! No seriously, the characters in this book are almost life like - and the way Ms. Ozeki brings them to life in these pages is great. I found this book VERY hard to put down. You will not be disappointed with this book. I am now looking at getting her other book ""My Year of Meats""."
2,Shipping Nightmare,"I'm sure the adhesive is fine, but I rate this low for the total purchase experience. Be aware that when the shipping note says that the adhesive cannot be sent with other items IT INCLUDES OTHER TUBES OF THE SAME ADHESIVE. I ordered 24 tubes, and it was sent in 24 separate large boxes (each maybe large enough for 10 tubes of caulk), and, since they were not packed supported by surrounding tubes, most were partially damaged and several were damaged so as to be unusable.And now I have to dispose of 24 additional boxes."
4,"Grat rock, not enough soul","Being one on Widesread Panic's earlier releases this album features more of a classic rock theme with more basic chord progressions and arrangements than their more recent releases. Looking back with 20/20 hindsight it is easy to tell that at this point the band hadn't quite come into their pinnacle of songwriting that they have now. Of course, with this album Widespread Panic continues the true rock and roll tradition that seems to be underground at this point. A great album for those who love rock."
5,reality check,"this is a beautifully written, funny, easy to read must do before entertaining any thoughts of moving to the country."
3,Good reference,"I ordered this book after having been in an abusive relationship with an eye toward understanding the person I had been dealing with. After receiving it, it does seem more that it is not as geared toward the ""lay person"" as it could be. I think it would be a good reference for psychologists or psychiatrists dealing with this type of personality, but found it a bit technical for my taste."
5,really love this classic,I always loved these as a kid growing up and I love to share this with my nieces and nephews.!
4,Great - but not 'quite' there...,"Like everyone else, I loved these from my childhood. And now we are watching them with our son loving every minute.Price is great and packaging is top notch. However, it may be just me, but I was hoping that Little Drummer Boy would have been cleaned up / remastered a little more...a great show is hurt by the muddy vhs transfer; this is a shame because it's a true gem in the Rankin / Bass collection.Finally whoever owns the rights needs to release the following on dvd as well:The First Christmas SnowThe Little Drummer Boy, Book II,The Life & Adventures of Santa ClausAll in all a great buy."
5,Great videos.,This is a great video collection. Bought this for my grandchildren and they love to watch it. Nice to have to be able to watch these before they come on TV.
4,"Great set but I thought it included the original ""Grinch"".","My three-year-old son really got into this animated series when he saw it on TV. We always seemed to be busy during these TV specials and I saw an ad for this DVD set on TV during one of the commercial breaks. I swore, however, that it showed the original ""Grinch that Stole Christmas"". My husband and I were the only disappointed ones once I received this in the mail. My son didn't seem to mind.After searching and comparing prices online, I found that the Amazon site was the best deal around.We've enjoyed watching all of these DVD's over, and over, and over, and over again! Of course when I say ""we"", I mean my 3-yr-old.Great set and I'm sure we'll be watching it into the heat of the summer."
5,ver,"A very worthwhile purchase~A very rewarding work of Nostalgia. If you are younger then I am, I still recommend this 4 CD collection. A Christmas treasure for the young and old at Heart! Don't hesitate about adding it to your list. Thank you Amazon, for making it available.Michael (morning star 88)"
3,good classics,"I really got this one for Rudolph, the rest were a bonus. I have no idea why they even make copies of Cricket on the Hearth or Mr. Magoo's Christmas anymore... I could hardly stand to watch them with my little girl! They were just so poorly done. I'd rather throw them away than store them. The rest are pretty good."
5,great grab gift,"I bought 5 of these. They made great, most appreciated, gifts. Each of the 7 movies were true Christmas Classics."
5,Best christmas collection,this set is perfect. It is constantly being played in our house. and it comes with a Christmas CD with about 10 songs on it.
1,CBS rip-off kills this set,"What ruins this set for me is the inclusion of the horrible ""Frosty Returns."" This was NOT the sequel to Frosty the Snowman. It was created by CBS in 1992 and is horrible. Rankin and Bass had nothing to do with it. R&B did, however, create the true sequel to Frosty the Snowman, called Frosty's Winter Wonderland...where he meets and marries Crystal. Replace the CBS crap with this true gem, and I'll buy this set. Otherwise, forget it."
2,What a RIP-OFF!!,"The tittle implies that there are 7 christmas favorites in this collection, but in reality, there are only THREE!!! Rudolf, Santa Claus is comin' to town, and Frosty the Snowman are the only actual videos on the dvd, the rest are just songs!!! So if you want the other stories, plan to buy them individually! My Daughter and I were very disappointed. I wish it(the dvd collection,) had been described correctly."
2,No a good selection of X-Mas movies.,"No subs, few alternat languages and the movies are bad. Maybe 2 o 3 movies from the 9 in the disc are decent and enjoyable. Better wait and see them on TV. This is tottaly for little kids."
3,Jack the Ripper,Well-written book. Worth a read especially if you are a dedicated Ripperologist like I am.
5,This was both imformative and inspiring body of work,"I have long been a fan of Dr. Francess Cress Wellsing after reading her book THE ISIS PAPERS some 20 years ago. Tariq Nasheed has done a wonderful job putting this work together and presenting it in a clear and consice manner. I showed the film to my 17 year old son and he flipped out. First there was anger, followed by disapointment and finally ""curiousity"" to learn MORE. Now he is reading historical referance books for himself and his own enlightenment. Taking the time to sift through the words for the HIDDEN TRUTH! Now that is what I call SELF DETERMINATION in action.Don't borrow this video, BUY IT and share it with someone young!"
1,Poor quality,"I had to send this DVD back, because the image froze about 3/4's of the way in to the documentary."
3,Interesting,It's always interesting how people of color are viewed and/or regarded around the world. Interesting history facts and cultural educaton.
2,"All the ""pleasing"" sound of a baying bassett hound","Listening to this album, I finally realized why Michael McDonald's vocals bother me so much. His voice sounds as if he's singing out of breath and holding his nose. A thin-throated, hollow howl that grows more irritating (for some of us) with each exposure. McDonald's monotone delivery ultimately comes across as a tiresome drone. He shares a ""Minimal Vocal Range Award"" with Phil Collins, another droner. Both Mike and Phil need substitute singers---""pinch-singers?""---to do their vocals for them."
2,Rehash,"This crap has already been released upteen times. Why dont you come up with something new Mr McDonald? Or tell your record company to release something then the same old crap that has been on the Best Of The Doobies, The Very Best of this, Greates Hits of that. BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoy His Hits minus the Motown Tribute Disc Material he has done. Michael Mcdonald has a Soulful voice,His Material good&catchy but His voice always stood out more for me on Hooks. His Vocals&Playing with the Doobie Brothers was on time as was His Vocal work with Steely Dan&also with Christopher Cross. this is a Pretty Good collection."
4,Love that Michael McDonald.,Very good CD. Love the song High on The Mountain. Could listen to it all day. May buy another CD later.
3,Homeschooler review,"If you have a little boy who balks at reading, this would make a great first reader. The words are simple and repeated often, and there are suggested activities to go with each chapter that would appeal to little boys; building a sailing ship; making simple tools. The reader may get a little boring for an able reader because of the repetitiveness, but for a child who struggles it may give him some confidence that he can read, and if he is into survival skills, you can correlate those type of activites into the study to break up the reading. Also, I would suggest that it might be neat to keep a daily diary similar to what Robinson Crusoe did. Depending on the child's writing ability, you may want to have your son dictate as you write down his thoughts and words in large print for him to reread on his own later."
1,Wake up call?,"This book was informative as far as explaining who some of these groups are in the middle east. But it adds to the aggravation of being told the same old fairy tales over and over again which by now have been proven not to be the truth! When are these people ""in the know"" going to get it?"
5,Mad Mullahs live in a virtual world,"I am an Iranian, and the Atomic Iran unfortunately is a true story.I would encourage Dr. Jerome Corsi to write about the human rights violation or political prisoners in Iran that causes by the mad Mullahs. I am willing to provide you with substantial documents that you may need to start another book."
2,A difficult read,"As important as the subject matter might be, this book drags and is a labor to read. Can't review it based on the topic, but as reading material it's just awful. I suspect if Dr. Corsi had teamed up with a really good writer the collaborative effort would have been much better."
5,Worked for me,I was looking for information on how to play bluegrass lead and found this book. I was able to quickly teake the licks presented here and put them to work.Worked great for me!
2,An Oldtimer,"The first part of the film didn't do much but by the end: Lon Chaney Jr., Bela Lugosi, and John Carradine have their best time on the screen in this film."
1,Not very happy,I bought this DVD recorder combo and it did work well at first. After a year the finalizing function stopped to work and all the DVDs I have recorded and did not finalized yet are useless since they can not be played on other DVD players because the finalizing was not done.
3,un huh ok,It is ok not much to talk about very confusing and nothing much to rate on it. My preference may be different from others who like the writers
4,Columbo,"The 1994 TV movie ""Columbo: Undercover"" is based on this book. In the movie, Columbo is substituted for several different characters from the book, alternating from scene-to-scene. Sometimes he's the book's Detective Carella, other times he takes over for Detective Brown, who also appears in the movie. As confusing as this may sound, the movie is actually a very faithful adaptation of the book - even the pieces of the photo are identical to the illustrations in the book. Fans of the book should check out the movie (which is available on DVD in the UK, but not yet in the US)."
5,"A ""true to the heart"" read... very engaging and insightful.","Rob Morris and Rep. Steve Gunderson tell their story very well. The layout is very well done with Rob and Steve each having their own section in each chapter. I couldn't recommend a better book to politicaly motivated gay men and women. Oh, and yes, a great cover design too!"
4,Good Intro to Hegel,"If you remember a series published by Oxford in the 1980s called ""Oxford Past Masters,"" this is a revised reprint of Singers original outline in that series (also a good series worth searching for in any old bookstore).The style is good. I read two chapters on a mountaineering weekend by flashlight and as a result remember his entire idea about the struggle of history being a ""striving for the realisation of freedom."" His whole definition of Freedom is also adequately layed out in the book.Although it is asking a lot in 122 pages to lay out Hegel's ideas, he does a good job. He connects Hegel with modern convervatism and you can see where the current obsession in the US Bush admin could come from and there is also the traditional interpretations of Hegal ""being stood on his head"" as understood by Marx. There is even an interesting section on freewill that has implications for modern marketing techniques.All in all this is a great book."
1,"Why do you play with Hegel, master?","I was really surprised to see my Singer cheri having written a book about Hegel. Why Hegel? Why the vulgarisation of philosophy? Who is supposed to read it? I did, 'cause I said to myself that this might be a kind of joke, but unfortunatelly it was not. But I will never understand why do we committ this kind of ""litterature"". Do not judge Singer using this book. He has much more to say."
4,listen to the music,"Mojave 3 has been around for seven years and this is their fourth album. Cornwall native Neil Halstead did a solo record, Sleeping On Roads, last year, and it was received well. Much of their work is about lost love and emotional states. This expression has brought out the girls in search of a sensitive poet. Mojave 3 recorded this record during the last part of 2002. They have always been into roots rocks and Americana. They retreated to the cow pastures of Cornwall where they have a studio. Most of the band now live in London. This record recalls winter and quiet places. Every song is subtle and packed with emotion. Songs like ""Bluebird of Happiness"" and ""Billoddity"" have more piano and moogs than the past records. It's like a record that you listen to on a cold winter day in a dark room alone. There is true beauty in melancholy and loss if you look for it. This record is for those kind of moods."
1,out of stock,the thread was not in stock. If people advertize a product they should be sure to have the inventory in stock.
1,magnificent obession,Unable to play DVD because it was Region 2. Vendor did not state DVD was out of Region in ad. I complained....vendor said he would replace DVD. This has not happened. Very disappointed
5,Love this Lens,"I am a mother photographer, meaning, my daughter gets most of the lens time. Although I am an avid gardener and wanted to to pics of the 4,6 and eight legged creatures that I came across. After receiving this lens, I found a butterfly, snapped it, then zoomed in on its head. IT WAS PHENONMINAL. Definatly worth the money. I had read a review about needing a tripod to keep the lens steady, but I have not found that to be yet. A steady hand helps but I have not needed any more support.Enjoy!!!"
3,Go for ipaq 1935 instead of this one!,"i bought this one two weeks ago and returned it after 3days. i noticed that its battery life is not very good.further you need to send it to toshiba for a replacementbattery after 1-2 year of use (i called toshiba service).it still does not fit in a pocket well....fortunately, during that period, ipaq 1935 came outat the same price after rebate.1935 has everything e355 has except thatit uses a slower processor, but i dont use it forintensive computing. it is a lot smaller. it is battery lifeis quite good....very happy to swtich to 1935"
5,Kodak D-22 Dock Adapter Kit,Out standing value. The package came on time and all that I ordered was there. Couldn't be any happier
2,Safety,"I have ordered this product hoping that it will look nice in the kids room, will be very practical and will add more color to the entire space.The problem with it is the unstability. If not blocked or put on one side to the wall or any heavy piece of furniture, the rack is NOT STABLE. Be sure it is well asambled.Other than that, it looks good just like in the picture. Tempting."
5,Pleased,The book I ordered came quickly and in excellent condition. I belong to a volunteer group called In2Books and I order a lot of young child books. This was one of the best sites I have ordered from.Diann
2,very dissapointing for my little spiderman fan,"My four year old son asked for this for christmas 2004. This is all he ever said he wanted. We were so dissapointed to see his face when it would not work. After about 20 tries spiderman managed to make it half way down the lamposts. Toy makers pay attention!! Santa brings these toys. Would you want your child realizing the toy he asked santa for, and talked about for two months, does not work? I gave five stars for the educational value because he learned a valuable lesson to not judge a toy by what you see on tv. I gave it two stars because it was not a total bust. He loves the little figures that came with it, and uses his imagination when he plays with it. But for forty bucks it should do what it says it will do."
1,JUNK,"Not only did it not work. Amazon will not take it back after 30 days. This, because I bought it for a CHristmas gift two months before CHristmas, and upon opening the gift, it did not work. Took it to a local store and was told it was the camera. I bought it new from Amazon. Poor return policy, and camera is JUNK."
4,Great Camera,The Nikon S1 has been the best digital camera I own. Due to it's small size I can carry it everyplace and the pictures are great. If you are looking for a handy camera to have around this is it.
5,Great little camera.,"The Nikon Coolpix S1 camera takes great quality photos and comes in the perfect size. We also purchased the Waterproof case (WP-CP5) to take underwater photos, and I was very pleased with the camera's ability to take high quality pictures there as well. I am very satisfied with our digital camera."
1,Do not buy this camera!,"I am returning my second Coolpix S1. I absolutely love this camera, but after a few weeks, the white spots start showing up. They ruin your pictures. I contacted Nikon and they did not respond. Luckily Amazon is giving me a refund. I own a Nikon N75 and it is the best camera I have ever owned. I am very dissapointed in Nikon with the Coolpix. Any suggestion for a replacement..."
4,Great compact camera,"I like this one. It's small and sleek so you can put it in your pocket when you're on the go. The only thing that I would say is not so good is the flash. I took the camera to a show and had to get right up to the stage in order for the picture to come out a little brighter. Otherwise, good camera for the price - I saw the same one at Office Depot for almost $300.00! Ridiculous, get it from Amazon definitely."
1,Nice small camera but too fragile,Got this camera because I wanted a smaller camera to fit in my purse and take point and shoot pics. Takes great pics outside but all inside pics are too dark and have red eye. Even with the red eye turned on there is still some red eye. Flash is not powerful enough for indoors for sure. I do like the small size but it is pretty fragile. The lens cover slides open and closed each time you turn it on and mine wore out after a year and is stuck shut (and just out of warranty). Nikon charges so much to fix it is better to just get a new one. So be super careful and gentle with it and always keep camera in its case and maybe you'll have better luck than me!
5,Required reading for any expat in training,"This book and author are required reading for any expat in training. Before you sell your house and sponsor a high end Bangkok stripper, stuff your luggage with some of Moore's novels. Just make sure you lock your valuables in your hotel safe before you hit Soi Cowboy."
1,This product is FLAWED,"Yes it is true, the unit will not automatically turn on when the wheel starts spinning.So therefore, you go out on a trip and forget to push the button to turn it on and lose the mileage for your tripThis a fatal flaw I don't think any bike computer acts this way.I wasted my money on this piece of junk."
3,O.K. for well lit area,"This is fine for a small, well lit, and I do mean well, lit area. not even a readable image in low light. The moniter is great, picture is clear and it has audio. Maybe a better camera would work. If I bought again I would try a better camera"
5,Pleasant Surprise...,"Fearing it was just another ""do it my way or else"" organization book - I was thrilled to read so many practical tips & hints for reducing clutter and finding purpose to my everyday living. Not only that, but the format is written in small pieces - short chapters - so it is easy to manage in my busy life. I have already applied many different suggestions and directions she offers and have found a little more peace in our home & family! I highly recommend this for busy women - wives, moms, career - for its ease of use and practical applications."
2,Not the most helpful,"Having read this book I really did not find it helpful at all. If I had known that every chapter and section had biblical anologies added I would never have bought or read it. By no means am I not a Christian, but I was looking for help in juggling being a mommy, a professional, a wife and all the other hundred roles that women take on every day. I would not recommend this to anyone looking to really try to get organized unless you also enjoy being preached too."
3,Unfortunately Dated,"When if first came out over a quarter of a century ago this was a welcomed addition to the field since there was so little available in English on Korean history especially on premodern history. It was and is a well written narrative history of Korea by five of the leading scholars in the field. It can still be useful as a reference but the scholarship is now a bit dated as much new work has been done on Korean history since that time. Those wishing for a survey history of Korean history will now find works available that better reflect more recent scholarship and insights. Pratt's ""Everlasting Flower"" and Seth's ""Concise History of Korea"" for premodern history and Robinson's ""Korea's Twentieth Century Odyssey"" for modern history come to mind."
1,What I Never Get,Is why the moral majority or cultural conservatives don't seem to get that capitalism is designed to slash and burn traditions. Their allegiance to Capital entails a self contradiction the Republican Party for one thing worries about.
5,Insightful and eye-opening,"This book really opened my eyes to the back-door politics that has been taking place over the last 40 years orchestrated by the liberal elite to make ""evil"" seem ""normal."" With a well-planned marketing strategy the liberal elite have taken over the media and bombarded us with images and propaganda, desensitizing a whole generation of people to immorality, and crushing dissent by labeling the opposition ""bigots"" and ""hatemongerers."" I highly recommend this well-written analysis of the marketing of evil."
1,Evil Markets,Great! A book on the evils of the free market by those who worship at the alter of the free market. 17 magazine bad ...Exxon Mobile good. Very funny read. I strongly suggest this book for those with conflicted ideologies that need further warping.
1,Conspiracy Theory Dressed Up As Sociology,"The notion that the virtue and wisdom of the people have somehow been insidiously subverted by a few Eeeevil Corporations is generally associated with the loony left, but it has its adherents on the right as well. The book papers over, but never addresses the fundamental problem with this notion -- how do the mysterious Illuminati cause people to accept their ideas if they are so utterly foreign to the people's beliefs?If the ""Marketers of Evil"" really have the mystical powers ascribed to them in this book, I have a modest proposal -- you whip up an ad campaign to convince Islamic radicals to start waving American flags and making friends with the Jews, and we'll let bygones by bygones on that whole business of converting America from Godly Righteousness to The New Babylon."
1,Feeble nonsense,"It's amazing that this kind of nonsense gets written, let alone published, in an 'advanced' society like the USA. Its primitive, paranoid style sheds a good deal of heat, but precious little light. Abortion and gay rights as liberal conspiracies? give us a break!"
1,If your a far right neo-wacko like the writer you will love it,"Of course, if your a REAL AMERICAN,you need to read this book so you can catch a glimpse of the evil republican/fascist/phoney christian monster that has consumed the republican party and wants all of us to be goostepping down the street singing ""onward christian soldiers"". This book should be read by all REAL AMERICANS to see just what these evil traiters have in mind if they ever gain control of the country. Think Taliban with 10,000 nuclear weapons. With a nice dose of Hitler's Germany thrown in for good measure. This book captures all of this and more in spades."
5,OUTSTANDING READING,This book really is a must read if you want to get a real inside look on how this country is being destroyed by radicals.
5,Time to openour eyes,This book gives great insight into what is happening in our country today. It is important to understand why this is happening so that we who care can do something to stop the decline of our country. Thanks for all the insight.
5,Must Read!!!,"Finally, someone has seen fit to be honest with the American public about the manipulations we are fed on a daily basis."
1,Not for Americans,"Although this book is well organized and, generally well written, it is not a good course for the American woodworker. The book is written by a Welchman. He uses species of wood and walking stick designs that are Welch. There are some good ideas about the process. But the book is very narrow in scope."
4,A well written story,"it seems to me that the story was written to be a follow-up to his first story arc secrets of power. The characters seem to have developed and grown between the stories. It was nice to see a shadowrun author "" stretch"" out a story and show a different side of the characters. Hope he writes another story to continue the past four."
4,A real insight into the ork underground,"I must admit that i am somewhat biased about this book because i love orks and orc culture. I loved the whole book except the ending, kinda weak. still i love everything shadowrun so all n'all not a bad book. hell, charette set the whole thing off anyway huh ? how bad could it be ?"
3,Cool&Quick action,A cool tale about an average runner trying to stay alive. A good story all around.
5,!!! BEST CHRISTIAN METAL EVER !!!,THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTIAN METAL EVER RELEASED ALBUM!!!KILLER VOICE AND SPEED WELL DONE ALBUM!!!IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
1,Delivery not received,I'd be really happy if Amazon would send this item so I CAN review it.Hopefully this might get the message across which is otherwise very hard to do.
5,Tracks,"Tracks Are:1. 2112 (Overture,The Temples Of Syrinx, Discovery,Presentation,Oracle:The Dream,Soliloquy,Grand Finale)2. A Passage To Bangkok3. The Twilight Zone4. Lessons5. Tears6. Something For Nothing"
1,Surround DVD will not play on several Sony Bluray players,"i am on my second copy of this dvd and it turns out it will not work on several sony bluray players.first i tried it in my sony bdp-s360 and it would not load at all. in fact it kept freezing the player so i would have to unplug it just to eject the disc.so i tried it on my older sony bdp-s350 unit. the disc would load and even let me select the DTS-HD or 5.1 surround sound section. but when the disc plays it is only in regular stereo, not surround sound. if i stop the disc to try and change the audio, it also freezes the player.i returned the disc believing that is was defective. now i am on my second disc and the status is the same on both bluray players. i updated the firmware on both players also and no change.so i paid a lot of money for a disc i can not listen to the way it was meant to be heard (in surround sound)"
3,Rush is great,This CD doesn't sound as clear as my older (original release) CD. It sound/seems washed out IMHO. It doesn't matter how I tune my player.
2,Didn't really Like It ! concept album???????,"This is definitely not the very best of Rush albums particularly after you have listened to Moving Pictures or Exit stage left. Also,this is supposed to be a concept album. A piece of suggestion to my friend in the review section (ssbl@geocities.com) as he has asked for it.Why not try concept albums by Jethro tull. eg 1.Aqualung 2.Thick as a Brick 3.A passion Play 4. Minstrel in the Gallery in particular and most other 60's and 70's albums by Jethrotull and you will appreciate what it means to make a concept album.Also you could try albums by King Crimson eg 1.In the court of King Crimson 2.lizard. After listening to the above albums you will understand how shoddy this album is."
3,Good but not great,"3 1/2A very decently ambitious classic progressive rock album in my opinion, but largely overrated as one of the flagpoints in the genre. Probably unnecessarily elevated for it's conceptual arch and epic introduction suite, 2112 is still a worthwhile investment for those dabbling in prog via classic rock. The emphasis however does not lie in complex melodic manipulations and challenging time signatures but in fluid, unpretentious rock and roll with a slightly nerdier angle, undoubtedly ""enhanced"" with these acquired high pitched, in tune shrieks."
5,2112 is here in 2009!,This album made in 76 is a classichard rock melodic album & deservesmore attention. It's Rush's best inmy opinion & I'm not big fan. I wasa fan until after the live album thenit got too progressive for me. Thiswas just a brilliant piece of work& if listen closely to the words it'sfunny it rings true to what has happenedto the government is trying to do nowwhich is they control everything for us.I use to listen to this & wonder howthey came up with this but I guess beinga teenager I just didn't understand butnow I really get it. If you never heardthis or don't like as some said you needto take a listen. This is a masterpiece!
3,not a great mix.,"The song selection for this is very good and does an aboveaverage job representing this era of RUSH.The performances are,as usual for RUSH, nearly flawless. It's also impressive howthey can reproduce these songs live; they sound almost identicalto their studio originals. It's also, in a way, kind of dull, forthe studio versions of these songs are perfect, in sound and pro-duction. My main problem with this album is the mix; the bassguitar is too loud and LIFESON'S guitar is not nearly loud e-nough! I don't consider this album as an essential RUSH album.One is better off sticking with the studio albums!"
5,The best live album I've ever heard,"As a whole I really enjoy live albums no matter who the artist. This is definitely no exception. This is definitely my favorite live release and the best of Rush's four live albums. It includes many of the band's greatest and best known songs and the versions are even better than the studio counterparts. The sound that the three men produce is breathtaking. The drum solo on YYZ is indescribable. Neil Peart has got to be one of the best rock drummers alive. Other standout renditions IMO are Red Barchetta, Xanadu, Jacob's Ladder, and La Villa Strangiato. There isn't a bad track on the entire album. If there is one indispensible Rush album, this is it."
3,Alert!! European version has more songs.,"Mary's ""Love & Life"" is a return to form, shall we say, since P. Diddy (who was once Puff Daddy) crafted her first two, now-classic albums. The magic has worn off, however, as some of the beats are somewhat stale and hollow and the lyrics rarely rise above pedestrian. All props and love to Mary, however, who still sings second to none, and has found much-deserved happiness in her life. Buyer beware, however, because the U.K. version of this album contains two songs not on the U.S. version: ""Didn't Mean"" and ""If I Don't Love You This Way."" .."
2,"Womp, Womp!","This album is such a huge disappointment! I thought No More Drama was bad, but Love & Life definitely gets the award for 'Worst Mary J abulms' hands down! At least No More Drama ended on a good note with a few nice songs. This one did not! I am a die hard fan so that's why I couldn't even disrespect Mary's efforts with 1 star...although that's what it deserved. Even though her vocals aren't the best, she's always moved me with her raw raspy sound...but on this album she just sounds horrible! She's trying to display her vocal growth and instead she's sounding overdramatic and tired! Go back to the drawing board on this one Mary! She lacks creativity on this album also. I would not recommend this one to true fans of Mary's talents and not her name. There are a few guest appearances that make a few songs tolerable. Other than that it's whack!"
2,No More Garbage,"Totally agree. This CD was g-a-r-b-a-g-e. I think Mary was trying to mend fences with Puffy. A testament that she is not the out of control diva people have always tried to claim. However, after this she'll probably be a bit more business savvy. Giving Puffy the reigns was a major mistake.Don't get me wrong. Puffy's strong suit is remixes. Should Mary ever decide to do a remix anthology of all her solo joints and featured appearances over the past 15 years - CALL DIDDY GIRL! He'll give those tracks the hookups they need. Otherwise, he should never be allowed in any studio during the creative process with real musicians. He's best adding a dash of flavor afterwards; usually biting a slamming 80's sample.Anyways all the great singers - except Chaka Khan - have had a few bad albums that were commercial failures and/or lacked any serious material worthy of radio airplay.Love and life. Live and learn."
4,Great CD,"This is her best CD since My Life. Puffy brought back that old feeling we got from that CD. The stuff Mary has done since My Life have been good, but not the Mary we know and love from her first two albums. People love to hate Puffy, but Mary does her best work when she hooks up with him, and she knows that."
4,THANK YOU,"Thank you mary j. for returning full time to hip hop/r&b the way you helped start it. puffy's production is phat! while sampling Barry White, Atlantic Starr, and Bohannon puffy's production always remains fresh. check out tracks like ""OOH"", ""WILLING & WAITING"", ""LOVE @ 1ST SIGHT"", and the Dr. Dre produced ""NOT TODAY"" featuring Eve blazing a fierce rap. the questionable interlude from Jay-Z. at the beginning is the downfall of the cd. it should have been on Beyonce's cd! however, this cd is just what Mary has always been about. there aren't very many ballads but the emotional ""Special part of me"" is the standout. By the way, Mary's voice sounds particulary better than it has on her last two cds! all hail.............the queen of hip-hop soul."
2,2.5 slightly better than Average but stuck in a time warp,"Mary J.Bliege got back with Puffy&While this Set for Me is better than Her past few Albums it still comes across SOunding like ""What's the 411"" Outtakes from 92 in so many ways.this Album by Mary puts me in the frame of mind of Michael Jackson's ""Invincible"" in that certain tracks sounded&felt 10 years Old&while it has a charm to it in some places for it to represent a Disc for 65-70 percent of the time it ain't working for me.this Album is slgihtly above Average but Mary screams too much for me&just seems to be trying to get Her Music Considered ""DOWN"" again more than anything else to me.She got too Polished with other Producers&Writers.but one thing you gotta know is that while you can take elements of the past you just can't ever bring that back fully again."
3,All the songs on Love and Life sound the same,"The only songs that stand out on Love and Life are ""When We,"" ""Not Today,"" and ""Love @ 1st Sight."" Mary J. Blige has a good voice, but these songs are atrocious."
3,Not No More Drama...........,"I Love Mary, and her cd is good, but it could have been a lot better. So hopefully she will re-do this album just like she did No More Drama and add a couple more good songs so that the album would be worth buying, because lets face it this isn't her best at all."
2,Mary should have not rejoined with P.Diddy,Sometimes it is not a good idea to return to your first love. This is a prime example. Mary has grown too much and this cd is a step backwards. The material seems more suited for Faith Evans and she would have handled it better also. This is the poorest Mary set let.
3,Just to make it short....,"I love Mary, and after this record was released i lost hope in her returning to Queen status. ""Mary"" was her last great record and I have been disappointed since. Best records are ""Not Today"" (new single..not a coinceidence) and ""All My Love"". I mean think about it...she dropped 3 singles in the matter of 3 months, 2 of those were before the album dropped. I'm done with Mary or I can say...""It's A Wrap!"""
1,I just don't like it.,"I always hear this thing about the great musicianship of all these progressive rock/Jazz fusion bands and it all sounds like decadent self-indulgent garbage. Strange time signatures, eastern riffs ... ooh, ahh ... big deal. This doesn't move me, this stuff is for those who play too much D&D. P.S. This is what PMG has become."
3,hav'nt read it yet,"Hi, I am a big fan of Gundam Wing and anticipate the arival of Moble Suit Gundam on cartoon network. I love the series and I'm reading a different book by Yoshiyuki Tomino. I hope this one will be as good as others say it is."
2,Disappointing,"Being a new fan of the Gundam anime, and unable to track down copies of Tomino's novels, I was very keen to pick up this title which purports to credit him as the author, when in fact he has no actual contribution to this book other than the basic ideas. I was further disappointed to find that it's not actually a novel, but is black & white line art in the usual manga style which, while it attracts legions of fans, doesn't particularly appeal to me. It can be tricky to follow and often requires a huge leap of imagination to fill in the gaps between frames and the half empty dialogue bubbles. I can only take so much 'What....', 'How....', 'Hhffff.....' etc, before I become annoyed at the lack of more substantial dialogue. As for the characters in the story, they're pretty much rehashes of figures from the anime canon so they're adding nothing new in terms of background or depth to the Gundam universe. Unless you're a big manga fan, I recommend saving your hard-earned cash for the anime."
5,See for yourself :),"This book for children is beyond brilliant. I think that this series is such a welcome collection for my daughter's bookshelf. The information is not just kids-stuff, but any adult lacking such general knowledge of the eyes and ears (not in a belittling sense) could also enjoy this book.We have several from the series - all are worth a go. Look at the great price and education offered, it would be hard to go wrong."
2,Disappointing,"The music on this set was as always great. However, I purchased this set for my husband Christmas and we were both very disappointed in the blue-musicray comic strip. We were expecting to see a music video of the band in concert. Very disappointing!"
5,Great quality reissue,"This is not as good of an album as Moving pictures, but is a really fun album to revisit. If you ever liked this album try it in 5.1 HI RES PCM on Blu Ray"
3,Another blown opportunity,"Should you buy this? It depends. Do you already own 2112 on vinyl? Then no you don't need this. Do you not have a copy of 2112? Then you should buy this. It's a beautiful, crisp stereo recording.But, if you were hoping to have your world rocked by a phenomenal surround-sound experience, go buy something mixed by Steven Wilson. Because this is the lamest, most timid use of 5.1 since the last Rush 5.1 debacle (Snakes & Arrows)."
4,A good start,"This book as a lot of good information and illustrations. It would be nice if the illustrations were all in color and more detailed, though. Some good information about material sources is included."
1,Unsophisticated and Misguided,"This book was a huge disappointment. The author does not appear to have any previous background on this dynamic industry. This book is not even suitable for a primer as much of Ms. Stone's analysis is not accurate. Having worked for the company, I can attest to the fact that its history is not as simple as portrayed in the book. Stone seems bent on proving that Ellison - despite his rock star ego - is the epitome of a true leader."
5,What can you say about such a classic? Six stars.,"I just put this on again a few weeks ago through my new B.I.C. Venturi speakers, and could not believe the sound. This production job is incredibly warm and clear, and compliments the playing and writing to a tee. ""The Camera Eye"" is Rush's best song ever--bar none. YYZ, Red Barchetta, Limelight, and Witch Hunt are also among their best. The whole album smokes with the proper intensity of a rock band not just ""on top of"", but annihilating, their game. One of the most amazing albums EVER recorded. Enough said."
5,One of the greatest,"Just letting you know, I messed up, this review is supposed to be for 2112. Sorry.I'm not too big of a classic-rocker, but you just cannot disregard Rush as one of the best, EVER. I've always kind of known about them and aknowledged their existence, but never really cared about them until someone said I might like Rush if I was a Coheed and Cambria fan. So I decided to check them out, and the inspiration is definitely there, and it's very obvious. Though Claudio Sanchez claims they'd never listened to Rush before, it's very curious as to how similar they are. Anyway, back to Rush. The epic song ""2112"" is one of the greatest to ever be recorded to a compact disc, or anything else. Wait, the whole cd is just amazing. Buy no matter what your interests are, you should be able to respect these guys immensely."
1,One must put up barriers...,"...to protect oneself from the Pearts and Portnoys of this world. Only buy this album for the ""great drumming"" if you like your drumming busy and soulless."
3,I doubt,"I purchased DVD-AUDIO versionI am very disappointed and I have lot of complain this1, not clear each instrument sound and very fuzzy on surround sonudwhere is guitar , where is bass , where is drum and also keyboards where2, bass sound is not clear , sometime I can't hear it3, ""Camera Eye"" was not original trackGeddy's singing was not original that's truly alternate and no echo treatmentThis is failure example to 5.1 surround remixCD was same as previous released remaster version I thinkno remaster at this time"
5,Essential for everyone,"""Moving Pictures"" is the perfect marriage of accessibility and intellect. With such classics as ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"", you're sure to hear a familiar riff or two upon popping this album in. What gives Rush songs such staying power, however, is the pure talent. Instead of just a big riff and showy vocals (the only things bands like AC DC ever really had to offer), Rush creates an entire soundscape, full of complex rhythms and great textures. The fact that I (primarly and emo/post hardcore fan) can not only enjoy, but also rock out to, these songs 20 years after they came out says a lot about Rush's capability as songwriters. This is hard rock for the thinkers and those that just enjoy exciting music. Looking at some of the more exciting bands of the last decade, such as Sunny Day Real Estate, and seeing how much they owe directly to Rush is a true testament to their talent, and this album probably shows them at their peak."
3,Buyer Beware,"I have an older SACD/DVD-A player and it will not play the 5.1 surround mix of the LP tracks. It does play the 5.1 surround tracks that accompany the video. I had this problem on all of the Talking Heads Surround Dual Discs and was told that it is due to the age of the player and the logic inside of it. All surround tracks do play on a newer DVD-A player so it is not a faulty disc. Most of the other DVD-A titles I have recently bought (Genesis Early Years Box) play just fine so it is hit or miss, I guess. This is just an FYI if you have an older player."
1,"SHOULD NOT BE LABELLED ""RE-MASTERED""",Was very disappointed to find out that this was a RE-PRINT and not a RE-MASTER. Feels like I've been had!
3,A good prog-rock album,"All the Rush elements are here = large, progressive rock song structures, Geddy lee's unmistakeable yowl and Neil peart's rather pretentious lyrics. This album contains some of Rush's best known songs, like 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Limelight'. This is quite a good album, with good musicianship by all members of Rush, and I respect it at that level. But this album doesn't appeal to me all that much for two reasons : 1. The drawn out progressive rock song structures, which get quite tiresome and 2. Neil Peart's annoyingly pretentious and pseudo-intellectual lyrics. If your a fan of prog-rock, this is definetly the album for you. But for me, this was a listening experience that left me, ultimately, unfulfilled. Still though, 'Tom Sawyer' IS a brilliant song."
4,Classic,Classic album. What drummer hasn't put on a set of headphones and tried to tackle what Neil Peart has done on this album?
1,Terrible DVD-A mix,"I purchased this in hopes of hearing this wonderful album in 5.1 surround sound and what I wound up hearing was lots of reverb. I checked my receiver settings, all was well, set to Straight (no dsp effects turned on) and still, that damn reverb was there. Why? Simple. No 5.1 surround mix was ever done. the ""audio engineer"" simply processed the stereo mix through a dsp to create the illusion of a surround sound mix. It's just plain awful."
5,Creative Brilliance,"Moving Pictures is the album where Rush really solidified their standing as tremendous songwriters. I've listened to Tom Sawyer hundreds of times, but I still get a chill when I hear that growling synth opening. This collection of songs represents Rush at their creative peak, and fortunately for all of us Rush fans, they're not done yet."
2,This wasn't the solution I was looking for.,"I bought this watch to count my steps so that I'd have a better idea of my activity during the day. The problem is that if I sit down at my desk, it will sense that I'm not being active and turn the counter off. That's not really helpful.Also, the display is very, very confusing. You have to cycle through 20 different screens to find the one you want. I keep the manual on the kitchen counter because I have to read the complicated directions every time I want to make any changes. All in all, I wasn't very happy with this product."
2,Disappointed with the step counter,I bought this product hoping it would accumulate the steps/day to motivate me to walk more. It was a bummer to see after I've started the pedometer steps that it would go into sleep mode and that all the steps were not counted. You have to hit start button after sitting down from driving or when at rest to start the count again. It became a bigger nuisance and high maintenance to keep checking if it was not tabulating or not! At night it would chirp intermittedly and hard to follow the instructions to turn that feature off. I'm going for an Omron as recommended by friends instead!
1,Not the best,"After 3 months of use the vac started to fall apart. Thank God for duct tape!! The hose continuously falls out of the canister. And the hose has pulled apart from the nozzle that connects to the wand. The suction is really good only if the bag is brand new. It's heavy and bulky. If you really want to waste your hard earned money, this is the vac for you."
1,Broke after 1 year,"I must say, I loved this vacuum when I first purchased it. It was a little heavy, but it had excellent suction. If I had reviewed it when I first purchased it, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars... Over time, it lost suction. About a week ago, the hose came apart from the handle and wouldn't stay in, so I kept having to push it back in. This morning I tried to turn it on, and now it won't work at all... I checked a couple different outlets, but it wasn't an outlet problem, it's the vacuum. It comes with a one year warranty, but that ran out about 2 weeks ago. Very frustrating! Money down the drain. For this amount of money, a vacuum should last longer than 1 year."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this vacuum a few days ago. Amazon shipped really fast. After I put the vacuum cleaner together, I discovered that the hose was really hard to disconnect from the wand. So today I am sending it back."
2,Took this one back,"Like a previous reviewer, I did not like the high-frequency motor whine. I asked customer service for noise level information and they replied with ""We don't have that information..."" Called Hoover Corporate and left a message for the Safety Officer requesting noise levels and an octave band analysis (to determine the frequency of the whine). That was early Nov and still no response.The Hoover does a good job and has a very strong motor (hence the whine) but cheesey attachments. I also did not like the short cord and the location of the on/off button which is very easy to confuse with the cord return button. At the very least the buttons should be of different color. Somehow, I expected more from Hoover product engineering!I returned the vac and purchased the canister recommended by a leading consumer product source as the ""Best Buy."""
2,Dissapointing,"I bought this since it had good reviews. The part of the hose that attaches to the body of the canister is quite flimsy and can rip apart easily. Also, the base (the rectangular part that sweeps the floors) is quite heavy. So it does become a chore to move it back and forth."
1,Complete Junk,"I purchased a refurb from Allergy Be Gone through Amazon. The power floor attachment would not stay on the very first day. It would come off at the slightest touch of an object. Worse yet, the hose came apart (tore) from the rubber flange, making the thing completely useless. I bought it for my vacation home and used it three, yes count them, three times total. After the first vacuuming, the power floor attachment had to be duct taped to stay on. The third time I used it, the canister tipped over and when I uprighted it, I found the hose broke. What JUNK! DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE!!!!"
1,Not worth the $$$,"After the hose on my Kenmore broke, I picked up one of these locally. (It was somewhat of an emergency having 2 dogs, 2 cats and 4 kids :P) I really wish I had just waited for the Kenmore hose to come in...the Hoover S3590 was a waste of money and does not work well on pet hair. It also does not perform well on hard surfaces and floors. The attachments were a joke!I would definitely not recommend purchasing this unit...save up the money and buy a Kenmore! :)"
2,Duros isn't durable!,"After a year and a half of light use I have had to repair the main hose and connections to the power brush. There have been months when the bags for it haven't been available and we've had to use our other lightweight vacuum instead.We bought this vacuum cleaner to clean the stairs and the loft level of our house. Our main vacuum cleaner is a Hoover Windtunnel self-propelled upright model; the Duros isn't as efficient as that, but it does a satisfactory job of cleaning low carpet and hardwood floors. The tools are a nuisance as they constantly fall off the machine, but, apart from its durability, the main complaint we have is the noise. It has a high pitched screech I've been unable to tame - drives my wife nuts!"
5,Good product,I have been using this product for a month and I am satisfied with it. Shipping and everything was fine.
4,liked it so much that i bought another one,"i love this little vacuum. we have 2 cats and a 95lb yellow lab that shed all over the house. we have hardwood floors and area rugs so hair and lint are everywhere. this vacuum does a good job on both the rugs and the bare floors. almost all of the rugs have fringe and i can turn off the rotating brush bar so that the vacuum doesn't eat the finge the way my old one did. the head of the vacuum is thin enough to get under almost any piece of furniture to seek out those dust/hair bunnies. we have a vacation spot at the beach where our pets go with us; at that house i have the addition of sand to the floor mix. so i bought a second one for that house. works great on that mess, too! my only complaint and the reason that i didn't give it 5 stars is that i have a hard time finding the bags. i have to order them from [...]. other than that, it's great."
1,"When your head's on fire, the book ""Feeling Good"" is only going to make you feel worse.","This book was a great read--when I wasn't depressed or anxious. In fact, I recommended it to my clients all the time. I even attended a great workshop by David Burns, who--by the way--is a fantastic presenter.The problem is that the book was useless when I was suffering from severe anxiety and depression. I'm not knocking cognitive therapy. It's highly effective--as long as a person's prefrontal cortex is working. But when your body aches, you can't eat or sleep, and you wonder how you'll get through another minute without ripping your skin off, this book is not going to help you. What I found more helpful was Claire Weekes' classic ""Hope and Help for Your Nerves."" It's a funny little book, written by a wise Australian doctor a long time ago. It's still the best book out there for people suffering with despair. Save Feeling Good for when you're feeling good enough to focus on it!"
4,It Works If You Work It,"This is a workbook that deals with depression and anxiety. It strives to change the way you think, and if you are in fact depressed or anxious, that's probably a good idea. However, you MUST do the exercises in order to experience any change. I'm on chapter 5 now, and have found it insightful and useful, but it is not a quick fix. However, I do think it is quite helpful with or without a therapist and a whole lot better than simply popping a pill."
1,The Feeling Good Handbook,"The book was recommened by our marriage counselor for dealing with our communication and marital issues. However the book dealt mainly with how to deal with depression - only one chapter on communication-which was very basic common sense information and some excercies that were juvenile and won't work when the parties aren't speaking. After reading, the book it should only be used if someone is very young and not used to understanding themselves and experiencing temporary mild depression in regard to a specific issue (such as dealing with minor social problems at school or work) and not by someone who is experiencing moderate to severe depression or in our case to address communication and marital issues. I would not recommend this book."
5,Wonderful Self Help Book,I suffer from mild to moderate social anxiety and depression and have for my entire life. Recently my anxiety has increased to a point that I was going to start taking medication again. I really dislike all the side effects of the medication and as a last resort researched the web for natural anti anxiety solutions that do not have these horrible side effects. While doing this I found many positive references to the Feeling Good Hand Book so I thought what could I lose and bought the book. I have been using the book for a little over a month now and I have easily reduced my anxiety from moderate to mild during that time. I am certain in the next six months I will be able to reduce it by as much again. I can not speak for others but for someone with mild to moderate anxiety and depression do not hesitate and start feeling better soon. Buy the book.
3,Qualifies for Antique License Plates,"The author states that he realizes that much of the book needs major revision but he won't be able to get to it until about 2012, after he gets out the other volumes in the set. I hope he makes it! The algorithms are detailed and timeless, but they are presented in MIX assembly language, which Knuth has obsoleted in favor of MMIX, a 64 bit RISC version. If you want a book on algorithms expressed in a rather mathematical style and agree with Knuth that it's a good idea to code them in assembly language so you can see exactly how they are computed, then this may be the book for you. However, I'd recommend spending half an hour browsing the book before making a decision to buy."
1,Looks impressive on my shelf,"The pure mathematician, they say, takes pride in things that have no practical application whatever. If the author had been more programmer and less mathematician he may have presented his algorithms in C. But, you see Ducky, that would have reduced the ""bible"" to a cookbook."
4,Harry Bosch is a force to be reckoned with.,"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main characters are saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."
5,Harry Hits Again,"Although Connelly has moved to a mansion in Tampa, FL he still knows LA and still writes like a smack up the side of the head with a .45"
4,Bosch Rules,"Love all of Michael Connelly's books, but the Harry Bosch series are the best. Echo Park is not the best in the series but it helps you get to know Harry."
4,"The Deep, Dark Woods","I enjoyed this book and vividly remember the scenes in the woods, and I especially remember thinking, ""Don't go there, Harry! Don't do this!"" I was right. But I felt a bit disappointed that Connelly allowed Harry to do something that just didn't seem in character. Parts of this book seemed slow and just a bit contrived, with all the driving back and forth through various neighborhoods. Nevertheless, any Harry Bosch novel contains depth and complexity, with a determined hero, and it's the depth, complexity, and determination which, along with the plot, make the books enjoyable."
4,Audio book held my attention.,I enjoy Michael Connelly. Some of his books are better than others but so far I have found them all enjoyable. Good escapist listening.
5,Great story,I keep coming back to Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels because the storylines are so well developed--they twist and turn and never lead you directly to the end. Wonderful storyteller set in a background of the LAPD.
5,Wonderful & easy! GREAT value and ready to use!,"This machine is so easy to use! Just pop it out of the box, unfold the handle, untape a couple of things, fill the tanks and voila! Like the other reviewers, I did experience problems at first with the machine not suctioning well. I just had to pop off the holding tank and pop it back on again and it worked just wonderfully. Great bargain for the money. ANYBODY will really love this carpet cleaner. I did my entire house in a couple hours and the carpets look great."
4,Very Happy With Purchase,"We have used the cleaner in 4 rooms and have been impressed with the results. We previously had a Bissel brand carpet cleaner for about 4 years and I think the Hoover extracts more dirt from the carpet. We have a wool carpet and the Hoover seemed to lift less carpet fiber than the Bissel.The hoover seems to have a better design to clean the rug cleaner as well, with removable brushes and a door on the front to get to the channel that the dirty water follows into the tank. I think it's important to clean the rug cleaner after each use since it could get clogged with dirt, hair, etc.Several other posts mentioned poor water extraction, but I found the water extraction was acceptable (e.g. carpet dry within 12-18 hours). The poor performance may be due to a see-through door on the front of the cleaner. You have to push firmly on the door to make sure it is closed (the door was partially open when it arrived)."
3,O K,"Cleans O K. Only problem is that the unit tends to leak a bit. The tanks are awkward to get off on on withour water getting on the floor. For the price, I would probably buy again."
5,WONDERFUL JOB!,"I received my cleaner early this morning and decided to clean my carpets. One tank cleans a big living room. I had to fill up about 5 times. My house smells so good. It did the job!If you are looking for something easy to use, get this. I am not patient enough when it comes to reading user manuals. This was so easy and fun!"
5,Very easy to use,"I purchased this item about a month ago to clean our 20 year old medium brown carpet. It really is very sturdy and easy to set up. Just vacuum first, mix up the cleaner with water (I put in a small teapot full of boiling water along with the tap water), and clean away. Water in the recovery tank is dark gray/black every time and easy to empty. Wipe the bottom areas of the cleaner with paper towel when you're done (remove and rinse the brushes if you have time) and put away.I've done sections of the house little by little because it is so easy to get out and clean a section even if you only have an hour to work with. I'm only 5'1'' tall and find it easy enough to push around. It is noisy so I use earplugs to save my hearing.The best thing is that we're saving a ton of money over hiring a company to do it for you. Buy the Hoover detergent from Amazon too! Great price and it arrived in 1-2 days."
5,Great cleaner!,I really like this cleaner! It did a very good job! I cleaned my carpet that hadn't been cleaned in quite a while and it looks great! I also used it for spot cleaning and it worked great! I did use some boiling water with the hot tap water that other reviewers had suggested. It is a lot lighter than the rentals and best of all I didn't have to hurry to get done and then schlep it back to the rental place!
5,"So easy, even my husband can use it . . . .","This has worked out very well for us, my husband complained about why we weren't paying somebody to clean the carpets, but once we got going, it worked great. We took other suggestions and used hot water from the stove and were very happy."
1,no suction,"My parents bought this cleaner a few years ago, and I've borrowed it a few times to clean my carpets. The tanks are easy to put on & remove, and my only complaint is that it has very little suction. I'm not an electronics idiot, and I read the manual, cleaned the lint screens, etc. It just doesn't have the suction to pick up the water. The brushes are agitating and I can see foamy water, but very little of it gets picked up. A gallon of clean hot water and solution goes into the tank, but only about 1/2 - 3/4 of a cup of dirty water is picked up.Once again I have very wet carpets with a fan blowing on them, hoping to cut the drying time. As I sit here regretting my decision to borrow their Hoover instead of renting a carpet cleaner I've decided to buy a cleaner myself, but will do a lot of research before deciding which one."
5,Great Vacuum!!,This is my first steam cleaner and it is very easy to use. I can't believe how dirty the water was after I was done. It works very well and I definitely recommend this product.
4,cleans your carpet well,I used this one to clean my carpet which had several layers of dirt. I am completely satisfied with the cleaning power
3,Just like a pet rock...worth every penny,Hasn't done me wrong yet. Works as expected. Not all that robust though.
2,Evolution as fact???,I was disappointed when I received this book I had purchased as a gift for my son's friend. The pictures are really cool and the ideas is great and yet I am returning it. After looking through it briefly I realized that it presents many scientific theories such as evolution as fact. It would be a great book if they stuck to the neat dinosaur information (that I was expecting) and left out the info on how the earth was formed and how apes turned into people.
5,Beautiful,When I heard Paris was coming out with a jewelry line i was ecstatic! I'm a big fan of Paris and when I saw what she had created I was mind blown. I decided to buy this piece and went through hell to have it shipped to Canada and when it finally arrived it was all worth it. I love this necklace it's absolutely gorgeous. I thought it would be bigger but I'm glad it's not because the cross is quite heavy. All in all this necklace is gorgeous and I wear it everyday!
3,A Bit of a Letdown,"The Picture Viewer itself is nice. It displays pictures in a size that works as long as you're not trying to show a lot of detail. The problem with the picture viewer is the software that comes with it. It sucks. The software appears to primarily be designed for Kodak cameras, not the picture viewer. It would be so much more convenient if you could just connect the picture viewer and access it like another drive. Instead you have to load on a bunch of software that you don't need, and the functionality to get the pictures downloaded to the viewer is neither user-friendly nor intuitive. We gave some as gifts and one of the them had to be returned because it just stopped working, and another one had compatibility problems with the system we loaded the software on. Great idea, poor usability."
2,Kodak Picture Viewer,The product was difficult to use. Pictures failed to stay in order and transferring them from computer to the viewer proved impossible for me. I must commend the seller though because he made every effort to help me solve my problems and then arranged for a refund when I was unable to conquer the product.
5,storyteller extraordinaire!,"Avoiding sensationalism, Ed O'Donnell provides a masterful account of the great disaster through a perfect combination of riveting detail, pathos, and shrewd analysis. The result is a story of tremendous tragedy that, even as it brought devastation and heartbreak, confirms the power of the bonds of love, family, and community. Although set in 1904, it offers a powerful message for today."
2,Not a well-written story,"I did have high expectations for ""The Shunning"" and I am quite interested in the Amish culture. But from the very first, I had to force myself into the book. It has no lure; it never really caught my attention. I wanted to find out what happened so I continued to read. But, in my opinion (and I think mine an educated opinion, I read all the time), the story is not well written. The characters never fully come alive. It's not truly believable. It's a lot like a serial story or TV show, where the author keeps one step ahead so you'll keep coming back even though the story is no good. That's how I felt about this book. It wasn't believable. I wouldn't read it again. And I don't want to read the sequels. If you want to read something, pick up some good literature -- not a cheap ""romance."" There is plenty to choose from out in the world of the written word."
5,All I can say is FANTASTIC!!!,"I bought this book recently (trying to get away from Vampires!), I loved it way more than I thought I would. I could not put it down. In fact, two days after I bought it, I had to get another by Beverly Lewis. I wasn't sure what was next for this but I knew that could not be the end. So I bought the Thorn and I love it just as much! Can't wait to get the others in!!!"
2,"Is this the ""never ending story?""","I selected this book because it focused on the Amish. The author, Beverly Lewis, did a good job of introducing the customs of these prayerful people. She developed the characters quite well but, when it came to finishing the story, I was disappointed. There were too many loose ends. This may be Lewis' technique for making you want to read her next book but I, for one, wanted to hear what happened to these characters. I did not want to be launched off into the nether world trying to guess what happened. Great way to sell the next book but disappointing when the book you have on hand doesn't finish."
2,Poorly written,"I just finished reading Ms. Lewis' Abraham's Daughters the 5 book series, which kept me reading as fast as i could and i give them 4.5 stars. I then went directly to ""The Shunning"" and how terribly disappointing it is. There is virtually no character development. I got a vague idea of the characters toward the last 1/4 of the book; the last 2 chapters really, and even then i wasn't sure. Katie's behavior is totally out of character for an Amishwoman, even a rebellious one, and it isn't even acceptable in the rest of the world.Not a well written book and not a very good sampling of Amish life. I say ""skip The Shunning"" and go for Abraham's Daughter. The middle couple books are a bit of a drag and should be condensed into a single book, but overall, much-much better than this one!"
1,NOT FOR A FAMILY WITH KIDS,"The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. This is a magazine lifestyle. You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table."
3,Real Simple means to organized home,"This book is lovely and has some excellent ideas. It you read the magazine, Real simple, most of the suggestions can be found there or on the web site. I wish I had some rooms (i.e.laundry) to organize. There are not many ideas that are adaptable to a smaller house/apartment living"
4,Insprirational.,"This book is good to look at for inspiration, but it's not very informative. Though, the pictures truly do make up for it."
4,Cute Book.,"I was expecting something different, perhaps a little more imagination. The illustrations are lovely and the rhymes are nice. Some of the subjects of counting aren't part of the modern family and can be explained. Overall, it is one of the best counting books I have seen."
4,In the flesh.,"Wow...I've never heard a live recording where the crowd whistles so much. Anyway, that's not important. Rush had just released their pivotal power-prog release 2112, which featured the phenomenal side-long title track based on the writings of Ayn Rand. And the highlight of this live release is, in my opinion, an awesomely energetic performance of that epic. Some parts are cut out, reducing the song to 16 minutes, but it still rocks, man. At this stage in their career, Rush was rockin' hard, evident with crushing cuts like ""Bastille Day,"" ""Something for Nothing,"" and ""Working Man,"" which has one of Lifeson's most exciting guitar solos to this day. The band also performs ""By-Tor and the Snow Dog,"" which features some sublime instrumentation in the middle. Neil Peart's drum solo is interesting and very musical...I mean, it's more than just a guy hitting stuff. This is a great live album from the days when Rush was young and gushing energy."
1,The worst live Rush album,"While the musicianship on this CD is awesome (as would be expected of Rush) the quality is awful. What bothers me is the production of this disc. It sounds like it was recorded in Gomer Pyle's barrocks. If you want live early Rush, then try ""Different Stages"". ""All The World"" is for die-hards only."
4,Nearly perfect,"Incredible album that reminds me of my distant youth. Still has the energy and brilliance that I remembered. Only thing is that there is a small skip in one of the songs. Not enough for me to take the trouble of repacking and sending it back and waiting for another. But, slightly bothersome nonetheless."
4,Not For Music Critics,"At this writing, this is out of print. That's a real shame, because there are some pieces in this that every Rush fan needs to hear. They feature an extended version of ""By-Tor and the Snow Dog"". With the extra feedback missing on the studio versions, it adds an eerie effect to the song. But the real highlights include ""Lakeside Park"", ""2112"", ""Something for Nothing"", ""What You're Doing"" (it's amusing to hear band members say as leaving the stage ""Man, oh man, I guess that's it!""), and the medley of ""Working Man"" and ""Finding My Way"" (can anyone knock Neil Peart's awesome drum solo here?).If you're wondering why I entitled this review ""Not For Music Critics"", it's because Rush is a band that's been unduly slagged by the critics. Those who can't become critics!"
1,Endlessly Boring,"This is one of the most God-awful books ever written. We read it for book club and it was highly rated by my fellow readers. Others raved about the book leading me to think perhaps I'd missed something so I rented the movie and watched it (or at least I tried). The movie was equally terrible. Not one word of the book or movie did a thing for me. Whatever the book had to offer was lost on me. I'm an author, therefore, I'd love to say something positive about Last Orders, but I can't think of a thing. Unbelievably boring!Cynthia Briggs"
2,The Beginning Of The End,If you grew up with Rush as I did in the 70's you know what a turning point this album was. Every album beginning with their self title debut RUSH through Signals were 4 or 5 star albums. Their distinct sound and creativity in their early years makes them one of the greatest rock bands in history. Unfortunately they succumbed to the influences of the 80's new wave rock beginning with this album marking the beginning of the end. If you are a hard core Rush fan like I am don't waste your time with this disappointing effort.
4,A Good First Album for Newbies,"Back in 1984, I purchased this Rush recording on vinyl album. I really liked the video for Distant Early Warning, so I decided to give Rush a try. After one complete listen-through of this album, I was hooked. From the complex and loud solo on Distant Early Warning, to the ""Police-ish"" sound of The Enemy Within, each song has it's own unique sound. The funky and jazzy sound of Red Lenses is the highlight of the album. Give this one a try; you will be hooked too!"
3,Once a Favorite 3 1/2 stars,"GRACE UNDER PRESSURE, was a one time my favorite RUSH cd. But over time, it has not stood up as well as their other cds. It comes across as light on the sound, not as musically dense as their other cds. At the time that was a nice change of pace. Still some good songs, Distant Early Warning, After Image, Red Sector A, Between the Wheels, and the Enemy Within. Worth checking out, and worth cranking up, more of a rock-n-roll cd for the group, without all the progrock trappings. Rush lite indeed."
4,NOT BAD FOR BEING PRESSURED,"I WOULD AGREE THAT GRACE IS NOT THEIR BEST WORK,BUT I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF IT's HARD EDGE.LIFESON'S GUITAR WORK IS TREMENDOUS,AS IS GEDDY AND NEIL'S.I GAVE IT 4 STARS,TAKING ONE AWAY FOR LACKLUSTER PRODUCTION.ALL IN ALL NOT A BAD CD."
5,Yet another example of Barbara's way with words!,"She doesn't always choose a predictable route or ending, but always believable. I find it so easy to hear the sounds, envision the views and feel the sorrow or joy. She certainly must have a vast resource list to describe so many of the scenarios that life can hand us. Here's to many years of stories yet to be told."
3,"Good writing, unique, but not my cup of tea","This was honestly the most depressing romance-genre novel I've ever read. It was an unusual premise. The children were awfully annoying. I don't care for children in my romance, but that's just me. The woman Jack loves is in a coma throughout the entire book. That's depressing enough but then we have to watch Jack deal with two daughters, one a teenager, etc. The part of the plot surrounding Jack painting again was excellent. Superb expression of colors and painting in writing. But overall the book fell flat for me on the romantic connection between Jack and his wife."
3,Introspective love affair,"This is a story about a divorced couple in Northern Califorina. The woman suffers from a coma from car accident and her former husband has to come back to take care of his daghters and the former wife. The plot moves slowly as Jack reviews his relationships and his priorities. A typical Californian dilemma, indeed."
5,Alabama Greatest Hits is Great,Love Alabama and was happy to find a DVD with segments of them performing. Wish they had some complete concerts available on DVD.
2,"yeccchh, p-tui","You know, I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon because I've bought (and liked) Loreena McKennitt albums, but this was just awful.There are one or two cuts that are kinda New Age-y and the rest of the album is schlocky violin music that's more like Mantovani than McKennitt.I realize most New Age music skates a fine line between ""muzak"" and music anyway, but this album falls on the wrong side of the line."
5,Simply the best!,"This is the best of all 3 of their CD's. If you like what you hear from the music clips, I promise you'll love the entire CD. Close your eyes as you listen and drift off to Ireland. Great for lowering the blood pressure and relieving stress."
5,Nothing can touch your soul the way this music does.,Absolutely beautiful. The compositions and the musicianship reach out and caress your spirit like no other. My favorite music of all time. I have them all.
4,Cute and sexy,"These shoes are great to add some spice to your most basic casual summer outfits. I bought the black sandals to replace some leather black flip-flops. My liesure dress is very relaxed and reserved, they fit w/ practically every outfit w/ a black motif. Plus, your bare legs will look fabulous, no matter your size. Although their comfy, I held back the 5th star because of the height, you can't run in them, :) Naughty Monkey has an new fan and customer."
1,AWFUL!,"A terrible printer. Quality is okay, but after only a few uses the paper would not feed. I was able to continue using it by carefully feeding the paper one sheet at a time. After a short while and only a dozen or so prints, the printer would display ""paper jam"" nearly every other time, which was a royal pain since you have to unplug for 5 seconds and then start everything over. I am now ready to throw it away. I would not waste my money on another Kodak printer."
1,very bad transaction,I PURCHASED THE PRINTER DOCK TRAY ONLY AND WHEN I RECIEVED IT IT WAS DAMAGED THE SELLER CHARGED ME 7.95 FOR SHIPPING AND IT COST 3.95 AND WAS VERY NASTY TO DEAL WITH. NEADLESS TO SAY I HAVE A BROKEN PRINTER TRAY AND I AM OUT 32 DOLLARS
2,"Great pictures, poor computer support","Pictures directly from my Easyshare V550 camera are terrific, no complaints. Trying to get pictures from my hard drive via EasyShare software has been futile. Have been in touch with Kodak Support but no solution to date."
1,Unsatisfied,I dislike the vendor I ordered this product from - ARNGMike. I never received it. I emailed ARNGMike and never heard back. Not good.
5,A Macro Delight,"I found this book clever, touching, and witty. It is a wonderful story of growing up in NYC, but it really could take place almost anywhere stateside. A great read!Norma Davidoff"
5,Fullmetal Last Three Episodes,"This story might start at the other side of the gate, but as this epic story of two brothers comes to an end you'll find out just how much they will sacrafice for each other. The final battle between homunculus and human draws to an end. It's a fight of all the homunculus vs. the Elric brothers, and the ending puts a twist on it you wouldn't even imagine. The ending of this tale, though sad, makes you long for more of the story. Don't worry though fans, because there's the movie after that!This disc contains episodes 49-51: 49- The Other Side of the Gate; 50- Death; 51- Laws and Promises."
5,What a treasure!,"Due South is an absolutely fantastic series that far too few Americans have ever seen. I don't think it it shown at all here at the moment, so finding it on DVD is a treat. For shear delight I would gladly give this six out of five stars.I do have a couple of complaints with the actual production of the DVDs, though. First, where's the Pilot?!!! There is enough empty space in the set that it could have been included. It would help explain what is going on in later episodes. Besides, I seem to remember that it was hilarious and I'd like to laugh at it again. Second, there has to be a better way of packaging the discs. Having two discs overlaid is extremely awkward, to say the least. For these reasons I gues I'll have to award this delightful set only five stars.Buy it."
1,Why spend over $100 when you can spend less than $3?,"Go to Marpacs website and listen to the samples of their sounds. Listen to the sounds for their most expensive machine 1288 for the sounds of nature and their white sound. [...]Now look up Joe Baker on the amazon website for mp3 downloads and listen to the sounds you can download to your computer by Joe Baker and you will find that his sound quality is much higher. The Ocean Waves are awesome and a .99 cent download, plus they have rain, mountain stream, and even ultrapure white noise for those who don't want a nature sound for less then a dollar each.After you download these to your computer, burn them to a cd. Use a Cd player in your room that has a repeat playback ability. My wife said that this really helped her since I snore at night. I hope this review saves you money and gets you a great night sleep for only a few dollars."
3,nice earrings....at first,I got the earings as a christmas present and wore them on a few occasions. One night i wore them to a friend's house and when i got home one of them was missing. I later found it on the ground. the metal clasp broke and now i can't wear them because it won't stay in. They bend VERY easily. I've just given up!!
3,Some good items included.,"The last time we were at the clarinet repair shop, we were told that only trained professionals should EVER attempt to oil clarinet keys, so the key oil is basically useless. The rest of the items in the pack were adequate but somewhat diasappointing. It was not an expensive kit and you get what you pay for."
1,A Pure Waste Of Time.....,"At first i disliked Hanson because of its radio play songs, but my sister convinced me to listen to whole album. Boy, was that a mistake. The lyrics flip between extremly childish, and in efforts to seem meaningful, where it makes the brothers look like they are trying too hard to be taken seriously. Each song seems to be written of the same basic idea, there is not too much variation on the album just a slowing or speeding up of the same melody. One star seems too good for this album, i would not wish it upon my worst enemy......"
3,"I'm not supposed to like Hanson, but....","I know, I know. I'm not supposed to like Hanson. It's trendy to hate Hanson just like it's trendy to hate Toto and the Spice Girls (nevermind that Toto is a GREAT band...the Spices on the other hand....). So what in the name of Steve Lukather am I doing writing a review for a Hanson record? I don't know, but it feels right..... I just found myself appreciating Hanson one day. Now don't get me wrong -- I know fully well that those kids aren't playing with that much conviction on that album (especially the 6 year old drummer), but whoever is playing those instruments is great. Truth be told, this album is a textbook lesson in good, slick pop production, and so what if it has the latest teen-sensation's name on it? I encourage musicians to check this album out. You'll be surprised. It's a LOT like early Jackson 5 when they had a pre-pubescent, pre-nose job Michael fronting the band. What ever happened to Germaine, anyway.....?"
3,Not to good!!!,Hanson is a band that has good harmonies and voices. But they're kinda dorky. The Backstreet Boys are WAY better. There are only a few good songs.
4,MMMBop to the Top,"This CD is very great. I know that sound juvenile, but it's just great. I love every song from the heart-wrenching ""With You in Your Dreams"" to the song recognized everywhere by its catchy melody mixed with the different lyrics ""MMMBop"". I got this album when I was 11 and I have always loved it."
1,THIS CD SUCKS A BIG ONE!!,THIS CD SUCKS. I BROKE THE SECOND DAY I HAD IT DELIBERATELY. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?
1,What can I say? Hanson stinks,"They don't even deserve a one star rating, so why do I bother? My 8 yr. old sister enjoyed driving me crazy by repeatedly playing the taunting lyrics of the songs. Sorry boys, but nasal singing, long hair, and MMMBOP is out. What in the world is MMMBOP anyways?"
5,HANSON ROCKS!!!!!!!!!,"Middle of Nowhere is absolutely wonderful. 13 tracks of pure passion and soul by three very talented brothers. It's a wonderful CD, and I highly recommend it."
5,This is a great dbut cd!,"Hanson are great! There music is fabulous! MMMBOP is not the only song on the CD and the rest are way better! I recommend buying it. Hanson has been out for 3 years, I have all their CDS and Middle of Nowhere is my fave (still)! P.S. It must be a good album if Rollingstone says it's one of the most essential albums of the '90S!"
5,"Hanson Rocks, And So Does Their C.D!","Looking for an awesome c.d that both kids, and adults will love? You've found it! The musical trio, Hanson, (Ike, Tay, and Zac), add new meaning to music on this C.D! Starting with their song, Thinkin' Of You, and ending with Man From Milwaukee, this c.d rocks the whole way through! Not only does it have its up-beat songs, it also has its slow, sensitive songs too! Tay's vocals add a lot to this c.d, and Ike and Zac's backgrounds make it a favorite of mine! Try It! You Wont Regret it!"
1,What the hell were these guys thinking?!,"This disc is not just bad, its REALLY bad. Im not one of those people who offend them because of what they look like, etc., its just that this music is crap. I might have liked it when i saw 7 years old, because the music and lyrics are dorky, and they scream ""teenybopper."" They should have titled this album ""Middle of Adolescent Nightmare."" To put it simply: dont buy it! Hanson has had their 15 mins of fame far too long, but maybe we'll see them someday on VH1's Teen Idols Special: ""bad Music of the 9O's."""
4,"Based on 50's and 60's Rock, Bubblegum, and Doowap","I have been listening to 50's and 60's music for a long time, and I appreciate artists like The Rascals, The Animals, and of course, The Association. Many of the songs on Middle of Nowhere have some roots from songs by artists mentioned above. I like Hanson and their music, but not an avid fanatic.For people who like grunge, devil-rock, heavy metal, and Alternative rockers, please, do not compare their music with music within another genre. It seems immature and inappropriate. Sure, their songs are either ballads, bubblegum and/or rock, it should be compared to Matchbox 20, Marylin Manson, nor Metallica.I would have rated the CD a 5, but some of the songs, I did not like, such as ""Yearbook""."
5,Pikachu's Global Adventure to My Heart =),I loved this prodict! It was a little beat up but that was what I was expecting. I couldn't put that book down <3 Came in the mail quickly and with no problems.
5,Apex Power Station A1,I recently received the Apex Power Station. The product was delivered quickly (within a few days of ordering) and although some of the nuts and bolts were loose in the box all the pieces were there. The instuctions were easy to follow and I was able to complete the assembly in about an hour. The machine is extremely well designed and sturdy with absolutly no wobble during use ( I have tried others)..feels like pro gym equipment!! The only very minor negative is they could have used a little more forgiving grip on the dip handles! Excellent overall!!
3,LEAN BACK WAS A GREAT COMEBACK BUT...,"Lean Back was a great song to come back on, but i really just should have bought the single. Now I am not going to get on here and write negative things about the artist and their music because i'm not going to knock their hustle,and i know that it wasn't a smooth rode getting this far. But i am going to say this, this album could have been much better and i do believe in second chances, so if they came out with another album, i would buy the album again."
2,true story-terror squad,"come on guys, im so suprised when i went out to purchase my copy of true story i was very excited because i had heard lean back an people had said that this wasn't the best track on the album..... how wrong they were it is the only good track on the album. There are so many folts on this album and one them includeds remy-ma. who the hell dose she think she is... she is on almost every track!!!!????!!!???There are only 2 good member of this albums version of the terror squad: tony sunshin he shines on pass away and streets of n.y! and of cource fat joe but they are both quite on the the album compared to remy who trys to stell the show. again why did they put remy on the whole album i just dont get it. There are only 1 or 2 songs where geddy comes on and he is better the remy i mean please come on.The reason i am giving this 2 star is manly because of remy who is just awful: 2 stars from me dissapointed!"
3,It's aight...,"No dis to TS, but they ain't been the same since Pun died and Cuban Link left. Considering this, they actually put out a decent album, 'specially since ""Lean Back"", though it was kind of cheezy, rocked the summer of 2004. Other than that and a few other tracks not needed (""Take Me Home"", ""Terror Era""), the album would've been much better. Instead of trying for the pop crossovers, as attempted on ""Streets of NY"", they should've just stuck to the harder beats like ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Me"" (where Tony Sunshine actually spits a verse, a nice one too), ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah"" (Remy Ma destroyed this track), and the harder ""Let Them Things Go"". On top of that, ""True Story""'s main focus only seems to be Fat Joe and Remy Ma instead of the whole group. If not for the attempted pop-crossovers and limited spots for the whole crew, it would've been muuuch better."
2,New Album...New Squad.,"I was a big fan of the 1st Terror Squad Album w/ Pun, Joe, Cuban Link,Triple Seis,Prospect and Armageaddon.The new Terror Squad w/ Joe, Remy, Tony Sunshine, Geddy and Prospect is a good album. It has some good tracks. The addition of Remy makes the cd worth pickin up. But its mostly Joe and Remy through out the cd. no one else gets a real chance to Shine like the 1st album. It should be a best of both worlds 3 the way that Joe and Remy take over the whole cd. Just not the same with out the origional line up."
4,Highly derivative...and I LOVE IT!!!,"Rush were still assimilating their influences when they made this album. I call this their Led Zeppelin ripoff period, but strangely enough, this is the one that I find in my CD player the most often.What can I say....it kicks...!!! ""Fly By Night"", ""In the End"", ""By-Tor & The Snow Dog""...all album radio classics. It all sounds a little dated now, but this is still the kind of music that makes adults drive fast and kids want to play guitar."
4,Sounds like Neil got new drums!,If you haven't heard the remastered version of this album then you are in for a real treat. Neil's drums sound awesome and it sounds almost like a whole new recording compared to the previous CD. Neil really shows that he is already the best drummer in rock and has been for a long time. The band really cut loose on this album and it shows with the aggressive playing. If you like this album and the first RUSH album then you need the remastered versions of these classic recordings. This is not Rush's best album but its still highly enjoyable and the sound clarity thanks to Bob Ludwig's remastering is a breath of fresh air.
5,Love Rush,What more can be said about these Canadian Rockers than that. Why do I have to use more words than that?
4,A great start prog album for Rush!,"After the 1974 debut 'Rush' album, Neil Peart joined the band and everything went topsy-turvy! No more Led Zeppelin ... stuff, but a sucessful dive into the world of progressive rock! It still has a reminicient aftertaste of 'Rush' but definately prog-wise. The first three tracks rock out well and ""By-Tor and the Snowdog"" is the best track on the album. The whole song it good and I like the way the songs tells about the story and the battle of By-Tor, the prince of darkness, and the noble Snowdog of the Overworld! Most people will recognize the track ""Fly By Night"" as a classic (so I don't need to talk about that one). After that, ""Rivendell"" is one of the only good songs. It shows the quiter side of Rush and a good song for all you Lord of the Rings fans. A must-have for people already somewhat familar with Rush."
2,Think again,"I was forced to read this for a psych course. It is a cozy book for those who do not want to stretch their mental wings. It completely ignores modern perception research and assumes a ""deep"" structure and surface structure for every problem.-what is the deep structure of a photon, is it a wave or particle?It is more appropriately a book of linguistic reasoning. It makes the common mistake of assuming the world is made of words and follows the same rules as the words.If interested in this type of reasoning I would recomend Korzybski's Science of Sanity. It not only shows how to use linguistic reasoning, but does so with a firm understanding of its limits."
4,Like being there all over again!,This book was very informative and really details what the Hedo vacation can be. The storys from the guests were very funny. I truly felt like I was back at Hedo while I was reading this book. I can't wait until my next Hedo vacation.
1,Don't Waste your money!!,"This movie was the worst movie I have seen in quite some time. I expected much more with the great cast of charactors. During the entire movie, the scenes were jumping back and forth from one part of the world to another. The camera scenes were continually jerky and very destracting, along with poor color. The plot was the generic drug cartel theme with no real excitement or action. I alomost left the movie theater but I kept thinking the movie would improve. It did'nt!! It was a real dissapointment and waste of money."
1,Don't Waist Your Money!!!,"I have no idea how on earth this movie won any oscars. Trafic is without doubt one of the worst movies ever made. No point, no action, no plot. Awfull movie."
1,Not impressed.,"I was just not impressed with this film. Maybe if I saw it before all the hype I would not have been disapointed, but frankly, I just did not enjoy it."
1,Azrael,This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time not even good enough for the b-movie films of yesteryear. Don't waste your time and or money on this.
1,Buy the DVD Version Instead,"I liked this movie. The cast was pretty good and the acting and story were also strong.The HD DVD sucks royally. The video quality is like a regular DVD. I saw this using an HDMI connection on a 1080 HDTV on which other HD DVDs have looked much better. High definition discs are still new and I expect it will take some time to improve the technology, but this movie is an exact replica of the DVD version.I bought this at Best Buy, on sale for almost the same price of the regular DVD. And it is definitely worth less than the regular DVD because I could at least watch a DVD on my blu-ray player when they become somewhat affordable in the distant future. This is why I like combo formats better than regular HD DVDs."
1,Racist-homophobic trash!,"Del Toro picks up one of the bad guys in a club with all men where intense dance music is playing. Then that man is tortured. Then he is tricked by an assassin. Finally, he ends up dying on his feet by two different murderers. It's bad enough that the gay Latino character has to be a villain, but he is gullible and subject at anytime to abuse as well. What does this say about the filmmakers' views on gay Latinos? We already know based upon ""Basic Instinct"" what Michael Douglas feels about lesbians. To top it off, the scene in which a black drug dealer prostitutes a white female high school student was racist and designed to scare the white fathers in the audience. I don't care if I get dismissed as PC, this movie was trash."
1,SNOREFEST 2001 ZZZZZzzzzzzzz..........,"If this bomb doesn't put youto sleep, you're already dead!With out a doubt, one of themost boring movies ever made!"
1,Horrid show,"PBS would have been far more entertaining and informative. By far, the worst Michael Douglas show ever. I am beginning to doubt the people who give ""awards."""
3,Interesting look at drugs,"""TRAFFIC"" is three interwoven stories about the drug trade and its impact on people. It attempts toshows how drugs can affect everybody connected to the drug dealers and pushers eg. family. It works in a way, but not enough to make me feel empathy for the characters.It's fast moving and engaging, but something is missing from this film. Big names like Zeta Jones and Douglas aren't enough to make the film great.If you really want to see a film that tackles the subject really well but in a different light, may I suggest ""Requiem for a Dream"". The devastation of drugs is well told in this film."
2,What's the big deal?,"Just another movie about drugs; selling them, doing them, etc. (Yawn.) What's with all the hype? Don't believe it's a ""must-see"" just because the ads and the critics say so. They are both bought very easily. The cast is good but how much entertainment value is there in watching a father lose his daughter to drugs and then to prositution? We can see that for free on Jerry Springer. And we are supposed to care about people who are so absolutely stupid? This film, just like real life gives you no reason to care about people who choose to be morons. This film makes you wonder if the producers and writers themselves were high. People on drugs should enjoy it though. It will support their dillusion that they are cool and a rebel. Unfortunately because of this film's success we can expect a dozen carbon-copies within the year. Remember when movies used to be a good experience?"
3,Save Your Money and Buy TRAFFIK (The Original),"As remakes go, this isn't a bad flick and there are entertaining parts. Unfortunately the quality acting takes place in smaller roles played by Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle (undercover narcotics officers in CA), and Benicio del Torre and Jacob Guzman (?) del Torre's sidekick in Mexico. They are in fact the only characters that live up to their counterparts in the original BBC Miniseries TRAFFIK. I would highly, highly recommend purchasing the TRAFFIK mini-series prior to buying this diluted version."
1,This film is so over-rated,"This film is not complex or interesting. It is an all-star, worthless mess. It is extremely annoying visually. Scenes in Mexico are YELLOW, while scenes in the USA are BLUE. Winner or several Oscars........Why? This is junk!"
1,"A dull, drawn out movie",This movie is only the second movie i have ever walked out on. there really isn't any plot. the scenes in mexico hurt your eyes because of the coloring. the show never ties anything together the only good thing about the show was Catherine Zeta-Jones. OVERRATED MOVIE OF THE YEAR!
4,"good, but...","This is a good movie. The movie tells the stories of different characters and families on the opposite sides of the drug war. The movie tells a comlex story in a very understandable manner. However; the story is not new. I think around 15 years ago, when I was still living in Montreal, BBC made a TV series with the same story line. The location has now been changed from London to Washington, from Pakistan to Mexico. I can still remember the series because it made a tremendous impression on me when it was first broadcasted. The way the BBC series was shot was more conventional, like a BBC series. It was very well done. The new movie now is shot with more updated technique. If I must chose between the two - I prefer the BBC series."
4,great Steven Soderberg film,Steven Soderberg gives a tale about drugs in America. He shifts around in many differnt views f people. Michael Douglas is great. Benicio Del Toro(The Pledge) did a great supporting job. It was much better than OUT OF SIGHT.
2,Not worth the time,"Traffic was a neat movie just because I live in Columbus, Oh and lived in Cincinnati, Oh. There are 3 stories going on in the movie, which eventually merge together, somewhat. I guess if you liked ""What lies beneth"" you will like this movie. But I think that the hype of 4 academy awards drew alot of people in to the theater, but Notice no academy awards for acting. Overall I am glad I didn't waste my time driving to a theater to see this film."
4,Good story,"The only problem i have with this film is that mexico is yellow and cleveland is blue. Its like cleveland is cleaner than mexico which is probably true, but not in the drug trade sense. a very dirty film of the high stakes of the drug wars; a war which will never be won unfortunately. After hearing that you probably think this film was a wasted effort, which is probably true, but at least there were some funny things with don cheadle and luis guzman."
3,unboxed?,"It looks fine but why unboxed? I was wondering if it is used, and I think there was a manual or recipe for the liquid?"
5,A great book for the student,"I enjoyed learning the new mantras with this book, as well as learning to make my own mandalas and yantras to help me concentrate better during meditation. There are many tools for the new as well as experienced Daka or Dakini."
4,"A Great Little, Black Book","A good size that fits easily in my bag, so that I can whip it out on the tube and scribble the journey away."
5,absolutely bittersweet,"blockhead first came to my attention with his nasty beats collaborating with aesop rock. i decided that maybe i should give his album a try and i bought it online. it may have just been one of the best instrumentals ever produced. all i have to say is that on this entire album, every track makes my heart want to burst. if you can understand that feeling when listening to music, you'll definitely appreciate blockhead's mellow bittersweet style."
2,OK starting point,"For adoptive parents who know nothing about life stories and how to present this information to their children then this book is a reasonable place to start. In my experience though, most parents have given considearable thought to the information that their children need and they would gain no further benefit from this book which contains very little information. I'm sure that this works well in the workshops that the book originated from but without that format, it does not really stand alone."
4,"Mostly ""hits"" and few ""misses","This collection of short stories have gotten mostly good reviews here, so I decided to buy a copy. I have to say I don't like all of them. A few or so short, I don't see the point in putting them in the book - but if you can overlook this, you do get some good stuff here. A lot of the characters in these stories are pretty flawed but you end up seeing yourself in a lot of them and in the end, can relate to them.""The Birthday Gift"" is hard to read, but it's dead on truthful. ""Merry Christmas"" is another painful one to get through, but I ended up reading it three times and ""Friends,"" the last story in the book is outstanding.Gross reminds me of Raymond Carver in a way - real life stories and to the point. He missed the target a few times, but all short story writers do from time to time, even Carver.It's a good read, well worth the ten bucks."
1,Please Remove This Product From Amazon,Please don't offer anything without a digital tuner if it's a VCR or a TV set on Amazon. These units are worthy only for donating to Goodwill.
3,A Bookend Album,"'Hemispheres' was a gateway album for Rush, closing out their prog-rock period and moving into a new and exciting artistic future. They don't make albums like this anymore, and even by 1978, hardly anyone was doing stuff like this. 'Cygnus X-1 Book II' was a dinosaur track. Well-played with virtuoso lyrics, but a Dinosaur nonetheless, and I think the band knew it: Never again would they create stuff like this. Just three years later they were doing new, fresh material like 'Signals' that showed big artistic growth, but still managed to sound like Rush. One of the few bands to truly evolve and yet still remain true to their musical ideals. Amazing. Best track: 'La Villa Strangiato'. My actual rating for this album is 3.5 stars."
5,Is The Remaster Worth Buying Again?,"This recording benefitted quite a bit from remastering. Assuming you enjoy this release, I would definitely recommend spending the money to buy it again.It is a very early and weak recording and whoever remastered it did a fine job. The bass drum/guitar presence is much ""meatier"" and still has great balance.Go ahead and buy again! You'll be delighted and it will sound new all over again!"
3,pet barrier,The barrier is the perfect size and just what I wanted but the joining bolts/screws do not stay tight so it slips of falls on occasion.
3,"Good idea, maybe not for big dogs","I had high hopes for this product, but was frustrated when it didn't hold tight and fell repeatedly against the strength of my danes."
3,Highland 20045 Universal Pet Barrier,"The Highland 20045 Universal Pet Barrier is not a bad product but not ideally suited for larger vehicles. Installed in a 2004 Honda Pilot, the twisting extension rods used to secure the main support rods between the SUV ceiling and the cargo tray are unfortunately at their limit and tend to slip when forced with ordinary pressure; not a desirable feature with pets. A solution is to place the bottom feet of the rods on small wood blocks that effectively shorten the legs. This feature may only be noticeable on vehicles with larger ceiling-to-cargo tray distances otherwise the product is satisfactory."
4,Pet Barrier,"This product satisfies about 95% of what I wanted it to. It accomplishes the purpose - keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat. However, the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don't secure them. I also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward. Overall, this product was worth the $26 or so dollars I paid for it!"
3,It does some damage,"This has damaged the roof of my NEW car. Only 3 months old and now a dented roof where this is located. The bars come loose and my foster dog has tried to crawl through and got stuck while I was driving. It just isn't a great fit for the Prius V and if you have a mat in the back, the challenge is greater. If you have a gentle dog that does not like to 'challenge' the fact that he needs to stay in his area, this might be perfect. I am tired of having to tighten the bars every week and I am bitter about the damage to my car."
5,Dog Barrier,We just bought a new Hylander and wanted to keep our two small dogs in the back of the vehicle for safety purposes and to keep them off the leather seats. This was easy to install and stays in place. The dogs are happy and we are happy.
2,Works but is very poorly designed,"I bought this having read the positive and negative reviews. After having used this for a month or so, I have to agree with the negative reviews. This gate is poorly designed. The pads that hold the gate in place do not pivot and my car's roof is not flat, so there is a gap between the gate's pad and the ceiling. This causes the gate to fall over, especially if the dog has been lying against the bottom of the gate. Also, installing the gate was a pain - not because it was difficult but because the screws holding the crossbars in place were difficult to access. Overall, I don't rate this very highly and I wish I'd paid more attention to my gut when it said not to go with this. Very disappointed."
3,Me,"Item came with missing pieces making it difficult to mount. As a result, my strong dog can knock it down. Too much trouble to try to return it, so I am gerry-rigging it to stay in place. Beware of this."
5,Fantastic solution for all pet lovers,"This pet barrier is seriously a life saver. I love my dog and love taking her on road trips with the family. The barrier fits perfectly and was installed in about 5 minutes. It looks great and doesn't look 'cagey' like other ones on the market. It keeps my 80lb. bloodhound in the back where she's supposed to be without any issues. The only problem I've come across is that when you mount it it may separate your roof lining around the edges, but only if you tighten it extremely and it also may have something to do with the shape of my car. I would recommend it for any pet lover on the go."
4,"Great Quality, Great Value","I purchased this a little while back (December 2007) from Amazon for the back of a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I am happy to say that it is still in service today. You can go to PETCO, Petsmart, or many other pet supply stores and purchase a similar item for much, much more... However, if you are looking for a well built, durable, and effective way to keep your animal in the back of your vehicle, Look no further!"
4,Works well,"This product definitely works and was the cheapest one I could find, I am a little worried it might leave some indentations on the ceiling of my car, but as long as the dogs stay in the back that would be ok. It fits well in my Ford Flex, leaves a nice big space for the dogs in back and plenty of room for passengers. Easy to install."
3,needs rigging to function,Great concept but needs rigging to function as it is meant to. If you don't mind tweaking the item to get it to work horizontal bars move when dog puts paw on them & creates a large enough space for dog to come through.
4,A Marvelous Juxtaposition of Mystery and Modernity,"A geopolitical saga that is a melange of magical realism, historical and contemporary commentary, and romance, Rushdie's newest novel delves into the root causes of terrorism, and explores colliding world views competing for the same space."
3,Tiny Tribute,"Mary Pickford was a major silent film star whose career came to an end in 1934.This book, published in 1935, is a small document of her religious beliefs, mostly concerning death and grieving. In it, Mary is very positive and states that one must be happy that loved ones are close to God and in a happy place, that by mourning them, one only makes them sad and guilty to be in a better place.The book reads as a sort of journal, probably of Mary's own hopes for her mother who died in 1927 and her brother who followed in 1933. It seems to serve as therapy to Mary; its size betrays the fact that the thought is a simple one. It in fact, although profound, is rambled about for pages and pages.This book is a great addition to curious Pickford fans, but serves no purpose to those outside of that circle."
5,A magical book,"Rachel Pollack ahs written a book about the Goddess and our earth. This book is not just for females alone. It can appeal to both genders, sexual orientations and races. My anthropology professor recommended this book to me. It is a pionerring book that all should read. If we value our earth and women we must change our thinking and actions."
3,Hated this movie,"This movie could have been better had all three shiloh films been done back to back. I enjoyed the first two movies thought what the hell I'll give this one a shot, and now i wish that i hadn't. My only consolation is the fact that i only purchased this item because i owned the first two movies."
5,One of Their Best,"I'm a long-time Rush fan. I own them all, and I keep coming back to this one. ""Marathon"" is arguably the best Rush song ever written, and is one of my favorite songs of all-time. If you're into Rush, I don't need to explain. If you're new to Rush, start with ""Power Windows,"" grab ""Hold Your Fire,"" then work backward in time."
5,"RUSH ""Power Windows""","This may be one their most epic albums.... As anyone who listens to them still will understand how contemporary and pertinent their themes are today! I listened to them all throughout my two year technical schooling, being much younger then gave me impetus and heightened my ambition. They are one of the Greatest bands to have ever existed in the 20th. & 21st. centuries.... Rock-on!-VWIII"
2,It's a Nice Bread Box But..,"The box is well made and nice looking, however, once there is a loaf of bread, the box is pretty full. It doesn't take much before it's getting stuffed and the contents are pressed up against the glass. This takes away from the otherwise nice upscale appearance of the box. I hoped it would have been bigger. If you start with a loaf of bread (any size) add some english muffins and maybe another type of bread you are well into the ""stuffed"" zone. A bigger box would have kept us more organized and kept the breads in better shape with a better external appearance."
2,"Made in China, no WMF logo as pictured",WMF is a well known German manufacturer of steel products. This bread box is not made by WMF Germany and does not carry the WMF logo as shown in the photo. The box is made in China and does not meet quality expectations for WMF. It's on its way back now.
5,I loved it,There are so many things that the author describes in this book that everyone can relate to at one time or another in their life. She expressed on paper what most of us are thinking when in a relationship but never say. I thought the book was thought provoking and empowering. A delightful read and highly recommended.
2,An Unfinished Woman,"This is a memoir about a woman so selfish, so castrating, that it is wonder that she has any marriage left to finish. I kept wondering why her husband, Robin puts up with her. She appears to have very little to offer. She shows him no love or understanding - it's all about her, her needs, her yearnings. She has no sympathy for his new premature retired state in an isolated beach community. She resents his furniture, his music, his golfing, his plans She gives him a hard time about a TV he wishes to install in the house and his plans for some home remodling. She announces to friends that she would like Robin to take a job in social services. She complains about the lack of money coming in since her husband retirement, yet balks at going to work. She left him the year before to ""find herself"" It appears as though she still hasn't."
4,Excellent Synth Use In This Album!,"This is a really cool Rush album, because the sythts sound awesome in 'Signals', especially song's like ""Subdivisions"", ""Chemistry"", ""Countdown"", and ""Losing It"". I would have to say that my favorite song's on this album are:""Subdivisions"",""Analog Kid"",""Chemistry"",""New World Man"",""DigitalMan"", and ""Countdown"". Geddy, Alex, and Neil took a some-what different approach while making this album prior to ""Moving Pictures""...and it was an awesome approach! This album is worth buying if it is not yet added in your Rush collection."
3,Has Some Gems On It,"I used to listen to Signals quite often and think that it has some good songs on it. ""Subdivisions"" is a classic in every way. The synth lines are magnetic and grab you. ""Chemistry"" is also a keeper and quite impressive in all aspects. I think of this album as an ending of a cycle album. Because the next album (Grace Under Pressure) was a completely different album. I'm sure other Rush fans can tell this also. ""Losing It,"" is another song that I really like; it contains a lot of touching and emotional music. I guess it's basically a ballad, and is on par with the song ""Tears"" off of 2112. Signals is a pretty good album, and bridged the way to their new direction on Grace Under Pressure."
3,"Overall, a Great Effort with Experimentation but--","First of all, let me say that I have warmed up to this one LOT over the years. The main problem I have with it though, is that it screams 80's all over it!! The synths just seem to overpower it at times....while I enjoy the harmonics of ""Chemistry"" and ""Analog Kid"" is a great rocking tune--a lot of it just didn't ""Speak To Me"" like a lot of Rush's stuff has done...I am still tired of ""Subdivisions"" but I have always liked it's theme of outcasts, isolations, and industrialized society....I really like ""Countdown"", so you might say, since over half this album is pretty good stuff, I give it 3.5 stars....it's still a mandatory addition to all Progressive Music Fans' CD collections, though!"
3,"Good, but not great album","Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Rush's ""keyboard era"" (""Signals"" through ""Hold Your Fire""). Signals certainly has its moments; ""Subdivisions"" is a good song, ""Losing It"" is very powerful emotionally, ""New World Man"" is a very radio friendly pop song, and ""The Analog Kid"" is more like the traditional Rush sound. The lyrics on this album are very good as well, except maybe ""Countdown"" (i.e. ""... excitement so thick, you could cut it with a knife!"").The main problem with this album is that Alex Lifeson's guitar really takes a back seat while Rush experiments with New Wave, and even in a few cases, Reggae music. I think they really got it right on the next three albums, starting with Grace Under Pressure, but this one is just too keyboard heavy for me. Overall, this is kind of a bland pop album and very much unlike the rest of Rush's catalog. I certainly appreciate what they were trying to do, but the next three, in my opinion, were a lot better."
1,Stones missing/poor quality,"I got this as a gift (along with the bad perfume, but that's another category) and there were stones missing! I feel so bad for my Aunt who bought this. I could hardly ask for the receipt to return it, so I threw it in the trash. You could make this yourself for under 1 dollar. A heart shaped pendant at the bead store, a few small plastic rhinestones, 12 inches of cord and some glue."
2,lackluster Zep clone,"Unless you're a Rush completist you can safely avoid this album. The songwriting is unremarkable and the lyrics are painfully bad (though the pseudointellectual nonsense of later albums is absent). ""In the Mood"" may be the most ridiculously goofy thing they ever recorded. The attempt to clone Zeppelin is pretty obvious and results in a bluesy sound on some tunes. Other than ""Finding My Way"" and ""Working Man"" (where they demonstrate their developing instrumental prowess), this one is mostly forgettable."
3,Not A Bad Beginning.,"For a first Rush album, this is some raw stuff. I believe I was quite surprised after initially hearing this album for the first time a few years ago. It's really not what you'd expect, but everybody has to start somewhere. Most of the songs on here are not memorable, but I like ""Finding My Way."" Rush when they were raw. Geddy really sang completely different on here compared to Roll the Bones for instance. Not a bad album. Pretty interesting."
4,What a....,"Okay this isn't THE Rush album by any means, but I still love it. Working Man is the best and most recognizable track and points to better things to come. Tight playing and solid song-writing as usual with Rush. More blues based than other albums. Worth the money in my book."
5,"The legacy of Rush begins here,this album rocks!!!","This is Rush's debut with the late John Rutsey on the skins not Peart but he's still a great steady drummmer(he plays complex stuff too just listen to Before and After Take a Friend!)Geddy and Alex are of course in great form as always!!! The sleeper classic on this album is Here Again (an awesome slow number that's a treat to listen too!!!) Also includes the classics Working Man,In The Mood,What You're Doing and Finding My Way!!! Rock on Rush!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+"
4,What can I say after all these years?,"Track number 4 has one of the best guitar solo's ever. Our moods were mostly altered years ago when listening to this music and I thought that is why I liked it. Here Again triggers something in me. It triggers a feeling that this is some damn good music that rivals, at times, even bands like Led Zepplin. This first effort by Rush also reminds me of a girl who was a huge fan that lived by Stillwater Serior High. I am 48 now and am trying to recapture my youth and at the same time find music that makes jogging Lake Phalen easier. Can't even listen to Passage to Bankok (2112 effort) for I am in fear of the memories that will deluge me.-Dantheman"
3,Alex had this guitar...,"This is my favorite Rush LP for pure guitar power. I don't think that Alex Lifeson has ever played as hard as he did on Rush's self-titled debut. Geddy Lee's bass lines are very prominent as well. This LP is far from perfect. No Neil Peart, thus no talented drumming and the lyrics are kind of corny. But man o' man THAT guitar of Big Al's! I'm listening to ""Rush"" as I write this review. It is true that Rush's music got more refined and sophisticated over the years, especially with the entrance of the professor, however, for a then 14 year old boy that heard this LP for the first time in 1978, this thing rocked! It has great sentimental appeal for me."
4,FINDING MY WAY,"The very begining of the Rush epic, but hey, there's no Neil Peart, just some guy named Rutsey. Undeniably this is a different sounding Rush, but this is the band in its prehistoric state. There are many unforgetable songs here that were showcased in many a live set. Geddy's original screeching vocals and Alex Lifeson's unmistakeable guitar work are still here, but the drummer, although good, is not Neal by a longshot.Some of the songs that we all know are ""Working Man', ""Finding My Way"", and ""In the Mood"". My favorite from the set, though, is ""Take A Friend"". Despite being a Rush many fans are unfamiliar with, the album still rocks and has many great moments before they would depart into the sci-fi realm most of us came to love and expect. This disc just doesn't quite stack up against 2112, CARESS OF STEEL, A FAREWELL TO KINGS, GRACE UNDER PRESSURE, and others, so, I have limited it to a strong 4, but it is still an important part of any Rush collection."
2,Ya Gotta Start Somewhere,"If Neil Peart hadn't come along we wouldn't be talking about Rush today. That's just how it is. This first album is fine if you think of it as an historical artifact. Here we see the raw talents of Lee and Lifeson first displayed. It's clear that Lee especially is a great talent on bass. However the lyrics are banal, when not silly, and Lee's voice just doesn't work with some of the macho swagger stuff like ""In the Mood."" Is it any wonder we never here most of this stuff live? Now, we can listen to the music and look at the pictures in this album and see young men who are so obviously dreaming of being rock and roll stars and compare them to the older, wiser, and more musically sophisticated men who, 33 years later (!) are 'making memories' for us under the moniker RUSH."
2,"Humble beginnings, eh?","I should begin this by saying that while I gave this album a 2 star rating, any Rush fan would be quick to say ""that's 2 stars compared to other Rush albums, but it'd be at least 3 stars compared to any other band's albums!"" If you want to get into Rush, don't begin chronologically, as this album doesn't even begin to show the greatness and talent that would be so characteristic of them only 3-4 years later. I can only stomach all the Led-Zepplin-esque guitar riffs and lyrics for so long before I have to hit FF on most of the tracks. Though John Rutsey's drumming is tight, (and a lot better than he gets credit for, I might add) he's no Neil Peart, for sure. If you want to hear the best this album has to offer, just buy Chronicles or Retrospective I, as truthfully, I only will listen to Working Man, Finding My Way, and maybe What You're Doing these days."
5,The Birth Of A ROCK N' ROLL Band!!!!,"Despite it's naysayers 'Rush',the bands self titled debut album ROCKS OUT!!!!!!!!!!!Great stuff to put on with some Rolling Stones,Zeppelin or the first Aerosmith album.First things first EVERY SINGLE TUNE on this album rocks-""Finding My Way"" gets the ball rolling.And like it or not John Rutsey cannot be said to be imitative of Neal Peart at all.His style is far more direct and simple.As on every Rush release the roaringly high screaming vocals of Geddy Lee and his drum like bass work bring the bottom to the front.While the long closer ""Working Man"" looks to a progressive rock future ""Take A Friend"",""Need Some Loving"" and ""Need Some Love"" are all straight ahead rock n' roll without bluster.Sure there were more then a few albums like this but what seperates the good from the bad and the okay is individual vision and superior,catchy tune smithing.In Rush's case on this debut they have both in gigantic numbers."
3,Neil Peart IS Rush,"This was the very last Rush album I bought, completing my collection of all of their amazing pieces of work. I didn't expect to be all that impressed, and it met my expectations. Without Peart's genius lyricism, the words on songs like ""Need Some Love"" and ""In the Mood"" make me nearly laugh. Musically they're basically a Zeppelin ripoff, but that is to be expected from a young band just finding their groove (heck, the Beatles started as a cover band). That said, all Rush fans should own this album for ""Working Man"" and ""What You're Doing,"" if not just to listen to how the greatest trio in the history of rock began."
2,NOT OFF TO A GOOD START,"Back in the beginning, before they were the rock idols that they are now known as, RUSH, wasnt' all that great, or good for that matter. Coming off as ZEPPLIN want to be's, this group was a long way from sounding the way they do now. Guitars screaming, Geddy screaming, and I'm screaming, to a hard rocking cd, with some good songs. But for the most part it comes up short. Finding My Way, is by far the best song on the cd."
5,Happy Brithday? Oh yeah.,"Birthday Girl was a great movie. I rented it after reading some reviews here and I expected it to be terrible. Though I am a huge Nicole Kidman fan so I HAD to watch it and see how it turned out. It was fantastic. There were two things I think would have been nice though. One is some extra feature or hidden bonus feature that unlocks the Russian scenes so you get subtitles and see all of what they are saying instead of just finding out what the say later in the movie. I would also like to know whether this was a dark comedy, romantic comedy, sex comedy or thriller. My opinion? Dark comedy/romantic comedy with a few hints of borderline thriller/crime movie. Totally awesome. See this movie.You'll be glad you did."
4,Interesting story,Still not finished with this story however it is amusing and intertaining to read how it was done in the past when households had servants to do most of the chores. The concepts of what causes illness was both amusing and sad at the same time. Will certainly continue reading the book as it is one you can pick up and put down as the mood strikes you.
5,Textbook,"Well, this is a requirement for class, so I can't complain too much. Still, it looks to be chock full of useful tidbits."
3,No honor among thieves.,"This extremely fast paced story traces the activity of Gerry Kells, gentleman gangster, as he plies his trade in and around Los Angeles. There are no heroes in this novel. Only thieves, gamblers, gunmen, blackmailers and corrupt political bosses.Kells is present in every scene. If he's not being beaten up, he's doing the beating. If he's not being framed for a crime, he's doing the framing. Fast One is pulp fiction in its toughest, most socially irredeemable form. An action packed, fun read. But one that doesn't quite live up to the hype. Unfortunately, the new Blackmask Online edition has an inordinate number of typographical errors that are irritatingly distracting."
2,Foldout - not a Book,Read the description carefully before you purchase. This is NOT a book or paperback. It is a 12 page foldout (including the front cover) .... not exactly what I expected.
4,Short & to the point,"This is a good purchase. Of course you can buy larger books on tracks but this is just as good, and convenient to carry. You will find it all, well almost. this fold-out will make you want to live outdoors and track things all day long! so quit your job now, and get started, Pepe'!"
5,Working it ole skool,This is a really good video. The background looks a little PBS-ish but the workout itself is rockin! It is a perfectly paced routine and allows room for building up to higher weights. I was looking for a workout that was just strickly working out with weights and wasn't compiled with a bunch of aerobic hopping and moving all over the place and this video was it! Straight forward weight training. GREAT WORKOUT!!!
1,"Warning, Dr. Smith -- this DVD is CENSORED","I was as happy as anyone to hear that Mari Iijima was doing her voice in the new Macross dub, and so I bought the disc. The dub is good -- they do a competent job, although you have to get used to new pronunciations of ""Macross"" and ""Fokker."" However, I will not be buying the rest of these, for the sole reason that they censored the DVD terribly by cutting out Minmei's famous shower scene from episode 4. That's right, one of the most famous scenes in 80s anime, which was left 80% intact by Carl Macek, yet they throw the whole scene out. This is perplexing, since they allow Misa to say ""Oh, S---!"" in a scene where she says nothing of the kind in Japanese. This, and their incessant translation of ""Unified Earth Military"" as ""UN Spacy"" (just to be cute) causeth me to rend my garment."
3,Desk pad,"The product was fine, however it came damaged. The pad was creased down the middle, which I believe was due to the flimsy packaging, plus UPS poor handling of the package."
2,Worst of both worlds.,"This book is unlike any other O/S book I've ever encountered; if I'm lucky I'll never meet another one like! Imagine an unholy blending of a typical O/S reference and ""Ghost in the Machine"" (the story of the development team for a Data General computer) and you'll have a feel for this book; it does justice to neither genre. Members of the design team describe various features of the O/S in their own words along with trivia about MS politics and lots of patting themselves on the back:""this is a cool thing we did"". This approach produces a cluttered and not entirely coherent book. If you're expecting something like ""Inside WindowsNT"" you'll be sorely disappointed."
1,More of a business history than a programming aid,"This book will teach you a lot about internal Microsoft business processes and how Microsoft makes business decisions, but it will teach you very little about programming Windows CE. There's no code and very little about the OS structure, it's mostly a series of interviews with program managers and developers reminiscing about the good old days."
2,Shamanism with an Indian flavor,"Although, I use this book in my Shamanistic practice, I do not regard it to be about Native American teachings. In fact, my Seneca and Abenaki friends tell me that the writings of Ms. Sams are more about a White person's version of Native beliefs. There is too much New Age in her writings to be followed by a serious student of Native American religions. However, as a tool for Shamans, the cards and book are effective. Ms. Sams' writings present a safe approach to traveling between worlds. She encourages people to see beyond themselves.One caveat: Seneca, Hopi, Lakota, and Yaqui teachings not interchangeable. Each group has a different perspective and belief system. People should understand that Native American beliefs are community and tribal based. To learn the ceremonies, they have to go to the tribe."
4,Remarkable,Knaus brings a dose of realpolitik and detailed history to the often romanticized subject of Tibet....This thorough diplomatic and political history is vital to an understanding of the tragedy of modern Tibet.
5,Great guide,"I used this book when travelling around Vermont last summer. Tons of information on sights to see, outdoor activities, lodging and restaurant. The maps were also very helpful in navigating through the state. I liked the fact that it broke the state up into six main areas so it was easy to find information when I needed it. My only complaint is that they didn't rate things on a star basis so I used this book in conjunction with the Frommer's guide. I recommend getting both because the Frommer's was a bit skimpy on information about things to do and see."
2,I loved this kettle until...,"...the inside rusted out - big, orange, ugly spots bursting through the interior coating. I've had it for about 2 years, and I've used it just about every day. I'm thinking of sending it back to Kitchenaid, but I don't know if they'll do anything about it. Hard to believe a kettle this expensive isn't more durable. It should be."
3,"pretty, but not same green apple as mixer","pros: Appears well made. I never actually used the kettle before returning, but the device to open the spout seems like it would keep you from burning yourself on steamCons: I bought this to match my green apple kitchen aid mixer. The green is not the same. And although it is still a very attractive tea kettle, the green shades don't even compliment each other. This kettle is more of a pastel shade, while the mixer is very bright green. I guess I'm confused why Kitchen Aid would use the same name for two very different colors. I'll just be keeping my le crueset kettle in blue."
5,Lisa Haley and the Zydekats - their CD's are great!,"Lisa Haley is an awesome, talented, energetic performer. Her music is unquestionably hot Cajun/Zydeco. She sings and plays her blue fiddle and dances about the stage with nonstop energy. It is impossible to sit or stand still while she's playing. Lisa and the Kats proudly promote Cajun/Zydeco music wherever they go.I first saw Lisa perform at the Del Mar Fair in San Diego County, California in 1994, when she was a member of the Zydeco Party Band. I was so impressed by her obvious love and enthusiasm for her music, and my toes wouldn't stop tapping.Then she formed a new band, Lisa Haley and the Zydekats. They have two CD's -- ""Lisa Haley and the Zydekats"" and ""Waiting for the Sky"". I have seen them perform several times in Southern California -- most recently at the Adams Avenue Street Fair in San Diego on September 27, 1998. I'm never disappointed hearing this band play and their CD's are great!"
1,My head hurts!!!,"This toy is cute and well priced...but it is not for children under 2!!! We purchased the slide today at toys-r-us. On the sticker is says 1 1/2 to 4 years old. My daughter is 18 months and within the first 10 mins she fell off the top of the slide! There is NO room for her to sit down. She has played on other small slides at friends homes with no problems, this slide is to steep and needs some major improvements!!"
4,She Loves It!,"I bought thiss for my granddaughter and she loves it. She puts on her Wonder Pets Cape I made for her,Then climbs to the top sings the WP Theme song and down she flys ending with Weeeee! That was fun! I think it was a great buy. The slide is sturdy and easy to set up and take down with a little (okay a lot of pressure) I would recomend buying this for a 2 to 3 year old."
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS SLIDE,WE ARE GRANDPARENTS AND PURCHASED THIS SLIDE FOR OUR GRANDSON. HE IS 28 MONTHS AND ONLY WENT ON ONCE AND TOPPLED HEAD FIRST ONTO THE GROUND GOING DOWN THE SLIDE. THE ANGLE IS TOO SHARP. NEEDLESS TO SAY TWO OTHER CHILDREN HAVE TRIED THIS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. THIS IS NOT THEIR FAVORITE TOY AND COLLECTS DUST. DON'T WASTE $50.00 ON THIS.
1,Returned After Two Days,"I was so excited about getting a slide for my twin girls. I knew it would mean constant guidance at 15 months, but figured I'd start with the smallest, simplest, and least dangerous. HA HA! Wrong! This is very small, but too small for even this age, since they sit and their feet are almost half way down it to start. There is no platform to sit on at the top, and there isn't a railing on the slide itself to hang onto. It is so short and steep it is like a freefall and slam straight into the ground. The steps are vertical and impossible for wee ones to climb. I'm a tomboy and don't mind some thrill, but this is just poorly designed I'm going to try the Hide and Slide instead. Looks a little more gradual, like there is a railing, and claims it is meant for little ones with the multiplatforms."
4,FUN,I just bought this for our 15 month old. And she loves it. It is still big for her and she is an average size child. She kept sliding down it over and over again. It is a huge success in our house.
4,Birthday Fun,"Bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she has enjoyed since day one. She is a very active child and loves to climb the stairs and slide down. The slide itself has a few marks on it, but I guess that is to be expected when you are dealing with shipping etc."
3,THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM,"It comes with everything it says, but lets just say that the cloth isn't good quality. It came apart the first use, and I could almost see through the cheap fabric. But it does come with an instruction on how to use the cleaning equipment and when to use it. I bought it for my flute, but because the cleaning cloth was pretty bad, only 3 stars."
5,Commom Sense for Self defense,"At this time of the year I found this video to be excellent. It gives me simple, quick and easy ways that I can protect myself self in what would otherwise be a very dangerous situation. I think every woman should own one and learn these simple techniques that could save her life."
1,Defective out of the box,"I purchased this for a long trip last summer, hoping to keep my kids entertained on the long plane ride and in the car. The unit worked fine in the car, but the charger wouldn't charge, so it was useless on the plane and in the hotel rooms. I returned it as soon as we got back from our trip, but would not recomment this product."
4,Great value,"We purchased this DVD player to help us though long car trips with our 1 year old. We've used it a hand full of times, but have been impressed with it so far. The picture is fine and it doesn't skip - even on very bumpy roads. Our only complaint is the remote control. Either it doesn't work well or its battery life is small. I did test it when the player first arrived and it worked fine."
2,It died a quick death,"Well, I bought this last year, used it quite alot but BAM, it just quit. It loads then says there is 'no disc'. Alot of clicking noises but nothing. I am keeping the acsessories, but the unit is kaput.I ordered another brand from Amazon yesterday[Axion-$93.00], hopefully it will last.A very interesting thing though. I went onto eBay, and there were SO many dvd players up for auction, but below the image, it said ""item broken"".Never saw that before with other electronics. Some were high end, others cheapos. So in a nutshell, it proves that none of these are very reliable. Go for the cheaper brand."
5,A Life-Saver,"I purchased this portable dvd player for a long road trip with my family. It made it possible for my two kids to enjoy such long hours in the car. The picture quality is great, we did not experience any skipping or screen disturbance while driving (and we were on some pretty bumpy roads). The headphones are actually nice quality and it is especially nice that it comes with two sets, so each one of my kids can listen. It is easy to use, and the remote control comes in handy. I would suggest buying a separate car case, the one it comes with is not very sturdy. I bought the ""case logic portable/in-car dvd player case"" and it worked wonderfully between the two seats. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable dvd player."
3,Good value for the price,"Player is definetly worth the low price, only issue I have experienced is when the battery runs out the player quits, there is no low battery warning, I have only found the battery to have a max of 2 1/2 hours."
4,Nearly Perfect Warhammer RTS,Warhammer 40k is a very good game! Im saying that because it wasnt horrible and it wasnt perfect. The reason im giving this game a 4 out of 5 is because the campaign is too short. Other than that this game is superb! There is A LOT OF DETAIL. The gameplay is extremely addictive! The voiceovers DONT SUCK(unlike the voiceovers in kohan).The campaign is probably short so you can play it again just to notice all the detail. This is overall an awesome game but not perfect. Pick it up And youll be a RTS fan if youve never played RTS games before.
3,"Engrossing, but short.","I bought this game for my husband for Christmas. While it kept him busy for a short while... he had finished the game in under a week. For the amount of money I spent on it, I expect more than a week's worth of play. I was disappointed in that area only. However, he quite enjoyed playing the game."
2,$50 for this?,"I borrowed this game from a friend that found out he didn't have enough RAM to run the game. I was going to buy this game because of all the hype I had heard about it... good thing I borrowed it.To start the game is too short to be worth my $50. And it's not challenging at all. The 12 missions that you get just don't justify the price tag. I can get WarCraft 3 (both RoC and FT) for about the same price and I have, roughly, 8 times the game as DoW. The only differences would be that WC3 would have a degree of challenge. But wait... WC3 doesn't have that nice camera that can go down to ground level so you can be in the midst of the action... and you can't forget the glitches and bugs that plague this game... isn't that worth the $50 right there? Nah.Bottom line. If you like RTS games, your money is better off somewhere else... actually, ANYWHERE else."
1,Driver did not install properly,"The driver disk included displayed an error while installing. I contacted the manufacturer who emailed another driver. That one had the same problem. The card never worked properly and caused the screen to go black for 1-3 seconds randomly.This card was sent back.Heat sinc shown in picture is not accurate, this card does not have a powered fan."
4,Classic Mickey Mouse,Who doesn't want a fun Mickey Mouse for their collection? It was shipped super fast and in brand new condition!!
1,Not Very Good,"I must say that I am a fan of gingersnap cookies, I love the combination of crunch and ginger. While these had a definite ginger flavor, they were very soft and that was a bit of a turnoff for me. I do like gingerbread cookies but these didn't seem sweet enough for my taste and the almonds seemed a bit out of place."
1,Table-Mate II Woodgrain Crap,"Amazon.....please don't embarrass yourself by selling this product. It is so poorly constucted that I would hesitate to place anything on it. It's flimsy, it collapses at the slightest movement, and it is smaller than the prevoius Table Mate products. In fact, I am using an older model for my laptop on which I am writing at the moment. There is NO ..... I say again....NO comparison. My very first major disappointment from Amazon. Drop it."
2,Not as durable as it looks,"Looks can be deceiving. I thought this table was sturdier and made of wood. When I received it, I did not care for it, but kept it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it."
1,Stay awayfrom this item,A nice looking and durable looking unit.It quit working on it's second useIt did however make an impressive crash when it landed in my garbage barrel
1,Not adequate for vacuum sealing mason jars.,"After reading some reviews I thought I might give this devise a try. I was uncertain of its potential effectiveness but thought it would be a good thing to have for general preparedness (power failure and such)I purchased the CP7830 to vacuum seal dehydrated foods in mason jars. The attachments provided did not seal well with my FoodSaver jar sealers. The pump handle spring return started out intermittent and stopped working all together after the 2nd jar. The pump cylinder is small and it took many many pumps to achieve an adequate vacuum, it was difficult for me to use and my wife was unable to use it at all.This was a poor choice on my part and the poor rating is not reflective of its inadequacy to vacuum seal jars but on the fact that it started to mechanically fail within minutes of its first use.amazons return proses was painless and although this purchase was a flop, my confidence in amazon remains strong..."
2,"Feels good, breaks easily",I bought this to replace my plastic mighty-vac vacuum pump that was probably two decades old which finally broke its handle. I figured the metal construction would make it a solid product.And it seems to be holding up just fine now... now that I've fixed it!At the top of the handle is a small clip that attaches the handle to the rod. This clip popped off the second time I used it! Luckily I found it on the floor about ten feet away and was able to reinstall it.I ended up putting a quick tack weld over the clip to prevent it from popping off again and now it works great. I suppose a heavier duty clip may also do the job but being I use this several times a day as a professional tech I don't want to have to keep fixing it!If it doesn't hold up I'll just pay the extra money for a new mighty vac but I was very disappointed to see it break so quickly!
5,A Talking Mule was Smarter Than the High Command,"Francis had an amazing knack for sounding like Chill Wills, and Donald O'Connor was the hapless victim of his attachment. As a mule, Francis was able to get information on Japanese forces, and he passed this along to Donald O'Connor. When O'Connor finally identified his source as the mule Francis, it had the repercussions one might expect, but O'Connor did learn a new trade of basket weaving in the process.Roy M. Raffield"
3,Should be obsolete,"I mistakenly bought an FC8T9 bulb from the local HD, only to find out I couldn't get it to fit, as it was just a bit too small. Searching other local hardware stores, it seemed that nobody carries a 9"" circline fluorescent bulb. So online I go! Thank you Amazon!Just got it in the mail yesterday. Sure enough, it fit perfectly. Unfortunately, mine wasn't quite the same as the dead one... the plug angle was just a little different and made for a tight squeeze for the plug, and the light color was more dim and yellowy compared to my mistake purchase (which was a smaller 22-watt 8"" circline). I guess that's the low 2850K temp for ya... most others are 3000-4000K.Rather than replacing the bulb next time, I will probably replace my fixture instead, with something more conventional and flexible. I don't really care to pay for shipping that costs as much as the bulb!! and this bulb is likely your only choice if you have a 9"" circline!!"
4,Wrong size,"Fast service, good price, item Was to large around. Did not fit my baffle. But made it work. Would order again, but would call to get correct bulb. ;)"
3,Assembly is a disaster,"We have twin girls. They watched and screamed in anticipation of my putting together their new slide. However, I had to give up. The plastic tube is just to flexible to hammer the end caps on. I tried sandpaper and wax. All to no avail. This is a classic bad assembly. The plastic tube lacks the appropriate rigidity to allow the endcaps to be hammered on. The second problem is customer support is not open on weekends!!! So my baby girls will have to wait. Parents of small children know how hard that is."
1,Disappointment,"Had to return this slide. When it was opened, parts were missing and the slide appeared to have been used. This was a Christmas gift for our 22 month old grandson."
3,Good toy but Scary,"I just bought this for my 2 years old girl, she loves it and all her friends too but it's too high she has fallen couple of times...but we have lots of pillows around this slide so she dose not get hurt but i suggest not to buy this product if the child is under 3...Thanks!"
5,Little Tykes Slide,"I got this slide for my granddaughter who just turned 2 years old. It is extrememly sturdy! I was very pleased with the quality of the slide. We have it indoors right now, but will be great outdoors this spring/summer."
5,Purchase for Grandson,"The product seems very durable, but it is too early to tell. Purchased for my Grandson and he really loves it, so we'll have to see how it holds up for him in the years to come."
2,"Sad, Buy the Step 2 slide","This slide was not at all up to Little Tikes standards...It was very difficult to assemble. The hollow tube used to keep the slide attached to the stand was the worst. The end caps were difficult to attach to the tube, the tube bent under the pressure of trying to attach the end caps and guiding the tube through the stand and the slide was extremely difficult because the tube was bent. In addition, the cross bar that holds the slide to the stand never stayed hooked. After several attempts, I got the slide together. Within minutes the end caps fell off of the tube and the crossbar unhooked. We repacked the side and returned it."
1,MISSING HALF THE SLIDE,I am not happy half the slide was missing!! now i have a big piece of crap sitting in my basement!! will never buy from these people again!!!! i am not happy with the way this was sent! box was totally sealed and missing every screw and the bar under the slide and stairs!!! I HATE THIS SELLER!!! this is crap!!!
5,Birthday Present,I bought this as a gift for my daughter's 2nd Birthday. She loves the slide. It is sturdy and is good outdoor entertainment for her.
4,REALLY GREAT BOOTS,"I THINK THESE BOOTS ARE REALLY NICE. THEY ARE A PERFECT HEELHEIGHT, COMFORTABLE, AND WITH GOOD QUALITY LEATHER. I BELIEVE,THOUGH, THEY THEY WOULD WORK BEST FOR THOSE WITH THE NARROWERFOOT. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE, SO I REALLY LUCKED OUT."
4,"Good, but to many B-sides.","This is a pretty good representation of their hits, but the last 4 songs of the album could have been replaces by more songs from the albums that this best of is supposed to represent."
5,A great collection of Sevendust songs,"One of the heaviest heavy metal albums in my collection, this hard-hitting album will take your anger and frustration and channel it out of your head and mouth... Use this album wisely or your excessive head-banging could lead to injury!"
3,"Sorry, John","The universe created by Old Man's War is by far one of my favorites, and I enjoyed revisiting it in The Ghost Brigades, but Diary (and it is actually a truncated BrainPal entry) doesn't measure up. Nor should it -- it was originally a short story written for a friend. A mere 100 pages -- with a goodly number taken up by a roster of soldiers, it reads like breezy poetry but added little to my understanding of the universe it inhabits."
2,Very Sketchy Story,The story is very sketchy and does not fit well in the scheme of things of the continuing saga. It looks like it was written more for the sake of writing instead of filling in a gap in the timeline.
1,Tepid,Compared to other books in the series this is a rather tepid read. A story of Sagans emotional journey wasn't what I hoped for. Isimply found it rather boring.
1,Yawn,What an utter waste of time this was. Mr Scalzi needs to move on and stop re-telling the same story from different points of view.
5,A really good read,"This is one of the better books that I have read for a long time. With beautiful imagery, well written characters, and captivating, powerful subject matter, I would recommend it to just about anyone. It will challenge you to think and the author has no qualms about addressing really profound issues or provoking intense emotions of joy and pain, often hand-in-hand. She sneaks in a warm and easy but veiled tour of Atlanta and brief southern history, alluding to many hidden easter eggs that beckon you to explore on your own. I had to pick up a dictionary several times, but I like to expand my vocabulary; I will never hear the word cacophony in ignorance again. :-) The people and moments in the story really stay with you and I'm reading it for a second time because I miss them. Caroline Ledlie has quickly taken her place among my favorite writers and I am eagerly awaiting her next work."
1,This book is useless,It is badly written and has no central theme.Plus at $14 for a little paper pamphlet that is 18 pages long?I sent mine back for a refund - How do they get away with this incompetent writting?
2,Disappointing,"After reading the first Lash Book about Eleanor & Franklin, I found The Years Alone to be a bit tedious with a lot of minutae about minor figures of the time. Most interesting parts were about her distrust of Kennedy because of his father & his Catholicism Although Eleanor was very liberal she had a distrust of the hidden designs of the Catholic Church based on life long encounters with it. Cardinal Spellman maintained a personal vendetta against her for being against giving public aid to Catholic schools & the long standing arch conservatism of the Catholic Church in civil rights & personal freedom. The Years Alone only touches on her achievements in welfare, refugee rights & disillusion with the Eisenhower administration & how her many talents were passed over by the Republicans."
3,KItchen accessories--toddler,"These utensils are sturdy and realistic, and I love having the wooden organizer to store them in. I had considered just using toddler spoons/forks in her kitchen, but having the mini organizer really makes the difference. When I first opened them there was something sticky on the utensils, but it washed off easily."
5,The Country I Wanted to know.,"Geraldine Brooks has written a book that I can empathise with. I think of how I might have had that life in Australia had my parents not returned to England in the 1930's. I wanted, and still do, very much to talk to the author and ask her questions as she is such a good writer with a warm personality."
5,Wonderful Read!,"This was a beautifully written, poignant story of childhood, family and friendship. The author really captured for me a sense of what it must have been like growing up in suburban Sydney on 'Bland Street' in the 60s and 70s.As a child growing up in Scotland in the 1970s I also had Pen Pals - a girl from (what was then) Yugoslavia and a Nigerian girl whose father was the Governor of Kano, NIgeria. She went to boarding school and had horses and a pet monkey. Reading Brooks' letters to and from her Pen Pals brought back childhood memories for me, I also remembered thinking these other girls lived in such exotic places and had much more exciting lives than I did. Of course, I lost touch with them but I may still have their letters at my parents' house. I wonder how many readers will be inspired to find their own long lost Pen Pals after reading this book?"
4,Prompt Delivery,"It was very good to deal with Amazon since i received my product, much before time, and in excellent condition.Would like to deal with Amazon.co again !"
3,Too short .. few really good songs,"I like the spirit, but this album is too short and the last songs are not good. But the first three are really cool!"
2,ActronCP7853 remote starter switch,the instructions on how to connect to an old (1970) v w beetle were not included. i would not recommend it.
3,Almost the Weakest Rush Album,"This is my 2nd least favorite Rush album. The worst one that they ever put out was the one following this one, Presto. These two albums were an attempt by Rush to become more mainstream. Although the musicianship is as always very competent and at times inspired, they lose most of their edge here. Hold your Fire is about feelings between people in general and how we inspire those feelings in ourselves and others. It is a worthy theme, but it comes off as treacly and lightweight. The music doesn't save the theme, and the prevalence of mid-tempo material undersells the album. A few more rockers and/or a slightly harder edge would have added life to the album. Rush is a rock band. This album is the Rolling Stone equivalent of covering Air Supply. Even so, there are some very good songs here if you listen with an open mind and you bury the lyrics in the background. Leave this one for last if you're collecting Rush albums and you're new to the band."
3,"I Hear The Passionate Music,Read The Words That Touch ......","Hold Your Fire was the best 80's Rush album. Despite the overabundance of synths,which make it sound very dated now (docked a star for that)their are some well crafted songs with great lyrics.I especially love Geddy Lee's bass playing on this one,especially on ""Prime Mover"".The complex middle instrumental break in ""Mission"" is one of the best moments of their career. This record was the culmination of the style that Power Windows only hinted at.Of course after this they made 2 terrible albums before recovering with Counterparts,another album that was definitive in a new style."
2,This album is very very RED,"Is it communist?I like FORCE TEN and OPEN SECRETS. The rest is either sort of okay (TURN THE PAGE) or, let's say, not at all okay (TAI SHAN).I love Prague rock *and* Canadian power trios, but even the mighty hosers in Rush can make a weak record. Look, I'm not happy about it either, okay?"
1,Dont bother buying this particular Rush album (cd),"This is the worst Rush album(cd)I've heard so far and I've heard most of them since I've been a fan of the band since 1977. what were these guys thinking when they put out this out ??? only the first two songs sound any good. I bought it cheap from here and after listening to it about six times I decided to trade it in. ""Live In Rio"" is also another Rush album(cd)that is not worth buying as you can hear the audience in every song. why they recorded it this way is beyond me but it was a dumb thing to do."
2,Hold My Fire!,Not the greatest of Rush albums however one for the digitally remastered archives and well worth the order fee. Great service from Amazon in speed and supply. However please stop using those sticky bar coded stickers along the edge of the cd box they wreck the presentation and also are a devil to remove. The box for the delivery was also way too big!! Talk about over packaging and the whole green thing!Many thanks though for great supply.Thanks
1,Worse than the sum of its parts,"People, people, this album blows. Force Ten is a fantastic song, of course (but then, most Rush album openers are great). But the rest is a different story.See, the other 9 songs might have actually been a reasonable diversion on their own if spread out on other albums. But lumped together, it is an absolutely nauseating effect. One generic adult-pop song after another. When the songs are slow, there are no good melodies - when they attempt to rock (which is rare), there are no good riffs.Now, the argument can be made that the lyrics and 'artsiness' of the album make up for it. From a certain perspective, this could work ... not for me, though. Don't get me wrong - I don't mind artsiness in and of itself. When artsiness and pretentiousness are combined with good or great music, the results can be stellar. BUT, when combined with mediocre or worse music, the final product becomes revolting to the core.And that is why HYF gets 1 star."
1,TOTALLY COLD< FORMULATIC< COMMERCIAL,"RUSH is not the best band in the world, like some reviewer below said. THis album proves that. Their songs were enver again played by the band after that tour."
5,Excellence all around,The CD arrived in immaculate condition. One of Rush's more ambitious albums but still good none the less.
4,A tribute from one of Barbie's most ardent admirers.,"Most fans know Billy Boy as one of the ""original"" fashion designers who lent their skills to Barbie couture. Billy Boy was perhaps the most ardent admirer of the 11-1/2"" fashion doll, and while his association with Mattel lasted for only two doll releases (1985's Le Nouveau Theatre de la Mode and her followup Feelin' Groovy), his tribute to the Fashion Queen Extraordinaire lives on in this book. If you are looking for a guide to identifying dolls or viewing a complete history of the most popular toy in the world, you'll be disappointed, but if you want a true tribute from one of her biggest fans loaded with pictures of one-of-a-kind dolls from the world's most well-known designers, then this is the book for you."
5,Best Drew Berrymoore Movie ever.,I really love the first movie with Drew in it but not so much th second movie it really doesn't follow the first one.
3,Not for professional mechanics,"After online shopping it seemed the best value with long line and several attachments. I tried it on my 2 Buicks, was very quick and easy, line was long enough to route thru hood onto windshield and read pressure while driving. My first Actron purchase. Seems good quality and is much less expensive than Snap-On.Update 11/30/2011: The pressure hose is dry-rotting with spider-web cracks all over the surface. I have Mac andSnap-On hoses much older without dry-rot, so this must be one way they got the price low. It's still working, butnow I wish I spent the extra on the Snap-On."
5,Great product,I haven't used it much yet but it seems to work well. I like the fact that it contains enough connections to check fuel pressure on most vehicles.
4,Superb Collection.,"Being an ardent admirer of Irish Dances, Michael Flatley Collection was a balm to my senses.The music, dances, choreography, etc., were excellent.The DVD was very clear with rich colours.I shall always welcome another collection like that."
2,Should've just bought the soundtrack,"Before you put down my review for giving such a good performance a bad rating please read the details:Very disappointing that the audio and video seem to be out of sync -- you see the feet hit the floor not when you hear them hit the floor but offbeat.The camera view also switched much too frequently for my taste.If you think that you are getting three videos in one be careful -- ""Lord of the Dance"" and ""Feet of Flames"" are pretty much the same performance just done at different times with maybe some different costumes.If I were to do it again I would just purchase the soundtrack."
5,Great Dancing,This was a very good DVD for the money. I loved Riverdance and I had a VHS copy of Lord Of The Dance. My nieces both dance and enjoyed watching this with me.
5,Little House books,I've been watching this price for months and finally got them. I can't wait to read them over and over.
2,not enough for the price,the paper dolls look generic. and for $10 the should have been better. they are not even punched out. I bought them for my mom though so she will not be really playing with them.
1,Ugh. Gag Me.,"All I will say is, STAY AWAY from this book. If you are a newbie, I recommend the Manga. If you are a purist, like me, I say it can't possibly get any worse. This is basically DiC + a lost episode. If you want the real story of Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon, go read the Manga...-_-;"
2,Incredibly DIC-ified,"Okay, if you are into the DIC version and don't really care that these characters have more depth to them, it's a good book. If you are a Japanese purist, this book should be burned. I'm kinda in the middle, and it's so rare to find Sialor Moon in my area that it's on my shelf. I didn't absolutely love it, but I didn't think it was THAT bad. I have respect for both DIC and Japanese, so this book wasn't absolutely horrible...it just wasn't that good."
3,"This book is good for new fans, but not experienced ones.","This book is pretty good for new sailormoon fans. It has colorful pictures and lots of information. But, if you are an experienced sailormoon fan, like me ^_^, who has seen the japanese version and can take the nudity and foul language, this is not for you. Compared to the original japanese this is not good at all. So, if you just started watching sailormoon, this is a good starter book. I think that girls who like sailormoon and have seen the original japanese, you should start working on the mangas!!"
5,A Different Persective,"I have a tremendous amount of respect for the purists where it comes to Sailor Moon, however they do not leave room for the average Sailor Moon viewer Who watches the show on TV. I read this book to my five year old and we loved it. It was a way for her to get a little bit more information on the characters she loves, and a different medium in which to enjoy the tales. I would highly recommend this book to any young fan, especially those early in their Sailor Moon quest. The book helps to blend the Dic version of Sailor Moon with the more pure version my daughter is just begining to learn about. GOOD READ!"
3,Sailor Moon,"My first question is, why didn't the cover artist show the full picture of Serena and Tuxedo Mask? Until I saw the full picture somwhere, I was very curious as to what the black and white hand-looking thing on the edge of the picture was. I think the cover could have been done better.Also, I have to say that in this series, Serena and everyone else practically moved to the U.S. How many Japanese girls listen to *NSYNC? I'm sure some do, but still.Serena occasionally saying ""Oh my God!"" got on my nerves, too. I personally don't care to say that myself, although some people may not agree.Instead of this book, I would've recommend the comic book series, which is more accurate and entertaining, but I found it to be disgustingly trashy. Parents of younger, or protected children will be sorry they ever let their kid read those books!(...)"
1,Blanket,"I also got a horrible looking blanket, I was so exited to see the package & when I opened it, the blanket looked like a tiger striped type with different shades. . Very disappointed, not what was seen on the picture. I was trying to post a picture of it but wont let me"
3,Communicate.....Please,"This is a nice blanket. I really liked the print. However, it is more of a full size than a queen size. I can't seem to get a reply from the distributor on the returns method or the price of the King size blanket so I can't return or purchase the larger size.I would appreciate hearing from someone regarding this matter......please!!!"
5,Masters of Live Music!!,"What an incredible display of musical wizardry that has made Rush the ""smart man's band"". You could listen to this album hundreds of times and hear a new lick, beat, etc. you didn't before. The best live Rush album available."
4,First gem from Steve's solo material.,"Great songs, this MFSL gold cd sounds good, hissy probably due to the fact that the whole recording was all played and done by Steve, so it's got a demo feel to it. It's still great though!"
3,Camera compatibility,"Notwithstanding the previous review I have to point out that the EM-140DG manual, page 18, (available for download from Sigma website) does not include the Nikon D50 in its compatibility list. I'm heartened to read that some have had luck, but as I have already returned another ring flash I would be careful about purchasing one where the manufacturer is not explicit. Places like 47th St Photo will claim everything works with everything to get you to just hand over the money.Or... you could rely on Amazon's return policy and deal with a little hassle. BTW, do NOT waste your time with the Bower or other <$100 units on ebaY if you have a D50. That's a REAL waste of time and the joy of dealing with less-than-stellar return policies.You got to hand it to Amazon, they rule in this respect!"
3,different from website descreption,"regarding the product features on the website the 55mm and 58mm adapters are included but what I received are 55mm and 62mm adapters and actually I need 58mm for my macro lens, now I have to pay extra money to purchase 58mm adapters and i think this is a deception and I am very upset about it."
4,no problems yet,I have some indoor painted wooden basement steps that get a little slippery when coming in after the snow we've had here in the Northeast. So i bought this to provide some grip. Installation was quick and painless... just clean the steps before you apply. I've had them installed for about 2 months now and have had no problem. They have stayed in place stuck to the steps and have not unstuck. Also the steps are not slippery anymore.. It provided the grip i was looking for. No real reason to not give a 5 star. I save that for things that surpass expectations. This product has met expectations.
2,No Story to Follow,"I am astonished at the superficiality of this book. I am a fan of Stewart's, yet he continually finds himself unable to say what he seems to be trying to say. Several ""as mentioned in the last chapter"" passages refer to items unmentioned. Still, he's a smooth writer. Maybe next time his agent and his publisher suggest a book (his own confession), he'll give it the same consideration he's given WSJ pieces brought to him as editor."
2,Expected better from Dremmel,"I was trying to upgrade from my 16"" Craftsman and I am afraid I made a big mistake. I could not control the vibration on this machine no matter how I bolted it down. I tried the suggested carpet pad but to no avail. I have sent this back for a refund, thank goodness that Amazon allows me to do this. I will try to save my pennies and go for the DeWalt or perhaps save even more for a HAWK. I am extremely happy with all other products I have from Dremmel but this was a disappointment. I also had problems with the light and the hold downs as was stated in another review. This is certainly not the scroll saw I was hoping for.D. Allen"
4,Great system for the price,"Package arrived in great shape, and setup was straightforward. This is my first scroll saw, so having some blades included was a big plus. It would have been better had the blades been labeled so I could choose the proper blade for the task I wanted to cut. The tension system is easy to use, but the lower blade clamp can be a bit tricky to figure out at first when using plain end blades. Since I'm just starting out, I keep the speed to 1/2 or less, but have turned it up to test vibration. It does tend to vibrate a bit at the faster speeds, but it could be my lack of mounting the saw. It is just sitting on an antifatigue mat over a concrete floor.The directions for mounting the sanding wheel were a bit vague and hard to follow, and the sanding disk inculded was quite agressive with stock removal. The addition of a couple different grits would have been nice.Overall, a great system and a good price, and worthy of a look if you are in the market for a starter scroll saw."
1,Arrived damaged,"I would tell you what I think of this product if I could use it!The saw arrived a few minutes ago and after I opened the top and started removing the parts , I realized that there was a broken part, so I pulled the saw out to find the part that broke off and realized that the bottom of the FedEx deliveredpackage was open ,so of coarse I can't honestly return it for a full refund. This was going to be a Xmas present and I can't figure out what to do with it now. In the old days you would simply call someone for assistance,not anymore."
4,stylish,"Being something of a sucker for anything the talented Clive Owen appears in, I looked forward to seeing this film. I had also heard excellent things about it-both stylistically and in terms of the plot/story. Owen plays a would-be writer who can't seem to write. His absent father calls out of nowhere to offer him a position as a croupier at a casino (a position he held in South Africa). As the intrigue of his position at the casino escalates, Jack (Owen's character) realizes he has great material for writing right in front of him. Croupier is a stylish film, and Owen carries it brilliantly."
2,A lot of hooh-hah about nothing,"Didn't get this at all. Must be a jazz thing, about the apotheosis of cool. Owen is not a hard man, he is your best friend's kid brother. He is milk and cookies.This film got a retrospective showing at a West End indy rep with director Hodges pencilled in to talk about the trials and tribulations of getting the film made and distributed. I didn't attend. That's the kind of existential guy I am."
5,Quintessential Guy's Movie.,"Well, of course their are no car chases (that's a joke) but this is a film most men will love. What there is in the film is an excellent plot that's so clever it ought to have a PhD from Harvard. I guarantee that the ending will surprise you. The lead character's travails are fascinating and will cause many a man to feel envy. I personally never thought much about what it would be like to be a dealer, or croupier, before I saw it but I gained an honest appreciation for what their jobs entail by watching it. Its also a film for writers."
4,"Great film, glad to see it on DVD","This was a film that I saw twice in the theaters and really enjoyed, and decided that was well worth paying for import DVD. While the film was as good as I remember, there are two things that I was disappointed with:First, it's full frame presentation with no option for widescreen (HELLO it's a DVD we want widescreen).The second disappointment was that the sound quality isn't perfect. There were more than a few spots in the movie where the volume levels were little off.All that said, I enjoyed the movie and still recommend it!"
5,Adorable and keeps you busy on rainy days,Its a fun project to do when you have free time on your hands and after you can turn it into a gift for someone else who may be a cat lover.
4,Great Guitar,"Heard the album at our favorite restaurant. The owner was familiar with the artist. We were only interested in one song, but the whole album is great, easy listening."
3,A publicity stunt,"meant to bring attention to the author, who previously had placed second in the Louisiana Oyster Eating Contest. (I'm not kidding. The author says so.) He realized he needed to come up with something better than that if he was to gain wide public recognition and managed to talk Land's End into putting up a million or so to back him. The account's not very well written, and the author admits he knows little about the sea or sailing or the Norse. Not surprisingly, many of his ""facts"" are wrong. It's not completely worthless, just not very good. Such a voyage should have made wonderful adventure reading."
2,"Too much sellin, not enough tellin","I enjoyed reading this thin slender book, although it was a bit thin on the ground as far as giving game, and then wham, ""THE END. Please go buy part 2, 3"" and so on.The writing aint that hot that i got my moneys worth in this first lick enough to spend again on more of the same.People curiosity got me, and i paid for it. No dispeect to Rosebudd because he's dman cool in American Pimp, he's the real deal and must have stories and knowledge to tell, but man you aint tellin it in this book but a bit, but if you want somthing worth your money watchAmerican Pimpread Iceberg'sPimp: The Story of My LifeandIceberg Slim: The Lost Interviews with the PimpandNaked Soul of Iceberg SlimorWhoreson"
3,Rosebudd The American Pimp,"Entertaining and definitely has insight on how a young player/hustler matures into becoming a pimp. What's messed up about the whole thing is that he retired pimping hoes, to legally attempting to pimp the customer/s who buy this book or pamphlet autobiography. To make things short, the story or tricks of the trade do not end in this book and his attempt is to keep you coming back as his smacks you in the face with volume 2,3,4,5. Good try."
1,Great Title. Lousy Book,"I had high hopes for this book, unfortunately its nothing more than a restatment of many other works. The book is full of sidebars and inserted comments that do nothing but distract the reader. More over theses inserts are nothing more than filler to boost the page count. Staci Kieth's ""Drive your Woman Wild in Bed"" A Lovers Guide to Sex and Romance, does a much better job of organizing and handling the subject."
2,A whole lot of talk and not much instruction,"I bought this for my husband, whose experience with the opposite sex was more limited than mine. I thought that if anyone knew how to teach about making love to a woman, well, this book would be it! Well, was I wrong. BORING!![.] It talks more about the spiritual side of love, the connections, etc., more than detailed instructions. There's a little of that, but not enough to justify buying this book. Don't waste your money."
3,Missing hardware,Looks to be what I expected will know after I go out and purchase the other half of the hardware needed to assemble
3,"Useful, similar items in local stores for slightly less","I ordered this one on amazon only to find a black version in a local store for a couple dollars less. I kept the Torin even though it came with a defective nut in the red cushion, allowing me to only bolt in 3 of the 4 bolts that hold the cushion to the raised U shaped frame pieces. It is still holding so whatever. The quality could be slightly higher, though I guess it would be fine if that 4th nut would not have been defective. It works so I'll use it. Using it to work on motorcycles."
5,Loved this survivalist African story!,"Hands down, this is one of my favorite stories ever. If you love survival and adventure stories, you'll love this movie!!!"
5,A Must See Film,This movie was really great. It shows how hard it is for teenagers to survive on there own. This movie was sad and adventurious. It also makes you think why someone did something as horrible as that to someoes family. I totally recomend it to someone who need a great family movie to watch.
3,LLM books are always a joy to read. This is no exception.,"I love when Ms. Miller writes a ""series"" book. Her ""Vampire"" and ""Corbin"" series were wonderful. I always waited for the next books. This ""Springwater"" series is in that same tradition. It has exceptional storytelling, excellent writing, and wonderful characters. The only fault I find with it is in presentation. Why couldn't this be one book instead of four? If she wants the series to continue indefinitly, she could have written it in the style of the popular ""Outlander"" series by Diana Gabaldon. This will not prevent me from getting hooked and reading all in the series. They are too good to miss!"
4,Better than I thought it would be,"After reading other reviews regarding the quality of this item, I was a little apprehensive to order it. But, it's dimensions and adjustable features were just what I was looking for so I jumped.I am happy that the one I received is made well even though the dividers are a little flimsy as noted in other reviews. The color however, is more red or cherry, than it appears in the images. It doesn't quite match the mahogany table I have paired it with, but it works so I will keep it."
5,Quick Delivery,"Fits properly. Quick Delivery. No issues with installation. Pricing was good compared to same product in Walmart, Pepboys, etc.YOU need this to install an after market radio, no exceptions. Additionally a WIRING HARNESS is also highly recommended as doing the crimping of the cables yourself, while possible, can be really troublesome if you don't have the relevant(and correct) wiring information."
5,altar boys- essential Xtian rock,"Altar Boys are the keystone of 80's christian rock, an essential to any collection; and frankly these are becoming collectors items. Moreso importantly, on a personal level, these songs/lyric/content have been integral through the last decade of my own christian experience. You'll love these guys."
4,This is a Documentary DVD,Here you will see the tests performed to unravel the mystery of the Crystal SkullsNational Geographic quality DVD a good synopsis.
5,Soft and comfy!,"My son bought me these. I love them, they are so soft. I wear them every night. I'am so glad my son bought me these!"
3,JASON BATEMAN SAVES THIS PREDICTABLE FILM!,"I enjoyed this film, but it just didn't make me laugh as much as I wanted it to. Jason Bateman is the saving grace in this film and he an under used and underrated actor. Gene Simmons has an amusing role as an ambulance chasing lawyer...yeah I know a real stretch for him!lol! This film has some funny moments, but never reaches past the obvious. It's certainly worth a look, but rent this before buying it."
5,Funny!!!,"This is one of the funniest, smartest comedies ever. It should have been marketed better so that more people saw it in the theaters. Deserves to be a cult hit."
5,Extract is amazing like air,"Mike Judge is the man behind Office Space, the greatest comedy that came out of the 1990's. Jason Bateman is one of many cool stars in Extract that prod the film along into new cult status. A comedy with dark aspects and hilarious situations. Did I mention Mila Kunis? Or Gene Simmons? J.K Simmons - no relation, also makes his presence known. A dvd worthy to keep."
2,Terrible For A Mike Judge Movie,"I am so disappointed with this movie. I am a big Mike Judge fan. I loved Beavis and Butthead (still do). I loved Office Space and Idiocracy. I own copies of all of these and will probably upgrade them to Blu Ray when they come out in that format. Those are some of the funnies movies I've ever seen.I'm NOT a King Of The Hill fan and this movie seems to be as laid back and boring as that show.There was one or two spots in the movie where me and my family laughed a little bit. Otherwise, it was a waste of money to me. I think I'll 'rent' his movies from now on before I buy them (especially on Blu Ray). I may actually sell this movie instead of keeping it in my collection."
5,12 Stones Huge Fan!!!,"This CD rocks! I wrote a review on the first one which is just as good but this 2nd one is great! Pauls voice is great and adds a great touch to all the songs. Greg and Eric play the guitar so good! I love all the solos they have in it. Aaron is incredible on the drums and adds so much to the songs. My favorites are all of them. I listen to cd all the time when I am driving and crank it up on ""Far Away"", the video for the song is awesome!! Check it out at 12stones.com and see their past videos on there. See 12 stones live, they have so much energy and i can't wait for them to come back here!! If you liked 12 Stones 1st cd you will enjoy this one, great songs, great lyrics and a good new touch added in. WOOO 12 STONES!!!! KEEP ON ROCKING!!! :D"
1,Same Crap Different Album,"this album is a waste of money, thank god i had my friend burn it for me before i went and bought it because its just that bad.in typical 12 stones fashion every song sounds the same and paul mcoy still can sing. do yourseves a favor and buy Alter Bridge's Debut Cd One Day Remains and listen to real musicians,it's one of the best cds ive ever heard if not the best."
4,Good follow-up,"If you liked the first CD then this will also appeal to you. This is a much deeper sound. I think vocally this CD raises the bar over their previous release. If you are new to 12 Stones this would also be a good starting CD to buy. I don't think you will be disappointed if you like bands like Creed and Nickelback. They are deeper than those bands musically, but similar in music structure."
3,Very unlike the first one,"My question is, what happened to the 12 Stones that I know? The sound on this CD is totally the opposite of the first CD. Sure, the guitars are heavier (which is a good thing), but most of the songs sound like most 3 chord rock songs on MTV. However, I do have to give my complements for ""Far Away"" and ""Photograph,"" which are the two that I consider the standout tracks. To me, those two songs sounded like their debut. In conclusion, the music is not bad, but not as original as their debut."
5,12 Stones does it again!,"This sophomore release by the 12 Stones is seamlessly produced, flawlessly played, and written perfectly! With the opening riffs of ""Shadows"" the listener knows full well they are in for a ride similar to the first self titled release by Paul and the boys. The progression doesn't just stop in the musical maturity from ""12 Stones"" to ""Potter's Field"", but within the album itself each song builds upon the previous; not only escalating the listener's interest in each lyric, but also their own emotional attachment to what is being said.""Potter's Field"" also deals with real issues, that real youth deal with on an everyday basis. And it does so in a way that gives teens a hope to look for. Rather than saying ""There's no way out,I'll just deal with it on my own,"" ""Potter's Field"" says ""I can't do it alone, help me.""Enjoy!"
5,"superb, European nu-jazz","Marc Moulin is a Belgian jazz musician who has been playing for many years. This record, Entertainment, takes some elements of jazz and combines them with warm sound textures and vocals. The result is hard to pigeonhole, which is good - it's creative and different. Warmer than acid jazz and house, without any harsh electronica, the music is very upbeat, encouraging, and infectious. It will get you out of a bad mood and stimulate you. Superb record, very creative, yet very familiar and warm."
5,Very Emotive,"The first time I saw this movie was on British Airways on my way from London to Houston, it was such a nice movie, I usually hate long flights but this movie made my flight an agreable one.It was really a very sad movie, very touching, I was very sad for Kate, character played by Andie MacDowell, it shows how friends when they try to over protect you, they ruin your life, the music is great and very emotive.When I came home, I bought it because I needed a copy of that great piece of art.The character is beautifully played by the inborn talented Andie MacDowell.I strongly recommend you to buy this movie, you'll surely enjoy everything, the moral of the story, the music and all the other characters. It's also in a nice setting in England, very beautiful landscape. And prepare your handkerchief because you won't be able to hold your tears. Even guys will cry."
3,Good plot but needed better acting and scenery!,I understand the plot from Plan 9 but I think Ed Wood could have done a better job with some of the actors and even scenery. It would not have cost too much more to shoot the graveyard scene in a real cemetery instead of a weed filled lot. Have to wonder about aliens as car hops. The preacher could have been reading or mouthing the words from the Bible rather than staring at it during the funeral. I guess I could go on and on about some of the very out-in-the-open errors. My cinematography teacher told me that you can use that movie to see how not-to-make-a-movie. See it when you have nothing better to do.
4,"The ""KING""of camp classics","This is my all time favorite ""camp classic"".Its great to watch over and over again to catch all of the ""flubs"".The flying saucers on strings,the shower curtain in the flying saucer.the cardboard tombstones and the hilarious dialogue.The list goes on and on.This is the best of the worst.I've watched it more than any movie in my collection."
4,A Bad Movie -Maybe- Worth Seeing...,"Plan 9 From Outer Space is definitely worthy of being considered one of the worst films of all time. In fact, it is so bad that it takes serious commitment to sit through the whole thing! I would say that it is excruciatingly painful (to the mind) to watch this movie. It is horrendous! But that's why we all watch it, isn't it?It is indeed terrible, full of blatantly incorrect ""scientific"" information. It is worth seeing just for the speeches towards the end - completely hysterical!However, I would like to point out that the *documentary* of Plan 9, which is included in this version, is at least as poorly made a film as Plan 9 itself. The documentary is a farce. I turned it off after about three minutes of fast-forwarding.So you've been warned about Plan 9 - see it if you dare!"
4,This movie is so bad that it is funny!,"This movie encapsulates the obscure art of being so bad that it is good with very funny acting, dialogue, and script! I especially like the ""aliens"" from outer space, in particular the leader who had on too much eyeliner. I did, however, feel sorry for Bela Lugosi who was such a star in ""Dracula"" but who fell from grace with Hollywood producers and ended up as a character who did not even have a name in this movie."
3,A mistake in most reviews,"Most reviews speak of Bela Lugosi's untimely death before or during productions. Fact of the matter is that Bela never was connected to this movie. Ed Wood just needed a star to attract the crowd and since he had some strange footage lying around, he created the beginning of this movie from this footage. That is why the beginning is so funny !! We see a picture of Bela Lugosi walking around in a black dracula-like cloak, picking a flower, walking out of the picture and then we here the sound of an accident. For the rest of this film his character is played by the producer's wife's chiropractor.This movie is great to watch with a bunch of friends."
3,"Deceptive Packaging! But, Great Movie","Beware, this version advertises ""The Ed Wood Story"" documentary. It isn't a documentary, but individual interviews. They are good invterviews, but it's not a documentary."
5,How can something this bad be this good?,"Plan 9 from outer space is one of the worst movies ever made. It is certainly the most famous bad movie ever made. This movie, is so incredibly badly written/acted/directed/produced that it is actually a very good film! It has a certain charm, something that grabs you the most when u know the background to the movie and its director. A truly well intentioned man, who happened to be very unskilled at what he was the most passioante about; making movies. This movie has so many classic mistakes and errors in it, they're not worth counting.Treat yourself to one of the treasures of filmamking history. This movie oozes charm from beginning to end, and has great entertainment value. However you take this film, one thing is for sure; you'll be entertained! - and isn't that the point of watching movies? Five stars."
1,Passport Video,"Please Do NOT Buy the Passport Edition for the following reasons:I received the item and I could already hear the item shaking around in the case unopened. The Case looks like a normal high quality but as soon as you open it you will discover it is not. Packaging is everything. The DVD comes pre-scratched in a condition that I have to beg my player to accept it. Maybe these scratches account for the low quality of the transfer, But I do not believe they do. Also, passport gives you a fine view of their logo for the entire duration of the film. I've had DVDs for close to ten years and my oldest ones aren't scratched as bad as this one. By the way, it smells horrible. Yes, this dvd literally stinks. I don't even have to review the movie because if you order this DVD, you'll never watch the movie as it stands."
5,See This Film!,"Plan 9 is certainly not the worst film of all time. Most of the films out there are far worse - gory, stupid, insipid, pointless and soul-less, and, incidentally, have far more money behind them.Plan 9 does have a sloppily written script, to put it mildly- although there are parts that truly shine, such as the inspiring words spoken by the aliens, that are evidently Director-Writer Wood's own thoughts- but that is part of Plan 9's unique charm.Most importantly, director Wood did have a distinct film style: Don't worry about all the necessary details; Just get the darn thing finished as fast as possible, and have fun doing it.Share a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy this movie asap."
3,"uh............okay,","I saw this the other day and it was, different. Its so bad its funny. I don't think its the worst film ever maid(ever watch ""the postman""?) Its different."
1,1 Star is a compliment,This film is rated the worst movie ever produced. And rightfully so. Mystery Science 3000 could have a blast with this.
4,Fascinating brief introduction to an important thinker,"Nuland has accomplished the difficult task of summarizing Maimonides' complex writings in a way that is accessible to the common reader. Nuland's style is clear and concise, and he obviously admires Maimonides as a sort of Renaissance man before the Renaissance. It is true that the book gives considerable attention to Maimonides' life as a physician, but as someone who has dipped a bit into Maimonides' writings on Jewish law and thought but knew little of his place in medical history, I didn't see that as a problem. In fact, I found that that made this book even more enlightening.I could have used more discussion of the Guide to the Perplexed, however, beyond the notions that the book is difficult and that some see it as a hidden confession by Maimonides of his lack of belief (an unlikely hypothesis). The Guide is an extraordinarily fascinating book, from all I understand, and Nuland does not do it justice."
4,Continuing A Life of Crime While Doing TIme,"I read this book as I started corresponding with a prisoner (a former classmate of mine from public school) and became very curious as to prison life. I always assumed everyone in prison is remorseful, regrets their crime, and trying desperately to ""correct"" their ways thru vocational and education programs. ...Ha ! What I liked about this book, is that is seems very real. Compared to others prison reads written by academics, is that it's a story of gritty prison life told thru various actual prisoners. Prisoners who have no interest to reform, prisoners who are violent, prisoners who have been victims of prison crime, prisoners who collaborate with guards on schemes from drug smuggling to prostitution. So basically how prisoners adapt their criminal behavior to get them ahead in prison political circles during their prison time. The book is gritty but fascinating. Make that scary but fascinating."
4,Parent of a son in fbop,"My son is a repeat affender, I would probably say he has become institutionalized. So I guess the reason for me reading this book is that I'm just trying to find some understanding as to why. I read this for the most part because this was by a person in the system."
2,his worst discworld novel,"All of my favorite discworld characters were missing from this novel and I found the plot, at times, confusing and uninteresting."
3,So-so humor,"When Pratchett is on, he's hilarious. Often though he goes pages without forcing as much as a chuckle, and this book is no exception. While I've heard him compared to Douglas Adams, I don't find him to measure up - still, I have yet to see anyone mix fantasy and humor as well (plus some mystery thrown in in this story). His understanding of theology seems limited, but his writing is funny enough that I thought the book worth its cost."
5,"You missed the old Pratchett? Buy this, feel home again!","If you discovered the Discworld like I did (reading <Guards, Guards>) you will have this stuff as you read this, anyway.If you are torn between Pratchett, Douglas Adams, Robert Sheckley, J. R. R. Tolkien and Robert Asprin, WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG. This is definitely a MUST HAVE. What are you waiting for?If you have been reading Discworlds novels before, don't waste your time with my opinion, just go get it!This is definitely one of the best books P. ever did. It's shrewed, witty, ranges from slapstick to drama and back (often through misterious ways), in a nutshell, it's a Pratchett. I can't wait to see the movie (just kiddin', Terry;-))"
3,Abridged edition,"All Corgi Audio books are abridged editions, with Terry Pratchett being by Tony Robinson."
5,Penn State Scrub Top,Very nice fabric. Heavier weight than many scrubs and has a very soft feel to it.
2,too commercial and lacking power,"The album is just alright and a disapointment when compared with Blackout, Lovedrive, or Animal Magnetism. Virgin killer and In Trance are also better. ""I'm leaving you"" is awful just a backwards copy of ""Beat it"" no less. If you want to listen to a band that copies Michael Jackson, This is for you. If you want some really great rock, listen to anything else by the Scorpions. It really is crap compared to everything they did before. I bought this the day it came out in '84, because of what a big fan I was. What a let down."
2,How did this get past Quality Control?,"This is a good DVD for a beginner or those days when you just want to coast. BUT I had no idea the errors in the sequences could get so annoying. The price is right but it doesn't justify their carlessness in editing. There has got to be a better quality beginner DVD out there, spend a few extra bucks and get it. This may be a one-off for Yoga Zone, but just in case, I won't be buying anything else from their line."
1,What is that???,"I bought this expecting to actually DO something. It might be two workouts but I had to do both in one session to feel like I got something out of it, and I had never done yoga before, so rather than beginner's I do not know what it is. I can't believe it is considered a fitness workout."
3,Helpful,There was a problem with my order and they fixed it promptly. Very easy to work with and willing to help you out.Thanks!
4,Nice laminated quick guide to common animals/birds,"These are great for families, casual wildlife fans. For die-hard bird fans, you'll need the BIG Birds of Costa Rica book."
2,"mostly unhelpful, full of contradictions","This books gets 2 stars rather than 1 since it does provide some summarization of the various eastern and western views regarding death and eternal life.The author's own viewpoint is poorly argued. For example, Hick suggests that the traditional Christian doctrine of the immortality of the soul is untenable due to the emergence of the scientific mind. Hick suggests that anything which cannot be demonstrated as being in accordance with empirical science should be discarded. However, Hick then goes on to say that ESP, clairavoyance (sp?), and other psychic nad paranormal phenomena should be counted as reliable evidence for the existence of life after death (I wonder what empirical scientists would say about this). The author then turns to the eastern religions and panentheism to provide a picture of what eternal life may be like (but without any convincing arguments). On the whole, I think that this book is a waste of time."
5,Great book!,A book like this comes along only once and a while !You will enjoy it from beginning to end ! Highly recommend this great edition!
1,Not a workout,"If you are interested in this DVD you should check it out at the library, rent it or borrow a copy. It's not much of a workout or even a good yoga session. It's 2-20 minute sections, but there is no challenge and it's rushed. I would recommend Rodney Yee - Abs for Beginners instead of this one. I have a decent library of yoga/pilates DVDs/VHS and this one ranks lowest."
4,Tough but effective,There are two workouts on this video and I find the one lead by Al Bingham very difficult requiring a lot of arm strength. The other led by Jennifer is still very challenging but uses more variety. I like to use this DVD at least once a week and it feels great!
4,Yoga for Abs DVD,"I have never ever done yoga before so I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try.I was amazed at how differently I felt after just doing it for a few days. I walk with my shoulders straight and am more concious of my breathing already. It felt really good.As for abs, it too early to tell if it will indeed tone up the muscles, but I am enjoying the relaxing pace of this with the added bonus of feeling like I did indeed workout without all those crunches!"
3,disappointing,"i love yoga zone's studios and most of their videos. unfortunately, this one is below their high standards. it's very short and provides little workout -- even your abs wont feel much. there are 2 workouts and the 1st one is virtually useless whereas the second one does have some effect on the abs. in general, howeverm, the whole concept of this video is flawed and yoga zone should have known better. ""yoga"" means ""union"" which is inconsistent with the notion of targeted training. every yoga practise - even one targeted for the abs -- should have elements for your entire body, especially your spine. it should also have meditation. this tape has neither."
4,Very good Beginner Yoga Video,"After much thought and research I purchase this video along with another Yoga Zone beginner video and am happy to say that I am very happy with these choices. The settings are very calming, the pace is good for beginner level some of the positions are a little complicated for the beginner level. He goes over some of the breathing techniques and helps you understand what you should feel if you are doing the poses correctly, which is very helpful. The only reason I could rate this a 4 star is because the some of the poses are hurried along and the pace sometimes gets choppy and hard to follow. Overall though I feel its a good buy to get exposed to yoga basics."
3,Videos from my college years,"A collection of videos from Club MTV days. Turn This Muther Out, Poison, Feels Good, Knocked Out, Think, Play That Funky Music, Tom's Diner, Knockin Boots, The Humpty Dance, Don't Wanna Fall in Love, and Personal Jesus. Fair quality video but the ends of the videos run into each other. It has a nice menu system that lets you jump to any video and it plays the Club MTV theme (Downtown Julie Brown days!). I am satisfied but don't expect a ""Criterion"" level of DVD."
3,Bruce still trying to find his voice,"The Head on Album was written in short period and it shows. The band didn't have a proper producer so the sound suffers from it. There are some great tracks as ""Take me to your leader"" and ""Walking out on you"". But Paul Samson didn't deliver much memorable riffs on this one. He didn't innovate the guitar sound like BNWOHM bands like Maiden, Angel Witch, and Diamond Head. In addition, Bruce is still trying to sound alot like Ian Gillan and Arthur Brown on this. He tries to scream at times but the music is too weak to use those Banshee wails. The bonus track Angel with a Machine gun is good and the Kingsway Jam session is too overindulgent. If you are a Dickinson completist like me get it. If you want a sample of Dickinson's Samson stuff then get SHock Tactics and Live at Reading 81 those are better produced and written."
2,Like the album. Don't like the price.,For those of you Samson fans who want a remastered album take into consideration that this costs over 50$ with less than 5 previously unheard of songs. If you already have the version of Head On that features a Bruce Dickinson interview you don't really need to own the new version because the older compact disc sounds pretty much the same. You may as well hunt down the vinyl albums Before The Storm and Don't Get Mad Get Even by Samson without Bruce Dickinson if you want to own more Samson albums.This version of Head On isn't anything special and not worth the high price.
2,Not so great,"The book is ok. If you are looking for a summary or just straight grammar, then this is the book for you. It does have some exercises; however, it is too short and does not give the reader enough practice or ability to play around with the language. Something that I feel, as a classical studies student, is a must to master the early stages of the language. I am most disapointed with the summary in the back of the book, because it is not organized well enough for the reader to use until they start to reach the end of the book.In conclusion, this is a good book only when combined with others."
3,Cinderella - 'Once Upon A...' (Mercury),"A so-so fifteen track compilation that's aimed toward the completists. Here you get tunes from their first four(4) CD's, 'Night Songs'('86), 'Long Cold Winter'('88), 'Heartbreak Station'('90)- the band's first sign of their downfall and the tolerable 'Still Climbing' ('94). To cap it all off, there's a decent Janis Joplin cover of ""Move Over"". A super-low priced CD, that would be good to get at the used price."
4,hey,i like it because im such a collector of wwe dvds. especially the undertaker which is on the cover of the ppv.
3,Some great songs - but many better songs excluded...,"Overall it is a good collection, but I was surprised by some of the songs chosen. If the price is under $10 it is a good value..."
5,Sailor Moon Super S vol. 1,"Four words, this book is great. It's the start of an exciting new series in the Sailor Moon saga! New characters, new villians, and new transformations for the scouts! The drawings by Naoko are wonderful in this book. They look so beautiful and the story, I think, is the best one I have read so far. There is also plenty of mystery which will keep you wanting to read more. Who exactly is the Dead Moon Circus, what do they really want, and who is that mysterious young boy Helios? All this and more in the first volume of the Sailor Moon Super S series!"
5,Sailor Moon Super S: Super!,"When I both this book, my mind was still on the horrible Dic dub, and I though that this would be the same. Boy, was I wrong! The illustrations, simply put, are wounderful, the storyline is very good, and, needless to say, everything about it is great. It's split into three ""acts""- Eclips Dream, Mercury Dream, and Mars Dream. In Eclipse Dream, we learn about the Black Moon Circus, and Rini and Bunny have their ages swiched. In Mercury Dream, Darien goes to the hospital, Fish-eye takes over Amy's Apartment, and Rini and Bunny return to normal. In Mars Dream (My Favorite...) Helios kisses Rini, we learn a little about Raye's Past, and Phobos and Deimos transform into their human forms. Overall, really good."
5,Super also describes the book!,If you love Sailor Moon as much as I do you will love this book. It takes you to the extreme knowledge of these girls and it is hard to put down.
5,STELLAR!!!!,"i totally loved this book! I would have expected it to be a little bigger(like the original japanese comics), but the pictures were sooooo beautiful, and you really got a feel for the characters! i'd give this book a huge thumbs up! and keep up the good work S.O.S(Save our Sailors)!!!!!"
3,Good Resource BUT NOT THE BEST,"This magazine is great in the fact it has free patterns, if you want to stay out of date. I was a subscriber for 2 years, wanting heirloom tips, patterns, etc. Most of the free patterns are out of style, puffed sleeves, odd waistlines. If you wait 15 or so years they will be back in style. Some of the tips are good, great color pictures, many of Martha Pullen's extended family, but out of date and out of touch with current styling trends. Not many people wear leg-of-mutton puff sleeves in today's society."
1,"Outdated, incorrect information. Stay away!","This book was written before the version 1.0 release of the JAXB data binding API's. As a result much of the information in this book is incorrect and not current. If you follow the instruction in this book you will NOT sucessfully perform XML binding to java objects. For example, the book uses DTD's as the XML description model used by JAXB. This is wrong DTD's were dropped in favor of XML schemas. The instructions for using the JAXB jar files are wrong. The required jars have changed since this book was printed. The instructions for using the generated java data binding classes is wrong, the usage has changed since this book was written. The author tried to get to far ahead of the technology curve on JAXB and as a result authored this book too early in the JAXB life cycle. The book is of minimal value."
2,JAXB section is out of date,"The book describes the JAXB api based on an early access version. The definitive version is completely different form the early access version, making this book almost useless."
3,Useful but only so much.,As Be has decided to drop the PPC support in favor of the Intel development the sheer fact that the CD won't run on intel machines points directly to the limited help of this book...useful but only so far
5,Satisfying Resolution to the Series,"This is a very good movie. You get to revisit all your favorite characters from the anime. It puts a very well-done conclusion on the series. From an objective perspective, it is also very good. The ending makes you want to cry whether you know the whole story or not. It is a beautiful work of art with captivating music, meaningful characters, and an amazing story. It is a must buy for any fan of FMA or anime period."
5,Beautiful!,"This is a fantastic end to the great anime series. Don't watch this before the series if you want the real effect and understanding of what these brothers mean to each other. This series is easily on my top 3 best anime of all time list. But WATCH it in JAPANESE. Ed's English voice is atrocious. Anyways, a worthwhile buy and one of those movies you're still thinking about a couple days later."
4,Fullmetal Alchemist... with Nazis!,"As you may know, Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conquerer of Shamballa exists to give the first anime adaptation of Hiromu arakawa's acclaimed manga series a proper ending. Try saying that five times fast! Anyway, it's a good movie and to me it was mostly satisfying. And yes, Hitler's in the movie. But the Nazis are not portrayed in a positive light, so it's all good."
1,AWFUL end to a great series,"After such a great series, I had high expectations for this movie, and it failed them all. All of the build up of the series came to naught, and all of the groundwork laid for the science of alchemy was ignored. Plus, the villian was just about the most flat, underdeveloped, ridiculous thing ever.When a movie has to come with a fat guidebook to explain why they made the stupid choices they did, you know something is definitely wrong."
5,An Actual Review - Not just an opinion,"First of all, it's disappointing to see that the only language to be listened to is Japanese, but things change and I know it will be an upgrade. Secondly, the animation in this movie is so much better than the series that it almost puts the series' animation to shame. Now then, to the rest. The story is excellent: funny, sad, beautiful. You feel for your favorite characters when they're in pain, and laugh when they get a crack in at a long running joke. Yes, it doesn't finish everyone's life stories, but that's why there are sequels. The ""cameos"" on the other side of the gate, our world, make you crack up when you first see them, and glad to know those people still exist somewhere. If you are a fan, even just a little, or if you even hate the series, this movie is worth a watch and purposely not seeing it is depriving yourself of entertainment."
4,Clear well written overview on busing in Boston,"Lupo, a seasoned reporter for the Boston Globe, delivers us a bookbook on busing with a forthright no nonsence appeal. WhileLupo does have a slant towards the left, he offers an excellent historical, social and economic discussion of what actually took place in Boston during the seventies a must for academics concerned with desegragation and readers looking for fresh insight on an ever present issue"
1,totally awful,"this book is awful!! most of the code from the book will not compile directly, especially in later chapters. a lot of the code is not even finished (like the section on AVL and Binary Search trees). way too much energy is spent on creating structures and classes that already exist within java, and the math used to gauge algorithm complexity is unnecessarily complex. not worth even $20..."
2,Confusing for Students,I found this book confusing while using it in a Data Structures class. It seems to focus too much on the math behind the algorithms and not enough on the structures. It doesn't help that the author uses his own implementations as examples instead of using the actual Java implementation. I think this book is more appropriate for people looking for an in-depth explaination of algorithms and their use in certain patterns. For the learning of Data Structures this book makes it too complicated.
2,Misleading Title,"When I read the title ""Power Yoga"" I assumed that I'd be getting an intense workout. I was wrong, I didn't even break a sweat. Power Yoga, is about connecting the body with the breath. The poses are very, very easy and very slow. The first instructor is really annoying and the dubbing for the second half is poorly done. Yoga Zone has a few good DVD's but this isn't one of them."
2,Half Disappointment,"If you are looking for a gay sex DVD that shows it ALL, then do not buy this one. If you are just looking for some gorgeous (but non aroused) guys pretending to have sex then I would DEFINITELY suggest this DVD (the photography is excellent)."
4,a must cd for true rockers,This is a great cd that is a rocker right off the bat. No cheasy singles or ballads to taint this rockin cd.
5,Great Binoculars for a Great Price,"Very cool product ,not so heavy as I expected with a fine neck strap that doesn't irritate the skin .This is the best Binoculars at this price"
2,Leading with Soul - where does it lead us?,"The book does not tell how one can be a spirtual leader, at least this is my opinion. Instead, you have to draw your own conclusions. If you are looking for a book that tells you how to be a spirtual leader - this isn't it, but if you are willing to delve deeper read the postlude - soul at work."
4,"I bought this book by mistake, but...",Some times during life you make mistakes. I thought I bought a book about the Qur'an. But after having browsed the book I find it very usefull as a guide to the Islamic way of thinking. The detailed subject index in the back of the book is a perfect guide to information when you need it.
1,Hatred is Codified,"Reliance of the Traveller is a codification of bigoted and biased Islamic rules and laws governing more than just how to Moslems are required to live, but how to mistreat, abuse, cheat, and denigrate hated people who are not Moslem."
4,a good movie,I just discovered prime movies and this was a very enjoyable movie especiall if you like chick flicks. Helen Hunt was very good.
3,A little disappointing,"I was lured into this movie by cast names of Hunt, Johannson and Wilkinson. Of the 3 only Wilkinson belonged in this film. Since the film is based on an Oscar Wilde play it should probably have stayed on the stage. It is very talky and slow. Poor Helen Hunt seemed lost and out of place. Scarlett pouted well but not much more. Recently saw Helen Hunt in Sessions where she looked a lot more comfortable (and extremely fit) and gave a good performance. Scarlett has also done very well elsewhere. I won't hold this bomb against them."
3,Different,This is a good movie but not spectacular. It does draw you in but is some what long and the acting is good. Has a moral to the story too and an unexpected twist at the end. All in all not a waste of time.
4,You say you want a revolution...,"Regardless of technological denouement, and whatever your position may be on the influence of technology in modern life; whether you are a web-head or deadhead, couch potato or mouse potato, Luddite or acolyte; Andrew Shapiro has framed the crucial questions for the Information Age -- and nailed them to the wall.He has crystallized what it is we must ask as we inch closer to the precipice of a new era, where the pervasiveness of technology encroaches more and more on our daily lives. Most impressively, though, he has done so in a clear and lucid manner, without sacrificing insight or depth. ""The Control Revolution"" is your Rand McNally Atlas for The (digital) Road Ahead.This book is a must read for the digerati, literati, and TomDick'nHarri(s) of the world.Michael Mehler (The Brennan Center for Justice, 6/18/99)"
5,excellent book,"This book should not be out of print. Besides his more recent translations (interpretations) of greek and latin texts and the recent collection ""Birthday Letters,"" this may be Hughes' best work. It was his first volume published, and while volumes to follow, such as ""Crow"" and ""Gaudette,"" descended into a fabricated landscape, this volume derives it's subject matter powerfully and beautifully from, primarily, the natural world. Hughes' renown as a depictor of the natural world is made evident as deserved here more than any other volume he produced. As the first publised work of a masterful and recently deceased poet, this work should still be in print. Find it if you can."
1,Not the BDC reticle,"I was excited to try out Nikon's bullet drop reticle (the reason I bought this scope) when I received the scope I was disappointed to find out it was just the plain Nikoplex. The description specifically says it has the BDC reticle. This is not the case. Amazon could not exchange the wrong scope, so I was stuck with just a refund. Ordering straight from Nikon now."
3,A good icon,"Being a Hellenophile, I wanted a stutue of Athena as she was in the Parthenon, for my garden for a while. This one is a good copy,my only complaint is the face is too moden ""cutesy"" instead of having a classic Greek look and I would have liked one a little larger,but as it is the only oneI could find that is modeled on the one in the Parthenon ( or at least on the 4th century Roman copy of it-the closest we have)it will be the perfect crown for my garden fountain"
2,Eh.,Wasn't very user friendly to my 9-year-old son. Can't remember where to click for the different functions. Not easily discernible.
5,Each segment is great for kids!,"This is a great DVD! Singing, Drawing and Telephones are the three segments in this Elmo's World DVD. Thanks to the Drawing segment, my daughter has really become more interested in drawing and coloring. I'd say that has been the most educational part of the dvd. Singing is fun, and the tunes are catchy. The telephone segment goes through a history of the telephone, which is highly entertaining. What kid doesn't like playing with telephones? Just make sure you have your play-phone handy so they can play right along with Elmo's World. If your child loves Elmo, this DVD is a great pick!"
5,my daughter loves this DVD,"I have to say that this is a great video, it shows a lot of Elmo and thats whats most important in making my 21 month old happy, lots of Elmo."
4,Cute,"Pretty cool video, but our 2-year-old is out of his elmo phase for now. He seems to prefer Leap Frog and Word World. Time will tell. Personally, I wish there was more Elmo in Elmo vids."
3,My toddler loves this.,"""Elmo's World"" is a collection of skits that are all Elmo, the cute little furry red monster of recent years on Sesame Street.My son is 20 months old and loves this video. He has learned the word ""telephone"" from it, which is not an easy word for a child of this age. Each skit is dedicated to a different topic - singing, drawing, and telephones.Elmo asks questions such as ""who can sing?"", ""what doesn't draw?"" and ""how does the telephone work?"" Even though some of Elmo's background art work for his world is a bit hard on the eyes, this is a great introduction to these topics for the ages 2 and under.For me, it is too much Elmo, but it really isn't for me now, is it?I recommend for the toddlers!!"
4,transition piece,"This book, the sequel to Return to Isis, is not as good as the first, but that could be due to the fact that the characters are already familiar. There's none of the drama of the first book of discovering who these people are, unless you count the villain who shows up in this book and you don't see enough of her to get a feel for her except for pure evil. The third book in the series probably has the excitement as Kali has to deal with the victim and Whit has to deal with that. There is some development of other characters, so this very much has the feel of a transition piece. It seems as if this was a two book idea that got divided into three. The story is interesting though and has the comfort of familiar figures and watching them develop. Like any series, you have to read it to understand where the next one is going."
5,Dangerous on the Street or in your CD Player,"Sure, she retreads some material from her first album, but she's really just picking up where she left off...more biting, inwardly satirical lyrics with a rock sound track. Not for ""normal"" listeners either. Surprisingly good."
1,Poor quality,"This version of Cyrano is my favorite, but the quality of this DVD is very poor - the video is dark and grainy. I have a VHS published by Republic Pictures Home Video which is totally superior.Also, on my Sony DVD player this DVD overwrites the internal image the player displays when you hit 'stop' - with a picture of a busty woman. Totally unprofessional.AVOID, and hope someone else puts this wonderful film out on DVD."
5,"Gimme the book, lose the dust jacket...","This is the third in the Future History-type series that Michael Flynn started in Firestar. It may well be the best yet, if you enjoy hard science SF with deep people underneath the glitter and steel. However, the dust jacket, with it's somewhat ludicrous '40's-retro look 'space suits', is a big disappointment. If I had never read any of Flynn's other works in the series, I would have passed on it, giving it a WIDE berth to make sure I didn't get seasick (or spacesick) -- and therefore missed an excellent read. In fact, I finished it for the first time two days after it came in from Amazon. (I had to finish what I was reading at the time.) That was last week; I just finished re-reading the first two books, so now I have to go back again and read it in sequence, to link everything up properly. But I gotta get rid of that cover..."
3,Good remaster,"Don't think many people need an introduction to the album, so I'll go ahead with the quality. I believe I also placed a review earlier, but it might have been under the wrong version. Basically the sound quality absolutely kills Deadly Sting. Totally demolishes. The only problem is that the remastering exploses some flaws, and there's clicks in track 2 similar to those in some Priest remasters.Hey You is also different then the old Rockers N Ballads cd. For one, it's cut to 3:40. The other part is that it sounds a lot less organized. It kinda goes all over the place, and the vocals sound like they're barely competing with the music. They're much easier to hear on the old cd. Hopefully that one will sound better when I get that remaster."
1,this guy can't explain sand to a desert,"in the beginning of this book the author says he's going to explain why things are done the way they are, yeah right...you have to re-read the text over and over before you get the gist of what's going on and his teaching style is horrible...i'm gunna go buy an Open GL book..."
2,"Bad coding style, poorly organized, good information","The sample code uses variable names very poorly. You constantly have to verify what types of object instances they represent, and whether or not they are pointers. You cannot just read the text without the sample code. In fact the samples only loosely adhere to the chapter contents. But with extra effort you can piece the general disorganization together and gain some benefit."
3,"Great condition, but the book was ok","The book was in great condition, but it was more for people in the military or moving parents or have kids. None of which I needed it for. Just a move, for the first time. More detailed for others not for me."
1,Unadulterated sludge,"Expressionless ""animation."" Lighting effects which would best be described as pallid. Modeling and character design straight out of a bad Dreamcast or Playstation 2 game. A screenplay that is, by turns, smarmy, banal and insensible. Avoid at all costs, unless you want to have nightmares about opalescent polygonal sprites with dead eyes and rigor mortis posture spouting inane faux-saucy dialog."
5,Nice white noise cymbal,"This cymbal is a nice and very close alternative to the Sabian Max Stax Low. Being it is a single cymbal, the decay is a little longer, but not by much. I am basing this on playing it in my game room. In a live setting, you probably wouldn't even notice the slightly longer decay. At $100 vs. $400, this is a great deal. Being it is an accent cymbal, you just need to keep in mind not to ""crush"" it, but rather use a low to medium stroke.I have an old 14"" Paiste 2000 Reflector high hat bottom that I stacked it on and it definitely kills all decay, but doesn't sound that great stand alone. It sounds like hitting a garbage can top. In a live setting only would I try to stack it; however, I would definitely try it first stand alone because it sounds that good and convincing.Also, it has a nice shiny finish to it as well. Not briliant, but definitely looks great under stage lights.I highly recommend this cymbal."
3,North States Diamond Mesh Pressure Mount Gate is OK,"The Pressure Mount North States Diamond Mesh Wood Gate works fine for our needs. The cats can come and go; the dog can't get at the litter pan. It would be better if it fit tightly in the door frame, but a shim took care of the problem."
2,Piece of junk,I purchased this to block my puppy from room with the litter box. Surprisingly difficult to get set up enough to the point that it actually stays up. I'm constantly readjusting it from sliding down the wall and have it propped up with a footstool and box to allow for the cats to crawl under. It works for now with me watching the dog but if she becomes determined she'll knock it down in a heart beat. I wouldn't use with children!
3,You get what you pay for.,"If you want something really sturdy, this is not it. If you are keeping pets at bay, it's okay, but i wouldn't recommend it for keeping children. It is flimsy construction."
4,Works great in my small door way,"I have a 30"" door way to block. It works great. I can see how some people would have a problem with large doors or hallways."
1,Junk,When trying to expand or collapse the gate it falls apart. I have other gates that are better constructed than this one....wont buy from this company again.
4,"Good quality for the price, very small.",I purchased this not thinking about how small this really is. Any dog is going to be able to jump this gate if it's flat to the ground. Luckily I was able to locate it far enough off the ground so that my lab couldn't go under or over it. Overall this is very good quality for the price.
1,Don't make them like they use to,Worked well for about 3 days before it started to fall apart - only moved it about twice a day. Have had to use pliers to bend the fasteners back to their correct position. Screws started to come loose. Snaps on top keep coming apart and have to put them back together. Used this product several years ago when my youngest was a toddler and they held up OK then. Don't make them like they use to.
4,Works well - a bit flimsy until set up firmly,"Definitely a workable product for the price -- this can be a bit irritating until you get it set up nice and tight in the doorway you are using. I recommend marking with a pencil the notch where you'll use it most because adjusting it is annoying if you are in a hurry. That said, the price is right and this definitely works. I'd say it's better in a place where you can set it up and leave it rather than a place where you will be constantly taking it up and down."
1,Wow,"....And I thought Down was bad, do not buy this album expecting Pantera. Maybe i expect too much from the leader of the best metal band ever but this album is pure garbage, I threw it out the window of my car after listening to the first 4 songs"
1,Good Phil / Bad Music,I bought this album to follow Phil Anselmo. His lyrics sound good and hardcore but the music lacks any headbanging rhythm. Too many tempo changes to follow. Phil should stick to vocals only. Leave the guitar to Dime. Ohh wait he's not in the band. Too bad for Phil. I only listened to it about three times.
4,DIE FOR ME!!! KILL YOURSELF!!!,"i think the folks who say his voice sounds bad or worn out are simply confused - his voice tone is deliberate - this isn't supposed to be melodic death metal or anything - its more hardcore punk influenced than anything - his voice is fitting to the music and this album is very high energy and fast-paced - its raw and its a hailstorm of hatred and angst - indeed, i like this album - phil screeches like no other - 'personal insult' is the best song - it crunches and scrapes and changes pace a couple times and on top of it all, makes fun of JIHAD - hahaha"
3,Some Sympathy,"As an album it's very repettitive kinda punkish metal, but also compared to Use Once and Destroy it's even worse. I was skeptical when Phil made a new band, but with the release of Use Once and Destroy I had no need to worry until now. I really don't think this band'll go anywhere compared to Down and Pantera. I love Phil as a metal vocalist and hey with these guys he sounds even heavier, but everything's just to basic."
1,What are these other people listening to?,"I can't even describe how bad these guys are. It seems as if they picked up their junk and everyone tried to play the worst riffs they could think of and then they put it all together and Phil started screaming over it. Actually some songs, such as ""Destruction of a Person"" start off decent, but then out of nowhere an aweful off-time circus riff comes in with Phil talking over it and then it further degenerates into another crappy riff and Phil starts screaming. The musical transitions don't fit or make sense, and they try to play heavy music with an oldschool punk sounding drum and guitar tone. The whole sound is very sloppy and very disorganized. I see that this will prevent it from becoming ""corporate"" or mainstream or whatever Phil wanted it to be, but it sucks. If you liked Pantera, Down, or any other hardcore or rock bands, don't waste your time with Superjoint."
4,please,"stop crying. The cds good. What do you expect? Phil flat out said SJR is a band thats ment for straight foward hardcore music. Its just the way the style is. Its not a ""side project"" band its a actual band now. Pantera are done with, which sucks, mainly due to the fact that i never got a chance to see them live, but other then that its fine. They ran their time and gave us some fine music. SJR isnt ment to have melodic parts to it, so why even start to think it might? Granted the production isnt the best, but so what. SJR's live show is full of power and nonstop metal. If you dont enjoy the cd try checking them out live, their better that way."
1,very weak.,"these dudes didn't put alot of effort into this album. the guitar riffs are lame, and phil's vocals suck. phil needs to lay off the heroin, it's interfering with his creativity. dress like a target has to be the worst song ever. the only song even worth a listen is waiting for the turning point. use once and destroy was so much better. buy that one instead of this peice of garbage. please don't waste your hard earned cash on this album."
3,Maximizer Enterprise,"I run a busy and productive marketing division and we have run Maximizer Enterprize since the beginning or our days. Because of some specific limitations we are going to have to look to changing in the near future and are currently sourcing a variety of other CRM systems.Max is great for sorting out the niggley customer problems, but mail merges can be a nightmare and import of address book from outside sources is nigh on impossible unless your a technical wizard. Max can also not be used to run an integrated ecommerce site as some brochures have suggested. It just doesnt have the capabilities within its fields. The word processing software falls short of desirable, and the link to outlook is not always stable. Outlook linkage is not easy but can be done though! The settings for VOIP can be disastrous unless you wish to pay a specialist to come and set them up."
5,Soft Case delivers a great read.,"Soft Case is full of surprises.Soft Case has a very realistic feel. It captures the essence of a New York City police detective and the case he investigates with excellent characterization and a strong plot. The story is believable and compelling. I am looking forward to receiving the next book by this author, Time Stand Still."
4,"Good camera, but I like SD600 better","I got this camera for Christmas, but returned it because the SD600 is smaller and has one improvement over this one... the videos.The issue is this camera makes an annoying clicking noise during videos, and it shows up on the files when you watch them on your computer. The reason for this is the microphone inside picks up the sounds of the camera's internal pieces clicking and whirring. The SD600 does NOT have this issue with videos.Buy the SD600 instead!"
4,download problem,A540 is great but I can't download into cpu with UBS cords or card reader.Something about non-compatability of my 2002 Gateway and softwear?
5,Canon Powershot A540,"Though this review might prove a bias view toward Cannon products, I found their cameras to be very user friendly. The picture quality is superb for the non-professional photographer and with the easy upload to any personal computer, one can view their masterpieces in no time.On the downside, it would have been nicer if the product came with a larger SD card."
1,Very Bad Battery Life,There is an open recall on this camera if your battery door hinge spring is defective/misaligned. Take a look at this wepage:[...]The recall applies to 530 and 540 models with certain serial numbers or if your hinge appears as defective.
4,Great Quality,I've been using this camera for close to 2 years now and have been impressed with it's durability and image quality. I find it is not the best in low lighting situations but over all this camera has helped me capture some awesome images. I will be hanging on to it even though I'm upgrading to and SLR soon - a good point and shoot is invaluable.
4,Canon PowerShot A540 Review,The picture sometimes turn out blurry. The auto fucus is not the greatest.Overall I am happy with the camera.
4,Good solid camera with excellent features,"I would recommend this camera in the sub $200 price range. Easy to use, multiple settings and user friendLY controls. I am very happy with this camera."
4,Great Camera,I love my power shot A 540. It take great pictures and allows you to go all the way to full manual to experiment. It does make some red eyes but all of them do. Just remove the red eyes with their software or photoshop. You will be pleased with the picture quality.
4,ok now,the first one i got kept flashing low battery. so after calling and getting help from canon i had to send camera back. they sent me another one but not until i called to see when the next one would be sent. i love the camera and did get in time for a family get together. i like the how quick it takes and the front is not straight across. its easier to hang onto with one hand. i did not get it until 6 days ago so i have not had the time to figure out all settings. i like the quality of pictures and so far i would recommend it to others. they did send me a label to return first camera so i didnt have to pay postage.
4,great little camera,"Easy to use right out of the box. Good pictures. Good size. Used the batteries very quickly, though."
4,Good Option,"An excelent camera for a very good price.In my opinion the only problem is the Flash, which takes to much time to be ready and it is not very powerfull."
2,Stuck Lens Cover,"I am a long time owner of Canon SLRs, but I have to admit that I am not impressed with their Powershot ""A"" line. I have had a number of models, three of which I had lens cover problems with (they do not fully open). I've ruined a lot of pictures with this problem. Canon could seem not to care less. I also find that I hate having to flip a switch to go into review mode, as the lens retracts. That's completely lame. I have also found the menus to be non-intuitive, especially around picture management (delete, etc). All in all, despite the raves about picture quality, I think this is an inferior product from a human factors and build quality standpoint. I would not recommend it, nor will I buy another Canon A series camera."
1,Dont bother,"As with most anti prophetic books the authors present their arguments very ""logically"" but falsly. Any reader needs to simple ask is the model the authors use to interpret scripture the SAME or DIFFERENT methodology that Moses, Joshua, Jesus the Apostles and used? Clearly its NOT. As such, logic and rationality reject that methodology as incorrect. Yet of course the authors refuse to even ask this question openly. As it would undermine their preconcieved theories. Not worth the time to read."
3,QUALITY IS...O.K.,There wasn't alot of hiss on either movie. The image quality is nothing to write home about. It's just good enough to keep you from straining your eyes.
5,Forever Young.,"I always listen to this tape and each time I listen, I descover something new. Great attorney. Great ideas. Best presentation."
3,Review,The author certainly thinks very highly of himself... some good concepts but don't waste your time if you are looking for something with real application possibilities...
1,One of the worst books ever.,"The only reason I gave this even one star is because the software program wouldn't accept zero stars. Spence never even comes close to delivering the alluring promise of the title. For example, he advises the reader to practice public speaking in front of an audience. Fine. And if you can't find an audience for practicing? He advises you to ""create"" one. He actually suggests that you go into a restaurant, stand up on a chair, clink a spoon on a glass to command attention and announce to the room that you need to practice speaking to them so please indulge you!!! Is he nuts? You'd get pelted with bread-sticks until the waiters gave you the bum's rush and heave-ho. It seems that he dictated this into a tape-recorder over a weekend, then nobody bothered to edit this ill-reasoned garble. How could this ever get onto best-sellers lists? Buckskin Bob has snowed them again."
5,This guy knows his stuff,I first read random chapters of this book about 15 years ago off my sister's shelf. There were a couple things that I read that had been on my mind for more than a decade.I finally decided to buy this book when I happened across it and I was not disappointed. The plain simple logic of how people and situations unfold is made so clear that you can't believe you hadn't noticed it every day.Lawyers and soon to be lawyers should definitely read this book (even though I'm not in the field of law).
2,"Rambling, at times egomaniacal, but with some wisdom","Gerry Spence, the face you see on TV almost every time the initials ""O.J."" come up, has proven himself endearing to juries, and to television viewers, as the down-home country lawyer. Even among attorneys (I am one) he is something of a mythical figure. But this book shows him as something of a confused rambler. I DID get much valuable information about how to look for what other people want when negotiating, but I did NOT get ""how to argue and win every time."" I DID get the impression that Spence needs help, though."
4,A Must Read !,"This book changed my life. I had all these thoughts wondering in my head, and Mr. Spence displayed them out on paper in such a wonderful story manner. Anyone who knows anything about people skills, will know the importance of presenting thoughts in a story form. People love stories, they feel for stories, and most of all, they remember stories. This is an important point in Mr. Spence's book. His stories are sensational with compelling arguments. This is not a miracle book that can make an antisocial person into a great orator. You must have some ablity to convey your message. And if you do, this is the book for you. It can change your life. You will see others arguments in a different light. The best argument lets the winner win, without allowing the loser to truly lose. I love this book, just read it, you'll see."
3,"Good strategies, but there are better","I thought it would be interesting to read the advice of one of America's top lawyers. While Spence included much insight into the construction of a good argument, he failed to appeal to persons who are not seriously introverted and self-conscious. As a law student I think this book is of very little use to trial lawyers and more useful for the average (maybe afflicted with inferiority complex) person. I liked his analysis of the power of prejudice. If you are interested in the workings of the mind of one of America's top lawyers, than I suggest you read this book. If not, read Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""--it's a much better argument helper."
5,"very deep, fast reading, and intelligent","Exactly what the world needs, to understand when to argue andwhen not to. It also explains the importance of debate in oursociety."
2,"A ""how to"" book for environmentalists and religion bashers","I wasnt going to give a review on this book until I noticed that the overall rating was 4 stars and some unfortunate soul might be suckered into buying it.Bottom line is that I didnt feel any more prepared for negotiating after I read it. It might be usesful for another lawyer (instead of an MBA) arguing to 12 silent jurors, but not to a professional.Please save yourself by looking elsewhere."
2,not the best anitbullying book,This book is written like a comic but it is not really funny and does not teach great strategies on handling bullies. I would dskip this one or go to the library as there are better books availablee
3,"Not bad, but..........","This album starts off well with ""Somewhere in the World"" but loses steam afterwards. While Corrine Drewery's rich contralto voice is still there, this is a somewhat different style of music than their debut album ""It's Better to Travel"" from 10 years before. And it sets a different mood as well. ""Retro"" seemed to be a big thing in the 90's and into the new millenium as well. And that's what a lot of this album is--songs with a late 60's to early 70's flavor including the remake of ""Stoned Soul Picnic"". If you buy this CD because you liked ""It's Better to Travel"", you will be disappointed. That being said, not a bad listen, but don't buy this album just because you liked earlier Swingout Sister CD's."
3,not a reference-book,"nicely made book about some ghost-films, but far away from being a reference-work-book. To many important ghostfilms are missing and not even mentioned,like ""Ghost"", ""Amityville"", Rene Clair's ""The Gost goes West"" or the ""Topper""films with Cary Grant."
5,Power Acoustik C3184 3-Way Electronic Crossover,Very good crossover for the price... Carries some very good features and controls... No way the price can be beat...
2,not that great,this manual is not worth the money haynes manual more indepth with wiring diagrams. dont waste ur money.look online and buy the accutal ford manual for your mustang
3,"A good read, but no new revelations..","I enjoyed reading this book, and I also enjoyed reading ""Selling the Invisible"". However, I don't see anything remarkably different or new in this book vs. the first one. Basically just warmed-over leftovers from his first book. A couple of Beckwith's points I stongly disagree with: 1) ""Admit a weakness to a prospective customer"" and 2)""Word-of-mouth doesn't work"". Give me a break! What's the point in revealing a weakness to a customer? And since when did word-of-mouth didn't work? I have a CPA practice, I don't advertise, therefore most of my customers are via networking & referrals (""word-of-mouth""). Beckwith is wrong about those points! Read his first book - ""Selling the Invisible"" - and skip the other two."
2,Skip This One,"Frankly, most of this book focuses on 2 things:1. Rehashing a lot of ""Selling the Invisible"" (which I'd strongly recommend over this one); and2. A strong argument for building a brand (which, coincidentally, Mr. Beckwith's firm can do for you - who knew?)If you've read ""Selling the Invisible,"" there are about half a dozen or so nuggets of wisdom in this book; you need to make the decision if that's worth your money or not."
3,"Over-Reaches and Repeats Material from ""Selling the Invisible""","As a follow up book to the excellent ""Selling the Invisible,"" I thought this book fell somewhat short of the mark. It rehashed some warmed over material from ""Selling the Invisible."" It lingered on some topics - like picking a company name - that I'm not sure were totally germane to the book's title.There are some excellent sections on the importance of picking a great receptionist.This is not a bad book, but its repetitive nature and off-topic meanderings earn it a three-star rating in my view, as contrasted with the five stars I gave ""Selling the Invisible.""Like all of Beckwith's books, this one is very reader-friendly with bite-sized chapters you can knock off quickly."
2,safflower,"did not do what it said it would,do, like getting rid of stomach fat and losing weight. compared to chia seed safflower oil is the loser."
1,I Didn't Lose A Pound With This Product !!!,If you're buying this product in hopes of losing weight... DON'T!!! I used the whole bottle as directed and all I lost was my money.
3,Safflower Oil,"I am following a Blood type diet and it says I should not use this product, so I have not."
5,Think Back,"Go Ask Mom had so many funny events, mostly the pranks. The illustrations were awesome. I met Justin Matott and he said he looked like the boy and that he was actually bullied like me. Very funny and entertaining to read!"
1,Can't get it!,"This dealer will not ship to Alaska, so I could not buy the item (since I live in Alaska)."
4,wasn't what i expected but still worked well,"I had purchased this item thinking it was a full sized Stanley remote, so you can imagine my surprise when I open my package in the mail to find a little keychain. It turns out the item is actually a keychain size, fully functional version of the original remote. It works as planned but I just wish that this was more apparent."
5,Exactly what we wanted,We have an old garage door opener. When my husband put my transmitter on the roof of the car and drove away it was shattered. Looking around we could only find transmitters for newer units. So we were overjoyed to find the exact replica of ours on Amazon. We ordered two as the other one we had was getting weak. Shipping was immediate. What else can I say? They're perfect!!
5,Same as orginal,"When I purchased the item I wasn't sure it would work with my model of garage door. When I receive it, it was very easy to program the switches, and now it is working as good as the orginal one. I would definitely purchase another one if I needed one."
4,Great flag for the Price,"This is a great flag for $5. Not the best quality, but it does the job for an indoor wall hanging piece."
5,Perfect,"I ordered five of the Bavaria National Country flags for an Oktoberfest party. They arrived quickly, the quality was very good and the price was right. They were just perfect to set the tone of our party."
1,unhappy,This is my second purcharse and they gave me diferent song and on this album the songs comes out of order.
2,"FLAT, UNINSPIRED AND COMMERCIAL","This live release by Scoprions is a funny thing. It has great songs, but they are played in a terrible formulatic way, totally without passion. Maybe it's the mixing, I don't know. Anyway, compare it with Scoprions previous live album, ""TOKYO TAPES"", and you'll see the difference."
1,Scream On,"To tell the truth, the Scorpions sound pretty bad even when they're in the studio, live they are simply punishing. Famed for the guitar heroics of Michael Schenker, the band really does not offer much else. They fill in all the appropriate blanks for an eights metal band, bad hair, bad singing, bad lyrics and plenty o screamin. Similar to UFO, AC/DC and Black Sabbath, they will probably please fans of that sort of noxious noise. All others can do without."
5,The beginning for most Scorpions fans!,"I had been listening to the Scorpions for quite some time prior to the release of this album, but most Scorpions fans really got into them due to this album. I have had the unique opportunity to see them in concert in Germany as well as in the US and I must say the German tours are a lot better. Anyway, there are a lot of number one hits on this album in my opinion and it really got them noticed."
3,A documentary about Volcanoes around the Pacific Rim,"The previous reviewer mistakenly wrote a review of a martial arts movie with the same name...Ring of Fire. This video however, is a documentary regarding the volcanoes and earthquakes around the Pacific Rim and the Hawaiian Islands. The video is very well done, as most of it was taken from an IMAX movie theater presentation. It has many great shots of lava streams, erruptions, and other related scenes -- such as the earthquake damage in San Franciso as the result of the 1989 earthquake. Overall it is well done and a nice documentary, but a bit pricey for only 40 minutes of video."
3,Disappointed,"I was excited to give this to my wife for her birthday, but disappointed in the quality of the rack when I received it. I think the description should have indicated that it is made of cheap pine wood and only weighs a few ounces. The wood is chipped where the holes are drilled. I'm telling you, this looks like it cost $1 to make! It is shipped in parts and you put it together yourself. The rack does just what it is intended to do and my wife said she'll keep it. But I think it's way overpriced at $18.50, should be more like $5!"
3,Beading With Peyote Stitch,"I think this book is good for all the ways you can work with peyote stitch. Each variation of stitch is explained, and diagrammed. The techniques use 23 of the available 111 pages. The chapter on supplies is 10 pages long. There are 10 projects in the book and I considered them all to be ugly. The Gallery section of the book is 42 pages long, a waste of time and book space. More projects could have been offered, and more time could have been spent on the techniques. If you want to learn all the peyote stitches this is a good reference. I however cannot recommend it because of the wasted space taken up by Gallery photos."
2,Poor Sound Mars Great Film,"Beware of this version of the film. Lousy sound quality. Often cuts out. Buy another verson of the DVD. Its sad, because it s a wonderful film."
5,LIVE at best!!,"this song is definately a great track almost every loves it it got to and Debuted at 2 in Australia and its definately a beautiful track,Fragile live is definately a beauty of a live track, definately has the FragilenessLAST NIGHT ON EARTH LIVE, this is the thing thats worth it, its the alternate version of LNOE and its definately what everyone agrees is a beautifully vocalised and produced, it definately has a vulnibility that the album version doesn't, WORTH IT specially if you have Mastaken Identity or in fact any Delta Goodrem single or album, actually this should be a must-have if you have Mastaken Identity album!!Last NIght on earth live also was the concert i went to so its definately a fondness for me!!Love,Katy"
4,Written for both the Novice and Experienced Sportsman,"Canoe-Fishing New York Rivers and Streams is an easily readable book full of basic canoeing and fishing skills. Mr. Keesler has a talent for sharing information through his writings that is easily understood by all, especially the beginner sportsman. The book takes you through steps of what to look for in a canoe, equipment needed, and basic canoeing skills. The book identifies waters that are proven fishable and wildlife that may be viewed. Canoe-Fishing New York Rivers and Streams is a great starter book for interested sportpersons thniking about exploring a new sport. A must read book for the novice."
4,Good alternative to the requested gift!,"My daughter (8)wanted an Easy Bake oven for Christmas, but I didn't. I thought it would be more fun to have her own bakeware, since what she really likes is mixing up the batter and then decorating. It turned out to be a great choice. The pans are heavy and well-made and the cakes slipped right out. She really liked the idea of having her own pans and even did the clean-up. The only problem we had was overfilling the pans, so the cakes were really big, but that's operator error! We also bought the decorating kit."
4,It worked right out of the box,"With Windows Vista n MS Flight Sim X it was recognized with no problem. I've only used it once (testing). The sim took longer to load, but once it started it worked very nice. I just went to the control assignment panel and reassigned the buttons that came as defaults. I hope it keeps working like that for years to come.Took off in a Baron n tried simulated eng failures. The response was just as close as real life (remember this is a sim).With regard to [...], 0 complaints. It was delivered in the estimated day in perfect conditions.I'm a software engineer and multieng rated pilot."
3,Its the only thing going :(,"The levers are actually pretty small. Not very realistic at all. It was VERY difficult to calibrate. I had to resort to google to find out why some of the assignments (reverse thrust) didnt work properly until I adjusted the factory default settings. I guess I was lucky to run across a thread with someone else having the same problem.I use it for FS9. Its the only thing going at a reasonable price so what can you do? I reccommend it, but its not really that great. I'm not going to rave about it."
1,Misleading picture,"When I ordered this Rubbermaid drainer tray I did so based on the picture of an old style drainer tray shown in the listing. But what I received was the flimsy, lightweight, new style rubbermaid tray. It is completely unacceptable. The marketer, Deerso, is misleading customers by displaying an old style product and then sending something all together different."
4,"Bought it for outdoors, size was important","The dimensional information was accurate, it should work well out on the outdoor kitchen. I plan to use it with the Twin Sink Dish Drainer when I am cooking outdoors"
3,Poor Korean print,"The quality of this DVD is pretty poor. It comes from Korea and I am not sure what has happened with it but it is extremely rough. The Chariot Race, while still exciting seems like it is not synchronized well. The story is still great and I am a die hard Silent Movie fan so I won't send it back but just beware. I have heard that the VHS version is much better but I don't know that for sure.Don't be scared off by the Korean writing all over it. It will make you think you received the wrong copy. The print is in english. I was afraid to open it at first, and then not be able to return it if necessary. I took a chance and it is in english. I enjoyed it for it's cinematic historical value but it is very poorly copied. Any silent movie buff is used to these restored movies to be not up to any current standards and we love them anyway, but this one is pretty bad."
1,Film: 5 stars; DVD version: one star,"This review does not deal on the Fred Niblo film which is a classic of all times but it refers to this AWFUL copy. This 1925-BEN HUR deserved a much better DVD treatment. This is an Asian copy from a TV channel since you even get the channel logo in some scenes! It's simply awful! The copy is FAR from being DVD quality: it actually looks as a terribly poor VHS copy from the 80's. Unless you are in great need to see this, try to avoid it. It's one of the worst copies I've ever bought of a silent classic. This tawdry copy actually deserves no stars at all, but as such a category does not exist, let's give it one undeserved star."
3,Irene Dunne Fan,"I wanted to see some of the long forgotten work of Irene Dunne. The films were dated, but wonderful."
5,"Hot, Hot, Hot Milo Zizzles","Milo Z is hotter than a sweatband in a fireman's helmet! In leather, satin, or tank top, the music doesn't have to be on and I'm already pumped up!!!"
1,PAL,I don't see it listed anywhere that this a PAL dvd. My dvd player will not play PAL region DVDs. So I'm unable to watch it on my television and now I'm returning this product.They should note that it is PAL only. Does anyone know if there is an NTSC version available?
2,Wrong Product Sent,The description of the product on Amazon is the Precept Lady S III Pearl Series. They did not send me pearl series but the regular Lady S III.
4,First Classic Crue Album,"This is a true 80s Metal Classic, the musicianship is tight, as well as the lyrical skills of the band [Notably Nikky Sixx]. From the Mood-Setting Openeing track to the final moments, the album flows well, with very few silly or unfocused moments. The title track [9/10], God Bless the Children of the Beast [10/10, God-Awesome Intrumental], Ten Seconds to Love [8/10], and Too Young to Fall in Love [8.5/10] are the major highlights, and their take on the Beatle's Helter Skelter is interesting, to say the least. Very Cool, Very Solid."
5,Great CD,This album is by far the Crue's best. All the songs are great and so catchy that over 20 years later I still remember all the lyrics. I think musically this was the best one as well. Better than most of the rest of the 80's metal/hard rock released at this time.
5,very satanic!,i like 'em very much! the lyrics are very satanic! especailly i like the title track! it is a very good one! the vocals are great ones too!
3,Good love story,"Omar, I enjoyed reading Sweet St. Louis but I must say it took me some time to get into the story. The first 200 pages were boring to me but after page 200 I was deep into the story. I can really relate to Sharron as a female dealing with the games men play over and over. I didn't like what Ant did to Diane but that happens all the time. Celena and Tony were both dealing with alot of issues. This is a great book for anyone that is thinking about giving up the player role and getting serious with that special someone.Omar keep the faith and be blessed."
2,This was madness,"Tyree's last book Single Mom was a nice break from the normal type of reading that I do, but Sweet St. Louis was just plain silly. This was the slowest moving book I have ever read before in my life, finishing this book was like getting teeth pulled; you don't want to do it, but since you have already paid for it, you really don't have a choice. How many times could Sharron remind Ant of the silly line that he used? How many times would he fall for it? And for the record, I don't know anyone like Sharron or Ant. This was just madness."
3,thought it would be better as a paperback !,"I am a fan of Omar Tyree but I thought Sweet St. Louis was not all that I expected ! I was so hyped up with the pick up line that I was compelled to buy and read it now ! You know the line , ""A piece of me for a piece of you.""I still get hyped just thinking about it !I just felt the book would have been better had it been a paperback or tradesize book ! This is in no way meant to crticise the author or story! I just felt the need to share , especially when you buy as many hardcover books as I do ! I usually do not comment on a book unless it is a 4or 5* ! I DID find the story hard to but down during the last 100 to 75 pages ! Not a bad story just better in paperback ! IMO"
2,Sweet St. Louis,"I recently had the opportunity to read Omar Tyree's latest book ""Sweet St. Louis."" Boy! was I disappointed. This book is not only slow moving --but boring to say the least. I was a big fan of two of his books ""Flyy Girl and A Do Right Man."" This book does not come close. Since I took this book out of the library, I can be glad that I did not pay for it. I did not finish this book, because I kept falling asleep while trying to read it. For those of you who want to read thisbook, my advice is to borrow the book from the library. This way you won't lose any money if you are disappointed. For the rest of you who are brave enough to read this book, I suggest also, that you use it as late night read -- you are bound to fall asleep before you finish each chapter. I should know -- I stopped trying to read this book after the 5th chapter."
2,Nice Start....Predictable Ending,"""A Piece of Me for a Piece of You"".... Now there's a line for you. The story of Ant and Sharron is as old as time - Boy yells out the car window to a woman who is, in essence, 'too good for him'; Girl falls for ruff-neck boy anyway; boy continues to be a playa, playa ('cause that's what they do); boy gets in trouble; Girl's man-hating friend dogs out the boy; sistah stands by her man - they live happily ever after. Nothing too out of the ordinary in this book. Tone's and Celena's characters helped to add some excitement to the monotony - but in the end - the story is too predictable and there just wasn't enough to keep me intrigued. I would really rate this about 1 and a half stars - but that wasn't one of my options, so I rounded up to two!"
2,Free Shipping.....YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!,Amazon advertised free shipping so I took the Bait. I will not use AMAZON again. I deal with liars all day at work. I do not need to deal with more over the computer.________Amazon's reasoning: The Item was not from their inventory. So What! I feel they should back their word up and pay the shipping costs! Can I get a Hell Yeah?
1,Good for religious folks who want religion instead of truth- God is Truth,"The book can help people who have no knowledge or understanding of God's truth, most of the scriptures written in the book are convenient to fit the doctrine the author wants others to believe it his way yet ignores other scriptures that are more important of how our Heavenly Father wants us to live and grow. This book is good for those who wish to be programmed and controlled by religious people."
2,Flags,Flags were much smaller than I had anticipated. I guess I didn't look at the size. Too small to be practical.
1,Not what is shown,"When I initially installed the fence it came with wire stems on the flags (as shown in the picture when ordering) and the flags were larger. This last set I purchased were plastic and very small. I agree with another reviewer, the plastic is too hard to stick in the ground. I returned them immediately."
1,Cheap in every way,"I have an Invisible Fence brand fence, which I had to re-install in my new home when I moved. I re-installed the fence myself to save about 400.00 and was trying to find a less expensive way to mark the new fence line for the dogs by buying a cheaper set of flags. BAD mistake. These flags are probably 1/4 the size of the Invisible Fence brand flags and are VERY poorly made. Even the poles of the flags are made of very flimsy plastic that is extremely difficult to even place into the ground. End result of these flags: The flags are too small for the dogs to notice and it nearly killed me trying to get them stuck in the ground due to the cheap material used to make the poles. Don't buy this product."
4,Pretty good soul music,"I like this music, although only two of the songs I really enjoy. The rest of the CD is ok."
1,Juvenile and crass,"I was looking for a book to help my teen transition into high school. This was a poor choice in books. Thankfully, I read it before I gave it to her to read.As another reviewer pointed out, how to handle walking in on your parents making love is not a topic I wanted to cover with her, nor was the art of pulling your hair off the soap before you leave the shower.I found this book juvenile at best, crass and vulgar at worst. It advises that ""parents just need to lighten up"" rather than teaching kids to respect their parents.It's written to teens, but rather than raising them up to a higher level, it panders to their own immaturity and lack of tact.Waste of money ... it's on its way back as I type."
2,Not What I Consider Good Manners or Ethical,"Yes, the sexual advice would be best left to another book. But that subject aside, this book specifically says that if a teacher gives you 100 homework questions and you do 50 questions and your friend does 50 questions and you switch papers and give each other the answers that is not cheating that is ""being efficent"". Really? Not in my classroom.This book takes the approach that really teens are smarter than adults, but humor the adults and do these things they call ""polite"" because that is just easier to deal with the tired old fashion fools that way. This author portrays authority figures in a poor light."
5,PERFECT SIZE for my SentrySafe,PERFECT SIZE TO REPLACE THE PLASTIC BOX IN MY SentrySafe. This is a well built metal box and the right size for SentrySafes. I've had a SentrySafe for several years and the only thing I didn't like about it is the plastic box that comes in it. The safe is a 2 hour fire safe but having this metal box for valuables and cash in a fiberglass pouch should add another layer of fire protection.I recommend this box. It is well made and a good value for the price.
4,Awesomness,This box is amazing. I put all my valibels in it and its perfect size to hide in a closet. i would recomend this to anyone who is using this for a grage sale of bake sale. The only down fall to it is that it is heavy. Other wise amazing.
5,Another great piece of work from David Coe,"Coe really does a nice job building the intrigue level between the humans and the Qirsi. Definitely a palpable tension between the Qirsi serving as ministers and their respective dukes,etc. That's a credit to Coe.Coe continues to build on the layers he established in the first two books, in particular Grinsa and his relationship to Tavis and Cressane.I definitely would rank Coe's work right up there with the best. He probaby isn't as wide a scope or as deep as Martin and Erikson, but he's very, very good. I Highly recommend that you read this series."
4,Great debut album ... good luck guys.,"I listened today this fantastic album of this new band. I'm a fan of Jack White work. He is a man who dedicates his life to revive the best 60 & 70 hard & acoustic rock. The best example is this past project: White Stripes. I like most of the white stripes albums. I don't listen the work of Brendan Benson ... but I imagine were is the objective of his life. Revive the best Beatles rock. I like both objectives & I hear this two objectives in this debut album. Sounds very familiar, but sounds very mordern in the same time. There are a good mix of styles: Rock in the same style of Led Zeppelin Physical Graffiti, acoustic songs in the style of The Beatles White Album & grounge record process.This album is ideal for rock & indie rock fans, grounge rock fans & lovers of the 70 rock bands.Good luck The Raconteurs. ;)"
3,Still not entirely sure,"Intially, I was on the fence. I was never much for Mr. Benson, but I've been a huge White Stripes fan for years. The thought of Jack White with a full band excited me and scared me at the same time.The result is mixed. Upon my first listen, I wasn't sure what to make of the album when it ended. Today, I also am unsure of what to make of it. It seems inconsistent, but never bad. There are some true standouts (Steady, Hands, Store-Bought Bones) but there's a lot I wouldn't think much of by comparison.Still, it's a solid release. Definitely not the worst album of 2006"
4,not to be missed v. saccharine sweets give me a toothache,"I see Jack White's history all in reverse. Here he is, making obvious chord changes, all in patsy slaphappy mokeys melodies, who, zep and you name it references. Power rock? You did it before, better. Honestly, I dissapprove. He started with Canon fergodsake, on the self titled debut! Have you heard it? Where's the punk gone? Where's the twisted lyrics? What is this 1975 brit smorgasbord?I've turned the disc a few times, and the genius is apparent, as usual. But better to carry through a new authentic self inspired and noncommercial sound than serve me this pop, it is too sweet. The band is tight, the tunes are very well produced and very good, but I am not slayed. Shucks."
3,Not bad,"Better than the White Stripes but not as good as Brendan Benson solo. It's a shame that Brendan isn't receiving more credit for this project. He's a far more talented songwriter than White and still you only hear The Raconteurs referred to as Jack White's band. There are a few gems here such as ""Hands"", ""Together"", and ""Call It a Day"", but much is fairly average. If you're into this record do yourself a favor and buy Benson's three solo albums."
3,Side-work syndrome,"A few songs on here that warrant a look, but overall too much filler-esque work to make for anything above a merely good release."
4,all star band delivers,"It's a little hard to characterize this indie-college rock sound, but given the all-star talent of the band, I'm not at all surprised to find that this is a very creative CD. The hit, ""Steady as She Goes"", caused me to buy the CD, but the rest of the CD is excellent. I'd like to think that this will be an example of 21st Century rock 'n roll that delivered us from the monotonous and largely unoriginal ""alternative"" rock of the 90's. I recommend this CD for 1) fans of the original bands that these Raconteurs come from and 2)fans of 60, 70's and 80's rock who have not listened to anything new in a while."
2,Thought I would love it....,"I own and love CDs of both Brendan Benson and The White Stripes, but I was really disappointed with this CD. The first song, ""Steady as she goes"" is the best on the CD, and the rest are pretty forgettable."
3,just never hit my standards,"it was okay i guess. i had such high hopes after hearing the first single. but was completely let down the rest of the album... no, i wasnt expecting the white stripes, but i wasnt expecting the ""everyman garage band"" either..."
1,umm...no,"There's a song called ""Don't Believe the Hype"". It's not on this album. Don't look for it. It DOES describe this album. Everyone was cheering for this one, saying that Jack White is a genius. Sure, he is. Just listen to the White Stripe's first 4 albums. Rolling Stone magazine said this was better than your best Foghat album. I listened to some Foghat at the store. It's not.White should stick to his original band & do some producing on the side. The Raconteurs were compared (for some odd reason) to bands of the 1970's. It sounds exactly like all the other pop that comes out now. The song ""Broken Boy Soldiers"" was good. Maybe better than most of the songs on the White Stripe's Get Behind Me Satan. Everything else on this album was... well, bad. Long story short, I sold it back after 3 listenings.So, don't believe the hype & don't waste money on this CD."
1,Finished out of duty,"Headhunters made me decide that if a book bores me after the first quarter, put it down--odds are it won't get any better.It was really, really boring. I did read it all, but felt like I had wasted two days doing it.Definitely a one star book."
1,Terrible--just terrible,"This book was so bad, I can't even put it into words. It is the worst book I've ever read, and will NEVER pick up another thing by this author. They're MAKING IT A MOVIE?! OH GOD NO!Save your money. Really. It's that bad."
4,Too unique for words,"Prickly with a voice that grates, there's nothing pretty about the music of Nina Simone. But her phrasing and the all consuming emotion that she gives to the songs makes her own them. Pour yourself a Scotch or two and this album will envelop you like smoke in an old bar when it's cold and dark outside.The choice of songs here has been made by a singer, and if you like art in your interpretations of standards, then this album is meant for you. It's meant for detailed listening. It's moody as moody can be and definitely not for those who get their thrills from the easy smooth sounds of Norah Jones. But if you like singing with emotion and attitude, well it doesn't get any better than Nina. And this collection is very representative of all that Nina could do."
4,"Easily their best album, with a beautifully recorded sound","This group was the follow-up to Steps, founded by Mike Mainieri. The group consists of the following members: Mike Mainieri, Michael Brecker, Eliane Elias, Eddie Gomez and the wonderful Peter Erskine on drums. Except for the last cut all songs are well-crafted, written by different members of the group, with the exception of the lovely ""Pools"", written by the late Don Grolnick. Best cut in my opninion is ""Islands"", with lovely solos by Mike Mainieri and Eliane Elias and the usual perfect flowing drumming of Peter Erskine. Nice bonus is the pristine recording quality. Highly recommended."
5,Works fine....,This is a great thing but is little over-priced. I mostly use it to make dough for tortillas/Rotis and it does a great job as compared to other products which shakes or make noise while doing this heavy task of kneading dough.
2,Cute shoes but very awkward,"I was so excited to get these shoes. The style and price were great. Although, when I recieved them the left shoe was quite a bit larger than the right foot. Unfortunately, I have not worn tthem very much because of the size difference. I should have exchanged them, so make sure you are satisfied before throwing everything away. I never even tried them on until I had a whole outfit prepared."
3,Nothing new,"This book was basically stuff you already know. It includes: breathing, exercise, bettering yourself, and moving on. Nothing extra special to set this book apart from others."
5,Frida:,"Frida: A Biography of Frida Kalho is a great movie. Having read Le Lacuna by Barbara Kingsolver plus Frida by Hayden Herrera I know this movie correctly follows the chronology of her life. The movie maker has used the Mexican setting beautifully in the shooting of this film. Understanding the meaning and the context of Frida's paintings the director has masterfully created ""freeze frames"" which replicate her paintings then made these come to life.Frida was a bright energetic person who suffered tragedy early in life. She was determined not to be forgotten, to overcome her circumstances and to live her life with spirit, with love, with art all around her and with true alegria. Her story is an inspiration."
3,SO SO,"It works, but you still have to have the computer reset at the dealer to get it to function if you replace it yourself... 2000 ZR2 Blazer"
5,"Apple is the BEST, more than you expect!",This is an excelent product. Noise free. beautiful. You can have osx and Windows XP. Is more than you expect!
1,not ready for prime time,I bought two of the new mac minis - one dual core and one single core - and they both crash (with kernel errors) frequently for no apparent reason. I'm returning both and I'll wait until v2 of the intel mac minis.
2,Mostly trite material,"This was my first Torme CD purchase, so I don't know much, but it seems to me that it must be a collection of early material. Most of the songs are trivial, bordering on inane. There must be much better Torme collections, because I know he's better than this."
3,Empty Slate,"The author of this book could accurately be called ""a minimalist's minimalist. The general tone is light and airy. However, for a book published this recently, it suffers from a total absence of irony."
4,Very light,"Tucano Work Out is very light and well manufactured with excellent materials, save the shackles, which had broken, harming the laptop"
2,Simple Review,"Count this as 2.5 stars. Highlights: Every Word Was A Piece Of My Heart, Destination Anywhere, August 7, 4:15. Lowlights: Queen Of New Orleans, It's Just Me. Jon Bon Jovi experimenting and going for a pop sound. While I can appreciate the album and what he's trying accomplish unfortunately it seems like it came out when his voice was at it's weakest - I don't know why. He just doesn't sound anywhere near as good as ""These Days"" and didn't fully regain it until ""Bounce""."
3,Informative book,"Nice informative book that I was left wanting more. This book can have a sequel for the rest of the story. Very basic.But the book is in fine shape for a used article, and arrived ahead of delivery date as with most of the Amazon purchases."
4,A grat introduction,"A great introduction to the more symphonic side of soul-disco, featuring some of the finest disco songs ever written, like ""Bad Luck"", ""Soul Train"" or ""Back Stabbers"". But you also get a thick booklet featuring a brief history of the Philly sound and comments from artists of yesterday and today. A good investment indeed."
1,Philly Sound Review,"Be areware! This CD does not contain the original recordings that were played on the radio or in the clubs. You'll be dis-appointed, just like I was, after shelling out your $$$, because these cuts are not the original version in no way, shape or form."
4,pretty good advice,"While she doesn't reinvent the wheel, Bawden's book is pretty funny and informative. When you take into account that the woman who wrote THE RULES is now getting divorced, this book makes good sense. If you're single, and don't want to be, this is certainly worth a look. It only costs a few bucks, and if you meet one good person because of the advice found here, that's a solid investment. Oh, and men can benefit from some of what's in here, too."
3,Wyborg and its amazing clutch,"Wyborg was the first beyblade I had purchased, now I own over thirty. Wyborg owns a clutch system which, if hit the right way, will switch from endurance mode to attack mode, or vica versa. This change does not occur in every battle because it needs to get hit in the right spot. When it does switch, though, the change is usually noticable as it once was spinning in the center and then, after being hit, goes into the attack doing medium-sized circles around the stadium. This blade is quite fun and may be useful for customizing but in all its performance is not that great. It is a good match with a dragoon s which is not a good thing. Wyborg is, however, a fun beyblade, as well as a dangerous one. My Wyborg has crushed a day old master driger and an hour old driger f. Master driger's attack ring cracked and so did driger f's after they flew out of the stadium. In conclusion, Wyborg is not a beyblade I would get for performance purposes, but it is fun."
5,good original beyblade,My friend Andrew Telepak has this beyblade and it is OK.Just put on trygle's waight ring and it will beat almost any beyblade.The only probelem is the base because the tiny tip almost always goes in the hole in the bottom.After all this is a good beyblade.
2,ugly,The costume has black marker ink on it and was a complete diffrent color than the matching girl costume made no since at all was verry disapointed!
4,great cheesy costume,"Ordered 9 of these costumes and they arrived quickly, as described. Had a great time with my friends. If you're looking for a costume everyone recognizes, this is it. We got mad props from tons of people at the Roc Race in LA 2011."
2,Patio furniture cover,"When I first got the cover, I was satisfied with the material and the appearance. It also did fit my patio table. However I was disappointed after a few showers later. The cover did not stop rain from getting through. In fact it traps water/ moisture under the cover and may do more harm to the furniture. I thought with the cost of the cover it should do better."
5,Total Change,Now Hear This...! This is one of THE BEST Hard Rock Albums I have EVER heard. It matters not to me that everyone wanted to blame John Corabi for the failure of this Album. This was a promo discovery for me. I had heard Motley Crue before and WAS NOT impressed. IT WAS THE SINGER ! When Corabi was dropped into the mix EVERYTHING changed. The other Three members were ripe for this guy. They became a REAL band on this CD. It is the ONLY Motley Crue Album I will ever own. Anyone who wants to hear some KILLER Rock should invest in this CD. It ranks with anything else out there. PRIMO...''Hooligan's Holiday'' alone is worth getting it...but the rest of the CD is absolutely marvelous.
1,Disappointed!,I remember from years past that Trident gum was always long lasting; I was wrong! This gum keeps its flavor for the shortest time; I was extremely disappointed and will never buy Trident Cinnamon gum again.
3,ipanema?,"When I click on the listen sample for 'Girl from Ipanema' I hear Joao Gilberto's version (sung in portugeuese). While I don't want to get into a debate about which is a better (or more politically accepted) version, I just want to get the female sung version of this song that came out in the 60's or 70's. Is that the version on this album and amazon just linked the listen feature to the other version?"
2,An amateur production.,I cannot complain about Astrud - she does a good job. My complaint is with the Verve people. They have produced a very sloppy compilation. The mix is very poor with one track's volume far exceeding the next. Sound levels are all over the place. That sort of improper mix should not happen with today's technological sophistication. It is sloppy work which displays a lack of concern for producing a proper and decent product.
