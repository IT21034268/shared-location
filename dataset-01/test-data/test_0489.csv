4,DOGMATICS ON BOTH SIDES YUK UP AMERICA; CAN THIS UNITE US?,"Let's hope this book lightens things up a little, or else we are in trouble of tearing ourselves apart as a country??"
4,This Is Comedy Dont Take It Seriously,"This is not political commentary, its comedy don't over analyze. Like certain politicians Jon simply states the jokes he believes the American people ""want to hear"" he has no firm stance on his humor. He is clearly a comedic opportunist he ruthlessly targets anything or anyone that might get a laugh. In this book there are more hits then misses .Now for those of you who believe Jon is a non-biased disseminator of useful news and information "" its the comedy channel "" duh!!!"
4,Funny...yet gross,"This book is, basically, a fake textbook from the ""most trusted name in fake news.""This book was absolutely hilarious, but I only give it four stars because of all the profanity and sexual innuendo(Think naked Supreme Court justices). This is not a book you want to give to a nine-year-old for Christmas. The recipient should be at least eleven. All that aside, it's quite a good read. If you need a good present for a teenager, this is it. (P.S. Those ""other books by the Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" in the back of the book? They don't exist. I checked)."
3,"If you like the Daly show then you'll like the book, but...","If you like the Daly show then you will probably like this book. Although it was entertaining, halfway through it I was asking myself ""where do these celebrities get off thinking they can write?"" Daly should stick to stand-up and leave the serious stuff to real writers like Molly Iverson (she's so funny when she bashes the Republicans.)"
4,The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Presents America (The Audiobook): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction,The moments of hilarity are worth the listen.
1,Voyager story not in audio version,"In the audio version of the story the voyager story is not encluded only TOS,TNG,DS9,Final frontier and chanllenger are.As mentioned by other reviewers these are stand alone stories notconnceted, other than the gateways, to the first 6 in the series.These are worth reading/listening to.The one star rating is because of leaving the ST Voyager chapter out."
1,Excellent book but Kindle Format Problems,"This is a 5 star book and great continuing of the Eagle series. You should not buy this as a Kindle book though. At location 4769 and till the end of the book the font changes in size on the pages from very tiny to large and at times this font size change appears all on the same page mixed.So do yourself a favor and buy the book as a paperback and avoid the Kindle edition. This is the second time I have seen this happen for the books in this series for the Kindle stuff. It is a shame that Amazon does not have a better quality control/review of this stuff and leaves it up to a reader to find. They should actually hire or provide Kindle books for free to a volunteer QA staff to check this stuff out, but that would be too simple."
4,Simon Scarrow Collection,"I have always had an interest in the Roman Empire and the amazing (and unfortunately sometimes savage) way in which it went about it's business. You can feel yourself drawn back in time with Simon Scarrow's characters Cato and Macro, from the battle scenes, which are increasingly described in great detail but without going overboard in the depth, to life within a Roman Legion either on the Campaign trail or on hiatus in any number of locations. A sense of realism woven within the fabric of the intrigue, character development and storylines leaves you with no option but to keep reading until you've finished the book, and then , you're left wanting more.I was hooked from the first book, Under the Eagle, and am currently having a hard time putting down The Eagle in the Sand.Thank you Simon Scarrow."
1,Too much text,"This book is too much text and with 300 pages only has 37 pictures of very poor dot matrix quality. No step by step instructions. Much reading, very little learning."
4,Overall pretty good book,"A well written book that is pretty easy to read with very good pictures and diagrams. While it doesn't go into the same depth as some other medical neuroscience books, it's really more than efficient for general medical education. It's concise enough to be read from cover to cover!"
2,Disappointing,"This book was the recommended text for my med school neuroscience class. I was disappointed to say the least. Many of the topics we covered in lab and class weren't covered in the text. The text was written in large paragraphs without many breaks, there was very little bolding of key terms, the index was not terribly helpful, and there weren't enough figures/pictures. The few times I hazarded another search in text, I came away disappointed. I would not recommend this text."
2,Common sense prevails,"I have always wanted to go back to all the self help books I have read and write a summary about the best items. At least the author admits that he is not expert and is only writing about things that he has read. The first few chapters are at least about what he has read. When you get farther back in the book, he is just talking about what anyone with common sense knows.He might be a good motivational speaker, but leave the writing to the experts."
3,Stiff arm,"This is a stiff arm approach to taking responsibility for your life. Really??Of course we need to take responsibility, but let's not get brow beaten.I think people prefer more positive books like Full Throttle: how to supercharge your energy at work by Drgreggsteinberg.comIt shows how to take responsibility in a positive format"
2,The Fourth Reich Gets Frozen Out,"The Publisher's Weekly blurb above gives a fair description of this book. On the downside, you have the pretty implausible scenario of a Nazi colony on the Antarctic ice. And they're in cahoots with Middle East terrorists, if that makes things any more believable. You have a bunch of US Navy personnel who don't quite act and react the way professional military people do. And the pace does drag a bit.But hey, it's not all that bad. The pace picks up towards the middle, and after you suspend disbelief, the story if pretty interesting. Some of the characters lean towards cartoonish, but others are pretty well drawn. There's a bit of humour to liven things up, and some interesting descriptions of Antarctic life.I wouldn't buy this new, but get it in the library for a lazy afternoon's reading. Morris is no Clancy or Cussler, but he does a decent job here."
2,"Not exactly the ""how to"" book I was looking for...","This book is really nothing more than a collection of generalized knowledge, and some good pictures. I don't need someone to tell me in a book that I need an engine, transmission, etc to build an old school bobber. ""How to"" suggests exactly that - you are going to tell me how things get done, and provide me with some good instructions, tips, tricks, and pictures to go along with it. If you want a book that gets down to the nuts and bolts of the building process, buy something from a different author because this book won't tell you how to build the bobber you want."
3,Strings tribute not for Mozart!,"Having a string quartet interpret some of your favourite band's songs would definitely make an interesting listen. And now that I've had a few spins of it on my player, I think that it was a brave attempt for four talented classical players to produce.I found some songs hard to pick first time listening, and as previously mentioned, the track listings are incorrect. However, the rendition of some tracks on strings definitely bring a new light to songs you'd so easily identify a rugged voice to. ""Busted"" is definitely a favourite with haunting arrangements and accuracy in the melody line.A good one for something a little different, but only for rockers with a little soft edge!"
4,Take A Sad Song And Make It Better,"Best Wilson Pickett album I've ever heard.David Allman's guitar playing ain't bad either.Buy it, you'll like it"
3,Life's just a cocktail party on the street,"Spanning 1974 (It's Only Rock-n-Roll) to 1980 (Emotional Rescue), the ten tracks provide a fleeting glimpse into a period where the band was exploring the rhythms of reggae & disco and the unbridled power of punk.Released in April 1981, the most interesting cuts are the rarities - Everything Is Turning To Gold, the B-side to the single, Shattered; a remix - If I Was A Dancer (Dance Pt. 2) - and a wicked live version of When The Whip Comes Down, fron 1978 in Detroit.While an electic compilation, what was missing then and now is the long version of the titanic dance classic, Miss You, the mix which was originaly issued on vinyl as a 12-inch disco single.The trio of cuts is enough for for those who are seeking rarities through official releases. But the scope is limited and affordable enough - four albums - where most fans can get a complete picture without these bits and pieces."
4,For those who want to try reading Mayakovsky in Russian,"Excerpts from poems, plays, and prose of Vladimir Mayakovsky will give you a taste of this great Russian writer. The book has explanatory endnotes in English and accent marks in its Russian text. It also contains the autobiography."
5,succinate dehydrogenase,the effects of inhibition and cellular localization of succinate dehydrogenase
4,Panasonic 5.8GHZ,"I bought this phone as a gift, but the person I got it for claims it is a wonderful phone and likes it very much."
4,"Simple, talks LOUD","I got this for M-i-L who is 93. It's adjustable volume, reasonably clear sound and good size buttons."
4,Dearly Beloved LOVES This,"One of his favorite ingredients in his spice cabinet. I see him pull it out a lot when he is making his snacks and meals. He likes certain things I am not allowed to have so he makes them himself, especially Italian based meals. Anything with Garlic I can't have so the Amore pastes are a wonderful addition to our kitchen!"
4,V-moda vibe dua earbuds for iphone,I love these headphones and will never go back to the terrible apple headphones provided with the iphone. These never fall out of my ear and sound amazing. They produce excellent bass with no distortion and block out a lot of ambient noise. I love these for my commute home from work. I no longer have to turn the volume up to max to drown out the annoying cell phone conversations of the people sitting next to me. The only downside is the lack of a phone answer/itunes button. But I don't mind taking it out of my pocket to answer a call. I always feel weird talking with the headphones in my ears if I have the phone in my pocket. It makes me look like i'm talking to myself. I highly recommend these.
2,Same problem as Diogenes,"I had exactly the same issue as Diogenes (see review above) - the ""durable"" cord (and it certainly looks and feels extremely durable!) within a month or two gets some sort of weakness near the headphone jack and the sound to one ear becomes unreliable and then stops. Exactly the same problem with a replacement pair. Infuriating, because WHILE THEY WORK they are terrific earphones. Sounds like a serious, consistent problem to me..."
2,Not shito ryu exactly,"Having the most basic techniques, is a useful guide for a beginner. The problem I found is the fact that the techniques displayed in the pictures are not exactly performed in the Shito Ryu way. See this link to compare: [...]The techniques showed in there are a mixture of Shotokan and Shito ryu, so is not a good guide is you are looking for a pure shito ryu book.Not good for active karate practicioner, good for somebody jus looking around"
2,Too simple!,"I don't recommend this book. It's too basic information, just some stances, some punches and blocks and some kicks with some pictures. Save you money. However you may find some usefull information, but just for beginners."
3,Good for the basics,"All the hand and leg techniques are perfectly shown; but I wish moving and turning were included, as well as a kata or two."
5,My own cell phone,"I bought the cell phone for my grandson who lives out of state. My daughter-in-law says my grandson loves it. She likes it also, It keeps him away from theirs."
3,It's ok,"I was a little disappointed in this phone when I received it. Paying $30, I expected the light up display to be more. It's still ok, my 6 month and 5 year old both like it, but it's bigger than I had hoped also. If I saw this phone in a store, there is no way I would have paid [...] for it."
2,Split Book,"Personally, I think Lackey would have done better for her characters and plotlines if she had split them in two. One book for the Harton School plot, and another, quite different plot for Lord Alderscroft. The latter is an often mentioned character in the previous Elemental Masters books, and he certainly deserved a better treatment than he received in the novel--even though the book is named after him, he is one of the most shallow characters there. I hope Mercedes Lackey is not being hounded by her publisher or us, her readers, to produce too much, too quickly."
4,Good read.,This is a good book in the series and takes us back to when Lord Alderscroft was younger. I love the way Mercedes Lackey explores the magical traditions of other cultures and makes it accessible to the rest of us. I was engaged the whole way through.
4,Children with paranormal talents,"The novel deals with school environment of talented children and thuss is of special interest. It's fantasy of an ideal school and good teachers, and it gives good mind and feelings to the reader, who can correlate it to her's ovn reality of the past. A nice story, with good characters, activities and environments. I recomend it to all ages, young and elder people"
5,For those fighting breast cancer,"This book is a treasure of information, arranged so the reader can easily find information as it is needed. Everyone facing breast cancer should have a copy!"
5,Every Mother Should Have This Book,"Because this book is a comprehensive work on breasts, I think it is vital that every mother have a copy of this book, study it, and share its information with her family (male and female). I have been diagnosed with stage three cancer although I have had mammograms and breast exams on schedule. Had I known what was in this book, I would have been alerted to signs that my doctor missed. This book gives the reader the power to have control through knowledge."
5,Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book,"Truly the bible of information for any woman diagnosed with breast cancer. More information than, hopefully, you'll ever need while going through this.Clear explanations aimed at the lay person to help them navigate through the breast cancer experience.This Doctor left no stone unturned and no question unanswered. Easy cross-reference, some website references, statistical figures, drawings, and perfectly clear explanations.This book is a MUST for anyone who has, or knows of someone who has, breast cancer."
4,An important and powerful book,"While I have to agree with some other reviewers who found Reston's account of his daughter's struggle against some pretty awful circumstances to be curiously bloodless at times, it is nevertheless a powerful story, well-told, of a family's fight for their beloved little girl. Reston's struggle against a sometimes incompetent medical world was particularly vivid to me, particularly in how, at every turn, his family was faced with unwavering ""expert"" diagnostic conclusions, many of which were ultimately wrong and occasionally to the extreme detriment of his daughter. This is quite simply a very important book, and one that I'm glad I finally got around to reading.(In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I read this book specifically because I was curious as to how Reston's narrative would compare to my own in my book, published about two years later. As a result, I suspect that came into this book predisposed to like it.)"
5,Clinton Transcriptions CD,"This is the second of two volumes of special transcription recordings which were recorded with a high fidelity process in the 1930s, long before it was to become the standard recording process in the 1950s. The technology for hi-fi was created in the 1930s and was only used for special radio broadcasts (and radio receivers). As a result, when you listen to this CD you are treated to classic 1930's swing performances with terrific sound quality, far superior to the typical acetate recordings of the period. This is Larry Clinton, a ground-breaking, masterful composer/arranger, and his precise, swinging band, with the marvelous Bea Wain singing the vocals. If you love 1930's style swing, I highly recommend both volumes. They are a delight."
4,YOU CAN'T MAKE SOAP WITHOUT LYE,"This is in response to the uninformed reviewer who complained because the soap-making recipes contained LYE. Here's a news flash for you: you can't make soap without lye. Good, old-fashioned soap has three essential ingredients: lye (sodium hydroxide), fat (animal or plant), and water. You can add fragrance, color, and other additives to make it fancier. The water, fat, and lye are transformed into soap by the chemical process of saponification. Once saponification is complete, the finished product no longer contains lye.Learn to make your own soap. You won't regret it. It's easier than you think, it's fun, and MUCH better for your skin.Don't let that dissuade you from trying out this book."
1,Excrement,"I didn't think I would ever come across a concert video worse than Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill: Live."" It's taken more than a decade, but I've found it. Shot in 16:9, but mastered with the old school 4:3 pillar boxes, this DVD is unwatchable.The video image is vhs quality at best, not to mention the audio, which sounds like it was recorded by a bootlegger in the audience.This piece of garbage should be avoided at all cost."
3,Nice Try,"If you like Black films, you make like this. It's entertaining. The cast acting could have been somewhat better."
4,Very useful for a great price,I really enjoy the push-up bars. They give you a larger range of motion and take the strain on the wrist away. The only thing I don't like much is that they diameter of the bars is a bit too small and could hurt the palm sometimes.
3,It was really good toward the end,Ever notice how books as in real life the past usually comes back to haunt you? Thats what happens to Erica and her brother Robert. Something horrible happened to them as children Erica has done well in her life but Robert is a recluse who lives in a shack. There are diffinitely a few twists and turns in this thriller. I really like the fact the my name is in it Athena I have never read a book with my name in it before.
4,A must have for an ecologist,"A nice compilation of papers that historically leads you through Ecology as a scientific discipline. The commentaries are useful and educational. It is timeless and a fundamental instrument for any ecologist, particularly at the early post-graduate level. The only drawback is that it could be more comprehensive (the editors state that they had to define criteria to cut out some papers from their initial selection), but the information in it can be complemented with good Ecology textbooks."
2,"Not the best fit, or finish","The finish is a generic textured surface which doesn't match my 1999 Audi A4. The edges are rough too which shows when installed.Worse yet is that this doesn't fit well in the factory opening, I had to squeeze it which caused it to have a bow in it. Additionally, the retaining clips are too deep (made for a thicker OEM material)which prevents it from holing tight to the dash opening.I've tried two of these, both were the same and disapointing. I'd say they are better than nothing, but no better than that.I used a different brand ""american...something"" in my wifes Audi which worked somewhat better. I suggest you look for another brand than this Metra"
2,Simple Sourdough,"This book might be o.k. for someone who has never made sour dough bread before, but I have been making sour dough bread for a few months now. I expected to gain something new from the book, but didn't. The book is probably worth $3.00, but I would have been very disappointed had I paid anymore than this. The information in the book seems somewhat ""thrown together,"" and vague. Better than nothing if you are going to make sour dough bread for the first time!"
3,"Tiny, tiny little pamphlet",I was shocked when I saw what I paid so much for. The only thing it has going for it is the recipies and darned few of them! Buyer beware!!
4,It was worth the money.,"Very well written,compassionate and informative. A hell of alife.Not all cookies and cream.He had the money but no happinessexcept the strip.The accident and the leg drew a black shroud over the rest of his life."
5,Deceptive title masks one of the best werewolf novels.,"The title and the back cover blurb hides the fact that this is the best werewolf book written in the 80's. A serial killer is stalking southern california. The killer is captured. This is where most standard WW stories end. And this is where The Hyde Effect breaks from the pack. The killer confesses to being a werewolf. He is transported to a government research facility where his ""delusion"" can be studied by the top specialist of the day. But at moonfall, in front of dozens of witnesses...All Hell Breaks Loose. And with the facilities fail safes triggered, the building is sealed with hundreds of victims inside. It's Die Hard with a Werewolf. I won't spoil it by telling you more, but I will say that I have read this book three times. --Cruz--"
1,These speakers stink!,"When I first bought these things I noticed a nasty little buzzing noise, especially when I listned to my MP3's. It gets especially bad if I try and turn the sound up. It's a step up from my laptop's speakers, but not by much. I have a great pair of cambridge soundworks speakers at home and they've lasted me several years. These make me wish I had brought THOSE with me to college."
2,Not really that good,"The speaker you are showing are the Harmon Kardon 19.5They are not the same as the HK195With these speakers, there is a combination bass, treble controlthat if you want more bass you just loose treble, the controldiminishes one or the other.The older HK195 speakers had 3 control knobs that would boostthe bass or the treble and would not diminish the quality ofthe sound. The older speaker were tapered at the top slightlywhich better fit the sides of you monitor.I bought a pair of these and were very dissapointed in the sound quality. get a pair of 20 watt yamaha's with volume , bass, and treble control if you want to enjoy you CD music. not thesespeakers...They are Hk 19.5's anyhow."
2,Don't Expect Too Much,"Not the worst you could do for ... speakers, but listening to mp3s on these speakers is not pleasant, with significant distortion, ringing, and poor bass. It's better than my laptop's speakers, but that's about it."
3,Confused,"I just got my CD in the mail today and I'm actually not sure what to say. I listened to it all the way through and it's so different from the first. I was expecting in your face screaming, and it's more mellow. Also, I didn't understand the lyrics to most of the songs. They are SO random. I'm not disappointed, I liked a few songs, but it's not my favorite."
1,Bad CD,"East West's first cd was nothing short of amazing. But on the newest release you have Mike the lead singer singing off key. Yes this isn't demo ville boys, pro tools is are friends. Almost all the songs sound the same, if they don't sound the same they are just bad songs."
1,Are YOU Kidding me??! Stephen SUCKS!,"I cant believe that i have read the same book as some of these reviewers but it was Stephen who ruined the book for me. HE spends most of the beginning of the relationship belittling and antagonizing the proud Bronwyn and then when he grows tired of the hatred he has done everything to foster, turns apologetic and expects her to fall into his arms just because they're good in the bedroom together puh-leeez! HE is an insufferable, arrogant sexist and Im sorry that the author had to resort to making Bronwyn appear unreasonable in her distrust of him in order to pull the story to his side. VERY sad and the one low point of the whole series."
4,Too much is never enough,"This completes the full Keystone Korner recordings of Bill Evans, his last. These should be heard in conjunction with the Village Vanguard set recorded a few months earlier. It is unfortunate that the two Keystones box sets were not properly sequenced for a full performance. It would be nice if they had, at least, included a proper discography that at least told us what sets we are listening to.Never-the-less is is sublime and bursting with energy. In these last few years with La Barbera and Johnson, he rediscovered the core of his creativity. The Paris concert shows them at their best, unfortunately and not unexpectably, his health did effect the Keystone shows. Evans was a comet heading into the heart of the sun. Down a star for recording quality"
4,Thank you Rhino,"I gave it a lot of thought before actually buying this CD Box (100 $ is a lot of money), but... no regrets! The only reason why I'm giving this a four star rating is I think giving a maximum of five stars will leave me nothing to dream of. I will always be grateful to my brother Mark who actually advised me to purchase B, S & S on my recent travel to the States. Funky, inspirational, charming, ... this box has it all for a 34 year old soul brother from Antwerp, Belgium."
1,I wish they would have disclosed everything...,"Nice M-65 but, it was made in China so the sizing is all wrong and the quality isn't there. If you want an M-65 that will last for more than 2 washes, insist on Tru-Spec or Propper. You'll thank me."
3,Old Magic,"This book was just... okay. To be honest, I wouldn't read it again, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody, and in a year I'll probably forget mostly everything that happens. It just wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped it would be for the first half. The second half was better, but it still wasn't enough to make up for the beginning. Still, it wasn't a bad book, it's just not really for me."
5,Great Book,"This book is a great fiction book. Marianne Curley's writing makes you feel like you are actually in the book. Her characters feel real, she describes them so when you feel like you know them. A must read to all fiction lovers! Excellent Book!!!"
4,good..,"It's made of metal and seems to be strong and durable. The only problem is it doesn't exactly match the other one on my other subwoofer (I lost one and had to replace it with this). All in all it seems fine though, it's stronger than the plastic one on my other sub and looks pretty similar...The only minimal problem I had was that I had to re-drill new holes in my sub to install this one, but not a big deal."
2,Limited value for girls lacrosse,"This book contains very little information regarding girls lacrosse. Moreover, there is precious little material relating to the hand signals used by the referees which is another reason I bought it. I returned the book as it had virtually no informaiton I was seeking. There are much beter sources of information out there."
5,You'll be glad you read it.,"What a great book. Terribly stimulating and funny. It keeps you hooked from page one. I swear I was there riding in the car. Susan M. Brooks can write. She has an easy flowing style, not like many I've read in a long time. She keeps you captivated. 292 pages and I was done in 3 days. Working days! I didn't want to put it down. You want to know what's going to happen next. Parts of the book brought back memories of schoolhood that I had forgotten about. You'll laugh out loud and maybe even cry a little bit. Remember the ""fresh girls""? You will!!I recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Susan M. Brooks."
2,"Sappy, overly sentimental movie that DOESN'T belong in a holiday box set.","Spoiler alert! Not exactly a feel good movie. Parents die (father from diptheria, mother from typhoid) and oldest kid, who's 12, has to find homes for his 5 brothers and sisters on Christmas day. Son is played by a boy who HAD to become a gay man in later years and sister was The Bad Seed a year earlier. After this potboiler, it's no wonder RKO closed up shop later that year (1957) and sold the whole studio to Lucy and Desi. Avoid this stinker!"
4,Don't Let the Shakeout Leave You Out in the Cold!,"The economic shakeout of 2000 has left many corporate refugees to fend for themselves. If you are feeling dazed and confused and not sure what to do next, I recommend you read this book immediately! It has practical tools and insight to get you going in the right direction...your future."
1,Insulting and demeaning,"The term ""mohammedan"" is insulting to Muslims. If the author did not recognise this fact, he must be an old school bigot still fighting the Crusades."
5,TOO TOO COOL,Not only are these the most beautiful speakers ever designed they sound good enough that I retired my venerable Speakerlab's and just listen to my Cube with iTunes as a jukebox. I think they sound great and recommend them.
4,I like 'em,I have lusted over these speakers for a while and finally got them and they sound wonderful and look great...BUT you do give up a bit of function for fashion by loosing the headphone jack (I have a G4 Cube). But I really like them nonetheless. By the way I am a Mac fan not an electronics fan
3,PMRC,"This is a PMRC book condemning popular metal bands since 1969/1970. However, one of the only satanist bands was King Diamond, and he's a born again Christian. These are Christian bands who got their reputations tarnished. It's like Bob Larson. Be warned."
3,"Somewhat monotonous, but decent review of the chronology of metal","I think many readers of this book are happy simply to have metal treated as a topic worth covering. Unfortunately, the book doesn't do a particularly crafty job of synthesizing the events and circumstances that moved metal over 30+ years. Rather it takes on a fairly amateurish chronology more than a historical synthesis. With the heavy handed treatment of Metallica, and a minimum of insight, it is a work that ultimately leaves you wanting more. I'm guessing with the work on the VH1 show, the author may come back to revise this with a more mature and experience pen."
2,A temporary solution,"Not what I expected. One sheet of protective material, which did not stick very well."
2,so-so,"Major plot twist at the end a poor effort to keep up with the pack. The female lawyer is totally extraneous. The prosecution case not even close to ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" Overreliance on the F-word in the narration. Lawyer-narrator begs you to love him. Every character a walking cliche.Plus added for interesting legal points."
1,Dissapointed,"Lights are not made for the Northest. With sporadic sunlight, cloudy winter skies and inconsistant sunlight, performance is very POOR. I have yet to have a full night of actual lighted walkway. Not happy at all with the overall performance."
1,do not recommend,"westinghouse 15-set solar lights stainless steel After owning for six weeks , not one light is working. very dis appointed. We have other plastic solar lights from three years ago that are still working but this set had promblems from the start. We charged them in full sun for three days before placing them across the front of our house and four immediately do not work. The others were nice and bright for one night and they all gradually stopped working 'til now none are working even after replacing batteries. Don't waste your money."
1,westinghousee solar lights,"I have purchased 3 sets thinking these would be great all around my yard. They are not. They do not hold a light. Have tried everything to get them to work, but they won't. Wish I never bought them. Waisted a lot of money."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!,"Mine came in the mail today ( I had ordered new) the package had been repackaged and it was completely demolished and un-operable when it arrived at my house!! I called price pros to straighten this out when i found myself on hold for an incredibly long amount of time till i was prompted to ""leave a message""!!! I would rate 0 stars but it won't let me!!!!!"
1,Simply generic and unoriginal...,"A hefty fraction of the song ""All About You,"" sounds identical to ""All the Small Things"" by Blink 182. The first time I heard the song, I thought I was listening to a parody. The others tracks are not as unoriginal, but just as cliche, and it seems as though he simply attempts to imitates the pop rock music of the current Top 40."
4,I can hardly wait to visit,"Our son has just moved to Houston, and I bought this book in an effort to learn about his new home. I'm glad I did. Maybe the restaurants reviews ARE out of date, but Joanne Harrison writes in a breezy, conversational tone, throws in enough history to give a sense of place, gets in the traditional and off-beat sights to see, and organizes it all well. There are even sections on nearby places to visit such as Galveston. I felt I learned a lot about the CHARACTER of the city. I'll let the son take us to the latest hot restaurants (although I bet House of Pies is still there)!"
2,Ditto Gravity Works,"The fold up feature simply doesn't work. If you don't mind it dragging the ground when the door is used or not, then you will like it."
2,Will Not Stay Folded,"While the sit-up bar secures to the door fairly well, it will not stay folded up. It also moves around while you're trying to do sit-ups. The fact that it won't stay folded resulted in so many stubbed toes that I just removed it from the door - I'm better off improvising with my toes held under the edge of the dresser. If you need a sit-up bar, just buy one that bolts and doesn't fold. I had one of those before and it worked really well."
3,It is OK,A little hard to use but hopefully it will be worth it. Better to use against a wall. Price was a little expensive.
2,Too long for use with bare feet,"This product needs two design changes in my opinion. First, the bar should be shorter so you can use it barefooted. Second, the hinge that the bar swivels down on should be stiffer (or latch) so the arm will remain in the upright position when the unit is stowed. Mine falls down all the time and on one occasion produced an angry wife with a stubbed toe."
2,Not a nice combination,"I dont like the material and print of the doll's clothing, it reminds me too much of how maria from the sound of music made the children clothes from her curtains! ha ha ha. I that barbie should have blonde hair, and not in that ugly bun, and lose the glasses, as with stacies ugly bandanna."
4,Makin' a difference!,"Todd Rundgren has been appealing in his music from ""We gotta get you a woman"" to ""Hello its me"" to ""Real Man""! This disc *is-a-must for the collection !"
5,Really nice compilation,"This Todd Rundgren compilation is very nice and has many great songs. I've always liked Todd Rundgren's style, he was able to do different styles. The sound is very good and the choices for the songs were wisely selected, I believe. That's not to say that the compilation couldn't have been more extensive, but I think they hit all the high points. Highly recommended."
5,An outstanding book on a crucial period of Scottish history,"Anyone who is a Scot or has a Scottish background will be fascinated by this book. Meticulously researched, it describes the harrowing lives of the many Scots folks who emigrated to the US and Canada during the 18th and 19th centuries.We were shocked to learn that some Scottish emigrants had become slave owners, while others with few belongings and no means were left stranded on remote points of the Canadian coastline in the middle of winter."
5,Great Tool for College Students,"I purchased this book for my son, a freshman at a Missouri college. He is an above average student. Due to scheduling problems, he had to dive right in to Calculus without the normal pre-calc course. Calcalus for Dummies helped him keep his head above water. He is pulling an ""A"" right now & believes working though this book helped him put it all together."
3,One glaring weakness,I would give this book 5 stars except for one omission that I find unbelievable: There are no practice problems! Not a single one! Each chapter of the book should have at least a couple problems for the reader to work. This omission mars an otherwise splendid review of the subject.
1,Yech.,"This is what happens when you make caramels and they flop. I paid $17 for a 2pound bag, and couldn't even GIVE them away."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I am about to return this item for the second time. The first time, I returned it because the picture was ""stuck"" in widescreen mode -- no matter what setting I had it set on. This time I am returning it because sporadically (but often) while watching a DVD, the screen will turn completely blue. I bought this DVD after reading many glowing reviews. Maybe I got a lemon twice? I doubt it."
4,Great Performances / bad track order,"These are exuberant performances of Gershwin, recorded in an acoustic that reminds us that these were the pop music of the day. The technical problem below should not dissuade listeners.Unfortunately, the track order is badly confused: Gershwin enthusiasts will recognize Rhapsody in Blue / Three preludes / Sleepless Night / Impromptu / Seven Foxtrots [Sweet, Maybe, Clap, So Am I, Looking, Someone, Feeling] / Second Rhapsody. I have this on an eMusic download, but Amazon's track order is the same wrong one. Don't know if the album itself is disorderd."
3,Manual of Avionics: An Introduction,The title should have been a clue. This is an introduction to civil aviation electronics in the UK. It is a good review of the theory of operation of ground stations with just a little information on aircraft equipment.
5,Very Good Value,"I had never purchased furniture online and after reading some of the reviews I was almost scared off, but I am very happy I went through with it. Is it the best thing ever made, no. But for the price it is a solid piece of furniture. Assembly isn't difficult and it is sturdier than I had thought. Very pleased."
1,Needed a man to assemble it.,I am a single mom. i bought not realizing how complex time consuming it is to put together. had to pay someone else to put it together. so in the end it cost around 80. Not going to buy furniture on site.
3,Bring your drill,"So. This thing looks great, but I pretty much pulled my hair out getting it together. Some design flaws on the drawer where the holes do not line up where they should. I tried to force it, which split the particle board and had to be repaired. Once the repair dried, I drilled new (SHALLOW) holes, and it went together fine. Just a word to the wise if you get confused in putting it together, they used cheap plastic pieces to put the drawers together instead of screw locks. Drove me nutters."
5,finishes the collection,looks great and easy to assemble. I have the entire south shore bedroom collection now. Now i just need to find the right lamps.
5,"A Truly beautiful, well trained voice.","She has a pop/classical style like Sarah Brightman, only this is all pop. Her voice has a beautiful etherial quality. The songs are very romantic. The CD sounds much better than the samples online.Laura, consider me your first sale for your next CD too!"
5,Energizer 2025BP-2 batteries,"They work just fine. What else can I say. 11 more words required, 7 more words required, 3 more words required."
3,Prices too high,"I found the best price (of the looking that I did) for these batteries at Amazon, but I have to say that the price for these things is quite outrageous, costing almost as much for the batteries as it did to pay for the device they were for, a small booklight. I actually went to Staples the other day and bought 5 or 6 booklights that were on sale for about $3 each. It is cheaper to buy the booklights and throw them away than it is to buy new batteries to keep them running."
2,Non retail packaging.. very old batteries...,"the batteries are not as pictured. In fact, they are not even in a retail packaging. They are old batteries also.. manufactured in 2006.. I am not sure what the shelf-life is for this battery.There isn't an expiration date on these."
4,Item is in different packaging & no expiration date printed,"Item arrived fairly quickly.Item is not packaged like the image shown. I will post pics.Item does not have printed expiration date even though website description claims an expiration date, which is concerning."
5,excellent batteries,"These 3 volt lithium button cell batteries by Energizer do a great job in my remote control for a small portable DVD player I use when I'm travelling and want to watch a movie. They fit into the remote without a hitch and they last a good long time, too.I highly recommend these batteries by Energizer for use in remote controls like mine and any other product that requires this type of 3 volt battery. If you use these and you catch a sale on them, stock up!"
2,The displayed picture is misleading,The item shipped to me was the right part number but it does not look like the picture. The batteries I got was individually wrapped. Not happy with how the item was shipped in a regular envelope. In fact it was lost in the mail. The seller did not send a replacement within his promised date. Finally I got the original shipment after a month.
4,batteries 4 car key,didn't come in the packaging as shown in picture but they were the correct batteries. They seem to be working fine but only time will tell if they last as long as they should.
2,"Incompatibility Problems, Setup is VERY difficult!","This VCR says that the remote is ""multi-brand"" compatible...It will not operate a Sony Satellite Receiver, and it will not operate a GE television...go figure! It also claims to have an ""auto-set"" clock...I have programmed NUMEROUS VCR's, and have NEVER had as much trouble trying to program a clock as with this one. I had a JVC VCR before and was very happy, that is why I bought this one. After calling JVC, and being told that they were ""not responsible"" if the codes to operate other equipment did not work, I returned it."
5,Good Eats,"Jyl makes food fun and easy to prepare. No fuss, no muss.Watching calories? Have no fear, Jyl provides calorie count and nutrition breakdown for all her recipies.I highly reccommend this book."
4,Take me to Tolemac!,"This was a great story, I was late for work because I needed to know what was happening with Maggie. I did not care for the blunt ending. Someone please tell me part two is coming. I would also like to know what happend to Derek's childhood friend that vanished, was it Val? Ms. Lawrence keep up the good work your story was great!"
5,Great story!,"This is a wonderful recollection of a young girl's struggles in China. The author does not sugar coat her condition in the slightest, and deeply conveys her misery and sorrow in this compelling memoir. Though many of the issues and situations she deals with are jarring and upsetting to the reader, her story is completely deserving of the reader's attention!"
4,Touching Story,"This book is a sad, touching memour about a girl who has no kindness given to her at all.Her family almost treats her like a slave.Though Wu -mi (Adeline) doesn't do any harm to her brothers and sisters, they have no respect for her at all.For cry'in out loud, half the time her father doesn't even remember her name!!!There are very interesting parts in the book. My favorite parts are sad parts. What impressed me was the way Adeline was abused through out her life,she managed to go college in England with her older brother and became a marvelous writerI recomend this book to anyone who's a lover of somber books."
5,Sad yet True,The story of this womans life is so sad. I cried. Listen to her words as an unwanted daughter. This is a touching book and it will bring tears to your eyes. As cruel as her family treated her. Her struggle to beat her stepmother. It is so sad.
4,A STEPMOTHER WORSE THAN CINDERELLA'S,"This story points out that there are a few human beings that have a ""built in"" sense of accomplishment that is the most overpowering feeling of their being and nothing will get in the way. Here is a young girl where most of her family hate her (she has 2 allies that are eventually expunged)and above all, her stepmother is directly from hell. How she was able to overcome her family's hatefulness is beyond my understsanding, however, when she was at school her classmates and teachers did love her...even have a couple of events where ""Cinderella's"" family berated her classmates.This is a most interesting read and I shall, for sure, next read ""Falling Leaves."""
3,Hmm... puzzling,"I read this book for a school book report--if the story is just the right amount of sadness, I love it, but this was downright depressing--yet somehow intriguing. I understand it's Adeline Yen Mah's story, she can't change it, but I feel like the terrible parts were extreme and the happy parts were somehow not. I admire Ms. Mah for her triumph, but I can't stand to think of everything she had to go through. I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than ten. However everyone's opinions are different, for example, my best friend loves a book I can't stand. Please don't decide whether or not to buy the book from this review--use the description. But in conclusion I have to say, congratulations to Ms. Mah for eventually succeeding."
3,Chinese Cinderella,"Chinese Cinderella is a great story about Adeline and how she was unwanted. When she was born her mom past away a little bit after she gave birth to her, which in this story they thought it was bad luck. The story continues to talk about how she grows up and learns to love and understand her family, but also how successful she can be in her life. This sroty is a short, readable, and very understandable story that anyone can read. I thought that this story was very sad, but also very inspiring the way she was strong enough to shape her own life and to go do that. I recommend this book to anyone who is independent and believes in being able to shape their own life.CR......."
4,Chinese Cinderella,I purchased the book for my daughter (for school). I wanted to find out what my daughter was reading so I read it. I liked her style of writing and she was successful in introducing the Chinese culture without making it look like a history class. I thought she was able to narrate her feelings and you can actually feel her pain. THe title was really perfect for the book!
2,Too depressing,"Read it in school, lots of questions, but it is an easy read. ""The problem then, Mdizzio?"" Well, depression. I dislike reading books that depress you so much to the point of being depressed and miserable. Why write such tragic books if they only make you feel sad. These books do not make me feel happy for my life, they just make me feel sad for a different one.Her family torchers her. Pee drinking, her pet, everything seems to come crashing down at one point or another. Seriously though, everything she loves is put down and it is almost painful reading the next page because you know something terrible will happen.I would not reccomend this book for people who like depressing reads. It is easy though, and many people probably love reading depressing novels or whatever, and the class seemed to like it. I mean I didn't, but they did. We all know though they were just telling the teacher what she wanted to hear."
3,It feels too sad to be true,"Sadly , this is a true story of a Chinese daughter that is unwanted in a new marriage. How she grew up and made something of herself, is a miracle in itself."
2,"I'm not a scientist, but I don't think the insert is nylon","The ""nylon"" part appeared to be some sort of softer material, not what I've seen before. It looked like caulking or some material that isn't firmly formed. It was discolored on some of the sizes (off white color), and some had a brownish darkening to that ""nylon"" stuff.The plating appears to be good quality, only time can tell on that. The ""nylon"" stuff inside may serve its purpose to hold the nut in place, but I'm not thrilled with the quality."
5,Why didn't I do this before?,I've had my first one for 5 years and its still going strong. Order two and you'll always have one handy.
4,Very flexible,"Definitely better for flipping than scraping, but happy with the purchase. The heat has caused it to start to bend a little, but nothing out of the ordinary. I just don't keep it pressed to the pan as long..."
5,Excellent purchase,Does it's job very well and is a great addition to the kitchen for the price. I like the big handle and the flat surface of the turner. It also looks like it will last a good number of years.
3,Can't Stand the Heat,I was surprised how poorly the head of this nylon turner stood up to the heat of my frying pan. The end of the turner is now blackened and somewhat deformed. The design and action of the turner are great but the nylon head does not hold up well to the extreme heat of the frying pan. The surface temperature of the pan can well exceed the 400F limit of the spatula. Be carefull not to foolishly leave it in the frying pan as I did. Should work fine for bakeware however.
2,Not the greatest,"I must say that I was less than impressed with this spactula. I love OXO products and own a lot of them. This one looks good however when warm, it tends to droop for lack of a better word. I have to give bad reviews, but trying to hold up something other than maybe an egg, go with something a bit more heavy duty."
2,It flips well...,"The OXO Nylon Flexible Turner is extremely thin, making it easy to get underneath eggs or anything else you're flipping. BUT, I'm surprised by the quality from OXO. From the first use, I have been peeling off worn Nylon from the tip of the turner and the handle melts EXTREMELY quickly. I'm talking about left on the edge of the pan for a second while I grab another ingredient quickly. I cook on Calphalon and don't cook anything out of the ordinary so I don't see why this should be an issue. My Le Creuset spatulas have no problems melting etc..."
2,Doesn't hold up to heat,"I purchased this because I liked the green color, and we needed a spatula. (Who doesn't need a spatula?)However, even after the first use the edge was a lil' burnt and discolored from regular pan frying. In addition, I cook a lot of indian food, which turned the green plastic into more of a yellow.We later found out that the silicone version of this spatula is the way to go, because silicone can handle up to 600 degrees. Spend the extra $3. Its worth it. This one became junky pretty fast.That being said, it is functional, comfortable, and the green color was a nice touch for the kitchen."
1,Don't like it.,I do not like this flexible turner. It is too flexible and I loose my pancake in the middle of the flip.
3,nylon spatula,it's a little flimsy at the p/u end making heavier things a little bit of a hassle.But it doesn't scratch the no stick pan!
4,Good entry point/introduction,"It just makes me want to get Sex Packets and then continue working my way through their catalog. If I do that, I won't need this ""best of"" anymore. I guess that's how it is with ""best of"" compilations. Digital Underground is one of the great old school hip hop groups of the 90s."
3,Ok for a basic user,"Hi everyone, I got this speakers from the Dell system. I upgrade my Dell speaker to this harmon kardon. The first time I opened the box that 2 sticks looks really cool.Its so easy to install the speakers but the thing is the sound that comes out from these speakers. Don't ever try to turn on too loud because it will blow the 2 sticks. The sub works fine but not the sticks."
2,Good if you can filter out the good from the bad information,"Some of this book I feel like is just the author guessing at what might be true, it seems disorganized because it covers so many species. If you plan on getting a reptile or amphibian, get a more specific book that is correct 100% of the time, and if you are unsure of the type you want then get a hold of some Reptiles Magazine copies or something that can help you chose. I would not recommend this book for beginners or more experienced keepers."
2,SMALL???,"Don't get me wrong. This is a beautiful book. But it's completely unrealistic and not at all applicable to the real world. SMALL apartments don't have recessed lighting and kitchen islands you could park a car on. SMALL apartments don't have double ovens and full laundry facilities. SMALL apartments are often rentals, and not many landlords I know of would put up with my rewiring, repainting, and wall-mounting a heavy flatscreen TV. The idea is a good one, but the execution is flawed. What I'd like to see is a book that defines a small apartment the same way I do: under 750 square feet, with budget restrictions to match."
3,Volume 1 of Dancers at the End of Time,"This series is not for everyone. In this first book, Jherek Carnelian comes back from the end of time to Victorian England to court Mrs. Amelia Underwood.Unfortunately things have changed so much by the end of time that he does not understand courtship, marriage, the use of the toilet (a small adjustment would take care of that issue, but Amelia refuses to be tampered with). Carnelian skips back and forth through time and space doing strange and childish things in pursuit of love while almost everyone else rejects his reality in pursuit of their own. If you can follow his strange point of view the story grows from entertainment to a hint of something profound."
4,A great book but...,"A twisted and trippy tale. Sickening and exciting, Compelling and repulsive. Once again Welshe delves deep inside a fascinating mind and captures a character perfectly. Like many other Welshe titles, it suffers from his habit of wandering off the subject into needless stomach-turning fetish and erotica.____Welshes_______Free__________verse______________style__________________is_____________________a_______________________joy__________________________to____________________________read.This is not his best yet but it's a barry read."
2,Not What It Seems,"This book attempts to explain the dry, boring field of economics in an engaging and painless manner. It fails at doing that. The text itself is often times confusing and dry, coupled with graphs that are basically incomprehensible to anyone without an economics degree. I was more confused after reading than the book than before it. To anyone interested in reading about economics actually displayed in an interesting, fun way, I would highly recommend Naked Economics by Charles Wheelan. It is a tremendously informative and funny book, and actually fun to read."
1,Hidden Agenda,"I was really excited to read this book. I particularly liked the idea of applying economic theory to everyday problems. However, someplace into chapter three I began to realize that there were major flaws with many of the examples, not to mention the poor, often quite opaque writing style. As I continued, a pattern emerged of sloppy logic that always resulted in unsubstantiated libertarian conclusions about gun control, taxes, public policing, marriage, etc. In fact, the writing is so outrageous that I quite enjoyed finishing the book as an exercise in political satire. This book is perfect for every militia-man's bunker book shelf, or for anyone who is just curious how ill-conceived and ridiculous the right-wing economic dogma really is. This is one of the worst books I have ever read."
5,Wonderful,"Wow, who thought that saving money could be so much fun? I'm seriously considering buying a bunch of copies and giving them as Christmas gifts this year."
3,"A good book if you're looking for tips on living frugal,",but not the best. Some of the ideas in here is going towards the extreme like dumpster diving. Some of the ideas the author has is great like having a grocery price book or going to yard sales.
4,Good book!,"I like this book, it has given me many useful ideas. I would get it from the library first before buying it, as the book is disorganized and some of her ideas are whacky in my opinion. The best way to read it is from cover-to-cover as there is no good index in it if you are searching for one thing. I would say I have implemented about 1/3 of her ideas."
2,RE: Tightwad,"The company that sent the book did a great job of shipping quickly, however the book is somewhat of a disapointment. Haven't been frugal most of our lives we actually found only a couple of things that we hadn't done already or tried. This may be good material for some young person trying to learn how to make a dollar go further, but not if you are already a practicing tightwad."
2,So Much More Could Have Been Done,I love Steve-O. Clean and sober as well as drunk and hazed. This flick is soo over the top with nothing fantastic. Trashing a hotel room and lots and lots of backstage footage of live stage shows that show nothing that we would expect from Steve-O. Pass this one up. Apparently even Steve-O couldn't show up for this one.
5,Christian B. one of the best progressive DJs around,"This CD is a must have for any true progressive fan. Christian B. is one of the best progressive DJs around. Club Series 4 is also a must have. Thankfully, Christian B. is back on the airwaves DJing for KIIS-FM 102.7 in LA."
1,It was pretty when the jewel was still in it.,"I reveived this belly ring as a gift and after one day the bottom jewel fell out. Because it was so inexpensive I am not going to send it back, but I am not going to buy another one. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Outdated Merchandise-new formula!,"First of all I ordered this product at the end of January. I ordered 2cases (24 bags). Unfortunately all were stamped sell before Feb. 7th! I can not eat 24 bags in 2 weeks and obviouly had no desire to.Secondly, the formula for the product was changed. It does not taste as good now. Perhaps I should have been informed of this before shipment?"
2,Not For Older Homes!,"This device simply will not mount on a door with wider moldings, typically found in older homes. It simply will not fit high enough to clear the molding. A waste of my money."
2,"It has potential, but...","Mine doesn't seem to fit together quite right. Other people have mentioned using different screws and nuts than what it comes with, but they should really send it with the right parts. I also found the instructions to be somewhat vague. I think with a slight redesign, this could be an excellent product."
1,False advertising: Multi Function is a lie,"Just got this item. did a pull up or 2 to see if it holds me...so far so good. I don't need a tool to do push ups. Now to test the 2nd reason I bought this thing: sit ups. I wanted something that holds my feet down while I do sit ups (as advertised in the picture with the dorky haired dude right?) This is the point you realize you've been had. If anyone knows how to make this work (the sit -up part), I'm golden with this product, if not, lying to a customer PISSES ME OFF!(Please comment if you know how to make this bar hold your feet down whilst doing sit ups"
4,"Functional, but there might be better","Very easy assembly, it took ten minutes. That included getting my socket set. It did & will scratch the paint above the door. Another problems is that it almost did not fit in my door way. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LESS THAN A 36"" DOOR. It did dent my door frame as well. I had no problems as far as stability during the pull-ups. It seems stong enough for a while. I hung this in a doorway in my chiropractic office and it will get overused, so I hope it holds up for a while."
2,Not for me,"I bought this product thinking it would be able to cling to the door frame and be pretty sturdy. The place I currently reside at at very thick doorframes and I don't have much use for it. So unless I find a better place to use it, it sits in my closet. Sorry, but I wish I didn't buy it."
4,chin up bar,"Easy to install. Assembly could be easier, but only took about 5 minutes. Elbows sometimes hit doorway frame when doing certain chinups, but what do you expect? Mine is leaving a slight embedment above the frame where most of the weight is trasnferred, but I keep it on the closet frame so no one sees it. I would definitely recommend this product because it's a quick way to do a few reps to build your shoulders. I have never used it for anything else other than chin ups."
4,"Nice,sturdy product!","Good quality and sturdy. Directions a bit vague, but not too hard to figure out."
4,IM RIPPED NOW,OMG IM SO HAPPY W/ PURCHASE HELPS ME GET JACKED/RIPPED IN THE DOORWAY! AND IT WAS CHEAP
4,Great Bar,"It's a pretty good bar. It doesn't fit on 6 inch wall studs rather than the standard 4, unless you have low molding and trim on your walls. I had a little difficulty putting it together, and the loops can slide out if used incorrectly or for a long period of time. Other than that, it's pretty sturdy, and it delivers what it claims - an upper body workout."
1,avoid,"don't even bother with this product. it WILL NOT stay in place and if it does, it won't for very long.it moves around too much, even during the measley 5 reps I could get out of it before it slipped from its position.the wood part has some paltry sandpaper on it that's SUPPOSED to grip and hold it in place. even if that worked it wouldn't matter, the poor glue (or lack thereof) won't even keep the sandpaper on the wood anyway.and if there's a question of me being extremely hefty or anything, i weigh 185 lbs.save your money, find something else"
4,They're locking nuts...,"There is no problem with the screws. Another reviewer said, ""Yes, like all of the numerous dissatisfied customers who had problems with this product, the screws and nuts are not compatible. I had to force fit the screws.""The nuts are locking nuts. They have a white plastic lining to make them INTENTIONALLY difficult to put on so that they don't come off easily. You have to use two wrenches to get the nuts on. The bolts and nuts are not defective!This product is a great value for the money. I do think it will leave a mark above the door, but I may follow another reviewer's suggestion and put duck tape on the abrasive part. Other than that, the workouts are great."
4,southpole review,"[ [ASIN:B000NW42UO Southpole Men's Core Denim 5 Pocket Short]]received my southpole jeans and was quite pleased with my purchase as well as delivery time,"
1,Good cure for insomnia,"I looked forward to this book and was disappointed. As someone stated in another review, it's the same fantasies over and over again. Many of them are written using the same slang and terminology to reference certain parts of the anatomy. Considering the English language has a dozen words or different ways to describe the female anatomy it seemed more than a bit odd that most of the women who submitted fantasies would all choose to use the same 2 or 3 words. About 1/4 of the way into the book it started to seem like the author wrote a lot of the fantasies herself since she also uses the same slang lingo in her chapter intros and the fantasies are all so similar. The book also lacks variety but if you're interested in reading the mostly tame fantasies of totally inexperienced or totally repressed women, this might be a good read."
1,First Impressions needs a proofreader and editor.,"I got the impression that Rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor. It was superficial, with such helpful hints as ""People come in all sizes and shapes,"" and ""People with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly."" I didn't need to read her book to figure those out. Her logic is also flawed. She states that, ""Doctors touch patients, not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients."" Did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status? Using the book to promote her feminist beliefs, numerous typographical errors, and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer."
2,Mine came quite dull,"Sorry to ruin the party, but I was unimpressed. The knife I received was not very sharp at all. Henckels International knives sold in Target are much sharper. So are much cheaper stamped Victorinox knives offered here on Amazon (Victorinox 47513 6-Inch Flex Boning Knife with Fibrox Handle).Also, it is not really hefty or well balanced. Definitely not worth the $50 tag. Considering this price, can't give more than 2 stars."
2,Doesn't keep everything as organized as it could,"This was not a very expensive cabinet so but it could have been made much better.The main issue is that there are open spaces in the back where the things from the drawers can fall out. I use it to keep my daughter's craft supplies organized so we have foam stickeers in one drawer, little beads, etc. So because of the open spaces, things can fall out through the back and end up stuck at the bottom of the cabinet or in another drawer...not sure why they didn't make the back solid."
5,Awesome bowling ornament!,"My son is a great bowler, and I am always looking for bowling ornaments every Christmas. I can never find them in stores or even at craft fairs. I was delighted to find them on Amazon.com. I bought 3 different ones. My son loved them. They were even personalized! I will buy from this site again. He has a tree with only bowling ornaments on it!! 5 Stars! Excellent rating!"
4,Great Album!,I have heard her sing at the last Montreal Jazz Fest and found that she had a great warm voice and lots of talent. This album showcases her great abilities. A good selection of songs to set the perfect evening mood. I now see why she has been compared to Diana Krall.
1,Price too high for online sales,"I found the 'medical' grade Duracell batteries for $1.69 for a two pack from an online pharmacy (hocks pharmacy). These are way over priced compared to that. The batteries were the ones advertised, just not inexpensive."
3,priced well but shipped poorly,the envelope this was shipped in looked a bit beat up and did not make a good presentation. but the batteries seem fine. So I can live with it. inexpensive
1,Not what is pictured or described,"I specifically bought these batteries because they were pictured as a standard retail pack of two. What was shipped were two batteries that were torn off of the strip of 5 that is sold elsewhere on Amazon (and there you get 5 batteries for a dollar and change). So I overpaid for these by about double the price, given what I received.However, the batteries seem to have a decent amount of charge, at l;east compared to the one that was formerly in the device. (There was no expiration date on the package so I have no real idea how old these are or how long they will last, but for now it is so far so good.)I would not buy these again online given the number of similar reviews to this one - buy this type of battery locally in a drug store or other shop where you can see the expiration date BEFORE you buy.I am giving this 1 star for the deceptive marketing and overcharging for less than half of the 5-pack strip this was torn off of."
2,Minimal juice,You don't get what is pictured and the batteries I received were dated 2011. Luckily they were only $1.86 and for use in a bathroom scale so had sufficient juice for now. I have a battery tester so I can confirm these were half depleted straight out of the package.
5,Greate Price Great Service,"These are best 1.5V batteries I have ever seen in my life! Seriously, what more is there to say. The price is great, they shipped it out immediately, and they work."
4,Nothing more to say here.. just batteries but nice and lasting brand!,"I bought them for my car keyless remote since they went dead. So far I have no complaints. Last time I saved some money ordering a cheaper X brand, but that did not last. I would spend money buying a brand like this because they DO last!"
5,I bought them for a garage door opener,I put these in my garage door opener and they work fine. What else is there to say? Maybe that they only cost about half what the same batteries cost in local big box store. They are lasting just as long as store bought batteries of the same brand.
2,i wouldnt buy this online,"I bought the batteries for my garage door opener, which now works fine so no problem with the product itself. The main gripe is the shipping. The default shipping is SLOW, with no tracking information, and in a ""white envelope"". When it didn't show up (about a week+ of waiting), I contacted them. They said they would send me another shipment, and if I wanted tracking on your shipment, I need to pay for express shipping. Which would have doubled the cost of the item. You cant fault the seller, this is just too cheap an item I guess. My main advice is: Just buy them at a brick and mortar store. Save the headache."
5,Was skeptical,For the price I wasn't sure exactly what I was gonna get. Low and behold they were genuine quality Energizer batteries. Thanks!
3,Disappointed,"I read all of the information about this battery to see if it was what I needed for my watch. When I received them, they were not the right batteries."
3,batteries,there batteries for the book light. whats so wonderful about this. the price for it. i would buy it aganin
4,Glad to have found this on Amazon,I am glad that I found this on Amazon. I had needed two of this size battery for a digital appliance. I had seen the single battery in a package for more than I paid for the pair here. Worked perfectly in the appliance.
3,Did the job,"These batteries worked well, fit properly, and we had no issued. They were reasonable priced and arrived quickly. Overall, no complaints."
1,Whoa! $60 a pound!,"Watch out, the product description is faulty! Even though the description indicates you'll receive a case of 12 bars of this soap, you only get one! That means you are paying over $60 a pound for SOAP! That's too expensive for me."
1,Scent not as advertised,"This soap did not even remotely smell like sandalwood. I knew as soon as I opened the package that the fragrance was not right. I gamely tried it and discovered that it was also very drying to my skin, and the floral scent was overwhelming. I'm not sure why other reviewers with sensitive skin or sense of smell found this product usable."
1,Nothing Special,"One of the purse patterns is nice (Flapper Wrist Bag), but there are cheaper craft leaflets out with better patterns (acrylic chenille seems to be the yarn of choice right now), and if you collect vintage knitting books/patterns you may already have a lot of this stuff. The author's product line is not cheap either, and many of the projects (especially the hobo bags) look like a lot of the cheap imports available today--why put all that money into something when you could buy a nearly identical item cheaper?The clothing is nothing remarkable either, and definitely warm weather only. If you like to slice up strips of fabric with a Rotary Cutter and crochet/knit, you might be able to adapt the patterns for a ""country"" look."
1,Save Your Money,"This book has items in it that most people would probably not wear. I know I wouldn't. I received this as a gift and I while the thought was a good one, it isn't a book I'd have purchased."
5,One of my favorites,"I read this book around third grade. Loved it immensely. At the time, I was a Chinese girl in a mixed though predominately Jewish neighborhood. I was accepted there and there was little mention of race. I saw nothing wrong with a Jewish boy falling in love with a black girl. Years later, when I moved out of the nice little neighborhood I was in, I realized that this was not the norm. Dave at Night certainly puts a lot on the table for discussion. I think it's suitable for all ages and highly recommend this book."
5,Excellent!,"When Dave's father dies, he is sent to the cold, gritty orphanage 'The Harlem Home For Boys' (the HBB). Levine tells her tale with warmth and humor, and creates a memorable and well developed cast of characters. Dave is an engaging hero who will linger in the memory of the reader."
1,Dickens Re Worked,"Gail Carson Levine has written, as the Booklist reviewer notes, a Dickensian orphan story. The only problem with this is that she sets it in a real orphanage, ostensibly telling her father's story, and, in an afterward, listing Hyman Bogen's ""The Luckiest Orphans"" as part of her research.But if she read Bogen's book, she knows the orphanage was well endowed, the children well cared for, not locked in, not beaten, and not subject to prison type mealtimes. They were called ""The Luckiest"" because they were treated to excursions few children at that time could enjoy.The sad part, which might have made a worthwhile children's novel, was that they were without their families. I find it interesting that Levine waited for her father's death before writing the book. I don't think he would have approved. It is a cheap use of a traditional tear jerking theme."
4,Nice pace ... good characters,"This one needs to be in your carousel. Good story line, good character development. Worth the time to sit down and be entertained."
4,exciting,Good story line! It kept me engrossed until The End. If you like surprise endings you will love reading this book.
5,Great book,"Excellent reading. It was hard to put the book down. I anxiously awaiting the next novel, I know it will be great."
1,I do not recommend this book!,I did not like the very beginning of this book. I found it to be very strange and I therefore do not recommend this book at all.
1,From a former employee,"Working for Sidney for almost four years was an enlightening experience. I can honestly say that the way he portrays himself and his company bears literally no resemblance to how either exists in reality. I found Sidney to be a megalomaniac and quite divorced from the day-to-day goings on in Harman International. The company culture is abusive, and back-stabbing is not only the norm but is rewarded. I found senior management there to be ""ethically malleable,"" to say the least, and financial results were reported that were less than honest. You'd never get this from reading this book. So.... if you're looking for good fiction this might be your ticket. If you want an accurate representation of how HI exists, this ain't it. I noticed that it is for sale in the ""Used"" section for under a dollar ... it's still overpriced."
1,Highly Disappointing,"This book is full of bravado and it reads like a one written by a megalomaniac. In the book, it sounds as if Sidney is attempting to address his own regrets in life. I don't mean to discount Sidney's success in business, but he does not share much of that insight in his book. He emphasizes a lot on ethics and integrity, but he doesn't seem to fully embrace that at work or demonstrate that in his family and personal life. He also emphasizes hard work, but who doesn't already know that. To put this book at the level of a classic is highly unfortunate, and to categorize it in the same league as ""My Years With General Motors,"" as Tom Peters has done, is to do Alfred P. Sloan gross injustice."
4,An excellent introductory book for gun novice,"This is an excellent book for the beginner, and also fit for intermediate gunners.The book starts with basic types of firearms and the firearm safety. Then the auther spends four or five chapters for each of the major types of the firearms: rifles, handguns, and shotguns. Each follow the same clear and easy to understand patterns: introduction, ammunition, sights, shooting, and shooting activities. The last chapters dealt with blackpowder guns, airguns, gun care, and even some materials regarding reloading and collection.Anyone who read this book will not become the so-called ""guru"" overnight. However, he or she will possess a much broader understanding of firearms and shootings."
5,Great!,This product was exactly what i expected it to be. I was a christmas gift and she loved as well!
2,Not Useful,"I purchased the book to help with some web parts development. The part on deploying web parts is just patently incorrect. Even following the author's instructions step by step, I still had problem deploying my web part. The worst part of it is that the book's content simply doesn't match up with what happens in Sharepoint. Perhaps the books was written with an earlier, different version of Sharepoint but it doesn't match up with Microsoft Windows Sharepoint Services 2003. In fact, compared to other sources, the instructions given appear to be missing a step or two."
2,Photobook on Indians of the Americas,"A photo travelogue recounting the history, art, and culture of the Aztecs, Toltecs, Mayas, Incas, and many more peoples throughout North, Central and South America. Book explains what kind of world the Americas were when the first migrants arrived, & follow their progress f/savage hunters to lofty aristocrats. Most photos are black and white."
2,Nothing special,"Although nothing on this album forced me to cringe; there was nothing compelling me to hit repeat either. Kind of an indie-pop, alternative rock sound without reaching the nadir of either. I like a few of the songs; Too Late, 100% Free, and Caged, but the balance of the cd kind of melts together without distinction. Potential; perhaps; realized; not yet."
4,Best book clip holder I've tried,"I love these things - they're the only book holders I've found that reliably hold open both paperbacks and large books, and they don't take up a ton of space. I've tried similar products by other companies, but they tend to be flimsier. I agree with the other reviewers that the coated ones are better than the uncoated metal ones (which leave smears on the page). It does take a bit of trial and error to determine how many pages to trap in the clip - if you have too many, it's hard to move it up and down to release the next page. Once you get that figured out, it's easy to use."
3,CAN'T TELL UNTIL YOU NEED IT,"The plan and associated hardware were purchased as a gift. It's difficult to rate a service plan unless you use it, in which case, the product has obviously failed. Simply put, like life insurance, I hope that the service plan is never needed but felt that the added cost was worth the peace of mind it provided for the hardware."
1,Go with Best Buy for product and warranty!,I paid a little more for the Garmin Nuvi 330 at Best Buy but the service contract was the same cost as Amazon. You won't have to deal with the hassle of getting an item repaired or replaced through a third party vendor who doesn't honor warranty commitments. Best Buy will stand behind their warranty. It is much better to be able to walk into a local store for service when it comes to electronics you need a warranty on.
4,Rousing adventure,"Based upon an 19th century novel, ""The Old Fairy Tale: When the Sun was God"" is unfortunately clumsily titled. It's loosely the historical tale of Popiel, a cruel local ruler, and Ziemowit, a hero who 'saves the day.' Against the backdrop of Pagan Poland, with Viking mercenaries and damsels in distress, it's a good tale with very nice production qualities. Anyone who enjoys a film with sword-swinging action will like this film, even if the hero reminds him too much of Drew Carey's friend Oswald (Diedrich Bader)."
5,an ideal book about St. Clare,"I purchased this book after already having read it twice. I first came across it in the library of a retreat house. I have a deep, longstanding devotion to St. Clare of Assisi, and the author of this book, a Franciscan priest, had a deep famliarity with all the original sources about her life. He presents a thoughtful and clear description of every important aspect of her life of devotion to Jesus Christ, as lived among the Sisters of her community at San Damiano. What emerges is a picture of a marvelous, well-balanced, and deeply charitable life -- a beautiful illustration of what authentic religious life can be. I haven't read a great many books about St. Clare, but this one is so very satisfying that I don't need another. This edition is a translation from the second French edition of the original book."
2,"Performance Fine, recording poor","The music is good. The recording is listenable, but it is not as much fun to listen to because the sound is kind of distant. Often time, the noise of what is going on in the room is almost as loud as the music. It does not have much dimensionality. It is mono without much of a sense of presence. I have lots of live Monk that was professionally recorded. These recordings may very a bit in the quality of the recording, but they all sound better than this set.This set is not bad (despite the paragraph above), but is is more for completests. One thing that is interesting is that you hear the voice of ""The Jazz Baroness"" on the live recording introducing Thelonious Monk. It is kind of interesting."
5,Works with Sony RCD-W500C !,"Finally ! after trying several other CD-RWs which also claimed to be ""for audio"" but were rejected, my picky Sony recorder likes these ! Yay !"
5,A UNCONVENTIONAL LOVE STORY THAT WORKS,"I walked into the theatre a little apprehensive, but this movie really works. It's how perfection doesn't count from the outside when love is the purest subject from the inside. I have never been close to relating their hardships, but feel that humanity is quite possibly the only thing that brings us solice in life. These bright directors, actors, writers..you name it, have found me calling this my top choice this year for best indie-picture. This year also goes to American Beauty and Being John M. I haven't yet seen Sleepy Hollow, but most non-Batman movies from Burton are always quite interesting."
1,Major dissapointment,It takes an eternity to get the job done (and I have short hair!). Blades came apart after trying to clean them. Gave it a second chance thinking that the first one was defective. To make a long story short.....I am returning this one too! Please don't bother
1,Incomplete Package,"That is terrible. They noted on the item title that it is with CD Rom but there is not any CD Rom in the package. My item name is ""Longman Preparation Course for the TOEFL(R) Test: Next generation(iBT) with CD-ROM and answer key""."
3,"The Book is good, but I need Audio CD","Again as Title, the book is really good, but we could not get Audio CD for this book.Until I got the book , I found I need Audio CD too, this information should be told first before I make decision.I try to contact with Longman hope to get Audio CD from them, but I am in Canada, they don't ship outside US.Then I try to contact with Longman's training certer in Canada Local Office, they said they don't sell to individual.... Let me find it in book store, I don't like their services at all !!!But I have to use this book, it's good after all."
3,how to get the Audio CDs ?,i am not able to pratice martirals that inside this book. it doesn't provide audio CD's and no place sell this item.Is anyone know where can i get it.
1,Not Happy,"I don't know how this could be, with this supposed to be a new factory cartridge, but after only 6 8x10 pictures, my low ink level indicator came on showing me almost empty. I have never had this happen with other cartridges over the last two years and I do use a lot of cartridges. I ordered the 24A as it is refillable and I wanted to utilize that feature, but was really disappointed to run out of ink so soon."
5,Excellent Cartridge,The 24A is far superior to the 24 Lexmark ink cartridge. It not only has a lot more ink in it. You can use it until there is no more ink in it. Not like the 24 that quits while it still has ink left. The 24A is advertised as refillable as well. I have not tried this yet because it has not run out of ink.
2,Not heat resistant,"While this was great to not scratch my non-stick pans, it melted while using it in an aluminum pan! Would not recommend."
5,a tremendous concert,"If you're a Linda Eder fan, you must have this dvd. It is an incredible concert, and every part of it is first rate, from the band to the choir to the arrangements, and especially Linda herself."
5,A Christmas Gift You Won't Return!!,"You may have never heard the name Linda Eder, but once you watch and hear this spell binding singer on her first ever DVD, you will never forget her! Linda is one of the most amazing talents out there today and this Christmas DVD only comes second to seeing her perform these songs live. If you are one of those who have been fortunate enough to see this concert in person, you can now bring back those memories right into your own home. If you have never had the chance, this DVD will have you hoping that Linda will be coming to your hometown very soon. Let this be the Christmas gift you buy for yourself! You won't be returning it. If you haven't bought the Christmas CD of the same name, make sure you do. You will find that this is one CD and DVD you won't only be pulling out during the holidays. You don't even have to wrap it....it is already wrapped in a gorgeous picture of Linda and what's inside is even better. Enjoy!!"
4,A Good Dose of EWF,"This CD definitely merits a careful listening. A lot of the songs are of the slower variety. But I was particularly impressed by the upbeat track ""Revolution"", in which tribute is briefly paid to such wronged individuals as Mumia Abu-Jamal and Geronimo Pratt. The CD as a whole is very well done, but I wouldn't call it vintage EWF. Their earlier 1993 release ""Millennium"" is a better place to find a more funky, less R&B, sound."
3,Good book - if you have a lot of time,"I really enjoyed this book. It moved a little slow until about half way through it, but it was worth the wait to read. There were so many questions that I had, then it really started to take off once they got to the ""Valley"". The ending was a little strange though. It didn't totally answer all my questions about the ""demons"" and how they got to the valley in the first place. This is most definately not a quick read. Like I said it is slow almost dragging in the beginning, but it makes up for it at the end by explaining most of the history about why these two people got kicked out. It doesn't however describe why these two are being let back in. If you sit down to read this book, have lots of time or plan on putting it down."
5,Huge collection of lovely renditions of standard hymns and Gospel songs,"I particularly enjoy familiar hymns and Gospel songs--songs that were popular fifty years ago when I was young--and songs that have retained their popularity through the years.This is a huge compilation of such songs--at a very reasonable price. A GREAT BARGAIN!!!If the music were not lovely, it wouldn't be a bargain. BUT THIS MUSIC IS LOVELY!!! Mostly piano with a modest amount of background instrumentation or vocal support. Not many Christian pianists could accomplish so much with so little help--but Steven Anderson is no ordinary pianist. He has given each song character and charm.The music on these disks is understated. If you are looking for bombast, go elsewhere. But if you are looking for a graceful approach to ""classic"" hymns and Gospel songs, you will enjoy Steven Anderson's renditions."
4,Son enjoys it,Seems to be a good book. My son has improved his vehicle drawing already. He says he likes it so I guess it's a hit.
5,Universal,"Like everybody else I have experienced anxiety or embarrassment in some social situation at one time or another. But I don't have a serious problem with it. I bought this book because it intrigued me and I was curious. Well, I never expected to identify with it but I did! It explained so much I could relate to and provided such indepth, comprehensive, useful info about universal social experiences. It applies to everyone as they try to overcome their fears to achieve their goals and get satisfaction in their lives. This has the makings of a bestseller."
5,It's time for Diagonally-Parked in a Parallel Universe,"Social phobia is a kind phrase for a highly invisible, debilitating disorder. Its intensity is alarming and confusing to those who are caregivers and exrememly painful for those who suffer, mostly in silence. IT'S TIME FOR DIAGONALLY-PARKED IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE. This book is dynamically informative and compassionately written by someone who has endured SA/SP's grip and ultimately moved past this affliction. Dr. Dayhoff is dedicated to guiding and supporting others in their journey to recovery."
5,Empowerment,Before this book empowerment was something other people had. I felt powerless and defenseless. Nothing I did seemed to work for me. I thought I had no effect on my life at all. I believed no matter what I did I never would. Amazingly this book has changed my way of thinking. I believe good things are possible for me. I am gaining control of my SP and my life. I see I do have a hand in creating my own destiny. I know better now what I want that destiny to be.
5,Real helpful,Seems like everyplace I went I saw this book or heard about it or read about it. I figured it was an omen telling me it was time to do something about my social phobia. The book said it wasn't going to make me a party animal if I already wasn't one under the social phobia. Who cares. All I wanted to do was feel better and meet people and have some fun. Well I am. Little by little. Its great. The books great.
4,prefer second edition,"Publishing companies tinker with great texts to incorporate the sugestions of reviewers and focus groups. Azar's second edition was, as the title indicates, truly basic. The supplementary material supplied by the co-author of the third edition encumbers Azar's five-star instructional design."
3,lydon,"Johnny Rotten himself on his current radio/online show on Eyada said that when he read this, he felt as if the book itself had swallowed a dictionary; that he had to look up about 50,000 words when reading it. And Rotten is a voracious reader, with a big vocabulary, so that's saying something."
1,Should be titled: A Dark Review of The Century,This book has interesting photos but the overall message is extremely negative. Why would anyone want children to read a book that focuses only on the worst events of the times? My wife bought this for our kids and being a history buff I quickly snatched it up for review. Thank goodness! It portrays the worst of humanity and is not appropriate for kids. Even if you only look at the pictures you still get the idea that there is no hope for the future and how horrible people must have been in the past!
3,Not appropriate for age level specified!,"Although my review of this book involved browsing through it rather quickly, I found some of the subject matter to be inappropriate for the age level specified (9-12). It speaks of the Holocaust (which is to be expected) and troubles in the Ukraine under Stalin (where there is specific mention of cannibalism/fishing a woman's head out of a lake). I am returning all three copies as I feel the content is too graphic for the three nine year olds I purchased this for."
2,Be Wary of size...,"This Net is often brought up with tennis searches and IS NOT a tennis net, it's for Badmitton. Foolish me thinking I found an affordable product and did not measure the court down the street first..."
5,"GREAT tv, GREAT price!!!","I've owned this set now for a little over a year, and have had nothing but awesome results. The strangest thing- I never have to dust the screen. For some reason, the dust just doesn't stick!!!"
1,Not Worth It !!,"I purchased the Bravia 46 in 2007. It only took 6 months before it started having a problem. Now it takes 5 hours to warm up, stays on for 5 hours and then goes back to Red and Black vertical lines. If you don't have a warranty, it will cost you at least a thousand dollars to have the screen replaced, because that's what it takes to repair it. If your lucky, you may get Sony to pay the cost, but not the labor, Again IF your lucky.If you value your money look into another set."
3,Half Good & Half Bad,"I have used PE2 since first issued and have been quite satisfied with it overall. I also obtained the separate Photoshop Album and found it of some limited value.PE3 has proved a split decision case. It is slow, has lousy Help service,and - as of now - not all of the features work as intended.Bottom Line: buy it for some of the superior features in its Editor and forget all about bothering with its intrusively clumsy and badly limiting Photo Browser.Instead, for the best, most flexible and easiest to use separate image orgainizing program generally available today, get the new version 5 of Jasc's Paint Shop Photo Album. It works in great harmony with PE3's Editor as well as with Jasc's own editing program, Paint Shop Pro 9."
4,"Great for beginners, lacking a good manual","I have had this product only a week now and I have nothing bad to say about it. Photoshop Elements 3 is not the Cadillac of the line and I didn't expect it to be a 600.00 product. I do say one thing, that this is far better than Microsoft Picture It of any number. Yes there are things that are lacking in this program, but it does more than the previous software I have used. Johne"
2,Not Worth the Money,"I have enjoyed Elements 2 so much, that I quickly purchased the new version. Big mistake. It's got lots of stuff in addition to editing software, but most of it is done better by others and all it really does is make loading longer and more annoying.In editing, you don't get a full screen as it has ""tools"" all over the place simply providing clutter. It's non inuitive and the manual? is really a joke. You are forced into buying a supplemental user guide to try and figure out what makes this program tick.If you've got Version 2, stick with it and if your interested in being a first time buyer, save yourself a lot of money and buy a used or heavily discounted version of the previous version."
4,Great biography!,"It's a good book,but it lacks detail.I kept getting Margaret Beaufort and Margaret Pole mixed up because it didn't explain better. Still,it has good stuff because it has feeling; you can feel how daring Catherine Howard felt,you can feel the disapointment of poor Bloody Mary.It almost makes up for what it lacks."
2,Item doesnt fit Xterra Supercharger,Buyer CAUTION: This wire set can't be used on 2002-2004 Xterra Supercharger. I didn;t reutrn the item because i lost the original box.
1,Worst blu-ray ever for sound quality,"Thalia is a wonderful singer and this should be a great concert but it is mixed WAY TOO LOUD!!! She has some very tallented musicians but all I hear is a WALL OF NOISE behind her. There is no detail or definition in the music. Even the ballads sound harsh. I can understand (but not like) a sound engineer brick-walling a song for radio, but it should never, ever be done to a blu-ray. There is simply no excuse for making a blu-ray sound this horrible."
5,Some great work,"I'd definitely recommend this - some of Thalia's best work. The singing is very sensitive and powerful at the same time and the concert is expressive, passionate, and intimate. I loved every bit of it!"
2,2 songs are good,"I was disappointed in this album. The best is the one by leonine (sp?). So just buy luaka bop's best of album, you won't feel you have wasted the money."
3,Good but definitely not green,"This product is one of the all time tried and tested window cleaners. It performs very well, but no better than other brands. If you are looking for ""Green"" then this may not be for you.Whilst this does a good job, and is priced reasonably, it is not green as claimed by the other reviewer.in July 2011 SC Johnson announced it will stop using its Greenlist logo on U.S. Windex products as part of the resolution to two lawsuits. The Greenlist was an internally developed process, not some 3rd party standard. It is very easy to meet your own self imposed goals. Slapping a ""Green"" logo on things is a great marketing tool, whilst no necessary having anything to do with being environmentally friendly. Even SC Johnson admitted ""we could have been more transparent about what the logo signified"".Is it Green? Who knows, we only have SC Johnson's made up logo to validate their claims. A logo they then agreed to remove."
5,"Sharp, witty and interesting in every episode.","We love ""The Closer"". A terrific cast, excellent writing, engrossing procedural. Too bad they through in a little too much ""fluff"" towards the end of the series (we don't think Brenda's mother and father added anything to the plots). But we watch the episodes over and over again."
5,Brenda's doing it again,I was late to start watching the Closer on tv and no sooner did I find that it is a great show than it was in it's last season. So I am so glad to be able to buy the season's I missed. I go through Amazon on my Roku and the whole thing is just great. It's a good show to watch and Amazon and Roku make it easy to obtain and watch. Before then I was buying dvd's and they were over running my house.
5,Love the design,I have had my set of Yamazaki Aquatique Ice for 6 years now. I loved it when I bought it and I still love it 6 years later. It has held up very well and I would highly recommend it if you can afford it.
3,Dance With Me : The Best Of Orleans,"I bought this CD to use at my wedding reception because it contained the song ""You're Still The One"". The song and the CD did not disappoint. I'm really glad I bought the CD. Plus, I really enjoyed reading the information that came with the CD. I learned things about the group I would never have known otherwise."
5,a guide to life and love,"To say that I love Romain Gary would be a euphemism. Not only is he most certainly the best author, with a prose matched by none other and the magical tone of old russian storytellers, Romain Gary is one of the few existentialists to possess a desperately hopeful outlook on life. This book is probably one of his best, if not the best, and the kind of unconditional love he describes in ""the ski bum"" is one that overrides any of the curveballs life may throw. It is easy to love when everything is going fine, but to love against all odds and most of all against one's own plans is most definitely the true sign of the only valid ethic in life, an esthetic assumed to the point of death itself. Thank you, Romain, for showing me and so many others the path to a life designed like a art masterpiece."
5,Things ARE Swingin',"This is another ""Swingin...'"" cd from the late 50's Capitol catalog, like Sinatra's ""Songs for Swingin' Lovers"" or Deano's ""This Time I'm Swingin'"". It has the classic, warm '50's era Capitol stereo sound too (with the exception of ""You Don't Know"" and ""Fever"" in mono due to technical problems at the time of the recording).Peggy Lee's voice is in great form and the song performances are wonderful, especially ""It's a Wonderful World"", ""It's Been a Long, Long Time"", ""Life is for Livin'"" and, of course, ""Fever"". It also includes two numbers she penned, the title track ""Things Are Swingin'"" and ""It's a Good, Good Night"", both of which stand up well, and in some cases better, with the other tunes. A great singer and a talented songwriter!This is one of those cds that gets many plays in my player: no dust collecting here. It's a classic. Please Capitol, more original releases by Peggy Lee!"
4,its ok,i think this single was ok. i like the song alot but its better if you buy the whole cd cuz all the songs on the cd are good.
2,"Slow, fragile and expensive replacement filter","This filter is appealing for it's size. I used it for about 5 trips. You need patience to fill one litre bottle... Be careful on the pressure you apply when you pump. The gray cap is fragile and I eventually broke it. By looking at the price of the replacement filter, I realized it was better to buy a new one and I got the Katadyn varia. I am satisfied with it. The replacement parts are less expensive and the water flow is a lot more faster."
2,Wrong version of Mr. Businessman?,"I've got a copy of Mr. Businessman taped from the radio in the early 70's and I believe it's the original ""hit"" version. It matches the AMG sample from Jukebox Hits of 1968, Vol. 1, but it has a significantly different vocal (more forceful, different phrasing) from the version on this Rhino compilation (judging from the samples here and at AMG).I thought we were supposed to be able to trust Rhino to either snag the originals or scrap the compilation. Anybody know what the story is with this one? Are there other tracks here that aren't the hit versions?"
2,Long and drawn out,This story just didn't hold my interest. I felt the characters were very brash and it didn't really matter to me who ended up with who. Usually I get attached to a character but not in this case. Glad I didn't pay for it.
1,Had to put this one away....,I started this one and could just not get into it. I found that it dragged and was boring. I never understood the relationship at all. I kept waiting for something to happen and it was just the same push pull back and forth. I ended up shelving this one because I was just bored!
3,a book that made me hmmm,"I like the book. The whole story is well somewhere on the side of ""real world"" and ""fiction world"". I know this is fiction though I believe a good book is somewhere in the line of 'I know that could happened in real life'.Will is not a bit realistic (in my opinion) his background and the way he is describe and act is somewhat contradicting. He is aggressive but can't face his problem.I like Patsy though she is so, I would say, a free spirited though a bit confused to what she really like. She wants to move out because she has this idea that all will be better because she will start somethig new. (I guess some people are somewhere along these line)Also I like how the author incorporate daisy flower ,which means innocence, to the story."
3,Love is All Around,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews. It did not hold my attention for long. Part of the story was cute and I chuckled because it felt ""real"" but I had to keep coming back to the book. That being said, I give the author credit, it is not easy to write."
4,Love is All Around (Looking for Love),It is a very good book. I haven't finished it yet. The characters are very believably realistic. I enjoy reading romance novels. I am hoping that Patsy will finally be happy.
2,Not as interesting as I thought it would be,"The chapter intros, where we got to ""meet"" the important scientists, were always interesting, but the papers were boring, as I predicted they would be. I got it from the library so no big loss to me other than time.This book was a wonderful concept that just doesn't fly."
4,Happy Customer,I was happy with this product and it met my expectations. I will recommend it to other potential buyers as it's historical content is of great value in our current troubled times.
4,A small book but it delievers as promised,The recipes are simple and no photos. I recomend this book for people who enjoy baking cookies. Can't beat the price and yes you have to enjoy sugar.
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about auras and chakras. The DVD starts with a guy with girl hair talking for a minute and then putting on some woman with big hair and a low cut blouse who calls herself the ""vagina doctor."" I honestly went back to amazon.com to make sure I had not accidentally ordered some weird porn. This DVD is like an SNL spoof! I could not believe that they were actually trying to be serious. Then, to top it off, the next guest he brings on is a woman who calls herself an ""urban mermaid,"" who sings some hippie song at the end. They are all about promoting their personal websites and just being as strange as they can be. I actually lent this DVD to others just because they couldn't believe it could really be THAT weird...but we are all in agreement that IT IS! If you are looking for something to watch while stoned, this would be it. If you are looking to learn more about auras and chakras, look elsewhere."
3,U.S. History for Dummies,"This book was more of a fun fact book than a history book. The author fills the book with information not relevant to important history, and skimps on the important stuff. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone over the age of 10!"
5,"funny, and fun to sing with","this cd is worth a buy, if you enjoy light hearted fun, and singing along with cds. i dont remember much of the Space Ghost, but i do remember enough to get who is who on the songs."
4,Fit well.,"This dash kit fits well in my '04 PT Cruiser; the mounting holes and front were spot-on. The only issue I had was the front of my radio was a bit too square to fit well, I just had to file the opening to fit. Still looks great, though."
4,Hilarious and made by the X-Files people.,"Hilarious, inexpensive, and made by the X-Files people. Goofy nerds, computer hackers, government agents, spies, conspiracy theories; this series had so much potential that I have no idea why they never made a second season. CAVEAT: there is something weird about the pilot episode that made me check its publication date. Yep. It was before the 9/11 terrorist attack on New York. I wonder if Osama watched it."
4,Fun Little Series,"Wow, the pilot features a plot to fly a plane into the Twin Towers! Was Chris Carter psychic? Cool little series with fun characters."
2,Absolutely silly,"I watched the X Files fanatically during its run (and now on reruns at the SciFi channel), and always loved the gunmen. I knew the spinoff was likely to be absolutely ludicrous (hard to imagine they could hold their own story together, as lovable as they were; plus it was cancelled after half a season) and I wasn't wrong. But I love the show so much that I enjoy the sillness and have gotten a real kick out of having the episodes play in the background - Tom Braidwood wearing fake nipples for breastfeeding was a bonus - and would recommend to fans of X Files who don't take themselves too seriously."
2,Nothing like how it's described,"I purchased this thinking it would look very nice on my table. WRONG!!! It is very poorly made and appears to be cheap looking. I expected stainless steel, but got something more on the chipped, plastic side. I am extremely disappointed. I would never recommend this item to family or friends."
5,Love it!,"I love the look of this product. It does what I needed it to do....keep a place for the salt, pepper, and napkins. Simple and looks great on my countertop."
5,"Tested with Multi-meter, Good Batteries Great Price","These batteries are a bargain price but great Energizer quality. The packaging looks different than the picture but I don't think it really matters that they are in bulk packaging since they are still factory sealed and the packaging goes in the trash anyway. The first thing I did when I received these was test them with a multi-meter and they both read 3.29 volts DC, which should be good for a 3.0 volt battery."
4,"Batteries work, but are OLD from 2006.....",I ordered one set of 2016 3v Energizer batteries. The batteries are Energizer but they came in 2 individual aluminum packets rather than the advertised 2-pack. The date on the back of the each packet says 2006. We'll see if that effects the battery life......many months later batteries still work.
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this package of two because the price was right. I needed one right away for a watch, and figured I'd keep the other as a spare. What's shown isn't what was delivered. Two single batteries on separate tear-off sheets were sent. I put the first one in the watch, and nothing happened. I triple checked all my work, and as a last resort put a volt meter to the battery. 2.15 volts. Not enough to run the watch. The second one topped out over 3 volts (normal), so I used that one.Bottom line, you may be paying twice as much for a working battery as you expected."
2,Did not last a full year,"I don't think these were completely new. Or either they did not pass the 3V test and were sold cheap, and now resold here. Mine lasted 7 months in a garage door opener."
5,Batteries were fabulous...replacing them not the problem of the batteries...,...on an Iron Man Timex watch.....these batteries worked perfectly......replacing them myself..................that was a problem but had nothing to do with the quality of the batteries of course. NOTE: THEY ARRIVED IN A TEEEENY envelope...could have gotten lost literally in the bunch of mail that arrived. Other than that ... perfectly satisfied.
2,Came with bad connection. Company won't respond to emaills. Avoid.,"The ear buds seem to work ok for the rest of the band, but mine came with a bad connection. The company has not replied to my emails to them. You would probably be better off getting custom molded ones for about the same price."
5,Great Fit and Easy to Install,Installed these visors on my 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500HD. Nicely packed with easy to follow instructions. Installed in under 20 minutes. I really like the look as well as the ability to crack my windows without the chance of rain getting in. Highly recommended!
2,"Content seemed great, but not explained in detail","When I first bought this book, I was very hopeful. The book seemed to cover a lot of relevant material, in a concise fashion. When I tried to read it however, I found it a little bit too much on the concise side. I have read very complicated books with a lot of math before, and I could follow them easier than this ""easy"" writing style. Almost every subject is covered in other books in more detail and better. Sometimes it's nice to have a simpler book which is an introduction, and that is what I was hoping for, but this just didn't do it for me.I donated the book to the library,as I felt I would never really get too much out of it. This didn't stop me from buying Mr. Razavi's ""Design of Analog CMOS ICs "" and I liked his tutorial in the IEEE Phase Lock Loop book he edited.I know he can do a better job."
5,This is a jewel of a novel,"A heart breaking, encouraging, and enlightening historical novel on the life of this young woman seeking freedom for her gender during very trying times. I wish I could get the next novel by Mourad on the same series ""The Garden of Badalpour"" unfortunately is only available in French for now."
4,No complaints,Product shipped fast w/Amazon PRIME....Unit pretty easy to assemble/instructions okay....other then no bolts to attach to a standard bed frame no issues....
1,To Big!!!!,"It looks sweet, but it is too big. Not sure if they sent me the wrong one, but its more a Queen size. If you don't have some fancy bed skirt then you see the cheep wood at the back/side."
1,very bad quality,"I JUST GOT THIS ITEM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, VERY BAD PRODUCT, CAME BROKEN IN TWO PIECES.im hoping for my money back.Maria, Lexington,Ky"
2,bolla,"I brought this product thinking that it will fit to my queen bed frame but unfortunately its not. Also the hardware not providing with it not fair. Remember, hardware not included. I do not recommend this if you are looking for queen bed set."
1,"looks nice, barely stays attached, flimsy","The headboard looks nice, but I had to push the bed all the way against the wall to try and prevent it from snapping off! It's very flimsy and sways easily when you touch it at all--and my husband added extra screws to try and firm it up. It's just really cheap wood. I would send it back, but it's all put together and I can barely move the bed without pieces breaking off. The platform part is horrible. It's that pressed sawdust wood so with any pressure, the screws will pull right through it. Don't buy!!!!"
5,"Engrossing, thought-provoking, empathic and well-written","I found myself constantly surprised by the profound concern and sadness Faludi's writing evoked in me. Her interviews illustrated the many layered betrayal men in our society face. Faludi proposes that old paradigms of masculinity (and femininity) which once served as means of self-definition can no longer function in today's consumer culture. Faludi posits that a new self-definition for both men and women based on humanity, not masculinity or femininity but instead masculinity AND femininity, may ultimately address the ills both men and women now face."
3,not stiffed,"Sauldi does an lot of generalizing about an interesting subject. Her thesis will be highly useful for a subset of male culture and therefore can be a good place to get insights for pastoral care for men and women. It would be dangerous to extend her ideas to all men or culture at large, to overlook the dysfunction of the women in her stories, or ignore the general dynamics of family systems. She misses a part of the aerospace/military industry of the 1950's-70's. For the typical engineer it was often a nomadic culture where they followed the contracts from company to company, or from loser to winner until the late 1980's. She should heed the fact that she didn't lock up a solid premise. Douglas Aircraft was always looked upon as a step child to the McDonnell Corp., down to the way they placed the logo on drafting pencils for the left handed reader, so ""Douglas"" was ground off before ""McDonnell."""
2,Interesting but overreaching,"Tendentious and much too long. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Bill, Washington"
3,Miffed,Ms. Faludi has written an oftentimes unreadable book about men throughout the last century. What this book needed was a really good editor. What we have is a book that no man or woman would pick up after a hard day at work with screaming kids in the backround to relax with. It's tedious in many ways and doesn't help the people it should be by making it so long and repetitious. Ms. Faludi is not the first to tackle this issue and she won't be the last.If she was really interested in helping the plight of men she should of have been thinking of them and not herself and how long her book could be. More isn't always better.
5,Is he man or is he really a female,This book was an execellent work on what has happened to the American man since World War II. This book dives into how the promises made to men by their fathers have not been fulfilled. The book looks at marginale men who have been marginalized by the American culture that has seized to be utilitarian--values hardwork. But instead the culture is an ornamental culture where it is all about the name brand. This book succeeds in exposing what has happening because the author goes directly to those who have been hurt by society. The author gets into the groups of men who have been hurt. Men's traditional role in society is not the same as it has been--that that role is not needed. So men feel that they are not necessarily needed. Men pack together because of this! churley@ozarks.edu
1,Don't buy it!,"This is the worst! This movie is about bobby's birthday party, not going potty! Every so often they mention going potty, but really the focus is the party. Half the songs don't even relate to going potty. They sing ABC's etc....they sing about Bobby being a big boy now that he is 4 and how he does all these things, not one of the things mentioned is about going potty!We also bought Potty power....it is great! The whole dialoge is related to going potty. Much better! This movie just made me angry that I spent $20 on it. Total waste!!!!"
5,Potty Time DVD,"I agree with most of the other parents--cheeessy!! Adults will be rolling their eyes, but the kids love it! and it works, so what more can you ask? My son sings the songs while going to the potty, washing hands, etc. He was almost potty trained, this DVD helped us complete the job. (along with the trips to the toy store, and promise of being able to go to school)It is certainly worth trying."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!,"I have a 2 year old who always enjoys a new DVD. We were so excited about a new ""potty time"" video but, this really SUCKS! It's all about a 4 Year old who has a birthday party. Does not focus on Potty Time at all. A REAL WASTE OF MONEY! I would recommend ""Potty Time with Bear"" it really focuses on potty training and really caught my daughters attention."
5,works great,These cat candy molds worked great. They made a perfect party favor for my daughter's kitty party. They were a big hit!
2,Pass it by,"The story had the potential to be much more inspiring,amusing and promotional of chess. It disappoints on these fronts.She is clearly a great actress as is Kline but the somewhat sombre style of the film results in a missed opportunity."
4,Journal: The Short Life and Mysterious Death of Amy Zoe Mason,I thought this book was most interesting. The format is intriquing as it is journaled on another book. I gave it to 3 friends who loved it and in turn gave it as gifts to other friends. One of the best reviews a book can get is the readers willingness to pass it on to someone else.
3,Nice idea but the mystery is weak.,Just received the book today and could not wait to sit down with it. The pages are beautiful and interesting to look at. The story manages to keep the reader's attention but I think the end of the book becomes pretty obvious by the middle. I won't go into detail for those who have not read it but the likely ending becomes very apparent very quickly as well as who is most likely responsible. Not sure it is worth the money unless you just enjoy owning beautiful books. Otherwise one can easily get through the whole book in an hour in the bookstore or library.
5,froggy book,i bought this for my nephew and the frog pillow pet.. he loves frogs and this book is just too cute. he loves it and its well worth it for the price and the fun that he gets out of it.
3,"Cute, but pictures are a bit scary","My daughter (now 1) loves animals and pop-up books. I got this and while the story is funny (have heard the joke as an adult), the pictures and the noses that pop out at you as you read are a bit scary... Not a bad book-- and she does seem to enjoy it-- but there are much better pop-ups (more happy/kid-friendly) out there for toddlers to enjoy."
4,Incredible,"...guitar playing, that is. David (if I may, so informally call him by his first name) is an incredible gutarist, and that would have gotten him a 5, if it weren't for his obssesion of covering other songs. Yes, there are a few original songs on the CD, but most are just songs written by other blues artists, and who knows... maybe the originals are better (never heard them, personally). So it comes down to you chosing if you value physical (guitar playing), or mental (composition) talent, more. He is an incredible guitarist, so even if you do value mental talent, I'm sure there's some of that in his string plucking... and original songs for that matter."
2,Difficult to ride,"Very hard for a 2 year old to ride, even had my neighbors try to ride it and didn't go too well. The pedals are too far away to be effective"
4,Not too shabby...,"This toy of S.S. Gohan is very cool to look at and fly around in. It looks like gohan, and the jet is pretty cool because I think it can get damaged and something comes off that just hooks back on, but not sure. The only downside is that the gohan figure is made more to be on the jet than off so he can't fight as good as other toys."
3,Pretty Basic,The book arrived very quickly . . .but all the questions were very basic . . not the best book for getting to know the ins and outs of someone.
3,Decent medium-sized technical dictionary,"This dictionary was a very helpful addition. It even has some computing terms in it. As long as you can deal with all the British English, it's a good resource. Honestly, though, if you're serious about your terms you'll need a bigger dictionary than this. I don't use this one much anymore now that I bought Kunnskapsforlaget's Norsk-Engelsk Teknisk Ordbok by Jan E. Prestester. The Prestester dictionary is more helpful."
4,Good experince,"I had to replace a broken Original intake, the cost was quite expensive, so I choose to upgrade to a cold air intake system instead, it was about the same money anyway. My choice to try the AEM was due to their reputation and other users comments. It has been 5 months, and I am very happy with my intake.I have not seen any improvement in MPG, and not a hugh difference in accelleration either, but in does not choke or spudder ever, and was pretty easy to install.Ford Focus 02 ZTS auto"
4,a great story,"This is a very nice book and it tells the real story of Mulan, even though the Disney version was okay, but in my opinion, they mixed Chinese and Japanese (Mulan was a Chinese hero)... I have read a better version of Mulan, so thats why I gave it a 4 star"
2,East of Interesting,"Suzann Ledbetter spent more time creating interesting scenery than fleshing out two very flat characters. The romance between these two dimensional people felt forced at best. I skimmed through the book and found myself skipping large sections. In the end, it was a very disapointing novel. I actually tossed it across the room when I was done, angry with myself for not setting it aside when I was bored at page 50."
3,not what I hoped it would be,"OK...it's my fault for not reading the reviews before I ordered it. BUT what I expected was Steiner's score. It's there alright, but often obscured by dialog. Love the movie and the screenplay, but what always stays in the memory is the music. So, friends, if you want to hear that great cast in some of the great scenes, by all means play the DVD. For those of us who just want the great Max, there are other CDs. I'll be ordering them today."
1,Don't buy the Kindle vesion,"I purchased this based upon the reviews that were very good, but if you are looking to buy this for the Kindle, don't!. The examples are listed in such a way that you can't read them on the Kindle. The regular expression matches are listed by showing the matches with a light gray behind the match. You can't see it at all on the Kindle. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't making sense to me, so I got my hands on a printed version and saw what I was missing was the whole key to the book."
1,"Houston, we have a problem...","I don't know if every copy of the book is like this, but mine was printed so faintly that the highlighting of the examples was too faint to see. What this means is that the examples in the book (and there are a lot of them... that is the primary method of teaching in the book) are useless without the accompanying text. The accompanying text is quite good and thorough, but I wouldn't recommend this book at all unless you're sure they've fixed the problem at the printer."
1,Useless,"In the book introduction the author correctly states that most regexp texts and tutorial tend to concentrate just on the ""easy"" part: regexp syntax illustrated with a few examples, and do not give the reader even a little mastery in the art of using them. He then proceeds to writing another short and sweet useless syntax illustration. This ""book"" has no more useful material than you can find in a free web tutorial, so I suggest you save your money and stick with those, or go for a book that's worth some money: ""Mastering Regular Expressions"" by O' Reilly."
1,What a joke!!,I started to read the book (Kindle) and I became very angry of seeing that was completly useless. The format is incorrect so you can't read what is the result from the regex.I asked for a refund and I have downloaded the PDF book...
3,One great song,"""You Look Bad When You're Naked"" is a great song, with hilarious lyrics and a funky sound (due to a dilapidated piano), but the rest of the songs on this CD vary from decent to blah. The title track (written after 9/11) is touching."
3,"Good to have her back, but...","Hugo Largo was certainly one of the best unknown bands ever, and it should have had a much greater audience. DRUM was a miraculous ear opener and METTLE contains some of the most beautiful melodies ever recorded. Mimi Goese's voice is haunting, ethereal and unusually warm. When I heard that she recorded again I bought the CD at once. To my delight, Mimi is still much as I recalled her from the Hugo Largo era. To my dissapointment, she barely exploits the unique qualities of her voice. SOAK sounds too correct, too plain, when I expected her to take me to peaks and depths, just like she did with Hugo Largo. P.S.: I will also buy her next CD. I can't help it."
3,I hope not to use this,"When I read ""2-year extended service contract"" I thought that meant beyond the warranty provided by Samsung, but in fact it starts with the purchase date (not even when you recieve the product)...so it is misleading until you read the extended fine print!"
2,Not for Floridians,"Great company, excellent customer service. The policy has Florida exclusions which I don't feel, are justified. Read before you buy."
4,Is this a kid's movie?,"I liked this movie and it was a cool idea. They combine ideas from other Disney princess stories like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella: They make fun of thier own ideas! It starts out cartoon and then turns into a real-people movie. Giselle, (the princess) has revealing dresses. ALL off her dresses are revealing and she is almost shown naked in one scene. she and a guy kiss in it and well, this isn't really a kid's movie if you count the two things I said were in this movie. I gave it 4 stars because I liked it, but the things Disney added aren't so clean."
4,An Awesome Disney Film!!!,"I thought this was really good and very funny! I love how it goes from cartoon to live-action! Giselle is forced down a portal by an evil Queen, and ends up in New York City. A man named Robert helps her. She stays with him and his daughter, Morgan. It has a classic fish-out-of-water story. Robert tries to show her how things are in the real world. I highly recommend ENCHANTED!!!"
5,Great movie for all ages,"My family loves this movie. It appeals to all ages, especially little girls who are into princesses. For adults, it offers a lot of humor and is overall very entertaining. A must have!"
4,fairy tale,"Giselle (Amy Adams) finds herself in Manhattan and is befriended by Robert (P. Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan. Meanwhile, Edward's mother (S. Sarandon) will stop at nothing to keep Gisell from ending up with her son. So... will Edward (J. Marsden), Giselle's true love, find her? And is Edward truly Giselle's true love?A very entertaining romantic fairy tale, with splendid acting from all, especially Amy Adams. She clearly has a lot of talent, in acting and singing. Susan Sarandon is especially vicious as the stepmother. Marsden and Dempsey are fantastic too.Nice directing. Good photography.The transition between animation and ""reality"" was interesting and well done.The songs are rather kitsch, it is a movie for children mostly, so what else is to be expected?Enjoyable for all."
2,so so,its good. at the begining i was dissapointed but it got better as it went on. its very boring to watch a second time though.
3,I was cute but not a good ending for my 4 yr old,"I thought it was a really cute movie but if you like the classics like my daughter and I do, you may not be too happy with the end of this one. My daughter and I were riveted until the very end and then all I heard was how much she didn't like it. As you can see from the adds, it's your classic fairy tale in modern day. BUT, my 4 yr old (and I) still like the originals when the ""Prince"" marries the ""Princess"".It was a cute movie but with an unwanted end."
4,good,"We like the movie and watch it in our van while we drive, or at least we used to before we grew tired of it. We recommend it to anyone who likes to have fun while they work."
4,You can laugh,"It is very difficult for me to laugh in movies, but this movie does the trick. If you are looking to relax and enjoy a good comedy, this movie is it !"
1,The original is better,"This is a parody of ""The Sleeping Beauty"", a classic that is now coming to Blu-ray. But unlike that wonderful, carefully planed classic which took the Disney studio almost a decade to develop, Enchanted lacks sincerity.It pretends to put the fairy tale world upside down and teach a couple of things about ""true love"", but instead ends up reaffirming the fairy tale concepts, but without the class and elegance of the original. In fact, bad taste is all over the place: Almost-nudity, a joke involving faeces, talk about boys wanting ""only one thing"", easy jokes copied from Shrek and ""Splash"", a nauseating musical number in Central Park...If you're still itching to know what Enchanted is all about, rent it before buying. And buy The Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray."
3,fun for everyone,"This film is fun and entertaining without being too, too sweet. It's Disney without the extra mushy fairy tale-ness. My family loves it, even my three year-old, though she doesn't get all of the jokes and references(which is fine with me)."
5,Family entertainment,"My wife and I purchased this for a holiday family get-together. Young and old, we watched the movie. It was entertaining, the characters were funny, the story was light hearted and no one, young or old, got up to do something else while it was playing. If I were a stickler, I thought the princess in a bathtowel sequence was a little... mature, and probably the reason the movie is PG and not G, but it was played as slapstick and it wasn't in the least bit revealing or sexual."
3,No music..,It would have been much better if any lights or music. Kids bored after few plays. Also the picture for each number is not so great. The pro side is easy to put the puzzle and bright colors.
5,None better,"You know how everything tasted better when you were a kid? Well not so with lemon drops. The naturals lemon candies have a nice smooth flavor that never at like anything but fresh lemon pie, highly recommended!"
3,A bit on the dark side,This was not my favorite Anne Stuart book. I found I didn't really like Rachael until the very end of the book and I never did take a liking to Luke who came across as an egotistical con artist who was very greedy and proud of it.
1,Not Romantic,"Rape is not romantic. A hero who rapes the heroine is not someone I want to see end up with the heroine. As a thriller, it was ok. As a romance, not good."
1,Poor Quality/Way Overpriced,"Don't waste your money! Fabric and quality are of typical cheap ""china made"". The cost of almost $50 for each top and bottom are ridiculous. Maybe if the set were priced at a total of $25-30 it might be worth it. Fit is also slim fitting and not for averaged sized woman."
1,Quantity not as says.,In the product description it says you will receive 24/5.5 ounce cans of cat food. When received in the mail I received ONE can of cat food. It also says shipping weight is 10 pounds and turned out to be under one pound. They have false advertising! No wonder this turns out to be so cheap.
3,Frustrating For the Price,"While I must admit the chair is lovely when complete, the instructions and hardware included were lacking. The instructions were wrong and once we figured that out, it went much smoother. Also, there was not enough hardware included to complete the chair. Yes, we were able to visit the local hardware store to remedy this, but why should you have to. My husband is not looking forward to putting the second chair together!!! I must say though, on the manufacturers behalf, it gets nothing but compliments and is worth the frustration."
5,I like this creme,I like this creme to tame my summer frizzies. Even in the cold winter it keeps my hair smooth and tangle free.
3,"Okay, but doesn't control all frizz","I was hoping for a product that greatly reduced the frizz, doesn't seem to be one out there, though this helps my curls a lot!"
3,Helps keep a nice curl but not with the friz,"It works well with keeping a nice looking curl; however, it doesn't really work on the friz part. Don't need it"
2,songs are not in original order,"i really wanted this, but it looks as though if the songs are in the wrong order than on the original albums. why would you change the order of the songs? thats just stupid, you wouldn't change the order of Kind of Blue or A Love Supreme or anything would you? why do it here?"
3,Cute but I would pass if I were you.,"I received this ring as an early Christmas gift from my husband and loved it initially. I am crazy about dragonflies and this one is adorable and the perfect size. It's not too big nor too small. Now for the not so good parts: I have had this ring for less than 24 hours and it has already started to turn my finger green. I'm very disappointed because a sterling silver ring should not turn your finger green like that. More than likely this ring is simply plated with silver. This is false advertising and horrible business practices. Also, I highly doubt that the turquoise stones are real. The actual stones that come in the ring are a little off color from what a typical turquoise stone looks like. Bottom line is that I like this ring, but I don't think it was worth the $25 my husband paid for it since nothing seems to be real."
3,"Beautiful design, but stones appear fake","I received the ring in a timely matter, it even came in a beautiful pink box wrapped up. I think it looks pretty and is nicely designed, but I am a big fan of turquoise and these stones don't look genuine. They also appear glued on rather then set in the metal. It is a nice ring and I wear it every day, but if you are actually looking for the stone turquoise I wouldn't suggest it."
2,a fourth side,"I thought this book was very entertaining, had a lot of anecdotal examples, and some very well worn ideas. Gee, I was surprised that a third party could some times settle an argument through compromise. Who knew! And it only took a couple of hundred pages to tell the same story over and over."
1,Do not buy this CD!,What a waste. Is this bad music? Not really. Is it the best choice for Lindy Hopping? No! It is one of the worst compilations out there in fact. This is a result of people that teach at a general dance studio trying to be cool and find music you can swing to--while not being swing music. Or perhaps they couldn't secure the rights to anything else??? Could you dance to these songs? I guess. Do I want to? No way.
2,Disappointing,"As the first reviewer said, this is not Lindy Hop music. Aside from the Royal Crown Revue track, it is maybe West Coast Swing music at best. Great for WCS, but not for Lindy or even East Coast."
4,Its the trio with a difference,"I found something very special about this CD. There are many live recordings of Jarret with Dejonnette and Peacock. But this one is different. It is much softer and gentler. I put it down to Jack who on this CD sounds more like Paul Motian than he does like himself. This recording is one of my favourites along with ""Deer Head Inn"" (where Motian is the drummer). I guess this critique is a form of feedback to Jack to tone it down. This is not to say that he does not compliment the trio, he does, but I find his playing a little ""one size fits all"", when it fits (Live at the Blue Note and here) its brilliant, but other times you would want him to play a little more melodic. In this album he gets it just right."
5,"An unexpected, wonderful collection of original stories","Stars deserves ongoing mention as an extraordinary collection of science fiction inspired by the music of folk singer Janis Ian. Janis invited respected authors in the genre to contribute works influenced by her songs: the result is an unexpected, wonderful collection of original stories - based on her music, but no prior familiarity with Ian is required in order to enjoy these varied tales."
2,"Terrible customer service, high price","The product arrived poorly and inadequately packaged, so the tray was cracked. I contacted the mfg directly for a replacement tray. I was given one excuse after another why they could not ship a replacement right away - they were having problems with cracked trays, they had a big warehouse sale, they were too busy this week, etc. After several weeks passed and no replacement tray was forthcoming I warned the mfg I would need to return the product if I did not get a new tray. Still no reponse so I searched for a replacement pen and found a superior product with a tray and a removeable top for less money and returned this product. The quality of the product was decent, but the customer service was unacceptable and price was not a good value."
2,Disappointed...,"I recently had an opportunity to see the show live in Richmond, Va. I purchased this DVD thinking it might be fairly close to the quality of the show I saw in person. I was wrong! This DVD is outdated, and rather poorly done. I wished ""they"" had taped the show I witnessed--it was an awesome non-stop show featuring top quality guitarist from beginning to end! Producer: Please take the hint! It's time for a newer ""Hendrix Experience"" DVD."
4,"Mars Electric is a ""shocking"" good time.","A good friend introduced me to this band well before their debut release, and I have to say I was, and still am impressed. Many bands come and go these days looking for nothing but fame. Though that may be the intentions of Jacob and his crew, their stuff certainly doesn't sound fuled by greed and girls. (Well ok, maybe the latter)With a generous dose of very well conceived guitar riffs and perfecly timed drums, this entire album has a good, down to earth feeling without trying to be something their not. But they still rock! With this said, the album doesn't come with out its flaws. As does every other record in this Rock/Pop genre, we have heard this all before. But Mars Electric puts a certain spin on the sound of a well worn genre dominated by well worn artists.. This one is well worth your hard earned buck."
5,Great !,This is an excellent cookbook. The authour is a former cook for a school. Her form scratch recipes are excellent. The bread recipes are my favorite.
5,Best of the West,"This is a fabulous, intelligent, soul-full melange of funky base lines, hot riffs and quirky lyrics. Luke, Howard and Chang are true masters. Their music is a blend of true glam rock, infused with surf punk attitude, poetry of the bard, with a healthy dose of social commentary. This CD is never boring. Everytime I listen to it there is something new to hear. If you ever get a chance to see these guys live, swim across lakes, travel in snowstorms, walk a hundred miles to get there."
2,neverwinter nights 2,"Neverwinter Nights 2 (DVD-ROM)I'm disappointed in the game because being out so long. Its still full of bugs. Icant get tochapter 2 because the game crashes during uploading ,and i'cant find afix."
2,Not quite what I expected.,I recently purchased a Toshiba 32 inch HDTV and purchased the extended warranty presented to me during the checkout process. I assumed as most extended warranties start when the original warranty ends. Not true. Reading the fine print when I received the policy it states that this service plan starts immediately and runs concurrently with the manufacturer's warranty. This effectively reduces my 2 year extended warranty to a single year. The site and the policies should be clearer. I may not have purchased this knowing it was a single year policy.
5,Good quality CD holder.,This product was purchased for my daughter and she is very happy with it. I would buy other products from this company again.
3,Just ok,"I first off was like most other people who wanted this movie, I love Gale Harold and think he's a great actor.Also Michelle Clunie from QAF is in this also.The movie was just ok for me though, all the perfomances were great, but I guess I was expecting more from the story. The trailer you watch makes you think you're going to see something completly differnt when that's not the case at all.I watched it once and probably won't again for a long time if ever."
1,Poor reliability,"I purchased the TRU9380-3 from Office Max 18 months ago. I've had many problems with the phone, primarily with the function key. Four handsets were replace within the one year warranty period. Even the replacement handsets had to be replaced. The system is now out of the one year warranty, and none of the function keys operate on any of the handsets. I can't turn off the ringers, access caller ID, or access the phone book. So disappointed. Today, I purchased a new AT&T cordless phone system and am tossing the Uniden out. I did notify Uniden of my dissatisfaction. I would stay away from this product."
3,Curious and Curiouser,"I found this to be a very strange little book. I thought it was actually going to go somewhere but when I finished reading it I realized I was right where I started. It was interesting, but just not something I could get into. I had no idea who she was before I picked the book up. I thought the title was cool and read it based on that. Hmmm, maybe I should re-think how I choose books at the library."
1,Spectacular Photos but find a guide elsewhere,"There are gorgeous railroad photographs here that will inspire you to do the same. However, the advice was very weak. Some was head scratching like ""Here in the sunrise section I'm showing you a sunset""...?"
5,Most used book,"We have had 7 Danes, my son has two labs, my daughter one yorkie and we have one pit.. needless to say this is the most used book in my house.. if something happens before we can call a vet.. we all use this.. in fact I bought a copy for my daughter..."
1,This doll looks like a drag queen,"Oh god some of these barbies are ugly. I used to collect these things now i look at most of them and i think what was i thinking wasting my money on these ugly, guady, overprice dolls. Why is it that every holiday doll that matel has done since 1988 has always had big puffy hair and a a big dress. Why cant matel make dolls in these series and other similar series that have a more modern look to them. LIke can you ever see anyone where this dress in public and if a movie star wore it they would be put on a worst dress list. One more thing why can't bob mackie design something more modern and do you see any ladie on the red carpet saying that there dress is a Bob Mackie. Mattel needs to get more hip, trendy designers working for them."
3,It is what it is,"Ok, there are still wires. They go from this ""wireless"" unit to the back speakers. The good news is there are no wires coming from the main unit (by the tv). The back speakers work and sound good. I had heard some people having issues using a wireless internet connection near this unit. That is the case with me. While the card is in the main unit and it is turned on, my internet connection does not work. It doesn't matter whether the speakers are being used or not.I bought a refurbished unit for a fraction of the cost of a new one. It was in its original packaging. No problems there. I would do that again, saved a lot of money."
3,Not so wireless surround speakers,"This unit was ordered with my SC-HT740 5 DVD Home Theater System. It came separately from Office Depot, taking almost a week longer.It's easy to set up--a card into the DVD unit, the receiver on a shelf near one of the speakers. And, wires, yes wires, from the 2 rear speakers to the receiver.I'm not having the technical difficulties reported by others. If I had it to do over, I'd not spend the $100 for this unit. My rear speakers are only about 10-12 feet from the DVD unit, and the extra wires (one going under an area rug) would not have been that noticeable."
4,My little boy could not contain his laughter,"His chuckles gurgled up from his belly and spilled out across the entire room. ""His underwear! He is in his underwear! Oh, no!!""Usually Sam doesn't like books with so much complex art and so much on a page, but this title definitely made him sit up and take notice. The visuals were engaging and not overwhelming... and they were flat out funny.We got a lot of great stuff to talk about - being scared, embarassed, bad dreams - and the whole time we were enjoying ourselves.This fact alone makes me rave about the title. Its tough to talk about being afraid and being embarassed... and I have the same dreams over and over and over from early years... what a great way to introduce such topics early on and keep communication open between parents and children!All because Marc Brown's readers wanted... underwear.My son and I will take it!"
4,Great Product for Amateurs,"I got the table as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and thought that it was the perfect gift for an amateur player who's looking to start a poker night. It's definitely a nice sturdy table top and it looks better in person than the picture makes it out to be. It's definitely not a ""professional"" table by any means, but it was good enough for our purposes. I would also like to add in response to a previous review that the cup holders are actually quite nice. They are spring loaded so that they fit perfectly into the holes no matter what side the table top is on. All that's necessary is to angle them while placing them into the hole. All and all I'm pretty satisfied."
2,Bad Product,"This product is made very bad. The first one I received was terrible. It was definately damaged at factory. They sent me a replacement after several calls. This one was better, but a bad product. Its made bad. I don't recommend to anyone."
1,Definately not Platinum,"This table top is cheaply constructed. The chip trays fall out when you fold it in half. The one I received had a bump in the middle and would not lay flat. If this is the platinum edition, I would hate to see the lesser models."
2,Flimsy,"When I purchased this top it was supposed to be printed on one side and plain on the other. It was supposed to be sturdy, like a piece of wood. The unit I received is a flimsy cardboard like material. It only has felt on one side (not reversable or usable on the reverse side)"
3,Nothing but treble,"If you're looking for a simple pair of comfortable headphones at a cheap price, these will do for basic listening and to reduce noise pollution around the house. There isn't much bass at all, and the sound quality isn't spectacular, but they are comfortable and have an inline volume control. The cord is only 3 feet long from the volume control to the plug, so I bought an extension cord for $5.99 for easier TV and video game use. If you want exceptional sound, I would go with Sony to start, then decide how much you want to spend. My Sony earbuds I bought for the same price blow these away in sound quality."
3,"""snug"" headphones","While their sound is excellent, these headphones are not very comfortable after wearing them only after a few minutes-they feel like they're mashing against your ears. Would not recommend buying this product"
2,Ok headphones,"The only good thing about these headphones are that it's comfortable. Other than that, it's not that great. Sound is mediocre. I would not recommend this to anyone. There are a lot better headphones out there. Don't waste your money."
3,Much Needed Contribution,"A book like this is greatly needed by the americas, since Europe still believes that she has given everything to us. Unfortunately, the book is too short. A broader, more profound history of produce, products, etc that America has given the world is still needed."
5,What If Tolstoy Had Lived A Century Later?,"He might have written a book like _Life and Fate_. True, Grossman's epic lacks the didactic sections about history that have bemused college students for a century. But in scope of work, depth of characterization, and importance of history discussed, this book is both a conscious homage to, and true successor of, _War and Peace_.Warning: the plot is so absorbing it can make you miss your subway stop. I ended up going from Manhattan to Brooklyn by mistake when I used this as a ""train book."""
5,WWE Armageddon 2008 review,"This is one of the best shows in 2008. The HHH-Edge-Jeff Hardy 3 way bout for the WWE title was a really satisfying main event and had a finish that WWE dared not to for very long time. The John Cena-Y2J match for the World's title while not as good as their bout from one month earlier,it was still a solid match. The eight woman Santa's little helper tag team match was cartoonish and a ""dud"" with Great Khali coming in and making it worse thus making it a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"" but the rest were still great. I give this supercard a 10 out of 10."
2,For beginners,"You will not be wasting your time by reading Developing The Leader Within You. If you are new to the field of leadership, this is a nice introduction. If you are an experienced leader, the book will remind you of some basic principles that you might be neglecting. It does not delve deeply into any one area, and it does not really break new ground. The quotes are selectively footnoted and many of the anecdotes are apocryphal. Maxwell is given to cute turns of phrase that he hopes will be interpreted as words of wisdom (e.g., ""People do not care how much you know until they know how much you care.""). All in all, this is a fine basic introduction, but I was hoping for more. This should not be the only leadership book you read."
4,Good Stuff,"As was stated in a previous reveiw, if you can put this into the perspective of what else was happening in 1964; this is some great stuff. The remastered recording, in spite of when it was originally recorded, is very listenable but it must have been pretty rough before the remaster job. The last song is even in stereo.I own amost everything he did in the first ten years (he had an amazing 12 top 50 albums between 1966-1971). Buying his first was a no-brainer."
4,works well,"I love my lexmark printer and this cartridge works well, but you can get the 23A refilled."
4,I want a new printer,For some reason my printer has decided it no longer likes the color ink cartridge and I am so motivated to purchase a new printer if it were not for the fact that I have little use for it other than rare occasions. But the black ink works fine and lasted a long time.
1,ran out in less than a month,"With minimal use, it ran out in less than a month. Buy these locally, if you need to return"
5,Fit and worked well.,My son said it fit his printer as described and works great. I would recommend this over a cheap refill as we found them problematic and unreliable.
3,Good Product,"Lemark catridge is very expensive compare to HP printer or others, so I suggest people to don't buy Laxmark printer otherwise your pocket will be empty.Temour sayed"
1,Makes a horrible noise!!!,My son had the e100 for a week and it started making an awful noise. Luckily we bought the protection plan. When we took it back and they refunded the money. There was another one there but it had also been returned by the looks of the box. We won't be buying another one.
1,Razor sucks!,"After reading all the problems people have had with Razor's chargers, I can't believe they continue to sell their crappy products. We spent over a hundred bucks on a Razor Electric Scream Machine for my son last year for Christmas. He's ridden it maybe 5 times since then, because the charger fails after a few uses. After tracking someone down at Razor (their customer service sucks as bad as their products), they sent us a new charger. Used it once, then that quit on us. Tried to get our money back, but they said they will only reimburse for taking it to a repair shop. What a pain, what a disappointment, what a waste of money. Don't expect them to stand behind their product. By the way, the Electric Scream Machine is no longer on the market. [...]"
1,ITs BULLshit,ITs a Piece of junk NEVER buy it it goes slower than a todller running! i reapet ITS SHIT
1,this scooter stinks like cheese!,i got this scooter with my money. i am riding and i brake and i stop. then i start going and it is bumpy. i look at the wheel and it broke. i barely pulled on the brake and it flattened the wheel. so it puts more strain on the engine making it go SLOW! this is a waste of money DO NOT BUY IT!
5,This is a PERFECT scooter!!!,"This is a great scooter! I tried it at my friends house, and it was so much fun! We spent 4 hours riding it together! I really want to get one too! It's fast and alot of fun,do not listen to those other reviews. They were probably just too rough on it..."
5,THE ROCKY HORROR Collection Really Rocks!,"THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW Collection contains the ROCKY HORROR movie soundtrack, the soundtrack to the original play, an audience participation CD, a kareokae CD, and a booklet. Perfect for RHPS fans!"
3,A bit overrated,Just found out recently that this is not a studio album but a live one. I finally pulled this out and listend today after aquiring this about two years ago. They play very good live but the songs are subpar in my opinion. It kind of sounds like a bad Sammy Hagar album without the hooks in the songs that I look for. Come on guys 5 stars???!!! It would have been good to see them make a few studio albums because they might have been even better. Schon is very very good playing live guitar like he always is. This cd just isn't up my alley like it is for some Amazon customers.
4,Irusta Poeta con Vision,"En este disco Agustin Irusta muestra su talento como poeta y nos deja ver que el mensaje de sus canciones, como cualquier poesia, nunca tienen tiempo, ni eras, ni modas porque la humanidad siempre va a ser la misma. Me gusta mucho ""Trenzas"", se las recomiendo. El sonido del disco nos remonta a la época dorada de los discos de acetato."
2,Knock offs,These are not really ipod ear phones there cheap knock offs but i mean there 2 bucks so you cant reay complain
3,ok,"ok but lower than the ipods original box headphones ,has a hiss when the people sing and beat to,2 much hiss"
1,"depressing stories, no redeeming qualities","The theme of nearly all of the ""stories"" relvolve about death (someone else's) which leaves the survivor as the victor or sometimes just the survivor. Sounds like bad medicine to me. The smarmy introductions provided by Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen set the scene for real tear jerkers with no moral to the whole sad production. Don't waste your money and postage on this. I'm requesting a refund. Alex Ryan"
4,Eclectic mix - Byrne's the man...,"One main reason for this anthology is, of course, to showcase relatively obscure (in the US at least) artists and encourage sales of their output. Knowing this, I resisted at first, but quickly picked up albums by two of the acts included here: Los Amigos Invisibles (a potent mix of funk, acid, and salsa) and Susana Baca (guitar-accompanied Peruvian vocalist reminiscent of a Spanish-language ""Blue""-period Joni Mitchell). Not every track is of the same quality, but for about $12 this is a great sample of what the rest of this hemisphere has produced in the 90's..."
4,For your Ras Collection,"This is a CD with a bunch of collabs with Ras. If you are already acquainted with Ras then no sweat...pick up this album, if not, you may wanna hold off and pick up his earlier albums and then buy this one. But all in all, this is CD is pretty tight. There is a song with Kool G. Rap that is blaze and then there's one with Talib Kweli, where T.K. comes off. But its worth buying."
5,FAVORITES,"AWESOME MUSIC, VERY RELAXING, LOVE THE ALTERNATIVE SELECTION THAT HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE ME WHO LOVE MUSIC..."
2,Not My Favorite,"Sorry, but all the songs sound alike. One song even sounds like they were trying to copy Madonna. I really did not like the CD. Nothing aganist Lesbians."
5,Perfect for O-Chem,It was useful. Exactly what we needed for O-chem. Pieces come on and off reasonably well. No complaints about it at all.
1,Key Product Info Not Disclosed Online,"I thought I was ordering a variety (spectrum) of solid colored art tissues; however, after receiving said product, it states on the packaging (and not on product description online), ""colors blend when moistened to create exciting artistic effects."" Although I do like tie-dyed effects, I wasn't searching for a product whose color(s) ran/changed when moistened."
1,THIS BOOK IS FRUSTRATING,Iam using this textbook for a college linear algebra class. I have never been more frustrated with a textbook in my life! I am half-way through the semester and i've pretty much resorted to youtube lectures to learn the material. The book is virtually useless to me. Every time I finish a section I try to answer the exercise questions and find that the topics havent been covered in a clear way and I have trouble answering alot of the questions. Not only that but I head to the back of the book to check my answers and often find there arent any solutions. The solutions are few in this textbook. Stay away from this one!
3,MEH,"It was convenient when they were tiny babies, but by the time they started moving around they broke it pretty quickly. They weren't even 2 years old. Not very well made imo."
1,worth about a quarter,"I ordered this book knowing I wasnt going to get anything spectacular because it was cheap, but I figured it would actually have activities in it, because of the title. It's nothing more than 21 animated looking stickers with a small land scene on the inside front and back covers. They call it a panoramic scene to place the stickers on. The scene measures less than 6 inches high and 8 inches long. This book is worth no more than 25 cents."
2,I've seen better,"some of the info in this book is untrue...Color of a Shepherd DOESN'T EFFECT A DOG'S BEHAVIOR, for Example Black Shepherds are calmer and white Shepherds are Hyper. Any Shepherd can be hyper, my Sable Shepherd was hyper up til he died 12-12-06 at 7 months old. So COLOR has NOTHING to do with a dog's Temperament or Behavior"
2,This book is not written very well,"Trying to follow the steps in the book turned out to be a bigger challenge than advertised. For example, as I write this article, I haven't been able to figure out the muddy steps for unlocking headers and footers from each other. Something that should be rudimentary and obvious. The instructions are not complete, and I've already invested over two hours of time, cursing both Aaron and Microsoft. Why, after paying for this book, should I have to google or search elsewhere for additional help?I'd give anything - ANYTHING - for an intuitive program or a manual that lives up to its claims."
1,China Junk,"What a piece of crap, This thing loses signal constantly.Very annoying, Feel like ripping it off my bike and throwing it against a wall. I'll never buy Sigma again"
1,OVERPRICED and UNDERVALUED,"this particular model only gives you the sony name and nothing more for the value. they don't offer the new 2005 upgrade and the tv tuner doesn't even have the built-in fm tuner like hp/gateway. 4 months with the vgc-ra710g; it gave up and won't start-up... they had to send somebody to fix it (which was good). i might have been the <10% of the unlucky customer who gets the defective one. just hope it doesn't break again after the warranty. warning: don't be taken by the cool looks of the case. you will still hear the ""quiet"" pc when it's idling; more like a regular overpriced computer with a ""cool"" looking cooling system and case."
4,Give it a chance!,"OK; so far the reaction to this seems to be love or loathe. If you're a true music fan, you will at least give it a chance. ""Champagne?"" is one of the most innovative mixes of genres I've heard in a long time. ""Slow and Easy"" is a haunting slip into Satriani's blue dream. Try downloading some samples of others. Some may say it sounds like video game music. For me, it's like great driving music: Play the disc and cruise baby!"
4,Satch gone techno?,"When I first listened to this CD I thought that ol' Satch had finally gone off his rocker, but after listening to it all the way through a few times it grew on me. The combination of the techno beats and Satch's guitar riffs works quite nicely. Some of the melodies and lead work remind me of Crystal Planet, but the techno beats add a new dimension to it. Over all I have to say that I like this CD. Buy it!"
5,Engines of Creation,It's the best instrumental music I have ever listened.i like the all albumits realy amazing
3,"Almost, but not quite.",I like the dirction that Joe is going with this quasi-techo album but I feel that the songwriting suffered. If he payed more attention to the feeling of the songs and tried to evoke more emotions rather than just come up with cool sounds this record might have surpassed the awesome Crystal Planet. Keep at it Joe.
4,"great watch, real diamonds","bought this watch for my mom for mother's and she loved it. The diamonds surrounding the face are tiny but they shine. the only downside of this watch is that its only 3 bar water resistant which means that it's only resistant to ""accidental splashes"". other than that its great that she will never have to change the battery because of the eco-drive feature. it also keeps great time."
1,Why did BJ permit this?,"Sai Li's comments are right on target. Just listen to the samples and you will not wish to go here. I disagree that the problem is the absence of the words; the problem here is a pianist who, unlike the ""Piano Man"" in that LA Bar who rose to honest stardom, should have stayed there. This artist lacks the depth of Joel but owes him a great favor in Joel's permission to release this album. Why, BJ, Why?"
4,A Review from the St. John's Haunted Hike,"First of all, I must admit that I am a bit biased in this review, as I was fortunate enough to be a contributor of the stories for the Newfoundland Canada section of the book. Having said that, I do feel that this is a very useful, well laid out and presented guide to hauntings from around the world. Some of the reports could do with more detail, but the strength of this book is in its attempt to have an incredibly wide variety of accounts from all over the world. I would definately recommend it to those interested in ghost stories, and as well to the armchair traveller!"
5,Great detail and rugged construction make for a great toy.,"I bought this with the adult saber-toothed tiger for my niece, who loves anything prehistoric, and she plays with them both constantly. The detail and quality are terrific. You may want to buy additional animals in this series, like the woolly mammoth and baby, to enhance interest and enjoyment. A great buy for anyone who loves prehistoric life."
1,Written for 8 year olds.,"The movie targeted a very young crowd, as did the book. Just as presumptuous and boring as any other T. Brooks novels."
2,"Unless you want a verbatim rehash of the movie, don't bother","Most novels suffer when they are made into movies, simply because a good novel usually has a lot more characters, dialogue, scenes, action, and description than will fit into a two-hour movie. Think of Dune, for example. Sad to say, if Lucas had taken Brooks' novel as the basis for the Phantom Menace, instead of the other way around, next to nothing would have been lost. Aside from a couple of short scenes involving Anakin, the book was nearly identical to the movie. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love the book. Brooks does a decent job of translating the script into a narrative. But if you're looking for background material and insight into the characters' histories and motivations, read Queen Amidala's Journal by Jude Watson."
3,"Interesting perspectives, but boring writing!","I enjoyed the movie and was really looking forward to reading the book after all the good reviews it got. Although it was interesting to get a perspective of the inner thoughts of the characters (which, I believe were pretty close to Lucas' intent), I found the author's use of prose to be very distracting. Several times during each chapter, the author uses the term ""wheeled"" or ""wheeling"" to describe a character ""turning around"" or ""leaving the room."" Toward the end of the book, his descriptions of the action got very tedious."
5,"Wonderful book, worthy of the film! (that's something!)","This book captures the feel of the movie completely. Even if you have already seen the movie, you should read this book, because it adds to the movie experience, as well as being masterful on itself!"
3,It's tough to create a book out of any screenplay..,"Some other posts argue the merits of whether the book is better than the movie, etc. For book adaptations of screenplays, like this case, that question is moot. This book is simply a more user friendly, take-it-with-you copy of the movie storyline. I've read Brooks' work before and it's very good. Unfortunately, it's hard to properly flesh out this script in a book without some major additions. The book, faithfully following the script, is clearly written for children. This is unfortunate as the original Star Wars didn't get to where it is today by appealing to the ten year old set."
3,Offers Almost Nothing New,"I thought I'd gain a little more insight than the movie offered, like how much I gained from reading Episodes 2 and 3 books. I guess there was a little more to the story...some expanded dialogues between characters, a few extended 'scenes', and so on, but not nearly enough. This book followed the movie very closely, and reading Jar Jar talk is just as bad as listening to him in the movie. What Lucas was thinking when he made the Gungans is beyond me. I'd say this really isn't worth your time reading unless you are the type that reads EVERY Star Wars book written."
2,I could have just read the script.,"Seriously, I felt like I was reading a script with a cover. And I think many would acknowledge that the Star Wars movies aren't exactly known for their incredible writing. They're enjoyable movies, granted, but not because of the writing.I might have given it another star out of kindness, except that for the rest of my life I'll have to contend with nightmares of *reading* Jar-Jar's annoying dialogue. If you think it was annoying in the movie... <Shudder.>"
1,"Great story, but lacking in Star Wars detail.","I thought the story was great, but the it didn't go into much detail like the first trilogy books. I think the problem is that George Lucas didn't write the book. Terry Brooks is a great writer, but couldn't go into much detail because of the movie. There are somethings he couldn't expand on because he didn't know what Lucas was thinking. If Lucas actually sat down and wrote the book himself or Terry the book would have surely got a 5 star rating. I think this is going to be one of the rare times where the movie is better then the book."
2,Only for the Star Wars faithful,"If you live and die Obi-Wan, Anakin and the rest of the characters of the Star Wars saga, you certainly saw The Phantom Menace. This book is based on Lucas' screenplay, thus is very true to the story you saw on screen, down to the dialogue. In that way, this book is mostly dull and uninteresting. However, it does include many details about the relationship between characters such as Anakin and Padme, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gonn Jinn which you do not see in the film. There are a small handful of""~ 'scenes' that were not present in the film, but so few and far between that it is not worth reading the whole boring book just for those parts. This is one of those rare times where the book is NOT better than the movie. right now, I suggest letting the film speak for itself."
1,Toooo advanced for me!,I thought I was a good stepper until I tried this video!! It was too difficult for me to follow.
2,"No cueing, will take a while to learn the routines","I have been doing step aerobics for 20 years, videos for about 8 years: Cathe, Kari Anderson, Chrisi Taylor and others. This is my first Amy Bento DVD. There is NO cuing in this dvd and no attempt to introduce or layer the complex choreography. She introduces the step as she is doing it. Many of the moves are done in front of the step, facing the step, so your back is to the TV, so you can't see what she is doing... I watched this video twice before attempting the first 3 segments, and still was only able to do 50% of the routine-with constant rewinding. I am going to try to learn the workout, and give Amy a chance, but probably will not buy any more of her DVDs. It is simply too frustrating."
4,Great Rock!,I have enjoyed this band since early 2000. They can really get heavy and then have a couple slow tunes. Mr. Wiggly was the song that hooked me when I first heard it. It's an angry song and great for driving in rush hour traffic. I wish they were still around...
3,rocks with memory,"This cd was one of a few that ""soundtracked"" my year of 2000. Great rock....not bad, and now too bad we never got more ..."
1,So - how DO things work?,The book doesn't actually get around to telling you how things work. Thank goodness Amazon has a liberal return policy. This book was useless to me.
1,Not a fan,"We ordered one, it didn't work well. It seemed great, but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind. based on all the reviews, we thought we must have had a defective one. We ordered a replacement, but it seems to have the same issues. Very disappointed."
3,"Not bad, but not five stars either.","First, the pluses: great speakerphone, great voice dialing, nice two-way hinge, connects to my bluetooth headset easy as pie.Minuses include: teeny, tiny, ridiculously small buttons that a person with large hands will find frustrating to use. Music sounds tinny on the speakers, no universal headphone jack.I've had this phone for nine months and dropped it countless times. It is durable, but the small buttons are a pain in my patoot. I think I might have been better served with an Envy."
4,Comcasted Aren't We All?,"I just read this book because I was mad at Comcast--long story. While I didn't find it brimming with ""dirt"" I did find it a quick, interesting read and gave me some of the answers to my questions--why this giant has not been felled by the government...it's all in the message. The Robertses are very clever about how their media messages are presented and swallowed. If you're looking for a pure rant, you won't find satisfaction in this book. If you're looking for a sublimely damning look inside the company that pretty much controls how we watch tv and how much we pay for it, you'll enjoy this book."
3,Works well.,This product works as described. I use it on a laptop to communicate through ActiveSync to my Dell Pocket PC. I've had no issues using it.
3,USB Irda Adapter,"The Adapter is fine, and the price is terrific. The instructions, however, are not good. They are unclear, difficult to understand, and the illustrations don't always match what comes with the included software."
1,Connecting to Polar HRM - Problems,"I bought this because of other posts that it worked with the Polar heart rate monitors for downloading data. It might, but I can't get my unit to synch with my Polar S725x. I tried it on a Dell Latitude laptop and on a Dell 8300 desktop with no success. The Dell diagnostic on both machines says the device is working fine, but when synching, I should get an icon in the taskbar, and don't. I do get a blinking ""COM"" message on the Polar which should indicate it sees the IRDA device. I am now thinking that I might have a defective unit that appears to be working OK to the Dells. One note: Polar sent a message that the speed should be set to 9600 baud and the min. turn around time to 10 ms (settings, control panel, wireless link, hardware, advanced). It didn't help. Whatever. I'm going to try another unit."
1,Never Again,"They drive by night was one of the first noirs I watched as a child, naturually making it a must have. I owned it before in a slim case but it was lost and also part of a box set that I already own the feature titles. I dont know why but warner has been selling their 4 sets with the dvds stacked together. I HATE this deception but to recieve it from TCM? Buyer beware, if you like your disc stacked...fine! Myself, well I think it is cheap and deceptive. I purchased many Universal 4 packs and the disc are in individual holders. I give this 1 star simply for the dvd quality of the movies, but 0 for the packaging! These disc end up in cd cases were IM not able to display them. Not to mention stacked disc get scratched easily.....Shame on you TCM/WARNER!"
4,In the Year of Jubilee,"I have always liked this book, and since I had lost my copy, was very to find it again. Having re-read the book, I remember why I liked it, and think others will too."
4,A Jazz Neohpyte Discovers The Crusaders,"When I found this album in a drawer at my parents' house, I had to have it. The Crusaders had me at the first track, and they had me for good with the second. Although the Crusaders moved eventually into more R&B circles, they will always remain part of Jazz in my mind. The Crusaders are in top form in '68, and the audience at the Lighthouse Club is an extremely responsive one, which makes for a fun live album. ""Ooga-Boo-Ga-Loo"" really bops, and the Jazz interpretation of ""Eleanor Rigby"" is a lot mellower (and frankly more fun) than the Beatles' original. The ""Native Dancer"" track is an interesting one too--it feels like a cross between belly-dancing and Native American tribal dance. Kinda cool. One more thing about the Crusaders: their pianist absolutely rocks in this album. They're wonderful and flawless live performers. Take it from the Neohpyte: buy this album."
2,Uneven,"Captain William Markham is a tragic hero. Captured by Robert Barrons and falsely acused and convicted of being a traitor, Captain Markham is hung for his crimes and finds his way to a strange light, after his death.Lady Arianna Halverson ""sees dead people."" From a gift inherited through her mother, Lady Arianna is able to counsel recently dead people in order to allow them to cross over the other side. After dinner with her brother, she first meets Captain Markham, who needs her help in enacting his vengence.This book was very uneven and very much a first effort by the author. The story really did not flow at all, from the moment Lady Arianna is ""forced"" to marry to the big fight scene towards the end. As each aspect of the plot is revealed, it is obvious that it has something to do with Captain Markham. Honestly, this book could have and should have been MUCH better. I'm not sure if Ms. Labud will last past her first effort, if she does not improve her writing greatly."
3,Heidegger's Plato's Sophist,"If you want to read this book you do need to have an extensive knowledge of the Greek language. If you can't read Greek, don't buy this book! If you can, it is a very interesting lecture course (1924-1925) and interpretive essay by Heidegger. Leiden, Holland"
3,Out of Date,"This is a good manual, but it suffers from one important defect. It was written before Office for Mac 2004 was released and it is a little out of date. It does not cover the new features in the programs and it discusses ways to do things the programs are supposed to do that they do not do anymore.I looked for something as comprehensive that was post 2004 and could not find it, so this is probably the best you can do, which is better than nothing."
5,Great Modern Reference for the Scientist/Engineer,"I have some of the best physics/engineering texts in my library. This one is one of my favorites. An incredible resource for the modern scientists or engineer. If any book on Amazon deserves 5 stars, it is this book. (Although, there are a few minor errors regarding units but no biggie. This should absolutely NOT dissuade you from getting this book)Thank you for putting all this great lab information together!!!!"
4,light and soft,"This is a nice, light set. It is a pretty color and is very warm at night. Its a good winter blanket, or if you keep the thermostat at 68 at night like my husband, it keeps you warm. It doesn't feel like down, it feels like the padding or foam that cheap blankets are filled with. Its a little crunchy too. Overall, however, I'm pleased."
2,2000 yr old man,Not as good as the original. Still funny but extra foul language takes away from the humor. A bit dissapointing.
3,It gets the job done...,"The dresser was ok, it gets the job done, but it's made out of cheap wood. What more can you expect. It's fine though and looks great"
3,Forget something?,"Would have been REALLLLLLYYYYYY nice to have received assembly instructions for the item i waited 10 days for. How the company was able to manage the 300 bolts, screws, nuts, and nails but completely bypass putting in the instructions is beyond me. Not to mention, it says QUICK & EASY assembly....ha! Quick & easy means less than an hour and even an idiot could do it....funny how every review i've read (from the people who actually GOT their instructions) said it took them 2 hours and 2 people. Anywho....I now have to call and request my instructions, wait the 2-3 days for them to arrive, and it will be THEN that I will actually be able to put this d@mn thing together to see how it looks! Goody!"
4,baddddd shipping,well when it got here some of it was broke and i order new parts but everything came out greatt
1,Poor Product,"I ordered a set of these dressers, so I spent about $500.00 on this cheap stuff. I was very disappointed in the cheap quality of the dresser sets. I have a lot of clothes, so of course the bottoms fell out and the back came off. I had to go and purchase craft glue and extra small nails to seal it so that the bottoms would stop falling out. I wish I can break it down and send it back and get a full refund. Not pleased at all with product. However the dark wood color is the only thing I like about it. Other then that, please don't buy it. I do not recommend it."
5,"Inspirational, Life Changing Fitness Book for Any Age","What an awesome, inspirational life coaching book! Mr. Pierron shares his wisdom for fitness through encouraging quotes, stories and his own personal journey. It will inspire and educate anyone, at any age to live a healthier life."
4,Easy to read and understand,"Fit Happens...at Any Age is an easy to read and easy to understand book. Many of the chapters are short and sweet, highlighting key points, others more pithy. The author touches on many topics in this fast-paced book, and speaks with credibilty and knowledge as he is a former body-building champ. If you want to be fit, and you need inspiration to ""Dream Big"", buy this book!"
2,Nice Source Bad book,"The source for this book is for an entry level 3D engine, which is just what I wanted. But a lot of the theory (coll det etc) in the source is not explained in the book. Rather than explaining fundamental aspects they seem to throw in loads of detail about the topics that they dont seem to have covered and taken for lots of articles that you can find on the web (gamasutra for one).Saying that the source is nice and taught me a lot, bsp trees + a bit about collisions. Im glad I have the source but the book seems thrown together and shabby. I just think they could have done a better job making it readable starting 3D engine book rather than a shabby reference book."
2,This ones nothing to brag about...,"... I agree with some of the previous negative reviews. I find the flow of the text unpleasant and the book lacked an introduction - where's the pedagogy? It seems as if someone with competence in the field but without alot of forethought just sat down and wrote it, and Addison Wesley didn't bother to have an editor help out in any way. Anyway, this book is in line with the rest of Addison-Wesley's books. Half of the courses that I take require textbooks from Addison Wesley. The courses are always difficult thanks to these second rate books. I recommend Wiley above all publishers but stay away from Addison Wesley if you can. They just dont seem to give a smack about the quality."
3,Good but fairly predictable,I enjoyed it while I read it but found it fairly predictable and unfortunately fairly forgettable when done. Not sure if I would read it again but I did find it good value for money.I am in the process of reading the whole Cynster series which I am enjoying but felt this one was a weaker story which was a shame as I had enjoyed these two characters in previous books.
1,The worst book I've read in a long time,"Generally, I am a fan of romance novels. I like the fact that 99.9% of the time there is a happy ending where the main characters live happily ever after. However, I like the space between the first page and the happily ever after to have some conflict, character development, and plot. This book contains none of these. As far as I can tell, the ""story"" is a excuse for the Author, whom I've read and enjoyed many times before, to illustrate how many different sexual acts she can describe in flowery detail. If you buy historical romances for the sex scenes buy this book. If not, don't bother."
3,Not the best,"I had never read any of Stephanie Laurens books until I happened upon the Cynster stories. I totally fell in love with the Cynster's. This book was a disappointment, since none of the Cynster males but Simon where involved. The strong Cynster males with their devotion to family, but there determination to deny love is what made the series. While I still liked the book, I do not see how it is even close to drawing you into the essence of what the Cynster males where or how strong the females had to be to draw this type of male."
2,Weak Plot.....,Seemed like the plot was just an excuse to string together a series of sex scenes. Not Ms. Laurens best effort. Wait until it comes out in paperback.
3,Imperfect writing,I could have liked this book more.Perhaps if Ms. Laurens had curbed her love of one-sentence paragraphs.They're used for emphasis.And they can be very effective.At least when used sparingly.Which is not how they're used here.Pity.
4,Dgib,I am a ole school hip hop head! The CD was very clear and kept. The sounds of Word of Mouth is an oldie and is definitely hard to find. That was the only reason why I purchased this CD. Thank you very much.
2,Not what I thought.,"The maps on this remanufactured GPS were so old, it was useless without an update."
3,RoadMate 700,The road mate works great for getting from point a to b. Along with that is some glitches that may freeze the system. I you can get over that you will have a good system.
4,Picture is Misleading,"I bought this adapter in hopes to use my PC speakers with my PS2 console. The adapter works perfectly, not sound glitches, or any abnormalities.However, I want to point out that the product pictured on Amazon.com is misleading, the adapter I recieved is a just a single wire, not a box adapter like the one picture ^ up there.But if that doesn't bother you this is a great adapter for your X-Box/PS2/Gamecube if you want to use PC Speakers for audio."
3,Inconvenient light show,"I wasn't pleased, I actually returned it to the store. Its bulky, you have to wind it for it to work, and it only plays for about five minutes. If you don't mind those factors then this is the light show for you. Other light shows you just push a button and it plays for 15 minutes!"
5,Great Product,this nightlight is wonderfull. at first we worried that you had to wind it up to get it to play. but we relized that was what was so great about it. you just sit it down and it will turn its self off after about 10 min or so. our 3 triplets cant sleep without it.
4,Good but overpriced,"First I would like to say that I am not an expert on speakers. I am just someone who loves listening to all kinds of music.The SoundDock from Bose actually delivers pretty good sound for its size. I like listening to music at high (but not extremelly high) volumes, and it performs quite well. Once in a while I do hear some distortion. But anyway, it handles bedrooms and small rooms easily. For larger spaces it lacks the punch delivered by larger speakers and subwoofers.If size is not crucial for you, you are probably better off with cheaper but larger speakers.I am satisfied with my purchase. If it costed a little less (200-249) I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Love the size and sound!!,"Received this speaker system as a early birthday gift yesterday. I've always wanted a Bose Acoustic Wave Radio or a small Wave clock radio but I can't get myself to shell out a few hundred bucks for them. I have been using speakers from Boston Acoustics at home on my computer system. Anyway, so far, I am impressed with the sound, size, ease of use and the tiny remote control. I'm planning to bring my 3rd generation IPOD and these speakers to a cabin for a vacation next week and have a party! And it it small enough to pack it (with enought protection) in your luggage or carry on for out-of-town trips. And for the fact that it will also ""charge"" your ipod is handy. No need to bring your charger. I have quite a few ""pros"" however one ""con"" though, is the price of $299.00 (paying for the Bose name, I suppose). If I had to pay for this myself, I would probably have to think hard, hahaha...."
2,Bose Ipod Speakers,"I'm so disgusted with Bose right now! I recently ordered this SoundDock System and a several days later received an e-mail from Amazon saying they were refunding my money because they couldn't get information on my order from Bose.What a great marketing scheme.Actually, I'm happier now because I bought a set of Creative Technology Speakers and they sound quite good for $185.00 less.I've never been a Bose fan and I will continue that feeling."
2,Close but definetely no cigar.,This could have been a great unit but as usual there is NO control over the BASS and TREBLE. The less than brilliant Bose engineers think they should have total control over the sound of YOUR music. Maybe someday they will wise up but I doubt it. I returned the unit after 2 days. For an AWESOME set of dedicated IPOD speakers you should get the Altec Lansing new InMotion iM7. It's the best!
3,Excellent sound - God forsaken power connection,The Bose SoundDock will give you excellent sound and very handy remote. The power connection is just plain awful. There are four little pins that connect the power supply to the back of the SoundDock - Be Extreemly Careful and do not break any one of them!!! Our SoundDock is in the trash this morning. :-(
3,Overpriced,"Sound is OK, but my 10 year old philips legend II speakers on the stereo are better, and @ US$300+ I expected betterthumbs up for design: compact and easy to set up, shame about the 70s style color. reminds me of these old 70's wardrobethe remote is handy.would not buy again"
2,Tango not for dancing,"Charlo has a nice enough voice but the orchestrations follow the voice too much. None of the songshave a consistent beat that would be acceptable in a milonga. In addition to the regular orquesta tipicainstruments are oboe and flute; violins are featured and the bandoneon takes a backseat. Charlo sings, whistles, phrases well and has a nice vibrato, but there are better voices in tango that inspire dancers and listeners."
3,Motorola IHF1000 Bluetooth Car Kit,"Very nice product, makes it very easy to place and receive calls; however, my unit received did have some strange quirks. The call announce feature would announce the last call received instead of the current call incoming. Some voice menu items did not function properly. Overall, the main features that are necessary for functionality worked excellent."
4,Better than Average,"This is the first of Hendricks' books that I have read. I enjoyed the story line. Some of her descriptions made me read them twice as they were a little over the top. For instance: "" Friday night there's a waxing moon, and when I first see it rising up over the hills to hang like a silver apostrophe in the pale blue twilight, I know right away what I have to do."" This is a relaxing book to read and I may try another of her books. I am in a book club and this was not on the list. Many of our books are more difficult reads and the subjects depressing. If you want an enjoyable and light read I would recommend this."
3,Used Keyboard,"It was a used keyboard, a bit bent up, the mouting needed to be modified slightly to fit, but at least it worked."
1,Can't hear my singing over music,"I was soo happy to get this, but we had to return it, because you have to turn the volume up so loud that you can't hear my voice, even with the MIC turned all the way up. It would have been so cool to have, it has a TV and DVD player to watch movies, but even the movies would freeze up once in a while. It made me sad to have to take it back and I hope we can find another one like it. I thought mine was defective and tried to exchange it but they ran out of new ones. Now I see a lot of people must have the same problem."
1,Karaoke you can't hear,Agree completely with the prior review. Even at maximum microphone volume you can not hear the karaoke vocals. Pretty much defeats the purpose of a karaoke machine. Mine is going back.
5,Super Structures of the World: Kansai International Airport,I am a very big fan of just about anything dealing with this and other related subjects and I can tell u i enjoyed watching this hour long video on one of the worlds most magnificent airports. The detail that they go into on its construction is great and with all the areial shots of the airport and the airlinse that use it it makes me want to sit and watch it over every time. I hope someday to visit not so much as to visit the city of Osaka but just to see this marvel.
4,Yummy...DB in Lingerie!,"Silly movie, basically no plot, best interaction is Alan Cummings and DB, have watched it numerous times and never get tired of it regardless of no plot."
4,Good cheesy,"I realize that a lot of people think this show is a little hard to grasp, but I found it refreshing. It is a little dated, but shows a lot about the 80's and is always filmed in beautiful locations. Pretty funny and usually a good plot without being too serious."
2,overheated,"If you're a Clint Walker fan - on IMdB, it was listed that Clint'sepisode, ""The Last of the Magnificent"" (how appropriate for him) wassupposed to be on Season 3, episode 13. Well, it isn't. It's appar-ently on Season 2 (but I'm still waiting for my exchange)."
4,Maine Coast intrigue,"I read Steal Away while on vacation which was fortunate as I had a hard time putting it down! Trying to piece together the clues kept me wanting to ""steal away"" from vacation activities to read some more! It was interesting to read about Ellen's escape from a very real and entitled life and how that was accomplished over so many years! As a native New Englander, it was interesting to read the author's description of the Maine coast as it conjured vivid images of the setting of the story."
2,Not A Great Deal...,"This movie eight pack came up when I entered the name of a movie I was looking for. The description line seemed to indicate my movie was part of the pack. It wasn't. I kept the pack anyway, as some of the titles were good. None of the movies played all the way through, and one won't even load. Poor description, poor quality."
4,Comprehensive Introduction to the Alphabet,"""Richard Scarry's Best ABC Video Ever"" was a nice follow-up to ""Richard Scarry's Best Learning Songs Video Ever"" for my son, who is now 16 months old. He began watching the latter video when he was 12 months old. I thought that that was a nice umbrella (overall introduction) for the various subtopics, including the alphabet. ""Richard Scarry's Best ABC Video Ever"" is lively, and creative. It thoroughly engages my son, and captures his complete attention. The characters are familiar and friendly. More importantly, it further stretches the idea of a community. I highly recommend the video. I plan to purchase all of the items in the series."
3,Another early solid volume,"This book of poetry is graced with line drawings of plant life that complement the texts. The poems in this volume reflect a mind under stress slowly reaching independence. In the title poem, the narrator of the poem identifies herself as ""crop-headed woman"", ""bird-boned hitchhiker"", ""mountain girl recluse"", ""minstrel poet"". These persona, together with their younger self, reflect the range within which the poetry roams - depending heavily on mythic images, condensed language, and a solid sense of verbal rhythm."
4,My 3 year old loves it,It's cute and only mildly annoying (for an adult). My 3 year old loved Hello Kitty and loves this video too! We can now stop borrowing it from the library!
5,The essence of cool,"I was just a kid during the time that Peter Gunn aired on television, wishing that I could be as cool as Pete when I grew up. And now fifty years have slipped by and although I never achieved his level of cool, I have fond memories of the show and still love this great music. Hank Mancini not only captured the spirit of the times in his melodies and orchestrations, he also connected parts of the music to the characters. When I listen to Dreamsville I immediately think of Edie, Pete's knockout girlfriend who sings at Mothers. If you were lucky enough to have seen the show during that era you'll know that this style of jazz combo music was the last of its kind and was evolving into the Beatnik style of coffee house jazz that became popular later in the sixties. Thanks to all responsible for giving us this great CD."
4,More than just tennis,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is much more to this book than tennis. Drucker's biographical information about Connors is fascinating; even as a tennis fan I really knew very little about him and mostly had only heard of his late career heroics at the U.S. Open.What I really enjoyed about this book was Drucker's personal story. Although he wasn't directly involved in the professional tennis world (until later on) his book shows that professional sports, and more than that, idols in general, can directly effect our personal lives. As the title indicates, Jimmy Connors impacted Joel Druckers' life in a very real way. As much as I loved the tennis side of the book, the personal interest slant is what kept me reading.This book is worth your reading time. Thanks Joel Drucker!"
2,"Same Old, Same Old","OK, what can I say? The prologue introduced a firey scene that I hoped would carry through to the main book but I was wrong. I have read this in any number of JAK's other books. Same kind of heroine and hero. Different setting. I thought the character of Victoria Bellamy was of much more depth and complexity that the main characters. I think JAK would have better served her reading fans by making her the storyline and putting Jack and Elizabeth in the back ground. I'm not sure what seems to be the problem with JAK's latest book(s) but something is surely missing. Its like the aim is good but it veers off during the journey. I would hate to see JAK's talent rest on its laurels. Be daring, be bold and surprise the heck out of us, Jayne."
2,Next Book Please,"Soft Focus was not JAK's best effort to date. I have read nearly all her works, relentlessly backtracking out of print editions. I Love her ablity to weave a mystery that all the clues are there, but leaves you guessing until the end. This did not happen in Soft Focus. The ending was a suprise only because it was unsupported. The charatures decissions to have a romantic relationship was very sloppy. And what about commitment? Sex without commitment is both supid and boring in a plot line. I await her next book with higher expectations!"
1,Soft Focus,I was very disappointed in this book. I love JAK whether she writes as herself or as Jayne Castle or Amanda Quick. I could hardly stay interested in the story. The plot never developed into anything. I did not care for the characters either as there did not seem to be any romance or chemistry between them. Normally I cannot put down a JAK book. It was unheard of that this book took me one week to finish. Normally a good JAK is finished in one day to the exclusion of everything else! I am disappointed that I bought the hardcover edition. The last three of her books have also been disappointing. The characters are not developed and the story limps along. Truly disappointing.
3,A staind white radiance,The book was as described. It was a library book from Orange County. It has usual wear and tear. I got it quickly.
1,Not much good,This product was very late being delivered and then when I opened it there were no tapes in the box. I got ripped off on this one. Will never order from this seller again.
4,a stained white radiance,"excellent book, typical James Lee Burke, never disappointed. looking forward to the next book in line. exactly what i expected."
1,"Good publicity, not that good music","Naulo's music is not really naulo. Their 'experimentation' with this album has yielded average type of songs. Yes, the lyrics are really not tasteful. After listening to several new Nepali albums, Nepathya and Navin Bhattarai are two that have given new meaning to the new generation Nepali music. I give two thumbs down to Sapani Ma and expect better music from Naulo in future release."
3,Too basic for me,"I've been investing for many years but only began investing in arbitrage situations over the past year. I found this book much too basic based on the knowledge I've already gained just by reading various tender offers, proxies and so on. Over 100 pages of the book is two reprints, one of a tender offer document and the other of a court case decision, with a few observations thrown in throughout the reprints. If you have no arbitrage experience it may helpful."
4,Great value buy!,I can feel the difference within the first week. It may seem tough to practice initially but with practice you can get the benefits.
5,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product. The grips arecomfortable, and the wheel moves smoothly.Buy this wheel, and you wont be disappointed."
5,Good Shower present,"The title may be intimidating to some of you. But this book is highly recommended for EVERY parent. Every kid is a little ""goofy"" at times, sometimes amazingly so. This book explains how and why kids act ""goofy""."
3,"Confusing to operate, and they break","I got six of these, 11 years ago. Replaced two broken ones a few years ago, and a third one broke soon afterward. (It's not entirely broken, can still activate the ""rocker switch"" if you push on it just the right way). Maybe the current models are built better, but they appear to operate in the same confusing way. I'm the only one in my family who fully understands how to use them. And forget about the cleaning service...one of their prime directives is to turn off all lights when they leave, and they manage to turn them off completely (vs. dimming to the minimum) only some of the time. For a while they were turning them off using the ""air gap"" (mechanical shutoff), until I taped that over. All in all, dimming from multiple locations is cool, but these aren't worth the trouble."
2,Doesn't work with LED bulbs,Purchased 7 of these for my new house (all dimmable LED bulbs). The dimmer looks great and have a good feel to it. But the problem is it doesn't work with LED bulbs. Too bad the product description didn't mention this.Now I have to rip out the 7 switches I put in and return them.
3,Does what its supposed to,"Nice product. Doesn't get full stars because you cant set a permanent light level, it only remembers the last setting. Also, VERY awkward in my guest bathroom as guests can't figure out to push rather than flip a switch. Maybe that says says something about my guests ;)the gradual on and off dimming is very nice"
4,Another great piece of dimmer design.,"It might take someone slow (like me) to figure out how to 'set' this dimmer, but if you have two settings that you usually use (off and medium) one touch of the button elegantly dims the light to the pre-selected level.The effect was so nice when I saw it at my brother-in-law's that I had to get one (and will probably get more) for different rooms!"

4,Very thin,"My only complaint about this roll is that it is not Heavy weight at all! It is very thin but it works for what I bought for (finger paints and coloring), so i am giving it 4 stars."
5,Pleased.,"This is cheap entertainment. I use it to cover our 48"" round table for coloring. My 2 year old loves to color the whole table. If I use both sides of the paper, it'd cost about 25 cents a time, and it entertains her for at least a couple hours. Can't beat that with a stick! The paper is nice and thick and I'm sure I'll use it for other things such as wrapping paper. Shipping was fast too."
4,Great for posters,got this to help do posters for a friends b-day. great quality and way cheaper than buy indiviual sheets of poster board.
3,Mostly just okay,"Most of the songs were ""cartoons"". My small Grandson likes puppets singing better so wasn't a big hit with him."
2,Outdated,"A very disappointing video. One or two good songs but the rest are so outdated you will laugh. The images of little kids dressed in 70s apparal alone is enough for this to be redone. Considering it came out in 1994, this looks like a rush to video production rather than a well planned one like is usually the case from these folks. Avoid it."
2,Book is marked all over WITH BLACK PEN!,"The book had markings all over with black permanent pen. I was hopping to use this to study but now I will have to buy another book that has no markings so I can use it. Sorry seller, I wish you would had used a pencil instead of a black pen to answer all the problems.I dont know who in the world still uses a black pen to work organic chemistry problems! I think they teach you in middle school not to use pen on sciece classes!Anyway, that was my two cents."
3,NOT $18 off website,"it is actually 21 dollars plus 6 for shipping, true you do still save money, but you have to print an order form off the website and fax it back. I dont have a fax machine and i dont want to mail an order form so it depends if all that time is worth an extra 8 $."
3,ACS Organic Review Manual,"Manual is excellent for preparing you for the ACS part of your organic final. However, the ""like new"" item that I received was hardly that. The material can be quickly reviewed and there are a few end of section questions to reinforce the material and it shouldn't detract from your normal textbook studies so you can do both if you're not too pressed for time. I definitely recommend you getting this manual just be careful on who you get it from."
2,"This book is a good review, at best..","I recently took the acs organic national final (fall 09). I used this book only to prepare for my exam, due to the time constraints of my other finals. Just for your info I am a good organic student, making an A in organic 1 and having an A in organic 2 before the final at a very highly honored Chemistry institute (Marshall University). With that said this book isn't really worth the money unless your scenario fits mine, not enough time and don't know what else to look at. I had to make above a 35/70 for an A and I barely did that. The book is a general overview of the concepts on the test but the test itself is very complex. There was many things on the test I hadn't ever seen before (reactions and reagents). I wish you all good luck and in my opinion the book isn't worth it unless you have no other reliable options."
2,Sins of the flesh?,"Schiller's conceit here is misguided. The mirror references are tired, and Hansen's overbearing father is a cliche rather than a character. While distilling Hansen's motives proves interesting at times, the dialouge reads as the male equivalent of a boddice ripper, though Lifetime TV would love it."
3,My Personal Perspective,"I was interested in the story about this man, but I really could do without all the sexual nonsense. This destroyed the book for me. If I were the wife of this gentleman, I would be aghast that my personal life had been exposed. Maybe this was okayed by her, but I didn't need to read all this garbage to get the story. It's too bad if we fear our book won't sell unless we tell the public over and over again how much he liked Playboy, gave his wife's nude pictures to his best friend, and encouraged this friend to watch his wife naked in the shower. The book definitely does NOT have a Christian slant."
4,Meerkat Manor Season 4,"I have absolutely loved this series and own all four seasons. The stories of these true characters are wonderful and educational. Unfortunately when the ""Next Generation"" came with season 4 the format of the show changed including the narrator. Although I still enjoyed the stories of this last season, apparently viewership fell off and the show was not renewed. I recommend owning the earlier seasons and watch before seeing this last one."
3,Average Coloring Book,"if u r looking for a good ref book on monsters, this isn't what u want. this is a COLORING BOOK. Unless u have a braty little kid who insists on coloring pictures of this sort of thing, i wouldn't buy it. Even though it says all ages, i wouldn't get it for anyone older than three. The books don't really have enough detail."
1,Where is my book?,I have not received my copy of this book yet...... do not know how to get in touch with anyone regarding this. Judith Rebelo
1,Paperback-DO NOT BUY,"This review refers to the paperback edition, every page of which is replete with editorial errors in spelling, punctuation, etc. This is, of course, a major flaw, as the syntax is often distorted, and, at times, incomprehensible. And, on top of it all, it is poorly bound, so that some of the initial pages are close to falling out. The translation itself, however, is very good. I would recommend this book, but NOT in the paperback edition, which is published and printed by Fine Offset Printing of Urdu Nagar, Lahore - Pakistan. This publisher is a disgrace to bookmaking."
4,Fun to read!,"I got this book just because it had a funny title, and it was better than I expected. Courtney V.D. Smith has her heart broken by her year long boyfriend ,Dave, right before senior year begins. This year proves interesting when she swears off boys, taking up student council instead. Still, she won't get over Dave, and a few of his friends, who happen to be boys, keep getting in the way. I felt like Courtney was almost a real person as I read her journal. This book is clever, and at some parts, laugh-out-loud funny. I enjoyed reading it and would reccommend it to girls ages 12+."
4,You Will Laugh Out Loud While You Read This !!!,"i had read so many reviews on this book and i had seen it a couple of times in the bookstore so i decided to buy it ,well i love this book its soo funny even though im not in the main characters situation i still feel like i know her and i understand how she feels, its so funny, you definitely gotta read this!!"
4,what does electric stories sound like,"Kevin M. Thomas. I am 10 years old and I really like the 4 seasons. They are great. I love many songs but my favorits are. TELL IT TO THE RAIN,LITTLE BOY IN GROWN UP CLOTHES, FALLEN ANGEL,PROUD ONE, O WHAT A NIGHT. And much more. But I really want to know what electric stories sounds like. TELL ME!!!! please."
5,3 CD-Set Worth Every Penny,Has all of the group's best songs as well as most of Valli's solo work. Fabulous sound and liner notes. The only Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons collection you need.
5,I'll never make brownies the same again!,"I received this pan from my sister for Christmas. It is wonderful and every single serving has at least two to three crusty sides. It comes with a spatula that just fits in the pan to cut the brownies. It cleans up very easily and I am very pleased. Handwashing is recommended, which I tend to do with my good pans any way to preserve wear and tear. I am anxious to try some other recipes in the pan."
5,YUMMY BROWNIES WITH EDGES!!!!!,"I LOVE the brownie pan!!! What a great invention for us ""edge"" freaks.... I like my brownies gooey so I didn't have to cook them as long as the recipe called for. Would highly recommend this pan to any one that loves ""edges"".... Definitely worth the price....Baker's Edge Nonstick Edge Brownie Pan"
5,LOVE THIS BROWNIE PAN!,"I love this brownie pan! For years, I have struggled with under or over cooked brownies, burnt, etc.. This pain eliminates all that! I order 10 more pans to ship to friends and family!!! It's a perfect gift for those who love brownies but not the hassle!"
5,Awesome product!,This is a funny looking pan which produces beautiful results. Every time I've used it the brownies have come out perfectly chewy and are a big hit. Great product!
5,If only every thing worked this well - PERFECT BROWNIES!,"Easy: Buy this pan. I love to cook and bake. This heavier than usual pan makes every single brownie in the pan equally yummy. No ""hard spots"" around the crust. No gooey chewey center. A huge hit! Highly recommended!"
4,Get a pen,Good pan. I had just moved and my new oven was a mystery too. You may need to experiment with time and temp to get 'em the way you want but after a couple it produces good results.
4,A Great Way To Bring In The 70's,"This is The Temptations first 1970's album. This album is very funky and contains some of their best harmonies. It includes such hits as ""I Can't Get Next To You"", ""Don't Let The Joneses Get You Down"" and ""Message From A Black Man"". Time was running out for member Paul Williams at this point as he was battling alcohol abuse. He does some of his best singing on this album. He quit touring with the band shortly after the release of this album. This unfortunately is another Hard-to find disc. If you get your hands on it for a descent price it's well worth the buy."
1,don't be deceived-,"This looks impressive and I loved it for the first couple of days. The Lexmark X7170 is without question the worst multifunction I've owned (it's my third). Scan quality was bad despite easy to use menu and controls. Difficult to use irregular shaped paper (4x6 or envelopes). Worst yet- paper feed went out before replacing my first ink cartridge. If you love the words ""paper jam"" this is the one for you. A chistle and a stone would be more effective."
5,Lisa Bouchelle is the real deal.,"If you are really into music, and appreciate pure talent, you have to get this CD....and better yet, go see Lisa perform live. This girl is awesome. I don't know what else I can say....the CD is fantastic, but seeing her perform live makes you want so much more....she has it all. She is gorgeous, great presence on stage and her songwriting is intelligent and evocative. But the best of all is that voice....like an angel. Buy this CD....listen....then you will see what I mean and want to go see her. PapaCarl"
5,BETTER WITH EACH ALBUM,"I loved Jon B. from the very beginning, and this album proves why. This album is amazing from start to finish. Jon just gets better with every album he comes out with. My favorites are HANDS ON YOU, PATIENCE, LAY IT DOWN AND WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU. This is a definite MUST HAVE!"
1,Poor Jon,"I'm a loyal fan of Jon B since ""Bonafide"" and have listened to his growth as a person and artist through his music. With this release it is obvious that there were a great deal of changes and difficulties in his life since ""Pleasures U Like."" Unfortunately, it appears that the music has suffered as well. There is less production by Jon himself on this album and like others have mentioned, his voice is very noticeably weaker. I'm still a fan, but ""Stronger Everyday"" is somewhat of a misnomer in my opinion."
5,GET THIS! AND WHY ISN'T HIS STUFF BEING PROMOTED?,"I AM 21 AND HAVE BEEN A FAN SINCE AGE 11 WHEN BONAFIDE WAS OUT!! This man is SO TALENTED. His writing actually has meaning and is INTIMATE without resorting to wearing protection just to listen to his music...lol. HE'S BACK.....JUST ONE PROBLEM.... U can tell that not all of the songs were done by him IF YOU'RE A TRUE FAN...and I LOVE his style...but...STILL A GREAT CD U CAN LISTEN TO WITHOUT SKIPPING SONGS. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE RELEASED THE STRONGER EVERYDAY ALBUM UNTIL I SAW IT ON HIS WEBSITE. I WENT TO BEST BUY IN VA TO GET IT, BUT IT WASN'T ON DISPLAY...SO I HUNTED DOWN A SALES PERSON AND ASKED IF THEY HAD IT IN THE BACK SOMEWHERE. THEY ONLY HAD 1 AND IT WAS IN THE BACK OF THE STORE WHERE NOONE WOULD EVER THINK TO GO UNLESS YOU WERE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR THIS ALBUM. GET THIS ALBUM PEOPLE. JON B IS ONE OF THE FEW ARTISTS OUT NOW WITH TALENT. DROP USHER'S WACK CONFESSIONS AND PLEASE PICK UP JON B!!!!ONE LUV,TIFF"
2,You get what you paid for,"Basically, this adapter works as advertised, but:1. This product is supplied with small CD that may not fit into slot of your CD driver. Then it will require you to copy the content to the different media that fits your computer.2. As I found during the FCC Part 15 Class A test - this product FAILS. It means that sales in the USA are illegal. You still may use it for your own purpose but if you resell it it must comply with FCC.3. Installation was a little shaky - depending on the operating system, but I was able to use it in 2000, XP and Vista."
4,Gets the job done.,"I bought this to install onto a Vista 64-bit system. I plugged it in and initially tried to use the included mini CD-ROM to load the drivers, but for some reason my DVD drive couldn't read it. So I let Vista find the drivers automatically and it installed the drivers easily.But it wouldn't work. I tried re-installing the driver, unplugging it and plugging it back in, but my computer still couldn't find the COM port. I finally rebooted my computer, and ever since then, this adapter has worked perfectly with no issues.It would've given it 5 stars if the driver installation had gone smoother. Other than that it works perfectly and I'm totally satisfied."
5,Serial to USB,I purchased this product to use with my new MacBookPro which I have both Vista and Mac installed. On the Vista side it worked great but on the Mac side there was an issue with the Palm software driver that prevented connection. After a week of researching a resolve Palm came out with a fix and now everything works.
1,Terrible customer service,I bought this and used it half a dozen times. It worked great. Then none of my computers would recognize it. Contacted J and R and Amazon. Was told the warranty was only through Cables Unlimited. Got an RMA after some difficulty and sent it back. Been over a month. I have emailed to ask status a few times with NO RESPONSE.BEWARE
1,It's a Dead End. It's so absurd that I stopped watching it after 15 minutes,"In this film, samurais fought with swords, guns and even anti-tank guns! It tried to be Mad Max but it failed miserably. The clothings and scene settings looked cheap and fake. The acting is like child's play. It's more like a comedy but it's not funny at all. How can they expect to make money with this? This is a typical bad B-movieIf you like Asian-style sword-fighting movies, look for House of flying daggers, Shinobi Heart under Blade, Shadowless Sword, Warrior (Korean movie), Iron Monkey. These movies are much better in terms of fighting and acting."
5,Good Music,I like the fact that this CD has so many of Ben E's top hits. Great music that brings back memories of when music was about the heart in love :) Reasonably priced.
4,Let the good times roll,Very clear and concise remastering. My wife alsways liked Ben E. King and this CD did not disappoint. All of his hits are on it and his style is smooth and melodious. Pricing was excellent and we liked the comments provided by Amazon on other items similar to this that we would like.
3,Informative!,I was skeptical about watching this film but it turned out to be very well done. It is not too graphic which I appreciated but still gave me better insight into this monster.
3,Good Product Terrible Manual,"Good Product, Terrible Manual.This manual is pretty bad. They put multiple languages on each page and for each instruction. When of course what they should've done was to have multiple sections for various languages.Even disregarding the above shortcomings the manual is still difficult."
5,Extremely thought provoking,"I too have been a dyed in the wool ""death penalty advocate"". While the read seemed like an investigative report at times (given the authors background and the books subject matter this isn't all bad) it opened the door to a world most of us civilians rarely if ever see. How many of us hold doctors, police, clergy and other professions to a standard (absolute perfection) that doesn't exist in our own professions or personal lives. Mr. Furhman has been able to shed light on the humanity (and all its fragilness) that exists in the life and death decisions made in our courts. Mind opening and thought provoking."
3,"best friend, indeed?","Best friend Flint decides to snatch Aura away from the groom, Paul. There is this spark between Flint and Aura, problem is that Flint is not the groom to be. Flint thinks he knows all about Aura. He thinks she is just looking to marry a rich man and live the life of leisure. How wrong he is! He calls it protecting his friend when he sits out to save Paul from the gold digger; more like he wants her for himself but doesn't want to admit it. Really not a bad way to pass the time."
3,Measure your tank! This didn't really fit my 40gal.,"I figured that an item that fits ""up to 60gal tank"" would fit my meager 40gal. In the end, I did manage to get it to fit, but I had to cut it into multiple pieces. The 75"" length was taller than my tank, but the 48"" width was not enough to get around the circumference (and no, it would not even remotely fit if rotated 90 degrees). I cut off the excess from the height and taped it to the remainder to enhance the width, and with some stretching, managed to get it around my tank. The small amount of tape provided was enough to hold it all together, but not enough to completely cover the seams as indicated in the installation instructions. Also, the R-value probably suffered a bit from compressing the insulation so that it could fit the tank. They could've won a 5-star vote if they'd included a more reasonable size blanket and a sufficient amount of tape."
1,Don't buy it!,"I purchased this product based on other reviews. Well, this 75"" blanket doesn't fit on my 50 gallon heater. I thought I was smart to measure the tank's circumference before ordering it, but I forgot one thing.The circumference of the tank is 75"", and so I thought it would be a perfect fit. Well, it turns-out that the blanket is 3.5"" thick and so I forgot to compensate that the blanket's thickness will reduce the overall length as I wrap it around the heater. So now it's 1 foot short and I can't close both of the ends.Besides looking ugly, it wouldn't be effective in its job to save energy. Now I will have to go look for an insulation piece 1 foot x 4 feet long from Home Depot to cover the silly opening.It's funny that they're advertising this product for 60 gallons when it doesn't wrap my 50-gallon tank that has 75"" circumference. I suggest you measure your tank first and then add at least 12"" on top of it to get a total blanket length you need. Good luck!"
2,just a chunk of insulation,Its just a square piece of fiberglass insulation. Was kind of hoping for clips or a strap or something.
2,so so,"a so so product, my son needed a fish for a school project. kind of a goofy item, not sure what it could be used for"
3,Simple Cover,"Simple little cover. Useful, but kind of expensive for what it is. Comes in a ridiculously large and difficult to open blister pack. Humminbird ought to throw this in with the fishfinder."
5,"A Readable, Moving , and Inclusive Memoir","Men have no reason to feel uncomfortable about reading and appreciating this book. I love Maria Hinojosa's memoir because it is easy to empathize with her efforts to become pregnant after past near misses. She writes about so much more than just pregnancy and motherhood, though. The book's richness resides in how honest and open she is about her struggle; and its impact on her relationships with her parents, husband, and friends. Even when she discussed painful topics and incidents, I detected no bitterness or sense of blame. Most of all, I appreciate Hinojosa's acknowledgement of spirituality as a constant pillar of her development. This is a rich, down to earth, and moving invitation into one woman's experience of parenthood, marriage, friendship, culture and love. Do not miss it!"
2,You get what you pay for,"These earrings were very inexpensive. I would rather have paid more and gotten a pair of earrings with a better clasp. They're also a little too small, but that was my fault for not looking at the specifications closely.I love the style, but I wish whoever makes these could use a better design. They're hard to put on and the metal bends easily."
5,Awesome,"I had one of these as a kid, and it eventually stopped working and i lost the balls for it. It works just as well as it did when i got it, only problem is to make sure you pump it enough, its touchy, but it was like that as a kid to, fun factor is still the same, everything came with parts, no instructions but you can find that online, was on time fast, i still give this 5 stars. Who I got it from THANK YOU!!!"
3,great!!!!!!!!!,My kids evry night can we play!!! i play with them and they get wet!!! All you get wet is just 2 sprays per time not much but at least they have fun!!!!!! BUy IT!!!!!!!!!!!P.S yoll love it!!!
4,A good place to start...,"There are four main tour books for the Maldives, and this one is a good place to start. (Another good one is the Michelin guide.) This book gives a general overview of the islands and many of the resorts. Divers will want the Divers' Guide to the Maldives to fill out the information here."
2,Big Joe Turner,Quality of the CD was very poor and made listening to some great old music almost impossible. Your sources need to be better for oldies.
2,"A ""PAGE"" in the history of baseball.","I must confess, until Woody Allen and Mia Farrow named their son ""Satchel"" I knew little with regard to this sports figure with the exception of infrequently shelving in the library, a biography book. When Allen-Farrow's son was born, I then had a number of queries regarding the man. I finally sat down and read about him when I had to read this book for a librarian's program, this being required reading. I remember the days when glass bottles would be returned to the local supermarket ""for pennies"" and those bottles would be refilled, as it is mentioned.Also,""fast talking, + slow walking""-- (and I was tempted to think)= begats slow working!His ""attitude"" problem, I HAD A PROBLEM with!The book is fine for anyone interested in baseball and/or the history of baseball."
1,Children of divorce are not lucky,"I thought this book was about cats and friendship with cats, until I read further and realized this book had an underlying message. The message is that Charlie is a lucky cat just like Elizabeth and Sarah. Elizabeth and Sarah are children of divorced parents and have to spend half of their time with each divorced parent. I understand that this is a fact for many children and they must make the best of it, but I wouldn't exactly say they were ""lucky""! I quickly made up my own words when I was reading this story to my own child , so that she wouldn't be subject to the underlying theme of the book. How sad, that the author feels that she must tell children they are lucky if their parents get divorced. Children of divorce know it's not true and this book is very patronizing in my mind. Skip it."
2,anything but this,This book is poorly written and follows a path of illogical twists and unnecessary turns. Choose a text that is more widely used and better written. Some of the text is unclear (visibly) simply due to poor publishing quality. Don't waste your money.
1,Not What You Need.,Some good advice but very low on content. No step by step instructions. Doesn't even come close to SEO for Dummies by Peter Kent. Peter's book is what you need.
1,Fragile Light? How About Eternal Darkness?,"Sometimes, a bad idea can turn into a wonderful piece of art that rightly deserves a place within the consciousness of the public. Sadly, David Nurenberg's debut novel does not fall into this category. It is not only poorly written, full of platitudes and cloying sentiment, but seriously in need of editing. Mr. Nurenberg is not only in love with the sound of his own voice, he is obviously married to it and in need of at least a trial separation. Nurenberg's characters are flat and lifeless, leaving the reader apathetic about what happens to them. As for this being a ""Herotown"" novel, where exactly is this town? It might be advisable to steer clear of all roads that lead there--there cannot be redemption there and if I were any of you, this is one light that I would be very afraid of. Save your time and your money."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"The other review was obviously written by someone related to the book. When you buy a Spanish learning book one of the most important things to look for is pronunciation. Well this book has very little of that, and when it does half the time it gives some pronunciation you cant even pronounce. Examples: ""desperdiciar.....dehs-pehr-SYAHR."" ""naranja.....nah-RAHN-hhah"". How the hell are you suppose to pronounce something with a double hh. This is a few but there are many more examples that are troubling. 1/4 of the book has pronunciations scattered throughout the book. The rest of it you have to guess how to pronounce the words. I have read 3/4 of this book and it has not been helpful at all in learning Spanish."
5,GREAT ITEM,Wonderful Duck callSoft ...easy to hold.Simple to use.Makes more than one callso you don't have to care more calls
2,Not good,Seemed as if it worked the first few times; then it became the deodorant I used at night or on a weekend. Would not buy again.
3,Needs Software Update,"This Wifi adapter needs new driver set. It works on some computers, but not others with the included drivers. However when I installed the generic Realtek drivers manually or let windows pick it out for me, there were no problems."
3,"Works fine, but . . .","I was excited that as a low-priced product from a budding company, this would have to be the best bet. It did do wonders for my old desktop that I'm actually getting great network connection even when the signal was ""very low."" The problem however was that the TEW424UB was not backwards compatible with USB 1.1 as the manufacturer suggested. After about a month of struggling with dropped signals, and the device itself being dropped by my PC, I almost gave up and had to buy a USB 2.0 card (assuming that it would make it work.) Fortunately, it had, and now I am typing this review with my old PC on a wireles USB.I gave it three stars for customer support though. They have responded readily (although they did still insist that this was backwards compatible). If you're going to use this either on an old PC or a laptop, make sure you're ready with a USB 2.0 port."
1,Broke after 4 days,"It worked well for 4 days then broke. No longer turns on. I'm debating whether to return it, but may not be worth the effort for the price. Overall, I'd buy another adapter."
5,Excellent product,I got this product within 2 days of ordering it and it worked perfectly. No problems at all.
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased this adapter last week. I tried installing it on 2 different computers (Windows 2000 and XP) and couldn't get it to work. I followed the directions completely. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software several times. I have an earlier version of this model that has been working just fine for the past couple of years. Unfortunately, this product isn't working the same way."
5,"fast, easy, works great","My old D-Link was having serious issues so I read the reviews ans settled on the TRENDnet, it has been working great. It is a space hog (covers 2 usb ports at once) but a usb hub would solve that if it were a problem. I saw some people complained about the cap, I took it off, problem solved. I saved it in case I decide to travel with it.Totally worth the price. Installation is a breeze! Works great!"
4,works fine but so thick it covers other usb ports,"This installed in a few seconds in Windows 7, but is so fat it blocks other usb ports and you can only use it in the top port because of the flipping top. It also seemed quite warm after using it for extended time, but it was tht right price."
4,Happy with performance for the cost,"I run a secured wireless network in my home (Linksys Super-G). I bought this adapter for use with an older laptop, which had USB 1.0 ports. On the same network my new laptop's onboard wireless gets 5 bars, this adapter with the old laptop picks up 4. I haven't had any connection dropping problems though. This past weekend I started a 27.3GB set of file transfers when I left for the day, it finally finished 12 hours later. That seems relatively slow, but I never notice much speed lag when I'm surfing the net. I've been impressed with how it's worked considering the laptop is almost a relic; and it nice to be able to get a guest's machine online by letting them borrow the adapter in the house."
1,unreliable and low throughput,"I used this for several months before finally giving up and replaced it with a DLINK G122. I installed the TEW-424UB on a brand new XP PC with the AP located 15 ft away. I rarely saw good signal strength and the data rate rarely peaked. All this was acceptable since my broadband connection only supported ~1Mbps anyway. What really annoyed me was the fact that the connection would die 2 or 3 times a day, requiring reseting the driver or sometimes physically resetting the dongle. After I replaced it with the DLINK G122, I saw excellent signal strenght and 54Mbps data rate from the same exact location.Given the low price and the fact that the TEW-424UB is not even WiFi certified, what I experienced probably should not have been a surprise. My recommendation is to stay far and away from this product."
4,Gets crazy hot!,"So far, works pretty well. The utility that comes with it sometimes acts flaky, and doesn't start or doesn't connect right away.For this type of solid-state device, it gets incredibly hot! Almost too hot to touch! Given that, probably not going to last long.The range is ok, nothing special. Of course, the greatest thing about these is the price."
5,Just plug it in,"I just plugged it in and Vista installed the drivers for me. I switch it between my laptop and desktop and it works perfectly everytime. Best $20 I ever spent. FYI, it gets warm when its running, but I wouldn't worry about it overheating."
1,The software is awful; stay away,"The hardware seemed fine, and the driver seemed to work, but the software is amazingly bad. If you configure it to go to a particular AP (which is normal), it will keep scanning anyway and drop the connection. When you reboot, it will not automatically connect to the AP you configured. You cannot remove the software without also removing the driver, making this a useless product. What a waste of an hour..."
5,Plano Tackle box,"That was fast and I got a chance to use it this father's day so I was really happy,Thank you!"
1,Not sure if this is the right product.,I ordered this and received just the plastic side pieces and square face plate but did not get thestorage pocket frame in the picture it was new in bag for my Kia from metra
5,Excelente,"Excelente producto de muy buena calidad y manufactura. Ajustó perfectamente en el espacio de mi KIA CARNIVAL (SEDONA) 2004, la instalación resultó muy sencilla y una vez colocada la radio, quedó muy bien ajustada y sin espacios vacíos, nadie pensaría que fue reemplazado, tiene la apariencia de una instalación original."
3,A re-issue would be welcomed,"Found this book in my friends bookshelf and was intrigued. Unfortunately, there was a lot of incomplete and mis-categorized information. None-the-less, this book really deserves to be re-worked. Possibly a great reference tool for adults and adolescents alike.Found a few items almost useful enough to get this as a unique reference."
5,Every writer needs this book,"There are three reference books I use all the time in writing: The Synonym Finder, the Random House Word Menu, and The Order of Things. I use these three books more often than a dictionary, because they help you *find* words that can be properly used, which is the primary exercise of a writer."
5,"""The BEST Christmas Present!"" was the general review","I bought my two-year-old nephew the Hopper for Christmas as an afterthought. It was the hit of the entire weekend! Six children, aged 2-6, had a great time playing with it and hopping around. Furthermore, it was relatively safe, as there is nothing to choke on and nasty falls are nearly impossible (unless they decide to hop down some stairs). Definite value for money!"
5,Hopper ball,Timely arrival of Hopper Ball. Granddaughter very happy. Great company to do business with. Thanks.
5,Wonderful! But a little too big.,"My girls received the Dora Hoppers for their 4th birthday, and they love them. However, true to the other reviews one of them loses air within an hour of being inflated. So I purchased this higher quality product. Unfortunately the ""18-in"" Tie Dye Hopper seems to be quite a bit bigger than that. I haven't measured it, but it's much bigger than the Dora Hopper which actually is 18"". The Tie Dye Hoppers have held their air though, and I look forward to the Summer when I'm sure the girls will be big enough to use them. Right now they hop around inside the house with their Dora Hoppers playing bunnies and laughing hysterically when their ""tails"" fall off! The Hopper in general is a great toy, and this more durable version is the way to go."
2,"Marlene wonderful, CD could be better.","This CD compiles Marlenes' best known songs. The sound quality is rather wretched,taken mostly from 78's but no re-mastering was performed on them.I think that these are original recordings, not radio transcriptions like the Amazon review implies. No liner notes either. What you do get is a lot of Marlene with several songs in both English and German. I do not know, but the collections on ASV or Arkadia are probably more reliable."
5,Great song!,"I absolutely love ""The Song of Crazy Horse."" I never thought I'd find another copy of the album and was thrilled when I found the CD was available. The title cut is a wonderful, beautiful piece of musical magic!"
5,Worked well for a thesis,I used this paper when printing my Master's thesis. The paper fit all of the qualifications for my school and had a nice texture and weight.
4,As good as other brand,"The paper is as expected. It is clearly different from common copy papers. The watermark can be at any place of a particular page of paper. If you tear the paper you can see long fiber which you won't be able to see from common paper. I have nothing much to say about the product, but I did leave a poor review of the packaging as the paper is damaged at on corner. The package I ordered was shipped from WA."
4,Great product...except for case,"I bought this set because it had all the sockets and wrenches I needed in one case. Additionally, very few people have black socket sets and it makes it easy to identify my tools on the job site. The one major complaint I have is the sockets falling out of their places when you open the case. It's not just one or two, but nearly half."
1,If I had the book I could review it!,"Awesome Books sends their CHEAP, USED books so that a signature is required! REALLY???? Just mail the book and be done with it! I don't have time to screw around with the post office. Where is my book??????????"
2,"This is a recipe book, not a book on aromatherapy.","If all you're looking for is a book of combinations of essential oils, with little or no explanation of aromatherapy or why the various oils are used, this may be the book for you. If you're interested in learning aromatherapy, I'd recommend books by Valerie Ann Worwood, Valerie Cooksley, and/or Jeanne Rose instead."
1,A sham of a book!,"This book is very simplistic in content and context! There is absolutely nothing in it that cannot be found with an internet search. It is, in my opinion, a complete RIP OFF! Basically the authors just typed up a bunch of information in a simple format.There isnothing great about this book and definately OVERPRICED for a mere 128 pages. I am returning it.................."
2,"Lots of Recipes, No Explanations","Wheee. Recipes. And no explanations.Okay, so there are lots of ideas here. Great. A short intro on essential oils and a couple tips. But really, any good book on essential oils will do the same and be more comprehensive.I suppose if you need inspiration this is a good book. But if you want to know WHY you should be using X and Y for Z, you'll need another book.I pick up this book when I want ideas for things to make. Otherwise, if I really want a book on essential oils, I look elsewhere."
4,Solid book but not worth the price,"I hunted it down at a research library and read various chapters, scanning through others. Yes, it's a good book, dealing with many aspects that do not exist in civilian life or not to the same extent, and each chapter includes a detailed bibliography. Chapters include:Personality Factors in Military PsychologyIndividual and Group Behavior in Extreme Situations and EnvironmentsOptimal Leadership in Small Army UnitsHostage NegotiationStill, you can find it in a library and read it there. There is nothing to justify the price (retail $900.00 according to Borders)."
5,Through the Shattered Mirror.,"Do you wonder what happened to the Phantom of the Opera after heexited through the shattered mirror in the movie??? I did.Jodi Minton has answered that question for me,with compassion,grace, hope and love. Jodi's Erik haslearned from his mistakes and his heartbreak. He has found the courage to look deeper into himself andfind his true spirit,and learns many valuable lessons about life and himself along the way.An elegant and uplifting story that can stand on it's own. I strongly recommend this delightful book."
3,Fat watermark,"Just FYI: the paper is good and nicely textured, but there is a FAT WATERMARK right at the center of each sheet. The description for the product tells you there is one, but I wasn't expecting the giant beacon of a watermark that tells all, yes, I indeed used Southworth paper for this."
4,good but was better...,"I bought, this product, couples years ago, and the presentation, was different, and worked better, but works well, I ordered one more for my wife."
4,Works as i expected,I used the screen clean kit for my Vizio flat screen HD TV and it works just fine. I was able to get the finger marks and dust off the screen. Im also going to us the cleaning kit on my lap top and second flat screen. I will be purchasing this again when I run out. Great Product.
4,works like a charm!!!!,"It really works, uses it on my tvs and computer monitor which r all LCDs,and let me tell u a little goes a long way Ive had same bottle for couple years now."
5,Must have cleaner,"This product works better than any other cleaning method I have used. The cleaning fluid is of high quality but the real gem is the microfiber cleaning cloth that is included. By using this system all of your displays will be crystal clean all the time. I tried it on plasma, LCD & even my camera lcd display & they never looked better. Highly recommended product for keeping very expensive displays looking great."
1,Water did the trick,"Of course I don't know if it'll work for everyone but I had the same streak problem from this awful product (had streaks for days after re-wiping numerous times) and decided to just use water. I wet the cloth (the same cloth from the package) with water and wiped in a uniformed horizontal way, and then allowed it to dry by letting the water evaporate. I checked back the next day and it looks great, no more streaks. This was on my Sony Bravia 32"" L-series. I understand the screen isn't the same for all TV's so it may not be the best thing, but it helped my dilemma."
5,Works Great,"I was a little worried because other reviewers have complained about streaks, but I suspect this was the previous cleaner before they removed the alcohol. I cleaned my plasma TV and two computer screens covered with kid fingerprints. They came out spotless and streak-free."
1,Just use distilled water,"I just followed the instructions on the bottle and used this on my LCD computer monitor. It left streaks all over my monitor. My suggestion is to use a microfiber cloth and distilled water. You might get streaks doing that, but you will with this product as well (and water is a lot cheaper).Don't waste your money."
2,Defective item,"I bought this item a few days ago, and I started to use it today.I found it cannot spary out liquids,because the upper hole is blocked.I am very disapppointed."
3,thin line,"Be aware this is for line smaller than 3/8"". smaller bow rail also. Check the specs. Have two packs 4 pieces if anyone needs them."
1,$39 A YEAR SUBSCRIPTION FEE!!,I liked it until it announced that I either pay $39 for each year or bye bye - which it did. I bought two of them like a fool.
1,Did not work for me AT ALL,"A few things this toys description neglects to tell you, or even warn you of: In order for you to have enough space for all of these parts to work, your kid has to stand up in the tub. I don't know about you, but my 2.5 yr old isn't allowed to stand up in the tub. Theres no way they could reach to put the water in and let it fall through all of the fun parts while seated. It just doesn't happen. Secondly, if you have a molded plastic tub/shower enclosure, the suction cups don't stick. Yeah, you might get one or two to hang on for a half a minute, but they're off ALL the time, and god forbid your toddler touches one, then they definately fall off instantly. Maybe this toy would be fun if you had an older child that likes to stand in the bathtub and a tile shower enclosure that the toy might stick to. This was a waste of money for me and my child was disappointed and confused."
5,truly touching!,"A truly warm, touching, lovely story! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to restore their faith in the power of love and belief in destiny. I loved it!"
3,it's OK,The lotion is kind of greasy for my skin. It leaves a tacky touch but it does moisturize somewhat. I only use it for day time when I leave home. At night I still use my Chanel regime which make my skin softer and non greasy.
3,Six Ingredients or Less Chicken Cookbook,"Six Ingredients or Less Chicken Cookbook is acceptable, and does offer a number of helpful recipes.Lack of decent pictures for the finished ""product""(recipe) leaves the book rather lacking. Only picture was on the outside front cover.Will stick with the magazines (which are abundent in the supermarkets) and/or the Americas Test kitchen cookbooks."
2,Save your time,"Very little new information. You won't find much in this book that hasn't been written elsewhere numerous times. Author also has some sort of vendetta for off road motorcycling. He really needs to research his sources better to avoid such pitfalls. Should have checked this out of the library, but they didn't have it."
3,Those bastards,"How could they ruin such an awesome game? They made the AI better, which despite what you might think, is not a positive thing. Enemies will hardly stand in a good position to use magic. So mages/wizards have pretty much become obosolete (which were some of the most useful characters in the original). Also, the first playthrough was w?y too easy. I didn't even die once. My main character killed Darksol in 3 hits. Not to mention that card using character. If you clone your strongest character, there's no way you can lose. Can you say, overpowered?Oh, and it's supposed to get harder with every playthrough, but seeing as this remake is so challengeless that you'll never play it more than once, that seems pretty pointless.But the original was fun. And this one would probably be to if I hadn't played the original. So I'll give it a decent score."
4,Old-School game still delivers fun,"I used to play Sega's Shining RPG games on the Genesis and, later, Saturn, and I loved the Shining Force games. Of course, RPGs have gotten a lot more complex and sophisticated since then, but every once in a while it's fun to go back to the old school. The first Shining Force game has made a great transition to the GBA, with the original music and game play intact, plus some new features. It's not a particularly challenging game compared to some of what's out there now, but i was surprised how much I still enjoyed playing this game again. How about it, Sega? Can we have Shining Force 2 and 3 too?"
4,Special high quality paper,This special paper was a gift to my grand daughter who is finishing her Master's degree and needed a very good paper to print it on. I think she is very satisfied.
3,Not that bright,To see that much light you will need a lot of these floaters. Not recommend for average swimming pool.
2,Toyota MR2 Spyder owners beware,"If you are looking at this product because it came up under bump stops for a Toyota MR2 Spyder, do not get them. They are not the right part and will not fit. Other than incorrect fitment they are a good product and seem to be well made."
5,A journey into the life of a Tibetan Monk,"This has to be by far one of the most influencial books I've ever read. It lends insight into a culture and tradition that is very foreign to us in the western world. The anecdotes mixed with Buddhist ideology lends itself to a very readable and personal story while still relating the main precepts of what Buddhism is all about.His kindness and understanding are by far the most salient aspect of the book, and leads the reader to make judgements about their own practices and daily lives.For anyone interested in learning more about Buddhism as well as for anyone interested in the plight of Tibet, this is a must read!"
4,pretty good speakers,"Have had these speakers about 3 years and they are still going strong. I like that they light up and that they have a normal 3.5 mm headphone jack so I can plug it into my computer, mp3 player, tv, or even keyboard with an adapter. They have been a very good purchase for the price. I recommend them."
4,works nice for powered speakers,"I use it in my Moms room for her dvd player, the speakers need plugged in but they are loud enough and sound good for a budget set of speakers."
4,Works well,This product works well. Not quite as well as a similar product I purchased a few years back in regard to sound volume and quality but I like it.
5,Cyber Acoustics CA-3550 2.1 Computer Speakers.,This 2.1 speaker system from Cyber Acoustics works good for music and movies from my computer.The price is okay for the sound quality.
1,Just a nightmare,To many pieces for your kid to loose. Not at all sturdy. In any mode the magnets fly off.
3,Shaman King Vol 3:Pai Long Attacks in Dec. of 2005!,"Hello Shaman King fans,I just wanted to say that there are allot of reports that this series has been pushed back as for DVD release goes. Kinda wierd that they would push this back after two DVDs but this does add up as you will not find Shaman King Vol. 3 anywhere (unless you import it.) I have tried to order this from places that said they have it in stock,from stores that told me they were sold out and looks like they do not have anymore in inventory to on-line sites that say they have copies (in both cases they had NONE).So if you are a fan of the series like me and waiting for the other DVDs to be released,please note they have not come out yet and from what I am hearing we are looking closer to Dec. of 2005 (but I would not be upset if that changed to a closer release date). Till next time...-John-P.S.Please note I give this 3 stars only because I have to rate this item. I love the series and for me,this is a MUST have (it is a series)."
5,The Perfect Combo of Nuts and Fruits,"I love Peeled Snack's Figsated. First of all, it is the only dried fruit combo I have ever seen with figs, and they are delicious. Also, the nuts are delicious and fresh, not stale like many dried nuts. Also, the nuts are GOOD nuts - you get pistachios and almonds. I love this snack and like to take it on any plane ride I take or just carry it around as a great, healthy pick-me up for the afternoon munchies."
3,Good Collection,"Half of this collection is good Bread, the rest is so-so. Their ballads are sappy, and the lyrics weak, but the music that supports it all helps make up for these faults."
5,a must have collection,"I've always been a fan of bread and I thought I'd be satisfied with a single cd collection. After all, it would include all of the hits. However, there are many other great songs on this collection. The David Gates solo songs are a big plus for this collection (Goodbye girl, took the last train, clouds, never let her go, where does the lovin' go, etc.)There are also some lesser hits and album cuts that are great songs (hooked on you, the chosen one, too much love, let your love go, look what you've done, etc.) If you love 70's ballads, you'll love this collection."
3,OK!,There are other CD's in her catalog alot funnier than this one.....I just wanted it because it was Lawanda Page.....
2,Damn this watermark,Somehow every page I printed the damn Southworth logo found a way to peek through the blank spaces because it's printed inconsistently and TOO DAMN CONSPICUOUSLYI don't really want to risk it so I might have to go out to look for unmarked resume paper.
1,Big ugly watermark,"Don't you love the way photographs look when they have a watermark splashed across with the studio's logo or the word ""PROOF""?What? No? Well, then you should probably not buy this paper. The watermark is tacky and unprofessional, especially if you want it to look great down to the details. (Which is the whole point if you're spending this much on paper.)Rather than looking like premium paper, it looks like a discounted/sponsored version of their paper with an advertisement for the company. I wonder when they will start putting Google Ads at the bottom of their paper. (NOTE TO SOUTHWORTH: That was a joke. Please do not actually do that.)"
4,Most Interesting and Educational!,"After viewing this DVD, I found it very informative and educational. I personally enjoy learning about people's cultures and lifestyles. So learning cultural Ghanian dances, even though different, there was something fun and appealing about doing the dances as I watched. The music was upbeat and the dance moves were rhythmic and soulful. I suggest anyone who's open-minded, loves change and loves to dance.....to check this out!"
4,Laura Nyro: Walk the Dog and Light the Light,"With the exception of Angel in the Dark,which was released after Nyro's death, this is the last album from an artist who deserves to be re-discovered by anyone who is into female artists of great integrity like Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush, Björk and Regina Spector. On Walk the Dog . . . Nyro has come a long way from the breathtaking tempo changes, the contrasts and the sometimes brutal intensity of her early masterpieces Eli and the 13th Confession and New York Tendaberry. This is mature, relaxed music,yet with the accuracy and precision typical of Nyro - and of producer Gary Katz. Katz helped create the sound of Steely Dan, and Walk the Dog . . . has the same fresh, timeless quality, apart from the drums, which have a typical 80s quality."
3,Disappointed,I bought this tv thinking I was getting the best analog tv that's out there. I was disappointed to discover I was wrong. On the whole the picture quality was great except that the lower left corner of the image was distorted and curved up. This proved very annoying and I looked terrible on letter boxes since it was not square.
2,Questionable value,"Although my son loves the print on these sheets, the fitted sheet is lacking elastic. He's sensitive to fabrics, but hasn't complained about them feeling scratchy at all, even though they are rougher than I had hoped. I was disappointed in the actual color of the sheets; they aren't bright white at all. They're kind of a yellowed white that makes them look kind of old. All things considered, I was pretty disappointed in the quality for the price. The only redeeming factor is that the print has a wonderful variety of brightly colored construction vehicles, as opposed to the few different trucks featured on other sets I looked at."
4,"Smooth, soul music","This CD has all of Patrice Rushen's greatest hits. If you are a Patrice Rushen fan, this is truly the CD for you. Nice, smooth R&B music. Worth the buy"
5,You got to get it!!!,"I already had The Cars: Greatest Hits, but this Anthology simply has it all. There are some of the greatest hits of the late 70's and early 80's. When you listen to this CDs you dive yourself back into your teens, and remember great friends, parties and stuff. You got to get it!!!Pedro M."
2,Anthology???,"I do not yet own this ANTHOLOGY, and probably won't. My thought is that an Anthology was pretty much the complete works. This pales in comparison to an anthology. The extras like b-sides and such are nice but give me all the recordings, (all tracks on the albums) and some extra's perhaps...That Would Be An Anthology For Me!!!"
3,"Bulky, but keep the light out","These eye shades are quite bulky, but they do keep out the light. The cheap shades I got from the airline do not work for me. I'm very sensitive to light and they let in the tiniest amount. I got these to try to reproduce the effect of shades I got in business class many years ago when they were giving out better quality shades. Those had the perfect balance of softness and thickness. These are a bit much. The design is supposed to relieve pressure on the eyes. I don't mind the pressure, but, if anything, these cause added pressure. I am concerned the added bulk will make them hot in the summer. The Velcro closures wear out and the overlap of the strap it necessitates adds to the bulk. On the positive side, other than the velcro, they do seem made to last.5/27: They are indeed too thick to wear in warm weather. I've downgraded my rating from a 4 to a 3. They are soft, but too thick to be comfortable."
3,"It is NOT ""Out Stealing Horses""","This is book disapppointed me by not reaching and exceeding the level of the astounding ""Out Stealing Horses."" Once I calmed down and thought about it I came to accept it as a good early work with SOME flashes of the charm and high art that will later be seen in Mr. Petterson's masterpiece. If you want to see how an author develops by all means read it.If you want to read another really great book of fiction then get ""The Blind Assassin"" or ""The Stone Diaries"" (by other authors)."
2,is it Bubba Wolf or Yela Sparxx?,He sounds way too much like Bubba Sparxx on this album for my taste. I'm glad Yela Wolf found his own voice on later albums.
1,Not a fan,I thought this book was dull and poorly edited. I was expecting a more interesting book. I was disappointed in the content and the delivery.
4,Great Zevon Collection,I was looking for a collection of Zevon music that spanned his repertoire. This collection contains the popular stuff and some of his eclectic material. This collection was not available on iTunes at the time I purchased it.
2,Ghost Lips,"Too white. It can be rubbed in so it's not real bad, but you may not have a mirror whenever you want to reapply so you could make yourself look really goofy. It is also very soft so it is hard not to use a lot more than you need. If you waste half or more of the product, it is essentially much more expensive than its already high price."
4,Nice album!,This is another nice album by Aterciopelados. Not their best but still highly recommended.
3,THE SPOTLIGHT'S ON TEXAS FOR TOTS AND TYKES,"This is a slim beauty of a book with the friskiest rabbit and snappiest turtle youngsters have ever seen.The characteristics of the animals remind young ones that we are all different and special in our own ways.And, why was the jackrabbit given such long ears? You'll have to read the story to find out. But, remember: The better to hear you with m'dear."
2,Bess At Perkins,"This book is about a girl named Bess. She became blind in a bad sledding accident. She ran into a tree. Bess had to have surgery more than once,but it never helped. Bess's uncle said she should go to a school called Perkins. Perkins is a school for the blind. Bess belived she should go,so she could do things for herself. Bess didn't belive in havig her family do everything for her. At Perkins she shares a room with two girls. Bess does pretty good there,but she has such a hard time learning brial.There she also learns to arrange her food so she will know what kind of food she is eating. Every weekand she gets to go home. She has a twin sister. That is why it is called ""Mirror Mirror"". Her and her sister are mirror twins. She comes to learn facinating thing. Bess learn more about being blind,and herself. This book will make you think about what is like to be blind. It is awesome!!!!!!!"
3,more comfortable,"This product is hard to find due to the popularity of the all-in-one solutions; most stores phased it out over a year ago. However, my eye doctor recommends the hydrogen peroxide type overnight solutions, and I can feel the difference in my lenses- more comfortable, and even more important- my lenses last longer!"
3,Empty Game,"I love Final Fantasy. Even though I had only played IX, X, and X-2, I still thought I had a decent grasp of the series, and that FF games were always the embodiment of excellence. I've changed my mind. I believe that in any form of entertainment, the story is the heart and soul. If that is true, then FF XII is a zombie. A beautiful, souless zombie. Are the gods of Final Fantasy trying to compete with contemporary American cinema? 10 million dollar budget for special effects, 5 bucks to some preschooler to write the story? We can only hope this was a fluke, that before XIII is released they will come to their senses."
4,Very good game,"The graphics are good and the game is fun. However there are a lot of long cut scenes. Although the scenes look fantastic, it's overkill. Overall I would recommend this game to any final fantasy or rpg fan."
2,Not The Best,"Final Fantasy XII, like all other FF games has an increadable gameplay, storyline, and not to mention graphics.But the reason I gave it such a low rating was simply the characters! There was no character development, or love or any fun between them. They were BORING. They truly made the game forgetable.Ashe was probably my favourate character, but only because it seemed like she did the most talking. I didn't feel like I ""Knew"" the characters as much as I did in FFIX, FFX, or even FFX-2.Dissapointing at the most - with the characters.Otherwise a good game."
4,any easy victory,The first boss actually more of a sub bosses is ridiuculous easy. You will have about six peopl helping you hit him. Hit him about 150 times he won't be couplet defeat but a cut scene will trigger the device will fle to be repaired. There is not going to be a mandtory evil boss after this for several objectives. The next one will be in undeground waterway mission. I suugest you either get by figthing normal enemies or do some of the special boss fights against one of the 13 summon characters which will probaly be Belias the Gigas he appear's the earliest exactly were I don't know .
1,Terrible,"This was the textbook for a Philosophy 1000 class I just finished. Reading it all but guarantees that students will never take another philosophy class.It is a dry, boring, timid, and tepid exploration of the history of philosophy. It leads you to the conclusions they want, and although it obsessively focuses on the subject of God, it treats the subject with kid gloves. Maybe because it was written by professors at the University of Tennessee in Martin, they didn't want to offend the sensibilities of the local born-again christians.The worst philosophy book I have ever read."
2,Rented this and laughed myself silly.,This movie is really bad. A group of football players crash in the mountains and get attacked by a Yeti. This film features some of the worst CG effects I've ever seen and includes a great scene where the Yeti rips off a guys leg and then beats him with it. LOL funny. My recommendation: rental only. If you get lucky you can catch it on Sci-Fi.
5,"Cookies, Cookies and more cookies",Being Italian it was a great cookie cook book. I read this book cover to cover and used many of the cookie recipes for my Christmas trays for friends and family. I know you will enjoy this book.
4,excellent selection of recipes,"Well written, nice selection of traditional Italian cookies, just what I was looking for. So far, I've made the biscotti and the sesame cookies and both were delicious.My only complaint is that the ingredients list is printed in a tiny font that is very hard to read and makes it easy to make a mistake on measuring - so read the measurements carefully. If not for that I'd have given it 5 stars."
4,"Swiss Gear 17"" ;aptop backpack","This backpack works great. It is large enough to hold my 17"" HP monster. I ride a bicycle to work and the support is wonderful. I have no issues with stress on my shoulders or back. I have only had it for a month or so, so I can not attest to the durability of the backpack. I gave it a four out of five due to the fact there are no slots for cds or other media and no pen/pencil holders. Everything is kinda just thrown into the compartments. Also, why do all the other Swiss Gear backpacks have a specific spot for MP3 players and this one does not? I couldn't figure that one out. All in all a great backpack and it will have room for the largest laptops."
5,1 Bag to rule them all.,"Pros: HUGE !!!! I was able to fit my 15.6 laptop, 17"" cooling bed, all my clothes, my car and suv and still had room for 2 children and a dog. Very well build bag.Cons: Missing a jet pack.Other Thoughts: Swis gear put a ton of thought into creating this bag.Even when sitting on the ground, your laptop never touches it. The inside ""chamber"" that holds the laptop is suspended off the bottom of the bag......this is the only bag that I have come across to have this feature. For extra protection against water, put your lappy into a sleeve with the zipper facing down."
3,Reconstructed Inner Life of John Perks,"John appears from the book to be a brilliant articulate schizophrenic. The book is almost exclusively his reconstruction of his thoughts and fantasies from the (much earlier) time when he was associated with Chogyam Trumpa.One may learn incidentals about Rimpoche's idiosyncasies, but very little about the character, thoughts, or feelings of anyone except John Perks. Other than mention of yiddams and practices, and the experience of being around a ""liberated"" lama, there is not much conventional discussion of teachings.John is an interesting ""character"" and his thoughts, fantasies, and actions are interesting and engagingly told. He might not be someone you wanted around anybody or anything you valued. But then, the same was probably said of Trungpa Rimpoche."
4,Sad story,Interesting insight in to polygamy and Church of latter day saints. Heartbreaking in parts. Probably could have been written as a short story.
4,"Light weight, lots of pockets","I would give this a 5 but I have only had it for 2 weeks. So far it has met my expectations. I bought it for use with my photo equipment; extra lens, filters, etc. The back is 2/3 mesh for use in warm weather & I ordered a large so I could wear it over my jacket in cooler weather. Construction seems very good and there are plenty of pockets for gear. Has straps on each shoulder with Velcro closures to keep your camera & binocular straps in place."
3,The Recording Technician should be shot!,"This was played very well, but why do I have to listen to Trucks driving by outside the auditorium? With about a week of waveform editing this has become the best recording of this material I have ever heard. I record professionally and I feel that it is as much an art as the musicians performace. It could have at least had some post editing. 10 stars for the preformace and a minus 7 stars for the pre and post production work not done."
3,Fantasy fodder,"It was a fun adventure to participate in with the characters. I found it interesting to read a story set in my locale with references to landmarks of my life. Knoxvillians should enjoy this use of our setting. Perhaps a personal life unlike most in reality, but substance for fantasies."
4,Good product,"Got these for paddling dragon boat!!!! The padded seat is a bit small (more for biking) which is what they are meant for, but great just the same......... Bike shorts are still the go to for paddlers, as no one has really come up with a good short specifically for Dragon boating!!!!! Will order them again if/when they ever wear out!!"
5,A treasured book!,"What a wonderful book! Rosie's letters and journal entries transport the reader to the 1940s like no other book I have read. This book offers a keen insight, as well, into the American Red Cross, an organization that is what it is because of people like Rosie. Bravo!"
2,"Poetry is abundant, sincerity is lacking","My title just about sums it up. Annie Dillard uses very cute metaphors and word choice to convey her relationship with writing, but the whole thing fails to ring true. Her claims that she hates writing are contradicted by her sickeningly happy, cloud-borne tone; her metaphors are interesting but fall apart when examined as actual metaphors for writing.This work seems like an author with a contract trying to fill up 100 pages with as many ways to state ""Writing is hard"" as she can. She succeeds in fooling many of her readers into thinking she is saying something interesting or sincere. But I read her pretentious pontifications and I'm not impressed."
1,Gertrude and Virginia Write a How-To Book?,"Wonder what it would be like if Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein collaborated on ""how to"" book for writers? Well,wonder no more...meet Annie Dillard and her book ""The Writing Life."" While this book is supposed to inspire writers and offer useful tips on becoming writers, it instead drowns in overly-smug images, metaphors and useless information--like a ""stream of consciousness"" textbook! After reading it, I got the feeling that one sometimes gets when one doesn't understand a modern painting--""Well, then YOU must be too stupid!"" Picking out the pearls of wisdom on writing through the flowery prose isn't worth the effort. For a much, much better inspirational book for writers with GREAT suggestions and tips, get ""Bird by Bird"" by Anne Lamott."
5,A must have for every writer's library,This is a fantastic book! I have not yet read the whole thing but every word so far is beautiful and true!
1,Out of Stock,"Item is not in stock in any size and should not be listed on Amazon. They sent me UVA boxers, I go to Virginia Tech and that is our rivalry team, what are they thinking? Very disappointed in this Amazon store. Don't be tricked, when you click a size, it tells you there there are X number left, but there are none. However, Sales Rep was very nice and shipping the wrong item back was free, but that should be expected."
2,Not for the Average Joe,"If you are living in a large metropolitan area, wearing designer clothing and drinking $5.00 cups of coffee while chatting on your internet enabled handheld--then by all means buy this book! It was written for you and will, no doubt, help you simplify your life tremendously. However--if you are an average american--perhaps with a college degree and a family and a car that is more than three years old--think twice before buying this book. It has a lot of practical advice--don't get me wrong--but it is so common sense that most of you already do these things. Because, like most of us, you have to do them in order to pay the bills and feed the kids.But the rest of you prada wearing people out there--put that coffee cup down and run out to pick up this book. You'll be happy you did."
4,untitled,"If you enjoy a great pop song or simply enjoy the chase then this disc will provide you with satisfaction on both scores.Cope seems to have admirers and detractors in equal number but let's not quibble about the mans talent, he is still out there attempting to produce Stonehenge from a pebble,one of rock's last great alchemists.This is certainly better than some of his output and deserves more attention."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"I'm a huge fan of Monty Python and Eric Idle. This was okay, but not great. There were a few good cuts, but the rest was just sorta kinda like Beatles music, but not enough to make the songs the clever parodies I know Eric is capable of producing. So I was a bit disappointed."
2,Mix of Obvious and Repetitive Advice,"265 Troubleshooting Strategies presents a number of ideas to prevail over writer's block when writing non-fiction. Clouse covers areas from first drafts, rewrites, and for final revisions.The content is clear and straight forward and many of the ideas are practical. The book is lacking because the strategies are thin and mildly repetitive. The book is also filled with far too much obvious advice such as ""Have other writers read your draft to make suggestions"" and ""use the internet for research."" The instructions on editing offer nothing that isn't available in any book on revision.With such a large amount of books available for writing and editing, 265 Troubleshooting Strategies is left very far back in the pack. Better choices are ""Getting the Words Right"" by Theodore Cheney or ""A Manual of Writers Tricks"" by David Carroll, both of which give a far more comprehensive guide on improving your prose as well as many fresh new ideas for writing."
4,Nice little toddler table to go with the matching bed.,I like this little table. It is just the right size to go with my daughter's toddler bed.
1,r they repeating,r her songs beings recycled! beauty and the beast agaiN! gosh spare us with your songs!
1,R U ALL SLEEPING,"she sounds like s**t u know, her voice is really fading like a falling star! this album is a big turn-off and i really regretted buying this piece of garbage! trust me its not woth the money at all!"
4,A worthy buy,"Most people who relish songs like My Heart Will Go On and Because You Loved Me, might have put this CD out of the spotlight. In one of Céline's first English albums, we hear her burgeoning career crafted by writers of her more recent hit songs like Diane Warren (Love Can Move Mountains, If You Asked Me To, Nothing Broken But My Heart) and David Foster. One interesting song is by Prince, who having discovered Céline's talent had especially wrote it for her. Céline never fails to use every bit of her soul to sing these songs, and millions can attest to her insuperable dedication in singing, singing well. However, expect to hear quite a different voice from how she sings now... She can be a little loud and explosive sometimes in this CD. A well worth CD. Recommended."
5,Every album gets better and better,Céline has a unique quality which no one else has and that is what has made her so popular. From Beauty and the Beast to the remake of The Power of Love she has touched the hearts of many people. This album is a definate for collectors because it has allot of hit titles and many other great songs.
5,One of Celine's greatest album!,Celine has an amazing voice and this is one of her best albums. Every song touches your heart in a very special way.
3,Don't listen to them,"The person below me said that the only downside to this record are the Paul Westerburg songs.I just wanted to put in my two cents.I actually think that they are the ONLY reason to own this.They are great,whereas the other songs are pretty much 90s grunge crap."
4,Great Gift,This was a gift to my hubby who loves the song about a Hippo for Christmas. It was a hard song to find and it was a perfect gift.
4,Uneven but more good than bad.,Great collection of Christmas novelty songs. The one of the dogs singing Jingle Bells is just annoying. However I personally enjoyed the rest of the album. They are all delightful and for the most part lesser known Christmas songs.
3,Definitely a novelty CD!,"I bought this CD because it has the song ""I Want a Hippopotamus For Christmas"" on it and I like some of the other songs on it as well. But, not too many others. It is definitely a novelty item for me. Although Cheech and Chong's song does make me laugh. If you have all the classic CD's already and are looking to add a little variety to your collection, then this is a good one to add. Enjoy and Happy Holidays!!"
2,Listen before buying,"I haven't ordered this CD. Thank heavens that Amazon allowed all the songs to be previewed first. This album was intended to be a gift, for someone who is not familiar with the ""Grandma Got Run Over"" or the ""Hippopotamus"" song. I think he'd listen to the whole thing once, copy those two songs, then trash the CD. And I couldn't blame him. I can't imagine very many people who would like the other songs. Yuck!"
5,The American Story Pure and Simple,"With his story of struggle for freedom, dignity, and overcoming adversity, no one is more American than the African American. Ray Charles distills and delivers this message with a quiet power, gentleness, grace, and humility, especially when he sings ""America the Beautiful"" and ""Georgia On My Mind."" He has left us now, but not before giving us an enduring expression of who we are and who we can aspire to be. If you are any young American unfamiliar with Ray Charles' work, know that his art is part of who you are."
4,Sammy da Bull,"This was an interesting read. Read it for an Orgnized Crime class. There were some funny incidents this ""former"" mobster was involved in. Peter Maas did this book some justice, by laying the text in layman's term. Easily understood, the life of this Bensonhurst raised Sammy Gravano...Who was the underboss tht turned his back on John Gotti, the underboss who got away with 19 murders and the ""former"" underboss who just got arrested on drug charges in Arizona..Makes you wonder, will the Government ever stop making deals with the devils?"
5,Perhaps the best underworld book I've read,"Sammy's life and times. No punches pulled. Sammy was a consumate gangster and a very astute business guy. When you read this Bio you realize that movies like GoodFellas and the like are very close to the mark. Very enlightening. Overall, a great book."
5,"This ranks right up there with ""The Company She Keeps""","This book really gives you a look inside the darkness of the underworld. The woman's version of this book is ""The Company She Keeps"" by Georgia Durante. If you like mob books, both of these are an excelent account of life in that world. They tell it the way it really is."
3,"Hey Sammy, you got off, now tell us the REAL story!","It's not that I doubt much of what he's telling the readers, it's just that I don't want the ""kindler, gentler"" Gravano. I understand that he feels remorse for what he has done, but it doesn't make for AS exciting a read when you feel like it is just a big apology or an excuse. Also, I have a hard time buying that he was as good a streetfighter as he claims. Guns--yes, fists--I don't know..."
3,Quality product? No!,It is nice and sturdy set but paint on spoons chipped the first time we used them for play.
2,Not for newbies,"I am brand new to Coreldraw 12 and purchased this book with the idea that it would help me quickly learn the basics. Each time I needed help and went to this book, I was disappointed by the fact that it either didn't explain how to perform the functions I was trying to execute, or I couldn't find it altogether. I ended up finding answers to all my questions on the good old web or the tutorial that came with the program"
2,Misleading Information,"The book only covers Coreldraw, yet the reviews and the description of the imply that it also covers Photo-Paint"
2,Hoover 2 Year Replacement Plan,"I would ""LIKE THE PAPER WORK FOR THE 2 YEAR REPLACEMENT PLAN"" !THEN I WILL WRITE A REVIEW!!!"
3,"A Good, Light Read!",I have read one other book by this author (A Breath of Fresh Air) and liked it also as I like this one. I love the Indian authors and their style of writing. This book was light and easy to read. I loved the characters as they stand on their own and the interaction with each other. The twist at the end did surprise me a little and was pleasantly surprised. We think we know the characters and how the story ends but really don't. I will definitely read another book by this author. I rated this book 3 1/2 stars.
2,"Oh, please...",Somebody give me a Rolaid! The glowing reviews of this book made me sick to my stomach...the reason I stop trusting glowing reviews to begin with! The real poop...THE MANGO SEASON is a rather unimaginative story and without tension and plot development required to make this a good book. Not a total waste of paper (at times) a line or two made me smile but not that often. I should have spent my money on Hillary's new book instead now that surely would have bought a smile or ten to this mug of mine!
3,Nice read,"I liked the book. The story was relatable, but in some areas the story dragged. The ending was disappointing. I was hoping for more detail. So I would rate the book a okay read."
3,Good read but not so true,"This book is about Priya, an attractive indian girl with a successful career in the silicon valley and AN AMERICAN BOYFRIEND.The author has a very interesting way of developing the story.But, the story in itself is not very creditable. The author definately handles the Indian families pretty inaptly. Priya is continously disrespectful of all her elders and no one says a word to her. In fact by the end of the story, almost every younger member in the family ends up insulting the elders.I belong to a traditional brahmin hindu family myself and all this continous outrage did not make any sense to me. Family structures in India are much stronger than what the author depicts them to be.Also, the book had a major technical flaw. Priya's mail to Nick bounces back 'coz Nick's laptop is stolen. Well, the emails are stored on the servers and then delivered to individuals. Hence, loss of a laptop does not make a mail bounce.Overall, the book makes interesting one time read."
2,Good luck getting the balls through the holes!,"This toy is good in theory, but terrible in practice. The holes on top are way too small to accommodate the balls without some major banging. My 8y.o. can do it, but my 5 y,o. can't, so forget about my 1 y.o. ever being able to play with this by herself. And that major banging that's required? It's LOUD! It drove me so crazy hearing my 8 y.o. hammering away (she was the only one who liked this toy) that I'm returning it to the store.There are much better ball toys out there. Skip this one."
4,Good but not the Greatest,We bought this toy because we liked the cause & effect sequence it taught (if you push the ball through the hole you receive a viusl reward). We also liked that the colored balls matched up with the ball openings (Reinforces colors and matching). Our only dissappointment was the hammer. It takes a great deal of force to get the hammer to push the balls through the holes. If your child is sound sensitive (like mine) the hammer is an immediate turn off and becomes more of a stresser . Our remedy: we threw out the hammer and we have our child place both hands over each ball and push down. It's still a bit hard to get the ball to drop down but with assitance our child loves it.
5,Written with style,"""All I Need"" is an excellent novel. It really made me take a look at my best friends and our friendship with one another. Most authors overlook the importance of friendship, but ""All I Need"" is in a category of its own. This novel was filled with occasional melancholy, humor and I found it to be unique and thoroughly entertaining."
2,College Performance,"Don't expect a high quality recording: this is the original (and only recorded) version of Cyrano peformed back in 1958 by the Yale Dramatic Association. The recordings come from the first generation analogue copies of the lost master tapes.Perhaps an interesting show, but a little bit of a chore to listen to.The CD also contains extracts from Shire and Maltby's follow-up ay Yale, Grand Tour."
3,as good as I remember,"I had ther pleasure of playing Cyrano when the original cast album was only in vinyl. I am extremely happy to get it on CD. The melodies, soar and some of Maltby and Shire's best pieces reside in this work. I fyou are looking for something exciting for your theater group try this CD and see what all the fuss it about!"
3,"The shuttercock is very good at speed, but it is not that durable as I expected.","The shuttercock is very good at speed, but it is not that durable as I expected. I will need 2-3 for a 21-point game. This is the only thing I do not feel good, but it is important for feather shuttlecocks."
3,Trailer light kit came incomplete,"The product itself is Ok. The Trailer light fit perfectly in the base. The amber markers and reflectors did not come in the package. I had to purchase them separately even thought there were included in the offer. Other than that, the quality of the parts are Ok, but i think wesbar has a better finish in some of them."
5,One of my best buys from Amazon,"This CD is totally awesome. I got it for the soul purpose of Electric Prunes' song I had too much to dream last night. I found out that out of 18 songs, 16 are the best songs I/ve ever heard from the sixties. The Chambers Brothers' Time has come today is one of my fave's from this CD. There is a slight handicap on this album, numbers 9 and 10 are switched. This CD captures the great sounds of `60's punk rock and pshychedelic inspired rythm"
2,Good while it worked,"TV died a few days after delivery. Earliest warranty service was 10 days later. Service tech. comes out today. IF they have the parts, it SHOULD be back on line tonight. Watched Super Bowl on 13 inch portable...NOT HAPPY."
3,Starliner,Book was OK but there were some spelling errors that kind of bothered the continuity of some of the sentences
3,Starliner,"The premise is fantastic, but the weaving of the story is simplistic and undone. Could have been a great book otherwise."
5,Totally Camaro,"Hi-Tech Software must have Camaro fanatics on staff.Incredibly complete information on the life and times of the Heartbeat of America's four seater sports car. Did you know that GM produced a 90 minute movie, an off Broadway play and a line of clothing to promote the early Camaro? An early fastback version was mocked up but never produced to compete with the Mustang. These are some trivia but the 2002 Anthology contains 562 pictures, 13 movies (early commercials) and a plethora of details that will take many hours to explore by year or category. There's plenty more as well; I'm still looking it over. If there's one complaint I would have is the software interface feels a little dated but not enough to make it a disappointment. Besides all this, Amazon's price for this CD is a pittance to the F-body fan. I'm truly glad to have bought it!"
1,Don't believe all reviews are true!,"I bought the Canon S600 Printer 2 weeks ago and I'm not happy.1. It prints 1 PAGE OF TEXT IN 3 MINUTES (on parallel port) and 2.3 PAGES IN 1 MINUTE (on USB port), both in draft mode.2. Don't expect much help from Canon support technicians: they'll beat you around the bushes until you get sick and tired and give up any help. No return possibility or exchange with another printer is available from Canon.3. Don't expect to print more 218 text pages on 1 cartridge of black ink.4. Even my Lexmark Z11,Xerox and HP 600 printers are much faster.5. If you want to print in duplex mode, this one doesn't do it--you have to turn each page around by hand.6. The only good thing: the print and colors are significantly clearer than all other printers cited above.So, before bying a Canon printer, think minimum 5 times!"
5,Troubling Review,"Callahan will be troubling if you demand the latest and most expensive healthcare, even though the treatment will only extend your life a brief period-life at any cost! The author is not decrying medicine, health care, or related technologies. He does, however, state that other things to consider are the patient's age, the value of improving the person's quality of life, (is their condition terminal?), and financial costs to the patient and her family. For example, should an 85 year old person with a chronic heart condition be able to receive a heart transplant if it would only extend the patient's life a few months, and the surgery might actually kill the person?If a family member is in a ""consistent vegetative state"", should the family keep the body alive at all costs?Callahan asks hard questions and points out that there are no simple answers. This book is a great starting point for beginning a long overdue discussion on ethics and healthcare."
5,Progress,"Dr. Porter is clearly one of the biggest producers of modern scholarship for Biblical Greek and his Idioms books is much needed on every shelf of anyone interested in exegesis. The book is very classic in its easy layout and usability which serves to assist the beginner and make quick reference work for the experienced.One important note is that this book is not like other NT grammar books that beginning students own, this clearly fits a niche in one's library. The definitions and proposals are different than what is found in Wallace, Moule, or Mounce. Yet Porter writes and presents in a manner that makes it easy to learn and develop to the next level.Thanks Dr. Porter"
5,This is GREAT.....,I ordered this for my son. Who is 19 years old and a leader at Boy Scout Camp. They used this at camp for one week. It got a workout with 300 some boys playing with it. They had a competition at camp to see who's sling shot could throw a potato the farest. Guess what my son won. It is still in very good shape. My the kids use it in the back yard just to see how far it goes. My husband even loves it.
4,A fascinating but depressing book.,"This is a great book for those interesting in the struggles of Lake Victoria. It shows how the lake once was, and walks you through the history of it's downfall"
5,Great product!!,I use it everyday!! It is the best!! I definately recommend it. I haven't had anything since I started using this product.
5,Awesome product!,"This is an excellent lip balm that has the added benefit of eliminating cold sores. Since I began using this product, I've not had to deal with the recurring 'fever blisters' that were plaguing me. I keep several on hand (home, work, purse) and apply it often. It's a super moisturizing balm that's especially great for winter! In addition, I take the Super Lysine Plus vitamin supplement and couldn't be happier with the results of both!"
3,Error in Vendor Description,"This camera Model (IK-WB15A) does not have wireless like the vendor claims. The previous model to this the (IK-WB11A) which is now no longer made, had wireless.All in all not bad cameras, I have both, the WB11a and WB15a. Hunt around with the model number for the best deals."
2,Not My Favorite CD,"I think this album could have been better. Maybe they could have included at least one standard(i.e torch songs, anyone), and otherwise the songs are quite longish. This cd wins thumbs down for the longish feeling of the songs."
1,Hendrix isn't on this disk,Hendrix isn't on this disk. Hendrix and Little Richard didn't see eye to eye because both wanted to be the center of attention so Hendrix was fired. The songs here were recorded after Hendrix left the band. This is a rip-off for the money release only. Avoid at all costs.
4,Great workout,I love these dvds unfortunately i hate the 15 minute warmup. I wish all of the dvds included the full workout. But worth the money.
5,A must read for anyone who cares about children.,"As an educator on the South Side of Chicago, I found this book very enlightening.There are so many things children have to say to adults, but they so often gounheard. Here, these boys were able to be completely honest and open about theirexperiences in ""our country"". I believe this book will open anyone's eyes, andis a must read that will stay with you for a lifetime."
1,Silver bullets are for werewolves not software,If you enjoy spending an open ended amount of time trying out as many tricks as possible and seeing what sticks without any understanding of what you are doing or how long the effect will last then this book may be for you.Alternatively if you charge a lot by the hour and will benefit from as many return visits to a client as possible then this book is probably essential.
5,Mexican Train Set,After learning to play this game I had to have my own set. It is easy to store and all ages can play because dominoes are color coded. And it will never wear out and does not recquire batteries.
5,This game is awesome,I love this game. Very addicting and the product came brand new I believe. Very obvious it was first time opened which is great.
3,Same old story,"Same complaints as many others have. Mexican train is a very fun game for all ages but this particular set earned these minor complaints:1. The tin box is too large. The Dominoes swim around in this huge box. While it's cute they made it the shape of a train, I would rather a box that is easier to store and holds the dominoes securely.2. The battery operated train whistle went dead after exactly 3 whistles. That is okay since it was very loud, long, and annoying. I've read the batteries are at least $5 to replace so once you add that into the price, the set is no longer any deal.3. The dominoes themselves seemed a little cheap and I didn't like the colors used. I've seen worse and cheaper dominoes but these were disappointing. I'm going to keep on shopping and sell these on Ebay when I replace them."
4,Mexican Dominos with spice,"I have played a lot of Mexican Domino games with double 6 sets, but the addition of the playing pieces and the center starting platform (plus the double 9 domino set) really adds complexity and interest. I think it would be too difficult for children under say 12 years of age."
2,Disappointing Quality,"I was excited to receive this game after having played it for the first time a few nights ago and loving it. The game itself is fun, but the quality of this particular product was terrible, in my opinion. Everything appeared well packaged until I opened one of the plastic-wrapped sleeves of dominoes. Quite a few were chipped or had other very visible imperfections and almost all appeared dirty or scuffed. It looked like someone had already been using these dominoes (and not treating them very well) for a long time. Looking at the other shrink-wrapped dominoes I could see that they were all in this condition. I would have been mortified to give this as a gift. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but I'm not taking any more chances with this set."
4,Mexican train review,What a great game for both the young and old.It is a long game so make sure you give your self plenty of time.
3,Meh,"This book is an interesting read. Interesting enough to read all of the way through, but not enough to make me want to re-read it later. I probably won't purchase the sequels."
1,Plagiaristic twaddle,The authors plagiarised the Bradt Guide & should be sued for copyright infringement.
1,Very boring and highly derivative,"Having read this, it would appear that the authors have relied on old material - it is derivative and never helped me on my travels. Wherever I went in Myanmar, locals said ""Oh no, not the Lonely Planet - their information is all wrong. You want the Bradt guide""."
3,You can find better performances,"It is a good recording to have on hand because of it's rare compliation. However as some listeners have already noted, Midori lacks much depth in interpretation and tone. Many of the pieces were short and unmemorable. Presenting Joshua Bell and his Kriesler Album has a couple of pieces from this recording. You will be amazed to hear his abilities to shape and phrase which was something I didn't hear in Midori's drilled performances. I could never rate this as a favorite for the car or anywhere else, but it was a gift from a friend who shared similar sentiments. The value of this recording is wide reference to many standard violin recital pieces."
1,Sent Wrong Size!,I ordered boys Regular size 7 but I received a Slim size 5. Now I must send them back. Too bad because they look fine. I needed these in a hurry for an event and because the wrong item was sent it was all a wasted of my extra expense. Consequently I am very angry.
5,Astounding performance - opening the doors to Bach!,"Before the first time I heard Gould's first rendition of the Goldberg Variations, I used to think the music by Johann Sebastian Bach was too dry and intellectual and boring for my tastes (that was before discovering the excellent period-instrument performances) - but the lightning-fast, emotive, astounding rendition recorded by Gould made me reconsider that opinion. Yes, we hear his intrusive humming and the squeaking of the chair and such - that many consider a turn-off regarding Gould recordings - but I think they are part of the charm of the performance, and I don't find them distracting at all.I really prefer this version instead of the second Golberg recording, more calm and controlled. If you never heard any music from Bach, this is the recording to begin with, I think."
1,THE EMPORER'S NEW CLOTHES,"Idiosyncratic? Why does everyone use that word to describe Glenn Gould's playing? I find it cold and MECHANICAL - completely lacking in soul. I hear Superbly Controlled Note, Superbly Controlled Note, Superbly Controlled Note, Superbly Controlled Note...etc., etc... I could just as easily be listening to a sewing machine."
2,"""Portraits""","""Portraits"" indeed. There was not one portrait, either photographic or drawn. What a disappointment.I will look elsewhere next time."
4,nice shirt at a great price,Nice stretch shirt at a very nice price. Generous fit and long tails for wearing chest protector underneath. Open weave should make it cool in summer.
2,Drafting Stool,Looks nice but it is the bare bones. I went looking for a seat cushion for it and cannot find anything. I will kill your back and hips after a short while. Hard as rock and no support.
1,I bought 2 and had the same problem.,"I had the same problem as Sergey, except that the connection would work for a few minutes and then would shut itself off. Very poor product, compared to the WRT54GS with the High Gain Antenna (that's what I'm going back to). Don't waste your time or money on this surprisingly crappy product (strange, because Linksys products are usually pretty good)."
4,Final work from Emperor of music,"This sadly unrated cd is a gem within two major reasons: first,it has an perhaps one of the most oddest combinations of same work what comes to the instruments,Piano and Organ.Second:it contains Bach's last work,Contrapunctus XIV perfomed by the best one,Glenn Gould who plays the piece like it would be Bach himself in his last hours of life,so beautiful full of majastety it is.The Recording in a whole isn't perhaps the best example of sound quality,cause many of the Contrapunctus which are played in a piano,are quite old.Still,a must for Gould-lover are the Organ pieces which are unique from him and the glorious last contrapunctus which haven't met it's winner or honestly even competitor,despite numerous recordings for various instruments of it.i warmly recommend this,for anyone who understands Bach's beauty and Gould's unique interpreparation to it."
1,Dont be duped,"I bought this hoping for the original version found on Straight Outta Compton. I was hugely dissapointed when I discovered it was nothing more than a sorry excuse for a drum and bass remix. Could have been good, but whoever made it just stuck to the typical jungle formula and threw in some NWA samples.If it aint broke . . . Don't fix it!"
2,Was expecting more,"This is a two disk set with six episodes. The storyline really doesn't get off the ground and I can't say I overly enjoyed watching these OVA's. Most of the anime was well done. But really, spend your money elsewhere. :("
4,Great way to look up jokes,"This is a good reference book. The jokes cover everything you can think of. I cannot remember jokes for too long. So this book is a good way to help get out of crumby situations. Putting a smile on someones face, that is a little mad, is a good thing.That reminds me ""What was the first thing Adam said to Eve;""stand back - I don't know how big this thing gets"""
1,Unsuitable Jokes,"This book is full of filthy jokes that are inappropriate and impolite, especially for children. Don't buy it!"
4,"Direct from the *true* Kings of Comedy, the Joke Enclopedia!","I love this great big joke book! I got it for Christmas, and each night before turning out the light, I'd read sections of it, and really enjoy it. To tell the absolute truth, I was *very* suprised to find MANY of the jokes from my collection of ""Gross"" and ""Truly Tasteless"" books included here, albiet in slightly altered form. I suppose there's a place in the Friar's hearts for occasional filth and rauch. But you know what? I still love it! Hey, I said I was suprised, I didn't say I didn't approve. More power to 'em, so much the better, I say. Ranging in topics from Drugs, Sex, Work, Women, Doctors, Lawyers, (a rather BIG section there) and yes, even the ethnic jokes, I guarantee you'll find the catagory in here to suit your taste, and then you'll find the perfect joke to make you split your sides! Check this one out today!"
3,"Superlative Gould, but bad Bach.","Once again, David Hurwitz is pushing his personal agenda. Do NOT purchase these discs unless you already own several sets of the 48 and want a truly unorthodox view that belies the intent of the music. After staying away from Gould's interpretations of Bach's major keyboard works for some years, I recently decided to revisit them. Unfortunately, my impression of Gould's interpretations hasn't improved over the years. There is some incredible pianism on these CDs, and Gould's insights are often revealing. Nonetheless, the eccentricities and musical anomalies are too numerous and prohibitively distracting. What's more, the plaintive vocalizing is annoying, to say the least. This may be a must for Gould fans, but not for the rest of us. If you want something truly legendary in this repretoire, buy Edwin Fischer's classic recordings from the 30s. Or, if you want digital sound, Angela Hewitt's performances are beyond reproach."
1,Requires reseting switch every-so-often,"Have all my PC set to not sleep or have display sleep, even then every (approximately) couple months of regular use I have to power cycle the switch to get everything to work again. This seems to happen more frequently when I work from home (on major projects). Recycling the switch usually also requires me to hardboot or reset the PC so that I have keyboard/mouse/display control..."
4,Pretty cute!,I got this for my one yr olds play kitchens refrigerator. It's super cute and the eggs are wooden and sturdy. I do wish they were more white though cause to me they look more of a wood color. Very cute and I would recommend!
1,misleading,"A friend of mine brought this product before consulting me. If she had done so before, I would have told her to get six easter eggs stuff them with paper, bond them together and use a left over 6 count egg tray from her local grocery store. Total cost would have been less than $3.00 and you have six eggs to enjoy! This product is such a waist of money."
5,Poetic imagery combined with beautiful musicianship,"My entire family loves this CD. The tunes are catchy but the very clever lyrics are thought-provoking as well: ""Rise and shine, the night is gone and the sun (Son?) is shining in your eyes"". In classic folk-music style Andrew's lyrics lead one through a tale, with often startling connections: but more startling still is the purity of the musicianship, the obvious celtic influence, and the addition of interesting musical touches (inspired hammered dulcimer performances, steel guitar, fabulous Irish pennywhistle riffs). Every song on this album is excellent---not a dud among them. The fact that this is a Christian album, with praise to God in every song, is an extra added bonus. Andy and Gabe are extremely talented musicians, and wonderful in concert: I vastly prefer this album---professionally produced and augmented by many excellent musicians---over Andy's first album ""Walk""."
2,hum hum hum,This could be a fantastic album but Gould's humming and other strange noises make it close to impossible to relax and enjoy it.
1,Overpriced,Go to the manufacturer of the robot to buy this. It's almost half the cost there. How can someone get away selling this kit for so much?
1,Scooba Replenish Kit,"I was very disappointed in this item. The replacement brush is of very poor quality. It has very short bristles and they are too few and far apart. The other items are fine, but I will have to buy a replacement brush from IRobot."
3,Interesting technique,This really does work but you should do it everyday for about 3 weeks to see your results. It only takes 15 minutes so it's not a time stealer. This technique has been around for many years but Greer was the only one that I've found to bring it to the states in a program. It's fairly easy to do and how it works makes sense once you hear the explanation in the intro. Greer comes on HSN and promotes this program once a year. Definitely worth a try!
1,Papermate --- REALLY,"I opened the box of 12 Papermate pens, took one out and couldn't click for operation. The second worked and retracted --- it was the only one out of 12. I took them apart, soaked the barrels in ""Simple Green"" and then used a tiny brush to get the caked ink out. Was it Papermate, heat, altitude or storage that caused the problem. I don't know but mine work now!"
3,Spotty,"An inconsistent offering. Two or three of the tracks on this CD are excellent, but taken together its hard to determine what the thematic elements are. The dancehall meets house fusion is a good idea, but as is typical a formula isn't enough to build compelling music. The quality of the material just isn't there.Additionally the mix on this album is almost unlistenable in my car. The bass is overly prominent."
1,Brendas review,"The guy was all over the place with his stories seems he wanted to tell a story and then make it fit. Also would'nt hurt to simplify, some of the greatest writers in history got there point across speaking simply.."
4,A powerful spritual truth,"This book reflects well a great deal of the journey I've travelled and the things that have been taught to me through painful experience, open and honest discussion with spritually focused friends, and oodles of diverse theological and spiritual readings and studies.It captures wonderfully many of my sentiments and much wisdom. I highly recommend it."
2,Be careful of hardware conflict,I have bought this product 6 months back. But I found it really difficult to install it on my PC. Picture freezes after 5 minutes. That's it! I talked to customer support many times. They asked me to talk to my PC company to resolve the hardware conflict. I need to change some card or something which I don't want to do. Picture quality is really great!.
4,"Kodak DVC325 - Great Color quality, but lack movements","The Kodak DVC325 camera captures great color among other cameras. Probably the far best in colors, because it produce great vibrant color (see link for image quality comparison: .... The only problem I have with this camera is the lack of mobility from left-to-right. It only tilt up and down of a tilt range of up to 75 degrees. See Kodak's site for more info: ....I still rank it 4 stars, because of the high quality of the images captured."
1,Does not work with Windows XP,"I read countless web sites describing how to install this camera on Windows XP and followed every one of them. Even though XP recognizes that there is a device there, it does not work. You get a blank screen. Kodak blames the motherboard. The motherboard company blames Kodak. When I plug it into a Win2000 box, presto, perfectly working camera. I have read other reviews that say they got it to work with XP, but many more that had problems. If you run Windows XP, you are taking a gamble buying this camera."
5,Nice little unit,"Great little thermometer for B&W.; Do not even think about using this for color. For color, get an accurate digital or at the very least, a calibrated mercury thermometer.For what this unit was made for, it is a nice little unit that doesn't break the bank. I bought several.ADT"
2,No Video,"Got this to run my home PC and work laptop. I just got a new PC, Windows 7 Pro,and LCD monitor with DVI-D connection cable. My laptop is running Windows XP. My monitor resolution is set at 1920X1080 @ 60Hz. The only thing that worked was the USB mouse and keyboard. Contacted Avocent and was told to try a 4:3 ratio monitor and test the resolution at 1024x768@60hz. This did not work and it is not acceptible to step down on the monitor."
1,Complete garbage,"I took McCovey Chronicles for a short spin last year and I can tell you from experience, it's complete garbage. The site is run by people who have absolutely no knowledge of baseball or the San Francisco Giants. Most of the time, the articles and subsequent commentary from the 7 or 8 ""regulars"" who want to be part of something bigger than their own useless lives, have nothing to do with baseball. Instead, I have noticed a lot of commentary about video games, Asian women, and eggrolls. Real childish stuff. In fact, there's a lot of Giants-bashing that goes on there from so-called Giants fans. They're pretty much just a bunch of bitter people using the Internet to get attention. I wouldn't pay a penny for this service, let alone 99 of them.p.s. Read my blog."
3,Need to put energy into it to enjoy it,"Its a good size. the sound is almost clear.The problem is that it doesnt go off on its own. You have to push a button thats on the back.Says bunch of pharses but the fact of constantly pushing the button, makes you not wanna play whole alot with it. If you want to collect it then get it. If you want to spend your $30ish on something usefull or fun then dont get it."
3,Durable and cute,"I really like these dolls, but the sad fact is that my kids don't. I bought them to go with the Plan chalet doll house and my girls just didn't like playing with them. I bought them because they're made from wood, cloth and braided cord - very durable and much better than plastic or vinyl. But they largely sit on the side while the girls use polly pockets with the house. *sigh*"
3,Stargaze HD,"Impressive DVD, but not as good as Stargaze (the best) and Stargaze II. The commentary on Stargaze provides the viewer excellent info on size, location, and distance from earth/our solar system; the ""location feature"" of Stargaze II provides the same excellent info(BUT, without commentary). I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ""A STARGAZE III DVD (WITH LATEST VIEWS & COMMENTARY) OF THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE'S ""VIEWS/DISCOVERIES"" SUBSEQUENT TO STARGAZE & STARGAZE II DVDS."
3,First Steps in Enameling,"This book has pretty good information if you are a beginner. I took a class and the teacher recommended this book, which is why I bought it. I have to admit that I have another book I like much better."
5,Simple product that works,"I use it when I'm sitting around at home (e.g. while watching TV) and find that this works to strengthen my wrists and forearms. You can really feel the burn, especially at high reps."
4,Best MURS base you can buy thats fully legal,"At least to my knowledge. With only a wire Jpole antenna ( Thats inside) I have spoken to friends over seven miles away clearly!Now Remember I am higher then they are, Much higher. I ordered a 5/8's wave antenna for the roof. This should give me much greater range . I love these simple to use transmitters and plan on buying two HT's when I have the extra cash. Even my 3 year old neice has figured out how to answer me when away from home. So I am betting the wife can also :)"
4,Good Addition,Good addition to the cookbook shelf for those who appreciate putting a meal together quickly! Simple and tasty is the goal!
5,A true original,"I always thought ""Wildman"" was just an act. This provocative documentary shows that Larry was truly crazy. Worth viewing even if you never heard of Wildman Fischer."
1,reject,"I very much wanted this product to work, but alas, it's going back. The unit has a mind of it's own, turning itself on and off by itself....a very unpleasant feature."
2,Operational Review,"Everything on the unit works well except the digital display. The display lights up but shows no information. With that, there is no way to use the radio, clock, or timer functions. I will be returning this unit for replacement. Installation, mounting, and manual were understandable and straight forward. Mounting template was accurate. Includes manuals and templates in 3 languages. Includes all hardware needed for installation, batteries for the remote, and extension mounts for cabinets with a non-flush cabinet bottom. Does not include RG-6 COAX or RGB cables. Does include FM antenna. Has one 90deg RG-6 adaptor for sharp turns. Unit is silver."
4,thank God enzyme clkeaning tablets still available,"oh yeah..if u wear lenses,,,u do need to deproteinise them after every 15 wears... and regardless of what the eyewear companies tell u...the liquids dont work even 20 % as well as tabletsI live in Mumbai, India... and wear various coloured lenses which are powered ... for aesthetic looks as well as eye sight... and the tablets are not available in IndiaUsed to search for them whenever i went abroad... and hioarded them when i found them at shops in Dubai and Singapore...Now thankfully i can order them here.. and yes these tablets are efficient"
5,dorinda's secret big hit with me !,"Me being a Cheetah Girls reader since book one, I know what a good Cheetah Girls book is and trust me on this one, this is a great book! This book focuses on the group member named Dorinda, who is a foster child. Can she have family somewhere?"
1,Worst CD of the century!!!,"The name of the CD, Blues Juice, really fools people into thinking maybe this is a CD of blues. It's not even a CD of country music. It's probably the worst ""elevator"" music I've ever heard and the biggest waste of anyone's time. I would have liked to have known it was the biggest rip off in music history before I purchased it."
4,The Doolittle Raids,An excellent example of history being much more captivating than fiction. You can't make this stuff up! Deals with the Doolittle raid over Tokyo early in WWII when the US desperately wanted to strike back at Japan before we were in a position to do so. A tale of incredible daring and sacrifice. A great read.
2,It just wasnt good,"Typically I don't critique. That just isn't my thing, but this movie is a bit of a fixer upper. Plot is flat and so are the leading characters. They clip in and out of scenes, event leading to an answer to the many questions that may pop into your head will always be cut out at the last second, and the emotional connection between Rag and Tag is so undeveloped that it's actually hard to tell if/when feelings actually occurred. The movie had prospect, but failed in the carry out."
5,Essential Nancy,"Contains all the original hits from 1965 - 8, omitting only a handful of low charters. Good sound quality and liner notes. The only Nancy Sinatra you need."
1,blarg.,"These things aren't any better than the stock iPod headphones. Uncomfortable, crappy quality, and they seem flimsy. Definitely wouldn't recommend these things. Spring the extra $20 for some Sennheisers or something."
3,Not different with fit; better sound,"I bought these ear buds after reading other reviews on Amazon. I was hoping that they would stay in my ears better than the factory ear buds that came with my MP3. it turns out that they do not stay in my ears any better. However, the sound is better in these."
2,Great for a while -- faulty earbud?,"These were fantastic for the few months they lasted until they just up and half-died. I would rather them fully die, but in fact, one of the ear buds doesn't work while the other one is just fine. Makes for some awkward listening. If yours were great, I am glad that you may have been lucky enough to have a non-defective pair. If not for their falling into disrepair, I would've been happy with them. However, even when they were good, I wished that they had greater ability to block out other sound. Because they fit loosely in the ear, other sounds can easily penetrate. This is good or bad, depending on your needs. If you're happy with the price, you will be happy with this as you pay for what you get... but don't expect a miracle for this price."
3,not big enough,The price is right but the diameter is too small for big people. They need to have a size that is an inch or two wider.
2,Great Artist - My Fault,"I should have known by the shoulder pads..... She has an awesome voice, but the songs are 80's pop laim. Yikes, I missed this one by a mile, I was looking for R&B Soul but Amazon did not offer the ability to listen to any tracks like they do for so many others."
4,really good book,"if you want action,money,etc.. this book provides it all.anything goes&Yet you are wonder what might happen next in certain parts of the Book.this is the Kind of Book that if Donald Trump was a Film Director He would try to create&Make.the Rich&The Powerful always make a Good Read at any cost."
4,The best Cure performance on screen. VCD format sux,"I love this performance, as they play all their best old songs over the course of almost two hours! I had the tape for years but wanted something more permanent, so I got the VCD which, as advertised, is supposed to play on dvd players. Wrong! It doesnt play on new or old ones. I can only watch it on my computer with a movie player program. Thats fine, but now I have to park my ass in front of the computer instead of relaxing in front of my Tele. For that reason alone I give the VCD only 4 stars. The Cure's performance in Orange to this day is simply, Amazing, Haunting, and Stellar. Forever immortalized on screen."
2,unexpectedly expected,"read some of the review about the blue tooth, but wanted to try with my handheld anyways. Purchase this and wound up getting version 2007 plus of street atlas... for some reason (I guess the box) I was expecting 2008. Like most reviewers, I've got a previous version on my pc along with the LT version of the gps device. I've got a more up to date, yet still outdated version of the streets, and a poor excuse for a handheld gps... can't go outside of downloaded maps....IT sucks.. not lemons, but maybe lemonheads, but i expected that."
1,Listen to regular folks who actually use the product,"I have two TomToms, but was looking for something that I could plan for the next day's trip on a larger screen, like a laptop. I thought this was the product for me. After reading the reviews of users of this product, I wil stick to the awkward touchstreen of my TomToms. Thanks for the great headsup!Harley Jones"
4,Different,"I enjoyed ""The Ignored"". It's plot was like nothing I've ever read before. I never knew what crazy thing would happen next.Bentley Little has a very good imagination!"
4,Made you think about yourself...Are you Ignored?,"This book started off so good I could not put it down. Then when you kind of figured out the story it became a little too long. 50 less pages would have been a perfect book.It was scary how some of the things he was saying was so close to the truth in everyday life.The ""other world"" seemed to be added in there for no reason-it did not give you a reason what it was or why it was there.Thats one of the problems I have with his books-the set up is so good and keeps moving along good until the final twenty pages.He knows how to start these books great but not come up with a satisfying conclusion.Still a good read-is not boring-give it a try."
2,Very Basic,After the previous glowing reviews of this book I bought it hoping to get some special insite in OO. If you have any experience with VB.NET this is just a review. I have gleened much deeper conceptual understaning of OO from fellow programmers. If you are brand new to VB.NET this might be an OK book. I was dissappointed in the lack of depth.
2,This Ball is just OK!,"I purchased this ball for my volleyball husband for fathers day. It is just ok. I think it is smaller than the standard volleball size. We have an old ball that we use to play with during our sand volleyball days that we loved and this ball was much smaller than our old ball. It's not as soft as I thought it would be but that may also be because it is still new. Anyway, I gave it a 2 because I felt it was too hard and smaller than a normal or standard size vball. It was just ""OK"""
2,"Imperfect, not round. Do not waste your money on this one!","For almost 30USD, you get a ball that is not even round. I bought this to play on grass. Tachikara makes good indoor game balls, but not outdoor balls."
5,Classic w/ Captioning,"Before you purchase this remote for use with Canon's Classic Sureshot 120, make sure you have the ""caption"" model. This remote will not work with the standard 120."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I have had this vaccum for about a year and a half now. I bought it in a pinch. This thing has completely lost all suction , I see things on my carpet and I go over them again and again to see if she picks them up and nope!!! With two kids and three cats in the house I need to vaccum alot and it is just not doing the job. I wish I could afford a new one :( It is heavey and awkward, and the belt has also burnt up on me several times. I do like the attachment tube, and thats about it."
2,"Great Story, poorly written","I love LeRoy Butler. He is one of my favorite Packers ever. I have heard his story on tv and through various internet articles, so I thought I would purchase his book, as I purchase most Packers books I come across. His story is very inspiring. Although, to be quite honest, the book is pretty poorly written. It doesn't flow very well, I thought I was reading something I wrote in middle school. He spends 2/3 of the book on his childhood and then briefly touches on his career at FSU and Green Bay. I am not disappointed in my purchase, but it could have been written better. Go Pack!"
1,You are all dumb,This DCD was the least exciting CD they have ever made. It lacks the original style and grace of the true DCD. If this was the first DCD album I would stop listening to them right this second. These words do not come close to the disappointment i felt after I bought this album. You should avoid this album if you know what good music is. Thank you for listening to me and hope yu learn your lesson.Squishyb
1,Not big deal...just noise,"YES, the voice of Lisa Gerrard is beautiful BUT can't be appreciated in this boring disc. Some sounds and nice, but the way in which they mixed them.....It's just noise. They tried to make an ""ethnic"" disc but they failed. I repet by buying this disc.Luis"
4,"The ""least dry"" Schoenberg ever","I believe wholeheartedly that, for the uninitiated, this disc is difficult to truly appreciate without having heard other pianists attempt these pieces (e.g., Pollini). To enjoy listening to Schoenberg necessitates a certain familiarity with prolonged ""dissonance"", just like strong coffee or unfiltered beer--it takes some getting used to. If you're already there, it's not ""dissonant"", it's ""music"" (just like other alternate melodic conceptions-raga, gamelan, mbira, partch, etc.), and Gould's passionate readings here display his love for and understanding of the music's heart. Go Glenn."
4,Practical Help For The Christian Wife,This book by Beverly LaHaye though written some years back has some practical help for the Christian woman to be what God has called her to be. The book begins by giving the 4 basic temperaments of women and some character traits and positives and negatives of each temperament. This allows us to see our strengths and our weaknesses so that we can work with the Holy Spirit to become Christlike. The book covers many areas of how a wife needs to interact with her husband and her attitude toward him. There is also insight and some instruction for growing spiritually. This book is helpful to the Christian wife.
4,Great collection of all the best hits,"If you like Southside Johnny but don't own any cd's, this is the one to get. All of the great singles are here. This CD will have you dancing and singing along with Southside. A great underrated band with many of the songs written by Springsteen and Miami Steve Van Zandt."
4,Harder Work than Usual,"I was disappointed in this book partly because my expectations of Robin Hobb are so high. Her characterisations are excellent, her plots full and thought provoking. She writes with a passion, and makes you think about your own assumptions and actions.But in this book, Nevare Burvelle IS Fitzchivalry Farseer. The protaganists are so similar that it quite spoiled the book. Both are procrastinators. Both are cursed with an unacceptable magic. Both are forced to break all ties with their family and end up being believed dead by the ones they love. Both share a similar morality. The list goes on. Robin Hobb has simply recreated a character that she lovingly brought to a conclusion once before.I still enjoyed the book enough to read it and the next one. But this will not be one of my all time favourites - unlike her previous works."
3,Just OK,"So far this trilogy is not as good a read as the Farseer or Tawny Man series. Too much repitition with no payoff as a literary device, Nevare is just a little too slow in realizing his potential, and there are too many long periods in which he marks time. Others talk about Robin Hobb's ability to create cultures, however, there are really only two masters at that: Tolkien and LeGuin. That said, I rated this a 3 rather than a 2 because I have enjoyed this well enough so far to keep reading."
3,"Good book, not very enjoyable","I love Ms. Hobbs' writing, and although this was a good book, I really didn't enjoy it much. I usually like books to brighten my day at some point, but this entire book was low key, with many `bad things' happening, and very few times when you felt good.Even in tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, there are great ""ups"" to contrast and magnify the tragic ending. Forest Mage was pretty much all a plodding ""down""There weren't any characters that were especially likable in this story, even the characters that you came to like in the first book were made fallible and their bad sides were brougt to the forefront in this one. Any successes or victories for the characters must be coming sometime in a future book (which I'm sure I WILL buy)."
1,Worse than the first,"The first book had the small benefit of leaving hope that a plot would eventually start to evolve or at least characters would become interesting to the reader. After the first 100 pages of the second book in the series it's obvious that this is going nowhere. Beware the 5 star reviews who admit ""its slow, but...""Its tedious...period."
2,Very disappointing!,Definately not up to the standards that her previous books have set. The story was intriguing but the entire series seemed to drag on and on and on! Could have done this easy in two books.
4,Forest Mage IS A Serious Book,This book is serious fiction. It deals with some very difficult issues in an interesting if not entertaining way. A great writer will sometime make a difficult subject easy to read. Hobb is a good writer so the story sometimes seems hard to read. This is not a book to take to the beach but it is a very important book and well worth reading. .
4,Cute little book,Cute book. Very funny and insightful. Helped me figure out that my neighbor was gay. I shared it with him. We both had a good laugh.
2,Flimsy clip frustrates,"The pen is fine, functions well and has the same great feel I've loved in the PHD pen. HOWEVER, the clip part is made of cheap stamped 'metal' and quickly was bent out away from the barrel of the pen. Small needle nose pliers couldn't really return it to the right position. This meant that it wouldn't clip securely and felt awkward in the hand. They need to spend a couple of pennies more on beefing that clip up.I won't buy another."
2,pen gave out very quick no refil available,like the ergonomics but the pens give out and parker does not have a refil availble
2,Deceiving picture,I didn't realize it was just a thick piece of plastic. I'm not a candy mold expert but I'm not sure this will stand up to high temperatures of heat...we were hoping to make crayon molds with it. But for a couple dollars I'm sure it is just fine.
1,Too basic for even a beginner,"If you're trying to sew fashionable clothes, even basic clothes, this isn't the book for you. There's no instructions on sewing with zippers or buttons - two major fundamentals. Waste of money. I do like the spiral binding, though."
5,Sewing 101,Excellent book. It is being used for a Domestic Arts class in a small Christian Classical school and works quite well.
3,too simple,"I thought from previous reviews that I would learn something from this book, even though I have a little bit of experience, but it is very very basic. I would only recommend if you have absolutely no experience with sewing of any kind. I will say that I like the binder, which is very easy to have open when using it while working."
2,"First 50 pages good for techniques, but after that...","I am new to sewing and received this as a gift. I liked the first 47 pages...it is an overview of basic techniques, some which were good review and others that were new to me. I enjoyed that aspect of it. The projects after the techniques were outdated and uninspiring. Clearly, projects from the early 90s - one ""shirt"" that was more like a hospital scrub had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toy in the pocket. While I'm not the coolest most hip person, I would not make the shirts, elastic waist skirts, and elastic waist pants that are shown in this book. I don't know how or if they can be updated to be more modern. I would of been happen just to get the first 47 pages."
4,Very Helpful for Absolute Beginner,This book was recommended by several folks on a sewing forum so I ordered it. It really is a great book for beginners. i had no prior sewing experience and found it easy to understand and follow. I definitely recommend this book.
4,"ok for absolute beginners, but could use more detail","This is a very, very basic book for absolute beginner sewers. It seems deliberately simplified, perhaps to avoid scaring newbies. It's very heavy on pictures, and very light on explainations or details. For example, it shows pictures of a few common types of fabric, but doesn't say anything about why you would pick one over another, what stiches to use on each, what ironing heat or steam setting to use on each, or how to clean them."
5,Fast service,"I ordered on a wednesday, it arrived via UPS on a thursday afternoon, all the way from Connecticut to Philadelphia, even though I didn't expect rush shipping. I was pleased with the speed with which it arrived.It was packed to survive anything -- very securely packed.All was as expected.Only downside is the transformer is manufactured in China."
3,Itom Was Not As Expected:,"I Purchased This Itom Thinking It Was A Whistle I Could Wrap Around My Wrist. (From The Images, Thats What It Looks Like) When The Itom Arived, The Wrist Strap Was Way Too Big, And There Was No Way I Could Adjust It To Fit My Wrist. I Had To Cut The Strap On It To Shorten It And Purchase Extra Velcro To Fasten It. I Have Ordered Other Products From Fox 40 Before And They Have Always Met With My Aproval, This One Didnt."
5,Very Nice Modern Lieder. Buy It.,"'Lieder' by Arnold Schoenberg is packaged in such a way that one would think the composer is Glenn Gould, and not the Viennese master of 12 tone theory.This reminds me of how much of a Wunderkind Gould was back in the 1960s. It seems he was to classical music performing and recording what Emeril Lagasse is to culinary endeavors.But, I do not say this to warn you off this recording. On the contrary, this is an excellent collection of pieces, which have few hints of 'impressionistic' or ultramodern stylings. In fact, when the first CD starts out, I find the songs remarkably similar in feel to some of George Gershwin's songs in 'Porgy and Bess'. This impression doesn't last, but the sense that Schoenberg has brought something fresh to the Lieder persists throughout the work. After listening to a big helping of Wolf's lieder, I find Schoenberg a pleasant return to the lyricism of Shubert, with just a touch of modern flavoring.Very worthwhile for Lieder fans."
4,Desk Lamp is Perfect,"This Adjustable Desk Lamp fits perfectly at the desk in our kitchen and matches the stainless steel applicances we have. The light is perfect for computer work, paying bills, etc. Really good value as the lamp looks more expensive than it really is!"
1,Water clarifier,Total waste of money it will actually make your water worse. This product should be refined to better quality. I would not recommend this product.
4,Just fine for the beginner,"I have to disagree with the several reviewers who state this is not for the beginner. I think it is well suited for any one interested in the subject. Although I feel I had a pretty good grasp of M.T. before buying this, I also think Latarski starts at the beginning in a way someone new to MT can understand. Come on people! Music Theory is NOT all that esoteric. If you graduated from High school, you should beable to understand this. I have not yet used the CD's, so no comment on thier usefulness. Don't know. But the written material is NOT too difficult for any one with average intelligence to understand. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!! I rated it 4 stars because i have not read the entire book, nor used the CD's. Could be 5, not sure yet."
1,broke after 1 week,"This camera worked for a week then broke. The place I bought it didn't accept open box returns. I emailed Epson and they said to take it to a store 300 MILES away. I suggested that was absurd. A few emails later I got instructions to call a toll long distance number for Support and that Epson would pay shipping (but I had to call, not email). After waiting on hold for a few minutes a rep. had me try a few things then suggested I take it to a store 300 MILES away. Great. So I told them about the email and the rep. put me on hold for another 5 minutes (while the toll charges racked up). Nothing but pass-the-buck. Reminds me of Tommie Boy when Chris Farley's character says to the sceptical buyer, ""I can s**t in a box and put a warranty on it if it'll make you feel better.""Don't buy from Epson."
3,Decent little tool until it rusts,"Nice little tool. Scissors and blade were sharp and the screwdriver has come in handy. However, the thing quickly became rusted and very hard to open and close. I do not remember ever getting the tool very wet, certainly I never left it out in the rain or dropped it into water or anything like that, but it is now quite rusty. Probably a good idea to save your money and buy yourself a little larger tool that will stand up better to rust."
4,The Perfect Lamp,"this is the lamp for anyone with a dimly lit work space. its adjustable, making it perfect for any situation. i found fault only with its tendency to fall over in certain configurations, but that was easily fixed. i would greatly recommend this lamp!"
3,Thin on plot but rich in taste!,"I'm not sure how appropriate this book is for the under-fourteen set. It seems the author had 82 Gremlins, because the drawings are all in marker and the plot has too many twists and turns. While this may seem like a fine how-do-you-do to most, other may see it the other way, or maybe not.Color Harmony is bound, it has pages, it has both a back and a front cover, so I have to give it a sterling, or at least a pound, like with a mallet. 5 o'clock shadow is just the sort of thing to make you feel warm, but if your desk is tidy, you might not notice the squid.Overall, detournement is humorous and does something, even if its effects don't strike you until much later. Color terrorists and small snails should beware!"
5,Meeee-oooooooooooooooooow!,These toys are soft and adorable! On top of that you're giving them a real star! How cool is that? Half of my grandkids are now planning to be astronauts! They use the Nasa site to check on their stars and usually end up widening their search. The teens and preteens really enjoy the game site. In addition to all this a portion of the profits goes to children's charities. I have rarely been happier with a gift I've purchased.
3,Comprehensive Overview,"Though I'm not an ardent EH fan, I respect her for the integrity of her music; she never seems to play it safe just to be commercial. She sounds best with strong production, as is evident on songs like ""Heartbreak Hill"" and ""Heaven Only Knows,"" and worst when she fails to enunciate her words. Overall, this is a good collection, particularly if you don't already own her two previous ""Profile"" albums. Regrettably missing is her hit duet with Earl Thomas Conley, ""We Believe In Happy Endings."""
2,"Skimpy on problems, no solutions, inconsistent tone","I am currently using this book for a third semester physics class. The tone of the book is all over the place - sometimes conversational and sometimes very academic, which makes it hard to read. There are not enough sample problems in the text to demonstrate even a small selection of the questions at the end of each chapter. The answers to the odd questions are sometimes strangely wrong (i.e. for a problem about Anna and Bob, answers were given for Bob and Al. Who's Al? At least the numbers were right.) There are no answers to the even questions. There are no solutions in the book and a separate solutions manual is not available even for the odd questions.I gave this 2 stars instead of just 1 because some of the relativity examples are different than the typical explanations in other books, which gives students more than one explanation to learn from. But this is a skinny book that seems to cost quite a bit and lacks in several areas."
5,Review from Prometheus,"""Metcalfe's book is an excellent reference for those students having difficulty getting their research started...By orientating the researcher's mind to what tehy really want to say and how they are going to say it, Metcalfe provides them with the confidence to venture into such areas. In terms of recommending a research methods text to new researchers, Business Research Through Argumetn by Mike Metcalfe represents a very safe choice."""
3,OK for light use,"Problem with these all all space bits is that they use carbon tool steel which is the softest metal used for cutting tools They are not terrible in soft woods like fir or pine but dull very fast in hard woods or MDF/particle board. The 1/4"" shank is also too small and will twist out of shape if used with a corded 1/2"" drill.If you need to use space bits the ones from Bosch work a lot better. The Bosch spade bits have a unique design that helps to keep them cutting straighter into the wood.Bosch Daredevil DSB5005 7-Piece Spade Bit Set With Extension"
3,"Half Good, Half Bad","As an avid TMBG fan, I eagerly awaited the release of this book. While I do not regret my purchase, the book is not as useable as I had hoped.The first two songs with this book go painfully slow. The pages of illustrations for this part of the book must keep your child's attention for over a minute.The second two songs of the book, ""Idlewild"" and ""Bed, Bed Bed"", go much quicker and are better able to hold a child's attention, though it can go a bit too quickly at times and can be difficult to turn the pages in time to the music.There are no indications for when to turn the page, so this is not an independent reading book for a young child.The music is great, though, and the illustrations are charming. A definite must-have for any TMBG fan."
2,Can't Wear This!,"No doubt, Madame Rochas is a great fragrance in the classic style. However, the aldehydes were far too much for me to handle. Even with a light spray and a mist walk-through, aldehydes are all I smelled for a couple hours. Aldehydes, coupled with white florals, can be especially problematic for me, and Madame Rochas is another is a long list of Aldehyde Florals that I've tried and can't wear.I've never smelt the original, and apparently the new formula is the victim of cost-cutting. If so, I can see why."
4,It is a steal,"I compared the price for this proudct in other local stores it was double the price that i had paid through Amazon.com, my wife loved it for it's qualityher mother used it when she was young till now.It is a steal , we recommend buy it."
3,Interesting,"An interesting, somewhat facinating read, however I felt the author could have delved a little into scientific research -- reads more like a Hollywood script than an informative book."
5,Beautiful and a great resource!,"This calendar is really unique, it includes a remarkable number and a very wide range of events, from food & wine to music, cinema, horticulture, art, fashion and more. I can't imagine an easier way to be be in the know about all these events, particularly early enough that you can actually plan to attend! I like that the phone numbers are included and even more so that you can go the web site for links to events. Great seasonal photos."
1,Quality check needs improvement,When I received this book It was put in backwards and upside down between the book covers. I was looking at this book for a class I teach but I'm not taking the chance that these books will also arrive incorrectly bound. The content is a bit dated. ( This book was bought through Amazon)
2,This [...] used copy will be a collector's item!,"[ The clever Mr. Clinton knew he could not get the big bucks for simply spouting a lot of earnest policy palaver, as he did in his 1996 ""Between Hope and History,"" reviewing lessons learned in his presidency and offering his vision of opportunity, responsibility and community. The book tanked, and is out of print. [....]][....]"
1,Nothing whatsoever to do with the Easter Bunny!,"I believe that the reviews associated with this listing are for Here Comes Peter Cottontail, not this animation. This DVD is an animated cartoon about a bunny named Peter who is given the responsibility by the mother rabbit to watch his four sisters. Peter disregards every instruction his mother gives him and gets into a lot of trouble. This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Easter Bunny. I feel that the title of this DVD is extremely misleading and the only reason I bought it was because of the supposed Easter theme. This being said, my 2 and 4 year old girls loved hopping around the room as they watched this cartoon."
2,Really Annoying,"I found this movie to be really annoying. The voices are horrible. But, my 4 year old daughter really enjoys it and has since she first got it on her 1st Easter. My advice if you buy this is to put it on when you don't have to be in the room to hear it."
1,Zero stars isn't possible,"This is the equivalent of your friend typing a few pages, stapling it together and charging you $30. This is WAAAAY overpriced and very misleading as one of the other reviews says, this is NOT a paperback. It's just paper."
5,Great Camera & Easy to Use,"Just got this camera a couple of days ago. I liked the camera because it was lightweight and compact. I have a 35mm Nikon and wanted a smaller camera to carry around for on the spot picture taking. Decided to go digital. The picture quality on this cameria is clear and crisp. I especially like the Adaptive Lighting feature where the camera balances the lighting across the whole picture.It has great video capabilities with smooth streaming. The remove red eye feature is also a plus and works well.The camera is very easy to use with an intuitive menu system. Finally, I really like the look a feel with the silver face and rubberized back. I would definitely recommend this camera. It was definitely the best buy for the quality and price."
5,Nice compact case for your small camera,"I use to have another case from Canon that had an extra pouch for extra CF memory cards, but this leather case just gets to the point. Leather case for the small camera and the camera only so no extra space. Hope that made sense, but yes, I recommend this case."
3,"Nice book, but missing a lot.","This is a nice coffee table book, but leaves out the vast majority of South America. I could not believe Rio de Janeiro and other major places where not listed. Could be a bit more extensive."
4,Where is EUCLID?,"I know little about the period the book covers so I am in no position to comment on accuracy. After all, this is why I bought the book - to learn something about antiquity. It was easy to determine in the shop where I purchased it that it was an easy read: furthermore it was bargain priced. I am surprised however that there is no mention of the mathematician Euclid whose famous work helped to shape future mathematical reasoning for centuries. His fifth postulate, in one form or another, is known by most people with a reasonable high school education and commanded the attention of many future, famous mathmaticians. The impact and influence of Euclid's work, socially, culturally and intellectually is undisputed yet Cantor leavers him out - a serious omission. In spite of this I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading his ""The Civilization of The Middle Ages""."
1,Interesting and easily read but...,"I picked up this book at the bookstore while purchasing another book I had planned to get. I had recently finished another book on ancient civilization which I had enjoyed so thought I would try another. Now, you must understand that I am hardly a born again anything but when the author blithely states that the exodus never occurred and that Paul made up the whole resurrection of Jesus story without any explanation for his conclusion, I am somewhat taken aback."
5,Are you Serious???,"I Read this book for a humanities class years ago in my first year of college. This book is a simple read that gives YOUNG readers i.e. high school and college kids a chance to lean about the history of these cultures and not want to kill themselves. I have read a few of Cantors books and yes it's a little simple but that's his style!!!!!! For the KIDS!!!! Every review bags him because it's so simple and not sophisticated in its wording, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOUNG READERDS! So please do us all a favor and go back to starbucks and read some poetry. Oh and all the questions statements about his history being wrong. Are you serious????? He is a Ny Times bestseller!!!!! I think he has had a person or two check the history!!!!!!!!"
3,"An enjoyable, if superfluous book","As usual, Norman Cantor has produced an enjoyably readable survey here. This is an excellent read if deep concentration is impossible, say while traveling, for the material can be detailed or complex at times, Cantor's style makes it accessible without delving too deeply. Despite the main ""Cantorisms"" prevalent throughout the book, there are several parts that are quite good, especially his synthesis of Judaism. In truth, it feels like an abbreviated fling through a collegiate survey of western civilization course. To see Cantor really shine, however, do be sure to read his more medieval-centered works."
4,Good Starter Acoustic Great Price,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who wanted to learn how to play guitar. As a musician I took it upon myself to gift him this instead of his parents spending a lot of money on an instrument he may only look at. Once it arrived I set it up for him and played it a bit, well a few songs, and I was impressed. It had a great tone that really impressed me. The fit and finish was fantastic. I was worried that due to the low cost their would be some major cosmetic blemishes or even a crooked neck but it came near perfect.Pros: Cost! The price point at which I purchased this was the same as the really cheap acoustics. It has a great tone.Cons: Nothing much really in regards to the price point. Obviously you want to put on quality strings, eventually. But starting out learning, these will hold up good.So if you want a decent guitar to learn on or take out camping so as to not ruin your higher quality instruments, this is the one to go for."
4,awesome guitar but you can not play it right away.,"I bought this guitar last april. It was 80 bucks back then. After doing a lot of research, this is my best choice. It is well made and simple. It does't look cheap. But the strings are rusted when I opened the box. But who uses the stock strings anyway. SO be sure buy new strings for it, and a pick. THen you are ready for a painful journey of learning guitar. :)"
3,Not Fully satisfied,I got this product delivered yesterday. I am not fully satisfied with this Guitar..The negative side of this guitar:1) I don't think that the quality of the strings are good. May be after replacing the strings and playing it for a couple of months it will sound better ...Positive side:1) Price - I bought it in 78$.. So it is an affordable guitarI valued the affordability of this guitar to weigh more..So 3 stars!!
3,hope it get's better,"Bought this as a gift for my adult daughter, she broke a string right away and since restringing it won't stay in tune."
4,Sounds pretty good for a $75 guitar,"Decided to pick up the guitar again after about 15 years of not playing. This guitar seems pretty nice out of the box. Sounds good, and the action is not as high as people have been saying. All told, I'd say it is a pretty good guitar for the price. I was about to downgrade it for not having two knobs for the guitar strap...then I remembered that acoustics only have the one knob at the bottom. If you are looking at a good beginner's guitar, this is the one."
1,Not much to say that is good.,"Hard to play, bad sound, neck was cracked and horrible customer service! (I have never given a one star rating this is my first...it is that bad)."
4,Easy to Play - Good Sound,"The guitar had a perfect setup right out of the box, making it very easy to play. My classical guitar-trained brother tried it out and was favorably impressed. The sound is decent and nice to listen to. This guitar is a real bargain at less than $100. One would have to spend more than $200 to get something better."
2,It plays ....,"When my beloved old guitar gave up the ghost (long story) I needed a guitar in a hurry, but had no money. This one had good reviews, so I gave it a try. I knew it wouldn't be anything amazing, but still expected, based on the reviews, something a bit better than I got.It's very light, with a flimsy feel to it, enhanced by the matte finish ... it really DOES look like a balsa-wood airplane. The high action hurt my fingers, so I immediately swapped the fairly heavy strings it came with for a lighter set of Martin steel strings, and noticed a further deterioration in the already only so-so tone. It stays in tune quite well, but no matter what I do it just sounds ... cheap.If you're an absolute beginner (or are buying for a child who will probably get bored with the guitar in a few months) and don't want to spend much, this may be an ok 'first guitar', but a more experienced player will want something better. Something that I am now saving my pennies to get."
5,Teenagers love it!,"Our teenage boys are extremely happy with their guitars. Nice look and good sound. So far the only thing they would have preferred different, is that it would have been an electric accoustic."
1,don't do it!,"I absolutely would NOT recommend this guitar, unless you just feel like wasting your money. First off, it comes with an awful, obnoxious sticker on the pickguard, which is nearly impossible to remove. Also, the action on it is low, which causes a really annoying buzz when you play the low E string and A string. The only thing this guitar could possibly be good for is firewood."
5,Best Sound at Price,"My sister got another entry level guitar (I think it was the Rogue RA 100D) at around the same time and the whole family agrees the Takamine Jasmine sounds better. As a complete musical novice I am not very discerning, but I would say it's not hard to hold the strings for notes (action is not too high). Strings came with a few spots of corrosion so I'm sure they ought to be replaced (not sure I would notice the difference, though). After months of owning I noticed the white bit up top by the tuners (the nut) is set deeper on one end than the other. So the quality is not perfect but for the price it is a superb way to start learning guitar."
4,Good for the online gamer,"This mic is good for the online gamer. I got it for christmas and use it all the time. It links up to the controler and does fine. When these things first game out they didnt work that well, but they're fine now. Great sound and range."
2,headset wireless,"excellent headset... but the battey die to early... and in six months its not working, not charging. try with the normal microsoft version."
1,Canon PSC-40 Leather Soft Case for A3000,"The camera fits well , but this is not a lether case at all. Not happy after all."
1,What Was I Thinking?,Made a mistake by buying this product. Didn't work as I thought it should. I returned it.
1,Mess up after mess up STAY AWAY,Ordered product with frames. They did not ship them with frames. Called them and they said it would be overnighted to me. They were not and a week later I still had no frames and they have no active method of tracking or understanding what is happening. Mistakes do happen but eventually a company cannot continue to make additional mistakes especially after they understood that they messed up to begin with. DO NOT RECCOMMEND.
3,Pedrini Wine cork puller,Used this a couple of times. Not quite as good as previous ones I've had like this. But still ok.
5,excellent teamwork,"I think, this is one of the best recordings of Brahms Piano Quintet. This work is one of the best and most famous chamber work of Brahms and it is a huge work like a symphony written for quintet. Even so, the work to be constitued in a typic symphony form-4 movements. And it's musical language typical Brahms; a Scandinavian atmosphere, somewhere heavy, stormy and cold, but somewhere lyric and warm... And it's performance is really good. It's one of Glenn Gould's first succesful recording (made n 1957 in a CBC broadcast) with his historic 1955 Goldberg Var.. And also, Montreal String Quartet is very good and they are fell and bringing the typic character of Brahms. Schumann's recording is very good,too but I think, the star of this CD is Brahms.Highly recommended for a really good chamber music recording."
1,not worth the money,"for the price i would expect this product to last at least a year. it lasted about 6 months, long enough to be out of the warranty period and of course now i can't return it. so, i would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,This is great tape,I do not recommend getting cheap electrical tape. This is worth every penny. It works very well and stays in place. I highly recommend this tape and from Amazon.
4,Great deal!,I really like this vacuum. It's easy to handle and cleans really well. The red/green light that informs you of the amount of dirt in the area is a bit interesting to get use to but helpful.
2,"I ORDERED 5 sprouters, and only got 3","I ordered 5 sprouters and 5 seed samplers, I got a large box with 3 sprouters and the 5 packages of seed samplers.How do I get my other two sprouters????Where are they???"
5,SO COOL!,"this makes sprout draining easy, without major disruption of the seeds. so glad i got it. : D"
3,It's ok,It worked ok but after only three days the sprouts had some sort of white fungus growing on them so had to toss them. I used the seeds that they sent. I don't know if it's the seeds or because of the way the sprouter is shaped. I had also bought one of those three tiered sprouters and even on day 5 the sprouts have no fungus.
5,Another Happy Customer,"After taking a class and reading a book on sprouting, I was sure I'd never be able to do it. The procedure seemed so complicated, and I had never previously succeeded in growing anything.Only because I'd invested time and money into learning about sprouting, did I decide to buy equipment. This was my first choice because of all the positive reviews.I'm glad I bought it. My husband and I have been regularly enjoying our home-grown alfalfa sprouts for several months. This product is appropriately named. I had no trouble understanding the directions, and I didn't watch a video. The routine from start to finish is easy and doesn't require a lot of time.Add me to the list of people who endorse this product."
4,Charming. How could it NOT be?,"Few heterosexual males are going to get bored reading about over-sexed schoolgirls, but this book is much more than a sexual travelogue.Warner gives a real feel for the situation that these girls are in -- poverty, class struggles, family problems, insane nuns, etc.His use of language and even punctuation are pretty innovative -- a little hard hard to plow through, sometimes, but adding to the reading experience rather than subtracting from it.I consider it pretty high praise to say that a book really took me to a place I have never been before, but THE SOPRANOS has done just that."
4,Irreverent Scottish Youth,"My first Warner novel, it's taken me quite a while to get through it. The book is written in dialect, which I usually hate, but it's done so well here that I can't imagine the story without the dialog/dialect interwoven through it. Having said that, I feel that b/c of the intensity of the dialect, I had some trouble adequately distinguishing the female characters from eachother. This is a novel by a young Scottish author, who is (I assume), writing outside mainstream UK establishmentarian literary circles. The author gives us some insight into Catholic high schools, and into Scottish societies in general."
2,"Book is great, binding is not","This book gives a great overview of the Eastern Sierra. Lots of pretty pictures, and both history, cultural and natural sites are covered. However, the binding for this book is terrible. Mine fell apart the day I bought it."
4,Adult. - Resuscitation,"There's some fine electro on RESUSCITATION, no doubt about it. But the vocals can get tiresome. Sure, on certain tracks (""Lost Love,"" ""Contagious""), they add an icy sheen, but on others, they're just plain annoying. Vocals are supposed to add texture, especially when you consider the incredibly textured music going on, but these vocals simply add the same texture all the time, and it can get dull. Instead, focus on the music itself, which takes the cake. ""Hand to Phone"" moves in so many directions that your attention is constantly redirected (the lyrics say, without irony, ""She talks to you in monotone...""). The toes get a-tappin' when they hear the instrumental ""Mouth to Mouth,"" and the fingers will be a-snappin' with the dark and dense ""Pressure Suit."" So while I won't dispute the musical pleasures of this album, don't get me started again on the lyrics."
1,Item not working with recommended card,"After repeatedly trying to print from a card recommended in the booklet and after requesting technical support, I am unsatisfied with product and vendor. I emailed support on April 8th and was promised an answer within 48 hours and 4 days later am still waiting."
2,Not for the Particular,"I was ""re-gifted"" this printer after dipping my toe into digital photography. I consider myself a 30 year amateur who still loves my SLR & negatives, but attracted to digital by the versatility & convenience. This is an ok printer for everyday use. The skin tones are too red, and resolution not great. Printing is very slow. I haven't used it enough to empty the 1st ink cartridge yet, so I can't comment on that aspect. If you're looking for something to just print those shots to hang on the fridge, it's ok. I'm now looking to purchase a better printer that will produce up to 5x7, at least, prints in the HP brand as I've had good experience with their brand, not so with Lexmark."
4,"It really is tape, just not very sticky","It is tacky tape, not super sticky but it holds to itself well enough. If you are looking for a tape that will endure stress that might cause it to unstick you should probably look afor another product."
2,False Advertising,"Ordered 2 rolls for use at work, neither roll was 3M brand. Used for about a month now and seems to be holding up ok, but I've seen the real 3M brand hold better. For the money spent, buy the real stuff from another store."
4,bittersweet,"The Emanuels have put together a stunningly beautiful book on how they mad the wedding dress of the century. I loved it and yet reading it is a bittersweet experience. Each little stitch, each little detail and addition of tulle and lace moved Diana further down a path to a fraudulent marriage to a man who didn't love her and never would. It's almost as if everyone around her knew what the real score was but no-one wanted to clue in the bride because it wouldn've spoiled the show. Reading A Dress for Diana reminded me that fairy tales can have tragic endings too."
5,Customers LOVE Seeing Their Design on Glass Eye 2000,"Glass Eye 2000 is an indispensable part of my business! As the owner of a studio that does only commissioned work, the ""see before you buy"" feature has enabled me to nearly double my annual sales. Also, time between initial customer consultation and a signed contract has been substantially reduced. With the use of my laptop and a digital projector, my customers and I can explore glass alternative selections almost instantly. Furthermore, the use of a projector enables the customer to see an accurate rendition of the final product in its intended location. This capability worked particularly well during the design stages of two church commissions currently in progress."
2,Discouraging,"My father fought from North Africa, Italy, Southern France, Austria and finally Germany. He was wounded 4 seperate times. Received Silver Star, Purple Heart and Bronze star. His 19 year old half brother was killed beside him. All that being said, he and his comrades that I interviwed almost never took these mindless Nazis prisoner. The stories that they personally experienced of their Nazi crimes were beyond human comphrension. I am disqusted that anyone would think of these creatures in any terms but the horrible instruments of a maligant society. I am upset when I read these glowing comments on this herrondeous organization. These same men in my fathers outfit had respect and soldier to soldier consideration for the regular German Verhmacht. This movie does little to show what they were really about, which is Death and destruction."
4,OK,"needs more history related to the waffen SS,its uniforms, personnelbut it gives you an idea. not bad for the price."
4,"Great infuser, feels sturdy, could be bigger though.","It works well. The two spoons are a tad small for my chrysanthemum. If you have really big tea leaves, get one of the round ball ones or bigger.The piece is very sturdy. Doesn't feel cheap.The spoon is a little misaligned on mine. But its easily fixed and they clamped shut."
5,"Finally Troy,Sandara,and Connie on DVD",I have been waiting for years for these movies to be issued on DVD. I saw them all first run and loved them. I only hope that unlike the Gidget collection that these will all be issued in in their original widescreen format.
5,Oldtime Movies,I enjoy watching old movies especially from the late 50's and early 60's. The price was great and the movies were fun to watch. These movies are proof you don't need to show explicit sex or bloody violence to get a point across. I hope to see more packages like this.
4,Troy Donahue,"Since I am a Troy Donahue fan, I enjoyed Parrish, Roman Adventure and Susan Slade very much. These films brought me back to the teen I was at the time and helped me to re-live some of the happiest and most romantic times of my life. I was overwhelmed with nostalgia. But...Palm Springs Weekend was a huge disappointment. It did not compare in any way to the other three films, no real story, just fluff and silliness. It was sad to see that Troy Donahue's career had deteriorated to the point of accepting such a script. Unfortunately, he was under-rated as an actor, with such potential given the proper vehicles. Also the packaging wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was reasonably priced."
4,Great read for flyers,"I am a member of Pastor Mark Scott's congregation and am happy to report he brings the same insight and humor to this collection of meditations which we enjoy every week. I very much enjoyed the comments and observations which Pastor Scott has put forth in his book, ""Flights of Faith"". This is an easy read in bite-size pieces that will be great for relaxing in the waiting area or on the plane with. I found myself nodding in agreement often because many of the situations and thoughts he verbalizes each of us have probably had. I appreciate the way Pastor Scott connects these everyday life things to our spiritual life. Yet, he does this in a way which does not attempt to hammer you over the head with religion. His meditations provide a new and positive take to the ordinary and sometimes dreary task of air travel. There are many interesting observations on the airport and airline travel life here. I know I'll not look at the complimentary soft drink and peanuts the same way again!"
1,The book never came,"I am sure that the book is great, but it simply never got here. I'm kind of not too happy"
4,Fun but lots of filler,"If you haven't read Across the Nightengale Floor much of Grass for His Pillow isn't going to make any sense. This book is clearly a bridge between the first and third books in the series so it suffers a bit as a result. Despite that, Hearn's fantastical version of feudal Japan remains mesmerizing. Chracters are fleshed out a little bit more and we learn that Takeo really does have a destiny to fulfill. Takeo and Kaede both have a chance to grow independent of each other and it is interesting to watch the way each must move within their ""families."" I can't wait to see how Hearn brings it all together in the finale."
4,Couldn't put the book down until I had finished it,"I enjoyed the book because it described and era and a culture that was formally unknown to me. The story is riveting, and I couldn't wait to purchase the last book in the trilogy so that I could follow the story to its conclusion."
5,Great Product,I have a live plant take that I never considered fertilizing until a had an outbreak of long hair algae. Doing some research pointed to an overdose of excel leading to the death of the long hair algae. I tried doing that for a few days and it worked. It also had the benefit of helping the plants look better. Will continue to use to help control algae and also improve plant health. would recommend.
4,Good Morning America,"Good track, with very good songs and interesing concept. But after the Barrio Chino tour in New York may 1999, and now few time before next Barrio Chino tour in America in Agust 2000, we hope to know the interest of american musical public for the gypsies's travels,Christians, musulmans and Jews, Mediterranean cultures stories and so are."
2,Save your money!,"I bought this book before going to Belize. Although it contains some beneficial information it seems very dated. What most disappointed me though, was the photos. They are poorly done and many of them have nothing to do with fishing. There are pictures of flowers, hummingbirds, statues, etc. I bought a fishing book, not a sightseeing, flora and fauna book."
1,Never imagined I wouldn't like a Bruford CD,"As a big fan of Bruford (Earthworks, Crimson, Yes, UK, Bruford) and Levin (Crimson, Gabriel, Lennon, Liquid Tension Experiment, Bozzio Levin Stevens) I figured that a live double disc with this awesome rhythm section would be stellar... how wrong I was. This music is nothing like the ensembles mentioned above; it is very weird avant-garde improvisational jazz. Not that there is anything wrong with that... if you like Mingus, Dolphy, and Coleman there may be quite a bit to enjoy, and maybe I just can't appreciate this style of music.I have listened to this at least twenty times; therefore, this is not my initial reaction to this disc... for me there is nothing enjoyable on this CD. I would recommend any of Bruford's work mentioned above, but pass on this unless you're a fan of this type of music."
3,"Not worth the money, very cheap","The beads are foam and my 3 year old was able to break them apart very easily.I would highly recommend the Melissa and Doug Beads, you will have hours more fun, and they are durable !"
1,Completely Useless,This product is worthless. It doesn't remove any of the hair; it just goes over it and creates an unsightly redness and painful irritation while leaving all hair in tact. Avoid like the plague.
2,Intensive records management,"Origianally, when new, this book is part of a package with CD and many other components. I did NOT expect (as the description noted)to receive a CD, however, I fully expected to see all the other components and they were not part of this package. If the components were not part of this sale, the description should have said."
2,Did Not Work,I felt this product did not do anything about the bugs. I was looking for something to stop the white powder I see on the roses and stop the little red bugs that are on them.This did not work for that.
1,Six culturally insignificant refs,You wd never guess that for all the documents dated 1599 there are just six culturally irrelevant documents reklating to William Shakespeare.For a fuller review see deveresociety.co.uk reviews
2,Stick to the History,The material on the life and times is interesting; but Shapiro's literary judgments and textual interpretations are so wrong-headed as to be obtuse.
4,Springsteen's Sister Slashes Up Some Fun as Angela Returns!,"While this film is not necessarily high quality viewing, it is thoroughly entertaining. It carries a perfect balance of horror violence and humor. And while the movie generally runs on a so-bad-its-good scale, Pamela Springsteen is not so bad herself in her undemanding role as the mysterious Angela."
3,Not half bad sequel,"The original Sleepaway Camp was an underrated slasher romp that had a great twist to it, and considering this was the 80's and slashers were everywhere, it was only natural that a sequel would be due. Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers finds demented Angela (Pamela ""sister of Bruce"" Springsteen) as a counselor at the re-opened camp, and wouldn't you know it, there's another batch of sexy, loose moraled teens that need to be dispatched. With much more blood and gore than in the original (and most of it is nicely done), wooden acting, mullets aplenty, and hilarious odes to superior slasher icons Freddy Kruger, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface; Sleepaway Camp 2 doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing, and makes it all the more enjoyable. There would be another sequel to boot, but it was hardly any fun."
3,this movie was cool / especially for those who love slasher,"this movie was alright, there were some original kills,sinning teens watch out for angela the angel of death."
1,GREAT NOVEL: AWFUL EDITION,"This is a terrific novel--an amazing analysis of the power of white supremacy and the possibility of democracy. Purchasers deserve to read it in a decent edition. This General Books edition is an UNCORRECTED SCAN, a process which produces ridiculous and nonsensical text, as for instance when ""The End"" scans (as it does here) as: B'tj. In many places you can guess what the correct word might be but in many places you'll find yourself going to the online edition to figure out what's going on. BIG WASTE OF MONEY--buy the Cornell edition even though it costs more."
3,Useful Item,"For the price, this route planning software is useful. The poi's are still reasonably up to date and the GPS works fine. Using the GPS function when traveling solo is down right dangerous. The new dash mounted GPS Navigation units just make a lot more sense. I hooked my Earthmate GPS to one of the new Netbooks with 6 hours of battery life. After a few trial runs I decided to keep the software for route planning and use a dash mounted touch screen unit to provide directions while traveling. If you want to keep a partner busy while traveling, the Earthmate LT-20 would do that.."
4,Amazon has its data wrong on this,"I have this product, and Amazon is wrong in its description.I have tried to contact Amazon but they will not listen.THIS product does NOT come with Street Atlas USA 2008 PLUS; it comes with Street Atlas 2008. The PLUS software has a database of 150 million phone listings (imagine drive through Bethesda MD and your realize you have lost your contacts and need an eye doctor. PLUS software will help you find one with a phone number.)The software that comes with this product does not have 150 million phone listings.The software that comes with the more expensive Earthmate GPS BT-20 2008 IS Street Atlas USA 2008 PLUS with the 150 million phone listings.(Isn't it sad we have to correct Amazon product desciptions by writing a review instead of by contacting someone by email?)"
2,"Sweet, but strong aftertaste","Stevia is sweet, I'll give it that, but it has a weird flavor beyond that. It's kind of sour or bitter. It's all natural, and I do think it has a better flavor than saccharine or Nutrisweet, but it's not pure sweet enough and the flavor is distracting."
1,not a good deal,"doesn't work at all.i don't know why perhaps because of postal problems, or what ever but really not usable at all."
5,Excellent quality and imaginative play,"I purchased this basket for my 4-year old. I am very pleased with the quality, look and feel of the items. My daughter loves to put the food into her pots and pans and ""cook"" me up soups and stews and whatever wonderful things she can imagine. I like the wood items so much better than the plastic food we have had in the past. Since the description does not state it, here are the contents:Chocolate bar (1), Loaf of bread (1), Roll (1), Lunch meat (2) There is one orange and one red - shaped like the haba salami. Bananas (2), Cheese slice (2), Egg (1), Cheese wedge (1), Pear (1), Carrot (1), Orange (1), Apple (1), Milk jug (1)As the description states, the item size averages around 1 - 2 inches long. I would assume that the contents of the basket are a consistant thing and not variable. I will be browsing for the other food items available and getting more to expand her set. I.e. strawberry, red pepper, radish bunch, grapes, etc."
4,The Best from Michael Bolton,"""Drift away"" is powerful in this new rendition. It's hard to get a voice Like Michael... Just for this song alone, I will buy this album... I am actually re-buying this album since I can't find my old one... and I will never ever find other performances that can top 'Hold On, I'm Coming"" and ""Konck On Wood."" Pop songs don't get better than this.... guilty pleasures indeed!!! The best album from Michael Bolton...."
1,"This price, both used and new, is absurd.","This two disc compilation is beautiful and moving just like the art of capoeira. I would certainly purchase this, but not at the expense of reason. It is a shame that price mongers take advantage of enthusiasts, who wish nothing more than to partake in the cultural experiences of Brazil from the convenience of their homes. Often, people who can't afford to make the trip personally or have local access to music or artifacts within a reasonable distance go through platforms like Amazon to buy things at ""fair"" market prices advertised through the net and television. Do not be a victim of the hype because there are other vendors out there who will not price gauge!Go to capoeiraarts page and search this same artist to receive this same cd, brand new for a fraction of the price.I'm not bitter, I'm disgusted."
5,Kids Answers,"Ken Ham has his series answers and this is for kids, very intuitive and my son understands, at least to a small comprehension level of what the Bible is about. But again that take active instruction from the parents as well."
2,May be too old,"Most of the pens in this box of 12 ink-flow intermittently.I previously bought them in an office-supply store but can't find them this past year or so, but I found them here.I suspect Papermate stopped producing them and the ones still available are too old."
5,lost and found,"I recently found this album while rummaging through the hidden pocket of an old bag. I knew it was missing, I just couldn't place it. It actually bothered me at times. Let's just put it this way....I am very pleased that I've recovered it. Such a good album. Upbeat, light and airy. Easy listening with a Ben Folds-esque vibe. Love it."
3,"Nice, but...","The tools are ok, and work as advertised, but you can do the same work with standard woodturning tools, i.e. these don't really bring anything new to the table."
4,"Love it, but...","I really like this workout ,however if you fast forward or pause and try to hit the play button the dvd starts all over again (very irritating). Other than that, very easy to follow and I sure was sore the next day."
4,Good Workout DVD!,"This workout was well done. It is broken down into 4 segments. Each segment flows together nicely. It's challenging without being complicated. I love the background and music. The instructor has a nice modulating voice, not too preppy or annoying. I recommend this workout!"
3,My least favorite Fishbone album,"Pretty mediocre; I bought this when it came out and only listened too it a few times. I can't really put my finger on it, but it didn't grab my attention. ""Reality of my surroundings"" is better, ""In your face"" is much better. But if you want to check out Fishbone, ""Fishbone"" and ""Truth and Soul"" are the best by far."
2,nothing new,Much of the same accounts that are told over and over again. I was expecting more on today's accomplished Italian-Americans but it ended circa LaGuardia.
4,Polish Golabki,"Great for a lot of Polish cooking - especially stuffed cabbage. Product came very quickley. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the shipping price. (a little rediculous) If you live in the states, I would check your local foreign foods store before you dive into this."
5,One of the best albums I've heard so far this year!!!,This album was introduced to me while on an airline on a business trip and I loved the song so much I just had to have the album and now that I have been listening to it for a while it's truly a remarkable work of art!
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM...,"LISTENED TO SAMPLES AT SOOTHINGMUSIC.COM AND ALL I CAN SAY IS, 5 STARS ALL THE WAY...I LOVE THIS ALBUM."
1,A piece of junk.,"I wish I could have given negative grade for this product and Philips customer support.I received the device 10 days ago, and that is how long I've gone through pain dealing with it.The VHS part. I played a perfectly good VHS on this device, and after it ran, displayed picture on the TV for 10 minutes, the picture froze and stayed still forever. Forwarding it did not help. I still could hear the audio, but the video is a still screen. I tried with different tapes, to no avail.The DVD player is a lemon, too. I played a good DVD disc, which I verified with a SONY player, and it stopped working every 10 minutes and automatically shut down.I contacted Philips customer care, and got treated like an idiot. They want me to pay for shipping to a repair center for the brand new device that does not work right in the first place.So go with any other brands, but not Philips for this type of product."
1,Rubbish,"My wife is a big Miss Marple fan so we were quite keen to spend a nice evening with this viewing. Alas, where to begin? The plot was sophomoric at best. There was a great deal of time spent on characters who simply had no connection to the story and who obviously only served as red herrings. The murderer was fairly apparent half way through, but not because of any clever clues. Once the murderer was revealed to the dunder heads in the script the logical working out of clues was non existent.At one point the inspector went down into the cellar with a suspect to view the electrical fuses. While there he points out that the suspect was very near the place of the murder. Of course the murder took place upstairs on the second floor. (The first floor to Brits.) Unfortunately this was a prime example of the intellectual level of the entire script.The costumes were nice and there was a beautiful car in the movie. There were also a few laughs, but unfortunately there were directed at the hokey music."
5,good place,I bought a lighter did not work so i got mad and tossed it. And this place still gave me a refund i will definly buy from here again.
2,Very disappointing release.,"This cd is very disappointing. Matthew Herbert has been on the cutting edge of minimal techno, but in this work he slides over into lounge territory. None of the tracks are particularly bad: the problem is, they barely exist. They're pleasant and won't wake the baby. Think Kruder and Dorfmeister lite and you've got it."
4,"good told story in the savannah, but some parts were off.",A STORY WITH GOOD DETAIL ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE CHARACTERS AND THE SETTING. NICE STORY TO READ WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO.
4,"Clear, crisp communication",A great phone. Does not fade with minimal static moving from room to room. This is the second Panasonic phone that we will own. The phone brand has been virtually trouble free over the years for us.
5,great breast binder,really liked this binder. fits good and is exactly what i need to help keep the girls firm! i am very happy with the product!
1,BOOO,This is huge and if it worked it would be awesome.. do not know if it is a fluke or what but I will never know.
2,CENSORED!!!,"While the originals would have earned 5 star reviews, this version which contains versions that have been edited (and have huge black CENSORED bars over parts of the film that are not included in the originals) are not worth your time, unless of course you would be offended by sex, but then why would you be purchasing these in the first place if that were the case?!?!?"
2,The Sick and Twisted Horror of Joanna Angel,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. It was too short and the first 'short film' The Xxxorcist was censored! If I had known this I would not have purchased. I was expecting two longer films, similar to Joanna's regular work, with more shown! A lot 'longer' and more 'hard' core."
5,Best corkscrew I've seen in 16 years in the biz,"I've been given countless corkscrews by sales reps over the years and this is by far the best. As others have noted, the rubber grip is great both for its nonslip properties as well as its substantial size. Even with my very small hands I have found this extremely helpful when opening wines at table. Also, the blade is serrated and again, of a sufficiently substantial size, making it great for cutting through some rather thick foils. I've never had one of these fail or rust after years of heavy use (they do, however, disappear)."
1,Rust Rust Rust,"Don't get this thing close to a wet surface unless you want the small bolt to start rusting. The rest of the ""stainless steel"" started rusting also.It looked terrible, I threw it away."
3,Great dvd,A great sampling of matches from Daniel Bryan for a price everyone can afford. A great addition to my collection.
3,Not a good choice for the beginner or returning programmer.,"I decide to return to programming after a long absence. I think I made a really poor choice in this book. For me, it just didn't do the job. I had to get another book on C# to fully understand what was being said in this book. I really wish I would have just bought the other one in the first place. Some of the exercises ask you to do things that are never fully explained in the book. In addition, it only gives a brief explanation of classes, and that is the one thing I needed the most information on. All in all, not a great book for someone who has never programmed in an object oriented language. I guess if you have intermediate programming skills, you may be able to finish this book in 21 days, but it's simply not a good choice for those who are returning to programming after a long absence or for those who are a beginner."
2,Poor book for current programmers looking to move to C#,"The book is very barebones and basic. It does not cover anything in depth and you will find that you will need another book to help you with your project if you are counting on this one to do so. I find the topics discussed to be poorly documented and for a senior level developer moving to C# this book is not for you. Try APress's ""C# and the .net platform"" by Andrew Troelson (EXCELLENT BOOK..that has everything you will need to know about .net covered in depth!)"
3,The Man Who Always Peaked Too Soon,"Before The Right Stuff, Wolfe published this collection of his unique essays, enhanced with his biting illustrations. Whether word or line, his pen is wickedly clever and embarrassingly insightful. His piece in this collection on aircraft carrier pilots, ""The Truest Sport: Jousting with Sam and Charlie,"" is clearly the precursor to his block-buster account of the Apollo astronauts. Wolfe has always had the perfect eye for the right stuff, and has been decades ahead of his times, as he is obviously and ironically well-aware, judging from his illustrated essay ""The Man Who Always Peaked Too Soon."" From Bauhaus to candy-colored tangerine-flake hand-crafted hot-rods, to hippy glitterati on the Magic Bus, to hot-shot pilots, Wolfe's word-pictures are always perfectly ahead of his and our times."
1,Mariah Carey Is Terrible!!!!,"People, stop with this Mariah Carey is the best singer to grace the earth malarki! When she sings, it is not pleasant to me. For each his own I guess, but when you have artists like Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, and Martina McBride out there, what possesses you to get all excited about Mariah and say she's the best singer in the world? I mean, Christina Aguilera can sing Mariah Carey under the table any day of the week. Could she not? Mariah's studio music is bad... and her live ""unplugged"" bunk is too. A friend of mind gave me this CD so I didn't waste any money on it. And it's not a music CD anymore, it's a nice coaster on which I sit my Celine Dion coffee mug. The fact of the matter is that Celine undoubtedly is the best vocalist out there, and to even mention Mariah Carey in the same manner is just ridiculous. If you want a live CD that won't make you bleed at the ears, I suggest any of Celine Dion's three live CDs. Get real, people."
4,Early Mariah,"This is Mariah back in 1992, at the early stage of her career. Unfortunately there are only 7 songs on here totalling approximately 30 minutes, but then again this is an EP! Personally, I prefer her in an acoustic setting such as this, a lot better than with all the synths. Also of note on this album, is a cool cover of The Jackson Five's ""I'll be There."" No Mariah Carey collection is complete without this album...don't be put off by the low number of songs."
5,She finally proved herself!,This album is of course Mariah letting the world know her voice was not manufactured and that it was really her voice. While I do think it is a tiny bit overrated it is still essential for any Mariah fan. Her voclas were especially amazing on I'LL BE THERE. VISION OF LOVE and CANT LET GO are others she sang extremely well. Highly recommended!
3,Coming-Of-Age,"For viewers looking to indirectly relive their puberty, Julia is the absolute master. She is a Sexy bombshell on a train and he's the young gun wishing to lose his virginity. Julia rests as a glorious model of the exciting use of anything is possible. Coming-of-age films are precious because they give us the adventures of growing up all over again."
1,Mehdi Meanderings,"I can't believe the amount of praise for these recordings...I am unable to hear what others claim to find in this music. Some have compared him to Yanni. While I find Yanni to be a musical genius, Mehdi's works seem disoriented and rambling. I find no inspiration in his melodies, and his intrumentation is unimaginative. His percussive accompaniment sounds like...keyboard loops. I had great expectations when I first listened to Mehdi's music, so I'm greatly disappointed."
3,"NOT BAD, NOT GREAT","Yes, soothing, pleasant listening when driving or having friends around, but not really fantastic sounds to get really excited about. A notch below the likes of Ronnie Aldrich with his twin pianos or the many classic Ray Conniff instrumentals."
4,Retractable Ballpoint Pens,Have used these pens for a long time. They have no cap to lose and are comfortable to hold. The medium point is a tad smaller in diameter than the last ones I bought from a local retailer but that shouldn't be a problem. I always look to Paper Mate for a quality pen.
4,For birders and bird lovers,"For birders and bird lovers, this book takes you into your own backyard and then to far away places as you travel with birds and researchers alike along the path of migration and the lives of songbirds written out in four seasons. The book also provides a wealth of resources for birders and bird enthusiasts of locations to see what where and when, and then the book goes on to say a little about why. There are resources too for getting involved and learning more. Whether reading this book for fun, following the stories of the birds, learning about the latest research in the world of songbird migration, or using it as a gateway to a world of birding adventures and fun, I highly recommend it."
4,Great watch for the price,"I was going to buy an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra watch with the blue dial, but then lost a few bucks in the stock market. The Bulova 96C23 (wish they'd names their watches) is a knock-off of that Aqua Terra watch, for a lot less $$$. It looks great, is easy to read, and I highly recommend the watch. The only thing negative I'd say is that the color of the dial is darker than the pictures on the internet. It is not a medium shade 'aqua' blue, but dark navy blue in person. The marketing people have gone too far when lightening the blue color for marketing purposes."
2,Starts promisingly but ends with a thud.,"In ""Bad Chemistry,"" Kate Baker is a former cop, now turned social worker, who has married Joel Baker and moved toWashington, D. C. Kate's husband suddenly disappears under mysterious circumstances. The book starts out well. Kate is a sympathetic and smart character and we root for her to get to the bottom of Joel's disappearance without coming to any harm herself. Unfortunately, the books goes badly off track at the halfway point. Kate becomes Nancy Drew as she runs around interrogating anyone who might shed light on what her husband has been up to. The ending of the book is not believable and the conclusion is unsatisfying and pointless. This is too bad, since the book had promise that was ultimately unfulfilled."
3,A puzzling conundrum,"If you like the books of Peter Abrahams, you'll like this one, though not as much. It's not as scary or suspenseful, but has a similarly driven and sympathetic heroine. The ""smart drugs"" back story was a bit too technical for me, and the boy who helps Kate solves the crimes is creepy, like Seth Green in ""Radio Days."" But it keeps you reading all the way to the last page, and it sure has a lot to say about marriage!"
5,Eye for great music,"Eagle Eye Cherry has once again produced another great album. His debut album was excellent from start to finish and so is this one. The whole family will like his music as there is such a huge contrast on the album. Featuring tracks like Are You Still Having Fun, Long Way Around, Burning Up and shades of grey it proves that Eagle Eye Cherry is going to be someone to look out for in the future. (look out for a guest apperance by Neneh)"
4,Refills,"These refills work great, I would expect them too, the pens are great too, wouldn't use any other kind. Might be a little on the pricey side, but well worth it."
5,Good alternative to buying new pens,"I love this brand of pens, and can't always find them in the store. This was a great way to save a little money as long as you don't lose the shell of the original pen."
3,not what I expected,These noodles are the kind served cold with ground pork in Vietnamese restaurants. I was expecting a softer Chinese noodle. These taste very low fat and make for a light meal in hot weather.
4,Enjoying my new digital photo frame,Not a problem - found it easy to use. I bought it for a family member and I believe she will be able to change out memory cards fairly easy as we update her with new pictures.Great way for older family member to stay in touch with family outings!!!!!
2,Dissapointed,"I was looking for an inexpensive sled and thought this would do the job. It does not. It is too high for scoped rifles. I cannot remain seated on the shooting benches I have used it on. I need to stand and lean over the rifle in order to aim it. And the rear rest/channel is too tight for some of my milsurp stocks to fit into. So I not only have a problem with my scoped sporters, I have a problem with some of my military firearms. On the plus side, I love the elevation and the side to side adjustment.I have since ordered a good front and rear rest system."
3,ESL Beginner,"ESL Beginner is a good book, however, beginner is misleading. Students would need to be at least at an intermediate level to use the book. For example, the first chapter discusses different types of nouns, such as count, noncount, proper, and common. Good activities, helpful pictures."
3,Kept expectation low,"I wasn't expecting much since I've read the reviews before purchasing that said the papers were thin. For my 5 year old just learning to write, it's good enough. However, for any other uses, I won't recommend."
1,I feel ripped off.,I bought this and when it came in the plastic cover was open from the bottom. It seems like they just repackaged non-branded line paper and put it into a plastic bag with a Mead title cover. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
2,Chinese Dragon Temporary Tatto 1.5x2,"I love the design of temporary tattoo. However,I've found out there's chemical that isn't goodfor health on a skin. I couldn't risk that factor.So, I'd retraced and colored with marker exactlyof the design on paper. I put glue stick and stickedit on my bicep arm for my halloween costume.Also, I wish chinese dragon temporary tattoo wasbigger and safer.T. M."
2,my review,"I have previously enjoyed books by this author, but I was not prepared to read a story about England in the mid 1500's combined with demons and angels. In my opinion the story would have been much more interesting and real without these ""add-ons"". It diminishes the historical interest of the book and only makes it a ""fantasy"" novel."
4,Nice story and illustration,"My 10 months daughter love this book. She's very excited every time I show her every page of this book. When i do the same thing with poppy, pretending to be a giraffe, penguin ...she can't stop laughing.The illustrations is so stunning. Very nice book for children."
4,3 to 5 and still alive!,"I've been in and out of prison most of my life and I specialize the in fine art of prison tattooing. Now, I've tried many types of pens, Pilots, Sanfords, Paper Mates, and others. But for the sheer consistency of color, permeability, and aesthetic character, I use only BIC(R) Cristal(R) Ballpoint Pens.When you try to get the ink to adhere to a sharpened paper clip, you instantly can tell the difference in workability with a Bic. The fine line work reqired in realistically rendering a flaming serpent wrapping the bare breasts of a nymph straddling a crucifix would be nearly impossible with any other pen.Clients can be picky. So when I aim to please I trust on BIC(R) Cristal(R) Ballpoint Pens."
3,Zoom G2 Effects,"The Zoom G2 is an inexpensive effects box that performs as advertised. However, if I were doing it over I probably would not purchase the unit. I later bought a small format mixer, a XENYX 1202FYX, for small venue gigs and found it had most of the effects the Zoom has and all that I need. The Zoom's tuner works fine, but so does the one built into my Tak. The rhythm feature is OK but not exceptional. The XENYX gives me good and easier control over the effects that I actually use. So, the Zoom G2 is fine if that's all you want or need."
2,Not what I expected based on other reviews,"This book was not what I expected at all. It's hard to describe the short comings of this book. The book is neither very technical, nor does it provide enough interesting information to laymen. With a background in science, I was expecting a more technical treatment of Statistics and its history. However, I do have to give the author credit for making his intentions clear in his preface. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the statistical topics are covered so superficially as to make them meaningless to the layman. In the end, the book ends up being a series of biographical vignettes about the figures that had a hand in the development of Statistics and its role in Science."
1,Truly Tasteless Jokes,At best I can only say most jokes were stale. I take take that back. I can also say this would be the perfect gag gift and I stress the word gag.
5,Fabulous!!!!!!,"First of all how can anyone get mad that a book titled ""truly tasteless jokes"" has just that; ""tasteless jokes"". that's like getting mad at a cookbook that has recipe's. Some of you people can suck the humor out of life just by breathing. I truly love the 5th amendmant it let's this book get printed and buzz kills like you speak there peace. It's a damn joke book, get Tolstoy if you want something serous to read; this isn't it. This is foul humor at it's best, very best. It will take your mind off the serious things in life like my breast cancer. Sometime's you just need to laugh your ass/balls off. Buy it if thats what your goal is. But don't take it around any buzz kills they may just kill you."
3,Jokes in the realm of career killers,"These jokes are so much in the realm of ethnic fighting words and base crudity that I reached the conclusion that the author had to be a pun rather than a real person. There are slurs against blacks, Poles, Irish, Jews, WASPs and others and they bite hard. It would be a brave person that would tell any of them except within the company of very close associates whose opinions are well known. There are many professions where the telling of one of these jokes would severely damage or kill your career.If you are a fan of extremely crude jokes, then you will find this collection hilarious, otherwise you will be blanching at the crudeness."
5,Worth every penny,"After conducting a lot of research and purchasing the top of the line Philips player (the hard to find 865)and having nothing but problems- despite calls to Philips, etc.- I sent it back for the Pioneer 626. This is just an outstanding player and absolutely loaded with features (having capabilities most probably won't take full avantage of, but it's nice to know your player can handle your setup as it grows and improves). Extraordinarily crisp picture, crystal clear sound, built in Dolby Digital AND DTS ( a rarity), easy to set up and use- and virtually every feature can be handled by the joystick remote. Yes you can buy a cheaper, functional player, but especially considering how much this has come down from its original spendy list price (checking around online retailers pays off), why? A serious machine that'll satisfy the most demanding cinemaphiles. You get what you pay for- do right by yourself and spring for the 626."
5,The best,This is my first dvd player. I intended to buy a Toshiba brand but I instead I did some quick research in a mag and in my pockets and I found that this was the best choice for me. If you loves films and are critical about how things look and sound this is the unit for you.
3,broken in 14 months,This is a fine player--when it played. Unfortunately it began skipping after 14 months...not what we expect in an item allegedly near the top of Pioneer's consumer product line. My entire system is pioner from the Elite projection T.V. to the surround receiver. Everything else has been fine.
1,"Just like everyone else said, it doesn't work","I should have listened to the other reviews. This adapter does nothing. Do not waste your money and buy this, really."
3,"A ""Must Read"" for Native American history buffs","As an author myself, I appreciate what author David E. Jones did--keep a memory alive of a ""medicine woman"" he had come to know. I found it helpful in my writing my Native American history book THE COMANCHE (Chelsea House, due out 2010).Some passages are unclear and a little choppy, though, which is why I gave it three stars.I would have liked it to be longer, and more like a story--a complete biography.David, I'd like to see this more fleshed out, somewhat more refined, and longer. Rework it and get it republished! In the meantime, though, all people who consider themselves well versed in Native American history should read this.[...]"
3,Does what it says but.....,"i have to say that this product came with a lot of recommendations and a lot of parts with a lot of instructions!! i was thinking wow it has to be the real deal!! but when i finally put it all together it does boost my cellphone signal up, but i started to notice that it was only on certain types of cellphones, for example i have a blackberry 9780 bold and it seems to work fine, but my other fellow workers that have regular fleet phones like the motorola wx292 the signal does not increase or improves, im still trying to determine if it was a great buy or just a simple buy!!"
1,One of the worst Korean movies ever,"Not sure if it's a bad English dub or not (I've noticed that Korean movies are better with subtitles only), but this movie was awful. Most of the characters are unlikable. I mean, the main guy kicked his dog, for goodness sakes.The movie jumps from comedy to drama and back too much.I think the creators wanted to show that life doesn't make sense, so some unsavory characters survived the tsunami while honorable characters died. But that stuff makes a bad movie since the characters were so weird and crazy.The CGI is good. Stick to watching the trailer.Only watch this if you have Amazon Prime for free viewing.Horrible movie, with only a few redeeming scenes.Look elsewhere for good Korean movies.Fans of disaster flicks such as 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow will be disappointed: the bulk of the movie focuses on a bunch of characters, before the disaster hits at the end- almost like a bad Godzilla movie.I'm sorry."
3,KOREAN KORN,"Unlike my other respected reviewers, I found this movie filled with all the cliches of standard disaster films--they just spend more time focusing on them. I found all the exposition trite and predictable. The movie's strengths are its frequent humor and respectable effects. It's two hours length is about 30 minutes too long. If you like background stories, you'll probably enjoy this more than I did."
3,Not what you would expect.,This movie is called Haeundae in South Korea. I have watched and own the Korean blu-ray of the film and just want to warn you that that this is not a movie that matches the cover at all. In fact for the most part it is a film about the lives and loves of a bunch of people and has almost nothing to do with a Tsunami at all. It is interesting enough if you are familiar with South Korea and the Haeundae area of Busan but if you have no idea about anything I just wrote you may want to skip this one or wait until it is on a big discount.
3,I guess you have to be Korean to understand the humor?,"No... then again I can picture my Korean twin somewhere watching this movie with the same expression on his face as I had. Wondering why the disaster movie he picked up is actually a comedy. ""The Host"" was good because its blend of comedy worked. ""Tidal Wave"" is annoying because it's comedy moments just randomly pop up and it never stops. Not to mention every single person in this film acts like they are drunk. I was expecting a serious survival movie! and I want a serious survival movie! I'm quite sure my Korean twin is typing the same thing on the Korean equivalent to Amazon. He's shaking his fist in disgust and asking himself why can't every movie I pick up be as good as Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance Why!!!!!!"
2,Tidal wave,The movie isnt what I expected. I was very disappointed. You can tell the voices were dubbed for language purposes.But could have at least used voices that would have been more realistic to the characters.
4,The Best Campus Novel,"The campus novel, written both by British and American writers, became a recognized subgenre in the last 50 years. Most of these books, produced by writers with academic appointments, are not very interesting. This book, however, is a real exception. This is simply the best campus novel and a devastating sendup of academic pretense and radical chic. In many ways, this book is also the best novel of the 60s as well. A key feature of this book is that Bradbury's characters are not caricatures; he is very careful to mix real elements of sympathy with his satire."
2,Unnecessary except for collectors.,"The amazon.com description of this is incorrect (it describes the 7"" vinyl release). Below is a correct description:Track Listing:1. Good Vibrations 4:452. In Blue Hawaii (instrumental) 2:43""Good Vibrations"" is a slightly different edit taken from the album to include the ""Our Prayer"" reprise that is part of the track before it. ""In Blue Hawaii"" is a full instrumental edit-- I had been hoping we'd get the ""I Love to Say Da-Da"" backing vocal isolated (""wah wah ho wah""). Nonetheless, its an interesting piece, there's actually string parts buried below the ""water"" chant section I'd never noticed, and it is quite interesting to hear the piece without the music.However, while I liked this a bit, I can't imagine anyone who isn't seriously into Brian Wilson/The Beach Boys would care, or deem this worth the price for a two and a half minute instrumental edit, and if you're a serious collector, you probably already own it."
3,sound is muddy,"I'm no sound expert, but the sound quality on this CD is quite lacking in clarity, which is kind of sad considering that is exactly what Barbra is known for."
2,"1000 ""conservative"" sweaters","Unless you are a very conservative petite woman who likes to work in mainly the finer gauges of yarn and wants a sweater that looks like you bought it at TJ MAXX you will be disappointed in this book. They should have titled this book ""100 Sweaters for the Republican Woman with a lot of time on her hands"""
3,"cheap and dull, exactly what i need","hey,im reviewing these pens.i teach a detention class where the students have to write, and i use these as standard pens, they write well, and not stolen cause of low value. personally i use the bic cristal for reliablility"
5,Great product to get you over $25,"Other people have written reviews on this item about the great price for these pens. I agree. So instead, I will write about another use for this product in case someone is searching for a way to break the super saver shipping $25 mark. This is perfect for that. Who can't use a bunch of Bic pens? Instead of wasting the $1 on something you will just throw away, get this."
4,Great Value,"I really like these pens. I am a waitress so I am always looking for new pens that I can use to write orders. I chose the blue pens and they are really nice. I love how cheap they are, but the quality is really nice. The pens write really smoothly."
3,THREE STARS FOR THREE SMOKIN'-HOT TUNES...,"... notably, 1) Billy Joel's ""All Shook Up""; 2) Travis Tritt's ""Burning Love""; 3) Dwight Yoakam's ""Suspicious Minds"". An honorable mention goes to Ricky Van Shelton's ""Wear My Ring Around Your Neck""... most disappointing cover was John Mellencamp's ""Jailhouse Rock"" - he's got what it takes to rock it, but he totally wimped out (oh, the shame!). And as for Bryan Ferry... what's that artsy-fartsy fruitcake doing on this soundtrack??? And Amy Grant? Puh-leaze. She's the musical poster girl for the Reader's Digest crowd. The travelling salvation show went that-a-way, Amy!"
3,cmcc*yoda,The yoda costume had been made with quality warm fabric. Nice over all appearance. But the ears on the head piece were not as showed on the picture. They look more like shreak ears..kids kept asking if my son was shreak. It was a little disappointing.
3,Small head-piece,"I bought this Yoda costume for my 2 year old. The robe fits him perfectly, but the head-piece is ridiculously tight. I'm pretty sure my kid doesn't have an abnormally large head. The velcro tab under the chin is a way too snug, so I'm going to have to extend it somehow. Other than that, the costume is great."
3,Cute but...,I bought this for my 1 1/2 yr old son. The robe seems to fit him just fine and will keep him worm during the cold Halloween night when we are out but the head piece as others mentioned is way to small and will have to adjust by adding a piece or something else.
4,Cute,"This was a really cute costume for our toddler this Halloween. We were all Star Wars characters, but he was by far the cutest. I had to adjust the length of the sleeves and robe to fit my son (who was wearing 18-24 months in most clothes at the time) but its was easy to do. My only complaint is that the ears on the costume flop down and look a little more like Shreck than Yoda. Still, it was really cute and a good price point."
4,head a little small,"The body part was almost too long for my 1 year old, but the head piece barely fit. That being said, it was a great costume, and we got some really cute pictures!"
3,"An ""OK"" book.","I found this book to be only an ""OK"" book. I found myself skipping over a lot of it... never a good sign. There was not enough sexual tension between the two and the plot regarding the treason was never really very interesting to me. The hero, Revan, did not make me ""sigh"" like a good romantic hero should. I like a good story full of romance and adventure, but this one seemed to drag along a little too much for my taste."
1,Cat loved it - but it is a piece of junk,Purchased this product. Was happy with it for a couple of weeks. Cat liked it a lot. Started having problems with fish spouting the correct amount of water. Requested a replacement. Replacement arrived sent back defective one. New one has worked for about a week but now have the same problem with the replacement. Same problem with spouting water from fish mouth. Good concept but needs work. Wish I could find something similar to a tap being on over sink like this one. Wrote to Cats Rule about it but never received a reply. Guess they don't care. It's a piece of junk. Don't waste your money or time.
2,He's Losing It!,"This the is third book in a row that shows this series' decline. The far-fetched plot is based on two stolen carved African eagles, and Zee makes goo-goo eyes at a studly African from the moment she meets him. The reason, we find out at the end, is that she needed at that moment to love someone other than her husband...and he's cool with that. Puleeeeeeze! Mr. Craig needs to start writing for the reader again, and not for the bank...and we'll all be a lot happier!"
2,Pretty not practical,"This cookware is gorgeous looking, but it is not designed for the serious cook. With heavy usage, the outside enamal portion is permanently stained, and the heat transfer performance is not up to par with Calphalon or All-Clad. For boiling and sauces, this cookware would be fine, but not for frying, braising, or other heavy duty use.If you are considering this cookware for the looks, I would highly recommend adding pieces of All Clad or Calpholon for heavy duty use, since those will perform and still look good, and save the Chantal for presentation purposes."
5,Must have,"I love this book. The first day I got it, I couldn't put it down. It is very light reading, and is a great book to read. The art work is beautifully done, making it looks like they were actually squished. It also is great how you can see the main character kind of 'grow up'. This book is not for children in anyway, however, but it is a great gift for someone who has a sense of humor and loves fairys (ect)."
5,Great Gift Idea for the Fairy Collector,I purchased this book for my cousin who collects faires. She was delighted. Loved it! The drawings are beautiful and the content humorous. She actually uses it as a journal for herself. Great gift!
5,'Gertrude' Ma Rainey is the MOTHER of the blues allright!!!,"She could eat Bessie Smith for breakfast, Clara Smith for lunch, Eva Taylor for dinner and Mamie Smith for a midnight snack(only Alberta Hunter and Sippie Wallace were in her class). Rainey really belts the blues with a guttsy earthy tone, that even todays wildest rocker can't repeat. Rainey has a don't give a darn attitude in her voice and a loud authoritive sound, and her diction is completely understandable(unlike Ida Cox, as good as she was).Rainey also had some great ""dixieland"" or ""ragtime"" style jazz players backing her up. This cd is even better then the great Yazoo compilation, featuring superior sound quality, and most of the same songs, but has two more songs(18 vs. 16 on the Yazoo set). I picked this cd up for under 7 bucks!!! A great introduction to this rough and rowdy Mother of the Blues!"
4,A great book by an honest artist,"I came to Yoshi Oida's AN ACTOR ADRIFT through an interest in Peter Brook. The small book really overwhelmed me with Yoshi's straight-forward insights into the nature of performance, acting techniques (he's big into integrating Eastern and Western methods), his Japanese cultural roots, and the noble strive of an honest, questioning theatre artist in contemporary society. The book picks up with his introduction to Brook in the late 1960s and his departure from Japan, and roughly follows Oida's adventures and explorations over the next fifteen or twenty years. There is little information about his work after around 1990. I highly recommend it if you have a genuine interest in performance."
3,Movie for my daughter,This movie was for my little girl and she enjoyed it very much. we bought both the first one and second for an incredible price and am very satisfied. two thumbs up on the price and delivery.
5,ALVIN MOVIE,I RECEIVED THE MOVIE- ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS:THE SQUEAKQUEL AND HAVE SINCE SENT IT TO MY GARNDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT! IT WAS DELIVERED IT A TIMELY MANNER AND THE PACKAGING WAS GREAT!THANK YOU.
4,good fun movie,my kid (11 yo boy) BEGGED for this movie --I myself was dreading it--SUPRISE it was a fun silly movie --enjoy it
4,Adorable,"The chipmunks, original boys, and now the girls are all just as darling as the first movie. I did think, however; that the first movie had just a little better story, which is usually the case with a sequel. But all it all it was a charming movie and a nice experience watching it...and I will watch it again soon."
5,Great!,The DVD works perfect- my son loves it. The movie came in a timely manner- and I know scene for scene what is happening next.
3,DVD has Disc ERRORS,"As stated by another reviewer, right out of the package, our DVD also did not play properly. At first it displayed partial black screens, then it froze/paused constantly. A few minutes later,it caused our Sony DVD player to make a huge loud and continuous vibrating noise. I tried ejecting, powering off/on, tried to play it 6 or 7 more times, but got the same loud noise. I put in a different DVD and it played fine so I knew it was the Disc. At some point, I think my tv screen displayed a ""Disc Error"" message. I promptly returned the item today and repurchased another. The other reviewer said their DVD was warped. I didn't notice that but have already sent it back. Just be aware."
1,The Death of Culture,"In one and a half hours, alvin and the chipmunks effectively destroyed 200 years of progress in art, science, and mathematics."
4,Good but can be better,"Pros:- great value for money- the media buttons are very useful, and is compatible with iTunes. You have to install the Logitech software though.- works without installing any software from Logitech. Some functions like Media buttons won't work though.- Nice build, very sleek design.Cons:- No LEDs to indicate whether Caps lock, scroll lock, or Num Lock is on.- The special ""F"" key is sticky, just like the Caps lock key. There are times when I would press the F2 button to rename a file, and it brings up MS Word instead. What's worse is that there is no LED to inform you if the ""F"" key is on. You will only know by pressing it, then the key's status will be displayed on your monitor. They should've made this key non-sticky just like the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys.- The layout of the Home, end, Delete, Page Up, and Page Down buttons take getting used to.- Mouse is sleek, but nothing extra ordinary. You get two buttons, and one scroll wheel."
2,Classic design but functionally flawed,"I bought my Chantal kettle on sale. I'd never pay the full price for a kettle or a Chantal kettle, no matter how pretty it was. But this kettle is very pretty and on sale so I did buy it. I'm glad to read the other reviews . . . mine never whistled when it was boiling. Or it would whistle for a couple a weeks after a descaling, but stop mysteriously. This is a problem as I always left the room while the kettle came to a boil. I dropped the kettle on the floor after almost boiling it dry because the whistle didn't work. That bent the whistle and I've never gotten it to whistle again. I haven't looked into returning it for repair because I'm not sure that if it was repaired, I'd trust it to whistle. I still use it from time to time, but it really isn't safe because it doesn't whistle and the spout won't stay open when I pour water from it.It a lot of money for a kettle with a whistle that wont operate properly."
1,Real Problem Here,"I bought this kettle in September of 2009, so I've had it for about 1 1/2 years...not veryt long for an expensive tea kettle.Today I flipped up the whistle and the whistle ""innards"" flew all about. There are two tiny parts, a screw and a spring, both rusted out, which could easily have gone unnoticed back into the teakettle and have been a choking hazard. As it is there is no way to reinstall the whistle part and I'm lucky I found the spring, tenuously hanging from the spout cover, before it dropped back into the pot.Beautiful to look at, but it shouldn't have failed in this way and so soon after purchase."
1,Whistle Doesnt Work,"Had one of these that worked great for 20 years. I don't know what has happened to their quality, I have now been through 2 in the last 6 months because the whistles do not work consistently. I have wrecked two kettles because the whistle, which was closed fully and properly, didn't sound and they boiled dry. If you don't need the whistle, the kettle itself was fine."
3,Amusing - worth seeing once.,"Nothing I'd want to see more than once, but worth the current price of about$2. It's better than some of the other bloopers DVDs in that it doesn't give youlong, unfunny introductions. A word or two, and then the clips - that's a plus."
1,Editing would help.,"In his biography of William Bourn I and William Bourn II the author consistantly drifts from the topic.A prime example is even though William Bourn is in Monte Carlo during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Egan adds to his description of the events in San Francisco the following sentence: ""Even after the devestation of an earthquake that would have measured somewhere about 8.25 on the Richter Scale-to be developed in later years by Charles F. Richter of the Claifornia Institute of Technology...""Unfortunately this quote is not exceptional. If the author stayed with his topic the information Eagan unearthed on this important California family would require half the pages.Ferol Egan's ""Last Bonanza Kings"" is a book sorely in need of an editor."
2,Great for someone with NO experience,"This is basically a text book for a first year college student. The information was relatively vague. I was disappointed, but the book would be very beneficial to someone just starting in the business. I was looking for concrete examples and ""life saving"" ideas and this book did not offer that."
3,Not quite,I really love his other books I have purchased but was not impressed with this one. Does not have the details I was looking for but I think it would be great for a beginer. Just not quite what i was looking for.
5,Never leave home without it,"This tool transforms my DRebel XT's tiny little viewfinder into a usable one.At it's 1.25x setting it shows a clear picture with 100% coverage of what the viewfinder shows. At 2.5x, the coverage is much less but that setting is very handy for very critical manual focussing jobs.Remember to set your camera's diopter to it's default factory setting. Otherwise, flipping the angle finder between 1.25x and 2.5x magnification requires re-adjustment of the finder's diopter.Another big advantage of this little device is that it gives you the freedom to try exciting angles (hey, they don't call it the Angle Finder for nothing) without breaking your neck.The only minor downside is the initial learning curve in getting adjusted to the image shown by the finder."
