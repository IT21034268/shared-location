1,They sent me the solid brass instead,"They did not send me the high polished brass armor, but the solid brass. I dont like the text on the lid that sais ""solid brass"". It ruins the looks."
4,"ZIPPO ARMOR, POLLISHED BRASS","First, I don't smoke but I do like to have a source of fire on me and was tired of cheapo lighters. So I got this lighter the other day and it is everything I expected in a American made product.I chose an Armor Zippo in polished brass specifically for a few reasons-1. It's more heavy duty than the other Zippos.2. it is solid brass and has no finish to wear off except for a light clear coat.3. it will scratch and patina quickly and nicely giving it character and an classic old school look.It also functions exactly as it should.Only thing negative I can say is I wish the would have beefed up the hinge a little, it is the same as the regular Zippos.After 1 day of riding in my pocket with my keys and a a small flashlight it has a ton of fine scratches and even a few you could feel, it also holds fingerprints all over it but this is what I expected and wanted. If you want this Zippo to stay mirror smooth, shiny, and all pretty, this is not the one for you."
4,I think it is good for the test preparation,"As a GRE subject test textbook, it is detailed and well organized. I like the examples and practices most. Few mistakes were made in the book. It would be better if more practice tests were proposed."
1,cooked out!!!,"This seemed like a solid little thermometer...til it got used a couple times!! The face and dial turned so gray that you cannot read the temps, the little hand turned the same dark color as the gauge background making it all but useless. I am sending it back to Amazon!!"
2,Low grade product,"Product feels good when you get it. Put it in my grill and once it hit 500 degrees the coloring started to fade. Product works, but I became unease when a thermometer that has a top range of 700 degrees starts to show stress on the first use at 500 degrees within 30 minutes."
2,wind is the eneny,all it takes is one good windy day and say goodbye to your gazebo. I lost two of these within a 3 year period.
2,"""Murder, She didn't write""","I was looking forward to watching another season of Murder she wrote, only to find a series with almost half the episodes, not about Jessica Fletcher solving murder mysteries, hence only 2 stars; otherwise like with the rest of the seasons, it would have been 5 or at the very least 4 stars.Instead, basically half the episodes start of with ""Jessica Fletcher"" staring into the camera, addressing the viewer, with a ""Oh, hello... you know, that dog reminds me off..."" ""many of you might remember Dennis the jewellery thief"" etc.If you're like me and trying to collect the whole series, skip season 6, and collect the rest first. Hopefully season 7 - 12 is not like season 6.The ""Murder, she didn't write"" episodes are not bad, some of them are really good, but still, it's like they belong to another series."
3,"Good, but not his best","I am a monster fan of Eddie Izzard, and I saw this tour live in Oakland (a collection of houses) in 2010. That show was fantastic. However, this recording of the show is just okay. It is far from his worst (Circle!) but does not rise to the greatness of Dressed to Kill. Still worth the $$."
2,The description of the product does not say if there is captioning,"I came here to buy the DVD but the description of the product does not say if there is captioning, or subtitles. How nice. Two stars for leaving out this vital info . . . shafting the hearing impaired once again Eddie. What's up with that? You used to be kind and captioned everything. So, shall I buy knowing there may not be captioning? Hmm? Decisions, decisions . . ."
1,"Confusing, VERY confusing","I've played this game two times, and both times I wanted to go to sleep. The first time was with about 12 people, and it was decent, but slow. The questions often had to be repeated, and almost everyone was confused about the rules. The thing about this game is that only one person can win--they tried to make it so it's cutthroat, but it just doesn't work. The questions might have been good, had they been phrased in a less ambiguous way--my friend knew most of the music questions, after the answer had been said and she finally understood what it had been asking. Try this game if you want, but be warned that it may take the life out of a crowd."
2,There is finally an alternative,"I weighed in on this CD when Amazon first offered it, nearly 4 years ago, and I voiced my disappointment in the sound quality of such a good piece of music. Fortunately, The Ides have had a renaissance of popularity (they re-formed in 1990) and Rhino has issued the Warner Bros. albums, with some outtakes, on a 2-disc set. It has to be heard to be believed; seldom does a CD set transcend the best vinyl can offer. You have not heard Vehicle and Common Bond until you get this set. The catalog # is: RHM7834, on Rhino Records, and the full title is ""Friendly Strangers: The Warner Bros. Recordings."" It also has the track ""Melody"" so you are not losing anything from the (inferior) Magic Label release...I'd also like to add that I received more emails in response to that first review than for any other thing I have done on the internet; it was fascinating to hear from so many other music lovers!"
4,Vinyl replacement,"I have the original on an LP but wanted the portability of a cd for the car. If you like "" Crosby Stills Nash "" you should enjoy this cd."
1,ides of march - vehicle,vehicle is the only decent song on the entire album. no wonder the band never made it very far.
2,Dissapointed twice!!,"Came In as 2 passenger mats & no drivers side. So, where the gas pedal is it just barely fits around it and they can't lock in place cuz it dosent have the holes like is should. So, amazon sent new ones & same thing so I just kept them, didn't even have the original box. Paid $70 for wrong mats :("
4,Not really a Rugby Fan however...,I really enjoyed this Film. I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and thought this was a very well made film. It is light enough at a time when it seems so many films lately are so serious or dark. I think Eastwood is a top notch Director and this was no exception. Kind of an innocent feel good movie in my opinion and worth watching for sure :)
5,History & Drama on Steroids,"I knew about Aparteid and heard of Nelson Mandela. After watching this masterpiece, I understand to a far greater degree what an exceptional man Mr. Mandela is. The sports story intwined with the history is so well done. Morgan Freeman should have won and academy award. This is one for your DVD collection."
2,Evolution Self Cleaning Slicker Small-Medium Brush for dogs,"I thought the metal bristles were going to be softer and they are not, my dog runs every time I try to brush him.Would I recommend this product no , only if one's dog has tough skin."
5,Brush,Excellent product. Works great on short hair lab. Removes loose hair in a jiff an is easy to clean when done.
4,just what i needed,looks like they will do the job. identifying all of my loose keys.i have duplicates and sooooo many i don't remember what they are for. these should do the trick.
4,Nice phone,This phone works well and is a good value. The reception is very good and the caller ID and answering machine features work great and are easy to use. I highly recommend this phone.
4,Amazing little Camera,"I got this camera a couple of weeks ago. It is amazing.the picture quality is very good. So far all has been good but to be honest i have had one glitch. It seems that when i take photos on low resolution they keep coming blury, this is due ot that this cam is sooo sensitive, at that resolution , to vibrations. How ever when i bump the resolution up all that is gone.i do recomend this cam. i still have not explored all the options :) but the potential seems very very tempting."
4,640 too high price?,"I justed ordered the a640 from amazon for $419. Now, a day later, I see the a650 for $363. What happened? is the 650 not as good as the 640 or am i ripping myself off?Canon PowerShot A650IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom"
3,Was a good camera - but now a piece of trash,"I bought this camera in 2008.It had been running fine till date. The overall picture quality is good. Though it generates a lot of noise at low light . My previous camera, A80, didn't have this problem. I guess when they try to cram too much megapixels into the the sensor of same size, it ends up in high -sensitivity. The swivel LCD is the greatest benefit of this camera.After 2 years of good service, it suddenly went berserk. Initially when the flash was turned on, it just kept on showing the charging indicator and would never charge up. After that, that became ok, but now the image is very dark when taken in auto or the Scene modes. When taken in program mode, the exposure is ok, but the shutter speed is very slow. I took it to the repair and they told they have to replace the entire board(processor I believe) and it would cost me Rs 5000( $100) !!! What a shame.. I had always been a huge fan of Canon, and now I am totally let down."
4,Map Point for Dummies,This is a good source/tool for learning the in's/out's of this unique software
4,Mr. Wilson goes pop.,"Few individuals can produce a death-prog-metal band, a Marillion song, head their own prog band, collaborate and in some cases share venues with the likes of Fripp, Belew, Lifeson, Akerfeldt, and still have time to collaborate on a pop-rock project half a world away, and still do all these things in an excellent way!! Thank you Steven Wilson for your musical hyperactivity! I haven't listened to the 1st Blackfield album, so I won't make comparisons. This 2nd one is very good, unpretentious rock-pop music. Many layers, vast musical talent, beautiful melodies and vocal harmonies, great recording and production quality (typical Steven Wilson). One or two songs would fit in a Porcupine Tree album if they were more developed and expanded (especially This Killer). My one objection is that the album is a bit too short. If you enjoy Porc Tree soft side, you'll like this. I like it a lot!"
4,Arthritis Today,The original subscription and the automatic renewal were gifts to my son. He has been pleased with the magazine and has found many articles helpful to him in managing and coping with this disease.
3,Unstable and glitchy,"Bought this unit for two reasons because it was on sale and it was Sony. While the Picture is flawless and the sound is great, it doesn't always work as it should.I have had problems with this unit not reading some Blu-ray movies. I thought since it was a brand new movie maybe the movie was defective so I returened it to the store and got another new one. When I put it in it did the exact same thing. So I went and tried the movie in a friends Blu-ray player and it worked just fine, but still wouldn't work in the Sony. Along with that it has locked up several times on us while watching a movie. I then had to reboot the player and then find where I was in the movie again."
4,Very good indeed!!,I was spellbound! This is a very informative addition to my collection.In this set you have a little bit of everything that one who's interested in the paranormal could want!! This set is one that you will want to see time and time again. Recently my grandson had a sleep over where everyone pitched their tents on the back yard...we have 5 acres in the country...and it was great telling them ghost stories I had gotten from this set!!! It not only a big hit for all ages..but it looks great displayed on my DVD shelves...very well packaged and in A-1 condition!
3,Pretty and looks comfy.,"It is pretty and looks very comfortable, however, my golden retriever won't leave it in his crate. It is too soft (for a puppy) as he can pull it out of his crate and does. I find I have to ""make"" his bed every evening before he enters his crate. My fault, I should have realized it was more of a pillow than a crate pad. I'm going to put it away until he gets a little older and perhaps not quite so playful. He thinks this is a ""stuffed toy"" like many of the smaller ones he has. Would recommend for an older dog. Arrived in a timely manner from Amazon."
3,Quiet drama,"I love Tyler's work and never miss one. This is my least favorite. I found it a meandering story about a confused, sad young man.When I finished my copy and took it to the local library (I give all my books to them) they were delighted - said they had a long list of people waiting for it. I think most readers will have a higher opinion."
3,promise of the future,"I've enjoyed many Anne Tyler books and am now backtracking to her earlier works. I could only recommend ""If Morning Ever Comes"" if you are a fan, and are curious. This was her first book written in 1964 and Ms. Tyler has stated in re-reading it, her surprise it was ever published. I concur, as it moves along slower than anything I can ever remember reading, but does show some of the promise we find in her later epics. If you want to check out her best, you might try; The Accidental Tourist, Saint Maybe, Ladder of Years, or The Amatuer Marriage."
1,expensive,this set used to be like 120 dollars now its 600 dollars thats a rip off who would want to by that
4,Big project,"I bought this for my son's 8th birthday, because he had been wanting it desperately for a year. He usually puts together his Lego Star Wars toys in a day, but he's been working on this, off and on, for a couple of weeks now and is not yet done. But there are a number of smaller things to be constructed here, so he stops to play with them before moving on.If Lego Star Wars is your thing, you'll love the challenge. If you're a parent with low tolerance for a million pieces-parts scattered around, you'll have a lot to contend with here."
2,Promise not fulfilled,"Ms. Kumin seems to be depending on her reputation as a wordsmith to carry an original, but badly confused, mystery novel. My wife passed the book to me with the comment, ""You like mysteries, this book drives me crazy"". The assertion is true, but I feel her implied criticism is unwarrented. Good mysteries do not obscure by twisting the time sequence of each chapter so that the reader is confused as he reads sequentially. This is fakery and gratuitous reader manipulation. This could be a good read, but it is not. An editor should have said, ""Maxine, what are you trying to say? Where is the 'mystery'? Have you thought about the impression your book will leave on the reader?"" There are some good descriptions of the land right next to some pedestrian prose (unusual for a poet). If I were her editor, I'd give it back and tell her to rewrite it."
1,Are you guys nuts?,"I can't believe what I've just read. I fear for the future of the world if young girls believe that this is what the world of fashion is all about. Get with it! Working at a magazine has nothing to do with glamour and everything to do with hard work, 4 a.m. closings, and eating KFC every night for a week each month. I encourage every young girl out there who has read this tripe to try something a little more realistic. Even the Ricki Lake Show is better than this pathetic excuse for a book."
4,still not a classic,"This Scooby Doo movie is entertaining, but still isn't as good as the older, classic movies. My 11 year old daughter enjoyed it, but she also prefers the older movies. We will continue to view and purchase the Scooby Doo movies as they come out."
2,WARNING,"This book is a little too detailed unless you want your young child to learn about the birds and the bees and how babies are born. I'm all for sex education, but not for a 4-8 year old child."
4,Leah's favorite book in my 8-9th month of prego-hood,"This book was very helpful explaining to our 2 1/2 year old daughter what was happening and why my belly was getting larger. Both my husband and I are in the medical field and were happy that the language in the book uses real terms ""uterus/womb"". My daughter pulled this book from her book shelf more times in the last two months of my pregnancy then Elmo! Leah would say, ""mommy you utitis is big!"""
3,Usefulness of screen protectors,"I bought the WriteNow type, but I had to put in a star rating to get this review in. Here are my observations:1) this type of product is outrageously overpriced at [price] per pack. Its just plastic after all. Good to see prices coming down but it should be [price] not [price].2) The plastic makes the screen harder to read. It is though very helpful if you just use a strip at the bottom of the screen where you write in the Graffiti area. It gives a subtle grip to the surface that gives you more control in scribing, and I find I make fewer errors and write a lot quicker.So by just using a strip at the bottom I figure my [price] pack of plastic sheets should last a couple of decades.Go for the cheapest one you can find, like this brand. They sell one at [local store] also for [price]."
1,"Cheap price, cheap film",This flimsy film bubbles up and makes the screen fuzzy. Stay away and don't waste your money.
4,Great book for treadmill training!,"I used to run marathons a decade ago and now two years after having a baby I'm getting back into running. I love my treadmill but haven't really known how to use it for training. This book has a great set of training plans for recreational runners, people wanting to lose weight and competitive runners. It also has 5K, 10Km half and full marathon training plans. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because when read cover to cover it is rather repetitive, but perhaps that it is because most people will read the sections that apply to their interests and training goals. I checked it out of the library, but I want my own copy as a reference."
2,not so great,"Goods:Battle systemAnimationCons:Very incoherent, cliche', save the world plotBottom Line:maybe suitable for kids under 18..."
5,Outstanding!!!!!!!!,"Final Fantasy XIII may not be the best Final Fantasy ever, but, it really has its own special thing that can make you spend hours in front of your screen just to know what is going to happen next in the history. The game is not perfect because Squere-Enix must improve its fighting system, it feels...hmms let say boring, in special if you are a newby in the final fantasy saga and you are in front of a monster of 26.000vit just in the second chapter. But overall the game is outstanding."
4,great game at a great price,"i was never really a Ff fan from the beginning. i've watched the two movies that came out and exceeded all my expectations. based on the films, i took the plunge and purchased ff13 just cause it was priced so cheap. Quite honestly, i wasn't expecting much from it as i'm not a die hard RPG fan, but after playing ff13, i'm sold on the idea these RPG games are pretty entertaining and can't wait for ff14 to be released.As stated from other reviews prior, the game is quite linear but as a novice RPG player, it didn't bother me one bit. I finished the game in 45hrs and still mess around in Gran Pulse just to level up my players and rain hell on all the beast that chewed me up and spit me out the first time i entered Gran Pulse.All in all, at Amazon's price, it's a nice collection to my PS3 titles."
2,Disappointing Installment,"This game has trouble with plot continuity and storyline. I finally finished the game, after many starts and stops. I had to repeat battles over and over in order to win them. The difficulty level was either too easy or too hard. The beautiful graphics are the only redeeming factor."
5,i love it,"I've been a fan for many years of the final fantasy saga, them I've played almost all and they have always liked me. I loved the game, I agree that is a linear game but anyway I loved"
2,Disappointing,"This game is unlike the previous FF games I have played. It is *very* linear, with no ability to choose where you are going and what you are doing or which character is your lead character. And, worse, over half the time spent ""playing"" is watching cut-scene after cut-scene. After cut-scene. You will have a long cut-scene, followed by 1-2 fights, followed by another long cut-scene. Over and over and over. And oh, did I mention the cut-scenes over and over? And over and over and over..."
1,"Great Graphics, Terrible Battle system","Lets start with the very worst this game has to offer, with three characters, only one is at risk. Even with all of the available strengths other character possess, you will be in ""game over"" if that one character is lost. So, you will find battles very difficult or very easy, however you do not get to complete the story or enjoy a ""game"" only a repeated button mashing and changing paradiams. Don't even bother to start. Whoever developed this silly ""Battle system"" must be reassigned and put in charge of another highly repetitive and meaningless task, maybe sweep the parking lot.The Best, once again great graphics, but you can get that with God of War III, Red Dead Redemption or Uncharted, so, not really a reason to blow $60 on hours of repetitive button pressing, unless you enjoy thumb exercise.What does this all mean? To me, a loss of a great series of games. Square Enix, you have jumped the shark. I spend no more money on your games!"
1,Crappy 13,"As a relative new player in the Final Fantasy rpg's I came into this with high hopes. A visual stunner, but it is dragged into the mud by poor storylining, characterizations that repeat themselves too often and a general EMO style of looking at life. Gameplay itself is easy but leveling and altering the weapons and gear way too tedius. The game is bogged down by its leveling system that bores you too death by 'grinding'. The graphics are second to none, voice acting decent (Vanille voice and speeches are by far the most reviled), but it all wasted on a story that tries to hard to make you care about immature attitudes. Not worth the effort the devopers put into it."
1,Horrid.,"This was the last chance I was giving the Final Fantasy name. And it failed, horribly. I bought this on release day and traded it in 2 days later (I had to work or it would have been the very next day). This series last good game was the last one on the PS1 if you ask me, SquareEnix really dropped the ball, they spent so much money into devolping the world and graphics and characters visually that they had to reuse it all in a reboot game to get their time/money's worth out of this disaster."
1,One of the worse Final Fantasy ever,"I would say this was the worse Final Fantasy but I am told Final Fantasy II was worse. Graphically this game was beautiful, it's eye candy. As far as everything else it's just bad. Save you're money, move on, play an old Final Fantasy or pray that the series gets better."
3,"Too much glitz, not enough fun","This game feels like a very long tunnel. While the graphics are among some of the best I have ever seen, this does NOT feel like final fantasy. I hope they do better with their next title, or they will lose a lot of faith from the fans."
3,Beware of freezing problem,"I played the game in my old 1st generation PS3 for no more than 1 hour and now my PS3 is ruined. The blu ray drive no longer reads any disc. It seems to be a widespread problem with this game. Many other gamers either experience freezing cut scenes or ruined disc drive. I read that it is happening with some XBox users as well. If you have a old model of PS3, think twice before you play this game.By the way, I am a big fan of Final Fantasy and I love the game. I just hope that either Enix or Sony can make it work for unlucky souls like me."
4,Hmmmmmm...,I got this game about a week after it came out as an early b-day gift and i have already stoped playing it. I'm a bit sad because yes this game is linear. I'd also like to see towns and explore freely. I have heard that if you play more into this game it will get better and i guess I'll play it for another 2X for 2-3 hrs and see how it goes. But... I am a third way through the game and yet the only thing that amazes me is the graphics.
3,Your Not Missing Anything,Its very boring gameplay but the story for the most part makes up for it. It certains does not live up to Final Fantasy XII - X.
3,Not what you would expect of a Final Fantasy tittle,"Final Fantasy 13 is one of the most recent games made by Square Enix, Personally I give it 3 stars for the fact that this game is not what you would expect of a FF tittle I have played classic final fantasy games over the years and I was pretty disappointed with this game in particular, althought this game is pretty fun at times, but sometimes you can get stresed out personally I liked the game only at the begining after a few chapters the game becomes rather dull and rather easy since it plays by itself witch I found anoyng but I do recomend players to give it a chance as a game but as a FF game is not worth getting you hopes to high."
1,Get Demons Soul's instead of this,"Once again, Squaresoft has screwed up another FF game. Let's face it, the best ones are 7, 9, and 10 International Edition. That's it! I can't believe how they changed things so much in this game. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!! It was so good back then and now it's utter garbage. Squaresoft needs to just go back, get the same game engine, get a better story line and don't ever leave out summoning aeons. Also, leave the linear gaming out of it!!In the meantime, get Demons Soul's for the PS3. It's more challenging, you have more control over what you do and where you can go, it's free to play online and it's addictive (but again, challenging and hard...only for true gamers).Peace out!"
4,Can't compare to previous FF games,"Any FF fan boy would've already have bought & played this game. I pre-ordered it and basically bought my PS3 a year prior to the release of FF13 just for this game. When I first played it, I was a little disappointed. The story gets a bit confusing and wasn't nearly as good as the other FF games that I've played (FF7,8,10 for example).I was impressed with the new battle system though, it made it a lot more interesting and a lot more active! The graphics are captivating. The game is fairly easy, though some battles may be long and tedious.Though because of the story, I've put the game down for a while. Several months later, I've decided since I've already purchased it, I might as well beat it. As you get deeper into the game, the story gets more interesting."
5,Everything I Wanted!,"Deep, expansive, complex gameplay and upgrade systems. Days and days of playtime with exceptional graphics. Much of the gameplay is linear to serve the story, but it doesn't detract."
3,Classic Final Fantasy but just not as good as the others,"Compared to the other Final Fantasy games this one was good but past ones are better. The graphics are amazing only because of the PS3, but the game and story line are bland. The battles are good but not was as good as FFX. You only get to control the leader and their attributes and not the others. Its still a decent game but compared to its predecessors, it doesn't hold up to the brand."
1,very bad game,"this game was a disappointment. the love story was very bad. sarah was obviously too young and had nothing to do with the game. square enix obviously has to look back at the previous FF series like 10, 8 and 7 cause now its just a waste of time. summons are stupid, and battle system is boring. do not buy this game. its a waste of money. rent it or borrow it from a friend."
3,A Simplified Final Fantasy,"I'm only about 15 hours into the game, but as a long time Final Fantasy player/fan, I'm a bit disappointed in this round so far. They have dumbed down the system from previous Final Fantasy's. This might be good for first timers, but for us old timers, it feels rushed and simplified. For example, when you exit a battle, you entire party is healed. While this is ""nice,"" it take the challenge out of the game a bit. As long as you can complete a battle (which hasn't been too hard so far...), you'll have no real challenge. The story is pretty good so far, but a little slow. The world is very Final Fantasy-ish and I like that. Graphics are amazing too. Still glad I got it."
2,Eating Glass,"Playing through the first decade of chapters is horrendously boring. It is as if I am starving and eating glass. I want to like this game so much, but gameplay is nothing I was expecting at all. If you are new to the series and are expecting a lot in the form of an RPG or adventure-esque type, look elsewhere or wait until Versus comes out.The map is pretty much linear with a trail and some enemies in the way. Not much for exploration or environment interaction. I have not yet finished the game, nor can I stand to put it back into the PS3. It's sad to see a waste of $60 and even worse the disappointment of the game itself. I wish I could return it and just wait for Versus.FYI, playing the game for the story line isn't worth it either. Go watch a korean sci-fi drama instead."
2,A Final Fantasy Game you'll either love or hate,"I bought ff13 when it first came out a little over a year ago, and I would have to agree with the reviews that state that the game is repetitive and boring. I myself have stopped playing the game due to the repetitiveness of the game and the story line is not really engaging and difficult to follow. This is one game that you'll either love or hate. I myself don't hate the game but i sure don't like it. It would be nice if square would go back to it's roots when it came to the final fantasy series. i've read that the next installment of final fantasy is going to be online and according to the trailer the cinematics look good, but we will just have to wait and see how ff14 pans out."
2,Not worthy ti spend!,"I thought that this game was different from the other final fantasy games, but I was wrong. Nothing has change since final fantasy X, the game keeps repeating the same circunstancies. Final word a little bit boring."
2,"I am a fan, but this cannot be his work!","I feel like I have been cheated of a beautiful, Sunday, albeit cold and snowing afternoon. I am a big fan of Marquez but this book has hints that he wrote this, but only that. The characters are not well developed, I am not sure where the plot resides? At times, the writer seems to ramble on about nothing. I wonder why he wrote this garbage! I felt like I paid for a Pulitzer Prize winner and what I got is a middle school S.A. I believe that Marquez has lost his mind or he did not write this story at all."
5,Love and lust in Old Age,"This is a man who many would call sad and wasted, but in the end, he is true to himself and the women who he has shared his time with over many years. I would say that this is one of the finest and truest depictions of a ""monger"" that I have ever read and it read true for me as a man. Well worth the read."
3,Adequate but slow,If you're patient you'll be satisfied with the performance. If you're not you'll hate it. You'll need at least a 100 gig hard drive because Virtual PC is a space hog!
2,Jumping through hoops,"Honestly, wouldn't it just be nice to be able to use your MAC with all the software that's out there these days. Imagine if we couldn't call a friend because they were on Cingular while you were on Verizon. It is just ridiculous to me that instead of coding all the new versions of software as they are released to be supported on multiple platforms both Windows based & OS X, they come up with this ""workaround"".I bought it for two reasons only: so that I could access a stupid website I needed for work that didn't have all of its capabilities supported on OS X- it needed IE as its web browser; to install a software that I needed for work that is specific to the mortgage industry.In any event, does the workaround work... for the most part yes. Is it slow as hell- you betcha!"
2,WeatherTech W3 Dakota,I've happily owned other WeatherTech products. Not these. The W3 mats were specified for my Dakota. The fit is at best poor. I will be looking for something that fits better.
4,this is a one size fits most,I bought these for a 2007 Hyundai Tiburon. These partiucular mats are a UNIVERSAL fit. they are not an exact fit. These mats fit many makes and models. I brought the same brand for our other car and they are an exact fit for that car. The way to tell is to check to see how many different cars they fit. The ones I bought for our other car only fits that car.these mats are excellent and I recommend them. Just be aware that some are exact fit for one make and model and some are universal fit for many makes and models. I had to silghtly modify these universal fit mats to work better.
1,Bpg,I am very pleased with the spice stack/rack. I had looked extensively for something to fit the space I have to organize my spices. This is perfect for the smaller bottles and jars.
4,Better than I thought,"This spice organizer is great. It even comes with a set of labels to stick on - some labels are pre-printed with all the popular spices and there are blank ones to write in your own. I only wish all the spice slots were the same size so it could fit more of the standard sized ones, instead of having the back row for larger spices. My larger spices don't fit in there anyway because they are too long or fat!"
5,Great Space Saving Product,This space saving spice rack is great. I wish I had room for another one. When you have limited space this product really works great.
4,Not Quite the Space Saver,"I have owned this spice rack for several years now. It is a very handy tool to have in the kitchen. I think it works well and I've never had a problem with it.The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is quite bulky. It takes up more space than I had considered it would. However, I can place more spices in the spice rack than I would be able to in the amount of space the spice rack takes up.I'm trying to find a more efficient way to organize my spices and this product did not help me as much as I thought it would. If I had an abundance of cabinet space and several of these spice racks then that would be doable. However, I only really had room for the one spice rack I bought.I would totally recommend this product to anyone else, because it's well made and well thought out. I just need something a bit less bulky."
5,Perfect gift for the cooks in your life,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my parents who love to cook together. They love it! Mom reports that it stores more for the shelf space than the double-tier carousel they were using. They now have 18 5"" and 10 2"" bottles but it can still hold 8 more shorties. She also likes the rubber pads on the bottom of the unit so it doesn't slide."
1,disc doesnt work !!!,ive bought 2 copies now---both times the music tracks are all distorted !!! weird noises thoughout--- its prob combining dvd and audio on one disc- you`d think this billionaire phony could make a disc w out ripping people off - a product that works !!!!! through the haze of distortion the music sounds ok-- am i the only one who had this problem--w 2 discs now ??????????????
2,Sum of the parts doesn't make it!,"Hard to imagine taking the talents of Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen and coming out with this raucus and almost untunefull collection. The one great number is ""Eyes on the Money"". But you have to put up with a lot to get there. Very disappointing. I'll never buy a CD again I can't sample first."
4,"Love the Music, Hate the Format!","I thought I wouldn't like this project, but Bruce has sold me--it ROCKS! Especially ""Mrs. McGrath"" and ""O Mary Don't You Weep.""But...I had looked forward to listening to the new Bruce record on my Ipod...but if you make the mistake of buying the Dualdisc as I did, you will be stuck spinning it on a cd player ONLY. It won't play in your computer! I HATE DUALDISC! Now I'll have to worry about scratching up one side or the other when taking it out of the too-small cardboard package. I should have bought it on ITunes instead. I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DUALDISC! It is tool of Devil!"
1,Won't play,"It may be great, don't know. I love Springsteen and I love Pete Seger and bought this the day it was released. However, due to the way Sony formatted it (not normally formatted as the box says) it will not play on my computer."
5,Everyone would love it !,"This is one of the very best cd's out there right now , I play it so much will need a new one soon... Bruce has outdone himself on this one .. its totally fun , great for in the car, even if you can't sing thats ok tooI absolutely love this cd , one of the best ."
3,better than a lot of commercial stuff but predictable,"Maybe I'm being extra-hard on this album because I'm not a fan of Springsteen OR Seeger, although I was hoping that would change if there good songs on the album.It's not bad. I guess it's a relief from the pop and pop-country stuff that's on the radio these days, but I thought it was predictable. These are good songs, but I don't think the interpretations add anything beyond a lot of extra instruments and noise. Maybe that's what it takes to get people to notice that not all American music is Britney Spears? (Believe me, ""real"" folk and folk-rock never died; there are lots of excellent non-famous musicians out there who put at least as much thought and effort into it as Springsteen did). ""Breathing new life"" into this ought to be more than just repainting and turbocharging someone else's music."
1,SELF-INDULGENT....BUY SOME PETE SEEGER CD'S INSTEAD.,"Today's big names have gotten so lazy and self-indulgent. If you want to play these songs, Bruce, go ahead and play them...for yourself and your friends. Buyers, buy some Pete Seeger cd's."
1,IPod user!,"It's a shame that I can't buy this product solely due to its format, but that's the way it goes. Somewhat ironic since it would seem to also go against the spirit of both Springsteen and Seeger."
2,Defective Dual Disk.,"I LOVE the music but the cd, which comes with a Dual Disk warning/disclaimer doesn't play in my Sony cd player."
5,seeger sessions,"the record that made me a fan of springsteen! this album sets the bar high for all artists in my opinion. he gets to the roots of music with his interpretations of classic pete seeger anthems. it is gritty and real. beautiful orchestrations with piano, wood instruments and a brass section that will blow your mind. i love even more, the behind the scenes in rehersal where we get a glimpse of bruce designing the arrangements in his head as the band plays what he is envisioning! it is a treat to see how much music is driving him and how he brings it to life. a true artist, no gimmicks, just beautiful and up lifting compositions."
2,right band wrong voice,"The songs are timeless masterpieces, of American folk music. The band fits the songs quite well. Sprinsteen's vocals on the other hand, do not. He sings, like he is singing to a typical filled to the rafters, stadium mob. The material does not lend itself to that approach. I love the song Shenandoah, this is by far, the worst version I have ever heard. Had he used the sense and good taste, to mold himself to the music, this could have been spectacular. As done, it is just a horrible mismatch of stadium rock vocals on front porch songs."
1,Don't waste your money - I all ready did,"I saw the documentry on CMT and was very excited to buy the record. I bought it but I can't play it. Judging by the documentry, it would have been at the top of my playlist. It is a great concept and a great sound. If I was told upfront I needed new equiptment to play it, it would not have bought it. Shame on Bruce for allowing the record company to rip off his fans. Very disappointed. I TIVOed the documentry, so I guess we are even."
2,More for Springsteen fans than folkies,"This album was attractive to me for the prospect of one of my favorite entertainers singing songs dear to me from the folk music era. However, for one who had known, loved and participated in these songs for years, some of the arrangements & vocals did not work well."
1,The music is awesome but the CD is useless,"As another reviewer wrote, the CD does not work on the vast majority of players. We've returned the disk 3 times, but each one does NOT work in any of our players - they just skip mercilessly. Not worth the money. They need to offer *just* a CD, not the DualDisk."
4,Would have been 5 stars but...,"Unfortunately, this splendid album is available here only on the bad DualDisc format which you cannot back up onto your IPOD or other MP3 players. So you can't take the music with you. In fact, DualDiscs won't play on ""some"" cd players. Buyer beware.Update: I was finally able to back up the music to my MP3 player. The problem seems to involve dvd/cd combo drives. A plain cd-rw drive may work just fine as it did for me. This doesn't mean I'm happy with the DualDisc format - I'm not."
1,"""Dualdisc"" is deplorable system DON'T BUY IT","Though I liked the music, I found that when I bought the product I was not advised that ""The audio side for this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD...."" which reads INSIDE the package.... Music companies are so nervous to protect their monopolies, that prefer to hazzard customers than alow them use their products with all available technologies. This music can not be put into your Ipod, can not be read in a computer system, and worst of all, the disc is recorded on both sides, and packaged in a cardboard box, all this means that even when you buy it, one or boths sides are already scratched and de DVD won't read well on your DVD reader...DON'T BUY IT! IT IS NOT WORTH TO PAY TO PROTECT THIS RECORD COMPANY..."
5,Down Home Wonderful!,"I must say I have not been a BIG Springsteen fan - just liked him - saw him in concert and liked him better. Always some good songs - some so so songs ...but this is probably my favorite CD in a long time. It is good honest music - straight from your front porch - toe-tapping music. EVERYONE on the video part is having a great time - and these shots are fantastic - of the band, the farmhouse, Patti, Bruce, - just makes you feel happy! If you haven't yet - well buy it - you will love it!"
1,CD's are superior to records?,"I really like the music on this album. But the CD has stared to skip after only a few playings. None of my other CD's do this, and I have quite a bunch. I've examined the CD for scratches or dirt and it looks okay to me. In this case I guess we shall not overcome."
2,Creates bad attitude,"My 9 yrs. old daughter has Type I Diabetes for one year now. Over all, she had a good attitude about her Diabetes. We explained to her that, we, as a family, will do our best to support her and help her. I (her mother) told her that I am in it too. I am tying to cook good food for her, watch her blood sugar level all the time... I homeschool her, and it is a big help in monitoring her health and diet... Her friends know that she has it, they like to watch her doing her test...Sometimes she would get sad, and tell me how tired she is of those tests and shots... I comfort her and she continues on...In this book girl with diabetes uses phrase ""I hate to have Diabetes"" a lot. After reading this book my daughter started to use this phrase with anger.I regret that I bought this book for her... Or, at least I should have substituted this phrase with something more gentle when I was reading to her."
5,Game Time,"I am a one-song fan of this album, but I like that song so much that I think people should be able to play a little game to find it. This game was inspired by someone who studied a book which I reviewed and liked the book so much better than my opinion of it that he posted an opinion which said ""Barten is a retard."" I am just using a computer at the library now, which doesn't allow me to hear the samples taken from songs to see if my favorite song on this CD has been sampled so the bit played will include the line, ""Let's get real. Don't be a Cosmic Woo Woo."" If there is any justice in the world, whoever can guess which song that is in ought to be able to hear that line in the free sample and not have to buy this entire CD to hear it. However, I think you should buy the CD anyway, so you can hear it often enough so you won't forget it."
2,Huge Disappointment,"""Blurring the Edges"" is a really good CD that belongs right alongside efforts by Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette. This CD might as well be by Michelle Branch. It is very well put together and completely uninteresting."
5,Wow!,"In a day and age in which the music industry seems infected with lovely, whispy, airy voiced babes, it is a relief to hear a singer with heart, edge and an incredible power in her performance. I am a recent convert to Brooks' stuff, but what a conversion. I have always liked Ethridge, Raitt, Joplin...women with that hard edged voice and soul. Brooks is another of the powerful women of rock. She plays with the lyrics of a song. In Blurring, she whines about wanting it all...I need it...and makes you believe she does. It is a song that shows the insanity of being driven to want it all. In Deconstruction, she finds she has all she needs. Cosmic Woo Woo, is the anthem of all that is wrong with our flip flop society today. Bouncing from one belief to another, without ever really believing in anything. Damn, this is such good stuff. Like a good merlot, Meredith gets better with each new record."
2,"Stick to the ""regular"" Jason books","Jason X was a pretty fun movie. But after reading now all the books, I have to say no one has really figured out how to mesh horror and sci fi nearly as well as the movie managed. A lot of bogging down in pseudo-scientific detail here, at the expense of making most of the characters interesting. And the dialogue really stuck out poorly in my mind. Klunky and artificial. There was also a bit too much interest in setting up a sequal- the last quarter of the novel doesn't so much explain why things are happening as they do, as try to create a sense of mystery we're presumably supposed to be curious about.I'd read pretty much any of the ""modern"" Jason books again and enjoy. Jason X is off the the used book store for trade."
1,Garbage,"This album sucked. There were two tracks that were okay, but the rest was a waste of time, money, and electricity. Maybe that was his whole intent with a title like ""down with the scene,"" but I didn't find it appealing. Don't get me wrong, Kid 606 is good, just not this album. I would recommend ""who still kill sound"" or something."
1,No intentions of enlightenment. Buyer Beware! adn educated!,"I'm saddened that someone with such talent would use it for such a misguided purpose. This could have been an amazing project, but due to the lack of respect to God's word, I view it a complete failure. Although you can't get to heaven through works alone, you can condemn yourself by corrupting the youth. I would hope that you ask for forgiveness and salvation, crown the King, and rewrite this amazing project to glorify him. It would be more than worth it! You are amazingly talented, just temporarily lost!"
1,Not for children,"This book is NOT FOR CHILDREN. Bestiality and homosexuality are depicted, although slightly out of focus, (the Flood, p.56). A threatened homosexual gang rape is included (Sodom and Gommorah, p. 102). Violent events are graphically rendered, albeit in Legos, (e.g. drowning people in the flood and skeletons scattered around the ground when Noah and his family finally disembark; blood spilled everywhere when Cain slays Abel). Yes, these events are biblical, but they are not appropriate for children, particularly the younger ones for whom someone might unwittingly buy this book.Not only is the book inappropriate for children, but the mocking tone of the self-proclaimed atheist author is objectionable for anyone looking for a tool to teach or reinforce the Old Testament stories in a Christian setting.I just want the buyer to be fully aware of what he is purchasing-- this is not a children's Bible storybook from the local Christian bookstore."
5,amazing smell,"I bought this for my boyfriend around christmas. It definitely has the axe affect on me. I can barely resist my boyfriend when he wears this. The scent also lingers, a little goes a long way. For a moderately priced edp, this stuff certainly is top of the line."
3,works well,"This is a great pet shower. It's easy to use and seems durable enough. Theres a silver plastic piece that this product comes with, please be careful when you screw this onto your shower head. I stripped the threading on mine so now I cant use my shower head while this pet shower is attached. I have to take my shower head off everytime my dog takes a bath which is only twice a week, but it's such a hastle."
2,Good for about a year...then broke,"This shower was great for a year and it made washing our dog so much easier. But, after about a year, it broke. Not completely - just that if you took it off to take a shower, water sprayed everywhere unless we jabbed it with a screwdriver to get the valve to pop. Very inconvenient. The metal part that the hose attaches to also cracked, so obviously not the best of materials. Will be purchasing another brand."
1,Mine broke first use....poor quality,Mine broke the first time we tried to use it. Cracked and leaked around shower attachment end. The company has replacement parts on their website but I have no reason to believe it won't happen again so I'm not going for it.
1,Horrible!,"My name is Marie, this is my husband's account but I'm the one writing this review instead. I have been bathing my 10 pound Shih Tzu in our kitchen sink using the sprayer with our sink and I was worried I wasn't getting all of the shampoo out so after reading alot about this product I decided to give it a try. Got it within a week and my husband attached it to our shower with no problems but when we turned it on, there was hardly any pressure to it and I was disappointed from that so he let go of the button to spray and when he pushed it again nothing came out and we could hear loud noises behind the wall. Immediately, he let go and we had to go into the bedroom and take the paneling off the wall to see if a pipe had blown off and sure enough it did. We had water behind the wall, and had to call a plumber to come and fix it! I wouldnt give this cheap made product any stars if I could. I sent it back today which costs me almost $7.00 for that."
3,less tan expexcted,i was hoping that there was a better selection of homer and jethro murdering the hits on this disc. quality was good.
2,Nancy Drew 75th Anniversary Set,"I am somewhat disappointed with the games. They are misleading, slow and more than alittle hard to navigate. The quality is not what I expected and not what I have experienced before. I thought the price was quite good until I got the products. Now I am not so sure. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,second in the trilogy,"I purchased all three of these books together because I hate reading out of order. I was surprised in the sense that usually in books like this, one son is evil and one is good. This did not follow the usual pattern. I like the touches of humor, intentional (and sometimes unintentional) and the ending was a bit of a surprise. I would be very interested to follow up with the Dragon's Son and see where he winds up. Not the best I've ever read, but held my attention well and I went straight through all three books."
3,Good - Not quite what I was looking for,"I got this for my family this year. I have a 3.5 yr old and 1.5 yr old. This was over their heads. I'll pull it out again in a few years bc I think it contains solid and thoughtful devotions for the advent season. For this year, though, it just wasn't quite what I was hoping it would be."
2,Loving What Is,"My shrink suggested I read this book so I bought it and tried to read it. I've only been able to get through a quarter of the book so far because the main message seems to be: ""It's not what happened to you, it's how you look at what happened, so forgive the person who hurt you and let it go.""I guess that's a nice idea but I don't think that works under all circumstanaces. I mean if somebody hurt you very badly, it may be nice to forgive them but I'm not sure that helps to keep it from happening again.I would like to make sure I take better care of myself by keeping it from happening again and just looking at something differently doesn't really seem to do that. I've forgiven myself for letting it happen but I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. How does looking at something differently do that?"
4,My Review of Loving What is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life,This is a different way of approaching your trials. Loving what is is accepting with appreciation everything you experience and seeing it from a different perspective.
1,Practical to a point,"This book may help you get over the hump of self-imposed misery. It offers a few practical steps to help you analyze your own self-defeating beliefs, which is helpful to a point. In fact, many of the ideas she presents here are straight from Jesus' teaching (do not fear, love others as we love ourselves, don't rely on what we think we know, repent, forgive, etc.). Except that Jesus asks us to follow Him instead of ourselves, as Katie does. This path laid out by Katie cannot be sustained unless you die to yourself and become new in Christ.If you are looking for purpose, freedom from fear, healing, truth, unconditional love, and the ultimate guide to living, don't look here. Look to Jesus. He will show you the way. All you need to do is ask."
5,Excellent Work,"This is a great way to find inner peace. When you remove your beliefs, thoughts about yourself, thoughts about others, you feel free to experience the present, full love, and perfect nature of us human beings. The work is a great tool to be able to practice self-awareness and someday hopefully with these great books and day to day practice, we will be able to feel inner peace and love."
5,hard to describe adequately,I can't get enough of Byron Katie's work. I learn from everything she writes and speaks. I have already read her other books and still continued to learn form this one. Mostly through dialogues with people and practical examples she shows the beauty of the process of 'thework'. Definately life changing.
5,Another great fan of what is,"I went to hear Byron Katie speak and then bought this audio book. Much more useful than the written book because you can listen to people experiencing the work for real and get the full impact of how looking at what you believe and why you ""choose"" to believe it can change your life.Some may find Katie a little brash, but then that gives you something more to look at right there. Even my kids listened and prospered from the wisdom of accepting that what is what is supposed to be. As Katie herself often implys, everything is an oportunity to do the work. And it does change your life."
1,Weird,"I've participated in all kinds of new age kind of stuff. Gestalt, EST, Hypnosis, etc. and have been able to find value in most of these. However, these tapes are weird. The basic idea: that expecting that things should be different and feeling badly about this isn't going to help an individual is straight forward enough. I expected more, but if the only thing these tapes had done was reinforced this idea in a memorable way, they might interesting enough. However, they failed to even meet this minimal standard. I was disappointed. Here are the four questions: 1. Is it true? 2. Can you absolutely know that it's true? 3. How do you react when you think that thought? 4. Who would you be without that thought?. The four questions are presented with the self important phrase ""the work"". I can imagine a simple discipline consistently applied could be worthwhile, but I don't see this as the one. The book got some good reviews, you might check out those reviews to make up your own mind."
4,Just ok,The book was not the shape as described. I have had much better book conditions with the description given. Lots of notes on pages and underlining. Very Worn. I am disappointed for the price as well.
1,Not my cup of tea,I've listened to many self help CDs (and tapes) over the years.I was really looking forward to this set. That's why I bought it. This set just doesn't come to the point quick enough for my taste. I got through the first CD wondering when they were going to get to the point. I find it hard to follow when they say they are going to have you fill out forms and such. I'm listening to the CD in my car . . . I would imagine that others do also.Not a very good use of my time. They didn't make it so that I would want to go looking for it. Wish I could find someone else who would benefit from it.
2,NLP all over again,Deja vu all over again with this rehash of NLP techniques. Disappointing as it was recommended highly by a colleague.
2,Words repeated too often.,"My wife bought this game for us as a gift (and we both enjoy the non-electronic version), but after only a few games, words started repeating -- and kept repeating. There may be 2,200 words in there, but we've only seen a few dozen (and we keep seeing them).We've given up on it. The regular version is still a winner, but the electronic game is junk."
3,nightanddayonline.com CD RELEASES,"""Time Won't Let Me"" is the first track on Bill Turner & Blue Smoke's new release, ""Mississippi Maserati Breakdown."" Setting the table for the musical spread that follows, it's a song with a unique, yet familiar sound. Unique because it's retro 50's rock mixed with folk picks that the local scene hasn't seen the likes of in a while; familiar because we may have heard it all before. Turner was a bandmate of Bill Haley's from 1974-1977, and the CD mixes original work with previously released classics. All in all, this album capitulates big ideas with highly conceptualized elements. Anyone who likes 50's rock or folk music will definitely enjoy the 11 carefully selected tunes.Justin BachStaff Writer, Night & Day Magazine NJ July 6-19, 2001"
4,"Not a movie soundtrack, but an excellent New Age CD","Medwyn Goodall has released over 70 CDs which express his love of nature and many ancient cultures and legends. This CD is a soft, laid-back collection of songs which is one of many Goodall has done based on the Athurian legends. All of the music on this CD was composed, arranged, produced, performed, recorded and mixed by Mr. Goodall. He uses harps, guitars, mandolins, woodwinds, horns, strings, panpipes, flutes, percusion, and synths along with sounds of nature to produce nine tracks of relaxing music that really capture the mystery of the King Arthur legend. He has done many other CDs that are more upbeat than this, but if you are looking for an hour of peaceful reminders of the magic of medieval England and Camelot, try this CD."
2,i threw it out,The Vet told me to throw this out. It has dangerous ingredients. I replaced it with a fish oil to promote better skin and stronger paw pads.The oil has been great
5,Great Speakers,I am very happy with these speakers. It's exactly what I expected from Sony. These are very well built speakers. They are heavy and sturdy. They are attractive in appearance and make any well decorated room look good. The Bass is good along with the high and low tones of music and movies. I'm also happy with the low price I paid online for these. The Amazon price was way better than going to a brick & mortar store.
2,Disappointed,"These speakers are 1 year old to the date. Speakers blew out and sound is cracking while playing anything. I called Sony and they told me the speakers with the P at the end of the model are european models and not covered under US warranty. Basically, we are S.O.L. If we call a European phone number they might be able to assist. No 800 number for US inquiries.Will NOT purchase anymore sony speakers and will do my best at staying away from sony products altogether!!!!"
4,Nice,"Very good sound but nit quite as powerful as would have liked. Is great for use with tv for the surround sound, very realistic. Definitely would recommend!"
1,BROKEN AGAIN...HIGHLY UPSET,"I would give this product a better rating however seeing that the first shipment was broken, had a replacement sent to me, and those are broken also...I can only give 1 star. Looks like I will have to make another call."
5,Great Speakers,"Well, I got these from the PXBX for $85 a peice. These are truly some valuable speakers. The bass respone really goes down to 25hz. If you wire correctly. They are unbelievable. Bass is felt in my chest. If you cant feel it, blame room acoustics. Idk if the highs reach 50kHz. They stop around 19kHz. But thats very high. Music is detailed to almost every tone. When loud enough it can blow the house down. I've had neighbors think i was having a party. you can here 400ft. down the street. You have to buy. Buy atleast 16 gauge wire. It WILL make a difference. Regardless of brand name. No need for a sub unless it can go down past 20hz. Great product. THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE IS UNDER RATED. 25Hz-50kHz. Air comes 4 or 5 feet out of the duct hole. Sometimes it will reproduce down to 20hz. Not loud. I love them. Do not run a 20kHz test with the volume up. Just warning you. You'll fry the tweeter. Haha."
4,great speaker for the value,This speaker sounds really good. If you add an equlizer($70 -behringer) and a woofer($80- mine is yamaha) you got the perfect set-up. The bass is good enough even without the extra woofer but a woofer fills up the sound...and please don't tell me that some more expensive speakers can do better at 'lows' than a woofer...Anyway they do have a lot of power...I use a 2x110W amplifier and 2/3 of the volume to max is already too loud (without distortion)...
2,Poor Ergonomics,"Based on the rave reviews I ordered one of these. The dual blade feature and the material of the blades are great. However, the ergonomics of the integrated round handle parallel to the blades are poor. Squeegeeing the walls and shower door while, for all intents and purposes, holding on to the blades is awkward. Cleret makes a conventional squeegee with a handle, but it has only one blade and is less robust. I would suggest that Cleret design a dual bladed squeegee with a conventional handle--that would be the best of both worlds. In my opinion, this squeegee is an excellent example of form over function."
3,A pleasure of a story!,"In the great tradition of old-time English legends, this book drew me in slowly, delicately and surely. The pace is calm and gentle. I grew really connected to the characters; was interested in them and their well-being; missed them when I finished the book. The story is well woven. The descriptions of the gardens are beautiful - like a guided tour. I recommend the book to people who enjoy reading about gardening, a hollistic, earth-based approach to life, and a good story."
4,would buy from seller again,"The games is grate my son loves it. It had a few marks on it but we got it fix. Took three weeks to get it, it wasn't a big deal as long as my son is happy i'm happy"
3,Not for destructive dogs.,"I bought this for my one-year old French Bulldog because she needed a tough bed that could not be easily destroyed. Well, after the very first day, she managed to not only unzip the outer casing, but also tore the egg crate stuffing into a thousand pieces. Thankfully she didn't destroy the cedar part. So, rather than throwing this product in the trash, I replaced the eggcrate pad with a standard pillow and zipped it back up with the cedar. I now use it for my other dog (Yorkie) who loves it!!! He is not destructive like the Frenchie, so she get's his old bed instead of the new one now. I would not reccommend this product for a dog that is either extremely clever or destructive as it only took mine one day to figure out the zipper. I would reccomend that Pet Gear redesign the zipper so it locks into the closed position. Otherwise this is a good product."
4,Excellent beginning actionscript,"If you have an understanding of Flash Design, but need help getting intoactionscript functions and event handlers, this is a good book for you.I bought the book because I needed help creating a simple email form,which this book has a lengthy chapter on. The author is very thoroughwith explaining how the actionscript works logistically, and obviously nota fan of Flash Animation. It took me awhile to grasp some of the conceptsbecause I was so used to designing with a non-actionscript approach.My only complaint is that the book went by to quick, and wanted to see more oncontrolling movie clips, and HTML integration."
4,Wonderful backpack!,Should have purchased this backpack sprayer years ago!!! I have been using the handheld type which routinely broke.
1,More controversial would've been better....,"Don't get me wrong. Garth brooks is very talented and has a great voice. However, this is basically a commercial sounding pop album...and not a very good one at that. There are a couple of good songs on here, especially the first track. Other than that, it is an overproduced, adult contemporary type sound. From the looks of the cover, you would think this CD would have a harder edge to it. Perhaps Garth should have leaned more towards hard rock, or even a heavy metal soundtrack. Hey, I believe that Garth Brooks has a good enough voice to do it. That would have got my attention! All in all, this is quite a dissapointment. If you find this in a bargain bin somewhere, it is worth a listen for a couple of bucks. Other than that, only buy it if you're a die hard Garth Brooks fan."
5,A Great Change Of Pace for Garth!,"I have been a Big Garth fan since he started, I have all of his albums including his new one. Garth Brooks in the Life Of Chris Gaines is a nice change of pace for Garth. It is nice to see him try to broading his horizons and being more than 'Country"". I would suggest this to any Garth Fan or if they never listened to him to try this album out. My Favorite Tracks are: 1.""It Don't Matter To The Sun"" 2.""Right Now"" I like the other songs too!"
1,"Its dumb, he is throwing away the people that put him #1",He is disregarding and setting back all his fans that put him in the top spot of country music. This is one fan that fills a sense of betrayl. I will not be buying the CD or watching the movie.
1,GO TEXAS!,"First a review of a review by Texas (below). You hit the nail on the head, Garth did ruin country. Loved your theory on his next Latin project. This guy's about money and that's it. You can't take away his marketing ability, in that he's great. As a musician he is poor. This Chris Gaines thing is proof of that - absolute. Can't wait for his La Vida Loca cd due out soon no doubt."
1,Identity Crisis?,"Brooks has been one of the leaders of a pop-country movement that has practically destroyed the form by replacing good music with good marketing. Although one can understand why he would want to be someone else, Garth cannot stop being himself. This time, though, he is going to find the sledding a little bit tougher. Pop music is already loaded with frothy fluff, and as for that new ""look""--big deal. The only thing weaker than this album will be his ""acting"" in that upcoming flick, no doubt financed by himself. Move over, Michael Jackson, there's a new weirdo in town."
1,Mid life crisis?,"This album is embarrasing for Garth Brooks. His attempts to sound fresh and modern wind up sounding like a parody of groups like N Sync and The Backstreet boys.His version of Come Together was scary on the tv special, and the album cut is just as bad. Since when did an Oklahoman say, ""Brotha"" instead of ""Brother?""The really sad thing is this concept could have possibly worked. But instead we get forgetable songs done in a parody style."
5,He is still the best,I think this CD adds a good twist to Garth. I love his country CDs and I love this one. Not too many artists can sing different types of music and have the same great affect on people as he does. I found this CD to be another hit for him.
1,A bullet to the foot,"Garth Brooks has never been particularly endearing to me, but this horrid ""concept"" album just about kills any empathy I could have had for him. The idea is addlepated for openers, and the music... feh. Brooks is a decent singer and songwriter in his genre, of the pleasantly-forgettable mold, but when he tries to write straight-ahead pop songs he comes off as crassly derivative and horribly insincere. Coming soon to cutout bins across the land."
3,A longtime Chris Gaines fan responds,"I've been a big fan of Gaines since he first came out years ago. His music meant a lot to me during some rough times in the 80's. Speaking as someone who buys everything he releases, I have to say that I'm a little disappointed in the Greatest Hits package. First of all, though the collection probably includes Gaines's biggest sellers, it ignores most of his best music: the album cuts that have meant so much to so many of us (songs like ""The Shameless, Dancing River"" and ""Lost Without my Hat""). Also, they should've included some unreleased bonus tracks for the faithful; I already own all of this music on the original albums (I only bought the Greatest Hits to replace some of my vinyl LP's). Finally, I don't think it was such a good idea to invite a former country star like Garth Brooks to play on the CD. After all, Chris is already perceived by many as something of a has-been. Does he really need to link himself with a real has-been?"
1,Another Garth Gimmick,"Just another gimmick by Garth Brooks to push product and marketing rather than taking the time and effort to make compelling music. No doubt each of these songs was put before a focus group for approval rather than put together to make some sort of artistic statement. Like his attempts at ""country"" (and baseball) Garth's atempt here fails miserably."
2,Please... Stick To Country..,"While Garth can compose great country & western, This cd tries too hard to duplicate a sound that to put it mildly, has past. Legend? Perhaps time will tell. Garth seems possessed trying to unseat Elvis as the # 1 selling artist of all time. It's a long climb & country should be the path, not this."
4,a huge talent expands further,"OK, let me first say that I am not a big fan of country music, however, I have always loved Garth Brooks' music. He shows an eclectic range in his own genre (country), and this work of his proves that he is a true talent, regardless the type of music he sings. This work reminds me of Kenny Loggins or Michael Mc Donald in some ways, and is very much reminicient of early 70's focus more on the songwriter/storyteller than the in your face music of today.If you are a fan of Loggins, Mc Donald, James Taylor, or even Elvis, you'll like this CD. Garth clearly shows that he can wear many hats, not just a cowboy hat."
3,"Good, but not Great","I enjoyed this recording for what it is; a hugely popular entertainer wanting to try something different for a change. I am a HUGE Garth fan and to all of you out there who say he strayed to far he did warn us before the release. I think he is successful in his new role as a pop star, but I greatly anticipate the next Garth release ( not a Christmas album! )"
1,Risk-Free Crossover,"The content of this album is poor. The obviously strained vocals and mediocre songs make for an overall unimpressive showing from the country king. Leave the lure of crossover music to the women of country, Garth, and give your fans another album with material that you can handle."
5,Surprisingly Artistic,"This is one of my favorite albums! The music is unexpectedly original and entertaining to listen to. The track ""I get lost"" is a beautiful accoustic ballad that is emotionally moving. The whole album is terrific!"
4,Different Garth,"I think the best way to look at, and listen to this cd, is to try and get over the fact that it is Garth Brooks. His country fans may be dissapointed in it, but looked at in a non-country way, it is a good album. Some songs have the unmistakable Garth 'voice', while others it is hard to believe it is Garth. This album sure did confuse a lot of people, and to my knowledge, there hasn't been a movie about ""Chris Gaines"" or a follow up album either. But, getting over the confusion and definate 'strangeness' of this concept, the songs on this album are pretty good rock/pop/r&b fare. The 20 page booklet really only adds to the mystery, with its photos of Garth not looking at all like Garth...I can't imagine any other context in which Garth would consent to wear a pair of tights and sport a 'grunge' hair style."
2,Not so much bad as just not good,"I have listened to this cd several times. I say to myself, ""what a waste of time and money."" But then I read all the positive reviews and think maybe I dismissed the CD too soon. But after several listens I still don't feel excited about this cd or any of the cuts on it. It's not that they are bad so much as they are just not good. Perhaps I'm missing something. And maybe, just maybe, Garth's fans are hyping the cd up to keep from admitting that the cd is just not good."
2,"Good start, horrible finish","I can relate to most of what I've been reading here. Anyway, while I started using words like 'genious', 'daring', etc., from 6th song on it turned to 'American high school pop-rock', 'Rick Springfield rip-off' (and I already think Springfield sounds like 'American High School pop-rock), etc. Garth shows his talent and will to broaden his musical horizon, but doesn't live up to his own high standards (he sets for his country albums). I give him 5 stars for the first 5 songs, and will forget he ever recorded the rest of the album."
2,One question comes to mind - Why?,"Why in the world did Garth do this album? The stand up display says that the album represents rock over the last 15 years. I don't remember rock being this boring and soft over the last 15 years. This album is really hard to review. It has good production value and technical sound quality. They did a good job with stuff like balance and equalization. But it seems to end there. No heart, no emotion, no feeling. And no rock! I thought this was supposed to show Garth could rock!?!?!?!"
5,EXCELLENT WORK.,"This is an absolutely wonderful collection of songs. I have listened to this everday since I purchased it, even my six year old enjoys most of the tunes. I am unable to pick one song as my favorite, because the enitre cd is awesome. Keep the music coming Dave."
4,Veil Instruction,Sarah is very good at giving directions and then putting together little routines for their use while belly dancing. I love to use the veil while dancing.
4,Hope For New Worship,"Phil Wickham has provided a much needed youthfull spark to the Christian worship scene. His passionate lyrics and originality is what is he brings across in his latest self titled album with songs like ""Grace"" ""Divine Romance"" and ""I Will Wait for You There"". If you're looking for some new great music, this is it. Look for Wickham's music to be making moves into the popular Christian Radio as his talent is realized. Also, a great compliment to this CD check out Jason Morant's latest album titled ""Open"". If you want to check out full length songs by these guys check out their myspace: [...]"
1,DID NOT WORK WELL,"This unit is not a good buy at any price. And forget support, Lexmark will not help you. They want your money and sell you junk!!!! Stay clear of this and ALL LEXMARK printers"
1,Works horribly with Mac. Have spent 20 hrs with tech support,Had this for 2 yrs (I'm a low usage customer) using with Mac Leopard. About 3 times a year it falls off the network and the software that should simply scan and re-connect doesn't work. Every time we re-install drivers and re-connect the USB and re-run the set up and it still doesn't work. Every time we call Lexmark tech support and they spend 1-2 hrs fixing the problem. Life is too short -- do not buy this product. Horrible mistake.
4,Great Lexmark Printer but - uses ONLY Lexmark cartridges -,"I have owned this Printer/scanner for a few years. I had no problems with Genuine Lexmark Cartridges but recently I bought much cheaper alternatives which I cannot use. The Printer will NOT let Me print unless I use NEW Lexmark cartridges. Refilling My old cartridges also doesn't print..Recently I have had paper feeding issues. Either ALL the paper goes thru or its a paper Jam..which is driving Me crazy. The cartridges were reasonably priced when I bought this Printer but when I needed New cartridges, the prices had somewhat increased..The scanner/copier works great. so, apart from the paper and cartridge issues.. a great printer.Lee Noonan Australia"
1,it sure didn't work for us,"We purchased this printer last October and printed about 8 sheets thinking it was going to be a winner. It jammed on the next page and has been out of commission since. We can't find any hint of a jam or paper. We removed the cartridges and put them back in. We unplugged it and left it off to ""rest."" It simply won't work, won't scan, won't do anything. I have tried reading everything on their support site and nothing has been helpful.I am not as sophisticated as an IT person but I am used to computers and networking and basic troubleshooting. I should have returned it to the store where I purchased it but kept thinking surely whatever was wrong was simple to fix. I guess I was wrong. After giving up on the printing end I decided at least we had purchased a scanner - can't get it to work either.I think this is the last LexMark for me."
2,Installation Problems,"This installed fine on my desktop computers but Lexmark's installation setup crashed my Acer Travelmate notebook over and over with Blue Screens of Death. Lexmark's troubleshooting faq was no help. Finally solved the problem myself by doing an uninstall followed by a Windows Restore and then doing the install in Safe mode with Networking.The printer is kind of heavy and clunky. Place it somewhere solid, otherwise it will shake and vibrate whatever its placed on.The Install has a lot of BLOATWARE associated with it. Do the Custom install and you can eliminate some but not all of it. No easy way to just install a driver without all the bloatware.But it is one of the most economical wireless solutions available."
1,Waste of time if you have a Mac,"Bought for $30. Turns out it was a fair price... It works OK with Windows PC, but a bit temperamental at times. Can't get WiFi to work with Mac at all. Online search showed ongoing problems for Mac users for over a year now (feel free to google it). Lexmark appears unwilling or unable to supply Mac drivers that work. After what I paid I view it as a disposable printer. Was it worth $30? Probably. Would I pay $30 again? Very doubtful. Final advice would be to rather look elsewhere if you have a Mac until Lexmark wakes up. Pity..."
2,High priced ink and constant error messages,"I bought this printer because it was what I could find at the base BX while oversees and I needed a printer. I don't like this printer mainly for the cost of ink cartridges; Lexmark has made it so an average non-techie like me cannot use aftermarket ink cartridges or refill those of a Lexmark brand. My second reason is I've had a ""low color ink cartridge"" error displayed, and repeated back to me everytime I print something, for the past 6 months (not an exaggeration).I would not reccomend this printer. However, it does work fairly well which has kept me from upgrading to something less costly to maintain."
5,Nice printer,"We're very happy with this printer. It was easy to hook up and the wireless capability works wonderful from all over the house. The print and copy quality is excellent. Haven't tried printing pictures yet. It's simple to use, we love it. Ink cartridges are affordable, too."
3,telesteps,"the telesteps are a great way to manage space, however the are kind of hard to manage if you are a woman, They are heavy but they do get the job done. I'm glad I have them. (I am a woman)."
1,Dead Roses Arrived Today,"My husband ordered these roses for our anniversary. Please be forewarned, you have to be home to accept delivery!! I was, but I guess the FedEx guy couldn't be bothered with knocking on my door, so he said (via doortag) he would redeliver on Monday. However, unknown to me, he actually left them at my apartment office. When they didn't arrive Monday AM, I called Fedex, who said they were delivered to my apartment office on FRIDAY!! I picked up, and they were brown and dried out, straight to the garbage they went! Neither Falcon Farms nor Fedex would take responsibility, now my husband is out $30. Do not order from them!! Other floral delivery companies may be more expensive, but at least the quality and higher level of service is there."
5,Bridal shower hit,"This was a big hit at the bridal shower. I put together a package with gingerbread mix, bowl, apron, those types of items to bring it all together. The book was passed around and everyone got a kick out of it. this is my new favorite bridal shower gift."
4,Good Book,Good book but took a very long time to arrive. Very humorous and still actually has positions you can try AND the recipe for ginger bread cookies.
4,"Entertaining, at least","Bought this for my husband's stocking for Christmas. It's an amusing little ditty. Not that you would read it over and over again, but depending on your sense of humor, it's a good coffee table book. :)"
4,battery shaver,I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It is very easy to use and replacing a battery seems better than having your shaver die down in a middle of shaving and having to finish using a razor.
2,TO MUCH HYPE AND NOT MUCH INFO,"THE BOOK RELIES MORE ON COMMON INFORMATION AND ALWAYS GOES BACK TO WHAT HIS RICH DAD HAD SAID WHILE HE WAS GROWING UP. IT HAD A FEW ITEMS THAT WERE O.K.,BUT WITH 335 PAGES IT SHOULD HAVE SOME IDEAS. THIS IS MY SECOND BOOK THAT I HAVE READ BY MR. KIYOSAKIAND IT IS NOT REALLY MUCH DIFFERENT FROM ""RICH DAD,POOR DAD""I REALLY BELEAVE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HIS RICH DAD WRITE A BOOKBECAUSE HE ALWAYS USES HIM AS HIS REFERENCE. TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOOK HE TALKS ABOUT HIS WIFE KIM AND HIM BUYING A FEW RENTAL HOUSES AND THEN TRADING UP UNTIL HE GETS A LARGER GOV'T BACKEDAPARTMENT BUILDING. THEY THEN RETIRE...MAKING $40-50K A YEARHE HAS DONE NOTHING SINCE THEN IN THE APARTMENT/RENTAL BUSINESS.NOW HE JUST WRITES BOOKS AND LECTURES ON THE CIRCUIT. I RESPECT HIM FOR BEING IN THE SERVICE. BUT THIS BOOK COULD BE REDUCED BY ABOUT 200 PAGES AND STILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT."
5,Enjoyable Reading,"After reading some of the other reviews, I just want to say this is not 'How to Retire Rich for Dummies'. This book was my first in the Rich Dad series, so I cannot compare it to the others. Personally, I found this book enlightening and inspiring. The author is writing to intelligent individuals to spark desire and motivation, not teach step by step instructions. I am planning to read other books by this author. For those who say the author is trying to sell more products -- might I suggest going to your library and borrowing them instead."
5,Great Value,This is a great value for this product. I have two dogs so this will last me half a year but it is the best price I found. Delivery was quick also.
5,Great product,It is a great products for different kind of dogs. Our dog has a sensitive stomach and Pet-Tabs Plus goes well with his tummy.
2,Cheap replacement,"Bought several packs of Glad Rags in 2009 to avoid using disposable pads (cost and environmental impact). Very happy with them until after many washings, they began to fray. Re-ordered items in 2011 were not like ORIGINAL soft but sturdy fabric like brushed twill. More like thinner flannel that curled as soon as washed and didn't stay in place. Still a savings over disposable pads but won't buy again. Will try another brand."
5,Good organic pads,I love that they're organic and good for you. Keep them soaking in a bucket and stains aren't as much of an issue.
3,nice pictures,"I received this book without really knowing the content. I was hoping for ""shabby chic"" and it was more dark colors and country mixtures. If you are not looking for white and pastels then I think you would enjoy this lovely picture book."
5,It just works!,"What can I say, this corkscrew just works! It does all of the heavy lifting for you. You simply screw it into the cork and as you turn it lifts the cork out of the bottle for you. No pulling or fussing, just a few easy turns and you're done. The first time I used it I noticed that a few bits of the cork got into the wine, but after that I haven't had any issues."
5,At last!,Five corkscrews occupy my kitchen drawer.Only this one works for me without need to add a pliers operation.
2,It's Plastic!,"Thirty dollars for a plastic corkscrew was a bit much. But, we've used it carefully, and it works. I reread the listing and nowhere is plastic listed."
5,Love this,This is probably the easiest cork puller I have ever used. It works every time and the cork is easy to remove from the screw. I have even used it on broken corks in champagne bottles. Just make sure you cover the champagne bottle with a dishtowel when using the corkscrew.
4,I like the portable one better.,"I purchased this corkscrew because I have a Screwpull travel corkscrew and love it. I should just have gotten another one of those. While this one is very good, the portable one (in my opinion) works better."
4,I have more of a Question?,"Ive read all the reviews. It looks good, sounds good, good price. But I have a question about removing the Cork from the Screw after it has been removed, I dont find any discussion of this. Ive typically had a very difficult time removing the cork from the screw, and the cork is slippery from the wine making it nearly impossible to grip to unscrew the screw. This company has another model which supposedly removes the cork from the screw, tho the price is double, but would probably be worth the extra money if this model has no way to remove the cork. Can someone with experience with this model post a Comment re this issue? LATER: I purchased the more expensive model that takes the cork off of the screw after removing the cork, and it works very well, I would definitely recommend that one, it is worth the extra cost to eliminate the hassle of always struggling to get the cork off of the screw."
2,Works until the plastic breaks,"This wine opener works as advertised. However, the plastic is not very strong and breaks too easily on a normal wine bottle. While I like the idea, I now need a new wine opener and won't re-purchase this model because of the flimsy plastic."
2,nowhere near as good as the first.............,"This one surprised me, it wasn't nearly as good as the first Moment After movie. It started out OK, but then got bogged down and kinda fizzled. Very few, if any, special effects, just didn't seem to have much to say. Not only that, they left everything up in the air, I guess so they HAVE to make part 3! I just hope part 3 will not dissapoint like this one did. I still love Brad, David & Kevin tho......they're always a treat to watch, even in this clunker! They're AWESOME in Six-the Mark Unleashed! (read my review of THAT ONE)Teresa S."
2,I know it's a personal thing but...,"I thought I would try these as I am a boxer brief guy. I know underwear is a personal thing, but these did not ""fit"" the bill for me.They are a lot tighter than one would expect (putting on the XLs was like putting on a Med tighty whitey) - so I was feeling a bit ""confined"" all day when wearing them. The waist band does not hold up well, it folds over. The material is a different feel than standard cotton, soft with a tight weave for lack of a better description. They also seem to ride ""low"", so it felt like I was always needing to pull them up. They seem to handle the wash just fine and hold together well.So given all the above, I could only give them 2 stars. You might like them and rate them higher, but I will be staying with my boxer briefs for now."
1,Terrible Product,I think this product is terrible. The first time I put my 40# golden retriever in it she tore through the mesh liner in 1 hour (the time I was gone) and got out. It is not durable at all!!!I am very disappointed.
4,Chaos Balance (kindle),"Good solid book and if you like L. E. Modesitt's style, you will like this book. Chronologically, it is a follow on from the Fall of Angels."
4,Great for a 3 y/o,"I liked the in depth explanations in this book. If you are starting your child out for the first time and they are 1 or 2 then this book is probably a bit much information wise. However if, like so many of us, you have a 3 y/o who is still struggling with the potty (and I'm sorry if you do!!) then this is a nice book. It talks very frankly about how pee and poop are the byproducts of eating and drinking. This is nice for those of us with children who are freaked out by their poop. My child regressed in potty training right before the new baby was born and needed something beyond the very simplistic beginner potty books and this does nicely."
2,This book is over the head of a two-year-old.,"My 2-year-old has shown an interest in the potty, so I bought this book (among others). It is written in a FAQ fashion, not as a story. It may be useful to parents who don't know what to say when their child asks about poop. However, my son is not going to look at one picture long enough for me to read a 30+ word paragraph to him. I returned this book."
4,Good value,"Ordered this item as new item, but received a ""Used, Good"" item. With that said, it was obviously never used, was in excellent condition, and will serve my needs for translation. The cover is a substantial vinyl."
1,ha!,"If your name is Leilani and you're wondering why the rating for this song is so low, it's because your brother Drexel has rated it 1 star! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
2,Why all the Accolades? This Book is a Bore!,"A ghost story with the (supposed) intention of being more cerebral than those told around the campfire, its result is only a lugubrious tale of self-loathing. This book could have been cut by at least 100 pages and still would have taken too long. Mr. McFarland would have done better to drop the attempt at intellectual symbolism and just get on with the ghosts. More words were wasted on the central character's life-long mistakes than the actual spookiness (ha, ha) at hand. If he really wanted to write a successful story of spirits, he could learn a thing or two from Daphne DuMaurier (REBECCA) or Isabelle Allende (THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS)."
5,Great CD,"I first hear of Fase when I was in Mexico this summer, and when it was finally released in the US, I vowed I would buy it before the year ended. I finally bought it last night and I listened to it, and it was better than I expected. The music is not like anything I had listened to in Spanish (the closest this comes to is Kinky and Plastelina Mosh). The only drawback is that Alma's voice is not great, but she carries the songs well enough that it does not really matter. If you like electronic music, buy this one."
5,Top Notch Comedy,"This DVD is hilarious. Steve Byrne and Dr Ken are the standouts and will have you laughing hysterically. I have already watched the main feature as well as the deleted scenes 6 times and it hasn't been a week since I got it yet. My only complaint is that it's too short, I want more already.Don't think twice, just buy it, you will love it!"
1,When you wish upon a starr.....,"... can a waste of $40 million be all that far! The evidence is in!! And it is not pretty. Under investigation for 6 years ( including the 20 Million dollar Walsh investigation ) Our government has spent 60 Million + investigating a president who brought posterity in peace time, balanced the budget and lowered the welfare roles. And out of it we get this. A tawdry piece of paper concerned with secret tapping and brokered immunities to bring to light a relationship between two consenting adults. Has this country lost it's mind! It is time to cut all of Mr Starr's government credit cards and send him back to the Rutherfurd Institute he slithered from."
1,Garbage!,"This is an absolutely disgusting piece of trash, brought to you by the Puritan, Witch-hunter, Neo-McCarthyist Ken Starr. $40 million for this? The GOP ploy worked.. it drew attention away from Campaign Finance Reform and the Tobacco Bill. Thank God millions more can flow into GOP coffers."
4,dremel blades,"these came really fast. i havent hada chance to use them yet, but isuspect they are going to work very well"
4,An important but neglected subject,"I picked up this book because my uncle lives in Eritrea and I knew next to nothing about the place. It was immediately apparent that the writing was that of a journalist and not a historian but Wrong does a good job of placing the modern problems in a historical context. Some might say that the author is anti-American in her presentation but, if the shoe fits... The subject of Eritrea is important from both a humanitarian and strategic perspective but most Americans couldn't find the place on a map. A recommended read."
1,"The War Report, then this musical massacre...","The War Report was hit and miss - some undeniably brilliant moments flanked by some annoyingly sloppy ones - but this doesn't even get the good bits right. The Reunion is infuriatingly monotnonous in its attempt to strangle the life out of the great swathes of string sections layered over breaks that refuse to do anything out of the ordinary. CNN try too hard with their lyricism that remains typically cliched about street life without shedding new light on anything other than the ghetto (apart from the seemingly obligatory soppy love slop that creeps up unwitingly on Full Steezy. Gone are the great bass-heavy gunshot beats of classics such as Illegal Life and Iraq, instead replaced by tracks without any soul or feeling whatsoever. They say the sophomore is the most difficult album to achieve success with, but I'd be surprised if this amounts to anything. Desperately, desperately disappointing, this is one Reunion that you wish never came about..."
3,Good low-budget horror effort,"This is a stylish, British, ""They check in, but they don't check out"" horror film. It's obvious someone took a look at Paranormal Activity, and the same sort of scares happen here. There's also a good amount of casual sex and nudity involving attractive women, which is always appreciated. Naturally, this kind of fun is soon severely punished. There's a legend of course, and tons of blood, and somebody or something picking people off one by one--but just the mates of the three couples at first. The innkeeper, of the Tony Perkins variety, is a likely suspect. Unfortunately, nobody's very likeable or interesting, so we don't particularly care what happens to the characters, but all in all an enjoyable low-budget effort if you like this sort of thing. Let the ""extras"" roll after the credits--they're entertaining as well."
2,Forbidden,"I was disappointed w/ this book. It didn't pull me in like the previous books from Kerrelyn Sparks. I'm currently on Chapter 14 waiting for something exciting to happen :(At this point, I just want to read it to finish and move on to something else."
5,Great earbuds,"I was having trouble with traditional earbuds because my ears are small, but these things are perfect. Very comfortable and average sound quality that blocks out most ambient noise. For the price you can't get any better."
1,JUNK,"I have tested quite a few earbuds and is the only type of headphones I wear.I figured for the price I would try these as an extra pair.They fit ok, but the Sound, OOOO The Sound, It isn't good at all.My ol trusty Sony earbuds sound 100% Better.I would suggest look elsewere for better earbuds."
1,don't bother!!,"I'm giving these one star, but only because they work as headphones do. Otherwise I'd give no stars at all. The problem with these headphones is that once the memory foam tips wear out (mine lasted no longer than 6 months, maybe less) you have to get new tips, which are only available online through the JVC website. They cost about $3, plus $7 of shipping (yes, that's the cheapest shipping option they give), plus tax. So? It all comes to around $12, which is what a new set of headphones cost buying them through amazon... This makes buying these headphones a really bad investment. Don't bother getting them, they are not worth it. Don't even bother looking at them. Run fast, go away!!!"
2,Disappointing DeWalt tool,"I had the misfortune of having several of my power tools stolen. One of them was my Porter Cable Model 543 jig saw. I replaced it with this DeWalt version. After light use the sole plate was constantly sliding from the 90 degree locked position and anyone who tried to change blades were constantly frustrated and handing me back to tool to change the blade. I recently purchased another Porter Cable Model #543 and I am am as happy with it as I was the first one I owned. The DeWalt is sitting in a closet and I can't think of anyone who I dislike enough to ""give"" this frustrating tool for free!"
1,Saw is Dangerous to Left Hand Users,"I bought this saw, and promptly returned it the day of purchase. I'm left handed, and the blade lock is on the left side of the handle. The button is convex, so everytime I tried the saw the blade would lock in a running position. Funny, but the contractor's model (which is about $30 more) has a concave button which doesn't cause issue. Apparently Dewalt values the fingers of contrators more than do-it-yourselfers. Luckily I wasn't injured, but some South Paw is likely to lose a finger."
2,Zulu & acapella songs great...instrumentals a snorefest!,"When I heard that LBM was doing an album with instrumental backing...I didn't quite know what to think. This fantastic group is world-renowned for the symphony they can create with their voices, so why go instrumental? I do, however, encourage musical exploration...so I figured I'd give it a try.What a mistake this album was! Besides 4 or 5 songs (including ""Yitho Umlilo Ovuthayo,"" ""Sohlabelelu Hosana,"" & ""Jesus Is My Leader"") this album is total bore. Hearing this fantastically talented group do Bob Dylan, Curtis Mayfield, & Billy Joel covers backed by pedestrian instrumental arrangements is extremely disappointing. If you want to explore the magical experience of South African zulu singers, then get another one of their albums...try the Greatest Hits, or just about anything else but this one.I love LBM, but this album is just a disappointment (especially after seeing them in concert!) Spend your money elsewhere!"
2,It does not burn and arrived crushed.,"I have used this brand for several years but this is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon. First of all it arrived crushed and most of the incense was in the package and not on the wood sticks. Although it smells good, the incense would not burn, even when I would relight it. Too bad I do not use it everyday or I would have found out sooner and returned it before the 30 day deadline. Now I'm stuck with useless incense."
5,Great Quantity at a Discount Price,"I often burn these incense but I can't find large quantities locally. This is a great price and if you already purchase these, you know the lovely fragrance. The best thing is these are FRESH. They are not dried out, and the dust that falls from them is a sign they are fresh. Don't bother purchasing dried out incense that don't burn well. I will be returning to this vendor frequently to purchase my incense now!"
5,Great Seller!,"I've ordered from Tom's Incense before and I have to say that I will continue to do business with them as they are great. The incense is precisely as they advertise it, the prices good and the delivery times are impeccable. I ordered my last batch of incense in quite a bit of bulk and they even included a small extra box of incense at no charge! Highly recommended."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"It's not a *bad* book, and it certainly held my attention for several trips to the reading room, but as previously mentioned, the advice mostly boils down to ""watch your back and don't be a jerk."" I did enjoy the writing style, but was irked by its flaws, some minor--spelling expatriate ""expatriot,"" for one--and some major: the authors don't seem to understand the difference between ""automatic"" and ""semi-automatic"" weapons.Educational? Sort of. But certainly entertaining."
1,don't fall for the promotion,"Never has so much space been used to say so little. The book doesn't contain anything anyone with an ounce of common sense doesn't already know. If you are considering buying this book because of a deal being offered, skip it. I bought it because of the deal with the Motley Crue book, and I regret it. Just stick with the Crue book and forget this turkey."
3,"OK, not the best","I teach field biology and bird identification, and my students have used many books, including this one. I prefer other Michigan birds books (Birds of Michiganby Black and Kennedy) or evenA Field Guide to the Birds: A Completely New Guide to All the Birds of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides(R)), which I have always found to be accurate and informative. Beginning birders often think that photos are better, but illustrations are actually much more helpful because they highlight differences and nuances that are critical for identification. I also prefer Birding by Ear for learning songs, rather than the one that accompanies this book."
5,Incredibly easy to use,"My daughter and I stumbled across a copy of this book at our local library. We couldn't get enough of watching the birds at our bird feeder after that to see how many different varieties we could identify. I bought my daughter a copy of the book last Christmas, and we've been able to identify all of the birds that we've seen so far.I like how the book is arranged by color and then by size. The colored pseudo-tabs along the edges of the pages make it very easy to flip to the right color. This morning, it took me less than 10 seconds to identify a female rose-breasted grosbeak. My sister was impressed. I'll"
4,Great bible for travel,"I really like this bible. The leather is nice and soft, and it fits perfectly into my purse. The only downside is that the text is really small. And sometimes it can be hard to find the book you are looking for. But I am getting used to it and I take it with me everywhere."
4,Compact,"It would have been nice if there was more a description of how large ""compact"" was and what exactly ""thinline"" meant. I didn't realize how small the bible was going to be."
5,Great travel Bible,"This Bible works our so well for me, I am very happy I purchased it. It is easy to take anywhere and makes it possible for me to have my Bible wherever I go."
4,The kids love it,"My kids reach for this game first when using the Game Cube. It is easy to play, but has many opportunities to increase ones skill."
5,It will blow you away,This is one of many fans that I have purchased. I am hopeful that it will be my last. What a great fan for the price. And so much less obtrusive than a box fan.
4,Remote control,"I have a ceiling fan in my apartment bedroom, however it just didn't cool like I wanted. When I saw this fan, I knew I had to give it a try. I have used this fan for over a year now and I like it very much. I wanted a box fan with a remote control and this seemed to fit the bill. I start out the night with the fan blowing directly on me and then when I get too cool I use the remote to change to the rotation feature. On warmer nights I often start at medium speed and then switch to low all without having to get out of bed to adjust the fan. The fan seems well put together, with no problems so far. The only thing I wish, is that the fan was somewhat less noisy, but then that's more a subjective quibble. My only hope now is that when it comes time for a replacement, the quality will be the same."
5,My Father-in-Law's Favorite Knife,"These knives are always sharp. My father-in-law, who is a great cook, loves these knives. He uses them to carve the holiday turkey or cut a fresh loaf of French bread and they work beautifully, always. I bought two to replace the Ginsu knives that he lost (I think my sister-in-law kept them when we celebrated a Holiday at her house). A fabulous item at any price!"
2,it was not what I needed I needed 12th edition,The person I purchased form was fast and I had it in no time. the only problem was it did not say what edition it was and I assumed it was the 12th. That is my fault not theirs.
4,"Good details, helps explain things in a clear manner.",Keeps it easily explained without getting to technical but still giving you the techy tidbits without you knowing it. Definatly one of the better books I've read on Flash.
3,"Interesting, but too instructional.","This book is a hands-on guide for Flash 8. The problem is if you want to really learn the program, you should practice creating things, not follow step by step to emulate a bunch of premade exercises. Of course, if you don't use this book you could be missing out also."
5,Great Teaching Book,"I've really enjoyed this book, it's very clear and too the point. Comes with videos where needed, a few more would be nice, but it's really enough. If you go through all the lessons, you will be generating websites in Flash pretty quickly."
2,"Eh, it's ok. Not like the original...","I was just looking for an 8 Ball like I had as a kid. This wasn't it, sorry to say. Oh well. Didn't cost much. Never did play the 'game'. The ball doesn't 'sit back' (the '8"" would be at an angle if it were original) and the float doesn't come up to the window so it is hard to read the 'answer'."
4,much appreciated,Craig Storti has made an important contribution to both people going to work in another culture and those returning to their home culture.
3,The Da Vinci Code,The narrator speaks about a priest and his treasures but was sometimes hard to understand. It keeps going on and on about hidden treasures and secrets. I was not sure want the point was because it wasn't clear from the beginning. I bought another video about the Da Vinci Code and it was a lot clearer from the very beginning.
1,terrible,The product was open when i received it. It was hardened all over the box and there was very little in the actual container. Obviously I was unable to use any of the protein because it had been exposed to unknown substances and probably chemicals. Just a terrible experience i had with this product.
2,Where to begin...?,"The taste is alright, this product will give you cavities. Also half way through the tub and I have seen no gains whatsoever."
2,too much swing,I don't see why people are labeling these guys as a ska band. They are swing. I'm not a fan of swing but this CD is okay I guess
3,Uhhh?,"These guys are weird. We were sitting in church and our youth leader was saying how he was going to a concert to see PFR (I think) and a guy asked who else was going to be there, and our youth leader said the W's and everone started laughing. They aren't that good, and they repeat the same thing over and over in there song ""The Devil is Bad"". Now, I will give them some credit. My 8 year old brother likes them. I'm not trying to be mean, but compair them to MxPx..."
2,BLAH BLAH BLAH!,"I just hate it when people make a group the newest and hottest group and don't realize that this is not quality music. (so swing is popular and their the first Christian band to play swing that is no reason to forget your senses) I was all excited when I got the demo for the W's. Loved the songs. But somewhere between the demo and the finished project the songs became blah! The songs are not musicaly tight and the vocals went downhill. I beleive this W's craze is comprized of the same contempary christian music listerns that like Jaci Valequez, Point of Grace, and Avalon. They think they are living on the edge, moving in the fast lane! I know I just upset half of every Christian under 25, but trust me and go back to your regular section of the music store."
4,"One good song, but not all","The devil is bad is a great song, but after that the songs all start sounding the same. Don't get me wrong, I like them, but I don't like the repetitveness of artists who are new in the business. Supertones can get that way too, I don't mind going to the concert, sometimes the albums get to be boring if I listen to them over and over again."
5,This CD is so awesome,"I must admit. When I first heard the W's, I didn't like them that much. But then I got a CD with ""The Devil Is Bad"" on it, and I dance to it every day (O: This is one of my favorite swing/ska bands now. I definately suggest, that if you appreciate music with stlye, that you get this CD."
5,Trick or Treat soundtrack by Fastway,"This is the 3rd Trick or Treat sountrack that I have owned, I wish it wasn't such a pain in the a** to find eveytime! It's the best soundtrack that I have ever heard. It blows me away!"
4,Awesome,A blast from the past. I loved this movie when I was young and I'm so glad that I found it here on Amazon.....
3,Hard to hold,"I like the look of this squeegee, and the soft double blade does a good job getting water off tile. However, the configuration of the handle and blade make it very hard to squeegee efficiently--it might be fine if you're used to just squeegeeing in one direction, but if you like to sweep quickly back and forth rather than straight down the tile as I do, this squeegee makes it pretty difficult. I also found the handle slippery when wet and too small to hold securely. I'd give it one star, except that it is purty and someone with small hands who doesn't require bidirectional squeegeeing functionality might like it just fine."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected, by the name and the pictures, for this to be a collection of signs, not just one (they get to choose which one at that). But, I can accept that as my fault since, if you do some digging, it does say ""includes one sign"". The thing that got me is that it arrived already broken in one corner and peeling all over the seams. I have contacted the seller and will get back to you on how this is handled.Over all, though the sign (would) be cute, it's not exactly a 'steal', a little pricey for just one sign. I don't exactly regret buying it but, I probably wouldn't buy it again, not will I buy another one."
4,4.5 stars,"Excellent Tracks:T2,T3,T4,T6,T7,T11Very Good Tracks:T8Good Tracks:T9,T10Meh Tracks:T5Bad Tracks:T1Horrible Tracks:Current Single:None"
5,everthing you're gonna want,This album is probably one of Vertical Horizons best yet. The catchy sound and good lyrics make for an awsome mix. I defionetly recomend it as a must.
5,Rockin',"Wow. While its definetly a departure, it is an unvbelievable album. Incredible songs. I can't stop singin' them when I'm liustening, and also when I'm not. I'm buyin one for the car and one for the home deck. Excelent disc."
4,"Worth buying, but not your old VH","This is for the mot part a new, harder, more electric sound for VH. A few songs like ""You're a God"" and ""Shackled"" sound more like stuff from previous albums. Of the rest, they're pretty good, but a few sound cranked out and over-produced (especially the first single, ""We Are""). Kane's ""Shackled"" is the real gem of the album - an extremely well-crafted song. I wish he'd had a stronger presence on this album and Scannel stepped back and spent a little more time on quality than quantity."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE!!!,"This is by far the BEST CD I have ever owned. Normally, I buy a CD because I like a tune or two that I hear on the radio. Well, when I bought this one, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only do I enjoy EVERY track on this CD, but it stays in my car and I just play it over and over and over again. This is a top-notch band! This is a group that everyone can enjoy! What are you waiting for? Get this CD!!"
5,this cd is awesome,this is the most awesome cd ever. before i got it i would flip from different radio stations trying to find the song everything you want. it is an awesome cd
3,Solid Debut,"Here's a band that could still go a long way in the future if this album is anything to go on. Yet this is what was said about the likes of Hootie and the Blowfish after their sensational Cracked Rearview. Yes, there is some exceptional music on the album. There is no doubt that Everything You Want and You're a God are great tunes, as are Send It Up and Shackled, but then they also include Miracle which has the most irritating chorus ever heard. All in all this is a strong album. As usual the test will be to see what they can conjure up next: Can they maintain this standard or improve on it, or is this as good as it gets? This album is well woth a listen, so maybe three and a half stars would be a fairer rating."
2,Hang the DJ,"I don't know. I really don't like this. I don't think this really sounds like REM. I think this is safe, middle of the road stuff that might appeal to fans of Jewel. It's not the worst thing I heard all year though. If you would like a good melodic, mellow band with good songwriting, listen to Belle and Sebastian or The Continental Drifters. Sorry, this doesn't cut it."
5,Great new direction from a great band,"Although quite a departure from their previous three discs, Everything You Want is another great disc from Vertical Horizon. If all you've heard from this disc is the title track, you really need to give the whole album a listen through to get a better feeling for the depth of the band's songwriting ability and overall talent. If you want to go even further, I'd suggest checking out their other discs (Live Stages, Running on Ice, and There and Back Again). Although There and Back Again is my personal favorite, because of it's great acoustic sound, I'd suggest that you pick up Live Stages first."
3,Does not fit 2005 Outback XT,"The distance (center-to-center) between the studs on the Moog is about 4.75 inches. This means it doesn't fit the 2005 Outback XT. I'm guessing the XT might be different than the non-turbo version, but you can check by measuring the stud-to-stud distance. The XT requires a distance of just a touch over 5.25 inches."
4,Thalberg-Last of the Tycoons,"This was the kind of book you want to memorize if you are interested in the early beginnings of MGM.Thalberg started out as a secretary to Carl Lemelle, and his brillance and observance of the film industry was noticed by Lemelle and Iriving was placed at Universal as Producer. He took a company with low revenues, and with poor management and made it into a thriving movie making business.He left there to join forces with Mayer, and they made the deals that subsequently formed MGM.You will learn much about other producers- and how Irving operated and made MGM a multi-million dollar business.The journalism is very accurate. I could hardly put this book down for one who wants to digest the early makings of MGM. I also found the spot online where THalberg had his ""Ocean Front"" home in Santa Monica. Amazing what the internet can tell you.I would recommend this book. Nice B & W pics too.Barb"
3,Expensive and only OK,"I had high hopes for a superior product. It seemed average in it's use, awkward to handle and not as wide as many on the market. The ""sleek styling"" with no handle was maybe aesthetic but certainly was no advantage. For the price, I was more than disappointed."
3,Love it! But...,"I have bought and worn two of these for several months. I LOVE the fit and the way it smooths out lumps and bumps. The bra fits well and looks smooth under all but the clingiest t-shirts. BUT, the back seam on both of them started getting ""runners"" out from the middle and pretty soon developed into tears. It is the same as my bra size, so I think it is the correct size. I also have another same size briefer of another brand that is a year or so old and its seams aren't strained, but I don't like the fit as well."
2,Slimming Firm Control Body Briefer,"Unfortunately, this did not provide the ""firm body control"" I thought it would and after one month the seams split and the whole thing ripped. It was comfortable when wearing and the underwire bra was also comfortable but there was not enough firm control."
2,Fall-a-part Flexees,"Have been buying this brand and style for quite some time, however, the seams do not seem to be properly stitched on some items and pull out in areas that havent any particular stress. Have received replacments from the factory for several items and returned items for examination. If the price wasnt so good I wouldnt buy this brand."
4,National Treasure - Readable and entertaining,"National Treasure is a very readable highly entertaining book. The author weaves and interesting tale of intrigue and conspiracy from medieval Japan to modern times. The commonality is two ancient and valuable swords that move through history, their possession affecting their owners in many ways. A great story by a first time author who really knows his historical facts and writes well."
1,Glad im not the only one.,Didnt play on my 360 HD-DVD player either!!! Is there any way to fix this?
4,A Raw Real Life Adventure,"Superb high definition videography, suberb narration by the eloquently toned British actor Jeremy Irons, make a true life story that is starkly realistic and brutally violent. If you are the squeamish type, this National Geographic Special is not for you. The story is about a rare pride of lions, named the Soros, that are unlike any other lions on the planet. They are about a third larger than ordinary lions and muscularly built to take down their large prey. They take to the water like they were made for it, going after their only prey, the water buffalo. This documentary makes no apologies and can be upsetting to youngsters or the lily livered in its unrestrained delivery. My only complaints are that some of the scenes of the lions killing their prey were redundant and the feature was a little too long."
1,Guess What...Firmware Update DOES NOT HELP!!!,"Unfortunately, I too have a Toshiba HDA2 and just downloaded current firmware upgrade from Toshiba's website through the ethernet port attached to the player. It made no difference other than I can now eject that disc without powering down! Now about the disc; I went to two different ""B_st B_y"" stores that have demo players setup in their showrooms and got the same results. However, one of their combination players (DVD player ""LG"" that plays HD DVD & Blue Ray) played back PERFECTLY!! Looks like it would be a spectacular DVD, too bad I won't be able to watch it! :("
5,Our favourite movie,"This movie is both my wife's and my favourite. It is a pleasant romance, with a touch of adventure, a good dollop of humour, and a subtle commentary on the difference between Americans and Europeans. A must-see for any movie lover.My one regret is that this movie is not available on DVD. If it were, I'd buy it in a minute."
4,I'LL TAKE PARIS,"I had never heard of this movie before I found it on Amazon. It caught my eye since most of the story takes place in Paris. Since I recently had gone to Paris and loved it, I decided to buy the DVD. I found it to be very funny and fast moving. The plot thickens nicely. Some of the scences toward the end were shot at a beautiful chateau outside of Paris. One of the actors in this movie is the famous Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini. This movie is a wonderful escape from every day life!"
5,AMERICAN DREAMER,Hilarious Movie!! Not well known but you will laugh until your sides ache!!! I have watched this movie at least once or twice a year since I found it years ago. My VHS finally died and could not find it in DVD anywhere was so upset. Thanks Amazon for having it. I have showed this movie with all sorts of friends and everyone loves it!!!
5,Great Movie!!,"I absolutely lov'ed this movie! It's very funny and has a good love story. There's action, comedy, and romance-what more could you want? Jobeth Williams and Tom Conte are a great team, they have great chemistry together."
5,American Dreamer,Every woman's daydream come true. Jobeth Williams gets a coma and awakes thinking she is the perfect spy. In this ideal world she goes to Paris and gets thousands of dollars worth of name brand clothing with only the signing of her name (WOW). She fights the bad guys and wins the love of a rich romance writer.
5,One of my favorite 80's films!,"Back when I was a movie theatre manager we had ""sneak previews"" of this show three weekends in a row. I never saw so many positive comment cards! I's one of my favorite films because JoBeth Williams is so convincing as an amnesiac in Paris and Tom Conti (hot as always) is as befuddled as can be. Reminicent of madcap 40's romps."
4,AMERICAN DREAMER,"Loved the movie, got it inexpensively, quickly with no hassle. Easiest way to purchase things you want without having to struggle at the store."
5,this is super helpful!!,I highly recommend that you pick this up if you love your palm pilot. It is super easy to use and you can keep track of anything you want. I use it to keep track of all the good wines I come across and would otherwise forget about. I was bored with my palm pilot until I got this little gem!
5,Definitive,"Great collection of many of Elvis' love songs (or slower songs). Album one is the early Elvis, while Album 2 is the older, Vegas-style Elvis. Together, they offer a good look at these different stages in his muscial career, which offer very disparate styles. And with 50 songs, this pretty much covers all of the ""love"" songs Elvis had, so it's a fairly definitive collection. For that reason, it's a great buy."
3,Audio Quality is only average,"It's nice to hear the ""King"" again, but unfortunately, the quality of the recording is not up to his voice."
1,Very disappointing vocals,"I have purchased many records, cassettes and cd's of Elvis over the years and this has to be the worst that I have heard. I purchased it to replace some 'stretched' cassettes but believe me they sounded better in their bad condition than these CD's. The selection of songs is great, it just sounds like a bad Elvis impersonator, not at all what I had expected. Don't waste your money on this set."
1,Misrepresented Album,"I was utterly disappointed by this album of Elvis. No where in it's description did it indicate that the songs were LIVE. I hate songs taken from concerts for they are not the original ones and they have audience clapping and talking on them which means, to me, that they are not worth listening to. It is the reason i never go to a concert. I prefer my music pure and not adjusted for an audience. I always check to make sure not to buy live albums and this one said nothing about the songs being from concerts but many were, albeit not all. That there were any means those are lost songs for me and I will not listen to them. So i wish to warn others that feel like I do. Beware of this album for it contains laughing, clapping, and his songs are altered from their original cut to placate an audience."
5,Their Best Songs On This Tape!,"This tape contains 3 video clips, and worth the purchase, all three hit the top 40 , 2 of them no. 1! "" Broken Wings"" And "" Kyrie "" i really like these guys, they are awesome!! This tape can be easily transfered to dvd!ENJOY!!"
1,crapola,"While I did like the writing style and method of story telling I must say that the book was weak at best. It isn't about love or rejection as some reviews have suggested - it's about a pitiful man who hates himself. The stories suggest that his gayness is akin to the other character's physical abnormalities. Weaknesses that inevitably lead to ruin and isolation. The characters are not self aware or self actualized but instead weak, ignorant and beyond pity. I was very disappointed and think the book and the positive reviews are a bunch of crap! Lots of typos in the book too (did I make any?) - that's a sign of course of poor editing, but also overall poor quality to me. Don't buy it."
3,English spelling!,"Just so that some of you American reviewers know, those aren't typos - that's English as written by an English writer!"
1,Distressing -- to say the least!,"A friend, another dog lover, gave me this book for my birthday in August. Well, first, if you're a dog lover, you will hate this book -- especially the ending. This is NOT ""Lassie Come Home."" Secondly, while he is a good writer as far as style, use of the language, etc. -- this is one of the most disjointed books I've ever read -- and I don't see a reason for that disjointedness. I kept putting off finishing the book -- and with good reason. This is a very distressing book -- with no real purpose, not even storytelling."
1,Way over-powered,"I thought the extra power would be great when using the dough hooks, since bread dough can be stiff, but it just flings the dough around then draws it up the hooks into a useless ball at the top. I gave it to Good Will."
5,Found a fan in me!,"This up and coming band has a great sound. Strong lyrics and music! Favorites on this CD include Likeness Fades, Crush and Any Other Way (it's all good). Also had the pleasure of seeing this band live this year - they cover well too. Energetic and fresh. As good (or better) than anything on the radio. Keep an eye on these guys from New Hampshire (and check out the website)!"
4,If you arent part of the problem youre part of the solution,Leave your things in the street and run wild.
1,"Dental drills, more like...","I know I'm going to seem like a cranky old fan, bitter Mr. Pollard ventured into a studio rather than hunkered down in his basement. Not true. The production isn't the problem here. It's the songs. I'm not crazy about the current line-up, but they're not the problem. ""Chasing Heather Crazy"" isn't good. None of them are. The songwriting on GBV albums has been progressively slipping since ""Alien Lanes"", and this album points out just how long ago that was. The one real asset the band had was Pollards seemingly endless font of songs. I used to ask myself if they'd ever dry up, an empty concrete statue all that would be left behind. I asked the wrong question. The fountain still flows; the water, however, is undrinkable."
2,Don't waste your time...or money.,"This latest album from GBV is a prime example of what it is to be totally washed up and void of anything important to say. These songs are so mediocre! It's as if some high school kid got together with his buddies and threw some songs together in a half hour. I actually give this album zero stars but, as biased as Amazon is, my review would never get printed. I know my music and all I can say is that this album is 100%, all-american rubbish!"
3,Mediocre album by GBV,"It's sad but true this is the worst guided by voices album I've ever heard, despite good songs like ""Glad Girls""and the excellent ""The Brides have Hit glass"". Some songs are just annoying e.g ""Run wild"" and ""how's my drinking"" . do the Collapse was way better, not to mention real highlights like ""under the bushes ,and alien lanes"" But even the worst GBV album yet is worth buying , there are at least 6 songs on this album , that you don't want to miss, and that's a lot these days."
4,"Out of the Bushes, Chasing the Stars","The critical intelligentsia seems to agree on Isolation Drills being GBV's best since Bee Thousand. While I don't necessarily agree (Mag Earwhig would be my pick) I can see why this record has garnered that kind of praise. But more importantly, it's truly interesting to see how even though there is a certain overlap (""Glad Girls"", ""Chasing Heather Crazy"") everyone seems to list a different set of favorites from the album (I personally enjoy ""Unspirited"" and ""Privately"" very much) --regardless of how they feel about Isolation Drills as a whole. That, my friends, is always a good sign: a measure of the songwriting possessing a little something for everyone, without falling into contrived and trite conventions. Add a sympathetic, complimentary production by Rob Schnapf, and it's indisputable that Isolation Drills succeeds on various levels. (Even the packaging rocks!) In Bob we trust."
4,The Great Return of GBV,"After the minor debacle that was ""Do the Collapse"", Pollard's redeemed himself quite a bit here. Well, it wasn't as if ""Collapse"" was bad, it was just that Ric Ocasek's production smoothed out too many of the band's rough edges and made what was already an uneven batch of songs sound all the more undistinguished.But this time around, it appears that GBV's finally found how to put the right amount of polish and make a ""big studio record"" without going overboard and drowning out the songs. I'd probably say this one's more in line with ""Under the Bushes"" sound and consistency-wise (meaning very good). There seems to be less whimsy this time around and more of a darker and serious undercurrent to the songs that hasn't been there before. It's one of ther more difficult records- but also one of their most rewarding, and definately their best record in years."
1,minature version is waste of money,Be sure when you order this book you are getting the version you wish to purchase. The full size paperback is a gem. The minature edition is a waste of money. Be aware that the postage on the minature edition costs more than buying a second volume of the book on line used!
3,ad was misleading,"this was the miniature addition and unless you read every word on the ad you wouldn't realize that. Granted, the contents are good but you have to have eyes of an eagle to read it.Bonus! It's good for when you are actually doing yoga to reference positions. it fits in the palm of your hand!"
1,Yoga for Dummies,"I must REALLY be a dummy. Too hard to figure out what to do first, except read.I do not recommend it."
1,Anyone Can Get Published,"I thought that this collection was not only short on each story but written like a twelve year old as well. I repeatedly flipped to the back cover where it refered to the author as ""hip"" and then again to the inside flap to his picture where it read that he was born in 1967 because I continually came across passages, lines, expressions that made me feel disgusted at the fact that such crap could be accepted as public-worthy.The author is grammatically inept and weaves stories as a five year old would tell one - to think it up as they go along. Terrible stuff. I cannot believe that this guy gives lectures at a university in Tel Aviv or anywhere else. I graded it a D+."
2,"Neat little book of disjointed, random thoughts","I bought this book because I loved Wrist Cutters, A Love Story. Kneller's Happy Camp did add more depth to the movie after reading it. But the rest of the book? Eh.It was like peeking into someone's head, and seeing random thoughts or stories taken out of context. A lot of the stories ended abruptly and that was that. So in that respect the book is unique, and has a certain style of writing. Some of the stories seemed to pick up out of nowhere with no introduction and then ended just as quickly with no resolution. So the book came across to me as random thoughts someone would write down in a journal."
2,Weak. Weaker. Weakest.,"This could be the lamest ""coming of age"" film I've ever seen. Neither the characters nor their relationships are credible in the slightest. Jesse Eisenberg lacks the charisma to star in a movie like this. I would suggest that the writer/director find a more suitable occupation -- perhaps operating a train. Then all he'd have to worry about is keeping the train on the track and not overshooting the platform at a station. I give this one more than the minimum one star because the actress who plays Lisa P. is indeed a lovely sight to behold dancing. If you don't already have ""The Graduate"" on DVD, that's the coming of age film to own instead of this turkey."
2,Lacks depth and humor,Avoid this film it's not funny and the characters are not likable.I had to force myself to finish this movie.
3,Mismarketed movie...,"Previews and ads for this movie had you thinking it was going to be some funny comedy along the lines of Superbad... no sir.The movie isn't bad per say on it's own merits, but it's not what I expected when I started watching it. If you are in the mood for a ""coming of age"" movie with a few tiny sprinkles of comedy then watch it. I can't say I enjoyed it since I thought I was going to see a funny movie from beginning to end."
5,Great Film! Highly Recommend,"This is one of my favorite coming of age films of all time, and I've seen them all (from the great John Hughes' Breakfast Club to Fast Times At Ridgemont High). Though Adventureland was marketed as a in-your-face comedy, expect more of a character-driven drama written from the heart. Unlike most Hollywood films, it feels very real, and at no time did it seem like these were actors playing a part (Kristen Stewart actually shot this film before being cast in Twilight). Don't expect this to be as ridiculous or as funny as Superbad, though there are some great laughs that make this a very fun and enjoyable movie to watch.I'd highly recommend this film to anyone in high school and college who is trying to find their way and figure life out.P.S. Whether you grew up in the '80s or not, this film's soundtrack is filled with great songs that are timeless! I was so impressed that I got the soundtrack!"
1,This amusement park is not amusing,"Were Adventureland not filmed at Kennywood, our local amusement park, my wife and I would have tuned out after the first half-hour.Imagine a movie set at an amusement park that is neither amusing nor funny. The sort of movie that 3/4 of the way through it you're wondering when the plot will begin. And the climax, such as it is, occurs only because the end credits were ready to roll. The simple story: several teens or twenty-somethings (they seemed to have no problem getting served at bars) still live with their distant / dysfunctional / alcoholic parents while they pass the time between furtive trysts by smoking marijuana. This is the kind of movie where two characters have one or two chaste encounters, and we're supposed to assign some deep bond between them (something the movie is too lazy to provide).Skip this lame ride of a movie and visit Pittsburgh to enjoy Kennywood instead."
3,Has It's Moments,"If you were in high school in 1987 there will be scenes you forget it's a movie and swear you're just back in 1987. Everyone else can probably skip this movie. Bored hot girls at a minimum wage job are looking to momentarily amuse themselves with certain guys, give the finger to others, or both. It captures the ""in and out of love"" roller coaster that was so common in girls of that era. They just happen to find our nerdy hero the least repulsive among a variety of repulsive dudes."
5,Marnie,"You can not go wrong with the Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock- dvd title ""Marnie."" Tippi Hedren (The Birds) plays a good rolewith Sean Connery - you will enjoy the pieces that leave a bit tothe imagination."
1,Embarrassing,"Hitchcock is of course one of the great directors of moviemaking, but Marnie is just embarrassing. Nothing works, the direction is uninspired and mechanical. Tippi Hedren is unbearable. Hitchcock had a crush on her, which explains her participation. The formal old-hat textbook-psychology, that worked so well in Psycho and Vertigo, makes you laugh out loud, when Sean Connery plays mindgames with Marnie. His fascination with the troubled woman is admittedly fascinating. He's a former zoologist, set on taming the shrew, but this kind of strange love is depicted far better in Vertigo. Hitchcock is obviously tired. Instead of throwing bewildered seagulls on his beloved star, he just throws her career down the drain with this one."
5,"Another Side of Connery in ""Marnie""","I've gotta say, this is one of my all time favorite Hitchcock movies. I thought the chemistry between Sean and Tippi was wonderful. I think I liked Sean more in this role than in any of his James Bond films.And he looks beautiful and virile and shows that he has an acting range beyond what the Bond films were demanding of him at the time. I've never quite understood why this film never got the respect that other Hitchcock films got. But, no matter. I still love it."
4,a disturbing movie to someone with PTSD,"I have PTSD. I've locked out large chunks of my childhood. I first saw Marnie when I was 17. It didn't knock my repressions loose, but it certainly stirred them up. I saw it again when I was in my forties, and I was recovering my memories. It knocked my socks off again. This movie would probably play completely differently to someone with a different history from mine. But it really hit it for me, and all those years when I was holding things down, I think it let me know that I was not alone."
3,Strange but Interesting Psycho Drama,"It's not a Hitchcock horror film, but it's suspenseful nonetheless. Sean Connery has no super spy gadgets, but he's dashing as hell (in spite of the strangely executed Scottish/Main Line accent blend). No birds in sight, but Tippi Hedren is a goddess anti-heroine and Diane Baker is her usual ""quirky kid sister"" character (Why didn't she become a bigger star? She certainly was pushed on 60's audiences in a variety of leading/important parts!)What's most interesting about MARNIE isn't the direction or performances, although they are all very good. It's most compelling as a time capsule of 1960's psycho sexual perceptions and the groundbreaking way it presented its still controversial material.Not a great print...here's one awaiting proper restoration."
4,Classic Hitchcock,"I have watched this movie for years when it's been on TV. Sean Connery at his best and Tippi Hedren is outstanding as the ""cool blonde"". Really enjoy Hitchcock movies and this one is a classic."
2,Cute but not very engaging,"This book looked very cute, but it's not a very fun read for me or for my 3 yo. The author tries to pack way too many Irish words and phrases into the story, which gets in the way of the narrative. After reading it once, she never asked for it again. St. Patrick's Day in the Morning, illustrated by Jann Brett, is a much more engaging read."
3,Not as Good as I'd Hoped,"Not bad. Just not that interesting, either. The connecting theme surrounding these four men, and the connection with the title of the movie, could have been stronger. SHOULD have been stronger, in my opinion. The guy with the mole rats was intriguing; the shrubbery artist was endearing; the lion-tamer guy's life was just odd enough to be vaguely interesting. It's too bad the robot scientist was so enamored of this era's Tolemaic blunder of macro-evolution though. Darwinism is on the fast track to Geo-Centric Universeville. Today's ""science"" is the laughing stock of tomorrow, after all.Everytime the robot guy went on about the staggering complexities of designed robots, and then would gloss over the complexities of designed life as ""the stuff of life"" or some other such meaningless phrase, I was again reminded of the old term ""educated fool."" Too bad. The guy really was brilliant--within the narrow field of robotics. He just needs to stay out of philosophy."
3,A mixed bag,"""Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman,"" is the latest collection of short stories from Haruki Murakami. Personally I am more of a fan of Murakami's novels then his short-story work - his tendency to drift in and out of realism to surrealism works great within the large canvas of a novel but when placed in the confines of a short-story, sometimes the end result seems half baked and begs for further exploration that surely would've been taken within his novel works. That being said, about half of the stories in this collection are firmly planted in reality while the other half veer toward the abstract. One story of interest is, ""Tony Takitani,"" which was adapted into a motion picture by Jun Ichikawa in 2005."
5,Uneven but great nevertheless,"This collection of short stories contains some of Murakami's best work. That there are stories from his past that were probably best left interred hardly mars the genius of this collection. A few stories, like ""Poor Aunt"", are laced with absurdity lacking profundity, like the silliness of a Japanese cartoon character. Yet I have to admire the author's audacity and admit that some of the charm of Murakami comes from the cultural disconnect between Western and Eastern sensibility.What I don't want to read is Murakami mouthing words that could be more authentically articulated by Western authors. In this book Murakami remains true."
3,Not Cynster enough!,"I was thrilled to see a Stephanie Laurens book I had not read because I have much enjoyed her many novels including the dynamic Cynster series. However, I must confess to being a little disappointed in these two stories. The protagonists were charming (the heroes, in particular, showed that wonderful Laurens oooh-factor) but neither came up to the standard she has set in her recent books. The sensuality we have come to expect was missing and although the stories were well-written, the spark wasn't there. I can't wait for another Cynster story - Stephanie Laurens has a rare gift to be able to create fantasy men who meet just about every woman's notion of the perfect seducer! More Cynsters, please Stephanie? This was a nice book, but you've spoiled your fans and we want passion not poise!!"
4,So close but misses being perfect by mere inches.,"This is an incredible book. The illustrations are wonderful. Not just one of every species, but in some case several subspecies as well. It covers all the salmon, trout and char. It even tackles the grayling and the whitefish.What really bugs me is that it could have been one hundred percent. But it misses just one fish. Just one damned fish.The book leaves out one fish. The Sheefish or the Inconnu of the Artic. Stenodus leucichthys. While not a fish many people are going to get a chance to fish for, it's still a salmonnid and a pretty good game fish to boot. It's known as the freshwater tarpon. It living proof you don't have to leave North America to fish for an exotic.[...][...][...]Oh well, better luck next time. We can always hope for a second edition that addresses this short coming."
5,"salmon, trout bible","When our top salmonid scientist teams with our best fish artist .. we get Trout & Salmon of N.A!The other reviews cover the waterfront.This book is first rate.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
5,Hits the spot,"I know a lot of online reviews accuse this band of not being terribly original, but the fact is that this album is refreshing.This record clocks in at 40 minutes, the perfect length for an album if you ask me. It doesn't drag on and there's no song that's weak enough to tempt you to hit the ""skip"" button on your cd player.The obvious comparison to the Melvins has been done and I disagree with most of the other bands people compare to Big Business. I'll chip in on this one and say that Big Business reminds me of godheadsilo minus the robotic facade.Great band, great album....really refreshing listen."
2,Big BS,"I am trying to remember the last time I was this disappointed. I bought this CD w/o ever hearing BB which was a Big mistake. I did so because I heard they were like the Melvins and even part of the Melvins now. I read up on BB including all the 5 Star reviews here. While they DO have a Melvins feel to them there's absolutely no rhythm, rhyme, or reasoning in this album. The biker bar vocals in particular are completely unbearable. If you want calculated chaos stick with the Melvins. I recommend listening to it first before you buy."
2,LOW END PRINT,"While this was an inexpensive version of an old poster print subject, it did not impress me. I did not pay much for it , however, it is no special subject even in the poster line.It has clear lines and smudges from poor copying and scanning tools. It is hazy and darkened. Being primarily blue, once you stand back 15' it doesnt matter, it blends in but the picture has detail that is lost and it becomes only a blue blend on a wall. The colors which should be in it just do not show up properly. I would suggest a different print such as wheat fields rather than the beach of Sainte Adresse. It would be a very nice one if the printing process had been cleaned up."
3,The interactive movie game.,It was very common back then to make cd games that were really just big interactive movies. This is really no different and really not as fun as most of 'em out there at the time. Interactive movie games tend to not give the player full control however most give you some decisions to make but this game really isn't one of those kind of games. If you want to play a good Power Rangers game get the one for Genesis or the two for the game gear. I say this Sega CD Power Rangers game really isn't worth it.
2,Pretentious,"The book is filled with pretentious paintings of an artist trying to be so much more than he is. The fact that he typically paints even the simplist theme in gigantic size points out his overriding hubrus.Bo Bartlett has technique..there is no argument there, but he simply has nothing to say...so he says it as loud as possible so no one will notice the lack of content."
4,Helped me to better understand my mother's family stories,"My grandfather was a miner in Shamokin, and lived the hard lives described in this book. This book describes the hardships of the miners occupation, but also brings the neighborhoods of that time ""alive"". Particularly interesting was the description of the children and their place in the town and their early introduction to the mines. By reading this book, I was better able to understand my mother's family stories about my grandfather, and explain this bit of American history to my daughter when we visited Shamokin, PA."
5,"Fashion,Fantasy & Tons of History to BOOT!","I'm mad for Colin McDowell who must be the patron saint of fashion information professionals! This book has got it all, great photos, shoe sketches, acurate history and even shoe fantasy. I love to use this book to show our students that mules are not a twentieth century invention by Candies. Please take heed this is not a weekend reader for it contains quite a bit of text but, it is great to refer to for research and for those of us who can't get enough information about shoes. If you are interested in shoe design please check out the Ferragamo section; pure candy for the eyes."
1,disapointed,"If you had a pic of the item that would be alot better. I will NOT buy anything I can`t see a pic of. So, you may want to think about that."
2,Not Rosey's best.,"The silly Disney tunes Mitch Miller made her sing ruin this otherwise wonderfuil recording. Buy ""The Essential Rosemary Clooney."" You will never regret that!"
3,Beginner? More like Intermediate,"I'm a beginner, and although I could play some of the songs in this book, it's definitely not that ""easy."" I would say intermediate is more like it. Although the songs are simplified compared to their originals, a quick glance of the book shows quite a shocking view to me (a beginner).Of the songs I could play, it was quite exciting and fun. The collection is definitely something to have for a long time in your music library whether it's truly easy or not."
1,go with what ya know is right,"That seems to be what the derailers have forgotten on this album or maybe they are just being led by nashville establishment to a path more pop.I love the derailers really i do. Got turned onto them in Richmond VA and saw them in San Francisco. One of my favorite groups. this album unfortunately was a true let down I listened to it twice through and could not listen to it again.Talented they are. Great voices, great licks. Just do what you know is right....real country."
1,101 Nutrition Tips for People with Diabetes,Found this book to be very basic. This book would only serve someone who had not read and did not know anything about diabetes. It would be good for a teen. Did not feel it was worth the money I paid.
5,Page Turner,"This is a page-turner written with style. Initially, I was attracted by the period spy plot set in 1941 pre-war society Newport. However, equally engrossing are the portraits of racing boats (and the craftsmen who create them) and pre-war ethnic Connecticut village life. Normally a speed reader, I slowed down to savor the details. The picture of ""society"" reminded me of The Remains of the Day, except that Florence's boat races and chase scenes are more exciting."
5,Nobody better than Dylan,"A great way to go beyond the typical ""Greatest Hits"" collection. This 3-disc set offers Outtakes, Live recordings and Unreleased tracks, mixed with some of the best known Dylan songs of all time. In the past few years many of the Unrealeased and Live tracks have become available but this is still a nice and slick way to go beyond the casual/novice Dylan fan in a very easily accesable package. Of course there is no substitute for owning the full LP releases if you really want to enjoy the artistry of Bob Dylan. If you want to get a snapshot of the music this is a good place to start."
2,Should Have Beed Great - Poor Execution,"I thought this would be a wonderful box set but instead was very disappointed. The major problem here is the sequencing of the songs. This would be a much better collection if it was in chronological order. As it is, it is a very tough listen. Also the choice of songs is very WRONG! The unreleased rare stuff is uneven and certainly not as good as what is on Bootleg Vol. 1-3. The live version of Isis is AWFUL!!"
5,PUMPKIN SOUP- A CHILDREN'S CLASSIC,"What a lovely book. My friend's little girl,who is 3, just loves this book. Her mum raves that she can't go to sleep without hearing it. They gave it to my 2 year old as a birthday gift. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is charming. It's fastly becoming my child's favorite book. It must be...I read it to him at least 3 times a day. Enjoy! I'm going to buy more of her books."
2,Soupy Story,"As a third grade teacher, I thought the story was as thin as the soup. It is extremely predictable with no real hook for readers. I can envision primary grades using it to discuss sharing and taking turns. However, I think there are more entertaining books for conveying that message."
3,Gold Toe Socks,"I've used the Gold Toe product line for a number of years and usually really like it. However, it seems that changes in manufacturers has changed the quality of this product. Overall, the fit is fine and I hope they wear as well as in the past. But what I don't like about them is the seam across the toes....it's too thick and rubs my toes. In the past, this seam was woven into the 'told toe' portion of the sock and didn't cause any blisters due to rubbing. Gold Toe socks for men don't have such a large seam, but is woven into the 'gold toe'."
5,comfort and quality,These are well made and comfortable socks. They fit perfectly and stay put as well as offer a good feel inside a shoe. I would highly recommend them and will purchase more for myself when needed.
3,Game show ...fun?..,"The Unicorn Club are all excited to take part in the BestFriends gameshow,in which they will answer questions about eachother,but when they fail miserably,they may never forgive eachother."
5,A Wonderful Story!,Rosamunde Pilcher's book comes alive as seen through the eyes of a young girl growing up on the Cornish coast in the days leading up to World War II.I highly recommend it.
1,Don't expect the book!,"If I had never read ""Coming Home"" I could have liked this film. It is, however, just not at all an adequate adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher's excellent novel. The soul has been cut out of the story in order to make it fit tidily into a film. The acting and such are fine, as they go, but watching this is like watching a ghost of Pilcher's fine story, and it truly does not satisfy at all. Perhaps Pilcher's books really don't lend themselves to film adaptations. I found the adaptation of ""The Shell Seekers"" to be an appalling desecration of that book too. They should try to make them into a mini-series."
2,Cheap,This table was extremely disappointing. One of the holes to screw in the legs did not line up with the leg. The fasteners for the bottom shelf broke with minimal pressure applied to the shelf while attempting to line it up (the holes on the legs and the fasteners mounted on the shelf did not line up well at all). The color had a very yellow tint to it for a supposedly white table. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the look is surprisingly nice for the price of the table.
4,Ingenious twist on Arthurian legend,"This is one of the more inventive Arthurian novels I have read. It is set in an Arthurian world with certain anachronistic qualities, specifically the presence of journalists and newspapers, and everything that goes along with them, such as cameras. It is centered around the quest for the Holy Grail and raises some intriguing questions. Worth reading if you can find it."
3,"good story, annoying voice","I thought a humor book would have an edge as a book on CD, but the cadence of the author's voice is off-putting. It's like listening to Jackie Mason Lite. Good stories about the behind-the-scenes life of a comedy writer if you can get past the voice of Phil Rosenthal."
3,Curvaceous Concrete Castles!,"I would have given this book 4 stars except that it is written in more than one language which makes the book a bit harder to follow. But there are lots of nice photos of Lautner's homes, except for 2 of them which look like they where done with a cheap digital camera and printed on a xerox machine! I cannot complain about the price though."
5,Must have cd,"this is a great cd ! Some of the best pop rock i have heard in a long time.An incredibly talented bunch of guys. Brandin Lea has an amazing voice, it will give you chills! They also put on a fantastic show . If you have a chance ,definately see them live."
1,Where have you gone Flickerstick?,"Key problem: Overproduction. What kind of drugs did Sony/Epic get Flickerstick hooked on? Whatever pill, powder, or juice it was, I don't ever wanna try it. In the song ""Coke"" they changed the chorus from ""Lie here NAKED with my girl."" to ""Lie here TAKEN with my girl."" What? (...) A band can have a radio hit titled ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" but a reference to nudity is over the line. (...) Buy the indy release of Astronauts if you can still find it. Infintely superior, a near classic. This overproduced version, however, is nothing short of a catastrophe."
2,Not as pictured- be careful before ordering,"These mats are not custom fit, rather they are ""semi-custom"" fit mats. They will sort of, kind of, fit, and are not worth the money when you could purchase mats directly from your dealership that will fit for about the same price.That said, Weathertech mats are very well made. The rubber is high quality and they catch most of the liquid during the winter."
4,good buy does as is claimed leaves dog fully groomed!,"good value, and she loves bieng groomed with it! strong sturdy construction, and very easy to clean, ergonomically designed with ease of use in mind! All pet lover's should have one! Very fast delivery! *****"
5,"Bye, bye furminator!","This tool is well made, sturdy and works! What more could you ask for? It is also fraction of the cost of a furminator. This works every bit as well with less pulling on my dog's coat when brushing him."
4,works,"this product work well. our chow chow was having problems with other products, this one worked well, no pulling at all."
3,Rake,It's OK -- my Shiba Inu has an undercoat so I start with this rake and then go over with a slicker --
2,Unimpressed,"As for construction, it seems sturdy enough and it's unique in that it has rotating teeth. However, it does make a bit of noise which my dog did not like. Also, my dog has a medium coat- not very long, but he does have some undercoat. It seemed to me this would be better for a dog with longer hair or a thicker undercoat- it just didn't really grip the hair or get it out on my dog. Now it's just sitting in a box not being used. I much prefer the Oster undercoat rake for my dog's coat- really gets a ton more hair out than this one."
2,Candice,"Could be better. The rake is quite loud and doesn't remove much of my husky's undercoat. A combination of a furminator and slicker bush works a lot better for me. Comfortable handle and enjoyable for the dog. Doesn't get stuck like many other rakes due to the rotating teeth, but they are quite loud."
4,Nice basic tool but you should polish it first,"I bought this to use on my older Keeshond female. First I gave it the scratch test and found that it had rough edges that would hurt the dog's skin and tear its coat, so I used a piece of steel wool on the tips so that they would be smoooth and safe to use. The rotating pins make a rattling noise as they rotate, so it isn't too quiet to use, but I think it's a lot less stressful on the dog than the bladed matt cutters because this rake doesn't pull the skin nearly so much. Overall this rake was easier on the dog and me because it gets much more hair for much less effort than a regular rake or coarse comb. I'm glad I got it."
3,loses stretch pretty early on,"loses stretch pretty early on--if you have thick or even average thickness, then you might want something else with more elastic in it"
4,Nasty Revelations,"Actually, the only thing I liked about this book is that it is filled with nasty revelations that you might never have been aware of just from watching the show. It turns out that this so-called ""friendliest cast ever"" had many axes to grind. For example, almost everyone in the house disliked Jamie enormously-- and Danny and Kelley hated him most of all. Melissa and Kelley had a greater rivalry than we saw onscreen. And it goes on and on.This book will seem refreshing to viewers who thought that RW-New Orleans was too upbeat."
4,Good buy,"I liked this Real world book a lot in fact I like most of them, all except Seattle which was incredibly boring . But this book gives you a lot of insight into what the camera didn't show. Some of the things mentioned don't seem to make sense b/c when you see the reunions on tv they don't act towards each other they way that you would think w/some of the comments that they have made about each other in this book. Besides that it is well worth your money and time to read it."
5,Ralph's best cd so far!!,"Ralph Stanley has outdone himself on this CD. Not sure how he picked the songs, but he picked some good ones! The songs are fresh, the musicians are absolutely fantastic, and best of all, Ralph's voice is still as clear and beautiful as ever! I have listened to this CD about a million times and plan on listening a million more"
3,tray is frustrating,"My 3 kids LOVE Shrinky Dinks. We have created hundreds over the years. That's why, when I saw this machine, I thought it would be a great gift for them. They do love it, but I don't. After coloring, warming up the machine and shrinking the dinks the drawer would not open. We finally figured out that the tray was stuck and had tipped over. Ugg. I had to shake the machine, poke the machine and almost loose a finer to get the tray unstuck. This has happend repeatedly. I now have a fast and finger free way of getting the tray unstuck. It is a lot of fun for a rainy day. It is fool proof - but that darn tray!"
5,Remarkable!,"I like the Beatles a lot, as well as a lot of late 50s/early 60s music... so here you go! Two great things together!Although I would recommend the first set of the anthology as well as this to the hard core Beatles fans, they cover similar time periods in Beatle history, I recommend this one first, if anything for its fun value (and the lads sound like they are having a lot of fun!). There are nice alternate versions of early Beatles originals, true, but the real gems are the covers, something music fans often don't find themselves saying. Seriously, take a listen and try this one out for a beautiful look at pre-1966 Beatles."
4,Great Revenge Story,"I don't like rape scenes, but I like to see abused people get their revenge. It's interesting to see what the girl transforms into in order to go through with her actions."
2,WASTED MY MONEY!,"My title says it all! This movie has no plot. It's the standard rape and girl gets even with the men creatively. It was very disappointing in its presentation and dialogue. The official review, along with the illustration, is not accurately protrayed. It's guaranteed to put one asleep if they have probems sleeping."
3,Revenge was good...,"**Spoilers. Ok, as a Woman I thought it was an overall well made Film. That being said Rape Scene lasted WAYYYY TOO long. My Husband was about to the point of forwarding but it ended. The Revenge was Cool and WAYYYY justified. Unrealistic how she lived out there for an entire month!??! Come on! 100% better than the original."
4,WOW..,"This movie is strong, violent and not for the faint of heart. I had seen and liked the old one, but had a feeling the remake would wimp out as far as how graphic it would be. It did not that's for sure. It's more graphic as far as the violence, and while they have less of the rape scenes, they are more effective. I watched this with my girlfriend and her face was hidden for most of it. Powerful movie."
3,I spit on your grave,"Do not be fooled, this movie is very intense and will elicit strong emotions from its viewers. If you enjoy a good revenge flick this may be for you. If you cannot handle a very graphic rape scene I would stay away.As for the movie in general, I'll give it credit. It really makes you pull for the girl who is harmed. You not only see her change mentally but physically as well. The antagonists are drawn up well and the acting is pretty good, especially from the protagonist. I never saw the original, so I can not compare the two. I will say from reading other comments that this one is a bit more believable--- probably (aside from the sheriff's randomness of trying to plug people with his own shotgun from his squad car, can you say forensics?). Not a bad movie though, the girl is pretty damn righteous."
2,Bored through out it.,"Watch the original. Not necessarily better by defenition, but this made me nearly fall asleep, then play video games later. At least I played some TF2 while attempting to watch this."
1,A very sick movie,"Like ""Hostel"" and ""Hostel 2"", this is a very sick movie. I haven't seen the 1978 original and I won't see it. The rape scenes and the characters are well done, and therefore disgusting. They make you wish the worst for the rapers, but their deaths under horrible and unspeakable tortures are even more disgusting. The level of graphical violence is frankly excessive, and I regret having seen some scenes. The movie should have been rated, as it is definitively NOT recommendable to a young audience."
3,Phillips Monster Vent Brush,"This is a great brush but it's huge and a bit heavy. Works very well but a little too big and unwieldy. I ended up buying a smaller 2 1/2 inch diameter brush to use instead. If you have long curly hair that you want to dry straight then this brush is for you. Otherwise, it's just a little too big and heavy to use all the time."
4,This book rocked!,"I read Dannahs book a few days ago. I really loved it. As i watch girls in my class dress like hookers all the time, i see how horrible it is that they give away their body like that. I am a 14 year old girl, so I know what its like, and i think ""Secret keeper"" did a pretty good job of addressing the situation. This book, gives a new look at modesty and the deeper issues. I love how they used examples of christian rocks singers, because those women have to be up front about how they want to dress and follow God, and may young girls look up to them. I wish all my friends could own this book, but for now I will just have to let them borrow my copy.An also recommended read from me would be ""and the bride wore white"" by Dannah Gresh."
4,Guys thankful for this book,"Thank goodness there is someone out there writing books like this. We guys who are struggling with lust have a really hard time because we are surrounded by immodestly dressed girls. They need to know the effect they have on all men.I only gave it four stars because I feel the author needed to make plain just what it is that guys are doing when they ""check out"" girls. As they say in ""Every Young Man's Battle"", guys are engaged in visual foreplay with the girls they are lusting after. They get aroused while looking and then bring up the memory of you later when they masturbate. It is not Dannah's style to write so bluntly, but girls need to know the truth about how they are being used when they dress revealingly."
5,The battle is over,"I have battled with my weight for 30 years. I heard about this book over the radio and decided to buy it since all the proceeds go to charity and it sounded like a good read besides helping me with my wieght loss. It was an easy book to read, fast and to the point. I started to do the program, I didn't loose weight right away but I felt a lot better, less bloated, the second or third week is when I noticed the weight coming off. I kept refering to the book for instructions and receipes. I have lost 6 lbs in 3 weeks. I don't really crave the sweets and that is what the author said would happen. I hope to loose 20 more lbs. I recommend reading this book, it will help you eat healthy."
5,Great Plan,"This Plan, Let's Do Lunch has been the best blessing we could have received. My husband Jim and I started eating healthy May 6. We have each lost 20 lbs. We are in our late 60's early 70's. We just got ""married"" last October and decided we wanted to take better care of ourselves so we could enjoy each other for as long as possible. Our energy level has increased and we are acting like teenagers again. Well maybe not quite, but close! Having a help mate to eat with makes a lot of difference. My husband is an excellent cook and has been adapting his favorite recipes to fit this new eating lifestyle. We are also having fun finding new recipes. We enjoy reading all of the on line support. We have been sharing this idea with friends and have passed out a few extra books. God Bless Roger Troy Wilson for his idea. Let' Do Lunch!!!"
3,Choices,"This motivational book has all kinds of helpful hints and suggestions. The author has lived as a 425 pound man and has managed to lose weight and keep it off. His story is touching and comparable to many American's in this seriously obese society.His eat until you are full regime makes sense - no one wants to be hungry after a meal. We won't stick with a diet that denies us. So author Roger Troy Wilson listens to what God is saying to him and he learns how to live and eat his way to a healthier life.This book is just good reading all around. I found myself laughing, crying and comparing my life and those of the people around me to his stories. Sugar is addictive and changing our grab it and go lifestyle is a hard thing to do. But choosing sweet fruits instead of pies, cakes and other sweets soon became a thing of the past. This book gives choices for people to look at and desire in a healthier way."
2,Another false claim,"As do most dieters, I continue hoping for a miracle cure, but there isn't one--including Let's Do Lunch. There are always restrictions so don't let the title fool you."
5,AMAZING,I had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman. He has a great support group online. His profits go to charity. Just a great book that shares how he did it. I lost 40 pounds and have keeped it off for a year. Great guy. great book.
4,Let's Do Lunch.......,"Overall, not a bad dieting book. Its a mix between Atkins (the no breads, rice, etc part) and a fruit veggie diet. I combined it with an Herbalife diet and so far I've lost 5 pounds over the first 6 days. There are a great deal of good ideas in this book with some really good recipes, but if you have issues with eating a lot of fruits, stay away, otherwise try it out. The only issue I really had was how the author said it wasn't a fruit diet, but it is in some ways. May want to rent from library if you are really unsure."
3,Let's do lunch,The book came in fine shape but it took 3 wks. My friend ordered this book on ebay and got it in 3 days.
3,Doing Lunch,"I recently read the book ""Let's Do Lunch."" The basic premise is that a person's main meal of the day should be lunch, and it should include protein. For breakfast and dinner, the author suggests fruit. He apparently lost a significant amount of weight and has kept it off by following this eating plan. I can see where eating your main meal in the middle of the day would be a good one, but only eating protein at one meal is the opposite of what so many other diets propose, which is to eat several mini meals throughout the day,including protein in each one. This approach seems sensible and easier to follow, which of course increases the chance of success. I'm just sayin."
4,Great Reading,The book is an easy read. It tells how he lost the weight and what worked for him. There are sample menus to get you started and they seem to be very do-able.
4,Book,"As advertised, delivered on time and just what I wanted. Couldn't ask for more everyone should have one. Must read time and time again."
2,"Ok, let me get this straight, Jane is thrown into a time","machine by her drunken boss and years later when he shows up, she and he have sex and then marry each other? If I were Jane, I would have a nice big screaming fight with him too.As for kids? forget it.It is nice thought, that David can tolerate Jane's perception without shutting her out emotionally and he doesnt attempt to take over her life and expect her to live happily ever after with him just because he feels his perception and interpetation is right and she should not argue or question it."
4,Brutal to the Max,"So, I guess you like grindcore and all that jazz that six weeks records does. This stuff is pretty good. You can preview it on the listen now tabs. Check out the bands' myspace pages for more demo to preview. It would be a better by if it was cheaper, but that can be the price you pay for buying it new."
1,Extremely disappointed.,"Unbelievable. Two of the four legs were so bent that it couldn't even stand up straight. The bottom half of one of the lion's faces was broken off and laying in the box. And if that weren't enough, the bowls were NOT 2 quarts. I paid $54.99 for model #665 which is supposed to include two 2-quart bowls. The packing slip said #665 but the bowls are 1 quart bowls. Don't these people know how to measure? It doesn't even deserve one star."
2,didn't work very long,"This collar worked for my lab initially, so I actually ordered a second one for my much smaller corgi. The strap is very adjustable so it fit both dogs fine. Soon after I received my 2nd collar, the first one pretty much stopped working. It would make a click like it was going to spray but then wouldn't. This problem was solved on a few occasions by shaking the device, but within another week or so it was totally toast. The 2nd collar lasted about the same amount of time, 2 weeks. It worked great on my dogs when, well, it worked...but that was not very long. I would not spend money on this product again."
4,Anti-Bark Spray Collar--Citronella,"The collar works quite well. Now I only have to put it on my dog, and not even turn it on, as she knows what it is all about! Makes walking outdoors, much more quiet, now! Only one problem has surfaced....if another dog comes up to us, barking, my dog gets sprayed, even if she is not the one barking! That is why I am happy I can now leave it turned off for her!"
4,Still hoping,"Have had the Innotek anti barking collar for almost 3 weeks now. At first we had no problems,but last week I started to find that the tank was empty when I came back in from shopping.Not sure if there is a problem with the collar or if my dog (English Springer Spaniel) has worked out how to avoid the spray.Tried it again today and once again all seemed ok.So am keeping my fingers crossed.If this stops working then the neighbours will have to put up with his occassional barking as I have spent over 150 on various deterents including another kind of collar the smell (Pheretone) type,which also worked for a few weeks then dog got used to it."
2,Pomeranian Puppy - Does not Work,"I have a Pomeranian puppy who barks up a storm over anything and everything. The collar was really big, but easily solved by cutting off the excess and the product was very easy to use. Unfortunately, once I put it on my dog, he barked once and was sprayed with citronella, but he was not scared at all. He was more curious and continued to bark just to be sprayed. It was quite entertaining but did not serve its purpose."
3,"Good Idea, Good Correction, Not Long Lasting.","The idea behind the citronella collar is wonderful, and it controlled my dog's barking well....until the cartridge ran out. Unfortunately, I only got about 6-8 hours of barking control before the citronella cartridge ran out and my dog felt free to bark all she wanted. This was usually when I was sleeping. So great idea...just a bigger cartridge and longer lasting product would be desired!"
2,Works at first,Bought this for our barking newfoundland - worked right away - then after the second day she got immune to it and would bark until it emptied which did not take long. You cannot return it and the replacement spray is a little pricey and hard to find.
1,Didn't work for a small cocker spaniel,Our dog barked every night in his crate and early every morning to let us know he wanted out. We tried the ultrasonic products with no luck. We tried the citronella spay collar but it only made him bark more. At last we tried the static shock collar and after one bark the problem was solved. We and the dog now sleep through the night. Save your money and go straight to the static shock.
1,Disappointed....random spray with some noise or no noise :(,"Would never buy this again....it randomly sprayed citronella with or without any sound initiation and the spray did nothing to deter our Aussie Blue Heeler from barking. The spray unit is also a bit bulky and our dog is slender...uncertain if this would be appropriate for any small dog. You also have to ensure that their fur is not obstructing the spray unit in any way or it will not work appropriately. Our dog has medium shag hair length around her neck, so this provided yet another obstacle when applying her collar. Ugh...too much work and no reward."
4,Electric fence doesn't work,The collar worked well to stop the barking but confused our dog with the electric fence collar. Now we have a bark free beagle who is an escape artist.
1,"I would give this product a ""0 stars"" if that were an option!","I just wasted $40! I filled the collar, turned it on, fastened on my dog...my dog BARKED and BARKED and BARKED and BARKED and...you get the picture. This product did NOTHING to hinder my dog from barking! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!"
1,Not for stubborn dogs,"I have a feisty havanese (9lbs) who loves to watch TV with us. Having a 73""Hi def tv she thinks everything is real. We can no longer watch westerns (hates horses) or war films (soldiers)or Kung-Fu panda (really). We almost had to sedate her to get thru War Horse. Got this product and it worked for about a month. Now she looks like she is having an epileptic seizure jerking her head back every time she barks and gets sprayed. This no longer works on her. Time to try a stronger method. Tried a sonic collar previously with similar poor results. Take 3 - UGH. At least the house smells pleasant from the citronella!"
2,Pretty Good,"The collar works well when it sits correctly on the dog. Unfortunately, it has a habit of flipping over so the citronella sprays down instead of toward the dog's nose. If it stayed put, I would give it 5 stars!"
5,Not a sound when on,"I purchased this on amazon for my cocker spaniel who now does not bark when this collar is on. When I remove collar he will bark. I am impressed with collar function and size. Overall,very happy with results."
2,Too good to be true,I bought the spray bark collar to help control my German Sheppard's loud annoying the neighbors bark. It started off great she'd bark it would spray & she'd stop. Then in a few days of wearing it she started to like the spray. Now it's just another addtion to the junk drawer...
3,"It works, but, it works to well.","The transaction went smoothly. Delivery was quick. Product is incredibly effective. The only draw back is that the sensor is TO SENSITIVE and there is no way to adjust that. If my dog yawned, it set the sensor off and she was sprayed. All barking issues stopped immediately which was wonderful, however, I couldn't watch her be tormented all day if she burped or exhaled a deep breath."
4,Curbed my dog's barking but has design issues,"Got this for my doodle who is not an incessant barker but still reacts at the slightest noise from outside. A few observations about this spray collar: 1) The strap slips easily when assembled according to instructions. I experimented until the strap stayed put. 2) The sensor is too sensitive and activated when my dog just growled softly or when my upstairs neighbors walked on their hardwood floor. I put masking tape over the sensor, so now it only activates with a full bark. 3) Take care if you have an easily scared dog, like mine. It seriously stressed him out the first few times he was sprayed, and it took some doing to settle him down. I had him wear the collar for brief periods under supervision until he got used to it. But ultimately, it seems to have worked. A week later, he rarely barks and stops after the first bark. Will update if the situation changes."
5,Primary Sources Explain,Nothing is quite as satisfying as reading an actual document and understanding what it means. It allows you to feel the motives and intentions of the author. This collection of documents is excellent!
2,Overly Priced,"""lakeplacegames immediately addressed my concerns. HOWEVER, thought I was purchasing 10 packs of Neon Disks for $28.99, but that price was for only 10 individual disks. The picture in the ad is very misleading and the item is definitely OVER priced. I would recommend that you read carefully and do research, there are other places on Amazon that sell these same disks for a lot less."""
3,which guitar is it,i would love to buy the guitar pictured but MH 50NT is not the name of that guitar. but the model number is right. so im confused.
2,Avoid - these are re-recordings!!!,"The songs on both CDs are re-recordings, and the artists sound nothing like they did when they released the song. Example: When David Houston sings ""Almost Persuaded,"" his voice is out of sync with the music and does not have the emotion it did in the original recording. If you want to buy classic country compilations, the Time-Life Classic Country series is always a good choice. I also recommend Universal Music's ""Pure Country Classics: The #1 Hits,"" if you're looking for a great single-disc of classic country. As far as double-CD packages go, you cannot beat Hip-O's ""Classic Country Gold"" or Sony's ""Country: The American Tradition."""
1,Amazon.com ought to be ashamed of itself for selling this,"The original Ktel records in the 70's were popular for one reason,they presented the original songs and original artists,I dont know where these came from but there all redone and you can tell this right off the bat,It just does not make sense for what they paid the artists to redo the songs they could have percured the rights to the original songs.I think it has something to do with transferring the album to cd and no rights were given,but it still is not fair that Amazon does not put a warning up there that these are not the originals...????"
5,A great book as well as a series,"I have read the whole 3 part mini-series 4 times, I just can't get enough! I think it is the best book series of all. Jessica persuades Elizabeth to be an au pair in France this summer. Liz is reluctant at first and then gives in. This is deffinately a must read!"
3,Past its 'sell-by' date,"Originally published as ""The Psychology of Everyday Things' in 1988, this book looks at the nexus of function and form from theoretical and practical points of view. While there is much to recommended it, and the principle are solid,the book is hopelessly out-of-date in its examples of everyday design, particularly computers and telephones. While Norman writes in a folksy, sometimes humorous style, DOET still reads like an undergraduate text book, and is highly repetitive. I'd look for something more contemporary."
5,A must read for programmers and engineers alike!,"Norman does an excellent job of showing the reader that interface design is not simple a matter of putting a handle or some buttons on something. His in depth analysis of not only which interfaces are good or bad but why is an interesting and educational read for anyone who must create objects, devices, or interfaces that a person will interact with. The language is easy to understand and not heavily technical but still remains interesting. His examples are not specific to computer interfaces but to many different kinds of devices - telephones, light switches, etc. An excellent book for readers of any level - student or teacher, from junior high on up."
2,good rule of thumb information,"While in University, studying Industrial Design, I would have rated it a 4 .... now I rate it a 2. It is still the rarest example of litterature on human perception affecting design. It still is unique, but you will not need to read it more than once, it is likely not to become a reference in your bookshelf BUT it is exellent for university/college level reading and book report to anyone studying psychology and or design. The book is full of anecdotes and lessons. It would be best if accompanied with a good textbook on perception. Reading some Papanek in conjunction with a perception textbook and this book will result in some well intentioned Design creativity I'm sure."
3,"I am glad to have read it, even though the reading was dull.","This is actually a really bizarre book, in that it is as much an autobiography of Dr Norman's experiences in his own home as it is about design. Dr Norman is like the Charlotte Bronte of engineering -- although appaerently trapped in his own little world, he manages to discover universal truths that are relevant way beyond it.Don't be confused: this is a rather tiresome book to read, as Dr Norman evaluates the design and usability of taps, light-switches, telephones and door handles (lots of door handles), but in a cosmic sense, worthwhile.In short: I am glad to have read it, even though the reading was pretty dull."
2,"Good concept, but out of date","Twelve years ago, this would have been a fascinating read. I managed to finish it, but I was distracted frequently by out-of-date material. This book needs to be updated. I would love to read the author's current thoughts on these topics."
5,Very informative,"I have owned and restored GTO's before they became popular. Having heard all the 'other' hype from magazines and having read 'Glory Days', I have always felt there was another side of the story. This book answers a lot of those questions, and makes a lot of sense. A great read, I could not put it down. The first reviewer must have some kind of personal vendetta against either the writter or the subject of the book, or maybe both to slander the book such in his review! A must read for any 60's musclecar enthusiast!"
2,Will the Real Mr. Royal Pontiac Stand Up,"I have read Milt's book as coauthored by Mr. MacDonald from cover to cover and I must say I was impressed. I have met both Milt and Jim Wangers at car shows in the past. Mr. Wangers gives the impression that he was the inventor of the GTO and all the Royal Pontiac ideas were his alone. The real Pontiac afficionadoes know the truth. The book was awesome and really caught the spirit of the Great GTO. I read a review by some guy know as the Car Geek and I must say he certainly wasn't reading the same book I did. The old pictures which I had never seen before were great. As an owner of a 66 GTO, I must say this book clearly chronicals the complete and honest story of Royal Pontiac and its additions to the greatest car ever built."
3,Package is deceiving,"The board books themselves are great - nice and chubby, cute illustrations and just a few words on each ""page"" so as to keep up with rapid turning from the baby. But the box it came in is so flimsy it will not hold up for very long. I would consider the box as gift wrapping not a permanent storage place for the books."
2,H & G crafts projects,"This book is more on the order of ""how to make a lampshade out of pipecleaners"" than it is a guide to the serious art of oriental bamboo construction and design. Thirty seconds after I received this book in the mail I was back at my computer to print out a return authorization from those wonderful people at Amazon. Perhaps an elementry school teacher or someone with way too much time on their hands and not a lot of purpose can use a couple of the ""projects"" but to those of us looking for a guide to making an elaborate deer scare or hand tying a traditional fence, this book is not it."
2,tycoon games,Some of the games will not work on my PC can not get them to load correctly. The other games are so so. Do not think I would rcommed this.
3,"Jury's still out on durability, but the packaging really stank.",I bought these knives as a gift and the box came all torn and scratched up. I'll update this review when I have more feedback about handling and cutting but so far I've been quite disappointed with my out of box experience.
2,Disappointing,I found this book to be a difficult read--and even more difficult to finish. There are parts that stick out as great tales of Winston Chuchill. But overall there are simply too many details. Unless you are student of British politics there are probably better books to read on this historical figure.
2,Abridgement or butchery?,"I realized it was an abridgement of the book, but I had no idea it was such a drastic one. Much of the text was truncated to the point of being clumsy in transition. In fact there were times when the cuts were so dramatic that one was left with some ambiguous antecedents. It was well read, but there just wasn't enough text remaining."
4,"political, not historical, biography","Think Robert Kosowsky's review is pretty much on the mark.Historical events are not presented except in relation to timing and political positioning by Churchill and others. For example, if you don't know about the Dardenelles operation of WW1, this book will not help you. Despite the final line of the book, this is not uncritical of Churchill and at times makes him appear to be motivated by politics as much as anything else (the author was a MP and in the Cabinet so was a political animal too). This does not ring entirely false as it makes it easier to understand his switching of political parties. And this makes it a good counter to Churchill's own books which are at times clearly self-serving."
2,Not the best Stephanie Plum Novel,"I really like the series and enjoy Stephanie's typical little mishaps - but this one just didn't ""feel right"". As some reviewers have already remarked, the love triangle gets boring and her ditzy-ness in this installment really is more annoying then funny... I hope book 11 will return to its former class and charm.It is still a decent read, especially if you are a Stephanie Plum fan - but it's far from the charm and quality of the first few books in the series."
3,Not the Best - But worth reading.,"I enjoyed reading most of the story. I did find that it dragged at times. The ending seemed rather abrupt. I agree that it is time for Stephanie to make a decision and the books to move beyond the relationship issue. Joe is the obvious choice. Make the decision and let Stephanie deal with juggling married life , kids and her job. The love triangle theme does not have to continue for theh stories to continue."
5,Great Book,"As usual this is one you can't put down. Ms Evanovich is a master about bounty hunters. They should make her books into a TV series, like Spencer books."
1,Didn't finish and will not read anymore,"I have been reading the Plum series since they first came out and Janet Evanovich wasn't very well-known. Unfortunately, I have not liked the last 2 books at all and didn't finish either of them. The series is getting down right silly and there are too many other great authors to read."
2,"Stephanie Plum has ""jumped the shark""","I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum series but this one was a real diappointment. Nothing happened! It was as if Janet took pieces out of each of her other nine books and condensed it into one short novel. I got to the point where I found Stephanie, and everyone else, annoying. Either there needs to be some movement in the characters or retire Stephanie and start a new series."
3,What happened to the ending?,"Just this past fall I was turned-on to the Plum series by my neighbor. I've just completed the run with this one. Ten Big Ones was better than book Nine. The laugh-out-loud bits had returned, so through most of the book I was happily satisfied. But after the ending, I felt jipped! The ending was, to me, just silly. And once our heroine was saved (again), that was it! No wrap-up. No teasing of things to come with Stephanie's romances. Very disappointing! And, please, Ranger (one of my favorite characters) is turning into a comic book character. His one word dialogue (that being ""Babe"") is getting very boring. I'm hoping for better things in Eleven!"
2,The anticipation was better than the read,"I have been anxiously waiting to read this book since I learned of the release date. Hmmm.... it's just not funny to me anymore. The lines are old and the humor is just mundane. I didn't see any attraction between Stephanie and Joe or Stephanie and Ranger. This is the 10th installment and Stephanie still hasn't gotten the bounty hunter thing right? May be it's time for a new job. Or may be it's time for a new twist in the story. Something needs to happen to bring this series back to life. In the meantime, I'll just settle for reading the 11th book when it comes to paperback; if I'll read it at all. I'm starting to wonder if I'm reading more out of obligation instead of pleasure. May be the change for me is to start looking for another series to read."
3,"Go, Stephanie!","The plot is pretty thin and it's not the best of the series, but the delightful characters and laugh-out-loud humor are what keep me coming back. It's astounding that Stephanie gets away with what she does, but I think Ranger says best the reason I so enjoy these books ""this is a high-stress business, and you're comedy relief....."" These are stressful times in which we live and I, for one, can certainly use comedy relief."
3,The threat this time was much too real,"I am a mystery lover. That said, I read Janet Evanovich's books (ALL of them, I generally LOVE her work) not for the mystery or thrill but for the humor. But in this book, the threat to Stephanie was far too realistic. Being on the hitlist of a gang's serial killer? That's really terrifying! I spent the whole book thinking that she was acting like a total doofus, going about her usual business and just ""being careful,"" whatever that meant. I for one much prefer it when she is being hunted by goofy guys whose threat is more funny that fearsome."
2,More annoying than amusing,"The first Stephanie Plum novels were fun, laugh-out-loud affairs; they provided a good escape without requiring much effort. Unfortunately what was once amusing has become annoying in many cases. The series is becoming stale - too formulaic. The escapades get more and more ridiculous. The requisite car demolition is no longer interesting. The back-and-forth between Joe and Ranger is forced. Her love life is silly. Perhaps she needs a new love interest - she isn't able to really commit to either Joe or Ranger. Some of the peripheral characters are still amusing, and sometimes I still laugh. But overall, Ten Big Ones was a big disappointment."
4,Another Great Installment,"I ran out and bought this in hardback. I just couldn't wait. As usual, I loved it. Evonovich simply has such a wonderful voice. Her characters are REAL, and funny at the same time. My only quibble (the reason this didn't get 5 stars) is that the story didn?t seem to be done when the book ended. It ends with a bang, and I wanted another chapter to unwind in. I needed to sit with Stephanie and Morelli on the couch, and get drooled on by Bob a bit. I needed to drop another wildly inappropriate food into the hamster cage. I needed a little down time."
2,"Same-old, Same-old","This book shows signs that it was rushed to meet a deadline; hence, the lack of development. Good serial books, regardless of genre, have either a plot that develops the storyline or a plot that is new; this book has neither. After reading the book, which took about an hour, I realized that this was a ""filler"" book, which included recycling parts from her previous books. Stephanie Plum, at the end of the book, is pretty much in the same place she was in at the beginning of the series. Perhaps Ms. Evanovich is frightened to mess with the formula?"
3,very disappointed,"I love the Stephanie Plum books. Usually I can't stop laughing or put the books down. I am afraid that this book did not hold my attention. The ending seemed hurried and left me waiting for the real last chapter.Ranger, as always, was facinating. This time I found myself frustrated with Stephanie -- as if she needs to grow up and make some real decisions about what she wants from life.I am eagerly awaiting the next book."
3,10 Big Ones,Good read. Stephanie is beginning to be a little repetitive though. Her one liners were fewer than usual but the story line kept my interest. Joe was out of sight mostly this time. She letting Ranger be the main squeeze now?
3,Total Lunacy - That's Stefanie Plum,"If you are a fan of the ""Stefanie Plum"" series, this book is a must read. While this book is not as funny as previous novels - it is entertaining. A fast read with a few giggles. This bounty hunter series is ""comedy"" - NOT suspense. It is Stefanie's typical bounty hunter lunacy. Why are all these readers suddenly taking Stefanie Plum seriously????Yes, the potoato chip felon is dumb. Books One through Nine also had much dumb, not realistic, tales. Remember when she fell out of the tree in the backyard of the mob? And all the funeral home stories?come on everyone..........lighten up.Again, it isn't the best of the series but it will keep you entertained for a few hours.If you are new to this serious...don't start with this one. Hot Six...possibly the funniest....will make you laugh laugh laugh."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"Ferguson makes so many mistakes... how does anyone take this fast talking swindler seriously? He pretends to be a modern day Kenneth Clarke but his grasp of history and his unfounded conclusions are totally bunk. I cannot even begin to counter all the mistakes he makes. How the hell did Harvard get taken in by this crap??? He actually uses the word egalitarian incorrectly!!! He incorrectly links WESTERN Rock N Roll to sex rather than rebellion against authority. He totally misses that the root of the word PROTESTant is protest. Way better, more entertaining and informative: James Burke's Connections, better David Starkey's Monarchy, and best of all Kenneth Clarke's Civilization. Ferguson is a cultural light weight with a $500 hairdoo."
4,A nice book.,I thought this was a nice book. The story was different and the story moves along very well. The two characters are very likable.This is a good read.
1,looks like its not just me...,"Well i hooked it all up and it seemed to work somewhat perfectly for the first 6 movies or so...now...it will not play any of my dvd's. they freeze at every chapter, and the only way to resume the movie is to stop and play again. there's no luck in watching a dvd at a certain point, because it does nothing but freeze when i try to skip a chapter...ive tried totally disconnecting it and reconnecting...ive about had it with this thing. it plays CD's fine, but...i wasn't looking for a new CD player...what can i say. you get what you pay for...and thats what i get for being cheap."
1,Piece of ... - dont waste your time,I had to return 2 units because they refused to play DVDs properly -- lots of stuttering and pausing in DVDs like Romeo+Juliet. Spend a bit more and get something better.
1,So far no good,"Out of the box I had problems. No matter what discs I tried, DVD or CD, all I got was NO DISC on the display. From other reviews it would seem that this isn't uncommon, hopefully my replacement works. I am giving this 1 star only because they won't let me give it no stars."
1,Should be no stars,How aggravating...If you like freeze frame all the timeon 75% of all DVDs then this is the product for you.I wanted a simple..functional DVD player. My Ps2 worksbetter. I'm going to try to send mine in.
1,Review Scam?,"Check out the other reviews on this book, and then check out all the reviews by that person. See the pattern? All of the reviewers have either only reviewed this one book or 2 books by Mr. Root. How credible are these reviews?"
4,"enjoyable story with a believable, symathetic character","This was a great new take on an adventure story, where Lou Martini's character goes on a very personal journey to overcome his demons and fight against his addiction. it is a timely topic and a well executed movie. The acting was good and it looked like Lou Martini actually went through the weight loss himself in making this movie."
4,Very Good and Unique Movie,I really like this movie. Quite a unique plot and very good acting and dedication to the roles. Give it a watch ans give it a chance if you aren't sure about it the first part. If definitely picks up and gets quite interesting.
5,Lelli Kelly toddler shoe,Adorable shoe. Liked them so much after they came I ordered another pair in a different color. They were on sale so a great bargain otherwise I might not have purchased them. Very cute and well made shoe. Runs pretty true to size.
1,Wheels fall off,If you want to drag fifteen gallons of oil in a metal pan this is the tool for you. I would not buy another.
2,"Yet Another ""Basic Instinct"" Rip-Off","""Color of Night"" belongs in the same category as ""Body of Evidence,"" ""Night Eyes,"" ""A Passion to Kill"" and the many other films inspired by the success of ""Basic Instinct."" This ""psychological thriller"" revolves around a sexy seductress and possible killer and tons of nudity. It seems everyone connected with Dr. Bill Cappa (Bruce Willis) keeps dying in strange ways that are never fully explained. The killer is likely from a group of crazies that Willis presides over but we never really connect with any of them. Willis, looking buffed and not shy about baring it all, is miscast. His laughable dialogue includes lines like ""People are dying around here and you act like its Disneyland!"" Jane March is beautiful but can't act - but Lesley Anne Warren and Brad Dourif, who can act, are stunted by a terrible script. No value beyond some campy dialogue."
2,Scene stealing,"There are two reasons to watch this movie (and i'm not talking about Jane March's er.. assets). Ruben Blades and Brad Dourif's performances are so far above anything else in the movie that its like somebody else wrote their parts.Blades in his scenes with Willis is so much better ( i know it's Bruce Willis, but acting is like #4 on Blades' CV)he almost rescues the entire movie, and at least gives the story some gounding.Can't recommend this as anything but a guilty pleasure (those Jane March assets again), but keep your eyes on Blades too and you won't be disappointed."
3,It's a guilty pleasure not a great film,"I watched this film originally because of Jane March, who I think is a real cutie. (Full disclosure: my wife thinks she looks like a chipmunk but she likes Bruce Willis so she tolerates this film.) It's all I expected: lots of Ms. March, wearing very little when she wears anything at all, and smiling a lot; Bruce Willis ('nuff said), and some really lame ""suspense"" plot that does little more than provide excuses for more nudity and sexual antics. Do you care? Well, it's no Pulp Fiction! Depends what you want to see, and at least it's a lot easier on the eyes than some of her other turkeys (Provocateur, Tarzan).Honestly, if you're looking for a film with a story, go elsewhere -- even March's first hit, ""The Lover"" -- is a good alternative. If you're looking for some guilty pleasure, look no further. Fast-forward through the non-nude scenes and you'll be watching this one over and over. It's a guilty pleasure, but sometimes you just gotta give in."
5,Color of Night,"The quality of the recording is excellent. The colors and clarity are suberb. Was on on cable the other day. My recording is much clearer and sharper and brighter.I purchased this from amazon. Like everything that I have purchased from Amazon, it came quickly and in perfect condition, as well as easy to open."
3,Funny Sci-fi psychological thriller,"The movie is entertaining and thrilling at times. This is not the best of Bruce Willis performances, however, it seems that for the producers and film makers it was more important to explore on Bruce Willis erotism than on a great plot they had in hands, if addressed from the psychological perspective. The plot reinforces the concept of how arrogant and insensitive a sychologist can become, especially if he, unprofessionally, gets sexually involved with the pacients he treats. This is the most laughable part of the movie, by the way! I personally think that Scott Bakula could have performed a better role as Dr. Capa. It is puzzling how hollywood producers discard some good actors with no reason at all...Unfortunatelly, Bruce Willis is just a nice face to see as his acting is poor in dramas. He certainlly does a lot better in action movies when there is a little talking."
4,"Effective, but needs a little tweaking....","Dreamweaver is a deceptively simple-appearing program, but is incredibly powerful and complex ""under the hood"". Thus, future users will need exceptionally well-prepared materials to learn it well.This book is an excellent start, with numerous tutorials and videos, but the reader will definitely need additional materials.Lynda.com is quite well resepected for its tutorials, and rightly so, though I personally find them rather dry (in comparison with the Total Training series). Author Daniel Short, while undeniably a talented, skilled and capable instructor, has a voice that could be bottled and sold as a prescription-strength sedative.The book is an ideal supplement to the Lynda.com series, and could even be considered critical to adequately grasping Dreamweaver, but the section on CSS falls seriously short in conveying understanding to the neophyte.I do recommend this book (even highly), but hope that Mr. Short and Lynda.com can address these shortcomings."
5,"Latest Software, Best Advice","Perfect for beginners, each step is explained thoroughly with many illustrations to assist the reader. Tremendous amount of information, easy for reader to move from beginner to highly proficient in Dreamweaver 8 program using this book."
5,DVD comedy,"I am a HUGE fan of Jeff Foxworth. And, this DVD delivers if you enjoythis type of comedian. Have watched it many times.The DVD arrived in pristine shape and promptly. Would buy/recommend the seller."
4,Dafa wedge from amazon,I love the shoes- I already have a pair I ordered from another sight in a different colorMy only complaint is that the shoes I received from Shoeflake through Amazon looked a bit like they were worn or a bit from the inside.Otherwise the shoes are nice and comfortable.
2,Disappointed!,I was very disappointed when I put these shoes on! I literally have gone through 6 other pairs and bought these since the ones I have Are worn out. I immediately threw away the boxes since I know my size and love the shoe.The next day at work I slip them on and they're wayyyyy too small. Seems like a full size smaller than marked. I even tried stretching them but to no avail.What a waste of $80+ on shoes I can't wear or return!!
5,One of my little girls favorites,"This is a must-have for baby's library. Very rhythmic in terms of tempo and rhyming, so even if your baby is too young to understand the words, they will enjoy the rhythm. And when they are older, they will enjoy the story. It's a very sweet book about all sorts of things that are fun to do, loud things, messy things, etc, but sometimes babies just like to curl up with a parent where they feel safe and secure. Aww... :-)"
3,Whats a duck leg press or scott pulley curl???????,"I bought this book so I could set up myself a workout program. I read the book then went back to check out the suggested workouts. Then I got a big let down. I didnt have a clue of some of the exercises that was listed. Very very few exercises were explained on what they were and how to do them properly. I've bought other books even to try and find details on workouts, the only one i've found so far was golds gym encyclpedia of bodybuilding. If anyone has any info on a book with alot of exercises and there discriptions let me know. If charles would have thought of us intermediate guys this book would be a five star book-- six stars if i would have taken the pictures for the book. They suck real bad."
3,A good book,"The price is outrageous. You can find this book at a normal price somewhere else, if you search.Mr.Poliquin brings many new and old ideas back in the forefront.He introduced the bodybuilding world - back at the Muscle Media 2000 days - some very essential laws of strength training. The writings are a copy of his Muscle Media articles. Some ideas (like German Volume Training, DropSets) are brilliant and some other suck (tempo variation, swiss ball).The presentation in the book is what you might expect from a monthly magazine: poor, brief and compact. Good read for most trainers out there, many new ideas to explore for other strength coaches but nothing else.This book cannot transform you in a elite physique or in a new infamous strength guru, if you will not devote extreme personal amounts of time & effort.."
4,One of the best,This book helped to make me a better bodybuilder. Only the lack of an index prevents me from giving it five stars.
2,Too small,"I knew it was going to be small, but I can't believe how small it really is! My 2 1/2 year old grand daughter doesn't have any interest in it. Maybe when the weather gets better & she can play with it outside, it will be better."
4,hiphopheadsreview,"ever since he dropped his classic debut in 94 people have been sayin that warren g has fallen off. im hear to tell you that's not true. take a look over my shoulder his muchly underapreaciated sopmore album released under defjam soled very poorly. two years later he's back with i want it all. this cd is awesome. laid back beats that will make your head bob up and down all night. every song is tight. i must say this is not really a warren g album it's more of a compolation album. the guests are impresive, snoop,nate,rbx,kurupt,crucial conflict,eve, and many others. also check out his newest cd return of the regulator."
4,"A FRESH, FEMININE SCENT","What first catches your eye is the bottle - it's a stunner. Wide and then tapered it is topped by an imaginative ruby tone shape - a pout, a kiss, a heart? All of these signify romance, which is most definitely appropriate for this subtly sensuous fragrance.Princess Marcella Borghese launched this scent in 1993 and like all classics it has withstood the test of time. Its floral fragrance is as fresh today as it was when introduced. A very feminine scent it has additional notes of fruit - plum, peach, plus musk and cedarwood.I never tire of Il Bacio - summer, winter, springtime or fall.- Gail Cooke"
1,gyrenegeorge,"A solid, vintage WWII film about Marines in the pacific, with a large, star-studded cast in both major and supporting roles, and largely accurate attention to detail in uniforms, weapons, and equipment."
1,It's not suppose to be a book about DSSOCK!!!,"Why would I need a book to show me how to work with a shareware control by a vendor???? Would I be better off by just purchase the product which comes with full documentation and supports. I was very disappointed when I realized that Franklins just went off on Dolphin System OCX. It would be much more useful if the author talk about Winsock (which was IGNORED!!) and other built-in components. Off the record, Franklins has no sense of humor...although he tried very hard. My advice, find a real internet programming book. Cheers..."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book some months ago expecting an increase in understanding programming TCP/IP protocols used across the Internet. I hoped to get a better understanding of Winsock programming. I did not.The book is acceptable, I suppose, if you are content doing VB development strictly using the Winsock Active X controls. I would have preferred that Franklin focus more on the out-of-box control than the DSS (a vendor) Winsock control. I was particularly annoyed that some of the examples just would not work with the out-of-box control.I did get a little from the book. However, I've read better, and, not to repeat myself, it was not what I was expecting."
1,The title lies!,"Carl Franklin has significant credentials and I expected to see a full description of WebClasses and other VB6-specific features in this book. What's there instead is a sloppy update of his VB4 book and poor to non-existent coverage of the power new features VB6 provides. Carl has gone the way of other authors who make minor changes to existing content with each new VB release. Because VB6 adds so much to internet programming that wasn't there before, this approach borders on being dishonest. Shame on you, Carl!"
3,A Good Book,This is a easy entrance book for graduated students. Chemical Engineers will be safe with this.
2,Baffling,"Those who have gone through several koans might be able to make some sense of this. For the average student it will be meaningless. It sure was to me. I found Zen mind, beginner's mind by Suzuki far more helpful."
4,Rockport mules,The shoe was very nice and well made but...I always wear a size 6 but this shoe was a little too small for my foot.Sent it back
4,"Supersize my litterbag, please","I actually bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. As soon as she opened it up, she instantly knew that it was one of those ""you bought this for me, but really for you"" type of gifts! Convenience and cleanliness top my list of ""things that make me happy"" so this was an easy buy. It's well made and I love that drinks can be poured into it without worrying about spills. It also does not clog up floor or seat space.All of those perks make for an ideal trash bag on a road trip EXCEPT that it's just too darn small. So if you've got even one child and plan on being on the road for several hours without a pit stop, the garbage can pile up pretty quickly. Otherwise, it's great."
3,"I like it, but shoddily assembled.","I had a little higher quality expectations for this item, but it is what it is and will get the job done. The stitching around the seams is not great. There were many loose threads hanging off of mine. I took a lighter and burned them down. In addition, the buckle on the strap was placed on in reverse which would cause the strap to twist around the head rest. I had to cut the strap, flip the buckle, and burn the strap's edges to prevent it from fraying. After a little work on my own part, I was happy enough to put this in my car, but the quality could be better. It is ultimately just a trash bag though...Im not sure how much I could have really expected."
1,Disappointed,We were very unhappy with this product. It is flimsy and keeps collapsing into itself. I purchased it for my husbands new car as he has a very long commute daily. He finds it frustrating because it won't stay open or keep its shape.
2,Sucks,"Pros:- Waterproof- Look like the product in the pictureCons:- Feels very cheap- Looks crappy- Lid thingy doesn't close properly, so don't except to put anything smelly in there- Cheap hinge for lid"
2,The Man Who Wrote A Dodgy Memoir,"I read this book a few years ago. I remember being quite disappointed with the book and look at it as a bit of a joke. Allan Williams had the opportunity to write a really fascinating memoir, but he blew it! I would've liked a bit more about the demented behaviour of Lennon before he was famous. Some of the 'conversations' Williams remembers seem the work of fiction. One thing the book did well though, was to set the scene. Certainly not a must-read."
3,misleading,The picture is misleading it was 5 random packs of the set without being in the card board with the plastic windows like the picture shows. But over all it wasn't bad.
3,Lively but Cautious,"After having read Arundel, which was supremely excellent, followed by Rabble in Arms, which was not as great but still very good, Lively Lady had a difficult time measuring up. The story seemed too fantastical, and at times unbelievable for being historical fiction. The ""luck"" of the main character was a bit too much. While Roberts writing remains excellent, I wasn't a fan of this story; it seemed forced.Captain Caution, on the other hand, did grab my attention and held it. I liked the story line and the characters. It seemed Roberts wasn't trying so hard in this story, and simply wrote in his usual excellent manner.While Roberts tried to tie both Lively and Caution to the Arundel characters and stories, these books can be read, and enjoyed, independent of Arundel and Rabble. If you are looking for well written literature, Kenneth Roberts is one to read."
2,Not the best,This book was extremely slow. At times it was alright but there are much better books out there about the Holocaust and World War II
4,Wonderful feel for a place and time that no longer exists,"I have the feeling that any translation of this book is bound to be disppointing. I have read it in the original and it speaks to me of a place and time I once knew but that no longer exists. My family suffered during the spanish civil war and they never wanted to talk about it. I feel the same pain here when the author just touches on what happened here and there. I'm well familiar with the streets Rodoreda describes. I have walked them many times and they feel right to me. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be transported to another time and place. By the way, the translation of ""coloms"" into doves is a bit poetic. The real translation is ""pigeons"". Barcelona is infested with them.... Happy reading."
4,The Bird Lady,"Time of the Doves tells the story of a young woman who marries the wrong man and ends up dealing with a life of poverty, naughty children... and birds. Eventually things change, but her life is definitely not one to envy.Good Stuff- It is at times humorous and a bit random, but in a charming (not annoying) way. Like when the toddler throws the intestinal word the family was storing in a jar on the baby.- The story flows well, weaving through the pivotal moments of the narrator's life.- It was different as far as setting and time period for me, which I appreciated.But- It really felt that at times the translation was off; this really bothered me the most. Some of the words just felt... wrong. And, hence, the flow of the syntax seemed off at times.- For me the end was a bit contrived and a little too happy for my liking.All in all an interesting, enjoyable quick read."
4,Must Read,"Great Novel, interesting stories and awesome use of literal language. This is a must read novel, of classical spanish literature."
5,El Mejor Libro Del Mundo,"Este es el libro que todos deberian tener y que todos deben leer. Y para colmo es gratis, asi que no hay excusa. :)"
3,Think I am going to like this,"I did not finish the book yet, I was so glad to find a free copy, that I thought I better go ahead and get it while I could. I read a little of it and think I am going to like it when I have time to finish it. Thank you for the free book."
2,Very disappointing.,"The book falls short of delivering the promise of ""The Secrets of Creative Collaboration"". There are a number of current examples of groups which have achieved varying levels of greatness either within their areas of expertise or impacting the region or country they support, including within the military which the authors discounted. The book is poorly connected, disjointed to this reader. To include the clinton campaign and Carville at the expense of better examples only enforced the perception throughout most of the book that to lead a great group, one must (usually) be an insensitive bully, willing to inflict whatever degrading words or actions which spring to mind to move the group forward. There are far too many other books available to the novice as well as experienced manager which describe traits and actions of group leaders and group dynamics."
3,"A Worthwhile Read, But Dull in Some Spots","Warren Bennis and his colleagues narrate a series of ""great group"" case studies including Disney, the Manhattan Project, and Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. The premise behind the book is that great groups share certain characteristics in common that could be replicated to produce other great groups. The book is very well-written, but I started to get bored in the latter chapters. The case studies just weren't that compelling. Overall, I thought the book was a worthwhile read. I would recommend it to someone interested in putting together a creative team or to anyone who is generally interested in teamwork."
4,More Diabetic cooking in 30 minutes or less,Good or very good for diabetic cook books. We've tried many and this one is much better than the average.
3,have an old motherboard and need backup peace build a server,"I use a athlon xp on an old soyo motherboard with sata 150 to host windows home server- works like a charm, cost close to zero depending on the amount of castoff computer parts you have floating around your place or your mates. now I am at peace even if my main drive on my pc crashes as I can recover all including the install os drive from the home server backup.and it is running on an athlon xp"
2,d20 Future Cyberscape,"This book has a lot of great new cybernetic stuff in it (new classes, a gadget system for cybernetic attachments, new hardware,etc.), but it creates a system that doesn't mesh well with the original d20 Future chapter on cybernetics. I like my rules cut-and-dried and ready to go, but this supplement isn't readily compatable with the original d20 Future rules. If you want cybernetics to play a major role in your world you will definitely want to buy this supplement, but be prepared to make some decisions."
2,Broken Wet Stained,"When I first got this book, I was in the middle of a move and I stored it away with the rest of the items. Now a few years later I was able to get a look at this book. I found missing and torn pages in the end section and water damage. It looks as if someone had dropped it on a wet floor and walked over it, smearing ink and tearing pages."
3,Hard to believe,"I listened to the book on CD, read by Nick Sullivan. I tried to read the book at first, but got caught up in the simple writing style. It was more enjoyable to hear the well-developed characters ""speak"" and have life. At times, I found my heart thumping and getting carried away in the story. But as the book progressed, I found the plot to be extremely unbelievable. Hamilton's descriptions of the U.P. of Michigan were accurate and allowed me to reminisce of the time I lived there. However, I couldn't imagine such a wild story ever taking place in Paradise. I was disappointed with the ending.As for the reader, Sullivan, he made the book come alive. I thought that the voices he chose to represent each character were perfect. He did a good job with the U.P. accent. It was a little off, but still made me laugh."
3,A Cold Day in Paradise,"I started reading Steve Hamilton with his latest The Lock Artist, which is a tour de force. So going back to his first novel probably isn't fair. A Cold Day has many of the flaws of any first novel, with improbable actions, risky steps to move the plot along, etc. But still it was good enough that I'm willing to try to the next one.What did drive me crazy was the number of typo's in a book published in 2000 and being sold today in a Kindle edition. Did anyone proof read this book? Or did they use galleys to create the Kindle edition? Does make one wonder."
4,Entertaining! This author's potential is truly exciting!!,"I simply couldn't put this book down. The verbiage, along with character and plot development were better than many experienced authors. I look forward to Mr. Hamilton's next book. Please don't rest on your laurels and become like Danielle Steele, Mary Higgins Clark, et al, whose first efforts were far better than their later works. Congratulations! I truly enjoyed this one - not predictible up to and including the ending."
3,A Cold Day in Paradise,"I thought the character development was terrific, the locale believable and the writing skilled. The only problem I had was with the plot. I did not find the instant animosity of the chief of police credible. I also was able to correctly guess what had happened to Edgar. But I'm a sucker for great characters and look forward to this author's next book."
4,My first Alex McKnight Mystery...,"...won't be my last.I know this is Hamilton's first in the series,but I just ""found"" him,and really enjoyed it. His description of the upper penninsula of Michigan,the cold/snow/wind off the lake....I felt the cold reading it.Alex,losing his former partner,him badly wounded,you really felt for him.A good who-dun-it,with the twists and turns of a good mystery.I look forward to reading more of Alex McKnight!!!"
3,Piggybacking on a tragedy,"This reviewer finds the apparently widespread idea that this book may have anything to say about Peru during the Sendero insurgency frankly repulsive. Its overall tone is reminiscent of conversations among expats at the bar of some upscale Lima hotel, enlivened by the gossip of bored Peruvian wives. A more appropriate title could have been ""Hannibal in Miraflores"" or ""Invasion of the Red Body Snatchers"". It my appeal to readers who enjoy a mix of cheap terror and soap opera, sprinkled with reassuring stereotypes about South America, but it has literally nothing to do with the tragedy of Sendero and Peru. This is a passably written thriller, period. If you want insight into those times, look elsewhere, starting from Gorriti's book and Palmer's collection of essays."
5,Best book available,"I am a veterinarian, doing my residency in poultry medicine. This is by far the best book ever written about diseases of poultry. I have the enormous pleasure of working with one of the co-editors, and the work done in this book is exceptional. A must for anybody interested in the subject."
3,Mailbox,"Everything about this mailbox is fine for the price, except it arrived dented. I banged it out and used it anyway."
3,It's a Mailbox...,"I received this unit as promised and at a decent price, however; it's not very high-end - it's a utilitarian box that will hold up for a time I suppose, however, I'm not over the moon with it. The flag is difficult to see from our house because it doesn't stand high enough and the box is kind of on the 'lightweight' side. We'll see...We had replaced a larger rural box that was very heavy steel because someone had run off the road and hit it - we had taped it up for a time, and that worked but it wasn't very attractive. There's a huge difference in the quality of the old and new (perhaps that's true of a lot of things though, folks!) In any event, I can live with it for as long as it holds up - it doesn't leak and the door stays shut - gotta accept that sometimes you get what you pay for."
3,Fuzzy beans?,"I was excited to get these for homemade vanilla extract. The beans seemed good quality but there was ""fuzz"" on them! And I found what appeared to be a white dog/cat hair. I pictured someone holding them against their sweater while trying to get them in the bag. I obviously have no idea how they got fuzz on them but I was disappointed for that reason."
5,Essential Reading for All Privatizers and Beyond,"Praja Trivedi once again wrote a very important book which needs to be at the fingertips of all privatizers (those working for the governments, development agencies and/or the private sector) so that they can all follow this meticulously explained and yet user friendly road map to get good results. Moreover, the politicians, members of the media and even the ordinary citizens in privatizing countries would benefit enormously from reading this book if they are willing to understand the best practice process and become better informed and equipped to support or intervene if things go wrong. I wish I had a book like that to follow earlier in my career. But it is never too late. I am grateful for Trivedi's continued willingness and energy to share his expertise."
5,the last wolf of ireland,I read this book in one day. I was so abzorbed in this book that missed some of my school activtys. The thing about this book is the author made it sad but intersting and happy at the same time. I realy loved this book and i hope you read it. The reason why is because it is a good hearted story. You need to read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Didn't Get It,"No context. Just stream of consciousness of the sort that makes you think the author might be on meds from time to time. Kind of an ""outsider art"" work."
5,wonderful book,This is the most wonderful book!! It is a modern fable appropriate for young and old alike. The illustrations really compliment the delightful story and the universal moral. Everyone should have this book!
3,Batman Other Realms : Other Realms,"Two beautiful stories done by Bo & Scott Hampton. The first story shows how the Batman solve a crime involving toxic waste which leads him to The Viking Prince who seem to live centuries ago. How? Well, you have to pick the book to find out.The second story has a Vertigo feel into it. An accident leads Bruce Wayne into coma. From there on, he's been meeting with ghost & demons from his past and a meeting with his wife? Batman or is it Bruce Wayne has to overcome all this fears & hope to get back to the real world before his lifesigns fade out! Will he return to the real world which is bleak & gloom when there's someone to love him there in the other realm...?"
5,What I think......,"Ok, i have not read this book, but from the other reviews and the synopsis, I know what this book is about. People that are interested in Jessica and Elizabeth's family history should read, Sweet Valley Saga, The Untold Story (about their father's family) or Sweet Vally Saga, i cant think of the name but it is about the twin's mom's family... Jessymin is in that book. If you are thinking about it, read both of them because they go together very well. There are also books about the ancestors of Lila Fowler and Bruce Patman. Go for it!"
2,Do not buy this product,The description fails to mention there is a seam on the belt that makes it impossible to do fine work with. The seam pops your work and causes uneven sanding to happen. I would never have bought these if I had known there was a seam on the belt. Garbage!!!!!
3,As Solid As Compilations Get - 3.5 Stars,"Compilations usually lack what an album by a solo artist or duo boasts: A cohesive theme. Thus, most compilations fail to achieve rave reviews, and Soul Survivor 2 is no exception. On the positive side, the LP is superior to its predecessor, Soul Survivor, and there are twelve solid tracks out of fifteen. A handful of epic cuts, such as Little Brother's ""Give It To Ya,"" and both of the tracks composed by Pete Rock & CL Smooth (""Appreciate"" and ""It's A Love Thing"") re-capture the classic aura of Pete Rock's early 90s production. However, blatantly mainstream tracks such as Posta Boy's generic ""It's The Posta Boy"" and Dead Prez's ""Warzone,"" as well as the thuggish rants of Krumbsnatcha on ""Beef,"" prevent Soul Survivor 2 from greatness. Cop this album if you are looking for original production and witty rhymes, not consistency."
2,Long awaited classic?,"I'm very disappointed with the way Pete Rock is going with the album because he seems to be trying to please eveyone's taste of music all at once. The album had some heavy hitters with the likes of: Little Brother, Pharoahe Monch, GZA/Genius, Talib Kweli. But, I find that inorder to make the album memorable like Pete's previous albums he should've used MC's like Rakim, A tribe called quest, or even the U.N. - considering that most of these people are dropping albums later this year.I recently went to a Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth concert in Febuary and it was a classic, mainly because Pete brought out that golden era stuff. The tracks with C.L. are the best tracks on the album, which leads me to believe that Pete should have just dropped another album with C.L."
3,History,"According to a bibliography of Merritt's work:In April 1934, Merritt published a chapter in ""Cosmos. Science Fiction Digest/Fantasy Magazine"", titled ""The Last Poet and the Robots.""This was as a round-robin novel published in 17 installments in the magazine. Later, in the October 1936 issue of ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"", Merritt published a stand-alone revision of the ""The Last Poet and the Robots."" He titled this work ""The Rhythm of the Spheres."""
1,Do not end up purchasing a new car lik I did!,DO NOT LEAVE THIS TEE IN YOUR TRUNK!! I noticed stange smell in my car shortly after I purchased this tee and placed it in my trunk with the rest of my sons baseball equipment. The only problem is that I was not able to figure out what was causing the smell until 4 days after we gave in and traded in our car for a new one. LEAVE THIS TEE OUTSIDE. It is was beginning to make our garage stink.
3,In Case You Were Wondering,"this collection contains Superman/Hulk, Spider-Man/Batman, Daredevil/Batman, Gen13/Spider-Man, GenX/Gen13, and Team X/Team 7. Not a bad collection, and plenty of pages make it worthwhile, since most of these books were prestige format, it would probably cost well over 30 dollars to buy the individual books."
2,A so-so book,"The stories really good are only Batman-SpiderMan and Team X - Team 7... the others are so ""light"" that don't deserve to be mentioned. A thing to see is Superman eating (something you don't see a lot in comics). The stories of Gen13 looks like Beverly Hills 90210 with superpowers and don't even has good supervillians. Don't waste your money, if you want to read it, better borrow it."
2,Not that effective...,"This catnip did not have a real impact on the cats. Maybe it was old and degraded but no matter what the reason it barely had an impact on them, even after smelling it closely."
5,Perfect Christmas Gift,"This globe was a replacement for another that I had ordered for my grandson's Christmas gift. The first one I ordered came incomplete with-out a stand and the seller refunded my money so there for I ordered this globe,both through Amazon.Since the other globe was a disappointment I was very nervous about this globe until it arrived.It is a 150% much better globe.It is so pretty.The maps are authentic and easy to read.It came well packaged without any damage.The stand was so easy to put together that my eight year old grandson put most of it together with very little help from his dad.He was so pleased with it, discovering countries he had never heard of.We have had fun looking for the different countries and I believe it has helped with some of his school work."
5,YAHOO!,"Nothin' like driving down a dirt road in Texas with Frankie Laine crackin' the whip and singing ""Rawhide."" Sigh. It's a little bit of heaven, all right. Gotta go somewhere and no one wants to ride with you? It's a GOOD thing! You can sing along with Frankie unmolested! YAHOO!"
2,Not impressed.,"Not impressed with the unit. Dropped dead after a day of mild use. Nice shape and lots of potential but the unit simply stopped functioning so soon; also, it includes two blades but a cover for only one of the blades. The smaller, sharper metal-cutting blade has no plastic protection. I'd stay away."
3,Takes an engineering degree to install the blade,"As previous reviews have noted, getting the blade installed in this saw is a heinous exercise in patience. I spent two hours fiddling with it and finally took it to a hardware store, where they discovered that the hole to align the blade was out of sync--but nowhere in the directions does it tell you that to adjust the screw on the other side of the release button, you MUST press the button in order for the screw to move. Once aligned it's still difficult to see inside to align the blade hole and saw. Good luck..."
4,Electric Saw,"The Black & Decker Powered Handsaw is the second one I have purchased, the first one bought two year ago and after an new kitchen, 16 x 16 deck and a 8 x 10 add on bathroom the head broke. The new updated PHS550B, type 2, has a larger head to mount the saw blade. The old model PHS550, type 1, really work great and will order the head for the old one when they are taken off back order. My wife can use it also, the handle is still a little large for a woman to use, but she likes it better than the old circular saw that was real heavy. It makes a nice cut and there is no saw dust thrown back in your face. The blade makes a clean straight cut even at the end and the blade also can be started in the middle of the board,. it will pierce through plywood in the middle of a long cut so you can go from both direction. Great all around tool."
3,Blade Installation,Help...I can't figure how to install the blade into the saw. I know it sounds ridiculous but can someone help me out?Many thanks!!
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,My daughter has had a baby stroller for 6 months and I thought this would be a good upgrade for her. But she isn't really interested in it. She pushes it around once or twice a week and puts some things in it but overrall for me it was a waste of money.
5,durable and fun,"My daughter has rammed this thing into everything, and it keep tickin'. And thankfully, doesn't do any damage to the table, the wall, or the couch. She used it as a walker when learning to walk. Now I have another daughter, and they fight over who gets to push it. I may have to get another one...."
3,Fun and durable but for older kids,"My 20 month old daughter loves to play with her shopping cart. Unfortunately, this one is poorly designed for her age and height. She has a hard time reaching into the bottom of the basket to reach stuff and it frequently tips over on her when she does. She has gotten hit in the mouth more than once when it fell over. I have since picked up a smaller cart at a yard sale and am putting this one away for another year or so."
2,Save your money!!!,"This was the most disappointing purchase ever! When we got our cart, we had to assemble it ourselves. No big deal since my husband is a very handy man. The toy wheels come in 2 separate parts and it was impossible putting them together. My husband struggled for so long. These pieces were a bit warped and never fit into each other. None of the four wheels were able to fit together. What a waste of time! There is no need for the manufacturer to make the wheels in 2 parts - one solid wheel would have worked and would have saved the aggravation. We ended up returning the product and will never recommend it to anyone."
3,little tikes shopping cart,"It's not fun when children get hurt...this newer version which is taller and more narrow than the older model was a big disappointment. The cart tips forward easily causing the child to fall or flip over the cart. The old version, which had a wider base did not do that. I would not recommend this toy until your child is at least 3 when they will be taller and not as likely to tip the cart and hurt themselves."
1,Quite possibly the worst Visual Basic book - period.,"I was forced to use v5 of this book as the classroom text for an entry level Visual Basic course I tought at a local college. I was frustrated with it, the students were frustrated with it; it is AWEFULL! This version is no better.I can't fully express how terrible this book is..."
3,Sonny With A Chance Sonny's Big Break(Volume 1),"The first DVD already came out. The Second DVD never came out. On Wikipedia, the Sonny With A Chance page said, DVD Releases - Complinations - Sonny With A Chance: With A Chace Of... - May 8, 2011(usa) - ''New Girl'', ''Sonny With A Kiss'',''Sonny With A Choice'', ''Marshall With A Chance'', ''Sonny With A Grant'', ''My Two Chads'' - Bonus features include a bonus episode, ''Sonny With A 100% Chance Of Meddling''. The DVD also includes a ''Work of Art'' Music Video and Interview with the cast. They never heard it on TV, Radio or magazine."
1,If only I could give this negative stars,"This album is so bad it is insulting. If you are in a situation where you may have to hear the album, please take my advice and get out of the room as fast as possible. The only good thing I can say is that I now know what the worst album ever made sounds like."
5,It was a hard to find,"It was a hard to find replacement item, that makes the set complete. It is a very versatile skillet."
4,Gave to College Son,"With a son in college attempting to cook for himself after being burnt out on the fast food regiment. I purchased this pan to help him along with a variety of items. The lid which acts like a strainer keeps the dishes at a minimum and insures we are draining the excess liquids off the food. The pan is a pan, does what it is supposed to do - good quality, good price."
4,Our favorite pan,"Have had this pan for at least 5 years, using it several times a week. It is versatile and it gets a lot of use because it really is nonstick and the easiest to clean ever! The only con is that the handle can get hot and, less often, the knob on the lid, so we put a little quilted pot holder thing on the handle every time after washing just as a precaution and reminder. The nonstick finish has just recently started to wear off on the side, so need to get another before it gets worse. Can't complain since it has definitely served us well considering the cost."
3,it lasted just less than a year,"I really loved this pan, very multi purpose so rated it 3 star even though it only lasted less than a year.I would say if you use it close to once daily it wont last a year. Even though I usedall plastic utensils it started peeling around the sides which makes no sense as the contact with spatuals was on the bottomof the pan. Disappointed I had to toss it."
5,Best fry pan,"I love this fry pan. It has a spout for pouring and the lid has built in strainer. The handle is strong, well balanced and stays cool. The pan heats evenly with no hot spots and the non stick coating is wonderfully non stick. Love this pan."
3,Danger Close,"If you want a great book that will give you superior tips on the mindset of getting into or staying in top shape ... you must read ""Danger Close."" It has 32 pages of pictures and 400 pages of incredible text. Danger Close likely will leave you wondering if you could handle the challenge of Green Beret training, but it will never pull punches on what you need to do to win."
4,Funny and Poignant,"I picked this up from a used book store the other day and couldn't put it down. When did David Brenner switch his parents for mine? I felt like David was writing about my folks, with their idiosyncracies, love, family squabbles, and striving for success.This is an intimate autobiography, filled with laughs, about growing up poor and Jewish in West Philly. David has never forgot his friends from that period, his family, or his values and concern for the poor and disadvantaged. ""Kingy"" achieved lofty success beyond his wildest dreams, but one foot has always been firmly planted on the ground. His anecdotes and recollections of life on the streets of West Philly are touching, poignant, and very funny.I had no idea he was such a gifted writer, it's a shame (as usual) this book is long out of print."
2,Could be better,"I had to read this for a college course and it was just boring. If you're interested in the Cold War or Civil Rights, you may find this interesting, but otherwise you're going to have to work hard not to fall asleep."
2,Disappointing,"I have read all of Mr. Kruegers, Cork O'Connor books and have been really happy and impressed with the writing. But this one made me angry because it was NOT about Cork. It was about teenagers. The writing was not up to Mr. Kruegers usual standards. This book should be taken out of circulation, it is not worthy of Mr. Krueger."
2,Caveat Emptor -- Not Original Recordings,"Yes, it's cheap. But that's because the majority of the tracks are new recordings. They assure this it is by the ""original artists"", but goodness knows how many lineup changes have occured since the original recordings from decades past. According to the track listing, the only original recordings are ""Surfin' Bird"", Here Comes The Judge"", ""Splish Splash"" (but by Sha Na Na--feh!), ""Mule Skinner Blues"", ""Alley Oop"", ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"", ""Short Shorts"", ""The Curly Shuffle"", and ""Beep Beep"". The rest are new. They sound approximately like the originals, but I am not interested in ""approximately"".If I'd known all this, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,All in all....,Not a bad collection. I wish they would of included The Ballad of Irving -- but you can't get 'em all on just one album. :)
1,yuck,"My kids spat them out immediately. I expected that from my 3 year old, but my 7 year old isn't picky at all."
2,Dreary novel - didn't grab me,IThe Night WatchI ordered this book for the first meeting of an on line book club. We're all current or retired English teachers living everywhere from CA to MI to NY to SD and Thailand and pretty much no one cared for this book! Takes place in England and the book was as dreary as a British winter. It never grabbed me.
4,'as if grief is a fallen house and one has to pick one's way over the rubble to the other side',"Quite a gripping tale of linked characters. It opens in 1947 and we meet masculine Kay strolling through London seeming to have lost her purpose in life...odd Duncan, living with his uncle and working in a factory with a group of apparently slightly disabled people...Helen and Viv running a marriage bureau. I was immediately drawn into wanting to know their histories.Waters works back in time; the central part of the book is 1944; the short finale 1941. The writing style put me somewhat in mind of Monica Dickens, and the world of the blitz is brilliantly evoked. All the characters are well drawn- I particularly felt the peripheral character Mickey to be really convincing.Utterly enjoyable read."
3,A disappointment,"Fingersmith is my favorite book and Affinity is wonderful. I even liked (not loved) Tipping the Velvet. So I have been anxiously waiting for Waters to come out with a new book.If it wasn't Sarah Waters I would have given it up at page 100. It was extremely slow with almost nothing happening in the first 150 pages. After that you get into the book, wanting to keep going and expecting something big to happen...it never comes. I just finished the book last night and went back to the beginning to see if there was any real resolution to any of the stories because it ends at the beginning. Even in the beginning you do not get an ending. No ENDING NO RESOLUTION. Overall i was incredibly disappointed in HOW MUCH description she gave to every scene. When you knew something was going to happen and were anticipating it, it sometimes took a good 40 pages and then its like a sentence worth of detail you'd been waiting for. Overall I would not recommend this book for first time Waters readers."
2,Ponderous & Rather Boring - Her Other Books are So Much Better,"I have enjoyed all of Sarah Waters books (especially Tipping the Velvet), but was surprised to find Night Watch to be, frankly, quite boring. Too much unnecessary detail. I kept thinking ""Ok, get to the point"" in several places. I though some of the characters were quite compelling, but the story wasn't well put together. Starting in 1944 for one third of the book, then reverting back to 1941 didn't seem to make sense to me. Sometimes that works, this time it really didn't. I'd like to pluck the main characters of this novel, sit them down, and have Sarah start fresh with a clean, crisp, well-put-together story. There's a good book hiding in here, but I was just barely able to suffer through the poor construction and overly laborius description of this one. I will, however, continue, to read Sarah's books unless this problem continues."
3,Good but not Great,"This novel is interesting in concept -- going backwards through time to delve into how a set of characters ended up where they are at. And the backdrop of war time Britain is marvelously dark and wrought with peril. At the same time, I was disappointed by the lack of true depth to the characters. Unlike other novels by this author, it is more difficult in this novel to dive into the characters' heads. Perhaps Viv is the most fleshed out of the lot, and even then, it takes a bit of work. Duncan, Helen, Kay all fall a bit flat. I kept hoping to capture more of their spirit. A much better novel by this author would be ""Affinity"" which plumbs the depths of the characters' psyches and delivers a delicious twist in the end. Perhaps that is why I was a bit disappointed with ""The Night Watch"" -- while it is a decent enough creation, it doesn't linger on the mind the way I've come to expect from such a talented author."
2,Not up to her other novels,"Let me begin by saying that Sarah Waters is a wonderful writer. She has a way of using words that is absolutely amazing. However The Night Watch is not really up to the standard of her previous novels. The trick of beginning the novel in 1947 and then going back in time to 1944 and 1941 just doesn't seem to work. The characters are too bland and cliched to really engage your interest. Her descriptions of London at war, however, are wonderful and make you remember why you love her books. I would recommend Affinity (which I think is her masterpiece) or Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet. I hope she returns to form in her next book."
2,"Boring, no plot.","I was very disappointed in The Night Watch. There was no real story, just people going about their business from day to day. I actually found much of this book to be a bit depressing too. I loved her other novels, especially Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet. They were wonderful and suspenseful. I hope Ms. Waters' next novel will be more like her first novels."
2,"dull, dull, duller","I try to finish all my books to the bitter end, but I had an especially hard time with this one. Waters departs from her Victorian underworld lesbian heroines to explore well, I don't really know, but I'm sure the War has something to do with it. The intertwining stories of Helen, Viv, and Duncan are told backwards (a lot less interesting than one would think) which allows you to get just invested enough in the present day characters that you start to care about where they're going rather than where they've been. Waters writes beautifully, but I can't help but think that this story lets her characters down. All the straight men are morally suspect if not morally weak. The lesbian love triangle is predictable (fyi when your girlfriend introduces you to another woman it's highly likely they were romantically involved). The war is just a pretense here to make things go not very far."
3,It was depressing,"I absolutely love Sarah Waters novels. I just found this one to be sooo depressing. There is no doubt that she is a wonderful novelist, but I have to agree, that I really did not like the characters. Maybe Duncan, but otherwise,I did not feel much compassion for the other characters. It is hard for me to like a book very much if I do not find redeeming qualities in the characters in a novel. The War Time historical part of the novel was very well done. The idea of meeting civilians in wartime London was also quite fascinating. But I have to give the overall review at only 3 stars. At one point during the book, I was ready for the whole lot of them to just jump off the London bridge."
2,Don't need ZzzQuil after this schnoozer,"Zzzzz. Zzzzz. Zzzzz. What was that? Oh, that was me, waking myself up while watching ""Picnic at Hanging Rock.""OK. I'm kidding a bit. I didn't really fall asleep, but I wish that I had. What was the point of this film, really? Did someone read a little too much about Sigmund Freud's work, and say to himself, ""Self, how may I take some of Freud's theories and put them to work in a movie?"" To be fair and a little bit more reasonable, I believe that women might take some offense to some of this stuff.Was this film based upon a true story? I looked around the web and I'm still not sure. And after wathing, I actually don't care. You might like this film, but my guess: you won't. Maybe watch this movie and call me in the morning. Actually, don't do the former or the latter. But if you do the former, at least you won't need any ZzzQuil."
3,Mysterious happenings in girlhood paradise,"This tale of a bevy of Victorian era Australian teenage schoolgirls on a picnic outing to the outback couples some fine photography with a dark, almost eerie plot. It was one of the first of the so-called New Wave Australian films which I watched when it was first released. The plot initially unfolds in painful slow motion until the idyllic picnic scenes turn to a horrifying tragedy. The enigmatic disappearance of three girls which remains unresolved till the end can be interpreted in many ways, including in terms of contrasting themes of liberation and repression which are a definite subtext in the movie. If you have a special interest in Australian film, you must watch this at least once."
4,"Slow start, but great ending","I bought this book because the price and because I love a good historical romance. I will say that it took me quite a while to warm up to the main characters as they both seemed really hard to me. However, I stuck with it and wasn't disappointed. There is depth of character to both of the individuals that you might not find in other romances and you get to see that evolve to a very satisfying end."
5,"Witty, humerous, well-developed characters with personality!","The title of this review about says it all - wonderful character development with subjects who display intelligence and a sense of humor. A bit of surprise here and there and a good feeling when you finish the book. This was my first read by Loretta Chase but I'll be looking for more novels by this author. Couldn't put it down. Thank you, Ms. Chase, for putting this one at a discount price so we could sample your storytelling skills."
4,Witty indeed.,"The witty dialogue between the main characters alone, is worth 4 stars. Chase has the innate ability to turn simple conversation into an intelligent creative exhange. Very refreshing to find a writer who knows how to utilise dialogue in character development. All in all, I found this an enjoyable read about a seemingly irredeemable and flawed hero who finds redemption in the arms of a formidable opponent. Well written."
2,This book is boring,"This is the 1st romance novel that I have read. I found it to be dull and cheap reading. I didn't expect Dickens but I thought the scenes were predictable and tacky.But after reading this garbage, I will not read another romance novel. By the way, I am a 30 year-old man. Though I can say that this book taught me a new way to manipulate women. Thank you Ms. Chase."
2,Not what i expected,"With all of the great reviews, i settled in for a really great book, but I can honestly say I was very disappointed. Maybe it was the constant references to the devil and all of the devilish nicknames. But I think it was also because of the redundancy of the the story line, something I am not a fan of. It just seemed to be the same sentances over and over again. Like the story line just chugged along with nothing that interested me. And when the main charactors spend all of their time arguing and trying to outsmart each other-I usually get turned off. I will say the writer has a good sense of humor, but is about the best I can say. I really had to push myself to finish it. I have read loads of romance novels and in my opinion, this one is near the bottom. I just reread some of glowing reviews and I just dont get it. Chalk it up to each person having their own preferences I guess, which is ok!"
3,Not one of her best,"yes, yes, I know. Everyone else loves it. Loretta Chase is one of my favorite authors, but this book just didn't make the cut for me for several reasons. Though I loved the humorous overtones of the relationship between Dain and Jessica, I wasn't crazy about Dain and I don't think that a man who has lived to be his age with his emotional baggage would have changed the way he did. The book fell apart for me where Jessica shot him because that turned her into a nut case. And the Beaumont subplot seemed to be something the author threw in at the last minute. On the other hand, I love the writing style, and I loved the way the book opened about his birth and early years, up until the school part started, which was not interesting to me. I loved Jessica's spunk and determination. And I've read many other Loretta Chase books that I would give an unequivocal 5 stars to. Just not this one."
3,"Okay, but not great!","I have to say that I was quite disappointed with this book. It has gotten so many rave reviews and personally I just didn't care for it too much. The characters were annoying. Enough about Dain's nose already! And the story dragged on and on and on (something I don't intend to do here). Without giving away any spoilers, I also didn't buy the nice, tidy ending. This book is the first that I have read by this author and while I see wonderful writing and style I never came to like these characters."
5,Finally!,"It was about time the 2nd season was released. Touched by an Angel has been one of my favorite shows ever. The second seasons offers more heart-comforting episodes. This second season is led mainly by the original two angels: Monica(Roma Downey) and Tess (Della Reese) with help, when needed, of the Angel of Death. I certainly hope they keep releasing up to the 10th season."
5,FIVE STARS AND MORE! A BEAUTIFUL SERIES IN ITS PRIME!,"""Touched By an Angel"" is the best series television has ever produced. All Season two episodes in this DVD set are crisp, clear, clean and beautiful. The sound quality is perfect! God is perfect! Roma Downey, Della Reese and John Dye form the perfect ensemble of angels and the guest star line up is incredible! Gerald McRaney, Ted Shakelford, Linda Gray, Joan Van Ark, Joe Penny, Cindy Williams, Brenda Vacarro, Kathie Lee Gifford...the list goes on and on!! All I can say is please, hurry up and get season three out there followed by the rest of the seasons!"
4,Disappointed with the ResQME but the Life Hammer is good,"The LifeHammer was as expected but, and after several attempts on different materials, we got the spring loaded spike on the ResQME to deploy. Broke a few beer bottles lol I would reccommend this."
5,Great product,Its too good to use this cream.I will always buy this one cream enchants to mesiempre compraré ésta crema
5,Excellent Reading,"As one who has read the material in Dr. McClure's first edition, I would advise anyone interested in establishing his/her place where they rightfully belong to read the second edition. The first addition has a wealth of information. This second can be no less!"
5,Great Shirt!,Got this shirt for my brother for Xmas he loved it! Nice bright colors and loved the back of the shirt! An extra plus!
1,Don't waste your time,"I've had the ""metal foil"" come right off the disc with this media. Stick with TDK or Imation. Do not waste your money, or put your faith in HP Media. Their burners are great. Their media is junk."
2,buffy necklace,the silver on the necklace turned black for some odd reason... so now it is a black necklace.
4,So so,"This necklace is ok, it is not,an exact replica. But its still something Buffy would wear. It is really pretty tho and shiny"
4,Nice,Nice Condition.........i like it very much.......!!! Looks Like new book.........................Nice Condition.........i like it very much.......!!! Looks Like new book.........................Nice Condition.........i like it very much.......!!! Looks Like new book.........................
1,buckle snap broke within 2 weeks,"(BJJ adult) The metal buckle holding the chin strap to the ear guard snapped within 2 weeks of using it. Looking at the metal that snapped, it was pretty thin. It looks like anyone using it in live rolling would break it sooner rather than later. It's unfortunate, because there were positives if it had sufficient construction. The rubberish foam piece that was in contact with the head was very comfortable, and didn't absorb sweat at all. After working out, I would wipe the sweat off quickly and consider it clean, and it never began to stink. The ear space was large, and rarely moved enough to come in contact with the ear lobe. I was also able to hear out of it better than other head gear. And of course with the colors, it looked good.Too bad they chose to cut the wrong corner on a higher priced product that should have been 90+% profit already."
4,Tornado Wrestling Head Gear,this piece is sturdy & Im having lots of fun with it. I am a pro at Grappling but this is great for novices with issues of Cauliflower ear/lack of knowing how to defend during training/sparring & need extra protection
4,Very Good but snaps break too easy,"My son wrestles with this head gear and he likes it very much. It is cooler and stays cleaner. But the snaps break too easily. However, Walmart carries a 5/8"" snap repair kit $3.99 in their sewing section. Basically the snaps work like a rivet. The hardest part will be getting the old broken snap off. I used a Dremel tool with a thin cut off wheel on it."
2,A book easily forgotten,"I have recently re-read this book. Not a very memorable one. Literally. I didn't remember anything about it. Grant and Shelley are two lovers that you will forget as soon as you close the book.No matter how you want to put it, I don't like a teenager being kissed by her teacher who is nine years older than her. So if you find that idea disgusting, don't read it.But if you don't mind, this is a romance with some hot sexy scenes. Grant is overbearing, showing from the first moment that he desires Shelley. She is the perfect doormat who says 'I don't want to' but when he insists says 'Well, yes, I do'.And the end in a judge's chambers, well, it's perfectly cheesy and embarrasing. At least for me.So if you are a Sandra Brown fan, yes, read it. Or if you are a teenager with a crush on your teacher. Or fond of 1980s romances. But if you are not, you can skip this."
2,"A ""Classic"" high school romance","I just had to put this book down. My definition of a classic is something that transcends the time it was written. This book, obviously a very early one, does nothing to showcase the tremendous talent we know Sandra Brown has. This is a ""high schooler""."
2,Typical,Ok story. True romance novel. No real substance. Not nearly the caliber of current Sandra Brown novels. I'll stick with the current books.
3,"""Average""(?) Cabell","Cabell in a younger day presents the American manifestation of the geneology of Dom Manuel of Poicteme. A light, ""quaint"" period piece with only the slyest hint (or foreshadowing (?)) of the ""supernatural"" and characters that will become the creators of the legend."
2,Built up and then let down,"This book was the usual Star Trek episode in which their is a huge build up and then ""squish"" nothing... Do not buy this book, borrow it from a friend. If you are interested in Star Trek books I would recommend ""The Return"" by Shatner (believe it or not Bill can write) or The Fury Series. The Fury Series is also called the INVASION series. I give that one a ten!"
3,A good Star Trek Next Generation book,"The author took a bit too long to get to the meat of this story. On the up side, the diversion with an alien species of rather powerful technical means was my original suspect as to how/what the bad guys were in this story.There were enough indirections to keep the reader interested. I finished this fast reading story in 4 sittings.A weak spot in this novel was the lack of any significant information or purpose to the ""Intellivore"", other than consuming energy from the brains of other species. The species could easily have been called the ""Intellibore"". This made the method used to defeat the creature(s) a bit more easy to swallow.And what of all those synaptically dormant survivors? Yikes, a few tragic lose ends."
2,memory lapse,I can't even say anything about the book because I don't remember it. Go figure....And I just read it a couple days ago. Better luck next time.
4,"A light, enjoyable read.","I love this series. It if fun and easy to keep up with, nothing too heavy. This time, Jim is asked to do a column on interior design. I had to laugh, because interior design is so non-Qwilleran, but of course, as is true to form, he finds himself right smack dab in the middle of murder. If you enjoy mysteries where language and violence are practically non-existent, this is the series for you."
4,Very entertaining.,"I love ""The Cat Who...."" books. They are well written, light little mysteries that never fail to entertain me. I wish now that I had read them in order starting with this one."
5,It's Grrrreat!,This is another one of the early Cat Who...books so that means it was written in the 60's. All of Braun's early novels are excellent and so is this one. I love how Braun describes that decor of the apartments and the food and things like that. No other author has got that technique down as well as Braun. This book introduces the third member of the Qwilleran family Yum-Yum. A female feline to keep Qwill and Koko in line. She doesn't have Koko's sleuth powers but she is special none theless.
5,rayjoy@ipa.net,"This is by far the weakest book I have read by Bruce. I enjoyed it, but I think anyone that has never been in Nam would have trouble understanding it. After having read the other books by Bruce I was mildly dissapointed in this one. I am not saying it wasn't a good book,but I think Bruce has put out better books.Roadrunner 6 Out"
1,STINGRAY,"This book is so redundant with military stats and jargon that it has no flow what so ever. a book right out of the military files, very little personal battle field information."
2,Ooooooooooo It was sooooooo great1,Wonderful book I read it about 238975 times. It scared me because I'm sooooooooo much like the countess' daughter
3,"That's right, EVERY name in the Bible is here...","For those interested in the meanings of Bible names, this is a great book. Every single name in the Bible and its meaning is listed in alphabetical order.This book also helps individuals pick names found in the Bible for future babies.The only drawback to the book is the lack of pronunciation guide. Sometimes Bible names like Melchisedec or Sarsechim can be difficult without a pronunciation guide. Another drawback are the strange charts inserted throughout the book that show ""alternate names for Christ"" or ""alternate names for the Church,"" etc. I found some of these charts somewhat out of place in a book on names. All in all, this book is worth it if you need to know the meanings of some of the less common names encountered in the Bible."
1,Even the names are incorrectly displayed!,"If you look inside this book, you will find that the Bible's hyphenated names are not hyphenated, and there are no guides as to where to find these names in the Bible. Look in Strong's Concordance for them. What happened? This is nothing more than a nice-covered skeleton of a book. Will somebody PLEASE come out with a Bible Names Dictionary that has the information we need? This book is absolutely a waste of time and money."
3,nothing new,This book is a repeat of a Paul Chek....only his is in cd form. Not impressed with Ms McKeith...
5,great informative book,I loved this book. It really opened my eyes to how deficient in nutrients I had become. Very inspiring.
2,I call her Doctor; she calls call me Admiral,"I've met Gillian McKeith, and what I like best about the woman is that she complied with my request to be addressed as ""Admiral,"" desptie my lack of naval experience. In response, I cheerfully called her ""Doctor,"" despite the fact that she isn't one.McKeith has been rightly criticized for trafficking in pseudo-science regarding oxygenated blood and DNA and poo and so on. Given that much of her advice is ultimately sensible (eat your fruits and veggies, etc.), should we give her a pass? No."
5,delightfully informative,This book was delightfully informative. I enjoy Jillian's tv show and was anxious to read her book. I was not disappointed.
5,great reading,"Encourages you to want to change yout eating habits so you can feel one hundred percent better and healthier. This is the easiest ""diet"" you will ever want to be on because it is not a ""diet"". I feel wonderful and have been losing weight so easily."
4,Great job at cleaning surface,"I got this to clean my ceramic range (Schott Ceran). The pads and cleaning solution do a great job. It takes some elbow grease, but the result is undeniable. I was never able to get convential cleaners to work well.My only complaint is that the scraping blade kind of cheap. It works, but gets dirty very easily and is difficult to clean."
5,Great Product,Works great & it's a great price! Works like a charm on hard & old stains on a ceramic cooktop. Cleaning pads help to minimize using too much on one spot.
2,Doesn't work on tough stains,"Bon Ami works better. The cheap razorblade that comes with the kit was what I used the most. I suppose its great for older, dull appliances (seems more like a wax than a cleaner)."
3,Fuchsia indicator better,Works well enough I suppose... The table that I tested seemed to have very minimal traces of lead. It was hard to tell though because the indicator moves from pale yellow to brown to black to indicate amount of lead present. I had sanded a portion of the table that I tested so I couldn't tell if it was the stain or the presence of lead that turn the indicator swab a brownish color.Worked well but would be much better if indicator colors were non-neutral colors. (LeadCheck Instant Lead Testing Kit for example)
4,Very Helpful,As a mother this is a great product for testing things to make sure that my little one is safe. It worked really well and has detailed instructions along with clear results. I would definitely recommend this kit!
1,Kit arrived with NO TESTING SOLUTION INCLUDED!,"First really bad transaction I've ever had on Amazon. This kit arrived, unopened and intact, and upon my attempt to use it, I discovered the small bottle that was supposed to contain the testing solution was empty - it never had anything in it! Obviously, kit was completely useless."
2,Lead Test Kit,"In order to use this product, you must ""cut"" a small chunk out of the product you wish to test. I bought this to test my grandchildren's new toys for lead. Who can carve a chunk out of magnets or many other types of toys? Wasted my money."
4,Very satisfied,"I am very happy with the test kit. I tested many dishes, and one came up positive for lead, so I am pretty confident that the test works. Used sparingly (and using more of my own q-tips than those supplied-only comes with 2 that they say to cut in half for 4 tests), the small vial of lead test solution was actually enough to test about 14 items. Am ordering another kit to test more items. The test solution is stinky-smells like rotten eggs, and they recommend testing in areas with good ventilation, which is appropriate."
3,Disappointed with amount of test solution,"While I can't verify that the test works since everything that I tested came out negative, I will say that the kit provides only a tiny vial of the test solution and the vial was less than half full. So I was only able to test 5 surfaces before I ran out of the test solution."
2,Only a Piece of the Puzzle,"For a classic book such as this, I am disappointed that the Napoleon hill Foundation chose only to complete one of George Clason's stories. The entire book should be completed for the world to share.Perhaps the only good result is that this one story may convince listeners to read the entire book!"
5,Doggie Ramp,I purchased this ramp for my 10 year old black lab so he could get in my expedition it works great and is even narrow enough to use on side door with alittle work. (dog is 100lbs and it did not even flex)
2,Save your money,Its too heavy and awkward to move. Easier just to lift the dog- I don't use it- money was wasted.
4,helpful,I was interested in starting a cichid tank and this book was very helpful. fill with good tips and ideas. I would have like more photos. I decided after reading the book that cichids where too hard for be to handle due to the size of tank needed and a small amount of fish one can have. I have a discus tank instead
2,This is the Workbook!,"I was looking for the casebook, this is the workbook. They'd better put the word workbook in the title or book description, otherwise it is very confusing."
3,Angus - broken noses,"The Film was produced in 1995. But nonetheless it's still up-to-date. Popular actors you might know from other films like American Pie, are Chris Owen and Arianne Richards, who plays in Jurassic Park. The Film is about Angus a fat kid who loves Melissa a popular kid. As you might expect 'fat'and 'famous'don't fit well together. That's the reason why you can look forward to a lot of fights and broken noses.Eventhough there are aggressive scenes, it is also a romantic and consistently funny film. Intrested in this mixtue of content ? You will enjoy watching this movie."
2,Wedding Bell Blues,"If any songs from the 1980's sound cheesy by today's standards, it's because the producers and artists took themselves seriously back then. But the bottom line is that most of the songs were good in the first place.The same cannot be said here. Creating instant nostalgia has proven to be an undaunting task for the songwriters. Instead of penning a collection of tunes that sound like they were actually written during the 1980's, the listeners have a soundtrack of cheap knock-offs of the sounds of said decade, which is very demanding for an audience.On the flip side, the performers are quite good, and there seems to be an indication that these numbers need the visuals to accompany them.Otherwise, these songs should have been left to be altered."
2,Not that Good,"I haven't seen much by Andrew Dice Clay, but I really liked The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. I also liked a movie I saw him in with The Unknown Comic, so I watched this act.This wasn't that good. It was Dice - but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it was as dirty and disgusting as ever, but it was as if he had lost a legal battle and had to start doing 100% politically correct acts if he ever wanted to perform again. He did in fact seem really tired and beaten down in both the performance and some revealing footage before the performance.I'm assuming that's what he meant when he explained that he is ""over here now"", and when he said that he was able to move over here because he is a professional. He did not elaborate.Just this one example. Big fat wives are the best kind and their husbands don't treat them right. If a man goes out to play golf when he could be doing his big fat wife, then his big fat wife should be doing every one of his friends. That was about the funniest thing he said."
2,ROLL THE DICE AGAIN,"It is time to give it up, all the same jokes and the same shtick, only this time alot less funny. Poor Dice, a once cutting edge comedian now just can't cut it. We all know the nursey rhymes and they haven't been funny for about eight years. A word of advise Dice should stay away from insulting the fans, you can only get away with it when your big... and still funny. Sorry Dice you just look desperate."
1,Taste like chemicals!,"I should have known better, but I tried this anyway. This doesn't taste like pistachio at all. It taste like chemicals. A little drop of it got on my hand, and no matter how many times I washed them, the smell would not go away. I threw it away. I'm just glad it was only $3. Yuck..."
2,Mediocre at best,"For me, this book stood out from many others of its kind because it is written by Cosmo. I bought it and I wasn't disappointed, per se, but it wasn't orgasmic bliss, either. These positions are nothing new for anyone that's experienced. Really, rather than 75 new and exciting positions, expect to not recognize maybe 10. My boyfriend did seem to enjoy pointing to a couple of these and suggesting we try them, however, so I wouldn't say it was a total raw deal. I just would've rather seen something more innovative."
3,A Little Too Much Hype,"This book would be a lot of fun for very young couples. For older couples, most of the positions covered in this book are going to be familiar. Some of the more difficult positions aren't good for much, unless you're going to compete in the Olympics or you're going to make an erotic video. We have had a lot of fun with a few, though. Disclosure: We've been married 25 years."
3,"Good, but many typical positions","While the book was interesting to look at and provided some unique positions, many of the positions listed were typical of my fiance's and my nightly fun. Also, I am much shorter than my fiance so many of the positions were difficult to enjoy. I would still give this book 3 out of 5 stars, though! Fun and intriguing!"
2,Overpriced for value.,"The base is actually made of wood, not bronze. It is described as a sculpted bronze resin replica. I may have been a little delusional to think that it would be bronze given the cost of bronze, but after seeing the globe (which is well crafted) I felt I paid too much."
2,"Interesting, But Not Too Addictive","Abel Ferrara gave a shot at the vampire genre and the result is ""The Addiction"", an interesting but flawed movie that fails to convice. Lili Taylor plays a NY philosophy student who gets bitten by a vampire woman. That experience will change her life and the way she views the world, offering new perspectives and goals. While this is a somewhat promising idea, the plot never sems to surprise all that much, so it gets a point where it keeps repeating and moving nowhere new.The movie touches a few points like existencialism, fate, guilt, sin, faith, nihlism and of course addiction, but the development could be better and it ends up seeming like unfullfilled potential. Still there are some intriguing elements, like the black and white cinematography, the moody atmosphere and some compelling, well written dialogue. But even considering these good ingredients, the movie doesn`t step above average material. ""The Addiction"" just lacks bite."
5,Who doesn't LOVE Lucy?,"Great show that will never go off the air. She was what a comedienne was all about and has certainly given today's comedians ideas and inspiration. I love you, Lucy!!!"
5,THIS ALBUM IS TASTY ..JUST LIKE HONEY!!,IN THIS ALBUM BY THE POPULAR LEBANISE SINGER(SABAH) YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THE BEST BELLE DANCER SONGS THAT IS SANG BY HER..SHE OWNS THIS POWERFUL VOICE THAT KEEPS YOU HAPPY AS SOON AS YOU LISTEN TO HER..THE SONGS ARE SIMPLE...EXTREMLY SIMPLE..BUT HARD TO RESIST!!

FIVE STARS ARE NOTHING FOR THIS SABAH.
5,a must for nature enthusiasts,"Laurence Gonzales has been studying the lives of survivors in extreme outdoors for over 30 years. He offers many captivating anecdotes of climbers, sea enthusiasts, fire fighters, World Trade Center victims and especially his father who he admires the most. Each account is an enjoyable lesson, covering the psychological context of surviving and the rational decisions that each person goes through while lost or in desperation to live. This is a must for nature enthusiasts."
4,Not What Was Expected but...,"I purchased this book for my husband after hearing about it from a instructor in a CPR class I took...I told my husband about it and he wanted to order the book...it wasn't exactly what he expected it to be and after he thumbed thru it, he laid it down for servral days...well when he picked it up again, he said he couldn't put it down as the stories we very inspiring...we will be ordering it for our grandkids in the future and based on what my husband said about the book I will also be reading it..."
2,Not very good,"I bought this book without hesitation; it sounded so interesting! I found after several attempts I just couldn't read it, it was that irritating. A typical page consists of various quotes from other writers (just to show the author knows what he is talking about) and then another reminder (in case we'd missed it the first few hundred times) of what separates ""survivors"" from the rest of us. Apparently it's psychology.The author also likes to inject himself straight into the centre of the story. Which can be risky if you aren't particularly likable. Other writers (e.g. Krakauer, who this guy is presumably striving to emulate) know when to stay in the background and let the stories do the talking.Not recommended."
1,painful to read,Deep Survival needs another editor. The poor literary quality makes the book awkward and irritating to read. The author's attempt apply science to survival situations is unconvincing. The author appears to be unqualified and his analysis of each situation is brief and incomplete.
3,Not quite what I thought,"This book is heavy on the author's pseudo-psychology and light on the details of the actual survival accounts. The author applies recent science to the accounts but it is not presented that well. What really turned me off is that the author doesn't really know how to reach his audience and seems to be too consumed with himself. I found the early going a bit difficult as far as maintaining my interest, even haphazard in approach, but the book did become more enjoyable toward the end.If you want an intellectual read with a layman's semantics from someone who is not a psychologist (just a privileged man with connections who happens to a have a deep interest in survival), then this is the book for you. If you were hoping for a in-depth look at the details and events surrounding various survival incidents you'll be disappointed. The subject matter of this book offers so many interesting possibilities but in this case the reading just did not satisfy."
3,Mixed reaction.,"I was expecting tales of adventure and survival. There certainly were those, but the majority of the book is taken up with analysing the psyche of those who survived vs those who didn't. Fascinating in its own right, of course, but I was in the mood for story, not reflection."
2,Where's the beef?,"Deep Survival is a book that retells stories of survivors in the wilderness, and in doing so attempts to teach the common denominator in a person's mental preparation that enabled the individual to survive. The book's focus seems to be placed on mental preparation and mindset to the exclusion of other skills, such as how to stay alive in the wilderness or to plan ahead in case of trouble - a big omission to my way of thinking. So, what are the big buck secrets of Deep Survival? This is the sum total of what I learned from it: Stay calm, don't take risks without measuring possible risk/benefit, and don't be macho when your life is on the line. That's it. I didn't really need a whole book to learn that, but your experience may be better than mine. Me, I think Stephen King's character Red said it a lot more succinctly: 'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin..'"
3,"Worth a read, but...","Deep Survival promises a lot more than it delivers. The book is a difficult read because the author tends to skip around a lot between survival stories and his and other's philosophies on survival. In the first chapter he starts out slinging more similies than a bad rapper, which luckily tapers off in subsequent chapters.Another complaint, albeit minor, is that there are several misspellings in the book (for example, the German city Ingolstadt is spelled ""Ingostat""). It doesn't really detract from the book, but it is a sign of sloppy editing."
4,Edger Blade,"These are great home owner use blades. However, they wear down very quickly in a commercial setting. I wish McLane made a commercial blade for their edgers."
5,"Rock my world, anytime...","I have heard numerous complaints of the quality of this recording, which I respect...however, there is NOTHING that prevents each and every song from standing out like the proverbial beacon, beckoning and calling you to dig your heels in and groove. I wish I could relay just how much it means to have a band like this in my personal space. A rare find, often played and always enjoyed. Future now!"
3,Disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with the beginning of this game. It seems that all you do is go from one battle to another using the rock,scissors,paper rules.I'll try a little further and see if it get's any better. Right now it gets a 2.5 out of 5."
1,The game sucks.,"This was going to be a scathing review, but the store let me return this for full price - so I'm a lot less angry now.Let me say that I'm a fan of the Final Fantasy series, my favorite being Final Fantasy Advance Tactics for the GBA. I wasn't crazy about any of the Crystal Chronicles. That said, this game sucks. And I mean badly.First of all, the gameplay is painfully frustrating. You have to use the stylus to encircle and attack enemies that are often off-screen. It takes so much dragging and swiping to get the screen to move, and when it finally moves, you and your foes are never on screen at the same time. On top of that, the camera view moves so slowly that by the time you and your enemies are meeting, everybody in your team is already half dead.Then the characters are way too small to see. Break out you bifocal reading glasses.This game looks and plays like it should cost 9.99 retail. It's very cheap looking and poorly done. Worst game ever."
1,Snoozefest,"I am a devout Final Fantasy fan, and I loved XII, so this games was a HUGE disappointment for me. The plot and character motivations are flimsy, so I'm not really sure why I'm fighting in the first place. But even worse, the combat style is terribly boring! You spend lots of time and energy putting together your own personal army of summoned creatures, but if you think you'll be able to keep them alive, think again. The battles become these big lumps of chaos, and it's difficult to precisely target characters, so healing is a pain. Even your main characters are almost impossible to keep alive for long. And everyone moves soooo slooooowlyyyyyy. This game put me to sleep. Square Enix, you can do better!"
1,PSP Tribal Flames Skin,"I bought this skin for my girlfriend psp that i got her for Valentines Day, 1st of all the skin is stiff and the sticker is thick so it won't bend to your psp curves. I put this skin on a brand new psp right out the box so there was no dust or finger prints on it, skin stuck on the psp for like 10 min then started to bubble and peel. No matter how much i push it back down it keeps coming back up and peeling. This is only after less then 24 hours of being put on the psp. So i would stay away from this skin, it's junk and shouldn't be put on your trash can let alone your psp system. If you want a good skin get a wraptor skinz i got one for my psp system and now i also ordered one for my girlfriend psp system, did a little more looking and found a better skin in the same design."
4,good for the price,It took a little work to fit the rifle but turned out well also you have to do some sanding to smooth out the seems from the molding process but the price is right.
1,End Your Game...,"I just can't deal with typos, maybe thats just me. Well let us just say this book has its share. There are better endgame books on the market. Maybe this would confuse more than help a novice cuz of the errors. If your used to rushed out books with what lumps some positions as common. Jacks in a few lines that have errors and are not even checked sometimes. Then you would just love this book to death. The price is not so bad for the book, so least that is something. So if you wanna get a thrifty book over a good one, go for this one. You can get a bunch of books from this black hole. Most smart people just avoid books from this author. So to anyone that does not know better, be very weary getting books from this guy."
4,High school memory a bit blurred.,"I wanted my teenage daughter to read this, remembering it fondly from HS English class. I see now that Ms. Godden was really writing to that age, as I found it a little less interesting at 46 than I remembered. Still much better reading than a good deal of teenage books."
5,awesome,I enjoyed the message and story. I appreciated how the characters came from average households and average lives. It is a story not far for many of us.
4,Overcome - a good message,"Enjoyed this movie, mainly for the good message, The acting was good and the plot believable. I would more movies like this."
1,DSH,"his is a great books if you are intellectually challenged. I have not met an intellignet, thinking woman who actually enjoyed this mess. Hooks should have stopped writing a few years ago. If you are interested in good feminist literature, read anything but this misdirected mess of garbled platitudes.Move on...."
3,Not really saying anything new,"I have always admired and respected the formidable intelligence of bell hooks. I have read her books since Ain't I A Woman when I was still a sophomore in college. While I don't agree with everything she says I feel her vision is quite insightful, but Feminism for Everybody is just recycled rhetoric, which has been a pattern of her books as of late. I feel this book is like every other book she has done, saying the same old things without any new insight or enlightenment. The one thing I notice is that for all her suggestions she never has a concise game plan on how to solve things based on her theory, although when she does criticism she is the first to write of other authors who don't share any type of solutions based on their rhetoric.This book is good for people who are ignorant and have a fear about feminism. It is a good introductory book, but if you're a seasoned reader, or activist I suggest you move on to something more substantial."
5,Best book ever!,I recently purchased this marvelous comprehensive book and I cannot believe the superior quality! The pictures are unbelievably clear and I love the checkoff boxes to keep my collection organized. The prices are much more accurate than I have ever seen! Say good-bye to Florence and hello to Mauzy!
1,As Close To Useless As Could Be,"Awful. Just awful. I know the book is inexpensive, but I literally would not have paid more than 25 cents for it if I had seen it before purchase. Very little information about few types of shakers. Spend a little more for the excellent Gene Florence book."
5,Only one word needed : Inspirational !,"Having taught for a number of years in a Montessori environment, this book was like a breath of fresh air. From the first page I was hooked, understanding all. The book gave my staff and I may wonderful ideas for our classrooms, and made us really focus in on the importance of the Montessori method again. The best book to give to new staff members, Directresses or assistants; parents. So inspirational at a time when we were in a rut. Thank-you Paula for writing such a vailable book."
2,Way too analytical for a preschooler,"I bought this book to read to my 2.5 year old who was about to start preschool. I was hoping it would help her transition but the book was terrible. Every page has several paragraphs of ""what to expect"" information that goes right over my preschooler's head. She doesn't like the book at all, not even the pictures. I wish I would have returned it but didn't want to pay the shipping when the book was so inexpensive."
2,Way too wordy,"I got this book for my 2yo who starts preschool in the fall. There are many first time school books but most of them are all ""I'm nervous about school"" or ""I'm worried about school"" or ""why school isn't scary."" I didn't want to introduce school with such negativity. However, this book is way way way too wordy. No way he sits through it. It was $3.99 so I don't think I'll waste postage sending it back, but I'd skip this one. I also bought ""Hooray Hooray Preschool Day"" which is much more age appropriate."
1,"nice case, but do not purchase for use with the armband","pros: The case is very nice, fits ipod well and the wheel still works nicely.cons: Has a a clip on the back of the case that allows it to lock into the belt clip, so ipod won't lay flat in case. Is meant to be clipped on the armband with a belt clip. This is a complete joke, as ipod flops all around during exercise and could easily fall off the armband. I can not reccomend."
2,Nothing like the original Cocaine Cowboys,"CC2 really has nothing to do with Cocaine Cowboys except that Griselda Blanco is mentioned. CC2 is the glamorization of Charles Cosby's (who?) successful life of crime and his thug cronies. It's hardly a documentary and shouldn't be a sequel to CC1. If your looking for a follow up to the captivating, well written, well edited, and well produced CC1, this is not it. If you want a hour and a half long rap video to go along with your Scarface collection, have at it."
2,:(................,"I THOUGHT I HAD BOUGHT A GREAT ROCK/POP EN ESPANOL CD......BUT I DIDN'T. THEN AGAIN ITS JUST A ROCK EN ESPANOL CD AND SOME OF THE SONGS DATE BACK TO AROUND 1983. THIS IS BEFORE MY TIME AND I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HEARING ROCK EN ESPANOL THAT DATES BACK TO THAT TIME. INSTEAD I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET MUSIC THAT WAS MORE TO DATE, AROUND THE EARLY 90'S..........BUT I WAS WRONG AGAIN. THIS CD IS PROBABLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR PARENTS.:("
4,solid... but heavy,"I've owned and gigged one for about a year now. Great board but as said, even empty, it's pretty heavy. I'm here looking at them again because I'm looking to either buy a second one to use with mine or the larger version. I've got too many toys to mount to mine ^_^"
1,It is not a NEW work!,"It is not a new book, it is a combination. If I had not picked it up in a brick/mortar Barnes & Noble (and put it back even faster!) I would have bought it at full retail. It is labeled on the back cover in small print-Crusade and In Death Ground. I would prefer In Death Ground be combined with The Shiva Option, honestly!"
1,"I agree, poorly written.","And usually I can tough things out but the dialogue was so banal, so crappy, that I couldn't continue. And it wasn't believeable. Is it a cliche to say the characters were 2 dimensional? Well they were. I didn't get past 15 pages. Sorry Edith Felber. I don't know who Mary Jo Putney is (except for the glowing review your book cover boasts) but she has terrible taste in writers!"
1,Overpriced and not worthwhile,"I found this to be a rambling, directionless waste of time. The demographics they specify of in the book for promoting a band are totally a construct of the authors imagination. The tech stuff is really dated. There are alot of really good books on the music industry, this is not one of them."
4,Need more tech than investment savvy,"This book came to me highly recommended by a friend and I read it in no time at all, very well presented and very readable. The only thing is to get the most out of it you need to have a lot of tech knowledge. I work for an e-business consultancy and I found the idea of picking the basket of stocks in a potential Gorilla industry a bit of an intimidating task. However, it does point out you can make a lot of cash from investing later in the game as it becomes more obvious who the key player is, this is probably a better approach than the one they advocate for most people."
1,The Hijacking of the Humane Movement: Animal Extremism,"If you're looking for lessons in paranoia, then this book is for you. The authors of the book must live in some nether world where imaginary enemies lurk behind every bush. The entire content is an exercise in neurotic thinking. The teaching of fear and distrust is as dangerous as what the authors claim the animal rights movement is doing. I can see why none of the larger publishing houses would have nothing to do with this treatise. My neighbor does volunteer work with our local humane society. I guess I should notify the FBI that she is a terrorist. I am forced to rate this book with one star because no lower rating is available."
1,Pretty silly!,"In this book, you'll find a lot of hype, but no backbone to their arguments. The Strands seem to be very angry, very fearful people. Perhaps they had a uncomfortable run-in with an anti-fur type? Whatever their motivation for writing this book, its content contains more ""extremism"" and disinformation than any ""animal rights"" debate I've ever heard."
2,Not so bad,"Before I watched this movie, I read very negative critics about it, but I decided to check it anyway,mainly because of Woody Allen.This movie was not made to be taken serious. It's a crazy comedy, with lots of surreal elements and an absurd plot. It's a story about a butcher who kills his wife, picking her to pieces. Accidentaly, he looses her hand, which is later found by a mexican bind woman, who believes she's cured by a miracle. Then, the news are spread, and the whole city of El Nino believes in the power of this hand.It may seem stupid, but it is actually a critic to fanatic people, who start believing in everything they see. The cast was well chosen. David Schwimmer plays a priest who is in love with a whore (shocking, isn't it?), proving that he can do more than Ross (Friends). Woody is funny and neurotic as always,and it makes the movie worth your money.Of course, this is not the best film you'll ever see, but it is funny in a certain way."
1,Utter stupidity,"One could easily bear the fact that this movie seems to fullfill the whole range of mexican-related stereotypes, after all it has happened before in Hollywood, but casting Woody Allen, Cheech Marin, Maria Grazia Cuccinota, David Schwimmer, Lou Diamond Philips for delivering these superficial caracthers in the context of an absolutely stupid story is sacrilege.I am glad this movie never made it to the big screen.I hope that Woody never gets to see it, or he'll need another 50 years of therapy.We see jokes failing helplessly one after another.As the pythons would put it: a complete waste of time!! If you want to see some real Mexican point of view, I reccomend Amores Perros.A little darker, perhaps."
2,Not a good movie,"Thanks to all the truly bad movies ever made I didn't give this one star by default.Woody Allen is only an actor in this movie, and lends his usual persona to it, but I don't know how much input he had. I can't find any credits for him as writer in the synopsis and he didn't direct it.The best that could be said for him in his defense is that it wasn't his idea.I guess this is some auteur's distorted idea of a ""madcap macabre"" comedy, but it doesn't work.It IS frenetic, but not funny."
3,Surprise! The film was SUPPOSED to be absurd!,"No, not every joke works, but many do. And yes, it's completely irreverent, a bit disrespectful and a hair gross at times. The language is kind of rough. But it's still an enjoyable, if not constantly funny film. And it was definitely supposed to be lopsided and offbeat, with, I think, some intentional miscasting to a degree. The problem is, I tried to order this twice, and it got cancelled both times! I had to buy an import. Amazon... can you really buy this now????"
4,Great pair of glasses.,"The glasses arrived quickly,just a day after I ordered them though the shipping was quite high.But overall I am happy with the purchase.I bought these online because I live in a rural area and any stores out here did not carry this particular style of sunglasses.They are trendy and you don't feel guilty paying the designers price.They are snug and the sunglass arms fit well around the ears,and provides enough shade due to the oversized flat lenses."
1,Oh My God,"To each their own I suppose, but I have trouble imagining how anyone could say this is ""true"" to the original and excellent Bourne series. We no longer need to worry about whether Jason Bourne can be killed, he'd likely hang himself if he ever reads this book.The prose is grating, apparently written with the aid of ""The Histrionic's Thesaurus."" No cliche is left unused, and the writer apparently tries to use the most overwrought descriptions and word choice whenever possible.I really wanted to know how the book ended, but at the halfway point I finally gave up; no need pouring good time after bad."
1,"If you like to watch your ""stories""....","Bourne is the one of the top action-adventure characters of all time. Tortured, deadly, capable of making those responsible for a bad day pay and pay and pay. Lustbader takes this incredible character and plops him smack into an episode of ""Guiding Light"". This book was bad enough to tick me off. Not just disappoint me, but convince me he needed to be horsewhipped."
1,Major problems with this book,"To open, I loved Lustbader's Nicholas series. I found the series to be very well written. However Lustbader apparently only skimmed the first book ""Bourne Identity"" before he sat down to write ""Legacy"" as there are numerous factual errors in the Bourne character of his book that clash with the original series. There were so many that it was actually hard for me to finish Legacy. Maybe ""Legacy"" occurs in a parallel universe."
3,"Good, but not for Astronomy fans","On reading THE BOURNE LEGACY, a couple of sentences stopped me cold. In page 217 of the St Martin's Paperbacks edition, it says ""Dr Asaph Hall discovered the two moons of Mars. Nobody knows why he chose to call them Deimos (Anxiety) and Phobos (fear).""There are several objections here. First, Deimos means ""Terror"" rather than ""Anxiety"". Second, the one who suggested the names was Dr Henry Madan, instead of Hall. And finally, the reason is well known: in Greek mythology, Phobos and Deimos were the sons of Mars.Other than that (for Astronomy buffs or nitpickers, maybe) the book reads well, though the writing seems ""speedier"", less wordy, perhaps, than the original Ludlum works."
4,Borne Legacy,"Excellent series, I find it hard to put these books down, they farewell written. I will happily purchase more books in these series."
3,The Bourne Legacy,"Not up to the caliber of previous Bourne novels. It did keep my interest, but many parts smewhat far out."
1,Who is the main character in this book? Not Jason Bourne!,"If you loved the bourne books by Robert Ludlum DONT read this book! It might have been an ok book if the the author just made up his own character. He didn't talk to Marie once in the book... a couple of text messages at the beginning and thats it, didn't even mention her again. Doesn't Bourne think about her while he's gone in this book. In the other books Marie was right there every step of the way.Bourne has also become younger in this book somehow... not mentioning his age once or how he's not what he once was. I would not recommend this book to ANYONE. Please don't read this book unless you haven't read any of the other good Bourne books."
1,"Weak Plot, Soap Opera Characters","Mr. Lustbader's first books were Samarai stories and his characters always had ""supernatural"" capabilities. He continues this type of theme in this book. Also, it is silly to depict an assassin who is willing to take unnecessary risks to look into their victim's eyes to see them die. The plot dragged and read like a soap opera."
3,Bourne legacy,Book was alright. Nothing like the first three. Easier to read and follow. Left too many questions unanswered. Will try Bourne Betrayal but not expecting much. It seemed like Bourne walked into too many situations that he would have suspected in the first three. He was always taken by surprised.
5,Fabulous book!!!!,"I have been a long-time fan of VLT's and, as always, she's delivered another fantastic read. Clever dialogue, an interesting plot with engaging original characters and a witty turn of phrase which makes turning the pages all the more enjoyable. It takes a special kind of author to make a nerd hot and Ms. Thompson does that with outstanding flair."
5,Better than the original,"All those who bought the original ESL version of this disc should buy it again! I noticed the 4 new tracks and a remix of Walking through Babylon and decided to grab the ""new"" disc and was NOT disappointed - well worth the purchase. More of the same innovative stuff from Eric and Rob."
2,Ooops! Bought by mistake,"After reading reviews and getting a personal recomendation, I went out to buy DJ Kicks. I picked this up by mistake and for the most part, a mistake it remains. I like reggae and acid jazz and while some of the tunes are okay, for the most part, I find this CD pretty boring."
3,"Nice, but the drum beats are a little overwhelming.","I ordered this CD and the OM Lounge 2 CD after searching for more music in the Kruder & Dorfmeister genre. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the overwhelming drum overlays in nearly ALL the songs on the album. Unlike K&D, the drums stand at the foreground RULING the music, which does not appeal to me personally. I prefer the soothing fluidity of K&D's soft, easy, and well-put-together beats. Although I am not completely disatisfied with my purchase, I would say that this album is a little more reggae and bee-bop than jazzy."
3,Beginner homemade costume,This outfit really is a bit disappointing. It looks like a beginner home sower made this outfit. The booties & the hat is cute. But the shirt and pants are wide and made out of some felt material that is stiff and sits awkward. The stitching is also done poorly. I'll try and make it work. Maybe washing it will loosen the material a bit.
3,Some will find it helpful,"This author put her heart into this book and offers her own personal philosophies about running a business, and it will be just what some people are looking for. I preferred the FabJob.com guides on how to start a wedding planning business and how to start an event planning business for concrete advice on how to get clients."
5,A great help!,"This manual was a GREAT help in getting me started in the field of special events planning. I keep it on the shelf in my office and still refer to it on occasion. My business is up and running and on it's way to becoming one of the largest and most successful businesses of it's kind here in Southern California, and I owe a large part of that success to Ms. DeProspo. Definately recommended reading."
4,Good Movie!,Action and Suspense! Liked the plot and loved the ending. Good acting and kept me interested. Would watch it again.
5,super,just like it sounds gone was great love watching a movie with a story line that keeps you interested the whole movie...
2,meh,It killed a couple of hours but could have/should have been so much better. There were a lot of holes in the story line. Also if you believe this movie all of the guys in Portland OR are really creepy looking.
2,Ok...Glad I didn't see in the theater,"It has a good story, but some of the characters development ended up on the editing room floor, leaving holes in the movie. The end was a let down."
3,Not well-developed,"This movie was siply 'ok'. I kept expecting a twist somewhere, but what you saw was what you got. I was left confused as to Detective Hood, though - I mean, why would the producers (or whomever) draw attention to his character, only to have him fade away? If they wanted us to think that he was the kidnapper, it worked, because I did. But when I found out that he had nothing to do with anything, he became a whole lot of irrelevant. It was just weird and without closure.Speaking of no closure, I felt sure the kidnapper was hiding in the back of her friend's SUV, seeing that they both lost signal at the same time and producers made it a point for him to tell her there's no signal out here and for her in a baffled state to say ""but we've been talking...""I felt like they got lazy with developing the plot and just wanted to find an end for the movie."
4,Gone,Pretty good movie! Very suspenseful. It will keep you wanting more. I don't watch a lot of movies more than once but I would definitely watch this one again.
4,Suspenseful Ride All the Way,"Nothing about the overall plotline of this movie is particularly innovative, but this film will probably hold your interest, and even keep you on the edge of your seat anyway. The main character's determination to find her sister, in the face of all official indifference and doubt, will have you rooting for her.She ad libs any number of clever cover stories to extract information from people along the way, rivaling the glibness of Rockford in James Garner's hit TV detective series. So there is some catchy novelty here, even if it's not necessarily in the film's concept or resolution.Amanda Seyfried does a great acting job, projecting intelligence and fortitude. Her character provides a good role model. She's a strong, capable young woman who is so much more than just a pretty face."
4,edge of your seat entertaining,"Amanda was amazing in this flick, she needs more roles like this. Good casting overall. edge of your seat entertaining. Director had me thinking she was imagining it all."
2,needed resolution,"It almost starts at the end of another movie and everyone jill talks to is a suspect in this who done it but the only real character is jill as EVERYONE ELSE is underdeveloped nearly bit parts....and the physco never says anything like this is why i did it and you never really see him in many scenes for such an important character who never gets id'd and really it fizzles the ending which should be a much bigger deal.I watched the trailer then bought it and expected a much better who done it...while it's in my librairy of purchases i don't expect i'd ever want to see it again with 1 real character,some supenseful moments and a fill in to many details plot especially in regards to the ending i'm sorry i bought /watched it."
1,too dark,Great plot. Poor image on my LCD. Changed and reset t.v. and video card settings but no help. Other shows look fine. ?
2,Ugh...,"I'm a die-hard Crash fan. I really enjoy every game up until Tag Team Racing. So yeah, everything until Tag Team Racing is good, and Tag Team Racing is decent. But then there's this... Crash Boom Bang. Why in the world did they even come up with this game? The mini-games are incredibly difficult and there is hardly any explanation on how to play each mini-game, there aren't even that many mini-games to begin with! The story is... Awful. The character selection should have been a lot bigger. The new character (and I suppose villain?) sucks. I have this game, and I play it from time to time, but really only because I am a die-hard Crash fan. If you are not a Crash fan, then avoid this game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Not a good camera,This camera was not up to my expectations.1. It is kind of big compared to other cameras which have more features and at the same price range.2. The picture quality was not good at all. I had a nikon L10 and when I compared it to the pictures from this camera the pictures from my nikon was far better.I regret buying this camera.
3,Great price - some glitches,Bought this for my 15 yo son for X-mas. All seemed well (he was very happy!) until we took a cruise on New Years Day. Three days into the trip (the 1st time her really got to use the camera) the telescoping lens would get jammed up and not retrack/extend. It has done this off and on since that time. We have always been able to get it to work with a little elbow grease. But it is something that should be mentioned. Otherwise he has been very happy with it.
5,Best Camera for the Price and Quality,"Pros:Best Price, Simple to use, compact, good zoom, enough pixels(you can adjust the amount of pixels on a photo, which saves memory space), uses 2 AA batteries, great quality photos and movies.You must read the advance user manual guide to get the best of it.I also recomend getting the Canon compact camera case, fits like a glove and feels protective.Cons:Memory card with the package only 16MB(I got a ScanDisk 2GB card from Amazon, very good) and the On/Off button is too close and same side as the shutter that you might accidentaly turn off the camera when taking a picture in a hurry.Other: If you use recargable batteries buy the ones with the highest mAh like NIMH 2500mAh and a worldwide charger (Sony has them)"
1,Very bad,"This camera is really a bad one from the canon.I have bought other canon cameras those were excellent but this particular camera frustrated me as it costs me my attention, time and money for nothing"
1,Cannon Camera,"Canon PowerShot A560 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom( I think this is the one) I returned it as I didn't like it at all. It seems very cheaply made and had AA Batteries, which I also didn't like."
5,"Simple to use, exceptional features for price","My 11 year old daughter did yardwork all spring to earn $$ for a decent digital camera. We then studied reviews, and found the Canon PowerShot A460. She has carried and used this camera non-stop for the past month, and it continues to stand up to abuses while taking photos better than my more expensive (older) Canon digital. She loves it, and is the envy of her group of 11 year old buddies. They make movie shorts, take it to the beach and sleepovers, roll under the dog, etc. The controls are intuitive, and under her own power she's figured out how to attach it to the TV to show off her work to family, download photos to our computer and send them to friends, send images to Costco for processing (with my permission), etc. I love that it used AA batteries. This wonderful little camera is keeping her entertained and educated all summer. Oh, and the photos really are amazing."
3,i guess????,"I received gel fast but to me it seems like it could have been filled more there was a small amount inside also the lid was sticky so I contacted the seller and they said let it sit and let the gel fall back down WHAT??"" To me for 11dollars there should have been more inside just go ahead and buy the bigger size...but it works well"
2,Very poor dictionary,"This is a big thick heavy volume printed in nice largefont on fine white paper, and it is mostly useless.I am a native Russian speaker and pretty good in English,having studied it for good quarter a century. I was lookingfor a decent dictionary to look up more difficult words,and I was specifically looking for one volume two-wayRussian-English dictionary for ease of use.This dictionary turned out to be a waste of money. It onlyhas the most primitive words both in Russian and Englishsections, no slang (and I am talking standard slang, notstreet speak), definitions are poor, very few synonyms.It may be good for beginners but as a reference dictionaryI would not recommend it to anybody."
5,youth book,"I find I always have to pause a bit with Eva Ibbotson's books - as they are pretty descriptive, but then I remember - oh, yes this is for THAT age group. I do enjoy Eva's plots and they do have different endings and different little things she wants us to learn about ourselves. I would recommend her."
4,Sweet read,"Eva Ibbotson is a fun writer, esp. for those coming out of smaller chapter books and going on for their own enjoyment. Her stories are full of adventure, great imagination, and kids who take charge and are pro-active (to use today's PC words) about their worlds. There are adults in her stories, and with this story, some are good and some are NOT, but it is the kids who save the day. This story is interesting because it is a fantasy based on real creatures....the white cows. Great characters, cute and fun and funny, and an engaging plot....recommended.My favorite Ibbotson is still the Star of Kazan. Beautiful story. Great for reading to 7-10 year olds. You can't really go wrong with Ibbotson!"
4,Its a good read... too bad about all the bigoted reviewers,"Not Barkers best....but Please people, hating a book because the main character happens to be gay...is so absurd..which by the way you find out in like the first three pages..If that offends you... flip through a book before you waste time reading it.. and then... keep your prejudice to yourself. Reveiwed by a heterosexual."
2,Not my favorite Clive Barker book,"The story is decent in some spots but if you are expecting something rich and stylized like ""Weaveworld"" or ""The Great and Secret Show"" then you are going to be disappointed. Reading it is a long, frustrating and laborious process. The story is boring and the most interesting characters aren't used enough. The ending is anit-climatic and you find yourself wishing that something truly terrible would happen to the main character just to make the story interesting.It would have been ok if it had been written by a different writer, but my expectations for Clive Barker are high (and probably unreasonable)."
1,Not good,This is a cheep chair.the armrests are to high and it wears you out trying to roll the thing around!!!!
5,This answered most of my questions about reloading.,"I purchased this, hesitantly, after buying another reloading DVD that I found disappointing. However, this was a pleasant surprise. It was so detailed that it immediately solved a problem I was having understanding trimming cases. I would venture to say, that if you had just bought a press and watched this video, you'd be able to sit down and start reloading immediately.In fact, the only negative I had was I didn't care for the background music between chapters. I have recommended this to friends."
5,Great all around song book!,"This is a refreshingly accessible history of song and song book. The intro is well written and actually makes you want to use, read, and play the songs more. Each song has a brief history and in the music there are guitar chords as well as the basic score. Great gift for the family or as a school book!"
2,Bad after taste,"My teenage son and I are both GF, and we're always trying whatever new GF products we can find. Some have been terrific, and some...not so much. These bars definitely fall into the latter category. Besides being chewy in an odd, unpleasant way, there was a VERY strong and persistent aftertaste. We tried all three flavors and had similar results with each. I would suggest trying to find them locally to try first (our regional grocery store carries them) before buying a whole box through Amazon."
3,A slice of pie it is not,"It is good, but if the goal was something to make you think you are eating a slice of pie, unless you like pie with a *lot* of crust, this does not achieve that goal. I was expecting more filling I guess, after reading the description. It is good, just not ""a slice of home made blueberry pie"" good.You'll want something to drink on hand too as it can rather dry out your mouth."
5,Absolutely Delicious!,"I really did not expect these bars to be so satisfyingly delicious and actually taste like a piece of blueberry pie. BUT they do and I was pleasantly surprised. I will surely buy them again and look forward to trying other flavors. These are a win-win for someone who is craving something sweet and delicious and healthful and they are gluten-free, not something I have concerns about but many people do!"
4,Natural Home Health Care using Essential oils,Daniel Penoel and Rose Marie Penoel have given the English speaking countries a gift with this translated version of his French book. The author artfully outlines an overview of essential oil history. Penoels philosophy shines through his descriptions on home treatments with essential oils. Treatments that any lay person can accomplish. The only downside is that their is no listing of suppliers. Especially suppliers of Roselina oil. I only hope that he will translate his other book that is only available in French!
1,This is one way of doing things.,If you want your kids to earn every penny they have than this is a great book. If you are less militant than this book is way to extreme. It is very biased towards having the kid EARN every penny they get. I believe that some money should just be given to them.
4,Nice Buy for Little Kids,"A nice selection of songs on the first two disks. The music reflects the tunes without being over-produced. best of all, kids do the singing! All of the music is a little fast for my four year old granddaughter. She is learning and singing along with the mic. The third disk is Sunday School music and the fourth is patriotic music. . I'll keep this one, but not wild about the second two disks. I wanted to broaden her repertoire of traditional nursery songs."
5,Demolition Is Fun!,"This is absolutely the best recip blade that I have ever used. We reclaim wood pallets to burn in our wood stove (which are free). I had been using a standard 6-inch blade ($4.95 at WM)but they heat up, bend and break after using them on about 15 pallets. Gets mighty expensive during wood 'harvesting' season. I ordered these by Bosch (Swiss-made) and they cut through hardwood like a knife cutting room-temperature butter. It is a good blade meant for heavy work."
5,so cute,"My son loves Courage! It really is so cute. We had a delay with shipping-didn't make for Easter as planned, but he was happy either way!"
2,Shallow but amusing,"Extremely fast read and it kept me hooked. The inner workings of how SNL functions on a weekly basis are fascinating; however, after a while Mohr's stories felt more like random celebrity name-droppings than meaningful content. Mohr's short two-year stint on the show wasn't nearly enough time for an in-depth perspective on the show's meaning and changing casts. Entertaining nonetheless, and provides some good cocktail party anecdotes."
3,BETTER than the book,"I read the book of the same name, but then I found out that there is an audio CD of the book with Jay Mohr reading it. Since the book was very conversational anyways I decided to pick up the CD as well. I found it to be even BETTER than the book! It starts off rather stiff with him just reading but then he gets into it more and throws in some personal touches including doing impersonations of some of the people he mentions in the book. Also, his emotions occasionally come through when he's talking on the recording. There's no way to pick up that emotion when you're reading the book."
2,Not Enough Meat,"The first time I noticed Jay Mohr was in Jerry McGwire. He played a back-stabbing agent who double crosses the hero in the movie. I thought he played that rather well. Based on his book, it's because he is that guy.I didn't find Jay Mohr to be a ""warm fella"". His writing is matter-of-fact and well...cool. There is no emotion to his writing nor does he remember anyone fondly with the exception of Farley, but only highlights his ""manic"" stages.On one hand, I can't blame the guy. He was at a rough period (a decade or so) where the show had lost its steam. Mohr was coming in the SNL train as young guys like him: Sandler, Farley and Spade were getting noticed with the best sketches and that must have been tough.But he wussed out. He was in the same school as newcomers Molly Shannon, Norm Macdonald (who Jay discloses too much detail on his bout with food poisoning), Rob Scheidner (who Jay hates), and didn't graduate from the SNL Academy with honors.His revenge: this book."
2,3-D is a pass.,"Just received my combo of Ghosts: Journey and Ghosts: 3-D. Very disappointed in 3-D. The vast mojority of pics are from old photos we have seen many times before with the attempt to ""3-D"" them. I bought the book for what the movie 3-D was and came away very disappointed with the content."
2,Works good but broke,This item works but when it arrived the outside was broke. Someone called from where I purchased it from and said they could refund the shipping cost. But when I called them and left a message no one ever called back.
2,Disappointing,"I like Cokie Roberts, listen to her on NPR, etc. etc. Perhaps it was because I had just come off from reading ""John Adams,"" but I was very disappointed in this book. There didn't seem to be much in the way of original research, it didn't challange me to rethink history, and I really wasn't blown away by how these women did much to change the course of history in the grand scale. Nonetheless, there were interesting tidbits of historical information, and a reader may learn some new stuff."
3,I liked the original better,"I liked the original book, Founding Mothers: Women of America in the Revolutionary Era by Linda Grant DePauw 1975 better. (Wonder why Amazon is not offering it...)DePauw gave a detailed portrait of all women of that era, including blacks and native Americans, Loyalist women and much more about the time and culture for women. Roberts just gives us a glimpse of the only culture she knows, that of elitist wealthy politicians' wives and daughters, like herself."
3,Actually between 3 and 4,"The book has quite a few interesting bits that I had not been taught in school. I wish there had been a timeline in the margins as the organization was sometimes confusing. I believe now I will read the original with the same title.Having said that, I am currently reading Mercy Otis Warren's letters. I admire Cokie Roberts greatly for being able to wade through these women's tedious flowery language and find the substance beneath. So I should have given it four stars."
4,great research Cokie!,"Although it reads like a history (herstory) book, these are very important stories to be shared with the general population; these stories should not just be studied by women's studies students. If you're any kind of history buff you should find these ""backstories"" of the revolutionary period in the U.S. compelling and a necessary part of the whole picture of the time."
5,A Rare History Told,"Here is some truly fascinating history that they just didn't teach you in school about how the wives of American presidents influenced their husbands' political decision-making and influenced the collective culture in turn. It's wonderful to see things from the vantage point of some of these remarkable women and to read these various eye-opening biographical stories of courage and sacrifice--great little anecdotes that prove that more often than not, these women were not simply sitting in the parlour-room knitting, they were taking an active political part in the life of their nation. Very informative without being dry, very well-researched and scholarly yet very readable.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
4,next time a bigger bottle ;)...,"Used it in vegan ice cream (uncooked). Used it up in no time ;) - taste is good, but gone fast lol."
2,OK if You Want A Lot of Information,"I was dissapointed with this organizer when I received it. I was looking for more of a journal/ organizer type of book than an informational book. This would have been a good gift for my first pregnancy but I wanted more space this time around to record doctors appointments, tests, ultrasounds, etc... This book just doesn't have it.Wish I had stuck with the one I used for the first baby, What to Expect When You Are Expecting Pregnancy organizer. A lot more room to record your own info.I would give this as a gift to a first time mom though."
1,Waste of money,"For someone who loves Helen Bianchin books , i felt this was a total waste of time and money. I hated Tasha's character completely. Don't waste your money reading this....."
3,Don't Bra Shop Online,"This item arrived in a timely manner and as described. I had owned Calvin Klein bras before and I thought that I was purchasing something similar to the items I've had in the past. I was disappointed to discover that this is not the same bra I had. It doesn't fit quite the same and it's somewhat uncomfortable. I think this is probably just a matter of personal taste. I've learned my lesson. When buying bras, make sure you try them on first."
4,ROBIN WRIGHT-PENN IS A GEM,I read the book and was a bit disappointed with the film.I did however like the performances especially Dallas Roberts and Robin Wright-Penn. RWP is one of America's finest actresses.She is overlooked so many times at award season. People take notice she is a force to reckoned with...I also enjoyed the original music by Dunca Sheik.
2,"Slow, unlikely, and mostly uninteresting story","What Michael Cunningham does best in this book is the little things. Similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on. The story itself, told in alternating first persons, spends most of its time telling us about the characters, especially toward the end. It seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others. First, people don't analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree. Second, the characters actually do very little when not analyzing.Two other issues are the improbable three-way love affair and Bobby's indefinable sexual orientation.The worst problem of all is that this is a character-driven novel and I just didn't care about what happed to any of the characters."
5,Redefining the family,"Whenever I am asked to recommend a book, this is the one. I've read about 150 books since A Home at The End of The World was published and have not read one better. The first paragraph alone does more with language and character than the great majority of novels concocted in this decade.This book has complex, living charcacters, exquisite prose, moving episodes and on top of it all, is about something. Cunningham considers the question ""what is a family"" and explores it movingly. His answer, as you'd expect, has little to do with bloodlines and legal bonds, and everything to do with love."
3,should have kept the old beginning,"I just really couldn't get into this. The characters aren't sympathetic. I'll admit the story is original, though not real great. The mutants aren't all that interesting--neither look or power wise. Wolverine makes a brief appearance, though nothing spectacular. This just didn't draw me in the way X-books usually do. I wish they hadn't changed it."
3,not very awesome,The multiplayer is this titles saving grace. compaired to IL=2 Sturmovic: Birds of Prey this game is sub-par amatuer hour.
4,"Psychoanalysis in the 50's and 60's -- ""A Horror Story""","""The behavior of the analysts...was not simply that they kicked patients when they were down. Even worse, they first knocked patients (or their parents) to the ground, by blaming them for having caused their own illness, and then they kicked them."" The author examines psychoanalysis in the 1950s and 60s when it was applied as a treatment for serious mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, autism and obsessive compulsive disorder. Well written, very readable and very frightening. At least in the days of leaches, the leaches were occasionally helpful..."
2,Efforts to re-write history,"As so many of the liberal progressives in the US have re-written history to suit their political beliefs, this author seems to be trying to do the same with Israel. I wish Amazon would note this type of liberal political bias when selling this type of book. As an American, I know what damage this type of thought has done to the country. One can only hope that Israel will not fall into the same trap that ensnared so many Americans. I am not a fan of liberal views put forward as historical fact."
5,I want more.,I love this series. Can't wait until the entire collection is available. I've not been disappointed with either the product or the delivery.
3,Like it but don't love it.,Protrudes out from the door a little more than I expected but it works. A double hook would have been better to match the Coralais line.
2,Not a great smock,"I purchased this smock before I bought a long sleeve more durable one and I was quite disappointed. The fabric is cheap and it will not last long. More importantly, however, is that it does not protect much. The sides are wide open and neck area allows large exposure of the children's clothes. Thus, their clothes are a total mess after any project, exactly what you were trying to prevent. I do not recommend this product."
3,"Flimsy, but fine","Pretty flimsy, but it was inexpensive, so it's good enough for light crafting in our house with a two year old."
3,"Don't know yet, it is for a February birthday.",Haven't opened it since it is for a birthday gift in February. It looks like it will do the job.
3,Best of Sugarloaf,"The best of Sugarloaf would be the double CD ""Sugarloaf/Spaceship Earth."" This collection seems to favor their post-Liberty work, which was not as good to me. They seemed to be more pop-oriented, less rock. The best cuts are, of course, ""Green-Eyed Lady,"" the long version (the single version was 3:33, by the way), and ""Tongue In Cheek,"" a fantastic guitar tour-de-force (long version)with great lightning-speed organ solo. Too bad lead vocalist Jerry Corbetta went on to sing in a latter-day version of the Four Seasons."
4,The Best of Sugarloaf (CD),Product was delivered quickly and arrived in perfect condition. I enjoyed this album of their best hits. Brings back good memories.
3,Yep it's dull,"I can confirm what the others are saying about the sharpness of the saw. Yes it's dull. However for the price you have a good deal. I personally cut off the handle, made my own traditional handle and it's now a $100 saw versus $17."
1,Awful saw,"Received saw, immediately set to cutting simple straight cut mahogany. This is without a doubt the worst saw I have ever used. I can't understand why this saw is so terrible, aside of the fact that the teeth looked completely unsharpened! They appeared to be stamped and not sharpened as though the saw missed an entire step on the assembly line. I was looking to replace a 10 year old, never sharpened, Stanley straight back saw. This saw left exit tear-out 10 times worse than that ancient saw.Sent it back the day after I bought it."
3,mankind,"I've played this game for just over a year an a half. The other reviews are right for the most part. Yes there is an awful lot of mouse clicking in this game, but this is to be expected with a game as complex as this. Is it boring, yes & no, it's more monotinous than boring. Mankind is as fun or dull as you make it!. The main theme here is construction, to research you have to build a lab(s), to get minerals you have to build mine(s),..etc. But what the others have not said is that as a player in MK, you get to meet many fun & interesting people from all over the world! For instance, i have met players from Norway, portigul, Italy, spain, germany...and you also can get to know these players as well. This is not just a game, it's almost an RPG in setup. I would hope that customers browsing through will try MK, if not for the graphics, which are very good, but to meet other people they would not have met otherwise"
2,Not what I would expect,"I have played Mankind for a year now.The game is set in a universe of well over a thousand planets (most likely much more). There are two problems with this ame.One, there is no tech support Two, the servers are often downWhen I say no tech support, I mean there is NONE. You can try to e-mail them, but the only response you get is in garbled English, and I have yet to get a problm solved by them without a ""reinstall the game and try again"" message.What you do get is a game that is more addictive than you can imagine. You must speak with other players before you buy. You can look around for forums to do so."
2,i think they like it,"used for quite some time ,every time i go in my shed there they are, yes it kills alot of mice but they are always there, itsd either a great product and i just have 100,s of mice that want to live in my shed or it dont kill them all"
2,"Don't waste your money, buy a different level","I just got my level and I wish the others who left comments had been unbiased or accurate in the praise and I wish I had not purchased it. To begin with the shock-protecting end caps are only 1/4 inch of hard plastic, a waste and they won't protect anything, they will probably just break within time, don't drop it. Also I thought since it weighed so much more than all the others of this type and size level that it would be strong, well, I was wrong, you had better be careful with it cause it bends so easy because it was not properly engineered or designed. Also the vials have like an oil used in them, meaning the bubble sticks and does not move freely. A total waste of my money, spend more and buy a box beam with curved vials for sensitivity."
4,An honest look at modern Italy,"Many people, perhaps Americans in particular, are desperate to hold onto their rosy visions of ""La Dolce Vita in Italia."" The truth is, the modern country is so much more complex and most of us are unwilling to look beyond the idealized Hollywood depiction. But this shouldn't discourage the hopeless Italo-phile, of which I count myself among. Indeed, the many layers of cultural complexity is what makes this alluring society so irresistible. Sure, ""La Dolce Vita"" exists. But so do 1,000 other versions of Italy, both of breathtaking beauty and heartbreaking tragedy.This book by Mr. Hoffman tells it like it really is: the good, the bad, and the ugly (to borrow from a Spaghetti Western). If you want to keep your Italian fantasies alive, go see ""Eat, Pray, Love"" or ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" But if you want to engage in an honest discussion, read this book.Teaching English in Rome, Italy: A Guide for Americans"
1,Quel null type!,"Oh, what a loser! I sat in the bookstore reading this book, and a very unusual feeling came over me: one that made me want to hide the book so that others would not have to read such fallacies.What an ingrate! He fled to Italy to escape trouble in Austria, Italy was good to him, and he rewarded it by writing a bitter and angry book that shrouds itself as something else. That is what we call biting the fingers that feed you. I was so happy to come here and see that other reviewers were as appalled as I was by the negative tone the writer takes in describing the beautiful people of Italy (some of my closest friends are Italian; I am Nigerian)."
1,not really worthy,"On top of the lyrics; which about a woman shouldnt be allowed to be said...i realize that every (CHOKE) artist that tells a story or tries to get revenge on someone like Eminem did...sounds very bad. Nobody can do it like him.Secondly ""if the cd is called I dont want you back, then why isnt it funny when there exists a track on the cd called ""I want you so back""? how dumb is that? Funny I have to say. A good artist would never divert from his title if he has lyrics such as these built onto his product. BAAD! Dont think he will last."
3,not the same as Gregorian Chillout 2008,I loved the album we bought first with the same name from 2008 http://www.amazon.com/Gregorian-Chillout/dp/B001P5EDQQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1296177672&sr=8-2 I loved it so much I couldn't wait to get other music from the same series. This older album is very good if you want just good old fashion chant. But if you are looking for the electronic chant of the 2008 album this is not it. I'm still confused if it's the same series or not.
2,Mildly interesting but certainly not deep.,"A comparitive survey of what differing religious groups (from Zen to Hasadic Jewish to Catholic to New Age and more) are doing to create a presence in Cyberspace, mostly the world-wide web.Not truly revelatory in either spirituality or the implications of cyberspace, but some of those interviewed have thoughtful comments on how they see the role of their work.This book is far from scholarly, and sometimes seems hurried into publication. It's closer to a series of brief interviews, combined with the author's reactions, than an organized exposition. There seems more strength in the cyber/philosophy side than in any religious area, mostly thanks to some thoughtful insights from one techno-philosopher. This makes it slightly deeper in technological consideration than spiritual, but neither area is treated rigorously nor with depth."
4,This is the Nora Roberts writing I love...,"Nora Roberts can write a billion more books like this one. I most enjoy her romance books. When she goes into mystery or plots where the romance is secondary I haven't enjoyed those books as much. In fact I was concerned the author was taking a break from the romance genre.I love the characters, a woman running from an unsatisfying life and finding love and herself in the process. Who wouldn't fall in love with the wonderful man in the book. We can all dream these guys exist (and stay that way!).I look forward to reading the other two stories in this trilogy. Nora Roberts' book trilogy featuring the Quinn brothers was also enjoyable reading. Check it out if you haven't read them.Thanks Nora for another fine romance!"
5,One of my faves!,"'Jewels of the Sun' and 'Tears of the Moon' (books 1 and 2 of the Gallagher series) are among my favorite NR books. They are both full of characters I wish I knew and places I'd love to visit. I finished the books feeling that I'd lived a short time in an Irish village!The relationship between Jude and Aidan is complex enough to be interesting, but not so angst-ridden as to be tedious. I could identify with Jude in the process of recreating herself, and I liked seeing the impact of it in the way she viewed herself and on her evolving relationship with Aidan. I also liked the little bit of magic thrown in! The character development seemed very well done. I felt like I knew the main characters well and really liked them. But there were also great secondary characters that I became attached to. Really fun book! It's on my keeper shelf!"
3,Have I read this before or not,Upon starting this book I kept looking back the cover page to see if I had read this book before. The characters and story line follow a lot like the story of Enchanted. I miss the story line and mystery of Hidden Riches. Would like to see more of that type. Thank you.
5,The first of many,This was the first book I have ever read by Nora Roberts. It is so magical and full of hope. I really can not wait to read the other two books in her trilogy. Jewels of the Sun is one of the best books I have ever read.
4,Interesting story.,"As one who does not usually read paperbacks, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed following Jude and Aidan in Ireland and even listened to the audio version. I am looking forward to the second book in the trilogy. I am definitely not interested in the supernatural or faries but did not find it so overpowering to dissuade me from finishing the book. Jude's growth throughout was interesting to read."
3,"Enjoyable romance in gorgeous setting, but nothing extraordinary","This is my first Nora Roberts novel and I have mixed feelings about 'Jewels of the Sun'.I loved the setting and the atmosphere of Faerie Hill Cottage. It reminds me of how visually stunning Ireland is!I thought Jude F. Murray interesting as character in the beginning of the novel. She's divorced and she struggles to find her true calling in life. Unfortunately she doesn't grow much as a character throughout the novel, which is unfortunate. Her lack of confidence and determination made me lose interest in her. Luckily the inhabitants of Ardmore brought some life in this story. Their generosity and eccentric behavior made me turn the pages.I've finished the novel in three days; I'm happy I've read this novel, even if it was flawed. If you're looking for an enjoyable romance in a gorgeous setting; this is it."
3,Jewels of the Sun,"Irish Trilogy - Book 1This was not a good read for me. I guess I am one that definitely likes her more recent work because I couldn't force myself to get involved with this one. This was not very exciting, and the story was lacking depth.Jude Murray runs from her life in America with a broken heard in tow, and heads to Ireland to study old tales and legends. She stays at her grandmothers' cottage, and likes it so much that she longs to become part of the community.Aidan Gallagher runs the local pub with his family, but is not prepared for the impact meeting Jude will have on his life. Through magic and deep sorrow of a ghost, Jude and Aidan discover their new path in life together."
5,Fall in love again.,"A tale of romance and fantasy. Explore the culture, folk lore and traditions of Ireland. I am wishing that I could just escape and live this novel. I spent many hours burning the midnight oil over this one. You will immediately fall in love with this tale. It captures your heart and imagination and holds on tight until you have finished. It stirs up memories of what it is like to fall in love. You easily transform yourself into the characters only wishing and hoping that you could again feel the emotions that they are feeling. Oh, to be that in love again! You will not be able to put this one down."
4,Realistic Characters in a Fairy Tale Setting,"An enchanting setting and a passionate fairy tale provide the charming background to this contemporary story that explores the complexity, independence and passion of two people from different worlds. The characters feel so real that you expect them to walk out of the pages and start breathing. A very fun and satisfying romance."
4,fun,"nora roberts is one of my favorite authors of all time, and it was fun to read a book with magic in it because i am more used to her modern day romance books. i read the rest of this trilogy too, it was also good, you xan tell nora roberts had a lot of fun writing this book and what happens between jude and aidan!"
3,"Not bad, I'll read the rest...","She didn't disappoint and she didn't excite either. The characters are likable abd the story is magical. It has to be, it takes place in lovely Ireland. It does lack, however, the Nora Roberts flair that I have become used to. Instead of sweeping romance this is the story of a woman in midlife crisis who just happens to trip over a guy and decide to keep him. Roberts had all the right elements; beautiful backdrop, intriguing characters and a good dash of the supernatural but didn't make them click. The book is worth reading if you're a fan but if a first timer to Roberts books read something more lovable like Hidden Riches or Convincing Alex."
3,If you crave more Maeve Binchy read this,The way that Nora Roberts spins this tale of relationships in a quaint Irish village was just what I needed (mind candy) when I read it. Reminded me of Maeve Binchy's works.
2,not at her best,I know that most people who read this book and the others that followed really enjoyed the series but I just couldn't get into it....I read about half of this book and had to stop and pick up something else.....I really enjoyed Adian and his character but I just couldn't get into Jude...And the fairie story that underlined everything was just too out there for me....I love Nora Roberts don't get me wrong and the idea of this story....Jude who placed her life on hold to go to Ireland and live in the house where her grandmother lived was a great background to this story but from there it wasn't a good read.....sorry Nora!
3,"Good Read, but not one of her best","This is the kind of book you read on a rainy day, and you have nothing els to read. Nora Roberts seems to bring the supernational into just about everything she writes lately, and she does not need too. Roberts is too good a writer, who should not need or result to such ploys to get her story across, that's why this book only got three stars. Her characters, Jude F Murray & Aidan Gallagher were strong enough to carry this story all by themselves. They were a joy to meet. Their supporing cast did the rest. Will I read the other two books of this series? One rainy day when I have nothing els to read."
2,Did not live up to expectations,"When i read the back of this book i genuinely thought it would be good i was however very dissapointed i love a good fairy tale but this book just killed it, Ms Roberts din't develop Aidan in any way, i feel like she had a good plot but din't know what to do with it and that just puts me off reading any trilogy involving any of the other characters."
2,Great book!,Never had on the description that there was a name written in pen on the inside page. Was really disappointed. If I had known that I would never had purchased it!
3,Received Different Battery,"The battery I received was a brand called Maximal Power, not the SterlingTek like mentioned. Also, the battery mentioned is a 7.2V Li-Ion, 1500mah. The battery I received is 7.4V Li-Ion, 900mah. The battery was sent from Thememstore, not Amazon, but I was aware of that.I'll see how the battery performs, and you certainly can't beat the price; but I do feel slightly snookered."
3,"Okay, but horribly unlikable characters","I guess the main problem I have with this book is that the main character and her best friend are so seriously flawed and unlikeable in their priorities and reactions that they are down right unlikely. What's more, the author not only seems unaware (or under aware) of this, she also leaves holes in the plot and character development for the sake of advancing the narrative.I might read Ms. Burton again, but she is certainly not Marian Babson, M.C. Beaton or even Melanie Travis.For more, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal!"
5,"Inexpensive, but very informative guide to trees","If you want an inexpensive but very informative guide to trees, get this book. The emphasis is on choosing the most suitable tree for a specific environment, with a special section on urban trees.The best part is an encyclopedia of 100 trees, with nice color photos of most. Information includes scientific & common name, hardiness, characteristics, ideal growing conditions, native habitat & varieties.Additional general information covers transplanting & caring for the trees. There are also very useful tables on trees best suited to different geographical regions and environmentally tolerant trees.If you are looking for trees for spring bloom, fall color, or specific size, following the recommendations here will help you select the trees that will thrive in and enhance their setting in your garden."
4,"NAZZ---A beginning for ""Todd Rundgren""","Hey all of you ""Todd Rundgren"" fans...Although Todd, did start in a few other bands, in the Philidelphia area, the ""NAZZ"" was really the best ""start""...As Todd stated ""We were the Beatles, for those who didn't have them""!!!--This album also features a superrendition, of ""Hello It's Me"", not sung by Todd, but played before it was a huge hit for him, in the 70's.It's a dynamic arrangement, that I'm sure you will all love, if you are a fan of Todd..The rest of the songs are also fun, mixture of this and that, showing Todd's new writing capabilities, as well as his outstanding guitar work....!! Enjoy!"
2,Save your money,"I really thought that this group had lots of potential when I first heard the song Breathe some time ago. I was very excited when I saw this latest CD from them and immediately purchased it. When I heard it the first time around I was very iffy. But I thought I would give the group a few more turns in the CD player before I made my decision. Perhaps this would be one of those CDs where if you hear it long enough it'll grow on you. Nope! In all honesty, this CD has been a complete let down. Two stars because they had ONE okay song. Basically I paid all this money for a very expensive coaster."
2,just like all other games,"Okay, I'm not a very good gamer and I have liked that with spyro I could play a game where I did not need help ALL the time. But I just received the game tonight and was so excited I would have a game to play. But once the game got started I was bored with movie plays and then once I finally got past that...I gotta know button combos?...what? I thought the point of spyro was to give some of us a simple thinking game. Where yeah you have to have a stragety to get by and have tons of extra stuff to do. I really did enjoy running around and collecting gems but now to get anything I HAVE to beat up the bad guys...I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who really enjoys the previous spyro games. No matter what you may think of the previous games...this new one is totally different where you actually have to know what button is what on the controller and have to be able to hit serveral button combos to by...this is not the game for me...Help me please...I'm already stuck!!!"
3,Good as a time killer but quite repetitive,The game serves good as a time killer when you have nothing else to do. Its pretty basic and its obviously meant for a young audience. It gets very repetitive as you progress to the game and might make some not want to finish it. The story is pretty basic too. The game is fairly enjoyble when you have nothing to do and I must say that I may have enjoyed more if I had played at a younger age.
4,Glad that a reboot was made,"I was a bit nervous when I bought this game, mainly because it's a new Spyro series. Here's what I thought about the game itself.Good: -Deeper storyline than the old Spyro games.-New moves and breaths.-Sparx speaks normally like he was supposed to.-Potential in the video game market.Bad: -Spyro's charging is difficult to control.-The start of this game is a bit slow and only 30 minutes into the game, it catches up.-You can't skip any cutscenes, but you get used to it.That's it, really."
3,I keep reading but the books seem the same,The author has a strong message. But every book seems the same. More killing and tourture. The hero gets the girl. The Rebels win.And yet I keep reading them?????
5,Truly Inspiring,"This is a truly inspring tale of a family that not only homesteaded in Alaska, but raised a child with Down's Syndrome with little help from anyone else. The Haakensons had 6 other children, but managed to raise them all, including Jim with Down's Syndrome, to be contributing citizens with strong Christian values. The book was written by their daughter, Mary, after Jim died in 2001. This is a book anyone should read, and especially anyone with a Down's child in their family."
1,horoscope stones,the horoscope stones are fine as long as you are going to put them in a drawer.If you want to move them in any way.Such as a purse.the cheap bag they give you to do so will rip open.It is made of cheap cheesecloth and for the price they could afford much nicer.I only kept these because one was a gift.By the way it was embarressing.I kept the other because the cost of returning it outweighed the $19.95.With a $1.00 faux leather bag it would of been worth $14.95 every day.Sorry amazon.
1,Poorly written and self indulgent.,"I am extremely surprised at the reviews I have read of this book (though from many of the reviews, I suspect that Mr. Rafala has enlisted the aid of his friends). I found Wildflower to not only be poorly written, but also quite shallow in its trite pseudo-philosophic ramblings. I would not recommend this book to anyone and am quite pleased that I only lost the one dollar I paid for it at the used book store."
4,knat repellant,"I have previously purchased the Watkins Vanilla rollette to keep in my golf bag to repel knats. Watkins no longer carries it, so I searched and found this product. The rolling ball seemed too tight at first and would not allow product to come out very easily. It has since loosed up some, although it is still not great, but once the vanilla scent does come out, the knats stay away. My husband and son also carry one in their golf bags."
3,It's A Good Starter Piece For Me,The one I got had more facets to it than pictured here. I like the more facets. Appears to be facetted by hand. It's natural chrystal. I'm trying to remember what I heard on Coast to Coast AM talk radio about crystals...how to test it for being positive? Need to change it some to get it to work for me. Wonder if it's too big after reading the other reviews. Smaller would be better for what I would like to use it for.
2,No Vista Support (yet or ever?),"Works great with XP, no problems there, decent transfer speeds over network.This thing has no vista support, there are some individuals that published a few suggestions on how to get it to work, but they are not guaranteed and are NOT for the average user. I am now able to get it to work after about 3 registry key entries, not very easy for people that do not work on computers for a living."
1,worthless waste of time,"this book is a complete waste of time. the entire message of the book is that people in their early twenties either don't know what they want to do with their lives or don't have enough money to do what they really want. if you are or have ever been in your 20s you surely already know this and thus don't need to waste your time reading abou it. the authors offer no insight or advice, life changing or otherwise. the book simply collects the comments of a group of mostly over-privilaged twentysomethings whining about having to deal with the real world.not only is the content of the book disappointing, it is also poorly written. it seems to be written at about a 7th grade level. it wouldn't have taken more than a few hours to read the entire book, yet i found myself skipping large sections due to the book's repetitiveness and the dumbed-down writing style.don't buy it. don't borrow it. don't waste your time."
2,Tells you others are in your shoes - now what??,"This book was recommended by a fellow 20-something recent college graduate who had also just moved all by themself to a new city to start their first job. I got the book, very excited to see what others had to say and hopefully find some suggestions. The book provides some, but when in the situation of a quarter-life crisis, this book was more depressing and was like rubbing salt in the wound, rather than uplifting. It was interesting to see others' stories, but that didn't really make me feel better about my situation."
5,Promise Fulfilled -- a Great Guide to the Wilds of Adulthood,"I had to write in -- I read the earlier reviews before I bought the book and need to lend my voice to those who have already written. The Quarterlife Crisis proclaims to help people with a time of inner turmoil in their lives few know about. It did just that. I don't think I am in my ""quarterlife crisis"" because I worked for a few years after high school, got some direction, then went to college. I'm working now, happy to be a professional. But, this book showed me that my confusion about life/career/family was normal, and that people deal with that problem in different ways. I took time off, waited tables, travelled, and felt guilty for not following the pre=determined highschool to college route.Thanks, Alexandra and Abbey, you have a great book. I'm giving it to my niece this fall before she starts college."
3,"Response to ""GAGfest & Response to MARC's""","Honestly, are you mad? Are you actually mad? What in the name of God do you mean when you talk about the 'all singing all dancing crap of the world'? I think you might just be tripping out. In addition, I find it hard to believe that anyone with more than a single brain cell could actually think that everyone on earth has the same opportunites. Read some statistics, moron. The gap between the rich and the poor, yes, in your country, America, is growing. Not shrinking. Everyone does NOT have the same opportunities, actually."
1,Book reviews posted need serious help,"First of all, American is capitalized. Embarassing. NOT embarEssing. I haven't read the book, but seriously, I would like to hear the opinion of educated people who can spell and punctuate correctly. Also, sounds to me as if you have an awful lot of bitching and whining to do yourself."
3,Half way there...,"By did this book hit home. While it does lack in positive proactive measures, ie what SHOULD you be doing with your life and steps to take to get there. It does sum up what I, and a few other Gen Xer's have been feeling. Let's see, 10 years out of college and over educated and underemployed. No, I did not expect to be handed a job, but I didn't think it would be this rough. Hey, I even got a business degree so I should be well qualified right? Yah sure. A college degree and a buck will get you a cup of coffee. These boomers don't promote you, then you get frustrated, and then they can't figure out what your problem is. Can't wait until they retire."
3,common stories to share,"It is an easy-reading book. The content is talking about the stories of the young adolescents. I belong to this group of people. Some of these stories are the same as my experience. The ""troubles"" are not only happened in US culture. It is also happened in Hong Kong. Some of my friends share similar experiences. However, after reading the stories, I still do not have any solutions or way out of the crisis."
2,Unrealistic,"What bothered me about this book was that none of the 20-somethings seemed to have any real responsibilities. Not all recent grads had their education and expenses paid for them. How many college grads can just quit the job they don't like and go live abroad? That's what it seems everyone in this book did. Didn't they have student loans or ANYTHING that they had to pay for? The truth is that most people have actual bills, in addition to rent and cannot just take off on a whim and move to Australia and Iceland to ""find themselves"". I was really hoping for a better book that actually related to real peoples' problems. It had so much potential. I just wish they interviewed people who weren't spoiled brats."
1,Boring,"As a twentysomething college grad, I am aware of the quarterlife crisis and was looking for insight on combating/minimizing/handling particular problems that come up during this period. This book talks about rich kids and how their life isn't working as planned. Oh I graduated, built a successful career in 3 years while making 100k and now want to quit and travel the globe. Give me a break. I guess there is truth to this entitlement generation talk. The book is now outdated anyway. Many of these whiners would be lucky to even have a job in today's economic climate."
2,A disappointment,"This book is kind of a joke and is of no real use or substance. The quarterlife crisis is not discussed here at all. It is simply attempting to give one permission to whine about such things as a decreased social life after joining the workforce. Welcome to the real world. The book declares that you're not alone if you're feeling lost and uncertain after college. That's fine, but simply declaring it doesn't make it feel any better. The authors had good intentions, but their presentation is lacking severely."
2,Modestly interesting and even less useful,"Having just turned 25 and needing some advice on what the hell to do about it, I picked up this cleverly-titled paperback. Long before the end, though, I realized Quarterlife Crisis coasts by more on its inherently interesting subject matter than anything the authors have to say about it. Throughout all 198 pages it has this anecdotal, unstructured, almost gossipy feel. A recurring theme is for the authors to make a point (usually an obvious one), then spend the next 20 pages circumventing the subject instead of expanding or analyzing, much less providing a solution. There are pockets of insight here and there, but most of the comfort of reading this book ended where it started: knowing my concerns affected others.Consider this a book written for ditzes, by ditzes. Anyone with brains or ambitions in life would need a stronger dose of logic and insight to be satisfied."
5,More insights from Eric,"This is a re-packaging of Eric Holmberg's Unholy Hollywood, since he expanded his outreach from Reel to Real Ministries to The Apologetics Group, where he has partners.In the spirit of Hells Bells."
1,"Barley is gluten, dummy.","Barley IS gluten. This item is NOT gluten free. People with allergies or Celiacs Disease DO NOT EAT THIS PLEASE! It WILL make you sick. Also, this company could get sued for selling things that will make people ill. Claiming your bars are gluten free when they are not is stupid. Don't be dumb. Take this off of the gluten free list."
3,"A quick, fun read, but little substance...","Just finished Hell's Faire... must admit to being a bit dissappointed... the writing is fun... favorite characters from previous installments are all there... but the story just felt cobbled together... the first three books were always gripping... this one was dangerously close to fluff, with the end coming and going so quickly that I ended up staring at the last page for a bit, wondering if I had missed something... all in all I would recommend this series... great stuff... it just just ends on a bit of a down note..."
1,Very disappointing,"After anxiously awaiting this book for months, it was a huge letdown. The story just seem to run out of steam, rather than wrap up the plot lines started in When the Devil Dances. The ending is very rushed and you get the feeling Ringo was more concerned about meeting a publisher deadline (which is also the reason he gives for this really being the end of WTDD, what I don't understand is why not push the pub date back and put out the book you really meant to write?) than really providing enough closure to the series to satisfy readers until he returns to the series.Maybe one day we will get to return to the world and enjoy the characters again when Mr. Ringo decides to give it another shot, but the story and universe he created with the first three books deserved a much more fitting break and/or ending point than this."
3,not as compelling a read as his other books,"as a clinician in the field of forensic psychology, I find most of the doc's books readable and interesting. this one would probably be my least favorite that he has written. the story line just did not check and hook me like some of the others did; ie., Projection, Denial, etc. I would say, if you can get this at a used book price, it would probably be worth the couple of hours it would take to read it."
1,terrible. don't waste the $'s on this one,I downloaded this one to Kindle. Couldn't wait to read it. Could hardly get thru the first chapters. So boring!!!! I wish I could get my money back. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. I never even finished it.
1,meh,"I personally love this show, but I purchased this item on the 1st of April and it is now the 14th of May and have yet to recieve this product."
1,Poor Quality Battery,"Bought this battery September of 2006. Worked great on our first trip. Greatly outlasted the original battery. Took it on a trip March 2007. The battery only gives 1/4 of its original performance. Caused a lot of lost shots on our trip. I noticed the word ""POWER"" was spelled ""POWWER"" on the battery. This would seem to provide a hint to the quality. Too bad. I loved this battery on the first trip."
5,Battery for Canon camera,"I am very pleased with this battery. It held up during hours of shooting at a recent event, which made this photographer very happy."
3,Why can't I listen to this album?!,"I just got into Idlewild earlier this year. I first heard ""Love Steals Us From Loneliness"" and ""A Modern Way of Letting Go"" and I just fell in love with them. So I get both ""Warnings/Promises"" and ""The Remote Part"". I pop ""Warnings/Promises"" in my CD player.....and the damn thing doesn't play. I try my portable CD player, then my car CD player. I haven't tried my pc yet cause I know it still won't work. And I was really looking forward to hearing more of this CD. I am very dissapointed with whomever idea it was to include the damn CD copy protection, because it also works as a CD listen protection. ""Warnings/Promises"" needs to be changed to ""Warnings"". I'm glad I got it from BMG for free and that I also got ""The Remote Part""."
3,3.5 Stars - This one's a grower.,"Ok so at first listen, Yes its slower and Yes the band seems to have gone even more mainstream and matured sounding, but so what. The songs here are as strong if not stronger than any songs they've released before. Its with cd that the subtle beauty of Idlewild's music can really be appreciated. Just listen to ""El Capitan"" or ""Not Just Sometimes but Always."""
4,Pilgrims of the Mind are on my iPod!,"I never heard of Pilgrims of the Mind until one night when I happened to hear ""Something's pulling me under"" on Soma FM Groove Salad, which was playing on my Sonos system (also available on Amazon). I heard this rhythmic piano sound followed by a chill drum track that builds to a really nice sound. Groove Salad doesn't have a DJ to back announce songs so I had to go online to find the track on their playlist. I found out what the song title was and my adventure lead me to the Pilgrims website where I listened to the album online. Next stop, iTunes, which didn't have the album; then to Amazon where I found the album available. I play the album with other House groups when having people over and listen to the album on my iPod. Definitely worth the work to find the album! =)"
5,Great Reading,A true story about the heroism of our buys in combat. Taking Bagdad wasn't as easy as we all thought.
4,"Detailed, but.....","This is a welcome book as it covers a neglected campaign, but the book is marred by an impression of sloppiness. If the publishers had provided better maps they might have realized that often left is used when it should be right, east instead of west, an endless series of misstatements geographically. As the book is a compilation of army and divisional histories, it often ignores actions not covered in its sources, creating many disconcerting gaps. For example the 8th Army storms one river line, then the book goes to a chapter or two on the 5th Army, and when it returns to the 8th Army it has advanced unnoticed twenty or thirty miles further. Sometimes it seems if no one cared: in the final chapter half the footnotes disappeared. It's a good book and worth the price, but you cannot help wishing a little more effort had been made: in the end it must be described as the best we are going to get."
2,not suitable for armband use,"PROS: The case fits the ipod well and the wheel still works. Works well if you wish to primarily use it with the belt clip.CONS: I wasn't thrilled with the notch on the back of the case that is permanately attached. I was hoping that the armband would slip through the back of the case, so that I oculd just pull out the arm band when I wasn't exercising and use at a regular case. Instead the case has a notch that clicks into the beltclip and then belt clip clips onto the armband. This is not a good design for jogging and such. The ipod will flop around and could easily fall off while exercising. I returned it for a refund and bought a Belkin that I am happy with."
1,"Dense, processed, not worth it","I was very disappointed. The photos make it look big, like a cookie. It is tiny, like a small coin purse. Flavor is blach. I can make much better on my own at home with fewer ingredients. This is just an expensive gimmicky food that is still highly processed. Carbs are 17! Bummed I now have 17 more of these and they cost over a $1 a piece."
2,A dissapointment,"I had high hopes for these, especially based on many raving reviews, but I don't like them much. There is a very intense aftertaste, much like the taste you get from some artificially flavored/sweetened whey powders. It's amazing actually that I really love pretty much all the ingredients of this separately, but when they put it together it's pretty bad! They would be really satisfying as a healthy, high-energy snack ... if they just tasted a little/a lot better."
4,Like inviting Kilbey into your living room...or opium den,"Like others have stated, this CD will not convert the masses to the wonders of Steve Kilbey, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kilbey's music, apart from his music with The Church, has never been terribly accessible, but this CD will please the many who are already familiar with him. He takes a very casual approach on this live recording, sometimes off-key, missing notes or taking liberties with the rhythm. This criticism, however, spoils the joy of hearing Kilbey work his way through a unique body of work with that crags-in-velvet voice and a simple acoustic guitar. It's also fun to hear him banter with the onlookers without attitude but with a sense of humor, especially when introducing and playing the first song he ever composed as a child. Steve Kilbey will forever remain on the periphery of pop music, doing his own thing - and so what? He likes it that way and so do his fans."
4,Fine acoustic live album full of Church and solo classics,"Aside from being busted by an undercover cop during the last Church US tour, we haven't heard much from Steve Kilbey until now. This intimate, low key live album captures the charm and power of both Kilbey's songs. The surprise is Under the Milky Way. This version is almost like a deconstruction of the original song (although not too far removed from the acoustic demo released on the Arista single in 1988). The other surprise is the fact that Kilbey actually performs it as it would seem the most obivious track (along with The Unguarded Moment)to avoid.Clearly Kilbey is in a crowd pleasing mood here and he does so in spades. One of his strongest albums (along with the hard to find Unearthed, Slow Craw and Jack Frost CDs) Kilbey has made in recent years and equalled only by the recently released Marty Willson-Piper CD. Now if the band would get their stuff together and release that live Church album they've been promising, I'd be a happy fan."
2,"For ""completists"" only.","This review is for the two B-Sides and the video of 'Nicotine and Gravy' only.Another reviewer's comment that the song 'Midnite Vultures' should have been included on the album of the same name is, as is everything written here, a matter of opinion. In my opinion Beck was right to leave it off the album - it would have been a real low point and out of step with the rest of that release. It plods, is only an average Beck song and it is in no way similar or as good as 'Nicotine and Gravy', 'Pressure Zone' or the equally slow 'Beautiful Way'.The track Zatyricon is the worst thing I have heard Beck put his name to.Which leaves the video - a cut and paste, animation affair that actually detracts from the great track it accompanies."
4,"Good, But Not Perfect","Urinary incontinence, a common symptom of Parkinson's, has been a big problem for my patient at night, but with this product she often can get a good night's sleep. Backing up this diaper with a Stay Dry underpad has added extra protection of the bedding when the diaper has leaked.McKesson StayDry Ultra Underpads, 30""x36"""
2,AJ Truth About Golf,"Helpful for a beginner, but an experienced golfer won't learn a lot from this series."
1,Is this about golf?,"The entire thing focused on one aspect of golf...the impact. Nothing about grip, shoulders, etc. I'm not conviced AJ himself even knows how to golf. Trust me, save your money. Check out Jim Mclean's Eight-step swing if you really want to learn about the ENTIRE golf swing."
1,Save Your Money,"This is a dissapointing set of CD's. Lots of Blah, Blah, Blah, very little meat. Most reviewers and fans of this ""secret"" are High Handicappers that ""started to work in earnest"" on their games about the time they got the tapes. Believe me it was the working on Their game not the ""secret"" that helped. You can go to Golf Magazine Online (October 2006 I believe) and read in 10 minutes what these tapes take hours to tell you. As a matter of fact I will tell you in one sentence what the ""secret"" is. Hit down and through the ball and rotate the clubface with your hands through impact. TaDa!! I just saved you money."
1,Not Armenian,There was nothing Armenian about the music on this CD. It is 100% Arabic and it should not be filed in the Armenian section despite the fact that the musicians are Armenian by name. It might deserve 5 stars but not as Armenian music.
5,Great book!,"This is a wonderful book which I read years ago, and wanted to read again. I bought the audio version to listen to in my car on my daily commute so that I could go back in time for an hour every morning and evening for a few days. Great way to relax!"
4,As the Crow Flies,I enjoyed reading this book. A typical Jeffrey Archer novel with little twists that kept me reading until the satisfactory ending.
4,"As The Crow Flies, It Soars!!","Excellent work by Archer. My second favourite of his novels, next to only Kane & Abel. Story of family, triumph and tragedy. By the end of the novel you'll feel as if you grew up with the Trumper family."
1,Didn't work for our vtech phone,"Even though the jack size is correct for our vtech phone, the sound was garbled and faint -- I had to return it!"
1,"so far, really annoyed and frustrated","it doesn't work, the volume control is a nice button, but it doesn't raise volume enough for me- volume is fuzzy-and so far, my attempt to return it for a working replacement, and/or a refund has, so far, led to tap dancing from seller rather than prompt and acceptable action--- annoyed,very annoyed"
1,Volume Too Low,"Volume is too low, microphone touches my face unless I pull the headphone forward from my ear, flimsy cord, no instructions on what the function of the 2 switches is, one is apparently Mute. Overall very cheap and not as good as Panasonic headsets that cost less."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I've had two of these, both of them had the same issue. Picked up this headset to use with an Xbox 360 controller. It started off pretty solid, but before long it stopped picking up my voice. In order to use it I pretty much have to scream into it. This could be an issue with the controller over the headset, but I haven't had issues with other headsets.Otherwise the inline mute/volume functions were great, clear sound in the earpiece, and it was an incredibly comfortable headset. If I didn't have the mic issue it'd still be my daily driver."
1,the one i received was not a good one,I dont know if i got a defective one or what but i work from home and none of my customers could here me. I tried adjusting my phone but nothing worked. I had to borrow my sisters head set since she had the same job but quit and was not using hers anymore.
2,Nice Headset,"I bought this headset because I work from home and it was the headset recommended from the company. I like it well enough but it could be so much better. I don't like the flimsy wire they used to connect it to the phone! I am afraid that I am going to pull too hard on it and it will break. Also, I have the in-line volume all the way up and the sound is still too low for me. I will update this review after I have used it for a while longer. But I am looking for a different one. I don't recommend this headset."
3,Quality was a low,I bought this because I wanted a wired headset after reading how wireless headsets usually have bad sound quality. This was no better. It felt as if I was talking in a tunnel. The sound quality was poor. Sent it back and am on the hunt for another brand.
2,It's O.K. but get a real readset.,I am a little heard of hearing and I thought this would improve the quality of the sound from my speaker phone. It works but the sound from the speaker is better then from the headset. I'll spend some real bucks next time.
1,bad batch?,"I've just returned my replacement headset. The first one was defective and so was the second one. Turned to the highest setting, the volume is lower than that of a whisper. Frankly, it's insulting to find such crap being marketed. It's a waste of my time to have to package it up and return it. It's a waste of the resources used to manufacture it. And, it's a waste of carbon-based fueled used to ship it here from China. Poor quality and waste like this make me furious!!!"
1,Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volume,Tested this item when i received it and it makes you sound very far away. The ear buds with the mic worked better than this product hooked up to my Blackberry. Might have been the jack that has to be used as the connector was the small pin type. As it sits right now i shoved it in the draw most likely not to be used again.
2,"Nice item, just didn't work for me","I received the item very quickly, but it didn't work for me. The unit was comfortable to wear, but apparently there was a loose connection in the headset. I tried it on all four of my cordless telephones, and you had to hold the plug into the phone to hear anything. If you didn't hold it, the unit would cut in and out, and when it did work, there was a terrible echo in it. Might have just not been compatible with the phone I was using. I tried it with my cell phone also, and had same problem. Just sent it back a week ago, and was notified today that the refund would be credited to my account. Very pleased with customer service, gave it a low rating just because it didn't work for me."
2,Volume is too low!,"It is a nice headset but my main issue is that the volume is just too low. I have tested it with 4 cordless handsets, three from Panasonic and one from Uniden. Even with the volume turned up all the way on all handsets, it is pretty diffcult to hear the other person. The only time it is OK is when the other person is a pretty loud talker.Hence IMHO this headset is not useable.Comfortwise it is OK, pretty light. The mic boom needs to be a little more adjustable, I have had the problem of it touching my face [as the other reviewers have reported here]Also there is no real need for the volume control and the mic mute switch. Both these features are already there on almost all cordless handsets I have used. That little box gets annoying pretty fast. The cord is pretty flimsy. I have a headset at work [from the same brand] its build quality is MUCH better."
2,Cant complain to much for price,headset if fair for price but after some time of daily use the plastic becomes stretched and does not hold on head well. Volume is low so it can be hard to hear if you are in a noisy environment. Worth price paid.
2,Wish people could hear me!,"I purchased the product based on reviews I read. I didn't want a wireless Bluetooth ear piece because some don't fit comfortably in the ear or they sound lousy and I only use them in the car. I can hear everyone clearly and the volume is perfect, but no one on the other side hears me well. They say I sound either garbled or my voice is too low or there is an echo. Basically they struggle to hear me. Can it be my cell phone (LG env3) I don't know? But I am disappointed in the product and wouldn't have purchased it. Now I have to research again and try to find another wired headpiece. I hate throwing out money!"
3,Headset is A-Okay,"We purchased two of these plantronics headsets for use of our cordless phones. We have a Motorola, Sony, and Panosonic cordless phones around the house and the M214C Plantronics headsets works relatively well. Since the headsets are not battery operated volume you hear is never real high, but Plantronics headset seem to have the best volume and a voice clarity in the market.The drawbacks to this model is the over-the-head band is not ajustable and loose for kids. The boom clarity is a little bit tinny, but all words are I speak are understandable.This is the best value headset I have had."
5,Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volume,"For the money you can not beat this headset. I hooked them up right out of the box, went on Teamspeake and was talking to my team mates in a flash.Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable VolumeVery happy with Plantronic products.Just go on and buy them! Can Not go wrong for the price...trust me !"
1,worked for only 2 weeks,This product is good but does not last long. After using it for 2 weeks it stopped working & we needed to return it.
1,Doesn't Last More Than a Few Months,"Very happy with the way this works, good sound, plenty loud enough, but I'm now on my third one. The cord/connections are not robust and something goes wrong where the cable enters the headset resulting in intermittent sound after several months. I really wish it would last longer.Only other complaint is that the mute on/off is not clearly marked, so it can be hard to tell if you forgot to ""unmute"" it from one call to the next.*** Update *** I've decided I'm tired of buying new ones. None of them last more than a few months. I have even used cable ties to take the stress off the cables at the ends. I did this for the last 2 of them and used different approaches to relieve the stress, but they still don't last more than a few months. Given that I've bought a lot of these, I have to conclude they are really poorly made and I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Bad Investment,"I chose this to use with my mobile phone in my home office but it turned out to be incompatible. I checked the specs before ordering, and it said it matched my phone but the plug is too large. I can use it with my landline but considering that I rarely use that phone AND that this headset is really bulky and will not stay in place on my head, it is simply not worth trying. I also have trouble hearing through the ear piece - the volume is supposed to be adjustable with noise reduction technology but it does not function well. I definitely regret this purchase."
2,not for me,"I was very unhappy w/ this headset. It was difficult for me to hear, and difficult for the person w/ whom I was speaking to hear me. I exchanged it for the Plantronics M175 and I am much happier."
2,Not good with our Uniden phones,Crackles and poor reception for the person on the other end of the phone. May just be with this phone; don't know. Ordering a different model now.
4,Plantronics Headset Review 2nd,"This is one of 2 headsets we purchased for our cordless home phones and this is the exact same model we were using which finally gave out a few months ago. It had lasted a little over 2 yrs and with many drops of the phone, etc we felt it did what it was meant to and would be good to replace with same one. Only used 10 times or so at this point but so far so good."
2,Does not amplify enough,Turned up all the way lets you hear like you would if you were not wearing them. I got it to keep my hands free and to be able to turn it up when there was background noise. It does keep my hands free but if I need to hear better it is no help.
1,Not even worth the low price,"Despite no istructions at all, we got the unit to somewhat work. Even after working, both the mic and headphone quality was so poor that it quickly moved to the trash. Don't fall for the low cost. It just dpes not work."
2,Look better than they work,"This Plantronics headset does not fit most phones as it was advertised. I bought two sets. My fault for not looking deeper into the plug size, but the ad that says fits most phones is very deceiving. Mine was the larger size plug. So, rather than return them, I purchased separately the converter. Everyone I talk to says its hard to hear me. I have the talk volume turned all the way up. Functionally, it was exactly what I wanted. If it worked better and had the larger plug I would be very happy. However, I am disappointed."
5,McDermott Masterful Again,"With Zomo the Rabbit : A Trickster Tale from Africa, Gerald McDermott demonstrates again why he is our favorite when it comes to children's books. The tale is clever. The illustrations are spectacular, as always. McDermott's books are the favorites of my 7-year old, who reads them over and over again. My 2-year old also loves them."
2,Decent,"This is book that my mother used when she had ""the talk with my brother and I in the late 90's and it was outdated even then. The illustrartions are a little too old school and the writing is a little boring to hold the intrest of the 3-7 year olds this book is targeted to."
4,Tough Stuff,You have to be careful with this line as it is tuff enough to damage cinder blocksand fencing as well as other decorative stuff in the yard. For wees and tougher stuff around the perimeter of my property though it is great. Best if you have a lighter duty weedeater to do the stuff around the house though.
4,HOT PARANORMAL!GREEK SATYR PAN.........,"THIS WAS A SURPRISINGLY FRESH,SENSUOUS,NEAR EROTIC READ OF A HUMAN WOMAN AND THE SATYR PAN!AN EXHILARATING,PROVOCATIVE AND WHIMSICAL NOVEL WITH COMEDY AND GRIPPING ROMANTIC FANTASY DRAMA.ON THE SURFACE LARISSA DEMMING IS A HAPPILY MARRIED WOMAN.SHE DABBLES IN WATERCOLORS,INDULGES HER HUSBAND,A PREOCCUPIED PROFESSOR, AND WORRIES ABOUT HER ALARMINGLY PRACTICAL CHILDREN.SHE IS INDIFFERENT TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD EXPOSE HER TRUE FEELINGS.THAT IS ,UNTIL A WALK ALONG THE RIVER FRONT NEAR HER MIDWESTERN HOME BRINGS HER FACE TO FACE WITH THE SENSUOUS SATYR PAN.IT IS PAN WHO AT LAST UNLEASHES HER LONG DORMANT SEXUALITY AND FREES HER TO CONFRONT HER SECRET DESIRES AND HER HIDDEN PAST........."
1,If only I could give this game 0 stars,"I don't like being manipulated by computer games.I won't give any specifics away, but let's just say the goal stated in the instructions and in the game's introduction isn't the real goal. And you don't find out what the real goal is until the final scene. That's disappointing, because the stated premise of the game is intriguing, but it never comes to fruition.Also, the puzzles are tough - anyone who says they did all of the puzzles without a walkthrough is either a liar or a genius.The game looks and sounds OK, but the fact that there is norisk factor to your character leaves the story flat and boring. Plus, the character development was choppy and incomplete - you don't know what ends up happening to most of the characters.I definitely do not recommend this game."
4,"Cute game, some difficult sections","I bought this game for my 8 year old daughter, and there are a few sections she has real difficulty getting through; I often hear ""Mommy! I can't do this, please help!"".Otherwise, the graphics are cute & the storyline is awesome."
1,Promotes spanish,"If I wanted my child to learn the language of the barrio, I would purchase some spanish materials.While High Five has activities for the English-speaking child, it also provides English-into-spanish translations.So, because I am absolutely disgusted with the promotion of spanish in the USA (""press one for spanish"", product labels in English and spanish, government publications in English and spanish, et cetera ad nauseum), I have cancelled my child's subscription.Instead, I have purchased learning materials in French, Chinese and Farsi. My child will be multi-lingual - - but I'm refusing to promote the fractionalizing of my own country into englispan."
1,Do not purchase!,I was excited that I found this product and at such a great price. When I recieved the product and starting using it I realized that this was in fact NOT the joico reconstruct conditioner!!! It was apparently an off brand that they pumped into a joico bottle. DO NOT PURCHASE from this supplier!!!
4,Son loves Legos,"My son really enjoys putting Legos together. However, once he is done they just sit there. He does a great job following the instructions (he is 7) and pretty much assembles them by himself. Overall, a very happy purchase."
5,Substantial and well presented,"This book provides up to date coverage of a complex and commonly misunderstood disease. It is easy to read and well organized, yet provides a great deal of detail. Suggestions for action as well as for further inquiry are provided."
4,"Not Bright Eyes, but Something Better.","I dont know why Conor did stay with this band? The lyrics are absolutely amazing. F the corporate world, trying to buy all of us out and put a starbucks on every corner for their(corporations) profit. Advertisment on every corner, getting bombarded with sales promotional tactics, just to get us to buy thier brands. Living in the middle-class I can relate to this album with great consistency.If you HATE Bright Eyes, such as myself, this album is for you. This is raw emotion with great hooks and melodic sounds. If you like Cursive,The Good Life,Hot Water Music,Embrace,Rites of Spring you will love this ablum."
5,Bob Newhart Box-set,This show was awesome... my hats off to the writers & actors! The characters are boldly funny... I forgot how funny this show was!!! - Rick Eager ****
2,"okay, but depressing","I had a depressing feeling after I read this book. It had the requisite HEA but oh the road to get there. Lots and lots of stuff happened in this book--some of it heartbreaking. It had a lot of historical stuff in it which I felt took away from the romance.Long story short--maybe it was the time of day I read this book--maybe it was my mood, but this book didn't impress me, had some stuff in it I didn't like, so, it will go to the used book store.I have read other Hagan Lee books and, for the most part, I have liked them. This one had a little too much angst in it for me."
2,Namastey London DVD,slow in some parts...was under the impression it was more about the son then the fathers struggle between tridition and wester society
3,Light movie,"This is a light hearted movie, that is worth a one time watch. The movie does drag in the end and has the typical wish-washy Bollywood end, but Akshay Kumar carries the movie quite well in the first half. The video and sound quality is excellent as well."
3,Alternate history of Niven's Known Universe,"I enjoyed this story very much. The answers it provides to many of the questions unanswered yet by Larry Niven are indeed covered, but per Mr. Niven's co-author Edward M. Lerner in both Fleet of Worlds and Juggler of Worlds, it is in Juggler of Worlds that will provide true answers about the Outsiders and the Pak. Since Larry Niven is co-author for this later tome, it clearly overrules A Darker Geometry. Accept the novel for it's entertainment, but do not consider it a part of Known Space's history."
1,"A horrible, incomprehensible novel","As I picked this book up off the shelf without prior knowledge to whatever fiction universe it belongs to, I must base my review solely on this book. In other words, other books in the ""Known Space"" series may very well be better, but I couldn't stand ""A Darker Geometry"".The first three or four chapters are intriguing, and kept me reading. I must say I enjoyed the way life in space and the kzinti perspective were handled -- you really got into the minds of the characters for a while. However, incomprehensible nonsense such as the conversations between the ""Outsiders"" added absolutely nothing to the book, and probably took a lot away. Physics and philosophy bogged the story down rather than giving it flight. I barely made it through the book. The ending was also poor.All in all, I think the only people I could recommend this book to are fans of the Known Space novels, or people with lots of free time to try and figure out the philosophical aspects of this book."
3,it soon palls,"Talking to your Mac is one of these gee whiz things that is so neat at first. But this novelty may rapidly pall. You need to be disabused of one thing. The speech recognition on the Mac that this book refers to is far, far from the science fiction depictions of interacting with an intelligent machine.""Yeah sure, I know this"", you might reply. But for many who have never used speech recognition packages, there may well be this subconscious expectation. Let's be clear. The recognition in some products amounts to recognising simple words or phrases that are commands. So instead of using your mouse to popup a menu and pick an item from it, you can the item. Neat, but far from being able to say a complex phrase and have it ""understood""."
1,Poor Quality,"I had this watch for a little more than 3 months and the band broke in a very awkward place. The Seiko name used to mean quality watches but no reputable watch company would sell a watch with a band that breaks in less than 6 months. I have always loved Seiko watches and was very satisfied with their quality. Last year, the band on a Seiko watch that I had for years broke, I chalked that up to old age. But this watch that I ordered in August did not make it through November. I thought that I was getting a good deal but what I got was a dud."
2,PSD220 (230),"I have had a PSD 230 (just like the 220 but with an unusable key change control) for about 3 years and has finally failed to switch on. When I first bought it I had to return it because of random clicking noises on playback. The tempo control is fine although the buttons are miniscule. It is unnecesarily light and small resulting in a pathetic, mono, on-board speaker requiring remote speakers via the headphone socket which is prone to buzzing. The power supply is DC - Why??? with a flimsy connection and the power on button has a slide action and often requires 2 or 3 heart stopping attempts before it switches on. The digital display is hard to read. The skip forward works fine but skip back is rather random. I know Superscope have done better than this in the past and have missed a real opportunity to create a good product."
2,ABC of the Telephone - Central Office Plant,This book covers the infrastructure of a typical central office telephone switch. It is Circa 1976. The telephone company still uses the lead acid storage batteries and large rectifiers to power the system but the electronics principals described in the book are very basic. Metalic rectifiers went out of vogue in the 60's and now very large silicon rectifiers are common. I was interested in study materials that would be usefull in securing a job as a central office technician for the local phone company. This authors books will probably not get me their.
5,Kitchen Makeover Ideas,"If you dream of remodeling your kitchen, don't start until you look at lots and lots of idea books and magazines. There is so much to consider (layout, storage, colors, and more) and this is an expensive project. Many of the examples in this book are the latest in dream kitchens and that will get you thinking.If the budget won't stretch to something as fancy as these, there are other books that might help scale down the concepts, but at least you know what the possibilities are."
1,too small to fit spices on bottom rack,"this piece is too small. many of my spices could not fit on the bottom rack, making it essentially useless. i returned and am now looking for a larger rack"
4,Great! Too bad it arrived cracked.,"Solidly made with strong jars and nice labels. Unfortunately, it arrived with a 3 inch crack around a top corner, despite good packaging."
3,Doesn't fit larger jars,"I had been looking so long for an empty spice rack to put all the jars of spices I already bought, so I was really excited to find this item. The quality is great, however, almost all the spice bottles I have don't fit properly on this rack! They are just a cm too tall to fit on the bottom rack. They can slide in from the side, but you can't take them out from the front due to the lip. The jars are pretty typical sized, all the ones that Whole Foods and Trader Joe's sells have this height issue. Sigh, back to looking for another spice rack."
4,excellent product,I love this new spice rack. Its beautiful and very well crafted. The containers are a nice size and the two different size sifters are great. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is because of the labels. They give blank labels but with no software or information as to what the font or anything is. I am in midst of making my own labels but am having a tough time trying to match the font and print it off. It looks to nice in my kitchen not to have all the labels match. Other than that I coulnt have asked for a better product. Definitely worth the money if you are in the kitchen enough and need to store this many spices!!
5,It's Spicy!,"This spice rack is well made and the best part is that you can decide your own spice selection! Many other spice racks come with ready-filled bottles and you are limited as to what spices are sent. This spice rack comes empty with bottles and labels so that you get to choose your own spices. I may not want a certain spice that is sent to me. Also, just how old are the sent spices exactly? Who knows? This is an excellent product and we have bought several of these, in the 16 bottle variety and the 32 bottle. This will last many years and is well worth every cent! It arrived in great time and was packaged very well. We're very pleased!"
1,"The product is good, however, the service was TERRIBLE.","The product is good, what I needed, good quality. The service, however was just awful. The site promised the shipment within 24 hours. I waited for it for at least 3 weeks. I could have found similar item at a store or on a different site!"
3,No Spice Spice Rack,"The rack is nice, but did not come with any spices. For the cost and looking at the picture, I thought it would come with something."
1,Not 99 44/100% pure anymore.,"I'm returning this soap. The description claims ""The classic 99 44/100% Pure Floating Soap contains no heavy perfumes, creams, or dyes."" This is not true. Procter & Gamble changed the recipe for Ivory soap a few years ago and started adding glycerin. True, this makes the new Ivory soap (called Simply Ivory) softer on the hands but it no longer claims the 99 44/100% pure because of the added glycerin and no longer meets my needs. I'm sorry to see it go. This supplier must take this description and photograph down."
3,"No Accuracy, But Pretty Entertaining","I bought this for my husband, a huge Hank Williams fan, mostly so he could have the fun of telling me about its monstrous factual inaccuracies. However, it doesn't claim to be a documentary, and we both found it surprisingly entertaining, with a better script and acting than you get in many musician biopics of the era. I expected George Hamilton to be the parody of himself I think of him as, but he turns in a solid performance (not including the songs--they're freshly recorded, remarkably, by then-15-year-old Hank Williams Jr.). If you're a Williams fan, it won't hurt your collection, and it's pretty good for the old-movie buff."
1,A very dissapointed customer,"Hi,I have used the Franklin planner software as far back as their Ascend product. I gave up on Plan Plus, as I am still unable to get around the synchronization problems. I have called Franklin tech support numerous times with no answers and no help. It is a real shame when a company of the caliber of Franklin Covey ignores customer complaints and continues to sell this faulty product.If anyone has found a way to use this product with Window's XO and Palm Life drive, please let me know.Bob"
2,Hanson are the best,Hello i just have to say that this book id alright. It gives some False info but thats ok. if you are a loyal hanson fan i suggest that you not buy this book because it has all the basic facts. This is a good book for people who want to find out more about hanson.
1,Deceptive Listing,"First off, I got this because I thought that it would be nice to have the written dialouge of the movies so I wouldn't have to watch all of them everytime I had something in my head.What this seller has this product listed under is VERY deceptive. The picture and description show a movie poster for the cover and states that the item is spiral bound. Both of these are false. ""Book"" has comb edging-which can come apart. Second, the cover is of a piece of fancy typing paper, nothing more. I actually have blanks of this pattern.I have not read the entire thing yet, but I am only on the second page and already noticed glaring ommissions and errors. There are typos and some of the Elvish that is in the movie is not included, nor are some of the actions that are very promient. This is not a true screen play and unless you have the movie memorized and feel like making corrections, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Now You Know,"Chip Walter takes a compelling and thoughtful look at how physiological evolution has led us to the gift of self-awareness, emotion, and the ability to own our existence. A wonderful journey."
5,Great Product!,"I had some surgery and used this cream on the swelling and bruises. It felt cool when it was applied and within a week my brusing was almost invisible. I intend to buy more and use it whenever I get bruised. Since I bruise easily it will be very helpful. Great price, too."
3,Meets expectations,"The Arnicare arnica cream does relieve pain and soothe with a cooling effect, but I tend to have moderate-severe pain daily, so the relief sometimes only lasted as long as a half hour for me before I needed to reapply. For other people who maybe only have mild-moderate pain or just temporary pain, it can be a great and virtually risk-free option."
5,Wing and Shot,This is a fine book that covers all of the issues that will need to be addressed to train a fine gun dog. Mr. Wehle's method is easy on the dog with little stress and discipline. The book even goes into breeding which has brought Wehle such acclaim. This should not be the only book in your library especially if you are an amateur trainer like me but it must be in the library.
1,don't waste your time,"A big, big waste of time. There are far better courses, software, books, teachers than this. Not saying itsa total waste of time, as there are some valid comments made in all of BW's books, particularily relatingto the mental and pyschological aspects of trading. I bought 2 home study courses, attended 2 private tutorialsand read all three books multiple times. Trust me, I wanted this to work so badly BUT, in a nutshell, the'system' and set of techniques are unreliable and fluffy. After 10 years of trying to make sense and make profitI gave up. Don't believe the hype. The moment I threw all of this material in the trash, was the moment I startedon the road to success. Not blaming anybody, I take full responsibility. You really can do better than this."
2,terrible results,"I've had moderate success with Bill William's first ""Trading Chaos"" book; his 2nd book, ""New Trading Dimensions"", forms my core, profitable, trading approach.The approach in this book, OTOH, has consistently lost me money. The key problem is the reverse pyramiding; I invariably get creamed within a bar or two of sizing up. This just happened to me today for the last time; this review is my parting shot on what's been a frustrating toolset for me.The divergent bar is an interesting signal, although the author (Bill's daughter) never really adequately defines the ""angulation"" that is essential for the signal to work consistently. My rule on ""angulation"", as with any pattern, is that if it isn't obvious and screaming at you, it isn't valid. Anyway, I'll continue to use this ""first wise man"" for entries, within certain constraints I won't detail here. But sizing up 5x on wiseman nos #2 and #3, forget it.Just my experience, yours may differ."
2,would not recommend,"I feel that the book was ill researched. Quite a few of the companies edified in the book are now shut down, out of business and some of the company founders are now in jail. also,on page 78 it says that Nutrilite was founded by Wm. Castleberry and Lee Mytinger and on page 182 it says Nutrilite was founded by Carl Rehnborg. The book was copyrighted in 2000 and many of the figures are outdated in 2008."
2,Best of Disco Nights - GQ,This album has 2 hits on it - Disco Nights and Don't stop this feeling. The rest is mediocore at best.
2,I'm glad this was cheap,"Words fail me. Ponderous. Pretentious. Overwrought. No, not ""overwrought."" That's not the right word. Anyway, this collection of adult-pop marvels from the mid-fifties to (I'm guessing) early sixties includes Great American Songbook items, movie tunes, and whatnot. Damone has a fabulous voice, and some of the orchestral backings are outstanding (Percy Faith and Frank De Vol, mainly), but nothing is more painful than arty renditions of pop songs. This stuff isn't Mozart or Schubert. It doesn't deserve the hushed and reverent treatment it receives here.For those who don't fully appreciate the revolution in lyrics wrought by ""Earth Angel"" and ""Book of Love,"" dig (or, better yet, bury) the following sample, from the fourth track: ""The leaves began to fade, like promises we made. How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?"" You've been warned."
5,Great book!,"This is the kind of book for people who likes endings where the author does not tell you everything and you have to struggle and figure out what happened...and somehow you know what happened and makes you anxious and that is the fun of it! This book includes several different stories with a little taste of suspense. I have read this book many times and every time I have to read it at once from beginning to end. If you liked ""100 years of solitude"" of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I'm sure you would like this one. Carlos Fuentes has many other great books, but my other favorite is ""Aura""."
3,little-woman,This game had its goods and bads. The graphics and sounds were awesome. The new melee attacks ruled but this game was a bit too short (unlike the past Spyro games) and not very challenging. Seems like all I did was go around taking out those ugly laughing baboons. Where was the adventure? Ugh! So that's why I only gave it a 3 star rating.
3,bought as gift,"I don't have a clue if it is fun or not, I bought it as a gift and have not heard back from them."
3,better then nothing,"Pro; substantial, strong, generous size.Con; Urine pours out when I change my husband. Days I add a pad 2 at night"
1,FEEDBACK,Excellent bottle reproduction unfortunately the scent is far from origunal which I have. I have returned have returned receipt & have not received refund as of yet.
5,Perfect,"My old young man of 47 is back in college, thats what a job layoff resulted in. I offered to get him a backpack, but being the macho man he is, he wanted the sack. Very sturdy, holds all his books and mini laptop, very happy. He just better stay away from those sorority girls!"
1,Do not buy this bag!!!!,"I purchased this bag to carry a few books and my laptop. I am a grad student and dont carry heavy loads of books and the bag only goes from my vehicle to class. Given the light use and care I have given this bag for only ONE MONTH, the strap ripped. I have only lightly used this bag for a month and it is already unserviceable. DO NOT BUY this product, its not constructed well.IF I COULD RATE THIS; NO STARS I WOULD!!"
1,"Pretty bottles, cheap smell","I use these for decoration, not shampoo/conditioner. Tried once and made my scalp itch. Has a cheap smell and burns a bit."
4,My Review...,"Upclose, this collar looks just like one of those friendship bracelets you used to wear as a child. There's nothing wrong with that.... It adjusts to whatever size you want and removes very easily. My kids take it on and off our kitten at their leisure. It just makes for a simple collar until the kitten's big enough to spend all that money on something more extravagant. Though, it is a bit brighter than the picture."
4,Good Starting Point,"This is a good starting point for someone looking to get into digital photography. Some of the references are now a little outdated, but the core information is still relevant."
1,They have ruined Spyro,I was looking forward to this title as were my children as we have played all the previous Spyros and even kept some still to replay. I have to say we were severly disappointed. They took out all the best parts to spyro. First off it is not really a platformer type game anymore and the puzzles are almost non existant and what few there are you are given instructions on how to make it work. Then there are the waves and waves of endless enemies. almost non stop. Gone as well are the distinctive races for each world. Spyro is no longer a fun family game. What you Now have is a liner fighting game. They even added in wu fighting moves and slowmo when doing certain combos. All in all the charm of the orginal is missing. I highly doubt our family will be buying anymore spyro titles. if you want a good kids game go for spyro enter the dragonfly or A heros tale both were fun.
1,Not like other Spyro Games,"If you are buying for a kid under 10 this is a good game, otherwise don't waste your money. When something is part of a series it should be like the others. This game should not have been called spyro. The most complicated part of this game is the moves you are reqired to learn, but don't actually need for the most part. Not much else to say...not much to the game.Had I known I was buying a game for children, it would have gotten a better review."
2,"Not the best value for me money,","This book has some good activities but was terribly repetitive. I have read a lot of team building and experimental learning books and thought, I must have read this before. Unfortunately it was the book constantly repeating itself. This book has the same sections repeated several times word for word. It was almost as if it was thrown together in a hurry just to meet a deadline. Needless to say, I didn't think it was worth the money."
1,terrible wig,"This wig was all tangled and did not look anything like the picture, wish I could have returned it and found another but there was not enough time. Do not waste the money."
3,Gaming History in the eye of the beholder...,"History in the eye of the beholderThe boot has very useful information for video game collectors and researchers who are looking for information related to mostly Nintendo oriented lore. I stress its for game collectors and researchers vice enthusiasts. Enthusiasts are looking to be entertained as well as informed and this book does very little entertaining. I found my self reading parts of the book over the course of several months. It just wasn't the page-turner that some other visual treats like ""High Score"" were. All in all it was worth 13 bucks, however I liken it too a History book on the 20th Century, with key events missing like World War II! Sega is not even mentioned as a footnote! Phantasy Star, Shining Force and several other important events in Gaming History never even captured the interest of the author, and it painfully shows here. Three Stars."
4,"Go, Go, Go!","As head of a clan founded sheerly for JO, I should give it an astounding review. However, there are minor glitches in game. 1 is that even if you meet the system specs u may not be able to run the game.Another is the vehicles. The jeeps are too weak, and the APCs are too powerful. The Helos are ok, but they blow up if u hit a tree, where as they should slice the tops off the trees.Also, no tunnels? :( They were a standing point for DF:LW and TFD.However, having said that, many people are wrong, you can assault a base on your own or in teams of 2 with only 2 conditions. Either:THE BASE IS DESERTEDorYOUR TEAM HAS SMASHED INTO THE ENEMY FLANK AND DRAWN THEM AWAY.......:P"
3,A little disapointing but OK,"We needed a replacement single control spray pullout faucet in biscuit color. When you search for all those criteria the choices are few. We ordered this Kohler despite several reviews which critisized flow rate. They were right, the inlets are 3/8"" rather than the 1/2"" commonly used. Don't know why, it's easy to reduce flow rate but you can't increase the max rate. The smaller diameter also necessitated changing out the shut off valves in the wall under the sink, behind the garbage disposal which had to be removed of course! Turned out to be a project and a half! But the lower flow is not too bad and is partially compensated by having a well designed spray which is more effective than the unit we replaced which had 1/2"" inlets. It looks great too."
2,Rick's not what he used to be!,"I guess I was thinking back to the seventies when Rick was still good. Here he's just trying to ride the wave of the `Lord of The Rings' popularity...And that ebbed away years ago. The music here is not up to Rick's past standard, nor mine nor anyone else's. I think I'll this one to my local Library."
2,Too modern sounding,"No denying Rick's one talented guy, but I didn't really find that this music fit with the theme. I was hoping more for music in the style of the soundtracks, but this is very ""synthish"" and electronic sounding. These aren't bad songs, just beware if you're looking for that period/dark sound of the soundtracks."
2,Tell me why...,"Tell me why we should buy that collection?I think the first collection: ""Orbital Work"" is quite good because has a lot of songs, some difficult-to-find versions, a good selection and an unreleased track.A collection like ""Work"" is also bought by people who have all Orbital's ablums (like me) and it's a good start for orbital newcomers... but this one is absolutly useless.My suggestion is to start buying ""The Middle of Nowhere"" (imo the best Orbital album), or ""The Altogether"". You can also go for ""Work"" but... orbital's albums are really a musical experience you shouldn't miss."
4,Pretty decent live album,"Well for a great price this was one of my first Overkill albums. Dont be fooled these versions definitly arent 'extended.' (WreckingCrew is only 1:10) But its still a pretty good live album. When Overkill decided to switch record companys they put together some compilations and heres why this thing is in existence. Its got kind of a wierd setlist with classics like Elemination, Hello From the Gutter, and all that but with some oddly picked ones. For instance the worst one on here World of Hurt from I Hear Black. For sound quality I cant complain and the performances are dead one including especially good versions of Coma and Skullkrusher.So if your a hardcore Overkill fan, your gonna have to get this anyway and its nice to have an album without post W.F.O material on it."
4,A very cool book explaining my favorite band...,"Every now and then Alice In Chains puts out new music but I've always wondered why they don't play concerts or make personal appearances. Why is Jerry Cantrell out there on his own? This book puts everything into perspective for me. I found the stories to be informative, humorous and sometimes heartbreaking. Wow! Is heroin abuse that bad? After reading this book I totally understand the phenomenon known as Alice In Chains. I don't have to guess any more about this band after reading this well-written book. It's a journey from the start in 1987 through 2001. Too bad about Layne. I recommend reading this book...if you can handle strong, descriptive stories about rock stars. Four stars definitely. The best music book I've read in a long time."
2,"Poorly written, some interesting details","I always wondered why Mike Starr & AIC parted ways & this book does shed light on the subject along with some intersting details about Mike's past, growing up in Seattle & how he began playing in bands. However, I have read better material from high schoolers. This book was written in a very poor fashion, repeated certain facts/stories over & over & bored us with some really uninteresting details (like interviews with Mike's friends who had nothing to do with AIC) This book is only interesting for the absolute die-hards, but chances are when you're done with this book (after about 45 minutes) you'll have regretted spending money on it."
3,Time Marches On,"I liked the movie, but the guy that was so obsessed with trying to make amends with classmates that he had wronged when he was in school was rediculous. If he would have just said he was sorry and then left it at that, then it would have been ok. But the main reason that I rented it was because of Channing Tatum, I really enjoy his acting. What was even more enjoyable is that he was acting with his real life wife. They still are good together."
2,I was bored with this one :(,"The movie jumped around a lot, the audio was not the best so it made it hard to follow. I just didn't care for it."
2,THIS WASN'T THE PLAN,"The only thing more boring than going to your class reunion is watching someone else's boring class reunion. The film goes from boring bad to uncomfortably stupid. The conversations were real life boring. What we learn is that chicks like guys who can sing or break dance. They dislike obnoxious drunks and ex-girlfriends.We have a cross section of mostly white, fit, largely pretentious crowd get together. The former class bully who kept apologizing to everyone made the movie extremely stupid. I paused the film in the middle to wash my hair...and I am bald. Not worth paying a rental price. Go watch ""The Big Chill"" again or ""Pretty Ugly People"" if you want to see a decent reunion film.Parental Guide: f-bomb. No sex or nudity."
3,Predictable and Boring...,"I got this movie through the Amazon Vine program because it sounded interesting and I'm a fan of Channing Tatum, Justin Long and several of the other characters. The casting was good, as well as the acting, but... The characters were typical stereotypes and the plot dragged. Yeah, it was realistic but too predictable and boring. I kept thinking the story was going in another direction which would have made it more interesting but it didn't happen."
3,"Slow start, overall good.",The first 30 minutes or so dragged on and on for me...but the story-line was plausible...and predictable at the same time. Good movie. Would have rather only paid $1.00 at the redbox.
1,Terrible,I can't figure out how anyone can use this slicer with the adjusting screw right in the middle where you slice. I sent mine back and bought a mandoline slicer at Traget. That one works great. Don't waste your money on this one
3,It grows on you,"Most of the criticism above is deserved, but much of the music shows its charm with time and multiple playings. No big rousing pieces here, listening to this CD is like listening to a series of short percussion compositions, the sort you might hear at a student concert. The biggest, most disappointing failure is in the end credits. In the movie, they run 5:22, including a lovely solo guitar homage to the original Firefly theme. The CD carries 1:37 of uninspired audio wallpaper."
3,A mild Dissapointment to Fans,"The show Firefly was best known for its combination of Western and Sci-Fi. The music was a big part of getting that feel across. The movie however lacked that strong western sound. The opening piece of music when you see Serenity is perfect, but after that they go into techno beats and music that just isn't Serenity. I can't totally blame them as they probably needed a more main stream sound to attract more people, but as a fan it is a real bummer to see some of the soul music get sucked out. The pieces of music aren't bad, they just don't feel like Firefly. Worth the buy, but don't expect pure Firefly sound. If you want Firefly, just await the Firefly Soundtrack that will be coming out sometime next month"
3,Also lacking,"Long story short...the music often wasn't ""pleasent"" as the TV show's was...I felt many tracks made great movie music (for the drama of the scene) but were poor music selection. The SINGLE biggest disappointment was the lack of the end credits instrumental version of the TV's theme song...and my movie theater cut it short both times I saw the movie, so I ran out to buy the CD just to get that ONE song...and it wasn't there! Overall it was an OK CD, but I should have saved my money and seen the film two more times!"
4,Stopping Cancer at its Source,"The book does a good job explaining how cancer starts and what factors are needed to give cancer the boost it needs to inhabit your body at the cellular level. It explains ways to prevent cancer and the simple things we can do to become activists against such a deadly disease. This book seems to be written for an audience of 9th grade, making it very easy to understand."
5,Great cage,Quaker parrot loves this cage. We also have the next size bigger for Timneh African Grey. Shopped for a long time and these are the best quality for the price. This is the first place we'll come back to for new cages. Thank You!
4,ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN...,"In GOD SAVE THE CHILD, our man Spenser - spelled with an S - is hired by the Bartletts - Roger and Margery - to locate their missing son. As the story progresses the disappearance turns into an apparent kidnapping with nasty and sick overtones and even a murder. The story, as usual for a Spenser title is packed to the brim with characters both good and bad full of life, love and emotion.The novel is also significant for long term Spenser fans, as we meet, along with Spenser himself, the delightful and lovely Susan Silverman, who not only does her best to assist Spenser with the case, but as the publishers quote on the back of the book, she might just help to save a detective, as well.We all should be so lucky!In summary, then, GOD SAVE THE CHILD is yet another classic by our favourite crime novelist. We have a happy ending, the bad guys get what's coming to them and Spenser's soul is a little bit closer to finding it's mate."
2,The Spenser Reviews: God Help the Reader,"After a very auspicious start, Spenser stumbles badly in this, the second of the series. Other than meeting Susan Silverman, who is not that much more than Brenda Loring with brains in this book, the story is an unappealing shaggy dog tale of a screwed up kid who may or may not be kidnapped, his goofy dad and his drunken, nymphomaniac mother. The resolution of the story is entirely regrettable. Even Parker must have thought so, because he basically re-did this plot in a masterly fashion in the later classic, ""Early Autummn.""Don't read this as your first Spenser book; start with the first one and skip this one or save it for last. It's definitely not worth your time."
1,This is not a training book,"This book will not give you ideas on how to train for a marathon. Unless you are ready to run 12-14 miles this Saturday for your first long run it is not for you. The training guide show a 12-14 mile Saturday run the first week. Great advice for the beginners Joe.This is a guide for you to fill out your miles as you run them not really a training program. It has very little substance on training and advice that is helpful to anyone getting ready for their first couple marathons.The only good news is I bought it used on Amazon.com for $. If you want it you can have it for free, it will not help you. If you want a running diary to put your miles in their is a new thing called a calendar that you can put them in."
1,worthless Failtrak,"I reviewed for my series 3 exam by purchasing both a home study book from [...] and by purchasing a Passtrak Series 3 book.Passtrak book - is a complete waste of time. The quizzes and tests are merely there to try and trick you. Nearly half the questions use information that is either irrelevant to the test or are there to try and throw you off. I passed the Series 3 test with a score of 91 yet when I took the prep quizzes and tests in the Passtrak book I failed nearly everyone and usually got only half of them correct. If you want to go into the test with doubt and confusion, purchase this book. Otherwise goto [...]"
2,Cheap chop,"It cuts small stuff OK, but many things just get stuck to the blades and in between them too. I am not very pleased with how it works and it is a pain to clean. I will throw it in the kitchen junk drawer and opt for a good sharp knife instead."
1,"Badly dated, not interesting, not fun","This appears to be an old product repackaged as new. There are a series of presentations you access off the DVD. The resolution is low, production quality low, and there is limited interaction and quizzes.I have some expectations that math software will be interactive, fun, and full of quizzes and problem solving. This was not at all what I was looking for to help with math instruction for my child. I would have been better off with math books and worksheets."
4,Excellent Overall Review/Summary for the CCNA,"This is by far the *best* overall concise explanation of the Cisco Objectives for the CCNA I've found. The chapters are very well written, with enough examples for you to clearly understand the objectives. The book aims at covering the objectives for the CCNA in a straightforward, easy to understand format. At this it succeeds brilliantly. Out of all the books I've read self-studying for my CCNA (I come from an MCSE background), this is one of the two best. This book is not meant to be a ""test"" book with many exam questions, but the accompanying CD has a fair amount of questions to test your understanding. I could not give the book five stars because I felt the coverage on subnetting was inadequate. Overall, however this book has covered everything else exceptionally well."
5,Still wonderful after all these years,"I read this book in elementary school and went looking for it again last year as a gift for a niece. Be warned that there's a scene that she found really sad (Minn gets hurt) -- and it made her cry. So maybe it's not for sensitive first-graders. Still, the story is wonderful and little Minn is a great character. There's also a lot of fascinating natural detail. And stunning illustrations. It's a children's book version of a top-notch Nature documentary. ""Nova"" in print, if you will. Also check out Holling Clancy Holling's other books. They're all great, even looking back at them after three decades."
5,How to build a traditional ford hot rod,"Great book, like a sit down visit with Vern Tardel. Highly recommend if you are building a A-V8 hot rod."
1,buttload of bull,"This book isn't worth the paper it is printed on! It has no signification. Quick read, good for putting you to sleep! The only reason you should buy this book is if you have a hard time sleeping. Read this book and after the first 3 pages you will quickly fall asleep from boredom."
5,pollywog52,I purchased this because of one song and found the CD to be wonderful. Kadison's voice is truely a gift to be heard by all
5,Excellent movie,This is an excellent movie! Well acted and true to the book. My kids really liked it and it arrived on time for Christmas.
4,"Stand-alone it's great. Compared to the book, it's lacking.","I've read Jane Eyre multiple times. I've watched every movie version. I knew coming into this movie that I'd compare it. There were lines that were rearranged or missing. Still, I think it was entertaining and I liked the actors."
3,"Good, But Not My Favorite","I enjoyed this adaptation in parts, but through most of it I couldn't help comparing Michael Fassbender to Toby Stephens and Mia Wasikowska to Ruth Wilson. I mean as an overall movie it was quite good, but as a fellow adaptation of the wonderful Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte it pales in comparison. The 2006 version had 4 hours to tell the story of Jane Eyre. If any viewer never watched another adaptation or read the book they would be completely lost....!"
3,Jane Eyre DVD W Mia Wasikowska,"I've read the book ""Jane Eyre"" so many times. I just love the book, but the movie adaptation felt incomplete. I did think the acting was superb, but it didn't make up for what was left out of this movie."
2,"Beautifully filmed, BUT...","This version is beautifully filmed, the actors are wonderful, but you just can't change a classic story this much and leave true fans anything but upset. I saw this version in the theatre last year, and just re-watched it after receiving it for Christmas. I remember being disappointed then, and now remember why. Without going into detail on the liberties taken, I'll just say, there are WAY too many. Which is so disappointing as the actors may be my favorite of the versions I've seen. I don't think I will ever watch it again. I'll stick with the Masterpiece Theatre version of 2006 in which the actors weren't my favorite (though not bad at all), but the story is the truest to the the original that I've seen."
3,Had such high hopes for this one....,"This had all of the right ingredients for a masterpiece (cast, directior, location, big budget), but is just fell flat! The first part of the movie started out well enough, but by half way through, it just started to drag. Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were wonderful as the leads...seperately!! There were absolutely no chemistry or fireworks in their scenes together! The ending scene in which Jane is re-united with Rochester was so abrupt and anti-climatic! I was left with a feeling of ""Is that it?"". My favorite version is the the Masterpiece Classic version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. That version was longer and it put me in a ""swoon"" for all 4 hours!"
2,Very disappointed,"Having read the book multiple times and viewed several of the previous movie versions of this brilliant story, I must admit that there was much lacking in this presentation. There was so little character development as to draw me in to truly empathise with our heroine. Her earlier years at both Gateshead and even more so at Lowood were what shaped her character and ideals. To have the relationship with Helen Burns so lightly touched upon was a shameful neglect of the story. Many other pieces of the story fell flat as well, notable the relationship with St. John and his sisters. Understandably she felt indebted to their kindness, but there was no build up of (family) connection that it made you wonder why she was generous in a financial way when she inherited Mr. Eyre's wealth. Too many sketchy details and too much jumping back and forth in time leave this movie with much to be desired."
1,waste of money for dvd,"Having just watched this new version, and was re-reading the book and just lately saw again the 2005 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, I hate that I spent $20 on this new version. Did not like it at all. It seemed that too many important scene are rushed together, I suppose for the sake of time. There is no no real time spent on the developing of the relationship of Jane and Mr.Rochester. The reviews that I did read, went on and on about how great it was and so much better. But even my husband did not like it."
1,A Waste Of Money,I have read the novel many times and have watched every film version of Jane Eyre. This is the worst of the lot. This is one of the greatest love stories written. And yet this film version shows no emotion. I felt no passion between Jane and Rochester. These actors said their lines with no feeling. And to make matters worse someone changed the ending of the story. Do Not waste any money on this film.
2,Definitely Not the Best Version!,"I've read Bronte's novel a number of times and seen multiple movie versions since I was a young child. This is definitely not the best one out there. So much of the movie is rushed, and the flashback device absolutely does not work with this story. My daughter and I watched it and could barely get through it, we felt it was so muddled. I'd suggest the latest Masterpiece Theater version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson if you really want to see the story in its full beauty."
2,Liked the book better,I read the book several times growing up and loved it. I found this movie version left too much out.
2,NOT THE BEST VERSION,"Since Jane Eyre is one of my favorite love stories, I was very dissappointed with this film. It was rushed, important facts missing and the acting shallow. No comparison to the superb 2006 PBS version starring Toby Stephens and Rita Wilson."
3,Not very memorable,"I have seen many versions of the great novel ""Jane Eyre"" portrayed on the screen. This one, in my opinion, wasn't one of the better efforts. To me, Timothy Dalton will always be Mr. Rochester, and no one can fill his shoes."
1,Not Happy,Not Happy! I purchased this for a Christmas present for my daughter who owns an Apple computer. This game doesn't work on it and I wish that it would have been stated that things needed to be checked out about the computer before I placed the order. Though the computer does not live in my State. Be I would have had more thoughts about ordering it if I would have know about concerns computer wise.My daughter loves Jeopardy but this gift turned out to be a bummer!
1,Won't install on new MacBook,"Upon receiving Jeopardy for Mac, I installed it, and it kept ejecting itself. I followed trouble shooting instructions on Macsoft website. Amazon claims it's not responsible, and the number for Macsoft is always busy. On their email support, it lists basically every mail carrier it won't email through. Bottom line, this game doesn't work for your computer you can't get a refund.Good luck."
3,$51.39 price is only a good deal with the 4 for 2 promo,"Say you bought 4 of the same product or 4 products with the same price, then this extension shelf would be $38.54.Very heavy item.Made in China."
4,Good get together,"Milt Jackson and Monty Alexander always worked well together; the association seemed especially to inspire Alexander. YANO, a 12-bar blues, is a highlight of the CD, with Alexander shining on his solo. The group likes to switch tempos within songs, usually going from slow to medium or up and then back to slow again. They do this effectively on COMPASSION and 3000 MILES, where the quicker middle section is really good. The title track, a weak fusion piece, falters somewhat, but the rest of this CD is very nice."
3,A strange release...,"A strange release from the Quebec singer. After two successful albums came this weird packaged album of old songs, new songs and remixed ones. Not a greatest hits nor a new album... More of a promotional tool, a way to conquer english audiences (since most tracks here are in english). Highlights feature the singles 'Deep Kiss' and 'Heading West', a funky dance cover of Janis Joplin's 'Mercedes Benz' and the always amazing house mix of 'Bye bye mon cowboy' by Shep Pettibone. This 1997 re-release features two extra remixes, making this a more interesting buy but still, 'Heading West' should be one of the last Mitsou albums to get."
5,The Game of Art,"Let's face it, for an artist these days, wouldn't it be great if you could just talk up your work to a gallery dealer while getting points for eating as much wine and cheese possible? Wouldn't it be easier if you were judged on how good your aim was with a paintball gun?The answer is yes.Forget talent, pick a winner and get it over with, the suspense is killing me. Let me get on with my life, if I wasn't meant to be an artist, then good. I've always wanted to try to play poker for a living.This gameshow will answer those questions for a lucky few. I wish there was a home boardgame version, or maybe idol could expand this nationwide.I'm just sad I wasn't in Boston to have my big shot. Next year they will be lining up around the block for tryouts.Damn you Art Showdown."
3,CoinManage 2009 CurrencyManage 2009,"As a novice coin and currency collector I thought that this program was hard to follow. There could have been better instructions but once I played around with it, I finaly figured it out. When you can scan your coin or currency into the program, that's an asset."
1,Surprise!!!,I just installed the coinage software. The very first coin that I started to put in had no information data or even an area to install it under.It was a 1986 Silver Eagle dollar?????????????? What's up with this???????????
2,SOG Specialty Knife TWI-20 Twitch,"Returned the product as the release had a flaw at the very beginning when it was being opened. Felt like the spring release was catching. Purchased the Ken Onion Leek 1660 instead, has a good release and good pocket clip."
4,Decent Knife,"this knife is very sharp, easy to sharpen, and stays sharp for quite some time. however, the knife is a pretty brittle material and should really only be used for EDC tasks like opening letters and boxes. if all youre getting it for is an EDC knife, then i say its great!"
5,Please Release,Just adding my voice to the others pleading for a re-release of the best Christmas album ever! Thanks!
2,One of the discs wouldn't play!,First of all my husband an I love the show so i would give 5 stars to the show however we were very disappointed when we were watching the alias season 4 and got to the last disc an it wouldn't play at all.. Just said error!! Very aggravating when you're TRYING to watch them in order.
1,Doesn't even come CLOSE to previous seasons!!,"I cannot believe that anyone who watched seasons one and two of Alias could rate season four anything higher than 1 star! The biggest draw of Alias in the prior seasons was that each episode solved some mystery and started another. The big plots that continued from week to week always left you wanting more and desperate to see the next episode. In season four, most of the episodes featured villians and story lines that ended with the show and I found myself not much caring about the next week.J.J. has some big shoes to fill with Season five to get back to the star quality that Alias had in prior seasons - and trying to write Jennifer Garner's pregnancy into the show seems like a disaster waiting to happen to me...but I am hoping to be proved wrong!"
2,What Happened?!,"I really loved the season 1 and 2, and was suprised how bad the season 3 was .. I could not believe it was the same creater and writers.. Then, reading all the reviews on the season 4, I was looking forward to watching them, but... what happened??The season 4 is still bad, story line and plots are all over the place, and NO SOUL at all.. I was so disappointed with the season 4 again..."
3,Alias Fan or at least I was...,"For anyone wanting to get Alias season 1 - 3 I say go for it, it really is one of the best TV programs I have ever seen!!!However, I have just finished watching season 4 and I am deeply upset!! I really really love the show, but I really would not recommend season 4...Im not sure what they were thinking but I really thought the show took a turn for the worse... It has gone completely science fiction, and has lost its plot!!The only part I enjoyed in the season, was the last 2 mins, the cliffhanger!Obviously being a fan Im not going to say dont get it, just dont expect anything special!!"
4,edge of your seat fun,"Twisted plot, twisted characters. Sexy good and bad guys. What else do you need? May be the least entertaining of the seasons, but it links 3 & 5 together so it's a must see."
5,Alias DVD series,It came in perfect shape. It was on time and the packaging even looked new. I was perfectly satisfied and the price was the lowest to boot!:)
3,Kasandra,"Not packaged as described, came quickly though. Also guarenteed to play - so I will make sure that it does play. Disappointed there was no mention of it being repackaged with no original artwork though..."
4,Back to basics.,The fourth season of Alias is very much back to the basics. It is very similar to the first season in the regard that pretty much every episode has its own finished story-line.
5,To thine own self be true,"The responsible existence within our environment equates to actually having an environment that one wishes to live in. Billy Proctor's story, or rather, chronicles of his existence (and family, relatives and friends) of off the West Coast of British Columbia, Canada and how it has changed over the last 50 years inspires one to start treating our environment with respect and courtesy.It is a harsh, unforgiving and yet tranquil look upon what has been described as one of the most beautiful and diverse coastlines in the world. Once capable of supporting those who lived upon and around it, and used its bounty with skill. Technology, visitors and a lack of vision have poached upon it, to the brink of extinction of many of its species.To love where you are, the majesty of your surroundings, and witness its potentially irreversible destruction.It is a grand book about a grand place, that may be, shortly, changed forever."
4,Expensive but good so far,I have uses these for barely 2 weeks now. So far so good.They are a little expensive. The material seems to tough and the shape is cut exactly to fit my cars foot well.
4,"Suspense, Romance, and Voodoo","Angela Donahue, a former Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent, left her law enforcement career five years earlier, when an undercover drug operation went dreadfully wrong and she was shot. Now, Angela has recovered and has a successful new career as a tour operator in her home town of historic Savannah. Suddenly, Angela finds herself in the Savannah police station, accused of the murder of the wealthy J.J. Slade, a man she claims she's never met.The storyline develops quickly, as several other suspects in J.J. Slade's murder emerge. Slade's daughter Veronica is a key suspect, as well as a local drug lord who has just gotten out of prison.I enjoyed the inclusion of voodoo in the story. Ms. Jones begins each chapter with an excerpt from a fictional book of voodoo. The eerie voodoo-related happenings really added a lot to the suspense of the story.The resolution of who killed J.J. Slade was very suspenseful. I was guessing ""whodunit"" until the very last page."
5,How Companies Succeed by Collins and Porras,"The book separates core values from the operating practices ofcompanies. Ultimately, the core value system is the determinantof success. It is the driver of success. The author plots theprofits of visionary companies as against non-visionaries. Thevisionaries make over 5 times the profits. The challenge is topreserve the core values and stimulate progress in the industry.The core values involve innovation, integrity, individualism,initiative, personal growth, quality, risk-taking ability andexpanded service. These types of attributes will give a largeinstitution the speed and agility of a small company accordingto the authors.The book is an excellent value for anyone navigating througha large organization or facility in search of a strategicplan or implementation ."
4,The ideas in this book are Built to Last!,"Great book, excellent non conventional ideas to help everyone from the executive to the small business owner. Discusses ways successful companies became that way, not by using the ""kill instinct"" to make profits at all costs, but by thinking about the products and services they provide and how they will enrich and improve their customers' lives."
5,Excellent Bibliography,Excellent learning materials; surpased expectations; great book to be listened while driving.Great choice to learn.Really recommended for learning!
4,Staying on Top,"Built to Last weaves the seeming contradictions of the need to have an 'unchanging' core ideology with the compulsions of making 'progress' into a cohesive strategy that have been applied by organizations for over a century in their quest for enduring greatness. You learn that dogged determination is just as important as trying as many things, having a cult-like culture is as critical as relying on building a strong management and articulating an audacious goal is as compelling as the organization's focus on clock building (as opposed to time-telling).I would recommend reading this book after Good to Great."
4,The most dog-eared book I own...,"Grandmaster Foonberg is at the top of the law practice ""how to"" food chain with How to Start and Build a Law Practice. Frankly, I own not the millenium model but the Third Edition (it was a little weak on the technology side), but the lessons taught by the mythical Foonberg are invaluable - foremost among them: ""it's better not to do the work and not get paid than to do the work and not get paid."" Just too much here to miss, all put together in small vignette-style chapters. Lots of substance. A MUST have for lawyers. Get it!"
3,Poor Sound Quality,"I am a big fan of Dave Grusin, and I orginally purchased ""Mountain Dance"" on cassette. When I later purchased this music on CD, I found I really had to crank up the volume to hear it. Maybe some mistakes were made in recording but the sound was quite poor."
5,Best SPECIAL INTERVIEW,It's worth watching the special interview with the director of the first version. Unbelievable difficulties in marketing. Really interesting features.
5,Raptor is a great book,"I have used several of the games in the book. I especially enjoyed the game 'Raptor'. I believe I will have many, many more uses for the games in this book. If you want to check me out, look on page 159 for me doing the McAbee move. I can also perform it on any hot chicks!!"
3,desrtuction derby ps1,Game arrived as described (new) - good price .Can't rate the game as I didnt play it - was purchased as a gift for someone who collects old (retro) ps1 games .
5,Alison's Zinnia,"Alison's Zinnia is a wonderful ""ABC"" book that not only teaches the alphabet, but introduces the reader/listener to names of people and flowers. The art is beautiful and illustrates the text richly and accurately."
1,awful crash prone program,"I have been working on computers since 1975. I have seen some awful programs, including some that I have written. This is the single most crash prone piece of software I have ever had the misfortune to use. No mater what you do, it WILL crash. It WILL corrupt HOURS of work and leave you with no option but to delete the file and start over again.USE ANYTHING BUT THIS SOFTWARE"
1,Crashes my computer,"I have a very nice computer (3.2 intell, 1000mb ram, NVida 6600gt, XP Pro) that has been running great lately, including video games like Doom 3. I have yet to have a crash since my last reinstall 6 months ago. This program locks my computer up after only using it for 30 minutes. It won't swith between the different views. Stay away from this product or any other this company makes. Its a waste of time & money. I'm so mad it made me write my first review!"
1,The worst dub in history. I couldn't put 0).,"Well whatever the reason let me tell you my opinon of ""Cardcaptors."" First off it's a show first aired in Japan in '98 under the title of Cardcaptor Sakura. It was a show about a girl named Sakura Kinomoto. It had 73 wonderfull epi. Cardcaptors started with the episode when Shaolan Li(Li's the Family name you don't switch rich, powerful, influental peoples name). Oh I wish i could continue but I got to go so in total Buy the show about Friendship,love,trying your best,stop the world from dying. Get Cardcaptor Sakura(don't pay attention to the 13 &up they never even reviewed it). Even if your not sure cause it's 13& up watch it them you won't be disappointed."
4,Think like a kid,"Since more than half of these reviews have been slashing at the dubbing, I will focus on the storyline.EPISODES:*Sakura's Rival: This is when she meets Li.*Time and Again: One of my favorites, about the Time card*The Cave: Once again, an excellent episode.I started watching Cardcaptors when I was 8. Now 13, I remember with fond memory all of the wonderful episodes and storyline. I have also recently started on the manga.I think that many reviewers need to think like a kid. I LOVED this show. I didn't care about the music, the relationships, or anything. It had such an excellent storyline, not at all like Pokemon. (How are they alike??)This is not an adult anime, this is a kid's anime, so think like a kid, please.The only thing that upset me was the name change/ wrong pronunciation.In finality, please buy this anime before it is forgotten forever. If KidsWB re-aired this show, I would record every episode. Thank you."
2,"Good For A Child's Show, Not For An Anime Show","Well, I am a huge anime fan. Also, I am a huge fan of Cardcaptor Sakura. Though, let me make it clear, I am not a fan of Cardcaptors. This show is an insult to CLAMP (the 4 women who created the original)! Many changes such as needless cuts, name changes, many dialouge changes, and mixed episode orders make this show incompetent. After all of that it would still be decent but they did two things that changed it for the worse. BAAAD voice acting and trying to make Saoyran another main character so it would appeal to boys! He is not, as the 12-year-old reviewer stated, Sakura's partner. He is a supporting character. They also made dialouge changes to make him sound stronger and gruffer but instead they made him a bully. Not to mention they cut out his harmless crush on Sakura's bro. BOTTEM LINE: Not bad for a kid's show but otaku need not apply. Get the subbed under the title, ""Cardcaptor Sakura."""
5,to be that guy...,"Who collects all the crap, did I really need this? Am I glad I have it? Not really."
2,So far - a major dissappointment,"I had high hopes when I ordered the DVD version of Britannica. I expected a huge array of easy to access information, backed up with powerful images and sound.Apart from the fact that I find the site information extremely poorly laid out and not as logical as Encarta to access, it doesn't even impress with it's depth.But most of all - I just hate the way that you have to PAY to get someone on the telephone, simply to help to get the stupid disc to work. One of the key tabs (""analyst"") is bringing up a strange, incomprehensable message. It would be nice to get it resolved with a good old-fashioned customer service rep.I wouldn't bother, if I were you...."
2,Don't buy it. It's an Edsel.,"When you buy the Encyclopedia Britannica DVD, your anticipation is that it's a Rolls Royce. It's not; it's an Edsel. Not only does it have non-resizable windows, its level of technical detail stops at about a college sophomore level. This is adequate for a high school student, but I expected a much higher level of erudition from this DVD. After all, it's Britannica."
4,great old cd player,this is a great basic cd player for anyone. especially works well for older people who dont want to fuss with all the buttons or gadgets on an ipod.
1,Junk...do not buy,"Broke after 2 weeks, I guess you get what you pay for. Amazon makes it. Difficult to return if you do not have the original packaging.Who keeps original packing for 2 weeks..."
2,return,"I returned this item Dec. 2011 because it would only work with the batteries for one cd, then I would have to change them. I sent it back and have not seen a refund yet... how do I find out about this. It has been weeks."
3,The Michel Thomas system works but....,"it works but the male student is too annoying to get around. You remember when you were in school and there was always one student in your class that couldn't understand the simplest commands and couldn't remember from one class to the next and you really, really wanted to get up from your desk and hit that student over the head with your textbook? that's this guy, trust me."
3,"Good method, poor pronunciation","This set is good for an initial introduction to how conversational Spanish works by creating sentences on the fly. Very minor grammar and vocabulary are introduced as well as tips on sentence structure and pronunciation. However, the downside is that the pronunciation is often terrible even from the instructor. Once he says ""quieren"" when he meant ""quiere."" He gets the vowels sounds off sometimes like when he says urgente as orgente. He doesn't roll his r's consistently. The price is fair for an introduction to the language, but for serious students, I recommend something by native speakers. The male student grates on my nerves. I teach ESL, and the method we use is the Multi-track Attack. Students use anything and everything in the target language because even with the cons, there are always a few pros that help one learn the language. The same can be said for this set. Good luck in your language study."
2,Thrills? Well...,"The story was origional, I'll admit, but to stretched out. The story begins centered around Batgirl and Detective Bruce Wayne, but it stretches to almost every corner of Gotham, and even incorporates Black Canary in the '62 thread.Two many threads don't go anywhere, and though some provide great dramatic moments, they are watered down by the point that they have no function.Neat new origens for Batman, Batgirl, Black Canary, Mr. Freeze, and Killer Croc, but the Joker aka Bianca Steeplechase aka Blache Gregory could have been fleshed out, as well as the TwoFace thug and Harley Quinn, which is a horrible attempt to add in more drama to the climax.The characters aren't likeable, and the cleavage is laid on a bit thick for 1961/1962. Not very time-themed, and a bit forced.Read for the new takes on costumes and origens."
2,"Techncally well written, but lacking","I have to admit straight off, that I've never fully liked Howard Chaykin's writing, and I think Dan Brereton is one of the worst artists in the business. For me this story was technically perfectly well written, but it never really drew me in. There were a few little surprises in the story, but I found the characters dislikable and the artwork atrocious"
5,Love it!,"I've been shaving legs and underarms for a couple of lifetimes now, it seems. Can't use depilatories and not interested in waxing (too many stories about people losing all the skin along with the hair from their armpits). Mostly I've used soap lather to ease the slide of the razor because the foams and gels were expensive and really not superior to soap. I had used some other Kiss My Face products so I tried the shave lotion and I will never use anything else. A bottle lasts a long time, the smell is heavenly and I get a fabulously comfortable and close shave. I've converted my husband (he likes the lime scent) and my daughter (vanilla) as well - but I'll keep the lavender."
5,baseboard heaters,"So glad I did this, no more ugly heaters and they work so much better than the old, dirty, dented heaters. Great product !!!"
3,Tiny,It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be...very few things will fit in it. Forget putting a small water bottle in there. I'm still figuring out what to do with it.
2,For $120.00 I expected more!,"Same problem as everyone else for me. No scrolling really can get annoying and if you have a large artist list and you want someone like mariah carey who is in the middle of the alphabet you have to take about 30 seconds before you get to her name. i also thought that you would be able to use the ipod if you wanted, but it doesn't respond.On the plus side however it gives the cd quality sound that i couldn't even come close to with the fm transmitter."
1,ugh!,"got this installed today along w/ the pioneer deh-p58000mp head unit at best buy...plugged in the ipod, check mark shows up on the screen, and....nothing...i can't even control it on the head unit...sometimes, if i'm very lucky, the check mark screen doesn't come on for 30 seconds or so and the ipod actually plays (it's at the normal ipod screen), then once the check mark screen comes on, complete silence...i have a 3g 10gb ipod and as far as i should know, it should work...the head unit is also annoying b/c if you put the mp3 cd on random and want to skip songs, it unrandomizes & plays the song right after it...so if you're like me and you skip songs a lot and like to set it on random, it doesn't work...i think i'm returning both tomorrow..."
3,Christianity,"Since Biblical Christianity is the most powerful force for good that the world has ever seen, it is certain to be counterfeited. This little book contains information on things like: Why is the world such a mess?, Why don't I feel anything?, and What is prophecy?"
5,Great addition to patio,"I installed these chimes in a public area and constantly get comments about how much they have added to the environment. With the ability to add complimenting chimes, this has been a great investment and we plan to install both larger and smaller chimes to compliment these."
2,Lot of average stories,"This collection has lot of average stories. Deaver promises a lot ,but delivers nothing. Especially the one where sherlock holmes and Watson are made fun with. He does not have any rights to demarcate one of the greates detectives of all time. Poor work Deaver. Go for Jeffrey Archer instead, you wont be dissapointed."
3,It's too pricy but...eh...,"This thing serves it's purpose as a component video switcher, however the same unfortunately cant be said about audio.I am a very avid gamer. I needed to buy this when I got all 3 current generation consoles. It seems to render video signals flawlessly, but audio seems to be a little choppy at times. In particular, when there is a lot of loud yelling or singing going on. Most of the time it isn't too noticeable, but when you play a game like Rock Band where sound is of the utmost importance, it can be quite the let down. I started using my old composite system switcher for sound and this for video that way I can get the best of both but I shouldn't need to use 2 system switchers because the more expensive of the 2 doesn't work as well.Overall, I would recommend buying a different system switcher over this. Something that's 50 bucks should work perfectly on all fronts."
2,Problem with TOSLINK,"This device generally works except for one major problem. I am using it to switch between my U-Verse cable box and my Roku box. I use the optical audio for all devices. Frequently, if I have been using the Roku box and then switch back to the U-Verse, the audio goes away. After messing with it for a while, I discovered that the only way to restore the U-Verse audio is to unplug its TOS cable from the back of the 3play and then plug it back in.Do I just have a defective unit, is this a known problem, or is there a solution?"
5,Works well...,"I replaced a cheap passive switch from Wal-Mart with this one. It works very well, no video quality issues. I now have an original XBOX, 360 and a Wii into a single component input on my TV. I haven't tried the remote and probably won't use it."
1,Optical output does not work,The component input/output all work fine.The optical output does not send the signal and is faulty.I bought this in the states to take home/ australia and it doesnt work. what a bloody waste.AVOID.
5,Great device,I have a 10' HD projector and Blu ray video with a 7.1 sound system. This works without any distortion in my opinion. Has a remote as well. I thought about buying a spare in case I ever needed it.
1,stupid HD av cables,yea so like i'm sure the product would work if i had HD components but my problem was i bought it for my hd tv that only has one regular av input and like 3 HD inputs so i needed 2 or 3 devices with regular plugs( 1 plug for video 2 for audio ) so now it sits all silly looking on my entertainment center while i wait for the correct type of a/v switcher to show up
4,Don't be mislead by the low price,"So I've been running out of component inputs on my Pioneer RPTV and started looking for a component video switch. I looked at ones from Zektor, Audio Authority and Key Digital... all were a tad expensive. Saw the Cables To Go model on Amazon and read the reviews... I thought $50, what the hell, I'll give it a try. Well it certainly works as advertised. I didn't notice any visible difference between direct connect and using this box. I'm feeding in an xbox 360 and a PC... works great. Auto-switching inputs would be nice, but for the price I can live without that. The remote doesn't have the distance I'd like either. All in all, well worth it."
2,"""Iffy"" remote function","This component video switch comes with a remote the size of an extra thick credit card. Unfortunately, the remote control function works only intermittently. The switch works fine otherwise. The remote response problem seems to be with the switch itself, since it continues even when I use a universal remote which has ""learned"" the functions of the 3-Play's remote."
4,works fine,The item was delivered timely and works fine. No batteries needed! It has a led that shines in the back and illuminates the wall behind. Some users may find this a problem. It has to be powered on in order to switch.
2,Works About One Third of The Time,"It really depends on the power-up order, whether this switcher responds to commands. Sometimes, it won't even respond to the physical buttons on its face, let alone the remote control, necessitating a ""hard reboot"" -pulling the power cord- before it responds.Not a high-quality circuit board, I fear."
4,Good - but get it on sale,"The good:A.I: Even though somewhat scripted, is the best seen in FPSs. Enemies can react in realtime to your movements, and your shots/flashlight. Enemies will also use the environment: knocking over tables or jumping through windows for cover.FX: Bullet hits, sparks off of metal are capable even in medium-power computers.The bad:There's nothing original here.The plot takes heavily from stories like 'The Ring', so the ""psychic-murdering 8yr-old girl"" is no longer as shocking. The entire game is set inside office buildings, so the maps are repetitive, and very little logic or strategy is needed.I give fun rating a 3, due to repetitition and unoriginality. I give 4 starts overall because there is good potential for modding."
2,Way Overhyped.,"I bought this game after trying the demo, thinking the demo was a sneak peek at what would be an even better final commercial product. What I didn't realize was that nearly everything in the commercial product was already seen in the demo. The same bland environments (3 total) The same enemy (nothing but guys in black body armor) No real in-game plot. No puzzles, no non-weapon equipment. Very little suspense. As soon as I saw a flashlight that needed recharging every 15 seconds, the lack of friendly fire (shoot at an ally and the bullets don't hit them), and gratuitous use of explicit foul language and blood, I knew what I was in for, because those are all things a company throws in when a game isn't well-rounded enough. The enemy AI and physical performance were interesting, but that's mainly all this game has to offer. And for a game that demands cutting edge hardware, the graphics still are bland, repetetive, and overall disinteresting. I wish I had waited for the Bargain Bin."
