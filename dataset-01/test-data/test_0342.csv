2,Poor examples.,"This book is poor at showing examples with complete explanations. They skip too many steps in the process and leave you wondering how they got to the final answer. I don't have experience with other books on this topic, but I would assume that there are better ones out there."
2,disappointing,"i know about the predictament that chris is in and i know that the band is only called the Meat Puppets because they owe more records under the name Meat Puppets but if you choose to call your band the Meat Puppets i am automatically going to compare your band to that band. Curt makes good songs but there is something missing. All of the songs half-suck. maybe if they called their band the ... i would have judged this album differently. i have to say that this album is better than forbidden places, though. i gave this album three stars for trying to be a normal Meat Puppets album. it is not a total departure from the usual Meat Puppets' punk music for fans of the Grateful Dead mission statement but it is half of one."
3,Okay quality.,"Songs are of mixed quality, fans will enjoy but not the high quality we've become accustomed to in CD's."
3,Good Chong content ! No man Dave's not here!,"Loved Chong since childhood and Basketball Jones !He's AWESOME on that 70's show too. THis is a great addition to your Cheech and CHong collection, and Cheech even does a small appearance in this one. BUt you still hope through the movie, it will be good ole Cheech and Chong together again for at least one last time. I certainly hope someone soon say Urine Luck dude! Cheech and Chong reunion movie coming soon ! PLEASE !!!!!!Mr Lizard want a hamburgah !!!"
2,Glad I'm finished!,"I have never been so glad to finish a book. Boyles begins with a gripping narrative of a woman whose identity has been stolen. The image of an innocent, educated and disabled woman huddled on the floor of a prison cell will stay with me a long time. But the book lost its effectiveness for me 1/2 the way through even though I did complete it. Boyle's writing is hard to follow at times, and he definitely propelled my dictionary use as he employed some rather obscure semantics in his prose.The ending to the book was a huge disappointment, and if a sequel is written I won't waste any time reading it.This is my first Boyle book, and unfortunately I have purchased 2 additional works of his. I guess I will read them......but this was enough torture to last me a while."
3,READ DROP CITY,"I fell in love with T.C. Boyle's ""Drop City"", so I have huge respect. He is a fabulous storyteller.I enjoyed the original storyline of ""Talk Talk"", and learned a lot about a few things.It was worth the read."
2,Needs better talk talk,"Character is destiny, 'tis said, so who needs a plot? Here we don't have one nor do we have fully developed characters.Firstly, just how does the villan get away with his scams? Nextly, why is the deaf woman attracted to a toon-graphic nerd who loves music? And what does he see in her? She's too angry to be sexy.How convenient they lose their jobs in time to chase the bad guy and how odd they have no idea what to do when they catch him.By the time their affair fizzles out, this reader was very happy to close the book. Plenty of fancy food but not enough meat on the story. Suspend my disbelief, please!"
2,"Poor quality, poor fit.","If you think that by spending a little more money will get you better quality you're wrong. The worst of which being the adjusters, out of the box the adjusting screws were almost frozen in the plastic retainers causing their poor quality to strip out almost immediately. I was using Snap-On screwdrivers so tool quality was of no concern. I spent almost 2 hours just trying to get them to fit decently around the headlight doors and alignment was still an issue. If the headlights weren't so difficult to remove and my factory ones in such poor quality I would have sent them back ASAP. Save your money if you want this style of headlight and go with the cheaper ones found on other sites."
5,A Superb Resource for Kids and More,"This book is awesome. It is full of very interesting information about why things around us are the way they are. It has a section on the human body, one on animals, one on the earth itself, among others.It is written with humor and wit. I learn (and laugh) a lot as I read to my child. It is so useful for him, too, satisfying his ingenious curiosity that is so precious of children. This is the BEST children's book I have come across so far and very highly recommend it."
5,Great introduction to literature for older kids,"Yes, my children have loved Jim Weiss stories since my then-7 year old son listened to ""The Three Musketeers"" until he could recite large portions by heart, but now I use Weiss to introduce literature to my junior high students. They uniformly hated ""Rip Van Winkle"" in the textbook, so I had them listen to Weiss' rendition. They were hooked, especially after Weiss' hysterical voice as Rip's wife, and much more excited about moving on to more American writers. Irving's original language is tough, and Weiss makes it accessible, as he does the myths, his wonderful Sherlock Holmes' stories and especially the Shakespeare stories (so wish he had more of those). (BTW, ""Rip's Rap"" at the end is a deal-killer for too-cool teenagers, but if you hit the ""stop"" button fast enough, no harm's done.)"
5,Stoked,"these guys are great. Good sound, definitely have a NY flavor. I plan to buy more of these guy's work!"
5,So close it's scary...,I poignant satire on the ineffective bureaucratic intricacies of the Army. I witnessed stuff like this a lot. The movie really helped be adjust my view point.
5,funny movie,"good movie to see, especially if you know anything about the DoD. somewhat realistic unfortunately but still very funny. buy it!"
4,Pentagon Wars,"This is a very funny film which shows the mockery of how certain personnel in government departments throw taxpayers money away on frivolous projects just so that they can outwardly justify their jobs and future prospects. Kelsey Grammer, a highly ranked officer in the armed forces working at the Pentagon, does a excellent job in keeping a very though provoking and eye opening subject at a sidesplittingly humorous level."
4,Sad but true,"Watch out America, here comes the Pentagon. True story of one man's fight (Cary Elwes)portraying a loyal and efficient Lt Colonel of the Air Force against the hard driving antics of a Major General of the Army (Kelsey Grammar). The poor Colonel trying desperately to stop the production of the Bradley Fighting vehicle before it went into production. The saga is lighthearted with both comedic as well as the stark reality of men as expendable. This story is true; sorry to say that the ambition of some against the safety of the men who would be in the Bradley. The frying of sheep to prove that a direct hit would kill all those inside blunted by those who will stop at nothing to conceal the truth behind the tests. You find yourself shaking your head in disbelief. That this could happen is comical yet tragic. Kelsey Grammar is excellent in this role and you will find yourself cheering for the underdog Cary Elwes. A must see for those who want the truth."
5,The Way it is in Disney land East,A very funny but at the same time sad film about the Pentagon's major mission in life- Weopons procurement. And you thought it was protecting the Republic? Silly Child!
3,Army Men,"It is a fun game to play. It was very creative using the different areas of the kitchen and home as battle ground for the game.The stroy line is simple and entertaining. This is not a game that I would play over and over again. This is a good game for a pre-teen, or child to play. They still get too shoot something without having to view any graphic violence."
5,Great dollhouse,My three year old daughter really loves this dollhouse. It is easy to assemble and there are a lot of options available for furniture. She plays with it every day.
5,Love it!,"Like some others said, I love this dollhouse and even I like playing with it with my daughter! It's the dollhouse I always wanted as a child! My biggest complaint is the space you have to fit the furniture in, not compatible but we make it work and it's a great house. Some of the accessories I just didn't get, the flower boxes and flowers fall apart so we didn't put those on, the awnings looked cheap and flimsy so we left those off too. The curtain rod will NOT stay on for anything so we're going to super glue it as with the window cushion. But overall it's a great house!"
4,I want to play too,"I think I want to play with this more than my daugher. I love the fact that it lacks the ""bells & whistles"" of other toys. My daugher talks with the dolls and makes up some pretty inventive stories. I like to see her imagination at work!"
5,my 3 yr old love it,"got it for my daughter's 3rd bday, she plays with it for hours...comes with plenty of stuff, you don't need more...great toy!"
4,Not like earlier version,"Just wanted to let folks know that an earlier review is right; these sheets aren't as thick as the ones from about 10 years ago. I know because I still have some of the old ones! I don't agree that it's half the thickness of the earlier version 'cause I suspect one would need a microscope to accurately figure that one out. I would have preferred the same thickness as the older version, but since I don't plan on trying to rip a double-sided laminated item in two, it'll probably be OK. My main concern is that it will still be as waterproof; which is probably due more to the adhesive and the size of the border, not the plastic itself."
3,CREAMY,"its a great book dont get me wrong, i know from seeing a display copy at a bookstore (remember those?). but how can anyone take it apon themselves to sever the air pack pillow it comes in? rite now its sitting on my bookshelf almost reminiscent of a conceptual little sculpture itself. Phaidon should of figured out a way to reseal the book within the packaging. If not you lose a lot of what you're paying for."
3,"Does the job, but ...","This is an attractive rolling briefcase with some flaws. There's no way to adjust the extendible handle to your height. I'm 5'5"" and it's too long for me to comfortably pull, so I find I hold on to the side of the handle; otherwise, it drags too far behind me and impedes the people following me. It also weighs eight pounds before even putting a laptop and folders, papers, etc. into it, making it quite hefty to lug up and down subway steps. Although I specifically looked for a vertical briefcase, its bulk makes me realize I would have been better off with a padded rolling backpack. It does, though, accommodate my 15"" laptop, as well as my 17"" if it's put in the taller section, and not in the bolstered section for 15"" laptops."
2,Love and Logic for Toddlers,This cassette seems mostly to reiterate the strategies in the Parenting with Love and Logic book. It gave minimum strategies and often made fun of common parenting mistakes. This cassette could be quite insulting if you have a difficult toddler.
5,Jamestowne Ancestors 1607-1699,"Just the book I need to find my ancestors, and I did John Buckner and Mordecai Cooke.This will help me with my JamestowneIt's has been up date"
4,"Well, it cooks eggs.","Does it poach eggs? Yes. Do the eggs stick? Yes, even with the cups well oiled. But anyone who has ever used stainless steel knows that sticking is usually an issue with stainless. I like this product, but compared to the stainless poaching set that I inherited, it's not anywhere near as sturdy. I expect that it will hold up just fine, but don't think it's going to become an heirloom. The plastic handles on the cups get HOT and cannot be used in a practical way. Given the other choices on the market however, I would certainly buy this one again."
4,great for role play - have a child w/ autism,I am always looking for ways to 'reach' my boy who has autism. These will help with role playing social situations.
4,Recommeded,"Well written. Gives very good theoretical resources to the profession. Speaks very well to someone like me, a former therapist who is interested in Life Coaching. Some of the income expectations/potential do seem a bit unrealistic, but still something I am pursuing."
1,Half the songs are exactly the same!,I don't know why I payed ten dollars for this album. Maybe five dollars would have been justifiable? There are very few decent tracks on the entire cd and almost all of them are just slight variations of each other. Half of the songs feel like my ears are being raped.
5,Perfectly crafted disintigration,"This music is absolutely enchanting, and masterfully portrays the slow and steady collapse from the movie. Starts with faint sounds of hope, but things slowly fall apart until, by the winter, the devastation is audible and absolute. I absolutely encourage everyone to see the movie and get the soundtrack."
2,Who sang the original Homies song???,"If anyone knows who sang the original please email their name to me. That song deserved a 10, this one is a 2."
2,Not able to play on DVD,I was disapointed as you are Not able to play this on a DVD player. You can only play it on a computer. :-(
5,ONE OF A KIND MOVIE,This movie is very unique. It is the only movie that I can think of that sticks two of the greats from the golden age of film into a modern day comedy. Just to sit and watch these two act in this type of genre is terrific. What happened to this style of acting?All and all a brilliant comedy.Would love to see a DvD release.
1,"You Get what you pay for, cheaper prices ISNT always a deal","This product is poorly made and has very weak power ( it operates like the batteries are dying) very weak power! I dont recommend this bikini shaver, buy from a well known brand"
5,Utterly delightful!,"Incredibly entertaining. Judith Martin writes about serious topics with brilliant wit, charm, and humor. This book covers a wide variety of relevant topics, and even the ones that may not apply directly to you still are useful in conveying and emphacising the basic principles of manners. This book is helping me to gain clarity on what rudeness is, what politeness is, and on how to respond appropriately. This book is 700+ pages, so be prepared for a long-term relationship (if you intend to finish this book - which I do - at which point I will probably return to the beginning to start reading it over again). I can say this book is changing my life - and my children may at THIS time regret to say that it is changing theirs - but it is ultimately for the better (I intend to raise gentlemen and ladies)!"
4,looking for mister goodbar,"I simply saw this movie many yaers ago and liked it , the sadness , loneliness of this young woman I was greatly moved , however what I want is to know when we can expect to see movie on either DVD or BLU RAY????"
4,Looking for Mr. Nutbar!,"When this movie was released, it was really controversial even though it came out during the height of the swinging '70s. It's a movie that I didn't like too much when I first saw it on TV in the late '70s. Over time though, this movie has really grown on me. It's about a woman that is a teacher of deaf children by day, and a swinging disco mama by night. She is trying to come to terms with her sexuality & relationships, but always seems to have to confront conflict with her family or the men she meets. What always amazed me about this movie was the loser men she meets throughout. This is why I have always affectionately titled this movie as ""Looking For Mr. Nutbar"" The atmosphere is dark & seedy, and can be a depressing movie to watch-especially the heart wrenching end. This doesn't take away from the movie, it just adds some '70s flavour to it! If you are a fan of Diane Keaton, or like movies from the '70s, this is a great choice for your video library."
5,"""I found this DVD!! ""Looking for Mr Goodbar"" (Finally)!!","I found ""Looking for Mr Goodbar"" on DVD, on this site below!www.Films-Classic.comGood luck getting your copy!! This movie is worth waiting for on DVD!!"
5,looking for mr good bar,This is a riviting caultion tail for the yong club goer or bar drinker.I hope every one has seen it.
2,"Hmm, Wendy??I don't know...","I have been listening to Wendy Williams since I was in elementary school. My friends and i have always been fans ( my bestfriend won her very 1st CD player from Wendy on KISS!!). SO when she started hyping this book, I was expecting a grandiose tome of her life, the whys the hows, and of course celebrity talk at it's best. What I got was a poorly written bio about her drug addiction, that fat girl thing, and no real celebrity dish. Every thing that was worth knowing, she made a ""blind item"".Most of this stuff we learned just from listening to the darn show. The only thing I learned about her is that she must have really learned from her mistakes, because a lot of the advice she gives on the show is completly contradictory to the things she's done in her life."
3,A Great Story but Poorly Written,"Wendy is a personality with a lot of fabulous-ity (a favorite Wendyism). She has a great story to tell and she tells it frankly and bars no punches and in a raw street manner which is exactly the tone that is needed. But the story comes across disjointed and repetitive, certain obvious phrases and sentences are repeated within a few pages of each other. The chronology is screwed up in places and literally made me think I had lost my page and was reading something I should have read a chapter earlier. I don't blame Wendy at all, I have heard her speak and she is a fascinating woman. I blame the book's editor and the ghostwriter for not taking the time to tighten it up. If I had to buy it again I still would simply because her story is interesting, which is why I rated 3 stars instead of 1."
1,Wendy should be paying me to read this...,"For starters, the cover of the book makes her look like a porn star. I was almost to ashamed to buy the book because I thought people would think I was reading porn. Second, this book was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read in my life. I found myself skipping pages and trying to find the good parts. I was EXTREMELY disappointed especially since she hyped the book so much on the radio. Also, some of the stories just didn't make sense because they were so underdeveloped. Wendy presents herself as a well-spoken sophisticated woman, but the only thing I saw in this book was a weak addict w/ low self esteem. It was obvious that this book was a rush job. Don't buy this book. Just get it in the library for free....and if you want mine....take it...I won't be reading the book again..."
2,Still looking for the heat!,"I am a regular listener of The Wendy Williams show. As such ,I anxiously awaited the release of this book. To say I was disaapointed would be an understatement. This book was poorly written. To call it a beach read would be giving it too much credit."
2,Better on the Radio,"I was very disappointed, I listen to Wendy Williams everyday on WBLS, I will say it was very interesting reading about her life, but I feel the book was very poorly written, Most of the storys that she told everyone already knew, I thought she was going to reveal names, which did not happen. It was just all over the place. But i have to say, I still Love Her....Please do not write another book"
3,"A great start, but much better still to come","This is the series that started it all, its great for its time, but unlike the many series to follow now looks a little dated. Granted this series had the modest budget of an unproven commodity where as the series that followed had a considerable inflation of resources. This series still had soem amazing episodes but had quite a few clunkers aswell like Space and Ghost in the Machine. Over all you must buy this as it is history in the making."
3,DVD - Poor quality alert!,"I have just received the DVD box set, and in my opinion the transfer is poor. It looks as though the entire thing as been fed through a filter to reduce film noise (and hence improve compression), this results in a very soft picture that has barely more resolution than my VHS copies. Add to this some very obvious 'locking' of the backgrounds (and faces) in some places and what we seem to end up with is a fairly poor showing... I usually buy my DVD's from the states, simply because my experience of UK transfers is not a good one, however I think I'll be a little more careful in future. If you already have them on VHS then I wouldn't bother, otherwise I suppose at least the DVD's have colour.... FYI, I used a Toshiba 2109 and 41"" Sony rear projection."
2,almost painful to watch,"this has got to be one of the worst x-file episodes. The mars ghost face, mu ha ha ha. how lame."
5,Unique,TV will never be the same again. This was the start of one of the strongest shows ever. Especially teh first seasons are really excellent.
1,The price of this box set is an X-Files mystery...,"This box set of the first season of the The X-Files comes on 7 dvds. The design of the box is a sort of ""digi-pack"" that folds open. This is the same style used in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer box sets. The most recent season of Buffy (season 4) had 6 dvds but knocked down about 70 bones in price. Meaning I can get 2.5 seasons worth of material in the Buffy boxed sets. What's going on here? Does Fox use some sort of alien-gold in the manufacturing of their dvd discs that makes them cost so much more? I smell a conspiracy here and it's costing X-Files fans a lot of money."
3,Not the same as the original season sets.,"This reduced price edition of The X-Files: Season 1 differs from the original not only in packaging but in content.The episodes are all here, but the bonus features found on the 7th disc is not. This is evidenced here:http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=5019I also have personally checked this and other reissued sets in the store.Based on this, Fox and Amazon are misleading its customers in calling this the Collector's Edition as though it were the definitive release of the show, when it actually contains less than the original collector's edition."
4,love it,i live in germany so they dont sell this type of tees here and im a huge niner fan. love the t-shirt
2,Confusing portrayal of Jesus in the Temple,"Great license has been taken in making this video. It is hard to follow and many of the scenes seem to have no connection. The BEST part of the video deals with the technicalities of the Temple ... this probably should have been the introductional part with the non-biblical ""fluff"" left out! I had intended to use this with children, aged 5 to 10 ... that would have been a waste of their time!"
2,In the face,"I'm not going to comment so much on this DVD as all the previous writers have covered all the bases. I would like to comment on the whole Cream package, movies, records, cd's etc. Cream was one of the best bands ever, I love them, but I haven't heard one recording that ever did them justice. I think the whole RSO organization used them as a money machine and then cast them aside. None of the recordings or moveis had any real technical know how behind them. One typical feature that has irritated me on a lot of British films are why in the world do they focus on the guitar players face during a solo (Clapton, Hendrix et al) and forget that they ain't singin' man they are playin' that thing they are holding. Anyway I have bought all of the Cream videos I could and just suffer through it all."
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"I love Cream,so I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD.I was disappointed by both the extemely poor sound and video quality. The sound was particularly bad. I couldn't even hear Jack Bruce's vocals becase of the distortion. My favorite part of this DVD was interview part, where each band member spoke about the music and even gave a lesson on their instrument. That was really cool. I recommend that you rent this just for that part alone. This is not worth the purchase price."
2,Why cut it short?,"Do you own the rights to Cream: Farewell Concert? Well listen here pal. How dare you pay somebody to edit Cream. Sure you might have suckered me to buy your chopped up over-edited video but right now I'm telling thousands of people not to. Maybe it was cheaper for you to make a 48 minute video but you ruined the concert with your cut-it-short approach. Someday when I own the rights to this movie I am going to put this video out properly. I encourage CREAM fans to wait until they can buy this video in the complete format the way a ""cocert"" should be."
5,Hey y'all hippies out there - this is great!,"A lot of this was before my time, but I do remember the songs once old enough to enjoy. It's a fun ""go back in time"" rememberance to the way things were back then. Ginger Baker's drum solo will just blow you away - even today!"
3,Where's the rest of it?,"Very intense and powerful stuff. Yes, the fidelity is poor, the effects laughable and some of the interview dialog hysterical (see Spinal Tap) but the jamming is incredible. The major problem is the original movie is 84 minutes long but has been out of print in this length for a long time. Would someone please put out the whole concert film?"
1,What is this for?,"I ordered this product believing that it was one of the ""Isopure"" protein powder products. Oops, this is not protein powder, it's carbohydrate powder with a little protein. Perfect when you can't expand your spare tire fast enough, or your blood sugar drops below 250 or your arteries start to clear out.However, nutritionally, it's not much different from white bread. Not sure why you would use this when cake and donuts would be so much more fun.Seriously, there was no nutrition info on the Web page and the manufacturer's use of the ""Isopure"" label is certainly misleading. I'll use other brands in the future. As a side note, Amazon should really include a link to the full information on products like this. I hate to have to do a Web search for every item I look at."
1,AWEFUL,"Do not buy this thermometer. It is cheaply made of hard plastic. The mercury came separated. I kept it for a few days, turning it often hoping that the mercury would rejoin-no avail. Take your money elsewhere."
2,Not that Amazing,"I had read all of the reviews about Amazing Amanda, but decided to get htis doll for my daughter anyways for Christmas. We were so disapointed that we will be taking it back to the store and my daughter is super upset about this. I set this doll up in a quiet place like the directions say, and my daughter is 7 so she talks clearly. Amanda does not recognize her voice, and in the middle of my daughter playing with her, she will say she is sleepy, and close her eyes to take a nap. Amanda will say it is time to eat, and then after my daughter gets the food Amanda wants, Amanda will say she wants something else.This doll is not what was expected, and I would not recomend it to anyone until all of the kinks are worked out of it."
2,"Dear every kid that wants Amazing amanda,","IF YOU WANT AMAZING AMANDA, IT IS CREEPY! AFTER I TOOK OUT THE BATTERIES,I LAYED IT DOWN IN MY BED. THEN I WENT TO BED.AND IT STARTED TALKING!!! IT SCARED ME!!! SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN TO YOU, THEN GET IT!"
1,Your continuous negative reviews had me return this doll...,"Thanks to all who submitted reviews. I initally bought this doll in November for my 6 year old for Christmas, but returned it having read all the continuous negative reviews. I instead am writing a letter to place in her stocking from Santa about how Amanda needs to go back to the ""toyshop"" for refurbishing. I did notice however, that PLAYMATES is trying to improve the battery situation. Amanda initally took 3 ""C"" batteries, now she takes 4 ""C"" batteries. I am holding out for when the doll can walk over to an outlet and plug her self in to recharge. A $100 dollar gameboy can be recharged, why can't a doll?"
2,too many questions!,"My daughter was SO excited to have this doll for Christmas and she had SO much fun for about 7 minutes then she turned her off and said, ""she asks too many questions!"" She's annoying. Always talking. Not worth it. Seriously."
2,Save money and buy Pooh - knows your name,"Amanda can't hook up to the computer. Amanda doesn't know your childs name, or even what food or color that your child likes. Pooh is priced better, and knows these things. We have both Pooh and Amanda, Pooh gets more playing time. Oh, and we had the ""eye-lash"" problem with Amanda.. I just moved it around till it slid back into its slot (sliding it carefully side to side, and pushing carefully)."
2,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED! THE TOY MADE MY HEAD HURT AND I AM AN ADULT!,"It is Christmas morning and my 5 year old was excited as my husband and I both were. We had seen it on TV so we rushed to purchase this toy. OK, so the voice recognition part took some time but my daughter was quite patient.What made her upset, and I do mean cry was the Amanda did not recognize her voice and asked her over and over what was her name. It got so bad that my daughter said that she wants a doll that does not talk!I think its great that it worked for some parents, but you should not be angry with people who have had a very negative experience with this toy. Its a shame, but for me at the end of the day the idea of a toy that I spent so much money on is that my child should be having a positive experience, not a negative one.I will be returning this toy to the store."
1,Amanda has short-term memory!,"I bought this at TOYS R US for $100 (super big waste.) She looked very cool on tv, so I thought I would give her a try. When I got her home, her mouth and eye lash colors fell off and she kept forgeting my name for 2 hours and her voice usually skips like a scrathed cd when she sings this retarded tosies song. I don't reccomind this to anyone except for garbage men! :)"
2,Challenging,"After a long, annoying setup process this doll still doesn't seem to recognize my daughter's voice. It didn't keep the correct time of day and forced me to reset all date/time settings the next morning. I think the bottom age user needs to be higher than 5/6 years old. Quite a letdown for something se wanted so bad. If it were not a birthday gift, I would return it for money back. Possibly ok for an older child, but not a 5 year old."
3,waste of money,I think the Amazing Amanda is over priced and as my 5 year old daughter puts it-annoying. The doll need to be reset almost every time you you use it. The lips wore off almost immediately and the batteries don't last very long. The eyes are not very durable and came apart after only a few weeks. I definitely would not recommend this doll.
1,Very Frustrating,I bought this doll for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She was so excited until she actually tried to play with it. We followed all of the set up directions and programmed the doll in a quiet room and it still would not work correctly. It would not recognize my daughters voice. She finally gave up and the doll has sat in her closet for almost a year. When I ask her if she wants to try again she says no that Amanda doesn't work right. It is very frustrating especially for the amount of money it cost.
1,Whar Disease Did Lea Thompson Have?,She apparently had the same disease that Ali MacGraw had in Love Story. This disease causes the sufferer to get more beautiful as she gets closer to death!
1,bad stand,I got this stand to hold memeory cards for my son. It did not work. You had to put the card on just right and most of the time it did not stay on. He never tried it for holding his PS2 - he was afraid to.
1,Bad knife!,"I collect knives as a hobby and was very excited for this knife to come but when I got it it was very dull, and it has an odd blade that doesn't work in sharpeners well."
2,The Awakening Heart: My Continueing Journey to Love,"I loved Betty Eadie's first book. It was excellent. But this book was uncomfortable for me as a Christian. It seemed she was getting into areas that were unbiblical. I know she is a Christian, but she is mixing new age with her Christianity. I feel that if you are a Christian, you may want to skip this book. It is not as good as her Embraced by the Light. I finally threw the book away when it conflicted SO MUCH with the Bible. I couldn't take any more. Book 1, Embraced by the Light is pretty good. Read and get the good and spit out the bones."
5,Great Workout,"This is one of the best work out videos ever. Even though it's been around for quite a while, it's still one of my top picks!"
5,Beautiful,"It's a very beautiful ring, and the amethyst stone has a very lovely purple color. The rind doesn't catch on fabric which pleased me very much."
3,A pleasant enough read but ultimately a disappointment,"Every year I look forward to Signet's Regency Christmas anthology with great anticipation because it nearly always is a showcase for their best writers. Unfortunately, this time, these authors (some of whom are auto-buys for me) did not come up to scratch.The exception in the collection was Carla Kelly who has written another of her exquisitely polished little gems. As ever, she gives us a beta hero caught in a poignant situation helped by a wise and understanding heroine. Edith Layton's story, however, was no way up to her usual high standards. Emma Jensen's offering was simply too boring to catch my attention and Sandra Heath's shallow and a little absurd. Barbara Metzger's story was light and amusing but she can do better.Worth reading but not as good a Signet's previous offerings. I wonder if this is because Mary Balogh has her own Christmas anthology this year and did not appear in this one."
4,A must buy,What is good about this book is that it not only covers the familiar bad boys like Bogart and Mitchum but also such lesser known but nonetheless fascinating men like Tom Neal and Lawrence Tierney. And it covers the entire history of Hollywood from Wallace Reid of the silent era to Robert Blake who is in today's headlines. Anyone who knows Parish's books will want this one. And anyone who doesn't better start.
3,Too Easy,"If you are a true Simpsons fan you will be somewhat disssapointed with this trivia game. For someone who has seen all the episodes, this game runs by all to easily. I was playing the game with someone who had watched the series little and suprisingly they where doing very well, this led into an argument which went on for a few minutes. Well, I guess this is a good game for people who know a bit about the Simpsons, but for true fans, buy it if you have some extra cash. For theses reasons I give it a 3."
3,You have to be HARDCORE,"I'm an avid Simpsons fan, my friends all think I'm completely obsessed, though I know otherwise... So, the directions are quite complex, we college students never have the patience to properly follow them, we tend to just break out the question cards and compete for most answers. It's fun enough, but not worth the $$ you lay down for it. Mine was thankfully, a gift :o) The questions range in 5 different levels, from way too easy, to impossibly hard."
2,"Good idea, but unreliable spray and clunky design","This is the first oil mister I bought. I liked it well enough at first, but it got so it wouldn't spray reliably. It also isn't the prettiest gadget to look at, which is more important than you might think when it's living on your kitchen counter. To replace it after it went kaput entirely, I bought this product instead:Prepara Oil Mister, White. It's attractive and so far has had a much more reliable spray."
4,Decent sprayer,"This is the second oil sprayer I've owned. I forget what happened to the first ... at any rate, this one works like the other one did. It sprays fairly well, but not for very long. You pump it several times, spray for a bit, then pump it more, spray some more, repeat ... it's annoying to have to repeat it so often, but if you want just a little olive oil on something, it works. I've never had any issues with it getting jammed or plugged up. That was a concern I had when I read other reviews for various oil sprayers. Maybe the kind of oil you use matters? I use extra virgin olive oil."
4,fun for varying ages,"Both of our girls, age 2 and 6 love the calico critter line. It is costly for what you get but the cost is worth it when it entertains a wide age range and siblings play well together. We even have found that the boys that come for playdates like them so there is appeal for all. We will definitely purchase more of this line."
5,Becoming a Helper,fabulous book! really good advice and helps newcomers that are going into a field that deals with helping others not so tense. a must read if you're considering a career in something like this.
1,"neat idea, but doesn't work","I bought these for my son at Christmas and we're taking them back because they do not stay together. The magnets are not strong enough to hold the limbs on and so when you hold upright, it falls apart. We tried two figures, same scenario. My son loves Magnetix, but these were disappointing."
3,OK product,Works OK but not very strong. Does not hold on top of the tape (if you tape over the tape).
1,"Cheap foam, did not help","These toe separators do not have any support or stability. You cannot ware them without socks not even at night, since they fall out easily. I did not get much use out of them, in fact I have most of them still left since I got discouraged from lack of results and stability."
1,Don't Bother,"If you are looking for something funny, don't bother buying this! Even if you are only play ing for the shipping/handling its not worth the money. This is NOT funny. It is pretty boring. I liked Dennis Miller's show on HBO, but not this CD. Its not worth any stars."
2,...and i am not this jaded,"I've never owned a book of professional photography but was inspired by the reviewer notes to buy this online without a preview. I can honestly say that if i had been able to open the pages and experience the images even briefly--i wouldn't have purchased the collection. Yes, the psychological interiour is filled with murky matter and we are bound to witness it and some are gifted at illuminating it, but there was no heart revelation in this work for me. It just kind of felt ragged out and sloppy. No, we don't need another book of glossy yosemite postcards, but for thirty bucks and all the accolades i expected more of a transformative experience and less ""event-bam"". But hey, the snake on the den floor was cool."
5,"Great Company, everything fits!!!","I had to order everything for my daughter online and I came accross the Cheerleading Company doing Google search, this is the Best rated company, they have everything you need, I will recommend to go to their website and order directly from them, they give you a flat rate for the shipping, instead of charging per item like Amazon does, I had everything in less than a week, please make sure to check their size chart and measure the person, the only problem is the shoes, cheerleading shoes run small and tight, I order a size bigger they fit fine, good luck shopping..."
5,"Great Team, Great Disk!","From the ashes of Team Turmoil rose Team Supreme, Tubby Smith's triumphant 2003 Kentucky Wildcats! This disk recaps the 2003 season. If you're a UK fan, buy this disk!"
1,HATED IT!,I didn't realize the movie was 12 minutes long. I was expecting a full length movie. Even my 7 year old was upset. Next time i'll read the fine print!
3,Missing Glasses,"Unfortunately, even though the DVD case claimed to contain 3D glasses to go with the DVD -- it didn't. Furthermore, while I have plenty of sets of red-blue anaglyph glasses with other DVDs, this one requires magenta-green lensed anaglyph glasses -- of which I have none. So, until I get my hands on some of those, my son can't watch this yet. (I gave it a quick preview, and it seems OK. I think he'll like it... eventually.)"
3,Not at all right for the Blues Jr.!!!,"The previous reviewer is correct. This speaker strongly favors the treble frequencies and the geniuses at Fender decided to put it in their new Limited Edition 2-tone ""Black/Red"" Blues Junior. And what do you get? Nothing but top end. Cranking up the bass knob makes no audible difference. Nice going guys! But it's really not as ""shrill"" as all that though. It's actually a smooth, somewhat creamy treble character... just lots of it. I can see these speaker working well if you have a muddy, bottom-heavy 4x12"" stack to get more articulation, or combining them with some Governors or some such like that ~"
4,An Epic Debut Album From The Art Garfunkel Era,"This solo debut album of Art Garfunkel, which came out in September 1973, is a great collection of folk songs. I say the best songs are ""I Shall Sing"", ""Old Man"", ""Feuilles-oh""/""Do Space Men Pass Dead Souls On Their Way To The Moon?"", ""All I Know"", and ""Barbara Allen"". It was also a Gold Disc winner. Artie has great taste in songs, and has a great angelic voice."
4,Good but ...,"For some reason the two heros here reminded me of Bryan from The Secret Life of Bryan, which is probably unfair because these two guys, while pretty good, do not hold a candle to Bryan. The two stories ARE good though."
2,Worth every of your buck when it works.,"I got this player half year ago, and actually have been using it for 3 months. I applauded for its oustanding price/feature ratio until recently it broke down. Its mechanical moving part, including laser head and CD spinner, frequently locked itself, generating huge ""click"" sound. If it's lucky starting playing a CD, everything is okay. But when it moves from one CD to another, in random or sequencial order, the moving part gets stuck forever. Yes, I bought it at a very sweet price, as long as it still worked. To me, the moving mechanism inside is kinda fragile."
1,Fails to change disks,"I was never really happy with this changer due to the noisy clicking sound it made when changing discs. Then, about a year after purchase, it stopped changing discs altogether. Makes a horrible noise as it tries to change discs, then displayes an error message and won't even shut off when the power button is pressed! I would not recommend this product."
1,Was fine til it stopped working,"I didn't have any clicking problems, but just before the year was up, it would just stop playing on random and sit at the first disk. I brought it to one place recommended by Pioneer and had to wait about two months to get it back. About six weeks later the same thing occurred, brought it to another fix-it shop and am told that there is nothing wrong with it. I just think it is not built well and will have intermittant problems until I buy a new and different one."
5,great basketball,ASIN:B002OMDCZ2 Baden Lexum Comp Official Wide Channel Basketball]]Gift for my grandson and he loved it!! It was one of his favorite christmas gifts.
4,"Thought-Provoking Tome, if a Little Tedious","Miner presents a worthy and fascinating premise. It's interesting reading if you can get through a lot of the history, especially in the first half of the book. Some of the lecture gets a little repetitive and tedious, and I found myself skipping whole sections just to stay on point. A few digressions, some entertaining and pertinent, some less so. But all in all, and interesting book that I enjoyed overall. At least provokes some serious thought on the subject, and on ancillary topics such as politics, religion, and marriage. I'm not sure I agree 100% with where Miner would be on all these things, but it invites further thinking and study on the matter."
1,What a mess,"I can't seem to figure out what Mr. Minor is trying to accomplish with this book. The book starts out as a history of knights, chivalry and warriors? Then turns into a collection of Victorian quotes about man's role? And in the end it feels like a justification of the author's conservative beliefs? In any case this book is a mess! I had high hopes with chapter titles like ""The Warrior"", ""The Lover"", ""The Monk"". However these don't lead very far from small stories and mild rants on modern culture. Most disappointing is his justification of the Iraq war and his own navel gazing rationalization of his conscientious-objector status during the Vietnam war. Skip this book and turn to more interesting material like Robert Moore, Michael Meade or Sam Keen."
5,Top of the Line for Usefulness,"I got this book for Christmas and have enjoyed just browsing through it, though I expect it to be useful as a reference book as well. I think the author (or maybe the publisher) did a neat job of updating the King James Version so that the quotes sound poetic but are still easy to understand. (They did away with all the words like 'thee' and 'thou' and so on.) I have recommended this to people in my church because I think its topical arrangement makes it easy to find what you're looking for in practically any subject area."
4,"A thoughtful presentation, should be read by everyone","This book, by a trained miliatry historian, lays out a case for the avoidance of terror against civilian populations. It then goes on to define terror in ways I had never considered.Particularly disturbing are several discussions about the consistency with which indiginous military trained by an outside invader turn on that selfsame invader after the invasion is over. ( Sound familiar? Mujahadeen anyone?)The early sections on the tactics of the Roman Empire were quite revealing, particularly given the parallels with modern practice.Well worth the time."
5,It wil make you think. . . .,"An impressive, well-organized and thought-provoking collection of paranormal events as described by those who experienced those events. The author has done an impressive job of organizing the material contributed by those who confronted that which is hard to explain, but, for the most part, welcomed, finding reassurance both in this life and beyond."
5,Lasts a long time,Great in combination with the shampoo to keep your color long lasting. A little pricey but it lasts a long time
3,Could be better,"This guy makes so many mistakes that is almost hard to believe he has been doing this for as long as he says he has (sometimes he does catch them though). Also, his voice and speech is so annoying. He adds an ""er""sound to every other word, i.e. Instead of saying ""theta"" he says ""thether."" It gets really really annoying after awhile. The price listed on his website for these DVDs are 50+ dollars which is totally outrageous. For a cheaper price, it may be an ok buy."
1,Are you kidding?!?!?,I'll bet Panasonic will discontinue this product faster than the French lose a European land war. Anyone who would waste money on this thing clearly knows nothing about the capabilities of modern laptop DVD drives.
4,Great product but not enough Sound,I have had my portable DVD for about a year and a half now without one problem. This is a great product if you are a constant traveller as I am. This is also a terrific product if you have to travel with kids. The only downside of this product is that the little speakers and even when you use the headphones the volume just is not there. Other than the sound this is a great product.
1,Not worth it,"It heats up too much, the remote is too small and it is WAY too expensive. The sound quality is awful unless you have high-end headphones. The lone bright spot is the display, but it's nothing a laptop computer doesn't have. Panasonic should strip off the sound, and ability to connect to your home theater to lower the cost."
5,It rocks!,I bought this unit about 3 months ago on a whim and it has been fantastic. It's great for long flights although you will probably want to get an extra battery if you're going to be up in the air for more than 4 hours. I've also found myself watching 2 to 3 DVD's a week at home which has been great--especially since I don't own a TV.
4,El Retorno de una gran Banda !!!,"En mi opinion el concierto fue muy bueno , puedo decir que mejor que al que asisti en Fort Lauderlade - Florida, donde ellos empezaron el tour en EEUU. a pesar de la delicada salud de Mick Mars , su performance fue excelente ,el bajo contundente de NIkki Sixx, un poco fuera de escena fue su solo con los sintetizadores , lo mismo paso con Tommy Lee a pesar de realizar una excelente performance en la bateria , muchos bateristas que estaban en el publico esperaban un solo para bateristas y se dieron con la sorpresa de encontrar a un DJ de una discoteca, un o de los puntos que me decepcionaron del show . pero en lo general parece que la gente lo disfruto ."
3,MOTLEY CRUE DVD,"I WAS IN KNOXVILLE FOR THE SHOW AS WELL!!! THE ""CARNIVAL"" ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT, ALL THE MIDGETS, STRIPPERS AND MOTORCYCLES WERE GREAT!!! THE MUSIC PLAYED BY THE 3 MUSICIANS WAS EXCELLENT. NOW IF VINCE NEIL COULD SING ALL THE LYRICS TO THE SONGS I COULD GIVE THEM A 10 ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5. MAYBE SOMEONE ON THE SOUND BOARD CAN TWEAK SOME KNOBS SO THAT IT WILL BE AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE TO WATCH THE DVD."
2,Horrible Sound,"Firstly, I never write reviews but this blu-ray has compelled me to write one. The sound is so poor it is a joke, you could get better sound out of a VHS video tape. I have got a reference level $20k home theatre system and it gets the best out of any source. The vocals are ok but the drums and guitars sound so muffled you can't distinguish much at all. The sound is only encoded with Dolby Digital and not lossless like TrueHD etc. Even a Motley Crue die hard fan will be disappointed with this presentation. Buy at your your own risk - it is rubbish ! I wish I could send it back for a refund and I love Motley Crue."
2,Bad Sound,"The concert is nice, but the dvd sound is very poor, the voice chanel is very low and is satured by the sorround channel.I listen the stereo, 5.1 and DTS track, but all tracks is the same problem... Voice channel low and public screams satured."
2,Not nearly as good as the UK version...,"I have to respectfully disagree with those who feel that this show was so fantastic. No offense, but Touching Evil US does not come close to the quality of Touching Evil UK. And as much as I love Jeffery Donovan in Burn Notice, he couldn't hold a candle to Robson Green as Det. Creegan. Has anyone who has watched the US version even seen the UK version? Granted, when it first came out in the US you could only see it on PBS. Check it out if you can find an episode on the net!"
5,awesome footage,This dvd included lots of vintage Lennon footage I either hadn't seen in years or had never seen. It was historically accurate and I would highly recommend it.
3,John Lennon purchase,"The cover is better then the video but worth a purchase for anyone who is in love with the beatles to at least see the footage of John. I wouldn't consider it rare or unseen, but worth the 13.00 to purchase and have someone view it who enjoys watching anything and everything of John Lennon and the bEatles."
3,It's ok...mildly interesting,There is some new footage here...it's worth watching if you are a diehard Lennon fan.
5,This album will blow you socks off!,"This is one of those lucky finds. Never heard of Paul Pena until I watched Genghis Blues (for my interest in Tuvan music).Decided to look into the man's own works. Absolutely incredible artistry on this album. If you buy only one album this year, get this one!"
5,Rock On,What a great album (CD). I've been a blues and R&B fan all my life and I don't know how this guy stayed under my radar.
4,Gonna Move On,"Really enjoyed Paul's music fromGenghis Blues. Solid blues tradition, from the soul. You will be sorely missed, Paul."
3,"Try ""Totoal Body Training Pilates"" instead","Although this is a good workout, Karen Voight has many the same workouts in different titles. This workout contains in her ""Totoal Body Training Pilates""Karen Voight: Total Body Trainingthat has another pilates workout with resitant ring. The price is almost the same (depends on Amazon's sales price - ASIN: B0009KA8IA ) so if you purchase the other DVD, you can get this Abdominals & Back workouts as well as Total Body Training with resistant ring ~50 min and a bonus of how to use the ring ~8 min. Read fine prints and actual workout tiltes for KV's workouts. She has the most confusing titles.PS. She has two total body pilates workout titkes: ""Total Body Pilates"" and ""Total Body Training Pilates."" The latter one is cheaper for the same workout with bonus (and see my review)."
4,A good workout :-),"This 45 minute workout is really good although a little practice is needed to get it right. The moves can be challenging and you may not pick it up first go. You'll definately increase your range of flexibility and you'll strengthen your core muscles. Karen is definately one of the best cuers and instructors out there. She's great at letting you know what's up next and she has a soft spoken and friendly way of getting those instructions out. You are working the abs and back at most/all of the time and before you know it, you're done. She keeps you busy from start to end and you have fun while you're at it.Don't get frustrated if you don't get it first time around. While I'm not completely new to Pilates, it's not always easy, but so enjoyable to do that it's worth the 'practice' and you'll feel really good afterwards."
5,great pilates tape!,"Pilates are hard! You know those moments in a pilates class when you find yourself actively hating the person making you do these really hard painful things? Well, she moves so quickly through the exercises that you can do them. This is the first pilates tape I've bought that I feel exercised and competent doing. I'm sore the next day, in that really great ""I did Pilates!"" way. It's working and it's doable."
3,Convenient but............,"This is a very convenient cuff to use, but I would question the accuracy. After purchase, I took it to my physician's office to check it's accuracy with their mercury cuff readings. This model seemed to be running about 10 mm higher than the Dr.'s cuff. Their office also had an older model AMD (now Lifesource)767 and my cuff was also measuring higher than this one. I will use it. but the question of it's accuracy will certainly continue to nag me. Interestingly, at the Dr's office we put the cuff fromthe 767 on mine and it seemed to be more in line with the other readings.I would certainly advise everyone buying a cuff to take it to their Dr's office to compare it's reading with the office model."
2,Incorrect readings!!!!!!!,"Hello,I recently bought this blood pressure monitor.....it functions all well......BUT it gives incorrect readings.......i mean the readings vary significantly........not once , twice...but many many times......I was and am never sure about the validity of the readings.....Purchase this at your own risk.....my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors.....atleast u will know that the readings r genuine...and u can ALWAYS find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings......Take care and stay healthy......."
5,Roommates From Hell,"There's nothing I love as much as a good, literate suspense thriller. I've heard film-buff friends raving about this movie over the years, but I never saw it till now. It's finally out on DVD, and boy-oh-boy, it is something to see! The writer/director was inspired by the films of Roman Polanski (particularly REPULSION and THE TENANT), not to mention Hitchcock. If you're a fan of their work, check this out. You'll experience a growing sense of dread throughout this weird tale of madness, obsession, and murder, and Colin Firth and Hart Bochner are the creepiest pair since Leopold met Loeb. APARTMENT ZERO is a quiet, elegant, genuinely frightening gem."
3,Bizarre psychological thriller with young Colin Firth,"Bizarre psychological thriller with a lot of dysfunctional personalities. A young Colin Firth does a great job in portraying the socially awkward, misanthropic cinema owner, whose only human tie is with his deranged mother who is in a geriatric home. Colin makes his character's loneliness and emotional vulnerability very tangible...making the final scenes all the more surprising. Jack Carney, played by Hart Bochner, is a seductive, elusive character reminiscent of The Crying Game.The lighting and cinematography adds to the drama. However, the film seemed to drag a bit in the middle, and some of the connections didn't seem to fit. For example, who was the older bald-headed man Jack met with? Other than seeing Colin Firth in one of his earlier roles, I don't think I would recommend this movie."
2,Well past its prime,After reading what would appear to be hyped-up reviews I decided to purchase this DVD. I took into account when it was made so I expected one or two shortcomings however I have to admit to still being disappointed. Every climax is marred by the seeming reluctance to go one frame further with Colin Firth and Hart Bocher's performances packing very little punch. While this is a shame it just goes to prove how far the cinema has advanced and how much more we expect both visually and in the in-depth acting.
4,Any movie with COLIN FIRTH in it is GREAT!!,"Colin Firth acted every-well in it as usual. Though I had a hard conceiving whether Colin and Hart were going to fall in love. I like the movie because there was alot of supense, that had me sitting at the end of my chair. A GREAT MOVIE!!"
2,"great movie, bad transfer","I loved this one when it came out, so I couldn't resist picking up the DVD for under $5. What a waste. The DVD is simply a copy of a VHS taped copy & of rather dubious origins, despite the legitimate looking info on the back sleeve (no mention of copyright info.). Hopefully this will get a proper anamorphic release sometime soon."
5,Cassette Deck Review,I have had no problems with the JVC dual cassette deck. It seems to work just great. I would sincerely recommend it.
4,"Nice pants, kind of big","I ordered these pants and they feel really nice and are made of a durable material. However, I ordered the White/Black in2X-Large, and the pants are kind of big on me. I have to wear them higher than my other pants, which I'm fine with personally, but I recommend ordering these a size or two smaller than what you normally wear. Otherwise, these pants are great quality :)"
2,Caveat Emptor,"I bought this unit ... two years ago. Mine has been in the shop for replacement of the Laser/Reader/Drawer assembly because it failed to read discs. This caused me to throw away at least 5 perfectly good CD-R's assuming they were faulty. The unit is doing the same thing again. That's the reason I'm shopping for a replacement. (It burned approximately 25 CD's before the repair and about 35 since.)The unit sounds good but, too many functions are available only from the remote (especially program playback) and I have serious doubts about reliability.As I said in my title - CAVEAT EMPTOR - Buyer Beware."
1,The Sinking of Noah's Ark,"This book was terrible. I hated it. As a Christian, this book makes a mockery of the Christian faith. Christianity is the only true faith and this book makes it sound like all faiths are equal and it says the Bible is not God's words. How awful! I can not believe this book was actually published! I hate this book. Christians out there, don't read it! The author has no idea what God is."
4,Using with my 18oz Klean Kanteen bottle,"I purchased this to use with my 18oz Klean Kanteen bottle. It's a good fit, and I had no problems putting it on the bottle. I like to fill the bottle with ice water and keep it next to the bed at night. The water stays ice cold until after I fall asleep. For reference, by the time I wake up in the morning, the ice is melted, but the water is still slightly cooler than room temp. Equally important, I don't have to worry about the bottle sweating and leaving a pool of condensation on my furniture all night.I like this product that does what it is designed and sold to do!"
5,Good Guide,This guide was very good and helpful for me when i whisked through this game... i used it only when i didn't know where to go next.. and it was right on..
3,Not Quite What I Thought,Most if not all exercises were done on the floor. The only difference between the beginner and intermediate versions is the reps given to each of the exercises. I thought there should have been more exercises while standing.
4,Packed with facts but not quite bed-time reading!,"A seriously comprehensive book covering all aspects of the Holy Roman Empire. Very readable in terms of fact collection, though the style of the prose is rather dry! Never mind - all you ever want to know about the most important political institution ever."
4,pros and cons,"pros:* Clear explanation, easy to read.* More complete and examples than <<Enterprise Javabeans>> by Richard Monson-Haefel* BEA Web logic CD* Good references at the end* Objective: it says what is good and what is bad as well. It seems to be a serious book and not a specfication/product advertissement.cons:* Duplication, not concise.* No explanation for CD.* No JSP, only examples for j2ee, does not really cover j2ee.* EJB1.0 only, not EJB1.1Conclusion:Buy it with <<Enterprise Javabeans>> by Richard Monson-Haefel, or wait for a better one it you are not in hurry."
3,Outdated,"This book really needs to be updated, the 1.0 stuff is way out of date. I also found the example subjects to be sort of weird in some cases, he uses this ""component game"" at one point. I think it would be more illustrative if he stuck to real world business situations that practicioners encounter. One thing I think is really cool is that this is online. It also definitely contains a good deal of valuable info but with the EJB 2.0 spec final now, he really needs to get a new edition out."
3,A POLICEMAN IS ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE,"This is a 1987 Australian film.David (Miles Buchanan) and Jack (Marcus Graham) are two good friends attending college. Jack works out and David knows computers. They are on the onset of dating Kathryn (Kathryn Walker) and Ziggy (Sandie Lillingston). There is also a psychotic suspended police officer named Murphy (Steven Grives) who has it in for Jack and anyone he knows. This isn't a who-dun-it. We know Murphy is the killer (see DVD cover).The kids, on a bet, enter a huge department store at night, only to get trapped inside by the creepy Murphy. Like Val Kilmer in ""The Traveler"" Murphy likes to whistle, except his tune is ""When Irish Eyes are Smiling."" The film manages to generate suspense.If you like kids in a store, try ""Chopping Mall.""Parental Guide: No sex, nudity, or F-bombs."
3,Violent bounty-hunter with a heart.,"Sam is a reluctant bounty-hunter who does not mind when he kills a guilty person. The story told the story of Sam Curtin very well, along with the other folks in the story. The setting wasn't much, I never got a good feeling for what it was like where he lived. I wasn't too pleased with the amount of violence either. If you like violent westerns where the characters are fleshed out pretty well, this is a book for you."
3,Used to like it but now annoyed.,"I have had this scale for over two years and I didn't used to have problems with it. I am finding I want a more accurate weight and not just rounding to the quarter ounce or 5 gram mark. I've got used to the readout on the side but it does take me leaning down low to look under a plate that I'm weighing with. What I'm finding extremely annoying now is that the scale keeps turning off when I'm in the middle of weighing things (battery indicator not showing low). Horrible when adding things directly into one bowl while using the tare feature. With the scale already rounding its weight, I am not able to get a close-to-true weight at all. I don't really have a problem with cleaning the scale because I don't put the things I'm weighing in direct contact with the scale. I always weigh with a bowl, plate, or piece of wax paper/plastic wrap covering the weighing area."
2,It's not what you think,"I bought this book to add to my research of ETs in the Bible, but this book is not what the Title promises. It's just a rather short compilation of essays from the author about the possible connection, with just a few scriptures. I have seen way better through other authors who make the argument better through highlighting more scriptures. The concept is real though, but this author falls short on proving it."
4,FINALLY!!!,"I don't know what deafheaven's problem is but this is the kind of fun stuff that I like watching. Sorry, but the point of entertainment is to entertain and I thoroughly enjoyed the ludicrous ways the boys are able to get out of any situation. It's the imagination and just sheer fun of this show that made it so popular.I find shows like Friends to be INCREDIBLY boring and lacking in a lot of imagination and point to that show as what's wrong with TV."
2,Disappointing.,"I love the A-Team, but this box set left me disappointed. The description stating Dolby Digital 2.0 for the audio track is misleading since the audio is in mono, not stereo. I was also hoping there would be ""some"" extras in the set in addition to just the episodes."
1,Liked The Show Growing Up But Sadly The Magics Faded,When you're a kid you remember some shows fondly and some with distaste and when you grow up it changes this show is one of them. Let me say that while the actors aren't bad but when I started watching some of these episodes and seeing all the explosions and bullets flying I'm surprised that neither any of the A-team members or the people their fighting got seriously injured or hurt I mean they would just shake themselves off and just walk away. PLEASE! I know this show wasn't meant to be taking as a very dramatic show but as I see these episodes now that I'm an adult I just can't feel but wonder what I found so appealing about this show as a kid. Again this is just a personal review so to all fans of the show don't get to hostile if you like the show and want people to know why make a review and explain your reasons for it.
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There is only one way to describe this event.YES!This is the greatest day of my life! I have been waiting so long for someone to come to their senses and put this fantastic TV show on DVD, and it has finally happened. They don't make shows like this anymore, and they really should. Once again, I must say, YES!"
5,Justamente reconocido!,"Gano 4 Grammy's Latinos!! Que bien, se los merece.No se pierdan el 15 de Noviembre el Unplugged por MTV (latino).Tengo el Cd desde hace tiempo, todas y cada una de las canciones se vale por si misma, todas son buenas, todas tienen algo.Estoy esperando que saque algo nuevo. Se que en el Unplugged hay 3 nuevas canciones, las dos primeras y el exito a ser Y Solo Se Me Ocurre Amarte."
3,Mas o menos?,"La pregunta es si Alejandro es mejor ahora que tiene su carrera solo y si estaba mejor con Mas? Parece que le servio mejor estar con grupo y que no esta lista para carrera de artista solo.Este senor no merece toda la publicidad y los premios que ha recibido por este disco. Me gusta algunas canciones pero no mas tanto. Su voz es muy gentile y los arreglos dominan su voz. Muy romantico con unos emociones sensibles pero no hay nada extraordinarioen su voz de chispita. Si te gusta la musicaromantica hay varios otros artistas latinos como Luis Miguel, Alej Fernandez o Enrique Iglesias que cantan mejor y con mas fiebre. Lo que falta con este disco es las gran emociones de los gfran artistas que son pocos. En mi opinion este disco es de la nivel segundo abajo de los otros artistas mencionado.Con la excepcion de la cancion "" Quisiera Ser"" que si saca las emociones hondos, este disco es normal y nada especial."
4,El Alma al aire,"I am a fan of Alejandro Sanz since 1995 and I have listened to all his albums. I think the best one is Alejandro Sanz 3 because in that record you can really notice Alejandro's soul through the songs, it presents a peerless singer. but El Alma al Aire changes that style and shows a more common singer,his music is good but is not as especial and unique as in his former albums. The new songs do not make me feel as in a roller coaster. However Alejandro is the best!"
2,Moderately amusing,"Sophomoric send-up of ""The Rules"" in the style of National Lampoon. ""The Rules"" richly deserved a good send-up for its codification of double standards, manipulation, misrepresentation, and man-trapping. This isn't it.The first few chapters are fairly amusing if you've got nothing better to do, but the humor becomes more contrived as you read on. Then it uses highbrow words while trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, sometimes leaving the reader wondering WHAT their actual joke/point was. Nate and Lawrence are to be lauded for their efforts, but fell short of their noble goal.""The Rules"" was actually funnier - read it with an inquiring mind, then imagine the sort of unimaginative, artificial, incapable-of-independent-thought woman that believes every word it says."
3,"It's not bad, but not great","It's ok, but not great. Really thin, almost like pantyhose. Zipper is hard to manage as well."
1,"Murder She Wrote, Complete Season 1","When I received the shipment, the dvd's were finely scratched. I have watched some of them and they play OK but do skip and stop. I am thinking about returning them but I don't have the packing slip. If I can exchange this box for another one, please let me know. This is the first time I have ever been unhappy with this type of product."
4,"Murder, She Wrote","I am a ""Murder, She Wrote"" junkie. Sometimes I can find six hours of MSW on during the day. When I began watching in 1984, I wished that I had an aunt exactly like Jessica. She was kind, intelligent and unasuming and went from being a small-town author who wrote because she was lonely to a well-traveled savvy lady who didn't take guff from anyone. Jessica is everything I look for in a best friend. Actually, she IS my best friend. Now that I am closer to her age, I look forward to being as independant and resourceful as she is. I want to BE her. Angela Lansbury has no idea how inspirational her character has been to so many of us, and I can't wait until ALL of the episodes are available on DVD."
3,finally my fave show on dvd,"i was so excited to receive this dvd in the mail. when i finally put it in the dvd player, i noticed the second and third discs are not working properly. they skip through secenes, are blurry, or just freeze up. i do love this show, but due to the poor quality i only give it 3 stars. i hope the makers of this dvd changed the poor quality for the second season"
4,"Great Show, So-So DVD","I love ""Murder, She Wrote."" It takes some major clever writing to come up with a one hour whodunnit for each episode, and still be challenging and entertaining, but this show managed to do it for 12 seasons. Angela Lansbury is completely delightful and its fun watching a parade of guest stars from various TV shows involved in the mayhem.The DVD's, however, leave much to be desired. Considering how beloved this show was during its TV run, you would think Universal would have provided some extras. Instead, we get the annoying new double sided disc treatment (careful of fingerprints!) and nothing extra; an example of a cheaply done DVD release for a major series. Certainly worth getting--the episodes alone are wonderful entertainment--but lets hope season 2 sees something extra for the legion of fans of this great show."
5,"""Murder, She Wrote"" (Season 1 on DVD)","I knew that when I purchased this DVD just yesterday I would be making a wise decision. It is very clever and very entertaining. It will definately go down as one of the most popular television programs ever. I love this show and shall always cherish it. I am so thankful that they placed it on DVD. If you are a Angela lansbury fan and a fan of ""Murder, She Wrote"", as am I, this is for you."
3,Universal better get a clue!,"This is my all time favorite show. I am in my early 30's and my mom and I watched this show religiously weekly. Sadly though, I also had issues with the scrambling picture and poor DVD quality. I LOVE the episodes but unfortunately too many of them scramble for me to enjoy them. I get more frustration than enjoyment. Amazon has exchanged two sets of season two. Finally resulting in a refund. Their customer service is impeccable! I am so leery to purchase season 3 but i cannot resist! I guess some Angela is better than no Angela!"
3,"The Name ""Paul Mooney"" frightens like the words ""Black Power"" once did","Paul Mooney is O.J. without the knife and the thirst for blondes. Excuse the pun, but he is as cutting edge as they come, and his weapon of choice is a rapier-like wit.Mooney doesn't mind a little bloodletting, as long as it isn't his, nor that of those who look like him.Most white people won't get it, but those who listen carefully will. And while this is not some attempt to guilt-trip white America, it will present some uncomfortable truths.In short, Paul Mooney is a hero in the 'hood, as well he should be; and he need not be one anywhere else. He is UNIQUELY black--and ours...period."
1,release me from poor judgment,"read it because i bought the trilogy set. my bad x3. if you like anne rice don't read this junk, it'll tarnish your opinion of her writing ability. how could such a good story teller (vampires) miss all the fairytale and just write porn? stick to vampires anne...please."
3,Entertaining enough.,"The books sometimes dragged in repetitive detail. One was my least favorite, which is unusual. I found as I read more and more, I liked the third the best."
2,Wimpy ending to a weak effort,"Rice tries to pull all the lose ends together in the third book of her Beauty Trilogy but she honestly seems out of steam and spankings. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have read the other two books in the trilogy. Beauty and Tristan are kidnapped by a Sultan and his court, but the sexual games remain much the same with spanking as the primary focus of obedience and submission. The sex scenes remain repetitive and thus border on boring. Even after three books, Beauty remains very one dimensional, almost mentally retarded. There really is no plot, only situations for sexual encounters. The ending, where Beauty and Tristan are finally joined as husband and wife, King and Queen, is extremely weak and contrived. This series is the weakest product produced by Anne Rice. She should have trusted her characters to have some internal growth and change, some intelligence."
5,Anne Rice's erotica at it's best!,"This is the third and last instalment of the Beauty series, and, by far, the best. If you have gotten this far in the series, graphic S & M discriptions have probably gotten a bit less shocking and now it's time for a really good story. This is the book for that. Oh, you won't have to miss your quota of intensly-worded erotica, but the story is compelling enough not to have to skip pages of yet-more-sex to find it. And this book wraps up the series very nicely. It's a keeper, as are the other two books. But, be warned in advance, if hardcore erotica isn't what you're into, move on to her more recent offerings because this series isn't for the faint of heart or easily offended."
4,Oh what a tangled web we weave...,"PI Fritz Malone just went out to get some bagels. When the shooting starts, he becomes involved, attempting to chase down a gunman. He becomes involved in a complex case that is not going in the direction that anyone wanted. When he starts turning over stones, there are a lot of surprises.The case is interesting, at least enough to keep me reading. The main complaint that I had was that the author, at points, started sounding like the driver of a tour bus giving tourists a description of the city with historical footnotes added in. There was, perhaps, a little too much background color.The novel has some amount of violence and language, about what you would expect in a PI type novel, with minimal sexual content (mostly by reference). It tends to be written as a thriller novel."
4,Speak To Me,"Speak of the Devil spoke to me. Being a life-long resident of the New York Metropolitan area, I could more appreciate the vivid settings and enjoy the authentic, interesting characters that Richard Hawke sets to life on the pages of his debut thriller. Fritz Malone, a multi-dimensional personality with a dense history, seems not the spare creation of a first-timer, but rather the substantial one of a veteran writer (Harlan Coben comes to mind). Many of the ancillary characters seem poised to join center stage in what I hope will be a continuing series of hard-boiled crime novels. If so, I'll be interested in their stories and will find myself anticipating each new offering in this fledgling series."
2,Boring,"Very procedural, no emotional connection to any of the characters, if you are a fan of the genre avoid this, very dissapointing."
4,Tight Shot Transformer,The kids have been playing with Tight Shot for two days straight now. Seems to have good battery life and virtually indestructible. My 7 year old plays rough with his toys and Tight Shot seems to be holding up well.It's easy to hold but makes two noises only - a transforming noise and a charging main gun explosion noise.It transforms more than Flash Bang and has a much cooler explosion noise. It has more moving parts but might not be as indestructible as Flash Bang - only time will tell.
3,A little dated,"I never heard this recording when it was new. I used to hear the title track as theme material on some public radio news show years ago.It's fine music. Probably a precursor to new age, more than ""traditional"" jazz, for instance. It sounds like it wants to be all experimental and startling and original, and I'm sure it was when it was made. But, to me, it sounds a little dated this year.I'm sure I will continue to listen to this CD. Very nice instrumental music. It just kept bringing me ""back to Earth"" a little jarringly with the now-familiar musical cliches of the time."
4,Better than The Stranger,"More honest and less streamlined than The Stranger, this story will connect with the reader if his/her life has reached the point where small things have become both beautiful and final. I enjoyed it when I was 23, but was unprepared for how much I would love it even more at 37."
2,More of a completion piece,"This is something I think you read if you are truly into Albert Camus' progression as a writer. I don't believe a primer is needed to read ""The STranger,"" it is not very difficult to read. This story is not very sharp, but for a person in high school or younger, it's a great way to immerse yourself and progress as the writer did, starting with this novel."
3,Gallic aplomb and working class inventiveness,Somewhat overrated gallic get-back-at-the-bad-boss movie with point of view from partly deaf heroine providing some relief from the obligatory noisy night club scenes muted when she takes out her hearing aid - suspense is mainly due to wondering when the two are going to have it off and - typical of the working class -they do it in a car at the end of the movie when the hero has blood all over his face and we don't get to see anything. The hero also smokes a lot. Worth a watch but nothing to get really excited about.
1,Not accurate. Bought the Omron HEM-790IT instead.,"Though it got very good ratings on a number of websites, I found that it gave consistently high readings. Unfortunately, I waited to long to return it and am now stuck with it. I did not realize until I got back to the Doctor that the reading were unreliable. It gave readings that were consistently 15 points high in the systolic and 10 points high in the diastolic. The Omron is right on. You should avoid this unit."
2,A disappointing purchase,"I bought this monitor to replace another brand of auto-inflate monitor purchased at a drugstore. The old monitor had been very accurate, but died suddenly and was not repairable. The LifeSource UA-787 is easy to use but is at least 20 points higher on both the systolic and diastolic measurements when compared with blood pressure readings done at the doctor's office."
2,Consistently higher reading than our physician's,"This product is easy to use but seems to result in consistently higher reading than I get at my physician's office. As long as I see it is consistent, it's OK, but I know others have returned their monitors for this reason."
3,Customer service,"I never knew when the items were shipped. When I checked it always said shipping soon, maybe it was an Amazon gliche. But the seller could have responsed to the emails so I would have known the products were shipped and not waiting to be shipped as inidicated in open orders."
1,"If it was free, I wouldn't use it.!","Definitely a waste, no help at all. Crank up your Microsoft word and get a book called ""How to say It...In your job search"" by Robbie Miller Kaplan. Now that is worth every penny!"
4,mini tab,"come on time, work well so far, very happy, happy happy happy happyhappy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy.Thanks"
5,"The above review should have been a seller feedback, not a review of the item.","The above review should have been a seller feedback, not a review of the item. This stereo is good for entry level and the price."
1,pitiful,The radio came incomplete it was missing the power and speaker cable with which to use it in your vehicle. Buyer be ware of this seller. This radio sucked.
4,Knights & Castles 50 Hands-On Activites to Experience the Middle Ages,"If you are willing to gather the materials, there are lots of project ideas in this book. I teach middle school and purchased this book in hopes of finding a couple of ideas to enhance my unit on King Arthur. There are also lots of fun historical facts in the book. I especially like the section about Medieval names and their meanings."
1,Poor Richard,"As I was dozing off lightly while reading this book, I thought I sensed a fleeting glimpse of Richard Bach's editor. ""Richard"", I thought I heard her say, ""We haven't had a book from you in five years and your contract says you owe us one more by the end of 2000."" What happened next I truly must have dreamed, but I almost thought I heard Richard respond that he had something in the attic he had started, maybe they could just publish the first few chapters and call it a book..."
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,"I have read all of Richard Bach's books. This one is a real looser. If you want to read it, go to the library, pull it off the shelf (I am sure no one checked it out), stand there, read it & put it back on the shelf. It will just take a few minutes......wasted minutes......but just a few of them. Don't waste your money.It is my opinion that Bach is only after the $. If you don't believe me, check out his web site!"
3,Look for what IS NOT there..,"I'm also a big fan of RB's books and in a few first moments I was disappointed.. but seeing this book in the context of his other work makes it interesting! This book is about things it's not about, to put it in a little confusing manner. Do you see Leslie there? Where's she gone? This tiny work might give you more answers about looking for a soulmate and living with them without saying a single word about this topic.... just give it a thought :-)"
3,A bit disappointing,"I love Richard Bach's work. However, reading Out Of My Mind was a bit of a surprise, because after I had finished it, I felt as if I wasn't done. The book did not read like a finished product; instead, it felt like a first or second draft, with underdeveloped characters and a general lack of cohesiveness. It is a short work (around 100 pages), but a novella can still have a sense of arrival at the end (like Illusions or Jonathan Livingston Seagull, for instance).One can argue that the story isn't supposed to ""end,"" that the journey of discovering parallel universes and interacting with people from the past doesn't have to stop, and that Bach intended the ending to have this open, unfinished feeling. However, I don't feel it is crafted as meticulously as his other works.If you want to read Richard Bach, I suggest The Bridge Across Forever and Illusions first, then JLS, One and Running from Safety. Don't start with Out Of My Mind."
4,Find your Saunders-Vixen,"Is that where ideas come from? Can such small choices result in such different consequences? How can so few words mean so much?I was given this book as a Xmas present and read it in less than a day. It still lingers with me and although I do not yet understand its full meaning, there is an uneasy call to arms within my head summoning me to take ownership of and understand the consequences of the choices I have.I have not read anything else of Bach's works, I may well do now. If ever I am flying in my Piper Club (with the door open) I will wonder what Dyer, Chopra and Ziglar would say about the view."
5,"My Dream is to meet Mr.Richard Bach, is a miracle possible:)","One day, one beautiful day I hope to have the chance to play a game of chess with Mr.Bach and pay him a beer...... what a dreamer, hey that's life!!!!!"
4,Worth the price?,"I have a beaten down 4-cell and a bruised 3-cell flash lights that have seen so much action they're now rubbed down to the aluminum and look more silver than black. The problem has always been with the bulbs - I've spent more money replacing the bulbs than the original flashlights were worth. No more though - I've upgraded both with LED lights. The beam is focused and bright, EVEN with old batteries. Pretty happy overall, though one might consider getting the whole thing brand new for only $10-15 more. Or you can be cheap like me =)"
5,"Bright light, less power","Toss your old bulb and replace it with this LED. Replacement is trivial - just swap the bulbs. The result is a bright light, and greatly enhanced battery life. Nice!"
5,So much for the wind.,"I looked everywhere for tablecloth weights. I decided to look at Amazon. Sure enough, they had them. I ordered two sets and they are so cute. The wind doesn't have a chance with these cute weights on the tablecloth. They are very high quality and cute too. I love them."
1,Not worth the paper it is written on,One of the worst books I have ever read!! I expected so much more from the Thoenes'. I don't think I will be reading the rest of this series....
3,Fun...but takes a bit of maintenance,"We bought the rainbow one for our 4-year old daughter. The ball took a while to pop up the first time but this is stated in the instructions so no surprise there. Once it ""warmed up"" it would pop up after 2 to 3 seconds. Read the instructions thoroughly again and decided to run it under water. After doing so, the suction cups would stick together for a good 15 seconds with no throwing around. The more you throw it, the less it would stick together. Overall, it's a fun purchase if you just like to play outdoors with ANYTHING...which is what we like to do. It's different and can definitely be enjoyed with a good imagination."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"I am quite a Scofield fan and he does a fine job on the ablum. Lovano is also quite a formidable beast of a player. The problem that I have is the slight weakness that Al Foster provides on the album. Not that he isn't good, its just that he kind of gets in the way but thats just my opinion. Definately a great buy though. Go ahead and get it."
5,"Loved it, highly recommend to read it",I loved everything about this book and in general all her writings.
1,A promise unfulfilled,"I approached this book looking forward to an insightful and thought-provoking book, given the rich context of the setting and events. By the end, I was skimming it, completely disappointed in its bias and superficial treatment of current events. It is a political diatribe cloaked in a formulaic and weak coating of ""literature."" The characters are one-dimensional and the plot, predictable."
1,Not Worth It,"Unfortunately I had to pick 1 Star to rate this book, because there were no 0 stars, which it trully deserved. Very boaring and very lacking in the craft of writing this book is. Not to mention how biased and brain washing a tool it trully is. Save your money and donate it to Katrina Victims, that would be way more rewarding than wasting your time with reading this book!"
1,Bad Computer Illustrations,I should've looked more closely at this book before buying it for my one-year old. The illustrations are really terrible. There is a pig in a wig that is particularly awful -- and sort of frightening! This book is just not worth buying.
4,Live Cannibalism,"This is a good live album. You can hear everyone in the band playing their instruments and Cannibal even manage to play fan favorites like ""I ""c** blood"", and of course ""Hammer Smashed Face"". This is good for fans that can't make it to one of their shows."
3,Packaging very poor,"The nuts are fresh, but they arrived completely spilled out of their plastic containers and rolling around the shipping box. They need to be sealed inside their containers for shipment."
4,"cute, doesnt ""play"" well with thomas","i like this train set. i purchased it for my 3 year old daughter, and she loves it, as expected. in playing with it though, i find it doesnt hook up as well to the thomas cars she has, so she has to play with one set or the other, which, her being 3, pretty much guarantees i have to play with her or separate them out ahead of time. the animals are cute, and overall i do like it, just be aware of the not connecting well issue. i also noted that when you have the track set up to go under the risers (i.e. overpass) the animals have to get out of the train, they are too tall."
4,Nice for the price...,"This is a sweet little set.Note that there are only two riding cars for animals, but three animals provided. The elephant is dark blue with black ink so it's quite hard to see.The standard 'Brio' compatible track works with these, but the engine, caboose, and cars holding the provided zoo animals are too tall to fit under standard wooden bridges. The wheels/axles are a bit cheap compared to other 'Brio' compatible trains we have from Ikea, but will probably be just fine with gentle play."
1,Doesn't even deserve to be read,"Seeing how I am forced to attend an evanglical church every week, I found this to be more of the same. Fundamentalist Christians are extraordinarily biased as usual and manage to blast the innocent UU church which has done nothing but help people and just be decent.Indeed... UU's have not claimed to be ""christian"" since 1960--and before that, they explicitly talked about God and Jesus and such in their statement of beliefs."
3,Amazing Stories,"Where we were excited to have a clear,clean copy of these awesome ""short movies""....... we were disapointed thatFamily Dog was not among the first season collection. Seeing as it has now been well over 25+ years since these treasureswere viewed on TV, they have lost a little of their ""punch"" but, we have aged,too - perhaps not as well as the series!Like any older movie or series, the memories that are brought forward while viewing this DVD, are priceless. Enjoy!"
4,Occasionally silly,"""Uneven"" is the word that comes to mind in describing this. Some of the episodes are excellent, such as ""The Mission."" Others are not very good at all. Fortunately the good episodes outnumber the bad. The bad ones are caused by hackneyed plots, an attempt to be ""cute."" In one, a precursor to ""ET"" a space alien is befriended by children who help him go home. There are some that suggest Spielberg's ""The Duel,"" much better as a movie.Still, these are worth a look."
3,This album has it's place,If you're a Jim Croce fan(atic) you should get this album to complete your collection. But it was poorly mixed/recorded to the point where even rank amateurs like me get annoyed. I love the types of songs here and I loved Jim's music so I'm glad I got it but the production values really are a pebble in your shoe while you're listening.
2,Not much on knots,The book has some neat knots but not very much for the begginer. The section on globe knots doesn't tell how to work the sphere into the center and a few diagrams are wrong (pg 141 step one-two). Bud ford mentions the Ashley Book of knots way to much. Mabe you would be better of with that book than his
3,"great selection of knots, hard to follow step by step illustrations","This book has a great selection of decorative knots, and if you are already well experienced with tying some of these knots then this book is probably perfect. However, if you are just learning how to tie most of these knots and need a good step by step illustration to follow this is KNOT the book for you. the illustrations are nice, but not very well explained. they seem to jump over steps and can be confusing."
4,Pretty knots,"Seller I give a 100%. The book is awesome. Perfect condition. This book is for anyone who has picked up the hobby, has had this hobby, or just interested in nice looking knots. Thanks. It makes a good addition to my library."
4,Decorative knots,"Very good book, well illustrated, easy to follow if your a novice. Delivered on time and as promised."
4,good,"Just was I was expecting it to be. Very strong leash. I love the dive flags, perfect for any diver."
1,Too Much Like a Home Movie. A Badly Made Home Movie.,"Too many dead end dramatics. Not enough proper lighting when it was necessary to see what was happening on screen.I never quite understand why a plot is hidden. No explaination as to why things are happening to the characters. The dialog was muffeled and I found the sub-titles were way too small for my old eyes. Not a great combination for keeping up with a difficult storyline. The heavy breathing, panting and gasping for air was constant and very annoying.In one final burst of action, POOF... the movie was over and done. I'm really not sure what happened. Is there a Part 2?"
2,Skip This Book,"As I started reading this book, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between this book and Internet Slave Master by John Glatt. So similar, in fact, that I thought I was reading the same book again. I didn't really like Internet Slave Master nor did I like this one. This book had nothing new to say. John Robinson was a businessman, Eagle Scout and Man of the Year. Very few people knew the real John Robinson. Three quarters of the book deals with the prior crimes committed by John. He was always setting up new businesses and trying to get people to invest. Each time the police caught him, he would start up another business. Eventually he moved his scams to the internet to lure women. This book was a waste of time."
3,author gets side-tracked,Mindhunter was fantastic. This book by the same author was mediocre.Topic and research were 5 star. Like some previous reviewers I found that at times the author got long winded on side topics. Needs to stay more on track than this book was.
2,Disappointing photo prints,"I have been using this printer for about a month, and I have been disappointed with the photo's I've printed. The printer seems to have problems with flesh tones and shaded areas, causing red or black speckles to appear in the photograph, usually on people's faces. I just bought an HP photosmart 1100, and I'm having no such problems with it. It's more money, but it's worth it."
3,Perfectly Solid. Not great but not bad.,Well. I don't know this book seems to be about how the Dark Queens armies were created and got together. It's a well written book over all but not really must read material. It's kinda slow... a little predictable and boring in some spots. Overall just solid. Not what I expected for the commander of all the Dark Queens armies though. Oh well.
5,Just the right thing,We needed something to combat mosquitoes in our flower pots. These dunks worked perfect. Thanks for a great product that works.
5,These are great!,"I use these not only for what they are intended for, but in the fall when I bring in my outdoor plants, I have always had a problem with fungus gnats. (They are like small fruit flies, that multiply very fast!) I now put some of these Mosquito Bits in a gallon of water and use that to water those plants before they come in and for a while after and no more gnats! It gets rid of the larvae hiding in the soil. A big thumbs up for this product!"
4,As good as it looks!,"Deck is a nice quality, shuffles easily. The artwork is outstanding, just edgy enough but not too overboard, meaning everyone has been comfortable with it for readings.The deck ""speaks"" clearly. The only drawback is the tiny little book that accompanies it. Had more time been spent on it, I'd give it 5 stars. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase!"
2,beautiful but a bit dull,"The Gothic Tarot has some beautiful imagery, but I found a bit too repetive. I don't think I could use it as an effective tool for doing tarot readings-but I did intend to use it as a prop for a Vampire larp, & in that respect it will make a perfect bit of furnishing!"
2,Not my kind of deck,Honestly I didn't care for this deck for a lot of reasons. First the imagary felt flat and didn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm sorry to say this because it had a lot of potential too bad it failed to deliver.
2,Didn't fit a stock Toyota 3K distributor,"As the title says. According to Amazon's car selector this fits a 3K Toyota stock engine. Well, it doesn't. The base is bigger than the distributor.Also, the embossed numbers you see in the pictures are not there. Not a deal-breaker but still, the picture is not accurate.The product seems to be of good quality, but wasn't even able to install it. Buy only if you're 100% sure it fits, don't trust Amazon's car selector."
5,So Magnificent. Life changing...,"Any positive comment listed here I endorse as I am in full agreement that Dream On is one of the best artifacts of those heady days of 90s TV.I write here for this reason only: Please PLEASE give us the later seasons! If only for download that's fine - we'll pay. We need them. Though the show did taper out slightly in later episodes, leaving a show of this splendor unfinished in the archive and in the available canon is artistic heresy and entertainment brutality."
5,GOOD CASSETTE DECK,BOUGHT THIS CASSETTE DECK TO REPLACE A 22 YEAR OLD PIONEER TAPE DECK. REALLY LIKE HOW FF & REW WILL TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT SONG. SOUNDS GREAT EVEN WITH MY CASSETTES WHICH ARE GETTING PRETTY OLD THEMSELVES. ALSO LIKE HAVING THE HEADPHONE PLUG. WOULD BUY AGAIN.
5,A Story that must be told,This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter.
4,Pretty good protection,"For the money, this little bag is nice. It could use a little stiffer sides and some semi rigid protection for the face and strings."
3,Mid-80s Compilation,"This is a recent release but does not contain any new material. It's another compilation of songs from Peter Green's 80s solo albums. Hardcore Green fans will likely have these tracks on the original albums; those who are interested will be better served by the vastly superior ""Green and Guitar"" compilation. (Note: both of these collections chicken out and use a ""young"" picture of Peter when he was still in Fleetwood Mac. At the time these songs were recorded he already looked older and was starting to lose his hair. So much for truth in advertising...)"
2,Chedmaster Barbeque Tool Set - 19 Pieces,"This picture of this set looked and the write-up sounded appealing. When I received it, I felt like I'd purchased something from a ""Ronco Infomercial"". The thin cardboard around the bbq case says $65.00 value for only $30.00. Personally, my paying $30.00 was a mistake. Product is just a tad bit cheesy. Don't think it would last a long time. I was planning on giving it as a gift to someone, but have returned it instead. Oh well....we shoot & miss sometimes! :)"
1,tools are made for midgets,the tools are made with cheap wood measuring in a total length of 8 inches including the flipper. Speaking of the flipper you should order 2 sets of these tools cause you will need to use two flippers to flip a quarter lb burger. If you REALLY like sliders this set will work cause thats about all you can flip. Haven't even mentioned the corn holders which are duller than a plastic spoon and skewers that bend when you put a strawberry on it. item returned same day it was delivered.
2,Not for the serious investor,"The book was short, light and easy to read. It was also a very superficial treatment of the topic, more of a cheerleading tome than anything else. If you want hard numbers/facts, look elsewhere."
2,"Cool film, horrible DVD","I agree with the previous review. This is a very cool film of the early 70's, clearly designed to promote Evel and his planned jump of the Grand Canyon (he had to settle for the Snake River Canyon in Idaho instead.) But this is quite simply the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen. The video quality is terrible. For a few bucks you might consider snatching this up, but don't expect much quality wise. On the other hand, this is my favorite George Hamilton performance, although he doesn't really look like Evel, he really nails the performance. John Milius co-wrote the script early in his career."
1,Evel fans can jump over this release.,"I purchased this DVD because I had hoped it might include a remastered or at least watchable release of the EVEL KNIEVEL movie. It does not! In my opinion, its only value is in the reproduction of the original poster art on its cover. The American Daredevil Icon and his fans deserve better."
4,Mr. Iggy was....,"....far more articulate than the New York Dolls or KISS when it came to the hard-core Glitter Rock scene. If David Bowie was willing to work with this man, he's worth a listen!!!!!!!!!!!! Try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Whatever you do...STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!,Without a doubt this is the worst game ever made. I rented this game for five days and took it back the second. The only thing this game is good at is poking fun at the very serious issues of 9/11 and the War in Iraq(You have to kickbox Osama Bin Laden to win the game). This game is pathetic and sad. To give this game a chance would be like spitting in the U.S.A.'s face. So please I beg you...Stay Away!!!
2,I wasn't sold.,"I've lived in Washington all my life and spent many a boring hour on the fine ferry boats here and when I read this book I just really couldn't buy that the plan would work. For one, ferries are too high profile a target. Why steal one when you could get a good sea going tug boat out of the ship canal, taking a couple of Norweigans from Ballard, or Fremont hippies as hostages while you are at it. Secondly, the Marines at Bangor are more on the ball than portrayed in this book. It is highly unlikely that a boomer would be able to be hijacked from right under their noses without more than a few pistol shots exchanged. Sorry Dick, I just didn't buy the premise."
3,Old Skool Soundin Trax,"I didn't know these would be old skool soundin trax. I was surprised. There not bad songs, just not what I expected. IDK if this is a compilation or what."
3,Natas,sup to all the esham fans in the world.the cds cool but wheres the incest song that was some funny stuff.
4,Forensic Dentistry,A great book for the uninitiated. The book opens the world of forensic dentistry to the general dentist and health professional.
4,very pleasant,"This is a lovely book. It gives a lot of garden advice, just between the lines.I will read this over and over."
5,Prompt service,"The book arrived in condition as described and delivery was extremely fast, sooner than I expected since it was during the holidays - very nice since the book was a gift."
4,SOLID,"I've had this printer for probably ten years! (Well, I have the Cse version, but not really any different). It's solid. As long as I give it some new ink every once in a while, it just keeps on going! There are probably much newer, better, faster printers out there now, but this one is a workhorse!"
3,Update for Old Panama Red,Have had the vinyl version of this record since the album was issued back in the day. Decided it was time to update to a CD as it is worth listening to on today's systems. Not all songs are equal but many will make you tap your toe.
3,What was once entertaining...,"I listened to a lot of this type of stuff in high school. I think it's an okay album but one grows tired of the many cheesy drug references. The two songs on the album that I think have stood the test are the ones that have little flash compared to the signature numbers on the album. ""Teardrops in my Eye"" is a cover an old Red Allen country number. It works fine on this album. ""Cement, clay and glass"" a song about urban sprawl was appropos in the 70s and is so now.I tip my hat to Jerry for prodding his pals to do some country. I'm glad this album was made and I listened to it a lot in the 70s. I'll likely enjoy an occasional track should I ever hear them somewhere but only some of the album has stood the test of time."
2,and i thought it was all nashville's fault,"the state of country rock that is or what passes for it these days. you know what i mean. the artificial, boring, dumb songs that come out of nashville. it turns out the demise may have started in L.A. long ago. this cd is a perfect example of it. although somewhat commercially successful this band was very artistically challenged. bad singing, dumb sentiments, many songs about chicks that done 'em wrong. the whole lousy package (and somewhat wimpy to boot). and i thought it was all nashville's fault. it turns out it was also jerry garcia's fault, who helped give these guys their start. where's a new gram parsons or ronnie van zant when you need them?"
1,Very Crappy,"I bought this and found that it has about the same resolution as a $80 scanner with 5 Buttons. I would reccomend no one to buy this because you can't run it on Windows 98 or Mac OS 8, so Don't buy it. For those of you who did buy it along with myself I should warn you!"
3,"Sexy, comfortable, but beware...","I really like this underwear. CK designed it well, and the fabric feels and fits great. I would give it 5 stars except for one thing:I own about 4 pairs. 1 of the pairs is ""made in Israel"". It fits perfectly.The other three are ""made in Egypt"". The inseam is much shorter (>1in shorter) and it feels tight in the groin. They feel like a hip brief, but with too much material.I wrote to CK, but so far nothing. I'm hoping that the Israeli version is the correct version because I really like them."
5,Excellent album,"Jeff Beck, Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice: Beck Bogert Appice: This is an excellent album. There are only a couple of songs here that got radio airplay, but the whole album is very good. This one shows Jeff Beck at his best. Five Stars"
2,This really isnt all that great,"I admit I have enjoyed this album, there is some good playing. The recording will not impress audiophiles and the vocals are awfull. Still, it seems to get going at some points, and this is beacuse these guys are pretty accomplished musicians.Listen before you buy. Buyer beware. After a few years of listening I cant listen to this anymore. It really falls apart...and the vocals will cause anyone who is not actively listening (ie someone next door) go crazy.Also..check to see if my review on Paice, Ashton, Lord's ""Malice in Wonderland"" review is available...with some references and comparisons to this forgettable album.These artists have done so much better."
4,Jeff Beck Finds Some Mates to Play the Blues,"This disc sounds dated. The good news is it was recorded by some major players back in the day. Jeff Beck was becoming a guitar ""god"" at the time and he was able to coax a couple of mates from the band Vanilla Fudge to play with him while he gave them equal credit in the name of the band as long as his name came first. If you have never heard Beck's version of the song he wrote for Stevie Wonder ""Superstition"" than this is a must have. The second tune ""Lady"" sounds like Cream hands down. The blues was the type of music which was popular with so many bands in this time period and was a good vehicle for showcasing the guitar for Jeff Beck and Jeff does it well here. - Ciao"
4,Good but predictable,"I enjoyed this erotic book for the first half but after that, the plot became a little predictable and the main character's escapades became a little unbelievable. If anything, this book was a good escape from the norm."
5,All U Can Eat Review (1/30/12),This book was amazing. I love how the author describes the characters and the scenes. I wish it had had a little bit more of a drama scenario. I hope the author writes a sequel
2,Nearly useless,"I bought this DVD on spec, hoping it would be a good DVD to follow. I was disappointed.Negative points:- The women in the video aren't pregnant. It actually made me wonder about the quality of the moves presented.- It was quite fast in the instructions given. They were voiced over and there was no close-up of the positions to help guide you along.- It claims to have a beginner and intermediate level program, but the difference between the two is so slight I would really call it false advertising.- As others said, not much of a workout. I stretched my back out nicely, but that's about it.Positive points:+ Was 20 minutes long, which is what I wanted. I wanted something short and snappy. Unfortunately the contents didn't live up to it.I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Terrible On Both Counts,"I received this as a gift right after I had given birth and I tried the post-natal workout at 7 weeks post-partum. While not all that difficult, something in there ended up hurting my abs more than childbirth. But, again, the annoying woman on the dvd is not and most likely has not ever been pregnant. I just tried the pre-natal session and it is just lame, not worth even commenting on further."
2,I wouldn't call this a workout at all,"I was sorely disappointed in this DVD. I just finished it and hardly even feel like I had a good stretch, let alone a workout. Just when I thought we would be getting into some of the good stuff, she thanks me for joining her and it was over. Really? I was hoping that I could find a pilates DVD help me with my sciatic pain. This is not it. I have done pilates in the past and I enjoyed having my butt kicked. I will now do some research to find a GOOD pilates workout DVD for myself. Just because I am pregnant does not mean I am fragile and can't workout.Someone else mentioned that it was annoying to watch two skinny women doing a prenatal workout and I couldn't agree more. Throw a preggo in there or at least stuff a soccer ball up someone's shirt."
5,Wish I could Date Judy.,"A Date with Judy is a fluffy-fun movie.Jane Powell is cute and sings beautifully.Both ""It's a Most unuaully"" and ""Strictly on the corny side"" are well done.A Date with Judy started out as a radio series ,1942-1950.Louise Erickson played Judy from 1944 until the end of series.Richard Crenna played her boyfriend, Oggie.Unlucky for us most of the radio episodes are missing.But of the surviving handfull of episodes that are some gems to listen too.My favorite being the guest appearance by Frank Sinatra."
1,Very disapointing Service.,"I ordered this DVD on 18th December 2011,and was looking forward to receiving itin January 2012.I have been trying to get this film for many months,but it has beenvery pricey in the past.I noticed in December that it was being offered at 11.99Dollars so I ordered it straight away.I waited over 5 weeks for it to arrive,andwas very disapointed because it didn't show up.I told Amazon recently that I was"" Fed Up "" of waiting,and would like a refund,which they say they have done.I have purchased many items from Amazon U.S and U.K.in the past without any delivery problems,and this is the first time I have been completely let down.(And no reason given.)David Martin"
2,Bubble Gum,"This is one I should have left alone. I knew of course by the product description that it wasn't what oscar's are made of, but I went ahead and bought it because I like June Allyson and Lucille Ball. Big Mistake--no matter who's in it, this is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Watched it once (which was a struggle)and gave it away. Almost any other June Allyson or Lucille Ball movie has to be better than this one. Not worth your time or your money."
2,A flawed comedy,"Though I am a fan of Lucille Ball movies, I found this movie to be quite dull and overacted. I don't know why a director would think that the particular hijinks of the college boys in this film would be entertaining. The inept acting or comedic timing was distracting though the storyline was anticipated to be promising. I feel I wasted my money on this DVD."
5,thunderous applause,"This is a who's-who of great pieces of music you have heard all of your life, and never knew the names and stories! I listened to it over and over in the car and had my own concert! A friend borrowed it to add music to his Home Movies and it was perfect!"
4,"Beautiful Music, but short","These works are all very beautiful and energizing, however I would have preferred to have the whole song of each work on the CD. Instead they took the most robust part of each piece and played it for three minutes. For me, it detracts from the beauty or energy of the song, but for others who may not want to listen to the whole song, it is very well put together."
1,not good,the movements on the dvd and the voice over did not match up so for a beginer it was a bit confusing
3,It does not looks like vinyl,"The main idea when purchasing such paper sheets, is to print own stickers/labels, that look like professionally manufactured ones. While durability/strength/overall quality of these sheets is OK, it's appearance is NOT ok. It is not glossy as you should expect, but it's quite matte, vinyl is coated with special material, on which you'll print using your printer. So, if you need, glossy, factory-like vinyl labels, search for another material."
5,Great for preschool hands!,"We use these at our preschool, they are just like the quality pencils used by the grown ups, just chubby sized to help develop develop those fine motor skills!"
2,"Low speed is way to fast, pooly designed beaters","This is a heavy and powerful mixer. Power is great, but power and rotational speed are different things. There is no reason for the lowest speed to be so high that it flings ingredients out of the bowl. They need to gear it down so that it doesn't spin so fast or change the motor design. The beaters are very poorly designed for mixing ingredients. I've used Kitchenaid and even cheap (less than $10) mixers that would beat lumps of brown sugar in a batter better than this one. These beaters manage to shoot the lumps right through, over and over again. I use a spoon to mash the soft lumps and continue. I could sift everything of course, but shouldn't have to."
4,Very Pleased,"I just got a new laptop and needed a case for it, i looked online and this looked like the best buy. I was not dissapointed. I put my laptop in it after i use it every night and i know nothing will happen in it (like scratches or dents, ect.)I even put it under my laptop when i have it on my lap for when it gets a little hot."
3,Good wear and light weight but....,"Purchased a pair of these last year. Great hiker, light weight, good grip sole. Used almost daily for light trails. The only complaint is the material that covers the rear shank,(behind your heal/achilles, has worn through exposing the plastic shank which left the shoes unwearable. This could be solved if bit more padding or double over the material could solve this issue. Would I purchase again, yes."
1,"Fair for Short day hikes, Worthless for anything else.","I bought these shoes a year ago and have taken them out on hikes ranging from a few hours to a 6 day backpacking trip in Colorado. Overall I would say that the construction is very poor. After a few months of hiking in these the soles started to separate and the stitching started to come undone. The insole is no better than a thin sheet of cardboard would be and had to be replaced immediately. At one time Merrell's made good shoes, but the construction and cutting corners has made their shoes good for short hikes and maybe yard work. For me, these shoes were pitched in the trash after I took them on a six day backpacking trip in Colorado. These shoes ruined my trip by causing several blisters and bruises. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone."
2,Neurotics never learn...,"Anyone who truly seeks a human point of view on healing would be much better off reading the works of Arthur Janov, which present solutions of a more real and humane perspective compared to the neurotic symbolism of psychedelic therapists turned right-wing occultists."
4,Comfy Bed for Critters,"My daughter's Calico Critters seem to enjoy these bunk beds. My daughter has no complaints, either! The furniture is nicely detailed and a great buy for populating a doll house, whether for Calico Critters or for other doll house residents."
1,NO Closed Captions!,"I love this show, but I am hearing impaired and there are NO closed captions! For $270 you would think they could think of the hearing impaired!"
5,Very good product,"I like this soap as it is mild, but cleans and removes makeup as well as any ""makeup remover"" and is not drying to the skin. I also like that it is not perfumed. On first opening the package it had a strong smell, but that dissipated quickly and now has a nice & mild ""soap"" smell."
5,Keeps you looking young!,"My skin is extremely allergic and this vitamin E soap was recommended to me years ago. I started washing my face with it at least 2x a day. I have oily on T-Zone (only forehead, nose and chin)and dry on the sides of the face. Not only did I not have an allergic reaction but this soap cleared my face, left my skin smooth throughout and removes the shiny oily feel. The bonus was that while women my age are showing wrinkles, my face appears the same after years of using this product. I have recommended it to many friends and they all have great feedback. This product is amazing for the price - I only pray it never gets discontinued!"
3,OK Game BUT there must be better ways to spend time...,"After playing for a week I'm bored, and on the DS screen the cars are the size of ants.It's an OK game, but I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. If it is true, that according to all DS reviews, this is one of the better games, why do people with a brain bother? Life is interesting and sometimes exciting. Mario Cart is like sticking your head in a little box and thinking you are actually using it."
3,Fun But Big Battery User,"I really enjoyed playing this game but found that if I left the unit on it ate up battery life like there was no tomorrow. I actually thought something was wrong with my existing battery or the DS itself because the battery took forever to get any charge on it and once it did, the charge unloaded in a matter of an hour or so.Once I took the game out and installed a different one, the DS (and its battery) performed normally."
3,Mario Cart,This was for my grandson and he's 9 years old. He'll have to rate it for you. He seems to enjoy it.
3,I like milk (almond),I Bought this game readlng the other revues thinking It was good. It wasent(after i it alot).You should get this game if you like racers.
5,Mario Kart action meets DS features.,"Mario Kart:Super Circuit just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the graphics, or the tracks..I'm not sure. What I am sure of is that this game is great. Grand Prix mode has a lot to it and can get quite challenging (150 cc) and VS mode allows you to practice on any track or tracks you want. Multiplayer is a ton of fun, with frantic racing as well as the Balloon Battle and Shine Runners games. UP TO 8 PEOPLE CAN PLAY WITH ONE GAME CARD! Multi-card play is also supported. Of course, the cardinal feature that everyone is talking about is online play. Nintendo did a really great job with the interface, the only things to be desired are the ability to match up to people of your choice and a lobby area where gamers can chat. Aside from those things, the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection makes it easy and fun to take your game online. This is the best DS game I have played so far, and I think it is a must for all DS owners.Did I mention the great 3D graphics?"
2,Fun!,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son to play on his DS Lite. He had gotten Super Mario Bros. and loved it so I thought Mario Kart would be the next logical game in the succession. It is a little harder for him to play so for those who are novices with the DS or very young like he is, expect some frustration. But for those who have a good handle on game play it falls in line with the rest of the classic Super Mario games."
5,Its a Blast,"I got Mario Kart DS for my DS XL and love it, the game is fun and a easy way to spend an afternoon or when ever you have a bit of free time."
5,Love this book,Great story. My daughter orginally brought a copy of the book home from the Library. I liked it so much I bought it for myself. The cake receipe is pretty darn good.
5,My New Favorite Cake,I'm a teacher and I picked up this book to teach character development. It's a lovely story with two fun characters. I've used it with older kids who are learning English and they all really enjoy it. The cake recipe in the back is fantastic! It's my new favorite kind of cake.
4,Touching - and funny - story.,"I remember this book from when it was featured in Cricket magazine :)When the old baker dies, nobody can fill her shop - mostly because she haunts them.But, true to form, another baker shows up willing to challenge the ghost. Finally they agree that if the live baker can bake a cake to bring tears to her eyes, the old one will leave her alone.In the process they become friends, etc. etc. etc.It's very well-written, no summary of mine could ever do it justice.I will note that it is a long book, and so is probably better for the older end of the 4-8 range, or kiddos with good attention spans. (Cricket divided the book into sections.)"
4,Great DE razor!!!,Formerly used Parker 86R DE razor with mixed results.The adjustment feature on this razor allows you to be as timid or aggressive as you wish during your shaving passes. The razor feels very solid in hand. The complaints of it having an awkward blade changing mechanism and angle adjustment are warranted but are easily remedied by just being extra careful. I find I can change a blade safely and easily in 20-25 seconds - do you really need a NASCAR pit stop blade change? Well worth the money for this razor.
4,Great price and good product...size is a bit over the top,"Literally, the top is HUGE...but I am willing to put up with that to have the versatility of the inverter including household plugs. Never know when electricity will go out in the house and need to maybe use/charge a medical appliance or meet some other emergency need on a trip. Not easy to find at this price and still get some reliable service!"
5,His BEST by far,"I've got all Satch's DVDs as I'm a huge fan. His soloing here is unmatched by any of the others. Joe is always amazing, but on these discs I noticed at once a level of stylistic maturity only hinted at on previous discs. He stretches out a little more and effortlessly plays more melodic and more sophisticated ideas than what I'm used to hearing from him.The variety of tunes is especially good too. You'll get your old faves and plenty more from Joe's expansive past offerings. The video and sound quality are excellent too.If I could only own one Satch video, this would be it. No question."
3,show bom,"Joe satriani é um ótimo guitarrista recomendável para músicos iniciantes, o blu-ray chegou de forma rápida e em perfeito estado"
2,No Drivers for Vista(64),"What good is a high-speed audio interface if it won't work with current software? To me, very litle.It works OK with my Dell XPS laptop for field recording on the road, but is usless in the studio. So I get about 10% value out of the hardware."
3,Very Dissapointing,"It sucks when you expect a lot from a guy who's about to come out with a debut album. I-20's ""Self-explanatory"" isn't that bad...but he could've done better and he didn't. I feel that this album was rushed and now it's garbbage. If you love DTP, you'll know what I mean when you hear this album."
3,Its a Coo 1st album,See I-20 is smarter than Chingy...Stay with one of the kings of the South which is Ludacris and you will be prosper also. Chingy is dumb he isn't going to be anything with Ludacris...Hopefully I-20 will be loyal and ride with Ludacris to the top...I-20 is tight cause DTP is nice! Break bread is nice song to bump....Good decent album i-20!
1,"No, Writing is Your Weakness","An East Coast writer moves to the American West and completely overlooks the fact that millions of women who already live here do, in fact, hunt, fish, hike, ski, raft, and climb - just as men do. Moreover it is typically done with more knowledge, skill and interesting conversation about it than is offered by this tennis camp prima donna who simply refuses to get over herself."
1,Displayed incorrect on the web site,This costume would have probably been OK except it is written up incorrectly on the web site. It is stated that a Medium is a 8-10 but when received it actually was check marked a 5-7 as a Medium and 8-10 would be considered a Large. Needs to be corrected on the web site so more people don't waste their time receiving and paying for the wrong size.
5,Totally enjoyable!,"I loved reading this book for its well paced, subtle humor and simple, true theme. There seems to be a rash of books dealing with some of the key questions about life these days and I happen to agree with the conclusions in this one. If you thought ""The 5 people you meet in Heaven"" has the right take on life you may not appreciate the message this book is delivering but it would be worth you reading anyway, if only for the quirky, clever writing! One of my favorites this year..."
2,Fast Food for the Soul,"If you like your reading fast and easy, then this book is for you! 338 large typed pages of superficial dreck, thinly disguised as a ""new-age"" parable. I kept imagining someone I knew had written this, their first novel. Buy it used and set aside part of an afternoon for this completely forgettable, albeit sweet, story."
2,Disappointing and tedious,"This particular game began with promise of excitement and challenge, but got old very quickly. I found myself frustrated and bored. I finally had to resort to cheat notes on the web, and was relieved to get to the end of the game. With all of that brain power and creative genius behind this game, my feeling is they could have done much much better. I would suggest not settling for gaming that is this mediocre!"
3,Science of Love,"Madame Curie is part science part love story. Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon are teamed up again, and while Garson seems to carry the show (after all it is about Madame Curie)the story focuses upon a genuine love story between husband and wife. The search for radium and thew success is tempered by the death of Monsieur Curie on the day they are to be honored. It isn't the myhtical story of Edison played by Spencer Tracy but it is a movie that I'd recommend for working couples, and guys who can't build up the courage to ask a woman to marry him."
5,"For Better, for Worse","This book showed me a new perspective on life, at the time I needed it most. The character that inspired me most was Julie, for her bravery and her brains. She took the sour grapes that life gave her, and went on with life holding her head high. Julie is a wonderful example for teens who are crossing over into womenhood. I would suggest this book to all smart young ladies, who are looking for a romance novel that they will never forget."
2,Please read my other review,"This ""Best Of"" recording is the English version of the American version of Cowboy Junkies hits. The only difference between the two is the English version includes ""A Horse In The Country"" from the ""Black Eye Man"" album that was omitted from the American version. This was one of my complaints about that album. Nice to see that song is included here but doesn't make up for the other complaints about the album. Biggest being this is an album that was released without any contribution or approval from Cowboy Junkies. I will state one more time if you are looking for a good ""Greatest Hits"" album by Cowboy Junkies the best and only true greatest hits CD to get is ""Studio: Selected Studio recordings from 1986 to 1995"". All the recordings on that disc are true greatest hits that cover their early years and first six albums."
3,Disappointing,"I was kind of disappointed with ""A Journey to the New World"", the very first Dear America book I've read. I mean, it definitely gave me a good idea of how things were back then, but it was just boring for me most of the time. Nothing really happened except that a lot of the Pilgrims died. It's not deathly boring, though, so I suggest you give the book a try. Everyone else has been saying this is a good book, but I hope my review is helpful to some readers."
3,Okay,"My 8-year-old daughter enjoyed this book and actually learned quite a bit about the pilgrims. However, the antiquated language was a bit difficult for her to get used to."
5,Pleased mother,"My daughter is studying the pilgrims in school and will not put this book down. She is a good reader, but this is the first book that has her engaged. I think she enjoys the fact that the events really could or did happen. I think she is reading it and feels like she is almost the character. She told me to find her more historical fiction."
4,Nostalgic Review,"This soundtrack is a great piece of nostalgia! It features many songs that were originally popular in the '20s and '30s. The cast does a great job capturing the feel of the era. The tempoes are a little slow, but other than that I have no complaints. I highly reccomend this recording to anyone who enjoys music from the golden era."
3,Great for hard-core compiler gurus,"I picked this text up in anticipation for a compiler course at Georgia Tech. I have not read any other compiler books, so I have little to compare it to. However, I can definitely say that this is a book for people who are looking for ""hard-core"" compiler knowledge. It is a very dry and meticulous book. Contrary to the opinions of other reviewers, this is not an ""easy to understand text"". It will take quite a bit of determination to get the most out of it. If you don't love the stuff, you'll stop reading at page 100 or so. As for topics explained in this book, it seems to cover just about everything you will need to understand and write a full-blown compiler."
4,Excellent book for a first course in compiler construction,"If you are getting into compiler construction today, you will see a lot of ""cutting edge"" stuff which discusses minute details of optimization but assumes you are already versed in the art. You may also see a few ""baby books"" that don't require any real background but also don't give you any real depth.This is the Standard reference on compiler construction. It assumes you are familiar with programming, and it gives you enough tools and techniques to write good compilers. More importantly, it is the book that will give you the grounding in terms of art and technique that more recent works require for comprehension.In short, this is the book that can take you from knowing programming to knowing how to build compilers. There are cutting edge things it doesn't cover, but it gives you the knowledge to understand them when you get to them."
2,Dry as Gin,My graduate compiler class used this book. I hated it. The book is dry and seems to be disorganized to the untrained eye. Many of the examples are either incomplete or the bare min.
1,"Trivial, non-constructive, hard-to-follow, terrible",The worst textbook I've ever read.For Many times I've been confused by the author's explanation for some very simple ideas.
4,A Sweet Edge,"Getz' sound has a sweet edge that speaks to me like no other sax voice. If you've never heard much Stan Getz, this will get you a superb sampling. If you're already a fan, these Joe Henderson picked selections will thrill you.The variety of styles on this CD makes listening even more exciting. Dizzy's exhilarating contributions heard here should be mentioned as well.A co-worker lent me this CD at the office today. Tonight, its going on my wish list."
2,Please.....,"No-one has ever contended that Matsuura Aya (aka AYAYA) could sing, but she sells a lot of product in Japan, and, for those who have seen any Hello! Project Sports Festivals, we know she can run but she can't play futsal. Puh-leeeeze...."
2,I received my item from Dynamic Bridge not ibuyherb,"After receiving my item, I've noticed that ibuyherb was not the shipper it was Takeherb (dynamic bridge ).Be advised .Ahmed"
5,Great Product,"Great Product, it has really lasted. Great price. I just wish that I had measured rather than relying on the initals XT because it is actually a bit small for my xl dog house but it still works!"
4,"Okay, it's almost a FIVE","Smooth Jazz is a lot like people deciding to open restaurants, just because a few people say you can cook doesn't mean you'd be a successful restaurant operator. This CD is very melodic and Karukas designs extremely rich textures. My favorite trax are 3, 5 and 8 and these are extraordinary. The rest of the CD however drags my rating to a four. I would say I am very satisfied with my purchase I'm just very critical and me taking the time to critique at all would indicate that this CD is worth adding to your collection."
5,Nearly perfect,"This is a nearly perfect little gem I consider to be the best investment I ever made. I picked this up a couple years ago from a $1 ""cut-out"" bin and it turned out to be one of my survival tools for Houston traffic. This cd has an immediate relaxing effect on me no matter how bad my commute to work is. Even the lone vocal number sung by Jonathan Butler doesn't seem out place in the middle of this otherwise all-instrumental collection. The title track is a staple on the local smooth jazz station 95.7 ""the wave"". I have to wonder why Gregg hasn't released anything since this one. Must be hard to top ""near perfection"". Highly recommended for smooth jazz fans.-mw"
3,Good Quotes,This is a pretty good little book. About the right price. Good to pick up once in a while and just browse the section you want to think about.
2,Nothing very unique.,The quotes were fine but things that are easily found in free quote collection websites. Based on the title I was expecting some additional insights from the author and not just a list of quotes. Also the formatting on the kindle version was not particularly good.
2,A little too advanced for the beginner.,"If you were going to limit a book on language to 1001 words, it seems to me at least that you would address only the words useful to the traveler and group them into usable sections, much like the Rick Steves books do."
4,Mona Lisa,The avery Half-Fold Greeting Cards for Inkjet Printers are great for Greeting Cards and Invitations. I have made Invitatons and Greeting Cards with ease using this kit. You can easly download Avery Templates and Software to help you make beautiful cards everyone will enjoy receiving.
5,Works exactly as advertised,I recommend this purchase for anyone looking for a roof top magnetic mount. There are no negative issues to report
3,A lot of tinkering needed to get SWR down.,"This magnet mount antenna sits on the top of a 2006 Toyota Van. It attaches to a Uniden Pro 538W CB. I found the antenna a little more difficult adjust the SWR than some other antenna brands I have owned. However, once I got it adjusted it really let the radio transmit all it could. I got very good speaking distance out and in during the heat of the day, when the noise level was high. I would recommend this antenna and advise the purchaser to take time to tune it properly. It also seems to stick to the car at very good highway speeds. It doesn't move!"
3,Disappointing,"Ray Brown has been my favorite bassist for years now, and this has got to be one of his biggest disappointments ever. He has recruited some of the best trumpets out there (not mentioning Wynton Marsalis) but the song selection isn't that great. Jon Faddis is amazing and can reach high notes. Terence Blanchard, Roy Hargrove, Clark Terry, and Nicholas Payton do not give it their best on this cd. Great playing, I couldn't play it for sure, but the effort here for the trumpet players was close to none. However, Ray Brown, and the rest of the rhythm section are great. Below are cds I recommend:1. Dizzy's 80th Birthday Party (Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars) Great trumpet playing, and saxophone playing especially by Antonio Hart.P.S Please Check Out My Reviews On The Recommended CDs!"
2,Watch out for paper jams,"I purchased this printer because I have had a great deal of success with HP products in the past. I must say that I have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this printer. It ROUTINELY attempts to take in more than one sheet of paper (e.g., 5 or 6); consequently, I have had a tremendous amount of paper jams. This has become such a problem that I now prefer just to wait and print my documents at work. Beware!"
2,Overpriced for what it offers - jams alot too,I am disapointed with the HP 1100. The main reason is that is constantly takes more than 1 sheet at a time when printing which is a pain in the neck and also a problem b/c it causes paper jams. Go with another printer. My office originally bought about 8 of the 1100's and we will not be buying them in the future.
4,bubbles for baby,"bubbles for babies 1st b-day. he had a blast. thanks. secret to having thicker solution is to keep the top off the bottles over night, then it gives off lots of bubbles."
1,The 7 minute toy,"This toy lasted a total of seven minutes, from opening the package to when it stopped working forever. After happily making bubbles for the first 6.5 minutes, my son picked it up to look inside the bubble reservoir. This caused the bubble soap to slosh back over the (apparently unprotected) fan and motor.... and the toy stopped working. We let it dry out for two days before throwing it away, but it never worked again."
5,"A fine blend of Jazz, Soul, and Pop...with no rap or hip-hop","An extraordinary album that cannot miss in your collection !!! The album starts off with rythm, but it is wisely balanced, and you can also find smooth and sexy tunes. J.K. recently played on the ""Return of the Headhunters"" album and is one of Herbie Hancock's favourite guitarists. Some will inevitably say he sounds like George Benson, but he is young, he sounds great, and this record is not one that will go out of fashion in three months. Highly recommendable."
3,The White City,"Gene Wilder's narration adds an appropriate sense of Willy Wonka-esque wonder to this solid overview of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. At almost two hours, though, the DVD drags a bit - cheesy reenactments, for one thing, might have been happily omitted. While this documentary provides a lot of interesting information about how the Exposition came to be, and what it contained, it falls short in adequately placing the Exposition in a broader context. The most glaring and unfortunate oversight is the failure to include any discussion of the Fair's exclusion of African-Americans, and the resulting controversy."
5,A Trip In Time To A Magic Universe,"If you have ever loved a trip to a theme park, county fair, or world's fair, you should love this trip to the ""grand-daddy"" of 'em all. Though it is only told in still photos, the voyage is remarkably detailed and explores the many facets of this famous exposition that set the pattern for everything that came afterwards. Gene Wilder's narration adds to the drama. This is a magic trip into the past that has relevance today."
4,Deserving of more attention,"An excellent print of a movie that has been obscure for too many years. Newman (not always the brilliant actor many claimed he was) fills the bill superbly. And Blyth, carrying a difficult, cliché-ridden role, does a fine of making Morgan credible and sympathetic.A major pleasure in this film is the soundtrack of Gogi Grant singing for Ann Blythe which I have always considered to be one of the finest ""female vocal"" albums of the 50's."
2,The Old Meets the New,"This is an incredibly dated and white washed portrait of Helen Morgan, interesting for really only one reason, as an old time movie star meets a new breed star of the 50s. Ann Blyth was at the very end of her movie career, even though she probably didnt realise it at the time, she had just been let go from her MGM contract and saw this vehicle as a chance to shine in a dramatic role after being a coquettish heroine in films such as ""Rose Marie"" and ""The Student prince"" (Her musical movies have mostly been ignored by DVD)Unfortunately she did not prove capable of the requirements of the cliched role and never made another movie and Newman who was a star on the rise acts her off the screen in a role that helped launch his burgeoning movie career.As a movie it is slow and pretty inaccurate of the tragic life of Morgan."
2,Sorry I asked...,"Blue Oyster Cult has always been sort of a mystery to me. Since I was a kid, I've only been aware of two of their songs, Don't Fear the Reaper and Godzilla. I never cared at all for the former, I kinda like the latter. Recently I read somewhere that BOC was considered ""America's answer to Black Sabbath"" and the word ""heavy"" was thrown around a few times. I decided to see for myself and I ordered the debut album and T&M. All I can say is ""Huh?! 'America's answer to Black Sabbath'?!?! 'Heavy'?!?!?! What the heck are you talking about???"" I suppose back in the early 70s, this stuff may have been considered heavy. But where the Black Sabbath comparison comes in, I don't know. Black Sabbath's music is the very epitome of HEAVY, and more important, timeless. The music on these albums is as dated as denim bell bottoms and suede vests with fringe. Sounds more like America's answer to early Yes to me."
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!,This albumn is AWESOME; absolutely amazing! T&M has the best guitar playing you will EVER hear on a rock and roll record! INCREDIBLE!
2,Disapointing,"While we have watched both Open Season and Open Season 2 several times, I doubt we will watch Open Season 3 again. While it may work OK for the 12 and under crowd, most others will be disappointed by the voices and animation. The story never got any traction, and had no depth. Could I sum it up by saying we watched it, but we were looking forward to the ending so we could go to bed? There were a few laugh out loud moments, but gags were poorly written or overdone. One of the high points is Roger, the ""dumb"" cat. We would have liked to have seen more of him. This movie was watched by a 9, 11, and a 13 year old, as well as two adults. It may be worth renting, but wait till it is cheap if you are going to buy it. We actually hope for a 4th version, with some more time and effort, and more Roger the cat."
1,Terrible Movie,"This movie is really bad. The story is bad, the jokes were stupid and not funny, and the characters are annoying. Even the kids I watched it with got bored after half an hour of watching this movie! So for a kid's movie this is not a good choice."
2,Why waste your money on a stinker?,"We kept yawning while watching this Sony stinker. It's probably the worst digitally-animated movie we've ever seen, and we've seen all the biggies. BUT, we did give it 2 stars and not one because it does have a few fun scenes. But, those fun scenes are too few. It's really lacking adult humor. Kids MAY enjoy it (we've got none so we can't comment). Please, don't waste your money on this movie unless you're sure your little ones might like it."
4,Great family movie,We have Open Season 1 and then ordered 2 and 3. We figured it would be fun to see how they continued the story-and we were quite entertained. I think the Grandsons liked it too!
3,"Ok Kid Entertainment ONCE, Not a Keeper","My kids, ages 5 and 7, were entertained by this, as with the first two movies, but as with many sequels, the characters are getting old, the gags repetitive, and the storylines uninspired, so it's not one I see us watching over and over. This one mostly centers around Boog the bear, who trades places with a trained grizzly in a circus in order to woo the girl bear working there too. Meanwhile, the bear he trades with tries to turn Boog's friends, including Elliot the mule deer, into servants. Once they figure out he is not the real Boog, they seek to rescue Boog. The wacky RV-driving couple with all the dogs make comic appearances too, as the dogs realize Boog needs help. Lots of silliness, OK voice-talent, and OK animation make this fine for the kids. But as I said, nothing too inspired and certainly nothing very interesting for adults, so this is probably a 1-time film."
3,"Unlike alot of ppl, im not going to act like some ""professional commenter""......amazon dorks......=P","=^^=Ok,Well the storyline of Saiyuki has been, and always will be great! But the anime......blah.....Lets just say, without the amazingly fantastic storyline, this anime would be a total flop;The fighting scenes are seriously corny, alot of the english vocals are corny/non-fitting, and the animation/art in some parts are, well, not as good as i expected.So would i recommend spending $27.00? No way in hell. But i do recommend watching it, if you liked the Manga. Just go to eBay, or rent it from blockbuster or something.......(Much cheaper that way....)You shouldn't pay $27.00 for it,it or any other anime DVD personally.......I beleive Overstock.com has it for cheaper too......(I rented it....)Well i hope that helped.....-Iza-"
2,"Cheap printer, expensive ink","I saved money buying this printer, but it seems to require frequent ink cartridge changes (compared to the Epson inkjet on my Macintosh). I suspect that I may have lost any savings in buying new ink cartridges. However, the printer has so far (4 months of use)only had a few problems."
4,Incredibly good at the price,"I am pleasantly surprised to find that this sub-80 dollar printer is reasonably fast and prints crisp black text that you have to look very closely at to see that it's not from a laser printer ! The colour printing is also very good. It seems a little ink hungry (half of black ink cartridge gone after 35 pages of text and a few pictures). Time will tell whether it's build quality will take any serious use. At the price, though, this is incredibly good value."
1,Not a good Printer,We had lot of problems with this printer. We just printed one color paper and ink cartridge was half empty. It takes lots of ink and quality is not at all good. We did not use it much after that and now we are planning to buy new printer. Not a Xerox one - of course.
1,"So hard to read, it hurts","Don't try using this book as a textbook. Don't try to study Damage Mechanics on your own with this book. Don't try to use it as a reference to learn quickly about some aspect that interests you. I guess is a treatise written for the few that already know this stuff. Written by a knowledgeable researcher, the book is *very* hard to read. Read instead his 1989 paper ""Damage Mechanics"" in Mechanics of Materials, p. 117-197. The subject index is inadequate; you cannot find anything relevant with it. I am hoping Amazon or Google will scan this book and make it searchable. The book emphasizes the micro structural aspects of damage mechanics. At 761 pages typeset in 8 point font (may be less) and containing *very* long passages, it is *very* hard to read."
3,Only so-so,"Some of the Saint-Saens pieces are not recorded well, in the ""Cuckoo"" for example, you can't hear the cuckoo sound unless you have the sound turned WAY up. Also, the Peter and the Wolf should not be an ""extract""--it frustrated both my grand-daughter and myself when the story did not continue."
4,great 'quiet time' music,bought this as a new edition to our 'quiet time' collection of cds and the kids really enjoy this.
5,Great tool.,I bought this tool based on Jason Miller's review. I borrowed a 'genuine' PEX crimper in 2005 when I replaced a water heater. Now in 2007 I'm remodeling two bathrooms & a kitchen. I did not have the option of borrowing the 'genuine' tool this time - did not want to spend $100+ for a genuine crimper and figured if I rented the tool three times as I worked through these projects that would be expensive too. I've used the Yankee crimper to do one bathroom so far. I found the tool to be well designed & rugged. The only major difference I found is the 'genuine' crimper is faster. If I was building a house I'd opt for the 'genuine' crimper. For remodeling projects like mine the Yankee crimper is great. It does everything the more expensive crimper does. I used the tool the way the directions said to & every crimp was a good one. A++
1,Not all its made out to be..,"My hands can barely grip my steering wheel and I have nearly bruised palms from the amount of pressure it takes to make these things crimp. I'm on the stronger side of folks, and this was without a doubt the hardest part of the entire home remodel project I'm doing. These things are nearly impossible to use, and fall apart when you unlock your vice grips, so you have to realign them each time you squeeze. Most crimps require AT LEAST 4 squeezes, so count on doing at least 4 times as much work as with a normal crimping tool. I want a refund. Save yourself the time and buy a tool for twice as much to save yourself the time and painful hands."
5,Excellent Reading on Internet E-Commerce,"This book is well written and presents many industrial success stories on E-Commerce. The graphics in the book are excellent, especially business transformation graphics which show the typical models for many companies converging in the E-Commerce market.I highly suggest to anyone interested in the topic of E-Commerce to purchase this book. Out of all the books on the market today, I find this book to be right at the top with excellent content on the subject. I am a senior business leader in a large global company, and have experienced many situations where the text in this book, maps into the problems which the biggest firms worldwide have experienced during E-Commerce business transformations.These authors have obviously experienced the work challenges associated with Internet Commerce challenges. It is very clear that they not only are seasoned in this field, but also practitioners in the field, as well."
5,E-commerce Book Review,"I found the book to be inciteful and informative. This publication's exploration of e-commerce and its business applications were thorough and indicated great thought, research, and experience. The book also provides extensive direction to any organization who aspires to expand through the use of e-commerce."
5,"Astrological Signatures:The Two Keys, The Zodiac, Mundane Houses, The mission of the Soul, Physiology and Correspondence, ...","Only a beginner on a spiritual path, I am delighted to have found this little ""golden treasure"" of clear and concise wisdom. Highly recommended to anyone who is seeking answers to life's most mysterious questions."
2,Too pricey for 4 eps,No one should go broke to buy an entire series on DVD. Even a $10 drop in the price would make thus a more appealing purchase --especially since the local Blockbusters will almost certainly sell previously viewed copies of this series in about 3 months (as they did with S1)
2,"No, no, no, no...","No, no, no... Don't come to me saying this is a ""great"" Cult album. No way, no way on Earth!! 1974's SECRET TREATIES simply didn't survive the passing of time. I bought it just for the cover art (the fool I am...), because I'm an fighter aviation freak. THe mixing is ridiculous, the songs lack punch (that's the difference for band like KISS, for example, who did silly songs but with aggression and convinction). The vocasl are their worse ever. I would not recommend this album for no one interested in knowing BLUE OYSTER CULT."
2,This Is Before BOC Made It BIG!!!,"I owned Secret Treaties on vinyl when it first came out. Although, my musical tastes have changed over the years, I can appreciate these guys for the hard rock sound that they had. My favorite selections are Dominance and Submission, Flaming Telepaths, and Astronomy. Some of the songs are repetative and annoying at times, but maybe it's just me. This is before BOC made it BIG!!! It was at that time that I stopped listening to them."
4,Impressive Improvement,"Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven was an extreme improvement over its prequils. It's the first Might and Magic game to have an actual 3D world.Some may critisize the use of 2D sprites in the game. The reason for this is to save memory. At some point in the game literally hundreds of enemys could be in the area at a time, and to use 3D objects would take up too much memory.The thing I was dissapointed in was the roster. You can only have human characters, the ninja class no longer exists (I love ninjas), and you can't change your current pary (like in all the previous MM titles). Other than that it's very fun to play for hours."
5,A much needed statistical treaties.,"Drawing on the still small number of admitted sex-addicts with a significant amount of time in recovery, (3-5 years or more), this book looks at the statistical, predictable journey of the recovering sex addict. The book presents a realistic yet hopeful view for all who suffer, and are willing to work at recovery, from this dreadful affliction."
5,"A Wonderful Book on Lucy, Desi, and I Love Lucy","I loved this book almost as much as I loved reading ""Love,Lucy"" (I've reviewed that book as well). Some of the pictures are in color, and a lot of them are ""never-before seen"". This book takes an inside look at the fascinating lives of both Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the complete history of the I Love Lucy show, and how life was for everyone after I Love Lucy ended. It even has sort of a scrapbook chapter in the end with pictures and descriptions of the plots from the 35 ""best"" Lucy shows (I think all of them are the best! ). ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Picture History of The Most Popular TV Show Ever"" was written by Michael McClay, the son of one of Lucy's former publicists, so a great amount of information is accurate. I am a die-hard Lucy fan who has taped every episode of I Love Lucy and owns A LOT of books and videos on the lives of Lucy and Desi, so take my word for it: This is a must have for everyone who loves Lucy."
5,Like Nothing You've Heard Before,"There is just something very DIFFERENT about Bjork that enraptures me. The movie was my first introduction to her music and I was hooked. Her stuff is clearly not something that everyone will love. There are atonal elements that might lead some purists to dismiss it but, at the same time, there is something soaring and innocent and ethereal. And she has such a wierd, strangely alluring accent -- imagine Audrey Hepburn on mood drugs. If you have not seen the movie, be sure to listen to the clips on Amazon.con before buying the soundtrack. Bjork is an acquired taste. Like truffles."
5,Gamera 2 means Two Times the Turtle,"This sequel is quite outstanding to me, and it's AWESOME.The story plot makes senseThe special effects is flawlessGamera looks EPIC when he did that slide landingLegion is a worthy fighter against Gamera.The special features is fun.*The Lake Texarkana Gamera dub is HILARIOUS*"
3,"Been there, done that.","It is amazing how the japanese do not improve the plot, the acting and the overall special effects to make a movie up to standards. Gamera 2 is better (in the FX department) than older versions, but still behind the times. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
4,Good basic book about geography,This book does provide a good basic introduction for kids. Just needs to have some pictures updated in it. My four-year-old twins will enjoy it.
2,The replacement inner blade is not the same!!!!,"Hey,what's going on? I ordered replacement inner blades for my ES8068 and they are not the same. This razor has been there for me through thick and thin. I did not notice till after I opened the pack. I been buying through Amazon for a while now. I buy all my text books here with never a problem. Are the replacement blades cheap knock off's? The originals are like freaken Samurai swords in quality when compared to the ones I bought here. I'm so dissapointed with Amazon. You are the middle man. Fix this!!!!! The info on the link is wrong."
4,a close shave,"It's made for the shaver and it does the job, not much more to be said really. Not as close as a plain old manual razor like a Gillette but you don't have to get wet to use it!"
5,good renewal to the razor,The replacement blades really brought the razor back to life. I'll buy these again!
3,ALPHA DVD VERSION,"NOT BAD 1960 ITALIAN SPACE OPUS ABOUT ANNOYING REPORTER WHO SAVES THE EARTH. GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS (FOR THE TIME) & AN INTERESTING CAST, ESPECIALLY ARCHIE SAVAGE AS AL WHO SACRIFICES HIS LIFE SO STAR RIK VON NUTTER (THE FIRST ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER) CAN BECOME THE HERO AND GET THE GIRL!!! THIS IS THE SPACE FILM WHERE EVERYONE WEARS THE STEVE CANYON FLIGHT HELMETS!!!THE ALPHA DVD IS CLEAR & WATCHABLE, NOT HAMPERED WITH ANNOYING CUTS/SPLICES/JUMPS...HOWEVER, THE COLOR IS SO FADED THE FILM APPEARS TO BE SHOT IN SEPIA-TONE. THIS IS ONE FILM A COMPANY LIKE IMAGE NEEDS TO RELEASE IN WIDESCREEN...PLEASE!!!"
2,A Little Book That Tries Too Hard,"Fun vintage photos with some true-isms, but Pat Ross tries too hard to be funny...."
2,Typical,"Pop garbage has never been defined so clearly as its being done by the current crop of boy-bands. But 98 Degrees, one of the few boy bands who look like they've spent time in the gym, return with a horrendous new pop-dance-ballad called 'Una Noche'. As is the fashion these days, the boys rope in an unknown Latin star to moan a few Spanish words with hopes that the single would thus cross over onto the Spanish charts as well (and it did).Musically, however, the single is catchy and hummable and worth three listens on the radio, but to actually go out and buy it (and worse, buy the album) is a sin. While there are few things on heaven and Earth that can be classified as sins anymore, this would certainly rank right up there. Disgusting pop drivel."
2,Not as Helpful,"I thought this would be a good resource. I hold ""Love & Logic"" in high regaurd it is fantastic in the classroom and at home. This is a workbook mainly for teachers, those attending seminars, or those who are presently watching the videos. As a quick & easy referance guide to give help in a timely manner for a current issue it isn't worth it."
4,Getting Better,"The last two have shown disapointment in my opinion, the 2nd one was better then the first in my opinion but not by much, now the 3rd Vol I can only say NOW it's getting good.and i'm starting to like the characters more.Also hahaha I'd say this dvd should get a 5 because of showing the Wild Arms 1 and 2 playstation game intro's I mean That's cool!But I'll grade it as the show is, it is getting alot better."
3,A good selection,"This CD has a good selection of songs on it.We will use one of the songs for the ceremony.We found a couple of other wedding CDs on amazon.com tooOne of them is ""Classical Wedding Traditions""The sound on this CD is simply amazing.I will enjoy this one long after the wedding.Amazon.com has helped us a lot in planning our wedding music."
4,Preview your wedding day,"This CD was inexpensive, and provided a great way to preview songs for my wedding. The CD had a good song selection. My fiance and I were able to get a better idea of how the songs would be at our wedding. Definitely an inexpensive tool that is worthwhile."
3,Good selection at affordable price,"It's a beatiful opportunity for selecting (or remembering) the soundtrack at your wedding ceremony. Some of the recordings are a bit pretentious and may somehow override the original score, but most are definitely appreciable. The anthology covers a broad variety of periods and genders: connoisseurs might want to be more selective."
4,leannes review,"cd case is very broke, but it was noted before i bought it. cd works good. very happy."
2,It's good... if all you wanna learn in 3 steps!,"They teach you the basic triple step, followed by the Open loop, and one underarm turn... THAT IS IT! Definitely beginner's stuff... definitely something I dont wanna buy (I rented it from the public library) I've ordered the Chris Reilly and Ginger Swing Video. Hopefully that will show me a lot more steps at an intermediate level!"
4,A great read!,"This is a fast-paced, fact-based book about the Civil War. If you are looking for a great war drama, this is it. The detail is amazing. It is almost as if the author lived during this war. The main characters are Southeners and I began to root for the Rebels, hoping that there was some way they might actually win this war. It is just that good. The ending feels very abrupt, as if the author wanted to tell more but ran out of space. I definitely recommend reading the next book of the trilogy right after the first. It helps finish the story. Some questions you have at the end of this book are answered in the next book. Overall, a great book!"
3,It leaves the reader wondering about Fergie's character,If all said is true I'll never know but I do wonder about Fergie's conduct toward other human beings and why some of those often mistreated by her -the author in particular- kept returning for more and larger dosis of tantrums. Perhaps they were seeking recognition by everyone as friends of Fergie.
3,Not the original TV-Theme,"If you are looking for the original TV-Theme buy this one:Television's Greatest Hits, Vol.3: From the 70's and 80's"
3,"'the feeble, nervous and incompetent Louis X'","The third in Druon's 'Accursed Kings' series continues the life of Louis X. With his first, faithless wife assassinated, Louis now awaits the arrival of his new bride, the lovely and pious Clemence of Hungary. But Louis is facing problems within his realm: war with the Flemings, famine and the uprising of the barons.Alongside the story of the royals, Druon continues the tale of young Lombard banker, Guccio Baglioni, who appeared in the first two books. Will he manage to marry the French noblewoman he loves?Brilliantly researched as ever"
5,Andy Williams Christmas Present album,excellent album--every cut is good. Wonderful to listen to. His best holiday album.
1,Out of Date,"This is the solution manual for the second edition textbook which is no longer used.It is suggested by amazon as ""frequently bought together"" which I'm sure is true, but this is misleading and causes people to spend $70 on a book that they can not use.The second and third edition texts have different problems so this book is completely useless.I plan to return it."
5,Easton XX75,"Best arrows I've ever shot! I used to buy the cheap arrows at dicks spoting goods for about $4.50 a peice and the feathers were all one peice of rubber and wold tear easily, and the heads were so weak that my styraphome target could dent them, but these come ot to be only like $2 more (per arrow)and the feathers are actally like feathers (not all one peice) and not rubber. The arrow heads are much harder and sharper and connect seamlesly to the shaft. Great buy!"
4,Colonial Economics,This is an excellent study of life among the upper classes in Virgina and North Carolinia. This is the first book I have read that provides details on how many of the planter class struggled to keep their heads above water while trying to appear rich.I have often wondered what motives some of the elites had in joiing the American Revolution. Royster points out that more than a few of the planter class had strong economic reasons to sever ties with Britian in the hopes of freeing themselves from a mountain of debt.
5,An excellent compilation,"I've never seen the movie, so I don't know how well the music is integrated in the film, but the music itself is quite superb. It presents a pretty even mixture of new and old Brazillian music. The best song, in my opinion, is ""Batucada"" sung by Babel Gilberto and Vinicius Cantuaria - his voice is like silk. This song is worth the CD alone. The percussion is excellent. You also get a lot of music on this CD. If you're looking for a primer on Bossa Nova this is a good selection."
4,Weber Genesis Silver B Gas Grill,"Good product. Reduced price due to end of model year, newer model has enclosed stainless steel lower cabinet. Sent by amazon in one day, two weeks to arrive at my house."
2,"Nice pictures, but no techniques or recommendations","This book is more like photo album, not an educational material for a photographer. No techniqie description, no explanation how to get to those towns, what is the best season, which equipment was used. A coffee table book."
1,Bad clasp- don't buy,The clasp is defective. It falls off everyday several times. Now I have to buy a new band for 300.00. Seller won't do anything and Michelle does not cover bands. Don't buy it!!!
2,Good concept but not enough pieces,"This kit contains four long flexors (which can be curved all the way back to attach both ends to the same ball), six short flexors (made of the same material, but too short to curve), and 15 balls.The concept is a good one. The ability to curve the pieces to join them makes the toy more interesting to play with. However, we haven't been able to figure out how to use more than 8 balls at once, and there are only enough long pieces to make ONE of the many shapes shown on the outside of the box. A better 25-piece mix would have been 10 long pieces, 5 short ones, and 10 balls. The kit as sold has the same number of pieces but is only half as useful.Don't buy this product alone. I wouldn't get less than two boxes, preferably three. This makes it much more expensive than it looks."
2,Skip it and read Minotaur,"You'd be crazy not to fall in love with Sherrill's first book, The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break. In his sophomore novel-writing effort, however, Sherrill falls short. The writing style hasn't changed much (thankfully), but the characters' interaction/dialogue always seems to teeter between believability and forced plot.The characters are never fully developed with exception to the main character, Benny, who is developed perhaps too much in ways not relevant to the story, such as his masturbatory patterns and having a keen eye for witnessing lewd acts.One strange chapter I'm still trying to figure out why Sherrill's editor left in: Benny reminisces about bluegrass music for 4 pages, a complete non sequitur in the story. I skipped right over most of that...and I really should have done so with the rest of the book."
1,So disappointed,"I can't tell you how excited I was to read this as Sherrill's first book, The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break, is one of my all time favorites. Too bad! The writing is fantastic, but I just couldn't get past the heartless, depressing characters. So negative. So low. Ah well, I'll still look forward to Sherrill's next effort as I think he is incredibly talented--he just doesn't put it to use here."
1,Ditto...Sad Waste,"Ditto to the reviewers who panned this book. I find it annoying when a writer of such obvious ability wastes everyone's time condescending to cartoon characters, faux crackers with names like Jeeter, Dink and Doodle, whose incomes are derived from tropical fish maintenance, hash-slinging, and off-hours fellatio. A mash-up of motiveless incidents, gratuitous, distasteful, unkind and grotesque, weakly strung together by the theme of sequential viewing of videotapes left by a young woman whose drowning suicide the hero, Benny Poteat, witnesses. Little information is gleaned in sum and none illuminating. The author could not pay me to raise the least interest in these characters or the story -- he shows equal weary indifference for these former and his audience. Please."
1,Stains white Macbook,"While this product provides great protection, it has left black stains on my white MacBook, which I am not impressed with. I noticed it appearing on the one corner, and now it's on all the edges. Apparently you can remove it with an eraser, which I have not yet tried. This is still not acceptable though and I'll be looking for a refund."
5,"Good for some, not for all","I purchased these finger cots based on negative feedback from a user review, odd how that works. The user claimed these were cheap, thin, and broke easily, and honestly, that's what I wanted. I use these to apply cream in an intimate location. Another brand of finger cots I used, from CVS, was very thick and I could not tell how much pressure I was applying to the area. These finger cots are very thin and allow me to feel what I am doing. They have yet to break on me, and while that's not the most desirable thing, I can see that being a problem for some other uses. The real problem with these, and other finger cots, is that not enough information is supplied. If we knew the thickness ahead of time, no one would be disappointed. Regardless, hopefully this review will help you decide whether these finger cots meet your needs."
4,Very affordable and great for applying transdermal medication,I use these to give my cat transdermal medication (through the skin). They work great and are much cheaper than getting them at my local pharmacy which doesn't always have them.
4,Great product,"These finger cots work as advertised! Althought the latex used is not as soft as Flints, you can't really beat the price.Oh yeah, and shipping was super fast. I was amazed at how quick it got to me."
4,They are finger cots...,"As in other reviews, the sizes do run a little small. They were fine for me depending upon what finger I wear them on.I use them when I don't need to waste a full glove, such as applying putty or caulk. I also use them while playing slots at the casino.The best price I could find for the quantity and shipping."
1,High Price - Low Playability,"While the book has tons of background info and storyline material, it lacks much in the applicability department. There is little here to interest the average player, the new races and prestige classes are rehashes of older material, or are so specific, it is unlikely anyone would get much use from them. I expected new subraces, prestige classes and feats - and got a few hundred pages of story. For the price, it's just not worth what you get."
1,A dire album from a cookin band,"Believe Mr McNiel - don't buy this unless you are already a fan and have heard the crackin' stuff Mountain recorded elsewhere on albums like Flowers of Evil and Twin Peaks. This was a band which - a bit like Humble Pie - had a handful of great songs, and a few darn good ones. None of them are on this disc."
5,Hella Good,I loved House of Pain but Everlast has definitely defied the odds on his own. All of the albums including this one just put you into this world of music and I don't want to leave. It is HELLLLLAAAAA GOOOOOODD.
3,The HOP days are over Everlast,"I admit, I ahven't heard this whole album, therefore I am not going to judge it as a whole. What's up with the Children's Story cover? Ever can't rap anymore, I don't know why he tries. Anyway, highlights include 'one two' and 'deadly assassins.' I'm givin this 3 stars anyway cuz I know what ZLast is capable of. This si probably better than I presume, but Ev should've promoted 'deadly assassins' instead of 'black jesus.' The song is tight, but it wouldve been better if done by a better vocalist."
3,I'll have seconds.,"I just recently got ""Eat At Whitey's"", and am glad I did. It's actually the third solo disc of his, and second since House Of Pain. Fans of his ""Whitey Ford Sings The Blues"" album should like this as well, as it's another good mix of guitars and rhymes. I really like the opener alot, and ""Black Jesus"" was the hit from this, though not what I would call the best song. ""I Can't Move"" is a nice mid-paced track, and you gotta love ""Deadly Assassins"" with B-Real from Cypress Hill. The ""Dinner"" side of this album is equally good, my favorite songs being ""One And The Same"", ""One Two"", and ""Graves To Dig"". Overall I hesitate to say this is as good as ""Whitey Ford"", but I will definitely be eating at Whitey's again."
4,Cross over my brother.,"Everlast clearly tries to stradle the worlds of hip hop, folk, blues, even and little scat (Children's story). The problem is, RAP music has been so over done that it's hard to distiguish his style from many of his contemporaries. Whether he want's to admit it or not, he has clearly found his calling as a modern day bluesman. Some of the songs meander a bit and nothing's worse than an song whose lyrics dont live up to the orchestration(Love For Real, Babylon Feeling) but when this guy makes solid contact it's exilirating. I also love the branch he holds out for those who may not have taken advantage of the investment opportunties of the 90's(who's laughing now you greedy bastards). I'm looking forward to hearing what this young man has to say in the future."
5,Mmmm...mmmm,"Whitey can make me have goosebumps--the things he says. If you listen to what he is really saying, it is pretty deep. I love this album. I have had this album for years and the CD has just recently worn out and now I'm buying a new one. This is one CD I can't live without. As a woman especially, I feel he can be sensitive and raw, and tells how men can really feel about women, life, and the world in general. He is so diverse and unique. Two thumbs way up."
5,Not too salty,"These taste really great, although they tend to be dry because they have no salt added. They are very fresh tasting and keep for a long time."
3,That's Carbondale...not Carbindale.,"As a Carbondale area resident (40 miles to the east), this misspelling needs to be corrected.In any case, as a college student at SIU-Carbondale from '93-'96, I can only assume that this album probably contains the local hit of ""Cold Beer"", with the ingenius lyrics of ""Jump up if you like cold beer!"" Obviously a party favorite that could also be envisioned as a sports stadium loudspeaker favorite."
1,O.K.,"This was great fun until it stopped working maybe about 6 months. You're better off with the wooden version of this toy. The wooden coffee maker is worth the money. Yes, the plastic elecronic makes cool sounds & lights, but kids can use their imagination. Now that it's broken, it's no longer played with."
1,Don't buy leaks battery acid,"This toy is overpriced garbage. It is meant to hold some water then ""makes"" coffee with it. Great. Problem is the Manufacturer failed to put a rubber gasket around the battery compartment on the bottom, so as soon as the child pours water it seeps into the battery compartment and I found battery acid oozing out the bottom. Great job with the $25 play coffeemaker for kids folks. To add insult to injury when I called the company ""educational insights"" they were non-responsive, didn't care, and advised me to 'take it back to where I bought it'. Forget this brand, dangerous toys."
3,What is the name of this band?,"I didn't expect to be hearing Steely Dan here, but it sounds EXACTLY like a harder rocking Steely Dan. I do not want to listen to Steely Dan when I am trying to listen to REO Speedwagon. I want to hear REO with Kevin Cronin on lead vocals. This is not REO's finest cd, but it isn't horrible. If you want a GREAT REO album, get R.E.O. T.W.O., I cannot emphasize enough how great a cd it is. Buy this one for an alternative to Kevin's version of REO... Still the great piano playing and guitar work, without Kevin Cronin. Good job though for Mike Murphy to step in and rock out."
3,Overshadowed by its predecessor...,"This album is overshadowed by the previous REO album, the much more powerful ""Ridin the Storm Out."" It is the second of three CD's with lead singer Mike Murphy (the third album, ""This Time We Mean It"" was never released on CD and is no longer available on vinyl or cassette). Murphy is a strong lead singer, but if you didn't like ""Ridin'..."" you won't like this either.The tracks are not particularly memorable, except for the title track (also available on ""Decade of Rock and Roll"") and perhaps one or two others. I find when I listen to this CD that I gravitate toward track 2 ""Throw the Chains Away"", track 5 the title track, and track 10 ""I'm feeling good.""The bottom line is this: of the 20 or so REO discs I own, this is the one that gets the least playing time. If you're an REO collector like me, you'd better get this one before it's completely out of print. If not, this is probably the last REO disc you'd want to buy."
3,Magdalena's Long Walk,"After it was over the three of us looked at each other with quizzical looks... (NOTE: We did not watch any out-takes etc on the DVD, just the movie). Regardless of what the plot-line actually called for, we ended up deciding that the last scene--of Magdalena utterly lost in her own reality--was where she had been all along and that the entire movie was a journey through her fantasy-world. Too, the movie was really slow--long scenes of people walking through the factory for instance. The operation scene was laughable but fun. That aside, we enjoyed Amy Shelton-White's (Magdalena) command of her character throughout the movie. She was convincing, engaging, worth watching. We'll watch for her in future films--she's got talent."
4,one of the best,"it's really one of the best rock picks out there.good weight.special for hard rocks.cons:mine came whit the bottom of the grip part a little decayed, but it does not affect the performance of the pick."
1,WARNING: Here there be Christianity.,"This is the worst book in the flawed Lawhead trilogy. Like the other two, it has redeeming moments. Also like the other two, it is not worth reading through to find them among the tripe. The entire book is terribly anticlimactic. More importantly, it really destroys any suspension of disbelief the reader has managed to work up. Lifelong Pagans suddenly accept modern Christian ideas and doctrine without blinking. All the happenings in the Otherworld end up having had the purpose of making things ""better"" in the modern world (more people are fired up about Christianity).Avoid this title."
2,Like a bad sequel,"I felt at the end of this book like I felt after seeing Indiana Jones and Crystal Skull. Bad idea, never should have done it! To say that this is book is as bad as Indiana Jones 4 is a little too harsh, but there are many similarities. The plot of this book is not nearly as innovative as the first two and the characters become much less vibrant than the first two. The ending is just awful, unsatisfying, and self indulgent for the author. Its like he's trying to say something significant, but its totally a lost cause. The ""full cycle"" part of the book is also trite and mechanical.All in all, I recommend stopping with the Silver Hand."
3,brutal,"In an unnamed Spanish-speaking country possibly somewhere in South America, the government tortures, assaults, mutilates, murders men, and rapes women before killing them. Soldiers descend on towns, cutting off the rebels from their ammunition. A grandfather Don Plutarco, with his son, and grandson are among the rebels. The son tries to smuggle something that the grandfather doesn't dare mention, but will he succeed? His violin over his shoulder, Plutarco gets a mule, then tries to pass the checkpoint, ostensibly to tend his crop. The commanding officer lets him pass but insists on a daily music lesson. The old man tries to pass the ammunition in his violin case under the soldiers' nose, but will he succeed?A movie in black and white, it unfortunately ends without a good explanation as to why the old man was given *something* (wouldn't want to spoil the movie for others) and then not use it. Thus leaving an unfinished ending in my eyes.A good cast.Not a bad movie at all."
3,Glamorous Movie Stars of the Nineties,"This book is an improvement on the previous one in the series (Glamorous Movie Stars of the Eighties). The stars featured actually wear glamorous costumes. All of the actresses are faithfully portrayed by the artist.Unfortunately, as with the previous book in the series, Mr Tierney seems to have drawn the costumes from memory. The colors and details are wrong in several costumes, most notably the historical ones (""Emma"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Portrait of a Lady"", etc).Paper doll enthusiasts and people expecting an accurate record of film costumes of the eighties will be disappointed, but children who want a paper doll of their favorite star to play with, might find this book worthwhile."
3,Very little-kiddish tales,"I liked these books but they seemed little -kiddish. When I read these I was about 8. Thats why I thought they seemed sort of weird. When I was reading Karen's Witch and Karan and Hannie were going to catch the witches I realy thought thet was little-kiddish. I guess my favorite 1 of these books was Karen's Worst Day because all these bad things were happening to her. Here's a list of bad things that happened to her 1 of her brothers got the cereal toy, she fell out of bed, she forgot her favorite pair of jeans at her moms, her favorite show didn't come on, Andrew got to watch T.V., Karen got in trouble for hitting Andrew and those are just a few."
1,This book is horrible,"For anyone looking for something to help them with this topic, this book is confusing and very uninformative."
2,Not that great of a book,"I had to read this book for one of my M.A. classes and I must say, I didn't really enjoy it. It focused on the rodeo and how the Indians used and evolved the rodeo. Indian agents used it, according to this author, to assimilate Indians into white culture but instead it helped reinforce Indian tradition. To me, this book was dull and slow but if you are interested in the topic, then you would probably enjoy it"
4,A great Hop Up history,"Though published in 195i by Floyd Clymer, there's a lot of interesting material here. For a 50 year old tome, much of the coverage is still applicable today, and the mentioned prices you're going to pay for your ""hot road job"" make you wonder what happened to the value of the greenback. Chapter 10, ""What'll She Do"", gives a suprisingly accurate means of back of the envelope estimating what you can expect from your flatmotor as far as horsepower and torque, long before the availabity of a flowbench. The igniton and supercharging sections make you appreciate our present day technology that much more. Keep looking, some copies seem to be coming available!"
3,How to Use Someone's Engine,"Its not that great of a read. There are some interesting modeling chapters if you know little of the subject. However, the modeling chapters use 3dMax and 3dMax is very pricey. The programming sections are on how to use the author's 3d engine."
3,Beware of Packaging is an understatement,"I certainly agree with Elk Grove Village. I'm still trying to figure out what to order. As a fan, couldn't they just sell the entire season like they do with the Star Trek series? I got a whole season of Star Trek (26 episodes) for $100 and only 22 episodes of Andromeda for about $180 and I didn't buy any duplicates. Let's just make it simple, Okay? And maybe drop the price some, Huh?"
5,Eraserhead in Color!!!!,"Anyone who is anyone knows and understands that anything Lynch touches will have a dark yet soothing feel to it. The first impression I got was a vision of a woman breast feeding her new born babe, with only one breast! It is an amazing achievement for David Lynch, it got me through the hours and hours of driving back and forth to my girlfriends house and I cannot wait to hear mor from both Lynch and Miss Montgomery."
2,More sound effects than song,It is hard to imagine how one would use this CD. It is too intrusive for background music and too clipped up for sustained appreciation.Let's face it the music was written for a 12th century audience with 12th century tastes; salting it with all sorts of sound-effects and contemporary theatricality leaves us very little of the abbess and what she wanted to say spiritually and musically.
4,Return to form,"I'm not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about. There's not a song on this album that sounds like anything on CMT or any output of Hank Williams Jr. In fact, I find this album to be his most satisfying in years. Definitely top-tier material, ranking with ""12 Shades of Brown"" and ""Semi Crazy"" as his best work.Frankly, I found ""Long Walk Back"" to be a serious dissappointment...this album relieved my fears. Junior's back and focused! Any fan of ""12"" or ""Semi"" won't be upset with this purchase."
5,Near Pro Quality,"I retired from photography in 1988 and it took the Oly2000 to bring me back to photography! I've tinkered with Mavicas, Kodaks and Nikons, but this little camera is good. Offers the power to be creative with all its optional settings, or the ease of point and shoot. Image quality on 8x10 (on HP glossy paper) is amazing. High res images rival my old Rollei or RB."
4,C-2020 has all the fixes,The newer model c-2020 has all the fixes except the lens cap tether. It comes with charger and NiMH batteries. They even moved the power on switch and changed the menu controls. I thought the software to be very good for most peoples use. A USB memory card reader is still a must have.
2,"Great photos, Batteries are MAJOR issue","This camera takes great pictures and is easy to understand and use. It has a MAJOR drawback though, and I may be returning this camera and buying a different one. The drawback.... It EATS batteries ! A set of Heavy Duty Alkalines will barely last 20 minutes (even with the LCD display turned off.)! I bought two sets of 1200 MA rechargeable batteries from Radio Shack plus a quick charger ($60 worth), and can barely get one set recharged before the other runs down. Don't count on being able to fill up your 8Meg flashcard AND download pictures on the same set of batteries!A second NECESSITY is the AC Adapter. Without this accessory, battery life becomes even more of a problem. This should be a standard feature with this camera.We own a Toshiba and a Sony, and neither one of them consumes power like the Olympus."
4,Truly Something!,"I've had this camera for about 1 month and I must say it's a great purchase! I've had 2 other digital cameras prior to this one (SONY and KODAK) and they were fine cameras as well, but no comparison to this camera if what you want is quality pictures and, if you desire, a challenge if you use the manual mode. The optional floppy disk reader makes it a snap to download the pictures to a computer. I've actually taken pictures that look better than my other regular 35 mm camera, after printing them in photo glossy paper. Excellent buy!"
5,Excellent Book on Jewish Weddings,"This book is an awesome guide to a Jewish wedding and explains the Scriptural & traditional references behind it. It requires only a basic level of Judaica terminology (most of the phrases & words are explained as you go along). It is a must read for all Jews, Messianic Jews, & Christians."
5,H.A. Ironside is one of the greatest christian writers,"I also have read "" Except ye Repent "" by Ironside. He is easy to read and shows God's Word in it's true meaning."
4,Good but there is better,"Ironside's Revelation is good but there is much better. Clarence Larkin's commentary is number 1 with Dr. Peter Ruckman's a close second. If you are serious on Revelation, get all 3 as well as Dr Chuck Missler's Revelation DVD commentary. Stay away from any ""Reformed""(Jesus rules in our heart"" yeah right!!) attempt on this vital book."
1,Snake Oil,Listen to everyone else. This stuff is garbage. Purchased this at a local retail store because my windows were getting fogged up and my defogger wasn't working right.Doesn't work at all. It just a wet wipe. Worthless. Used it twice and nothing happened. Stuff is now in the trash.
5,"Billy Jack - A Good Movie, and that's a fact!!","Billy Jack is an excellent blend of martial arts action, racial intolerance, and the counterculture movement of the late sixties."
1,Awful Boring Movie,"Very old, poorly written, terribly acted boring movie about a bunch of teen hippies on an indian reservation, a bunch of old fart local town republicans and one intermediary (Billy Jack).This movie is incredibly dull, don't bother."
3,PLEASE!!! read my simple review!!!,"Good:* COOL concept: A pacifist lone cowboy that protect the innocents with his rifle, karate and his words.* Good song at the begining of the movie.* Good cinematoghraphy.* Great fight choreoghraphy.* COOL dress for Billy Jack and also his COOL name (Billy Jack).Bad:* No widescreen!! Only standar version.* The sound was VERY inaudible!! You have to turn up the volume.* NO ACTION-PACKED!!! There were only 4 action scenes and two of them were VERY short!!.* Must of the movie is blah,blah,blah!!!* The acting was not so good.ADIOS!"
2,Not a good Babylon book!!!,"This book is a waste of time to read. I did not like it, personally it concentrated to much on LAW!!!It did not have a drama-like touch to it. It is defenitly a horrid book. Babylon 5 fans, don't be up in good hopes when you read it.It will spoil you day. Well, first of all they displayed the Tuchanq very vividly. They went into not-needed detail. The alien ways were described in a gory fashion.Yuck!!!!"
2,Bleh!!!!!!!,"I wanted to like this book. Maybe one day when I want to be bored silly I will try and finish it. I am like a previous reviewer, I had to read a sentence over and over and try to get some meaning out it. Really boring and depressing."
3,Middle of the road 3 stars,"I found this book interesting for the historical setting as well as the basic premise of the story-young dress lodger helps doctor procure bodies for anatomical study. Although the setting and storyline are mostly dark and dreary I did not find it to be an outright depressing book to read. I was disappointed in the story by the lack of character development; I never got a feel for who these characters really were, where they came from and what motivated them. I enjoyed the writing but the narrative bogged down in a few places. The narrator ""themselves""-the dececrated dead- were an interesting avenue for the telling of the story but it would have been better if the reader could have completely understood at the beginning of the story who the narator was rather than having to wait until the end."
3,A Fascinating But Confusing Story.,"This book has a great premise and interesting,well-drawn main charactors although the secondary ones were a bit too sketchy. Also is the so-called ""Student Of Life"" charactor supposed to be Charles Dickens? (Since the author is so obviously influenced by the author,just wondering..) The main problem with this book is that it's over-written. This is an extremely interesting plot to begin with,but the author is obviously so in love with the English language that it bogs the story down. Also the spotty British spellings were distracting,but that could be the fault of the editor. It is very different,and a good historical account of 19th century industrial England.So if you are'nt too squeamish I do recommmend it. P.S. I have no critcism of the book's cover art,it's great and perfectly captures the mood of the story."
2,I wanted to like it,"The cover of this book is beautiful and compelling. That is where the romance ends. In all fairness, the book is very well written and the narrative and who that turns out to be is interesting. But the whole book is so full of drudgery and illness and horrible deaths and corpses. It leaves you feeling dirty like you experienced something darkly twisted and sinister. Recommended only for those who enjoy wallowing in gloom and doom."
1,What's the Point?,The Dress Lodger was a pathetic try at a book meant to make all of mankind question themselves. Instead of doing this; asking what we would have done without the stolen bodies and mistreated poor; the author digresses into frogs and evil secretaries and handsome prince charmings. This could have been the historical novel destined to rock the world of medical science. But it simply becomes a grocery store paperback with research to back it up.
4,Finely Written,and difficult to put down. Ms. Holman has done her homework and unleashed her considerable talent to open a window upon the bleak lives of the lower classes in England's early Industrial Age. She's an excellent wordsmith.
2,Couldn't make it past page 120,"When I read the other reviews posted, I thought we must have been reading different books. While I ordinarily love works of historical fiction, I found The Dress Lodger to be, in a word, irritating. The author is the literary equivalent of someone who talks too much simply because they like the sound of their own voice. When I finally gave up at page 120, virtually nothing had developed in terms of plot. Lastly, I thought if the author referred to me as ""dear reader"" one more time, I would vomit."
5,Barbie e-secret,This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.She has sleep-overs and her friends/cousins love it as well.
4,Scaling the Inner Peaks,"As a non-climbing fan of mountaineering stories who has read quite a few in the genre, I found Breashears story particularly compelling as much a true expression of his life as his vocation. The tale of a young man, overcoming personal adversity without the bitterness we, in the latter part of the last millennium, have come to associate with such stories, pitting body and soul against rock and sky is an inspiration and a great read."
5,Love it!,"This trivia game exceeded my expectations! It's very educational, fun, & challenging. Great for the family or small groups! The graphics on some trivia games are cheesy; this one is definitely not. Love it & would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a good Bible trivia game!"
5,Best Book Ever,I am soo amazed by this book its crazy its so good i dont think i have read a better book he put soo much detail in it THANK YOU CHANDLER YOU REALLY ARE AN INSPERATION
4,Their Most Underated Work,"It's hard to add to what those who have reviewed this CD before me have said. So, I'll keep it short...I bought this on vinyl when it first came out. This was before Kansas began to really make it big. Song For America has always been one of my favorite songs from them and really shows off how great these guys were together as musicians. The rest of the CD is good, but the title cut makes it worth buying. This is probably their most underated work."
4,L A M P L I G H T S Y M P H O N Y ! !,"It is worth your hard earned bucks to buy the Kansas CD, SONG FOR AMERICA just for the track, LAMPLIGHT SYMPHONY. While other reviewers say that it is a ghostly love story. I found this track to be mesmerizing and full of emotion. So full of imagery. It's a masterpiece!!"
3,new eyecup for my E-500,"I've lost old eyecup that came with E-500. I found AS-ME-1 Eyecup information from internet and purchased it.After I've recieved it and use it, I've found that its performance better than the old one a little."
2,Not for E-3 or E-5,"Bought this for improving the viewfinder experience on my E-5. The eyecup installs painlessly (although with a lot of friction). However, if you pay attention, the exit pupil of the magnifier is much smaller compared to that of the camera's eyepice, and so your field of view through the SLR system will be limited. With glasses, it's just borderline unusable. Without glasses, you have to press your eye very close to get the benefit (and it's a nice benefit). However, the materials this product is made out of tend to reflect and flare, putting glare into your eyes. Not cool. Needs protection against stray light."
4,Olympus eyecup magnifier,I like this product and it serves its purpose but could I have lived with out it? Yes. I don't notice a huge change in the view.
2,Almost Useless,Almost useless! Tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration. Went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier.Professional medical photographer.
5,Guitar Legend,"If you ever wanted to feel as though you could have the amazing guitarist Alvin Lee in your home talking directly to you, this is the video to buy.He shares some very personal things about his life and career and makes it feel as though he is a close friend.The video songs are awesome with Alvin's special brand of playing that no one else has ever been able to master as he does.He takes you on his musical journey and what a ride it is!He truly is a ""Guitar Legend"" unequalled!"
5,great read'n for a drug store cowboy,"i have seven full volumes of ""louie"" and found a list of his bantam books. all of them are worth the time and price."
4,relaxation,"a good quick reading book on how to stay in the moment, rehash of what we know but still a good reminder"
5,"Helped me to find a path to mindfulness, amazing!","I am a UCLA student, major in International politics, minor in latin American Studies. I was sent this book after dealing with stress related ailments. I was very unhappy for a long time. This book explains the ideas behind meditation, and everday ways to apply it to ones life. This book really helped me out. I can concentrate better and everything has become easier for me to deal with. I feel great. Plus this book was well written and a lot of fun to read. I suggest other books by the same Hanh as well. They are all wonderful."
5,I do not remember life before this book,"This wonderfully simple and straightforward book has gotten me through the last four years in an almost constant state of joy. Reading it changed my life, how I see the world. A must read for anyone desiring inner peace and incessant happiness"
5,Loved this!,This is probably one of my favorite books by Thich Nhat Hanh that I have read so far. Wonderful words of wisdom to live a mindful life in today's busy society. A true keeper in my practice.
3,Not bad,This book was okay but not is best. Read Live Girls or Night Life for his better stuff. The new neighbor was pretty predictable. It reads quickly and there is plenty of action but the story gets a bit tired.
5,A Simple and Informative Read,"This book is a wonderful, simple, and quick read. Of course the subject matter does get unpleasant, but it's good to know the facts from the perspective of His Holiness at the time that he wrote it in 1962.The book tells the story which everyone knows: how the Chinese invaded Tibet and the Dalai Lama was forced to feel to India. But this book goes in to detail and as a reader, it was great to finally get the ""real"" details of that story, again from his perspective. Prior to reading this, I only knew the story based on films and summaries in guide books, etc.I highly recommend this book, and I would suggest reading this one prior to reading his second autobiography, ""Freedom in Exile"" from the early 1990's."
5,it works,we use it to get a nice 45 on cabinet panels. it works nuch beter than any of the saws we have used. the corners are perfect.
1,"The product never arrived. The seller never responded to my questions of where is the merchandise. Over all, this was terrible.","I have no idea how it is. I never got the book, but they did get my money. I do not believe this is a trustwworthy site to do business with."
2,COULD HAVE SAID IT ALL IN 50 PAGES.,"This book is much too long and redundant. The author keeps going over the same thing in basically the same words. It is overly dramatic and anti-climactic throughout and never seems to get to the point, nor does it give concrete details concerning the ordeal Mr. Cramer esperienced. The solutions are given in the last few pages. While the author hits upon some ineteresting points, he could have said it all in a 50 page booklet."
1,Doesn't play,"Got it - stuck it in the Macintosh - no directions - nothing opens to suggest what to do with the disk. I'll throw it out - thank goodness it was real cheap. Unless you're a computer genius or a seven year old child, don't buy this one."
5,Excellent bit!,"Very sharp, left a glass smooth finish on the sides of the recess that it was used to refine (I inlayed Kreg klamp trak into my workbench). The shank is longer than most pattern bits of its size, allowing it to be used slightly deeper than its 1/2 inch cutting length would suggest. It was able to easily clean out a 3/4 inch deep recess under a 1/2 inch plywood template (routing first with the template in place, and then with it removed), with plenty of shank in the collet. I highly recommend it!If you need even more reach with a top-bearing bit, take a look atMagnate 7621 Legacy Pattern Router Bits - 1/2"" Cutting Diameter; 1/2"" Cutting LengthandMagnate 7623 Legacy Pattern Router Bits - 3/4"" Cutting Diameter; 3/4"" Cutting LengthI have them on order for other projects."
4,shoes,Good shoe. Stylish and the kids can run fast in them. My sons want a shoe that is tight so that they can run. This fit the bill.
4,The origins of Zeppelin from the Yardbirds,"It was an informative DVD. It spoke at length with sessions and blues players from the British scene (late 1960s) about what the Yardbirds were about, how they reinvented themselves a couple of times with Clapton, Beck and then Page, and how they later gave rise to Zeppelin."
4,"Johhny Winter ""Captured Live""","This is vintage Winter at his best! It rocks from start to finish and the interplay between Johhny and second guitarist Radford is phenominal. This version of ""Highway 61"" is especially tasty."
5,Best Tool I've Bought!!!,"Great price for this tool and it allow me to tell my clients on the spot what their options allow them to purchase. Easy to use andvery compact, I would highly recommend this product!!!"
4,A different REO flavor,"I bought this album in '75 and unfortunately it's not on disc anymore. I always liked the different sound Mike Murphy brought to it. It gave Gary Richrath a chance to experiment more with his guitar playing. I love all 3 records with Murphy. A bit more funky at times, but Murphy's voice was unique. Looks like most of the reviews only heard the Cronin years. To bad for them. I would hope some record label will re-release ""This Time We Mean It"", on CD, like they did for ""Lost In A Dream"" and ""Ridin'the Storm Out"". Good Memories listening to the Murphy years. Check it out if you can find it on LP. Listen up, Cronin!"
4,NIXON NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD,"Frank Langella is a revelation as Nixon, he gives the man a depth that is often lacking in movies about Nixon, Im sure his two daughters never saw him as the monster he was often portrayed. I really had not expected to be so revited by a movie essentially about an series of interviews produced years ago by a celebrity interviewer for hire of a disgraced former American President, trying desperately to clear his name and replenish the old coffers as W. would say(Geez, how appropriate is that?). This is a movie that was always going to rise or fall on the performances of the two leads and it soars because the two actors are on top of their respective games and the supporting performances are well done as well and are essential to the flow of the movie. This was such a strong year for actors in a lead role and it's hard to say that Penn did not deserve his award, but wow, Langella gives a career performance in this movie. Highly recommended."
3,A Hollywood Interpretation of an Interview Anyone Can Watch For a Reality Check,"I watched this movie because I've always been interested in Richard Nixon and all of his contradictions. This movie is pretty forgettable. The actual interviews between Frost and Nixon are far more interesting. There are certain elements that you'll always see in a film by Ron Howard: (1) miraculously his no-talent brother Clint always gets a part (2) One of the characters will have an incredibly bad costume or make-up job. In this case, the guy playing Swifty Lazar looked more like a martian than a human being. (3) Most of the acting will be lame. (4) The viewer will be treated to several studied close-ups of the protagonists to reveal unnaturally profound insights that they're having (5) You always realize that you're just watching a movie, far removed from the way that people behave in the real world...."
3,Great for weeknight parties,"Have you ever been at work on a Wednesday and decided just to invite some people over for dinner on Friday? This is the book to pull out in just those situations.My inital concern was that this was going to be a pasta-only kind of thing. I mean the $50 limit can be a little intimidating. But no, there's everything in here for both carnivores and vegetarians. I made the dijon-sherry flank steak last night and it was tremendous!I love the fact that Sally obviously lives in the real world! Don't have time to marinate for 2 or 3 hours? She says fine, throw in in the fridge overnight and pull it out when you get home. Her menus are logical and easy to use. She even gives options of how to make adjustments whether you want to cook inside or out or even change a side dish.This is a great book for people (like me) who have trouble deciding what goes with what. It takes the guess work out of it. I really recommend it. Invite some people over. Have them bring wine!"
3,An interesting but orthodox analysis of racial concepts,"Using Black nationalism as the context, Dr. Austin's book considers some of the problematic aspects of prevailing sociological theories of race within academia. It is a rather orthodox deconstruction of racial theories that doesn't cover any new ground in the discussion of race or Black identity. It does, however, provide a fascinating and succinct history of Black nationalism."
5,Great hard drivin' stuff with plenty of emotion,Great hard drivin stuff--full of genuine emotion. These guys are givin' you the real thing and having a great time doing it.
5,"A landmark book. A ""must read"". A ""10"". An A+.",Every concerned citizen should read or at least scan this book and very carefully read and take to heart the conclusions and recommendations.
2,Far too narrow of a book,"Raising the Wind is the life's work of Professor Ernest J. Moyne. Indeed, it was not published until after his death in 1976. This book is an exhaustive list of literary references to the use of strings or bags to generate winds throughout history. Many references are given to stories mentioning Manx strings, Scottish strings, Finnish strings and Lapp strings.I found this to be a real boring book. I had hoped that this book might provide some stories about Finnish or Lapp wizards or folktales, but was profoundly disappointed. So, if you want a book mentioning (but not going into any depth) about the use of string to generate winds, then this book is for you. For anyone else, I would suggest that you don't bother with this book."
4,Chocolate fountain fun,"Great product. Easy to use, not loud at all. Real fun at parties. Highly reccomend."
5,Very Yummy!,"Had 10 teen girls over for a birthday. They all headed straight for the fountain and when they were dipping fruit and eating, it was the quietest moments of the evening. Wonderful product. Like a Zen fountain!"
2,The centerpiece of my party had some problems.,"I held a chocolate party. This was the centerpiece. Midway through the night the fountain started behaving badly - it made noise, it ""sheeted"" funny (meaning that there were parts where chocolate wasn't coming out right), and the fact that I had to mix my chocolate with oil meant that the chocolate tasted oily. All in all, everyone stared at it all night but hardly anyone used it. When I went to shut it down, it made a mess.Neat effect, but not for those who don't have practice with one of these things."
5,Chocolate fountain,I have used this at many gatherings and it has been a favorite of everyones. It is very sturdy and well made. It is a good size also. Clean up is messy and I suggest rinsing it off good before putting it in the dishwasher. the greasy chocolate sticks on it otherwise. Great party item for all ages.
1,Difficult to understand if not knowledgeable on the subject.,"To appreciate this book you'd have to have a few college classes on cosmology. Because I haven't this book put me to sleep. There is a lot of terms and diagrams, and unless you have a previous understanding of elementary particles and astronomy I don't recommend it."
4,Basic Understanding of Cosmology,This is a well written book for those unitiated in physics and cosmology. It was written before the Big Bang theory was revised to include inflation so some of the concepts are already obsolete. It is a good starting point however. I would recommend following it up with the Inflationary Universe by Alan Guth or The Universe in a Nutshell by Steven Hawkings.
1,Give it a miss...,"I love this movie but i cannot recommend the bluray as it's subtitles are incomplete, it completely skips lines of dialogue many many times throughout the whole film... disappointing to say the least."
5,The High Watermark for Kaiju Film.,"Gamera III, directed by Shusuke Kaneko and visual effects by Shinji Higuchi. Gamera III set the high watermark for visual effects in Japanese cinema. With a budget of only 7,000,000 Dollars, they managed to create fantastic action sequences that are orchestrated flawlessly. Some of the SFX are better than the American Version of Godzilla (1998). The movie has this epic tone that makes it seem more than just a monster movie flick. I have seen this movie countless times and I never seem to get tired of it. I recommend this to anyone, not just fans of Gamera or Godzilla. You will not be disappointed. If you are disappointed, I recommend seeking some mental help."
1,Better Chicana Writers to Choose From,"I read most of this book, but it was like pulling teeth. I was trying really hard to give this book of short stories a fair shake, but I had to put it down. What happened here? I happen to be chicana, but I cannot relate in any way to far-fetched, predictable and seemingly phony stories. This was a real stretch in creativeness and humor. Published chicana writing that is as poor as this lowers the standard for all chicana literature. We deserve better than this. Makes me wonder if she got published just because she seems like a good chicana ""product."" What does this say to the truly talented chicana writers out there? Sandra Cisneros, Esmeralda Santiago, Ana Castillo, Julia Alvarez and others - this fake, commercialized generation of chicana can't touch you."
1,Chock full of stereotypes,"How come every white character in this book is racist in some way? Surely somewhere in her journeys Ms. Serros must have run up against some intelligent, compassionate white people. But apparently not. Apparently all white people are either overtly or latently racist and they are all very very stupid. Good job Ms. Serros. You've so little self-esteem you must put down an entire race to raise yourself up. Well, I hope you feel better now."
2,Doesn't quite cut it,"I bought this bit in the hopes that I could miter cut some 0.8 mm laminate before gluing it to the material so I could get a proper corner joint and avoid the ugly black line that comes from straight trimming laminate. Sadly, it didn't work. The tolerances are just too tight and it's nearly impossible to keep the cut straight enough (even with the router table-mounted) to join the two seams. Plus, you've got the problem of needing to cut at least one side before gluing, which is tough to do well with laminate. Finally, the bit had a tendency to separate the clear coat from laminate a little.This bit would probably work well with a thicker, non-stratified, natural material. Sadly, that wasn't the use I intended it for, nor what the promotion indicates it is designed for, so I have to consider this an expensive failed experiment. Be warned."
4,the epitome of melancholy,"It's short. Somehow I didn't pick up on this, so it was disconcerting to have the thing end so soon. But that's not important. What's important is the vast glowing cloud of melancholy that emanates from this film. It's not despair... but it's not hope, either. It just is what it is. (The short about the girl and her cat -- told from the cat's point of view -- has the same magical quality.) When it was over I sat there motionless for several minutes, looking at the dark grey screen, with a quiet mind."
3,Sad and depressing,I love all kinds of Anime. The movie was to short and down right depressing. The end left open and left no real resolution of what happened to the characters. Graphics were good though. Story line was lacking.
3,Yo,"If you're deciding wether to buy this movie or not. DO NOT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! This is pathetic and sad. Its a copy of Gunbuster, minus character development, background storylines, in exchange for good animation and a story thats echo'd, well I should say stolen from Anime, all across the spectrum. I personally would have enjoyed a revamp'd version of Gunbuster had it been longer than 30 FREAKING MINUTES. It wsant even worth the 4$ I paid to rent it.Scenes that were similar to Gunbuster.The Starship Laser Firing sequenceThe Lone mecha against the single enemy capital ship.The Shields of the ""Tracer"" and the mech from Gunbuster.The design shape of the aliens.The scene of some sort of reactor looks exactly like the Gunbuster Warp generatorThe way the ships warpedThe way the mecha launchedThe organic appearance of the aliensThe shape of the capital ships"
5,Inevitably outstanding,"Shinkai's artistry never ceases to amaze, the clean-cut and starkly-yet-beautifully realistic scenery is so beautiful that you could take any background shot and make a powerful work of art with no editing whatsoever. This surely has a lot to do with the way Shinkai and his studio produce the art--one photograph at a time, redrawn by hand from scratch.The story is compelling, but can feel out of place without the proper contextual understanding of postwar Japan. I would definitely recommend a primer in postwar Japanese psychology/sociology to supply proper context to enjoy this masterpiece. Much of the symbology also revolves a bit around the issues that Japan dealt with postwar.All in all a powerful story with chillingly beautiful animation style that lends its full weight to the tale being told."
1,Beware products in foreign languages.,"When ordering a dvd from an English-language site, it would be reasonable to assume that it would contain English language dialogue or at the very least, subtitles in English especially when one knows that an English language version of the title is available. It mystifies me why a product with neither attribute is offered for sale in Amazon US or UK when there are Amazon sites specifically tailored to process products in foreign languages. At the very least, such dvds should have a notice right at the the top of the product entry informing us that it is not an English-language version or the title should be displayed in a foreign language. For me, ordering this useless article was a complete waste of time."
1,Piece O'...,"Being made by Interact, one would think it would be good, right? WRONG! This is junk. It [messes up] games, such as my Shenmue file, three Phantasy Star Online Characters and other games. PC link works poorly. Take my advice and buy the Official Sega 4X Memory Card. Thats a lot better."
3,"Great Photos, A Bit Tricky to Follow!","DK books are famous for their photos, and this is no exception. Each page for first aid, home emergency, or natural disaster has great descriptive pictures.However.....directions are given in a graph-type form. It's almost like an old DOS program with the ""if yes, if no"" commands. Not at all easy to follow in a real emergency! I like our book, but probably would not have bought it if I knew the directions required such concentration!!"
4,An unsung Classic,"Emile Gavreau paints an excellent picture in this classic book, about the truth behind wars and what goes on behind the scenes while battles are being waged. This book was written in 1944, so it is dated as far as relating to current issues, but it has so many ""gold nuggets"" from which to expound on for further research. The book deals with men like Pershing, Billy Mitchell, and Gutzon Borglum (of Mt. Rushmore fame). The book also deals with men like Sir Basil Zaharoff; who supplied both friend and foe with armaments during World War 2; and in turn made tremendous profits in the process. Fast forward to today, and you will find not much has changed."
2,good idea/failure to function,"I ordered this, inserted my media card, sent it to my mother and it worked exactly one month! Then it displayed PG-RGB NO SYNC.... I did all the usual repair attempts including new cards, etc... not worth the effort!"
3,Decent digital picture frame of larger format,"So far the product has performed as advertised. The complaints of premature failure had me worried, so I emailed customer Svc. They replied within 24 hours with a detailed explanation. Though we could regret the purchase, the general reviews and the encouraging responsiveness of the seller - and the fact that Amazon carries it - led us to try.We have seen much worse image quality on others and improvements in quality and size will no doubt occur rapidly; for now, a good alternative getting close to a reasonable price."
5,Loving this....,"Bought this as gift. It is a beautiful wood frame, with a great picture. The size and picture quality demands attention in any room. I highly recommend."
3,Digital Picture Frame 10.4 inch Portable USA,"Portable USA 10.4-Inch Digital Picture Frame (PU10W)Concept good BUT!The remote controls on both of the TWO products that I bought fail to control the digital display as advertised. Generally, one finds the whole process of attempting to navigate using the remote to be very frustrating and ultimately one gives up. Simple commands such as advance one picture are ok, but anything more than that, particularly switching between folders (directories) on the memory card are all but impossible. Contrast controls are not particularly good in dealing with varying exposures."
1,main character is a jerk,"The day his brother is buried, that evening Tom (the protagonist) is [messing around with] his brothers girlfriend.How's that for unprincipled. Not my kind of protagonist.The story and characters didn't impress me."
1,I guess it is cause by frustration,"The author was just totally frustrated day in and day out by the works, rebuttals and logical reasoning of Catholic apologists that made him look like from Middle school.If you are fair and honest read for yourself a good catholic book, ""Fundamentalism and Catholicism"" by Karl Keating and ""Not by Faith Alone"" by Sungenis thru Amazon."
3,A bit of a disappointment,When I opened the box I found that the packing material which was styrofoam sheets had broken into little tiny balls that literaly covered the product which was covered in a greasy coating. So it took forever to clean the item. Once I was able to get it together I found the following. The tilt function is wonderful but the small lip allows everything to roll off the edge and in my opinion although there are a few tilt settings only the first one is unusable anymore tilt than that and the slightest pressure would push the tray away from you. Also there is a bit of slop in the tilt locking so you have a tiny bit of wobble once locked in place. One of the pluses is the height which with the super high mattresses these days is a requirement. It would have been nice to have a split top so one part would hold a beverage and other items you didn't want to have to relocate when you wanted to tilt the table. And finally it can be a bit difficult to raise if your sitting in bed.
2,Lumex Deluxe Tilt Overbed Table,Table top had slight scratches & lock on wheel came broken. This company has a lot to learn about packing items & customer service.
4,A good item *IF* you're good at assembly!,"I like the table... the wood finish makes it looks nice, it's easy to raise/lower/tilt, and it's a good size for keyboard and mouse pad. However, my husband rated it ""even worse than the last thing"" I made him put together, which is saying something. The directions for assembly are horrendous. Proceed only if you have access to good assembly skills!"
3,Hard.,"This title is very addicting but they don't allow you to get very far without skill. I always thought these types of games were supposed to let you have some fun then they squeezed the blood out of you. Oh well, still fun."
5,Great cd!,"This is a great CD from Goldfrapp. I've been a fan since they came out in 2000 with FELT MOUNTAIN. I also really enjoyed their 2003 album BLACK CHERRY. In many ways, SUPERNATURE is a combination of the two albums, filled with some chillout tracks, and some electro-disco numbers that will get you moving on the dancefloor! The first single ""Oooh La La"" is a perfect example, same goes for the other singles ""Number 1"" and ""Ride A White Horse"", the latter being my favorite. Other highlights include ""Slide In"", ""Time Away From The World"", ""Satin Chic"", overall really the whole album is stellar!"
3,okay,It is fine. I guess I was expecting something REALLY 3 DIMENSIONAL but it is kinda just 2 dimensional. I guess it is worth the price though. The seller was great. No problems. No tricks.
1,Great TV film-- HORRIBLE DVD!!!,Find this on the SP mode VHS (not the EP release). This DVD has horrible sound !!! and picture quality!!! AVIOD! Someone remaster this one!
4,how to create a welcoming haven!,"Gardening and Landscaping On and Around Your Deck. How to surround your deck with spring flowers & fall berries, & fill it with flowers that will attract birds & butterflies, as well as create an edible landscape for yourself.Time to turn your deck into a place worth living in? Want to add a little Eden into your life?Barbara Ellis has the book for you!With gorgeous photographs & elegant drawings; lists of flowers that will attract wildlife; comparisons of different kinds of containers & trellises, & simple instructions on how to do almost anything with plants, DECKSCAPING is a must for anyone wanting to change that drab outdoor area into a welcoming haven for yourself & your wild life!"
4,Thoughtful and Practical!!!,"While I must admit to initial confusion about the specific direction this book was taking in the first 5 chapters, I found the ideas more concrete and helpful as I got into chapters 7-11. I'm not sure that I would have been able to read the later chapters with as much insight had I not wallowed, a bit uncertain, through the earlier chapters. I am very happy to have this book during the Christmas holidays -- a time for reflection and renewal! Richard"
4,Eye Opening,"Have to have and open heart and mind for this book, but if you do it will definitely take on a great journey. Has helped me immensely and is full of great quotes."
5,"""Care Of The Soul""","Thomas Moore has been my favorite author for nearly twenty years. My studies concerning the care of the soul began one year ago. I first read Dark Nights of the Soul which introduced me to going deeper in the subject. This book has given me insight into the daily feeding of my spirit which allows a deep reverance for the subject of how we take care of the soul. When Thomas Moore states that this is a Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness - it is much like digging in the garden of your life. This means maintenance of weeding, fertilizing and watering. This book is excellent for anyone who is working on finding more meaning out of life.The book had some minor markings made in pencil which I did not mind at all."
2,Too abstract,"The book is too repetitive, I didn't even make it halfway through. Personally, I think Mr. Moore's writing style is unexciting and removed all the fun I expected from the book. Personally, I just found myself getting bored reading this. He choose a good topic and has some good ideas, but I kept falling asleep from boredom."
4,Ray proves himself to be a great film-maker.,"Nick Ray has been forgotton by many and only remembered as 'the guy who directed ""Rebel Without a Cause""'. True, ""Rebel..."" is a great film, but it is by no way the best of Ray's films. This book gives a new-comer to Ray an intriguing glimpse at his moments of genius from the inside out, giving them a taste of his films and then making them desperate to see them. For a more informed veiwer it embellishes Ray's work, giving personal insight into the complex films. Ray shows that his belief in serious film making (which the French Cahiers du Cinema critics lauded as auterism) was committed and honest. The resulting films are wonderful and unique, as is this book, which is informative, fascinating and sometimes tragic. Read it."
4,A Must Read for Nick Ray fans!,"A great read for Nicholas Ray fans. A nice glimpse inside the man - his thoughts, his philosophy of film, and his battle with cancer. Highly recommended."
4,"captures life, times, and brotherly love","The book is a straight forward narrative of a gentle giant struggling to balance his extrodinary life during the tremendous and violent changes of the early and middle 20th century. Buddy Bear gives an intimate portrait of a man who is a physical colosus and at the same time an introverted, sensitive artist. Blessed and cursed with a brother (Max Baer) whose force of personaltity is so dominant, so unique, so bright, and yet so loving, Buddy's journey to find his own identity is the core of the book. He paints a rich picture of the fight game with its backdrop, the America of the 20's, 30's, and 40's and beyond. He depicts times and places as one who lived it, not as one who has merely researched it, and at times he does so with a simple, beautiful poetry."
4,Class book,I was particularly happy to find this book on your website since I am taking a class from the author and needed the book. I was able to purchase it for a discounted price. It looks like a book with great instructions that are clear and easy to follow. I look forward to my class and have chosen to make the Star and Hourglass quilt which is one of the patterns in the book.Janet
2,Obscure drab looking blocks....,"I purchased the original Nickel Quilts book and loved it! And so you can imagine my delight when I received ""More Nickel Quilts"" in the mail. The concept of Nickel quilts is quite unique- all blocks therein are composed of 5 inch squares. This worked great in the first book, which had quite a few really awesome patterns, but I think in the second book, this concept is stretched a little thin.With the exception of shoe fly, most of the blocks were just repetitive and eye-numbing. Patterns which are easy to see shrunk down on the page don't necessarily make great quilts for bedspreads. Overall, I found this book disappointing. If you have a chance, pick up Nickel Quilts. This was an awesome book. I think with ""More Nickel Quilts""....The author just ran out of ideas. I'd recommend browsing this book before buying, to make sure you like the blocks."
4,Nice Songs,"This is a nice collection of music from various singers. Through the Eyes of Love is in a more jazzy style, with a saxophone, which isn't really my style, but I like most of the songs. My personal favorites are ""You Were Falling in Love With Me,"" ""I Will Believe,"" and ""Daughter of Zion."" The songs are full of emotion and various instruments. I have not yet read the Zion Chronicles series--that would surely add a whole new and interesting dimension to the songs."
5,It absolutely does the job,"The old flapper was worn and every 30 minutes or so it would sound as if the toilet was flushing on its own. Took the great advice of a plumbing site devotee, who suggested that putting Vaseline on the bottom of the flapper would stop the flushing. Yes, it worked. But there's nothing like doing what you're supposed to do: replace a worn part. The flapper arrived, not too difficult to replace, and everything works like new. (The toilet is a discontinued Kohler Rosario)."
5,Really nice watch,"This is the first higher quality watch I have bought. I got tired of throwing away $40 to $50 on black plastic watches that barely last a year. This one is outstanding. It's very durable. There has yet to be a scratch on the face of it, and I wear this thing all the time, from yardwork to working on my car to working out, and nothing has scratched it yet. It's very accurate, and very attractive, I get a lot of comments on it."
3,A tentative debut from a beautiful singer,"Jennifer Kimball was always a sublime complement to Jonatha Brooke back in their days as The Story. Her voice is as versatile, but more delicate than Brooke's, and she harmonizes like almost no other. VEERING FROM THE WAVE unfortunately doesn't distinguish her artistically enough from Brooke who has forged ahead with gusto in her solo career. Kimball's songwriting seems to be modeled on Brooke's (who wrote all of The Story's music) and there is a sameness to the lovely sounds in each song on this album. The best song on it, in my opinion, is Kimball's excellent cover of Crowded House's FALL AT YOUR FEET. For die hard fans of The Story, this is still a must have. Kimball is a real talent, and she may very well have better work up here sleeve. This one is solid, but not extraordinary."
5,"Feeling ""...the Wave""","The Story remains one of my favorite bands. Jonatha Brooke went her direction, and so did Jennifer. The sound of The Story came through for me more with this CD than did any of Jonatha Brooke's. (Not to say anything pejorative about Jonatha Brooke's CDs, they're merit-worthy for their own reasons -- I have all of them!)Jennifer Kimball's melodic voice and terrific lyrics make this a wonderful listen. This CD made me truly wistful that there are only two available CDs from The Story."
4,Fine pop-folk music with interesting twists and turns,"Jennifer Kimball had up to now been considered the ""other half"" of the duo group The Story she formed with Jonatha Brooke. But while Brooke's albums have become more conservative lately, Kimball's is a pleasant suprise.Her songwriting reveals that she has as much to contribute as Jonatha Brooke did. Her beautiful voice and turns of phrase remind one initially of older Suzanne Vega (with more control) and Shawn Colvin (but not as whiny) and repeated listenings reveal complex harmonies and chancey use of dissonance, more like XTC.Overall, a beautiful record. Probably my favorite of the genre."
2,Not so good,"Just rented this movie last night, it was a let down as far as good holiday movies go. The only thing going for it was it was pleasant enough I wasn't ashamed to have the kids watch it, it was just bland and boring. Movies like ""A Christmas Story"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"", and ""(The) Santa Claus"" are much more entertaining and can also be watched by young children.Also, didn't realize it was a made-for-TV movie, but it was pretty obvious as I watched it since it had the darkening scenes you always notice right before the commerical break, yuk."
2,Disappointing!,"Like other reviewers, I want the MOVIE soundtrack. The changes to ""I Hate People"" are terrible. Who knew Albert Finney's singing would be better than Anthony Newley's? Bob Crachit's ""Christmas Children"" is a huge letdown. This is a musical--why didn't they get people who could sing?"
4,French Fun: The Real Spoken Language of Quebec - Steve Timmins,"This is a good book to take along to Montreal and Quebec while touring parts of Canada. French Canadian is somewhat different from the French spoken in France and Louisiana, so it can help with the differences. Also entertaining."
4,"good ""phone"" but...","... just so-so for other things.My primary complaint is that the keyboard is too SMALL. Typing anything more than 2 sentences is very difficult. I switched from the sidekick II to buy this phone and I think it was a mistake. Dialing phone numbers is easy but typing instant messages and emails are a pain. I really miss having one letter per key. My other complaint is that the service is too expensive for what you get. The sidekicks are cheaper, easier to use and have more features."
4,Good phone...lots of buttons and handy features.,Great phone. The calander is handy. The only downfall is that you cant create video messages or recieve video messages. The keyboard is great for text messages. The phone does take some getting use to. It seems more complicated then your average cell phone.
5,Best phone I've had,"I've been using the pearl for around 3 months and have been very happy with it. I get 3 different email accounts on the phone including my clender from work. The keyboard is a little tough to use, but its a fair tradeoff for size. The phone has some great features like mp3 and video. I usually keep 2-3 full length movies in case I am stuck waiting in line or on a plane. The internet connection isn't super fast, but its adequite to get maps or do searches. Physically, I think this is the nicest looking phone on the market. Super sharp screen and a nice feel. I recommend this phone to anyone."
2,One MAJOR problem,"Overall I love my Blackberry Pearl. It's easy to use, convenient, small and now I only have to carry one device. It does, however, have one MAJOR problem. Since I bought it 6 months ago, I have had to get it replaced twice, both for the same problem. The handset speaker stops working. In a call the person I'm talking to can hear me but I can't hear them. I take good care of my phone, have never dropped it, gotten it wet, etc. so there is no excuse for it to stop functioning like this, especially after so short a time. I'm definitely not going to get another one of these!!"
4,"Great phone, with battery cover problem (which T-mobile and Blackberry both unwilling to address)",I got my BlackBerry Pearl about 3 weeks back and I like it a lot. The interface is good and intutive. Voice quality is good. Works good even on weak signal.I noticed an irritating problem with battery compartment cover within a few days. The battery cover is loose and keeps on slipping off. I called T-mobile but they said they don't have any replacement covers and I will have to keep it as such. They also mentioned that I should contact BlackBerry if its a manufacturing defect. I wrote to BlackBerry and they replied that I should either contact T-mobile or I can get FEE BASED support. The only option I am left with is to use a peice of cello tape to keep the cover from slipping off. I guess that is pretty bad customer service for a product in this price range.
4,"Great phone so far, with minor problems","This phone is my first blackberry; my aging ATT samsung was shot, and I dreaded the idea of converting to Cingular anyway, things fell together naturally. Got a great deal on Amazon--this phone is over $200 bucks direct from T-Mobile.T-mobile customer service was fantastic and got my number switched over within 24 hours.The only reason I didnt give this 5 stars is related to posts below. Since getting the phone I have had to reset it by removing the battery once, which I feel is unacceptable in a device such as a phone. I realize that phones are becoming more sophisticated, and the blackberry's even more so, but come on!"
4,Got the flu?,"Interesting words from the inside of the money machine. Addictions, aside from the accumulation of wealth, as well as the means to disguise them. Intriguing...... This book covers the whole enchilada."
4,"Not there best, but.......","I have most if not all of Loggins and Messina's work. Together, I feel they did their best work. This album was not a chart topper but has some of the best stuff they ever did. Pretty Princess puts chills up my spine everytime I hear the horns in it. I have had this record for years and am finally upgrading to a CD. If you don't have this album and are a fan, you should buy it. You will be very happy you did."
3,Christmas in Wonderland,"Movie is so-so, but thanks for sending it, and glad it was in good condition. Thanks."
2,Sad,This movie is pretty bad. Most of the acting is terrible and the plot is paper thin. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Unless you have to see Patrick Swayze in one of his last movies. It's sad it had to be one this crappy.
5,Christmas in Wonderland,Love to see Patrick Swayze act. This is a very good Christmas movie. I have a going collection now and this will make a great addition. I love all about Christmas so I enjoyed the movie and all the music. This seller will certainly be one of my favorites.
1,Egregious....,"Since ""horrible"" and ""atrocious"" have already been used to describe this movie, I'll go ahead and toss ""egregious"" into the hat. This movie is neither funny nor entertaining.Even reliable talent like Swayze or Curry (both in subpar performances) can help this dreck. The writing is terrible and the acting is forced.This film is the worst holiday seasonal movie that I can think of - it's just awful."
5,"An ""Un-Sung"" Triumph","I will not say that I am the biggest Dan-Fan, but I like to think so. Of all of Dan Fogelberg's albums (yes, I own this on vinyl, cassette & cd)this one has one my favorite songs: These Days. Over the years, I , a musician myself, have covered many singers & their songs, but this song has grown along with me. I either perform it at the beginning of a performance, or as my closer! I was sorry NOT to see it appear on the Portrait box-set. This album, along with Home Free, are the least known, yet i find that this is the most well thought out of ALL of Dan's records. All I can say, Dan, if you ever read this is ""These Days, are just like you and me!"""
3,Just misses the fourth star for me...,"I remember listening to this for the first time and being puzzled because there weren't any ""tunes"".Well, I was wrong about that of course, but you do need to listen a few times before you hear them. Some songs like the title track, sound a bit clunky at first, and to be honest, never quite lose it.And Man in the Mirror/Below the surface is just a throw away - two half-songs strung together to no great effect.BUT the rest is fine. Old Tnnessee is a classic DF track, Crow is pleasingly spooky and The Last Nail the best song on the album, and a good place to finish."
2,"Decent power extension, and the only one in its form fact","The power works, the usb hub does not. That's all there is to it. If you intend on buying this for a power extension in a good form factor, buy the two-socket version, forget the usb hub. Also buy a set of 3m sticky feet. If that's what you're after, you'll be happy with this product."
1,"No driver, USB doesn't work","The AC power plug works, but the USB ports do not. There is no driver for this device; looked around and didn't find one. Don't know if I need one, but in any case the USB ports don't work. So essentially I have a short extension cable for an AC power plug."
5,Red Chili Fettuccinne,"This product is great - looks, cooking time and taste. Have been using it foryears. My wife has dish adding chicken and mushrooms to this that is fabulous!Once tried Red Chili Fettuccinne will be a ""must have"" in your pantry."
4,Gwendolyn Hilliard's textbook experience,I needed books for summer school. I tried Amazon.com because I had heard so much about it from other students. At first I was a little leary because it was a company I had no experience with. But I took a chance and was surprisingly happy. I ordered the books around May 7th or so and they were due on June 2nd. They arrived within the same week of ordering them. Of course I was pleasantly surprised that they were so quick. I can say that I had a very good experience with Amazon.com and I hope to do more business with this company. Gwendolyn Hilliard
5,cord,It is a cord - it came in the mail when it was supposed to - it works - what is there to review?
2,The Best of all Bible Study DVD's,"I have purchased Ray Vander Laan Faith Lessons before, and I can't praise the product enough. Our Bible Class enjoys the sights and the messages each lesson brings. Plus a plaudit for the legendary service I always receive from Amazon on each order I place."
3,Good Starting Point,This is a good starting point for sampling the early Poco hits.You can hear the early Eagles influences in this material.
2,Fluff anyone?,"This book is pretty pathetic. There are a few feats and a few prestige classes I might use in it, but its mostly a waste of time. The only thing I think that stands out for me are the racial substitution classes. The new race, the Goliath (can anyone think of a better name? Yeah, just about anyone could)is a waste of time.I've seen where you can get all three of the race books in one box set. I can't imagine the shock of the buyer after picking up these three books and realizing how much money he wasted. I bought this one used for $7, so I figure its worth that much for the pictures and little I'll use."
5,Perfect for challenging the Tenor,"Practice is how a singer improves and Puccini is a challenging composer. The backing tracks are excellent and if there is any complaint some of the tracks are played in a fairly slow tempo. This, instead of making them easier make them more challenging but they may be a bit slower than you are used to practicing.Recommended for any Tenor who wants to push themselves a little with the feeling of a full orchestra backing you up."
3,Not what everyone makes it out to be,"This is often touted as the best Aerosmith album, but it falls short of that mark by far. If you really want their best go and pick up ""Rocks"" as well as ""Get Your Wings"". To be fair some of the songs that I don't like seem to be popular among other fans. I could do without Uncle Salty, Adam's Apple, Big Ten Inch Record, You See Me Crying, and even Walk This Way. What's left is nothing short of phenomenal, but it is less than half the album. I seem to be in the minority when it comes to this, so if you like Aerosmith you will probably really like this one. I just can't help but feel like this one is missing something important."
5,Definitive rock-n-roll,"With this album and Rocks (this album being the superior of the two), Aerosmith staked thier claim to being THE rock band of the seventies. Lots of sleaze (Uncle Salty, Adam's Apple), lots of funk (Walk This Way, No More No More), lots of sexual innuendo (Big Ten Inch Record). All this, and I still haven't even mentioned the title track or the timeless ""Sweet Emotion"". Great stuff, the album's only flaw is that it makes the rest of their career pale in comparison."
5,Greatest Hard Rock Album Of All Time,"That's what Toys In the Attic is. Every single track is signiture Aerosmith rock n roll magic. If your new to Aerosmith's music, this is a good album to start with because it really shows there true colors, unlike Big Ones. Toys In the Attic was the album that broke Aerosmith into the mainstream with songs like ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Walk This Way."" But if you've heard enough of these songs, despite their masterpiecefulness (I love making up words,) as I am, there are AWESOME songs like the title track, Uncle Salty, Adam's Apple, No More No More, and Round and Round that are simply classic. If you dont have this album, you gotta get it, its as easy as that."
4,classic album -- deserved to be a breakthrough,"It's easy for the casual fan to focus on the hits ""Walk This Way"" and ""Sweet Emotion,"" even those who came to discover this band after RUN-DMC remade that song the way I did. But listen to deeper cuts like ""No More No More,"" ""Adam's Apple,"" and the racy ""Big Ten Inch Record"" and you'll realize that this band, whether in this early version or its modern day, is a great rock 'n' roll band."
2,a very bad album,"Toys in the Attic is an overrated, overplayed disaster.The only decent songs are the title track and ""Uncle Salty"". ""Walk This Way"" has a unique vocal melody for the time it was released in the mid 70's, but that doesn't mean I like it. ""Big Ten Inch"" sounds like some fake novelty song that wears thin after a couple listens.""Sweet Emotion"" is a decent song, but the live versions are MUCH better because the song demands a lot of energy, which this studio version lacks. ""No More No More"" is Aerosmith's version of a pop song, and an unmemorable one at that. ""Round and Round"" is a rip-off of Black Sabbath's ""Sweet Leaf"" and for some reason, a hard rock band thought it was a good idea to end an album with a ballad called ""You See My Crying"", complete with overdramatic emotions that sound forced and unreal.Aerosmith is a pretty fantastic band, but Get Your Wings is the place to start. Or buy that live album released in the late 70's."
2,Too many typographical errors,"This book needs a good copyediting and proofreading job. It is full of typographical errors that sometimes make it impossible to understand. The author chose an environmental example to illustrate the use of Java classes. Why not a practical business example? Perhaps if the publisher were to issue a new edition with some serious copyediting to improve the writing and correct the errors, the book would be more useful."
5,Luv em!,"I can't find these in many places. Excellent, smooth, & the 24 pak is ideal size . I will purchase more when I run out!"
5,beautiful noise,best neil i ever bought .and i have 99% of them.yes i would recommed this to everybody. lisson to it almost daily
5,Beautiful Noise CD,"Excellent, as always. Some great new songs. Caught his concert In Seattle, WA this summer then flew on to Calif to see the Concert in San Jose. Have seen him in previous years. Both tickets were Birthday presents! Neil is 11 days older than I. Tobe honest I do not have the stanima....especially to sing for two hours with no break.....Cordy"
5,What A Beatiful Noise!,"On this CD, Neil Diamond hooks up with The Band's Robbie Robertson, who produced this melodic and sentimental array of compositions. Here, the most ardent ND fan will find heartwarming ballads (If You Know What I Mean, Home Is A Wounded Heart, Lady-Oh), good-time standards (Stargazer, the title track, Jungletime) and the feel-good ""Don't Think...Feel"". Robertson also contributes musically here, playing guitar on songs like the equally touching ""Dry Your Eyes"". Robertson's ""The Band"" mates (Garth Hudson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel) also perform on this CD as well, which gives the songs here diverse arrangements of musical styles. All fans of either ND or The Band should add this CD to their collections. ""Check it out!"""
4,Dry your eyes,"As most of you who have read my reviews know I am a bigNeil Diamond fan.(in fact its the only thing my EX sister in law and I ever agreed on). ""Beautiful noise"" is one of the best!My favorite cut is ""Dry your eyes""! According to a recent interview with the man, the title came from one of his daughters. Well worth a listen!"
1,Waste of good money!!!!!!,Bought these boots from another sports chain store and they lasted about one month. The upper rubber part started to leak water in the seams. I have purchased other rubber boots in the pasted with no issues. Stay away from these boots.
3,Hampton Bay Space Saver with Glass Doors,"We ordered this unit for a beach home guest bathroom to give us some extra storage space. The shelves are deep enough to hold tri-folded bath towels, hand towels and washcloths, so it serves its purpose. The overall look is very nice, but the doors just don't quite meet in the center, no matter how you try. It was about a two-hour project to put together. For the price, it's a nice unit, just wish the doors hung correctly!"
4,Anticipation Was Not Rewarded by Complete Satisfaction,"This eagerly awaited (by me) follow-up to ""Bring It On"" is a well-crafted and enjoyable listen but breaks little new territory from the first album. Obviously the boys had a little extra money to spend in the studio on this effort, but the songs are not as catchy. ""Devil Will Ride"" is a nice concert sing-a-long with the Peter Frampton mouth wa-wa. Caught them in concert in LA -- very worthwhile. If you LOVED the first album, this is worth having -- if not, buy the first album first and see what you think. Also, the two tracks on the English import single of Bring It On (Dire Tribe & M57) would be worthy additions to either album. Still, an original band with an appealing pop/folk/Lou Reed/uncategorizable groove."
2,boring hyped stuff,"GOMEZ - Liquid Skin (HUT, 1999) I have not figured out the greatness in this band. Sure I think it's a rather cool band in their unique style of being. It's a mixture of old farts like Neil Young, The Band and such oldies with newcomers like Beck, Self, Arnold and hell know what else. Sure - cool - but still nothing that gets me real horny to hear more. ""Hangover"" is a good tune though...."
2,oh my goodness....,"Instead of sacking the bloke with the nasty, hoarse, Cookie-Monster voice, the band members let him sing on just about every song! Hearing him yell ""bring it on!"" or howl ""blue moon rising!"" is ridiculous. The other vocalist has a better voice and should have taken over the singing duties. What a waste."
5,The best CD ever,"When you see Gomez live, you truly understand that everything that has been said about this band is true. Words cannot describe how good they are live. Liquid Skin doesn't hit as immediately as Bring It On (the album) does, but in the long run, this has so much more for the patient listener. Highlights for me include the country-western tinged Hangover, the amazing vocals of Ben and Ian in Rhythm & Blues Alibi, the psychedelica of Revolutionary Kind and the dreamy We Haven't Turned It Around. Only miss for me is Fill My Cup. Look for Ben's howling ""Bluuuueeeee Mooooonnnn Riiiiissssinnng"" and beautiful Rosalita, the story of which many can definitely relate to. Less bluesier than Bring It On, but more diverse - enjoy a relaxing listen with headphones and a Coopers Ale to blow your mind."
2,For an experienced historian,"Becoming Citizens was a good book about the plight of women in California. It is filled with great detail and a lot of well researched facts. However, it is not a book for a novice historian. Being a US History major, I found myself lost with the lack of explaination on the women's plight. It is a great book to use as a reference for a larger term paper or thesis, bnut not for the average reader."
4,A transition album turned last album,"Tommy BolinPrivate Eyes (CD of 1976 album)Tommy Bolin was an excellent musician and every performance is precious. This being his final work, it is a shame that it comes across as a transition album rather than a magnum opus. Still, this one contains some really fine music and any collection would enhanced by it inclusion.This CD is an economy version from Columbia and it only has a single foldout cover card. This CD deserves a booklet and it is a shame that it does not have one.I've struggled with what to rate this one. It is Tommy Bolin, and it is his last album, but it is not his best album. I have to give this one Four Stars, but I still want to encourage you to get it."
4,Tommy final hours,"sweet burgundy is one of my fave song since I was a kid,... 70's rock essential,...Tommy was always one of the best rock guitar player. This cd is my fave one,...always and only!"
5,ITS NOT TEASER- BUT ITS THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUM EVER,there are 3 wonders of the recorded medium. 1. Teaser 2. Private Eyes 3. Come Taste the BandTake your pick- Tommy Bolin delivers like no-one else ever did.
4,A great player in his final days.,"It's sad that Bolin had to pass so soon after this release. Although not his finest stuff, this collection still evokes the power of his guitar work, if not his songwriting capabilities. It's still a keeper.Tommy's singing is real good here. He never got enough credit for his singing. Such a distinct voice, you know Tommy when you hear him sing anywhere.If you want an intro to Bolin, this is a good starting point. Such a burning talent with so little a legacy."
4,"Definitely the weakest of the trilogy, but furthers the plot","This one was 'okay.' Allows the valet more of a role, and shows Darcy's lingering focus on Elizabeth. It furthers the plot, but definitely is the weakest of the three. Usually, in rereading the series, I reread the first, and the third book, and skip this one. Still, I appreciate the writing, which stays fairly true to Regency style, and appreciate the creation of additional characters that don't cause the original characters to completely veer off of their original personalities."
3,Not as good as the others,"This one was my least favorite of the three books in the trilogy. The drama seemed a little contrived, if not a little melodramatic. That being said, it was still an interesting proposal of what Darcy did between his failed proposal at Rosings and meeting Elizabeth again at Pemberley."
4,Great retelling of Pride and prejudice,I read all three of the books in this series. The author gave a great insight into Mr. Darcy's thoughts.
2,won't read 3rd based on 2nd,"This was a waste of time. The first book was promising and lead me to believe the second would be better, but it wasn't. I do agree with another reviewer that the relationship with Darcy and his valet was interesting. Getting insight into Darcy was nice, and seeing his struggle with Elizabeth was as well, but turning him into 'every man's man' by having him save young ladies and solve mysteries was ridiculous."
3,Ok not as good as 1st and 3rd book,"I found myself skipping over parts of this book. It isn't very true to ""my Darcy"". I think you could skip over this one and just read An Assembly Such as This and These Three Remain."
3,If you've ever wondered...,"If you've ever wondered ""when, exactly, did Mr. Darcy realize he was falling for Elizabeth?"" then this book holds your answer. ""Duty and Desire"" is a gift to anyone who has ever wondered whether Mr. Darcy felt more than mere attraction for Elizabeth by the time he left for London, what his thoughts and struggles were, and what he did to keep himself from following the path he had so opposed for his friend, Bingley. The writing is gripping (though maybe a bit more passionate than one would expect in an Austen continuation) and some of the new characters were very intriguing. There were some lengthy sections where I found my interest flagging, and there were times when I was concerned that Mr. Darcy was becoming someone I wouldn't want to know in real life, but on the whole, this is by far the best treatment of P&P from Darcy's point of view that I've ever read."
4,"Mr. Darcy, Gentlemanlike","This novel stands almost independent of the Pride and Prejudice roots. There is no interaction with Elizabeth Bennet. However, there is a ripping mystery, and some really quite good introspections on the nature of faith, obligation, and duty.If you are allergic to Christianity, this book will probably give you hives, because Darcy is unapologetically a believer.Not so much a romance as a country-house story."
4,An Intriguing Novel,"I absolutely adored Aidan's first book, An Assembly Such as This; therefore, I greatly anticipated the second installment and was not disappointed. The book is superbly written and the characters very well developed.The novel takes place during the point of Pride and Prejudice where Darcy is not present so there really is nothing in P&P; to compare the story to. My main problems with Duty and Desire are that the plot is a bit far-fetched and really not like Austen at all. Then again, Austen didn't write it. Also, there were a bunch of grammatical mistakes and Aidan has a fondness for spelling ""choose"" ""chuse"" which is a bit disconcerting. The strongest aspect of the book is its portrayal of Darcy. His strengths and weaknesses are explored and his behavior among his peers brings insight into his character.Overall, it's a very good book and I can't wait to read the final installment."
3,Almost But Not Quite!,"After reading ""An Assembly Such As This - Book 1,"" I couldn't wait to begin reading Book 2 ""Duty and Desire."" I wasn't really disappointed, but I felt this book dragged and towards the end it became a little gothic and out of the way. In this book - after Mr. Darcy made a fool of himself by proposing to Elizabeth and being rejected, he decides to remove himself from her and forget that most terrible ordeal forever. Believing that a man of property such as himself was in need of a wife, he sets out on a visit, by invitation, to an old college friend's estate. There he meets the lovely, but mysterious Lady Sylvanie and becomes infatuated with her haunting beauty. Little does he know that lurking behind that facade is a deadly secret."
1,Skip This Book; Read the First and Third,"I am probably one of the least critical book readers ever and have never been as disappointed in a book as I was with ""Duty and Desire: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman."" I found it to be on the level of what I would expect to read on a fan-fiction website, complete with a classic 'Mary Jane' character.I absolutely loved the first and third books of this series and wish I had simply skipped this book."
1,Pretty much what I expected,"I started reading this series of books with a jaundiced eye -- no one could possibly even begin to do Jane Austen justice. But I had a gift certificate to spend, so with nothing to lose, and very low expectations, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the first volume, but this second volume is more what I thought I'd get. Ms. Aidan's story could easily have been told in two volumes, with this book left out of the series altogether. The plot is highly improbable, and there is no character development to speak of. Jane Austen might have gotten a laugh out of ""An Assembly Such as This"", but ""Duty and Desire"" surely must have her spinning in her grave.There's supposedly a third volume... if I could find it, I'd read it, in the hope that it would bear out the potential of the first volume."
2,An Unnecessary Filler Novel,"Duty and Desire: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)This book would have been so much better without the tedious murder mystery that dominates the second half. Maybe if Scooby Doo and the gang had shown up I would have liked it more."
4,What's with all the controversy?,"Ok, honestly a good book, and one that I would read again, but I did enjoy the first book more. Still overall, well written and enjoyable. For those who complain about the 'Christian moralizing' all I have to say is that it is Georgiana who has the change, not Darcy, but something other than just realizing he was a jerk needed to turn him around. Whether you believe in God or not, the people of that time did, so it is logical that this would be a focus in Darcy's life. Get over it. Maybe you're so hung up on it because it brought out something in your life that you didn't want to see. Deal with it. That's what great writing does, it makes you see a part of yourself in it, it does not guarantee you will like what you see.Ms.Aidan, Thank you, it's been a wonderful series and I cannot wait for the third book."
3,Just Waiting for the Third One,"Well, i must confess this book was not as good as the first. I think that it served its purpose, to fill in the time gap that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth do not meet. The parts of the book that made me smile were the parts when he was thinking of Elizabeth. The other parts of the book made me wonder.The mystery seemed out of place. It seemed to be used as a diversion rather than showing Darcy's true life. I was looking forward to his conversations with the sweet Georgiana from Pride and Prejudice and found that he spent most of his time worrying about her new found religious past-time.I almost want to just skip the second book and move to the third one with which i await with happy anticipation. The third book encompasses my favorite part of Pride and Prejduice.Although the book was not up to par with what i had hoped, i still recommend you read it as an ""in between"" the good parts."
3,No need to Buy,"This was an okay book, but it had no relevence to the rest of the series. I agree with another reviewer that this was just a filler book and that there is no need to read it. I will admit that it was well written and I would have enjoyed the story a little more if it had been a book all by itself and not part of this series."
2,Not My Mr. Darcy,"This dragged from cover to cover and I skipped over a lot of it. I'm sorry I read it. I've been in love with Fitzwilliam Darcy for years, but now I'm not so sure. It made him a prig and a fop. The first book didn't convince me that there were any true sparks between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth was only a lovely face with flashing eyes. She showed no profound wit to excuse such a fastidious man falling in love with her. During the second book I kept wanting to warn her to marry Mr. Collins."
3,Not as good as book 1 and 3,"In Austen's Pride and Prejudice Mr. Darcy pretty much disappears in middle book, and the book is the weaker for it. Here in Aidan's second book of the Trilogy we get to see what Mr. Darcy does between the Netherfield Ball and Rosings. I enjoyed the London back story and the interaction with Georgianna, Dy and, especially his valet Fletcher, but I think this book is the weakest of the three. Found myself pushing through it, especially the mystery at the end, and longing for a reunion with Elizabeth. Overall I really enjoyed the trilogy. And I think you need to read book two before proceeding to book 3, but it just wasn't as delicious as it's bookends. Entertaining, intelligent companion books to P & P."
1,Shocked and disappointed,"I was very shocked and disappointed when I flipped through the pages and saw the topic, ""How do they make crack from cocaine?"" The telling of the whole process is even more shocking when it ends with saying how crack is a better alternative to cocaine because its street value is cheaper and the effects are quicker and more direct than using powder cocaine.Other topics of concern are about condoms and drug addiction therapy using acupuncture. Seriously, are these things that kids are wondering about these days?"
5,Liked it enough to remember the name 10 years after lost it,"I liked it enough ten years ago, and then I lost the copy. Picked it up, Still love it. The plots are great, the detail behind the charectors are great. (The idea of humanoid martiens is no longer one ppl think of-thanks star trek of the 60's but your realm is over!)But the world that is uncovered in the book is one of dreamy imagination, and the 60's peace and love theme is shown at the beginging. Its like a really good scifi love story LOL"
3,"BAD MASTERING, BUT FRESH HOPE!!!!","I have loved this album for years, and finally got myself the CD because my vinyl is kind of worn down. My frustration comes from the fact that when they mastered this album for CD they didn't get the speed/pitch exactly right--the CD is about a quarter-tone flat (or more) from the original recording, which makes the tempos drag and her voice sound darker than it really is. (It is not that my turntable runs too fast, folks--I've timed it and it's running correctly.) Sigh, this happens sometimes when not enough care is taken in the CD mastering of something.UPDATE as of Aug 6, 2011: SONY has remastered this album at the correct speed!! It's available from Sony and shipped from Japan, but it is well worth it! I pre-ordered my copy, which arrived this week, and WOW what a great mastering job, and at the right speed with the pitch completely accurate. I'm in heaven listening to it!!"
2,Weakest Biosphere album to date,"After the great Cirque and Szhenzou, this is a big disappointment. This is very minimalist - which could be good - but is poorly done. Tracks that should be brief seem to go on forever. Drones that do not compel never shift or change to something more interesting. Stars of the Lid does minimalist and keeps it fascinating. I'm afraid that Biosphere has gone down the wrong road with this one."
5,"If you liked the movie, you will love the book!","I think the Outlaw Josey Wales is one of the best movies ever. So I read the book it is based on (Gone to Texas), and if anything it is even better than the movie. There are just enough differences to make it interesting, while enough alike to make you cheer! The second book, THe Vengence Trail of Josey Wales, was a little less readable, but good nevertheless. A bit more violent and bloody too. IF you like westerns, you will love this book. I highly recommend it!"
5,Ye be Josey Wales?,"Awesome book! The book is close to the movie but the author has a way of painting a picture of the old west brilliantly. The Vengeance Trail of Josey Wales should have been made into a movie WITH the Clint Eastwood character. It compliments Gone to Texas very well. Two great books, finished them in 3 days. Couldn't put them down."
3,"Low quality, nice color","This was the perfect color for my daughter's princess room, and a relatively low price. But, the fabric is very thin and tears easily. Especially when used in a young child's room. When she crawls into bed, her foot tears the fabric since it's so thin."
2,Difficult,"I think this book has potential to be a great help in learning the language. But, if you're like me, someone who is trying to learn alone, it might be too advanced. The vocab section helps, but the book moves too quickly in the written form of the language."
3,It's fine for me...,"I think this book is more for those who already have a little knowledge of French because it has, in my opinion, practice a little more complex ... I have not finished studying yet, but I think that I will need a tutorial ... Good luck!"
5,french learning,Very usefull for anyone with a little bit of knowledge of basic french. Easy to use and to understand. It has a lot of exercices and it has a great quality/price ratio!
5,Great!,"I am a learning French in college and my professor speaks in French the whole class. Whenever I don't understand something, I grab this book and it explains the topic thoroughly and in a way that helps me understand. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Great book for self-learning,"I got this book for my son, who used to take French is school, and now is employed and wanted to improve his French. He's really pleased with the level of readings, with the methodical progress, and the overall layout of the book. I highly recommend!"
2,More info needed,I purchased this stand alone expandable fence for privacy issues. Just needed something to block headlights at night from coming into a second floor apt. I so far like it. I also so hung a table cloth across it to secure privacy and I am happy. my issues is with the screws. The area is to small for fingers to get into the tighten bolts. if they can figure out a way I would give it a 10 rating.
3,Not assembled?,"This is weird. I received this in the mail. Opened the package and noticed that the amp was rattling. I took a screwdriver and opened the case to realize that none of the electronics components were soldered to the board! Is this a DIY kit, because it's not advertised as such. I'd imagine that it was just a case of very poor quality assurance. In any case, I returned this for a full refund. It looked very cool and I wish it was put together. I ended up buying the Purple Sparkle version, and am very happy with it."
1,No Luck with Siniper Elite,Game would not install and never ran. Ended up returning it for a refund.
3,ok,graphics not the best. little disappointed....i guess ok for the price but could have been better...its collecting dust now. to bad.
3,Dwight's Bad Days,"After suffering through the""most painful experience"" of his life in completing this film, Dwight Yoakam also suffered horrible reviews for it. Maybe he tried to accomplish too much for his first directorial outing, in that he also wrote, scored, and starred in it, but really, it isn't that bad. I'm not a movie critic, I only know that this movie's story line and execution entertain me.(Other than the late Michael Jeter, who was a memorable actor, but at a certain decibel level, his voice makes me want to bite someone). Being a HUGE Dwight fan, I may be biased,but I think this movie's worth a look."
5,Awesome!,"My husband and I think this is one of Dwight's best! Although we like everything he does, some songs are better than others. Shows another aspect of Dwight's talents; love the movie clips in between songs!"
1,Too many errors!,"I teach graduate level research courses and reviewed this book for the publisher. There are so many errors in this book that I cannot even begin to list them. I could not in all practicality use this book with my students because of the multiple theoretical and conceptual errors. Another reviewer suggested graduate students get the book because it is helpful. As a professor I would not agree. There are many other texts that do a much better job discussing Action Research that are more practical, precise, make relevant connections to practice, and offer theoretical and conceptual accuracies."
5,You can't go wrong!!,"I was VERY leary about ordering this very item expensive item over the internet. After 17 years our old, identical Hayward Pump finally bit the dust. I looked in our local big chain pool stores and was told that this exact same item would cost me $500.00!! That's when I decided to buy this from Amazon for $287.80! TOTAL! FREE SHIPPING! It arrived within a week and after only 5 minutes and having to connect two wires it was up and running!! Save yourself some money, buy from Amazon!"
2,Quality of Newer Motors is Questionable,"My first Hayward SP2607X10 1hp Super Pump lasted 10 years, my second pump lasted 8 years, my third pump just failed and lasted 4 years and I am in the process of selecting a fourth pump. Each failure has been the motor but I replaced the complete pump assembly. Can anyone recommend a more reliable, longer lasting pump motor? Has the current motor been improved from the previous model or is it the same?"
5,Pool pump and motor,Best price compared to buying it local and installed. i saved almost $700.00 by ordering and having my soon install. Very easy to install...........like a garbage disposal.
5,Pumps good,I received the pump quickly and installed it with no problem and now have a crystal clear swimming pool-Thanks!
5,A Highly Entertaining Read!!!,"Though childless, I found Dr. Joseph Michelli's book ""Humor, Play & Laughter"" a highly entertaining read. I was particulary impressed with the ""Activities"" sections, which lacked the boring exercises found in other such books, replacing them with humor and joy. Dr. Michelli possess a fantastic sense of humor and fun - and nowhere does this stand out more than in the Chapters themselves. His treatment and respect for children as little people was very moving. The book kept me rolling. A reading MUST for caring parents, and those working with children."
2,"All the 7 Editors, please.","Please proofread carefully and don't fall intothe ""social loafing"" or ""diffusion of responsibility.""I find some questions are not reallycarefully constructed. And the answers are either too easyor too difficult to recognize.As a student, I find the text is a good summary compared to other test prep books. I'm sure you can do a better job."
4,Good book,"The book is good and gives you a general view of quantum information and computation. However, the size of the book disencourages beginners to read it."
3,Just too much brutality!,"This movie is the prove, that a lot of blood-splatter and brutality is just not enough to make a good movie.I am generally a fan of ""westerns"" about Australia, but this one is without very interesting story, not very good actors ( I have seen much better movies by Guy Pearce), no suspense.I wouldn`t watch it again.The 3 stars are only for nice landscapes of Australia and Guy Pearce."
3,Had it's moments but hard to stay awake at times,"I really wanted The Proposition to be good. It had an excellent cast including the almost always reliable Ray Winstone and the excellent Guy Pearce. However, this film was not as good as I had thought it would be. Sure, it conveys the savagery and the grime of the Australian outback in the 18th century but the story plodded along and the climax of the film was quite disappointing.With such an array of good actors and material, it could have been so much better. The story was written by Nick Cave, the Australian ""singer"" and dark lord of grumpy indie murder ballads. Sure , it had plenty of violence and pessimism about it but it was gore for the sake of gore and the film ended unsatisfactorily."
4,Guilty all,"Beautifully photographed, well acted with a heavy dose of Peckinpah. What's not to like. You know Christmas is not going according to plan."
3,"Handsome, but expensive","This is a beautiful corkscrew that lacks the all-importanttwo stage levering device that makes it easy for anyone toremove a cork. I own a Laguiole corkscrew. It hangs on thekitchen wall to be admired.I pull corks withPedrini Wine & Bar Pocket Waiter's Corkscrew Soft Grip.For more on the ways of wine, check out New Short Course in Wine,The"
3,sourdoughJ,"The cases are fragile and do not ship very well. About 6 of the 50 cases were damaged even though they were packaged adequately. Shipment arrived in a short time and other than the damage, the cases are fine."
4,Good live album from the biggest name in Madagascar,"In Madagascar, Dama Mahaleo is said to be the equivalent of Bob Dylan and the Beatles rolled into one. He is also an expert in finger-picked guitar, in the manner of Merle Travis. This is a French recording of a live concert by his band, Mahaleo. The band has several vocalists; the instrumentation is mostly guitar, with an occasional song on kabosy (a small Malagasy guitar with a mandolin-like sound). The songs ""Ramiaramila"" and closer ""Tongava Re"" alone are worth the price of the album. This rendition of ""Tongava Re"" is much better than the one on the Dama & D'Gary ""The Long Way Home"" CD. The songs ""Sambo de Gera"" and ""Ambahikily"" are also highlights. Mahaleo is not a dance band, like Tarika or Jaojoby. The music is more subdued; in fact, a sequence of three ballads in a row near the end makes the pacing a little strange for a live album."
2,excellent expensive writing,"Lamy tripen delivers an excellent quality writing but at a high price. It is too expensive for daily use. Unfortunately, once you get used to the comfort and practicality of having pen, mechanical pencil and marker in one piece, you are trapped with the refill.If you are considering the tripen for sporadic use, it is a great choice, but if you intend to use it on a daily basis, like me in college, prepare to be a regular."
4,Another briiliant piece of Mangold investigation,"Even if you have no interest in the world of biological warfare, Mangold's deep and thorough investigative technique surfaces again. This book details the biological warfare efforts of a range of countries, such as Japan, Russia, South Africa and Iraq, as well as the Aum Shinrikyo cult and their sarin (albeit a chemical agent) attack on the Tokyo subway. Not advisable to read in conjunction with or shortly after Alibek's ""Biohazard,"" as a large portion is devoted to the Russian weapons programme-meaning you'll skim through maybe 150 pages (but read them both anyway). I found the strong points of this book lay in its investigation and interviews of countries that would normally be difficult to research, such as South Africa. Low points-it does require a fairly concerted effort and can become a little dense at times, as well as needing fairly constant revision on Iraq and South Africa."
5,Good Book.,Really good book. We used this book as one of our class. And really helpful to know about Bioterrorism and Biodefense.
3,"Great ""Hammer"" but disappointing dinos","I picked up this set for the colorful dinosaurs. On the box they appear dynamic and interesting, but the actual toys remind me more of 70s-era action figures with no articulation. The dinos flex a little and have nice paint detail, but don't get your hopes up.The ""Hammer"", on the other hand, turns out to be a great car! I threw it together after my initial disappointment with the dinos, and when I was done it really blew me away. Even my wife was very impressed by how well it captures a certain blocky SUV popularized by our Austrian governator."
3,Missing Trax,"This could have been a much better CD with the inclusion of ""Dynamo Dance"", ""Major Man Theme"" and especially ""Love Makes The World Go Round"". I can't even imagine why ""Love Makes The World Go Round"" wouldn't be included. Oh well, I guess we'll just have to wait for volume two."
5,c&k,Love it! Greatest Hawaiian music I have ever heard. Every time I listen to c&k all my emotions change and I feel so relaxed and happy!
1,Crud,For a game like Zelda when it comes to precise handling it just fell apart. For a game like Mario Party where you don't care if the controller falls apart then this would be good.
4,"Works just fine, seems like a lot of money for a few small parts","I use this for the response trigger and cyclone feeder on my 98 custom. Without it, you can use only one of the two upgrades. Seems like a lot of money, but it works. It is a little strange the way it runs along the outside of the marker, seems like you could break it if you bump into something, but I haven't had any problems."
4,An essential trainer,Lisa Densmore's book has proven to be a especially good buy as it illuminates the core of modern high performance skiing. A close reading yielded real benefits. The advice on preparation for a season's activity has also proven most beneficial. The clarity and authority of the writing invites reading this well presented book time and again.
2,Nothing to Declare has Little to Offer,"After a freak lightning storm, George Putter, played by Billy Zane, is the only Putter left in Putterton. To replace one of George's uncles as the taxman, a beautiful tax inspector, Caroline DeVille (Valerie Valois) shows up in this cold Canadian town. She soon discovers that no one, including George, has paid taxes in 50 years, and she brings in a bus load of auditors, which sends the townpeople into a panic.The premise is full of potential, but I found the characters one-sided and flat, and the love story undeveloped and unbelievable.If you like Billy Zane and quirky characters, you will enjoy this movie. If you're looking for a light, romantic comedy--the kind that you want to revisit over and over, keep looking. Putterton may not be worth visiting more than once."
2,Slow but cute,It was a kind of cute story. I enjoyed the movie but I'd only recommend it if you don't have anything else to watch.
3,"To LAWNBOY: Mike Clark ""The Original Funky Drummer?""","Excuse me, but the true ""Original Funky Drummer"" title goes to Jabo Starks, JB's drummer.Mike's good, (even great with Herbie) but Jabo is THE MAN!"
5,"totally different for Nora, but excellent in it's own way...","While Promise Me Tommorow is a departure from her norm, but still a wonderfully well written book. I wouldn't have missed it for the world, and for those of you who get the chance, grab this baby! Nora swears she won't let it be reprinted, so if ever you see this book, snatch it right up!!"
2,"Sounds like a vinyl ""needledrop"" mastering to me","I'm pretty disappointed in this 2012 Rock Candy re-issue/remaster.To me it sounds like it came off an LP - I can hear what sounds like vinyl surface noise in spots.God only knows what was actually used as the source tapes for this - unlike other remasters I've picked up in the last couple of years, this one makes no mention of a good starting place like ""the original master tapes""; it simply doesn't make mention of the source at all (not a good sign).So after listening to this I will assume it is from an LP, or some kind of multi-gen copy that has been no-noised and had artifacts added. I guess they did not have access to something with better sound (?).The booklet is nice though."
1,"Wow, sooo bad...","This has got to be one of the worst movies ever. You can read on Eric Roberts (bro of Julia) face that he hates it as much as you will after just a few minutes. I couldn't finish this... It looks cheap, cheap, cheap.... Don't expect quality movie making."
5,gamer since 1988,Do not listen to other people who have review this item and gave it one star. They are probable little kids who are under 18 and don't know how to play a game with challenge. That is what good about this game it has old-school challenge and that is important and very hard for me to find in a game. The villians are cool the story is somewhat the same as the N64 version but a little different.
1,THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE WORST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED,"This game is wack the graphics are a 2 out of 10. The sound is choppy. The gameplay is too easy. I beat this game in three days. If you are a spider-man fan like me get this game on playstation NOT gbc. This game is nothing like the playstation or n64 one. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON GAME BOY COLOR BUY IT ON PLAYSTATION OR N64. EVERYTHING ON THE PS, AND N64 ARE TOTALLY BETTER!"
4,It's about time for this book!,"You go into the video store and there's always something new totry -- some new star or offbeat director or something totally unfamiliar, like the Hong Kong action movies -- they're really wild!But you go into the bookstores, looking to read up on your new interests, and you usually walk out without buying anything. But this book about Jet Li intrigued me and I started skimming some of the synopses...and I was hooked. So now I'm going to rent more Hong Kong action movies, and keep this Jet Li book nearby to help me appreciate them. Thanks, guys."
4,Solid Bio of the Last Great Martial Arts Star,"A solid biography of Li up to the year 2002. (""The Shaolin Temple"" to ""The One"")It is the best bio on Li written so far...it is probably the only one so far.Author James Robert Parish chronicles the ups and downs of Li's personal life and film career, giving plot synopsis and a behind the scenes looks at how the film projects came about and were recieved by the public. The book is an easy read and provides an interesting look at Li's life and film career from his youth in Beijing to his big break in Hollywood. Bios written about people who are still active become dated quickly. This book will just have to do for another 15 years or so when, hopefuly, more detailed and complete bios can be written about Li's life.Recommended for huge Jet Li fans and huge fans of the kung fu film genre."
4,I'm Enjoying It,"I bought this for my grandfather when he was confined to a hospital bed. Unfortunately, he never got well enough to listen to it, but my husband and I listened to it on a road trip, and we really enjoyed it. I know that my grandfather would have gotten quite a kick out of it if he were still alive!"
3,Too long and slow moving,"When I started this very long book, I didn't know if I would bother to finish it. I'm glad I did, but it doesn't live up to the writing in the ""War and Remembrance"" series. The fictional characters are well written, but I looked forwward to the segments that actually contained any military action. There just wasn't enough action."
5,Two Handed Gem,"Not too many solo piano recordings get back onto my player with the frequency of this gem from Fred Hersch. Recorded in 2003 at the famous Bimhuis in Amsterdam, Hersch completely dazzles the audience with his creative spirit and amazing dexterity. The acoustics are perfect for the warm toned piano player who has delivered a steady flow of excellent recordings over a long period of time. The program is a mix of standards such as ""The Nearness of You"" & ""Don't Blame Me"" with three satisfying Hersch originals. His take on Monk's ""Evidence"" is a lesson in singular interpretation with some wonderful surprises along the way.For myself, I have always been a sucker for Jimmy Rowles ""The Peacocks"" and have many versions in my collection. This solo performance is one of the finest.No hesitation in awarding this album the full five starsIn Amsterdam: Live at the Bimhuis"
4,The Lazy Exerciser,This video is easy to follow but some technique by one person in video is incorrect. This video gets my blood going but is definitely not aerobic. I have had this video for over 5 years and I still like it.
5,more than five stars,"I'd worry about peope who don't hurt themselves laughing while reading Wapiti School. My goodness, these stories are terrific, sometimes tough and bitter, sometimes perfect poetry. Just wonderful."
4,where rivers change direction,"great book, as a mother, it gave me another view of boyhood to manhood. Written very well"
5,"A trip ""home""","I loved this book. It was like a trip home for me...I grew up in the same locale and a very similar time period as the author - I found myself happily recalling people and places named in the book. Journeys back to our childhood - our formative years - are always frought with pitfalls. Were the places ever that wonderful? Were the people ever that horrible? But Spragg avoided those pitfalls well in his written recollections and painted very strong and beautiful pictures of life up Northfork - the good, the bad, the harsh, the beautiful. I have never been as homesick as I was when I finished this book. I can't wait to read his other books!"
2,The devil is in the details in historical romances,"This was a hard book to get into. The pace was fast and furious but the devil is in the details. A plot cannot stand by itself but must have context. A 12-going-on-13-year-old boy in 1867 was almost an adult and Casey would be considered a woman grown - many girls were married at 15 and mothers by 16. And a ""tall"" Comanche would have been 5'7"". If you want a tall Native American in the Plains states, you have to go to Pawnee or Osage. So I gave this book 2 stars. Less picky readers would rate it higher based on the innocent steamy sensuousness."
1,"Disappointingly, surprisingly bad","The best that can be said for this book is that there are a lot of interesting ideas in it. Or, rather, there are gestures toward a lot of interesting ideas; there is absolutely no follow-through. One gets the sense of an author with attention deficit disorder: He sat down to his typewriter every day and wrote down the great new idea he had, but never got back to doing anything with the previous day's ideas.The result is an incoherent book, in which the plot developments seem to just happen, the characters--such as there are any; we really get to know only one--are never developed, and there are several glaring holes in the world-building that are never addressed. By the end, I simply didn't care what happened. I'm not opposed to science fiction that focuses on the ideas at the expense of extensive character development, but for that to work you actually have to, well, focus on the ideas."
3,Sarah Gelushia,I was happy with the order I had purchased with the company. I love this perfume it is amazing. Not to excited that they have discontinue this product.
1,still has a long way to go,"i had high hopes for this second album from davis. but blame it on me for buying it, this album disappoints. the success of her first album seems largely driven by her reliance on solid covers, which frankly, with the right backup and studio, many could sing to great acclaim. other reviewers have asked why alana ""hasn't blown up already"". well, i have a hunch those are her friends writing in, plugging the album. there is some raw talent present here, but ms. davis has a long way to go before earning her place in the ranks of the truly successful performing artists out there."
4,Decent,"Overall, it's pretty great, not great though. There are more current books that will be of more help. However, if you want multiple perspectives, this one is great for that!"
1,What's the difference between this....,"...DVD set and an Saturday afternoon on The Sci-Fi Channel?The Sci-Fi Channel comes free with your cable subscription.If you enjoy the kind of movies Sci-Fi shows, go for it.Otherwise, you have or will see these on there soon so save your money."
1,floaty without depth,"I was really looking forward to a chakra meditation, I have used them before on workshops and found them very good for foccussing. This album however is very flouncy and my stillness of mind was interrupted on more than one occasion by the high child-like tones of the instrumentation. I dont believe my chakras resonate at such high pitches and I could not relax to it whatsoever, it sounds like something a baby might enjoy. After reading so many good reviews of this album my expectations were set and I was disappointed."
1,meditation music,I didnt like this one to much. it was so computer synthasised and it screamed new age. I cant listen to this and meditate in peace. the pitches are to high and it desturbed my mind rather than being in the background. good if you like new age music. bad if you want to meditate with it. I chucked this one in the bin.
4,Relaxing morning music,I play Chakra Suite each morning after my meditation while I am having breakfast and find it an excellent way to prepare for the day.
5,I wouldn't have believed it!,"I know nothing about chakras, and I'm very new to this relaxation style of music. But I can honestly say when I played this softly on my iPod whilst lying down on my tummy, I suddenly developed goose bumps. As I lay, I'm not sure if it was the beat or the notes of the music, but I felt the music move up and down my back as if someone was softly drumming it like a zylophone. It was pure heaven. I would never have believed this had I not experienced it for myself.I know music can bring about strong emotions, but Steven Halpern is expert in more than that, through his music he alters your feeling and mood to one of peace, serenity and calm that stays with you long after the music ends. I would not only recommend this, I would advocate that most people NEED this in our frantic and chaotic world - if only to take a breather for a few moments in time.After absorbing this inspirational music, I think my Chakras are now well and truly aligned!!"
5,GREAT!,I enjoyed the CD very much! It was very relaxing. I even played it for my young daughter before going to bed.
5,Spectrum Suite revisited?,"I was looking for Spectrum Suite, a favorite from 30 years ago. I didn't find it so I downloaded Chakra Suite instead. I'm happy to say I can't tell thee difference between the two. I love it as much as ever as do my friends who are hearing it for the first time. I highly recommend it."
4,Best of Steven Halpern,Chakra Suite the reissue of Spectrum Suite is a wonderful album.One of the most popular New Age albums of all times. This CD is very good for energy healing and Chakra balancing. Also recommended for Chakra balancing and healing sessions isHealing Vibesby Paradiso.
4,Not a book for beginners...,"If you love Japanese food, this is the book for you. More then simply a list of recipes, it really does describe Japanese cooking as an art form. Unfortunately, if you are a newcomer to Japanese cooking as I myself am, the book is not particularly useful in the kitchen. First of all, the book sacrifices ease for authenticity. This means that many of the dishes require ingredients or tools that aren't readily available at the local supermarket. However, if you want to really learn how authentic Japanese food is prepared, look no further."
4,What a Wonderful Book!,"Interesting, Beautiful to look at, Can't wait to start trying ""new"" things...Thanks"
5,Best Japanese Cookbook,My wife and I bought this cookbook in Japan 25 years ago and have used it often since then. It is the best I've found on describing ingredients and how to do certain techniques especially making sushi rice.
5,bookshelf must,"i can't even begin to explain how excellent this book really is...it is an essential to every international cookbook shelf...mr. tsuji defines japanese food in clear and understandable terminology allowing the reader, in a sense, to get a visual and palatial (maybe not a word, but forgive me) feel of this very intricately simple cuisine...and yes, i too read it front to cover(how many times can you say that about a cookbook)...mr Tsuji is to japanese cuisine what escoffier is to the french, only more comprehensible, even to the western mindset..."
4,Not Really so Simple,"A beautiful book, clearly written, but the simple of the title is misleading. These are difficult, exacting recipes calling for both ingredients and kitchenware that require a search in specialty Japanese markets."
5,If your serious,If you want to get the spirit of Japanese cooking then this is the best place to start (aside from visiting Japan itself). I used to go to my local Japanese store and I didn't understand all those different products. After studying this work I now have good beginers know how. This book is much more than a cookbook.
2,disappointment,"this book is a very good japanese cooking book,but.... I expected a totally different book,when I ordered.It has only two pages with pictures!The rest is text.But on the amazon side -inside the book - there is a book with a lot of interesting photos.So,that why I`m soooo disappointed.But I cannot send back,the costs are to high for this."
5,An amazing piece of music...,"Well, good luck trying to come up with words to discribe this genre - post industrial slacker experimental acid jazz? I won't bother trying to describe it except to say it is pure listening pleasure to hear the latest from this guy. Four Tet's earlier little gem barely lays the groundwork for this cd and that says a lot about the earlier cd.Lots of different themes and styles are in evidence here with a wide range of instruments and electronica thrown in. No tracks are jarringly different and yet none are quite variations. Considering he is a guitarist, it would appear he also is quite talented with piano, keyboards, percussion and sampling. The only thing better than listening to the cd is the fact that he's playing here next month..."
1,Don't buy these!,These are not real uggs. I ordered them in chestnut color and the color is totally off the original uggs. also the inside fur comes out when you put your feet in. I have a pair of REAL UGGS and these are nothing like them. Beware and don't waste your time buying these!!!
2,Probably the worst book on Post-Socialism I have ever read.,"Poorly outlined. Theory is used intermittently and poorly explained. Very boring book too. It doesn't really contribute much to discussions on the Soviet Union or Post-Socialism. Excellent book layout and graphic design, but terrible content. Avoid unless you want to be bored."
5,Great Charlie Daniels,"HIGH LONESOME is a great Charlie Daniels album. It has several great songs. If you like his later work (e.g. MILLION MILE REFLECTIONS) or FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN, you'll like HIGH LONESOME."
5,I love Mary Balogh,"I found this by sheer luck at a UBS. I'd read the sequel (Silent Melody) years ago and loved it. This is one of MB's best books IMO. It's just so solid and engaging that I almost don't know how to desribe it except to say I never wanted to put it down and I thought about the characters when I wasn't reading it (always a good sign and it happens seldom with me). The evolution of the characters (esp Luke,OMG) was fascinating to observe and when they named their daughter (he was hoping for a girl), I got a little misty eyed. He can wear all the lace he wants, actions speak louder than red heels and Luke is pretty dang manly to me,LOL."
3,3 stars,"Reading this book was a battle between interesting and boring. It just went too slowly for me but it's a good book.I like the dandy thing but sticking a fan in a guy's hand doesn't make him a dandy, it just makes it REALLY funny."
4,Si Begg - Director's Cut,"Si Begg continues his worldwide electronic funk assault, this time under his own name. With Director's Cut, he shoots straight for the dancefloor and hits a bull's-eye with all targets down. The majority of the tracks are bleepy and groovy in a way that would make Herbie Hancock proud, but ""Grind"" almost manages to have an organic feel to it. Begg also invites vocalists for this project and not just lame MCs, either. There's a definite dearth of good female MCs, but Miss MC on ""Buss"" does an outstanding job of getting booties shaking. The three MCs on ""Moveup"" aren't quite as exciting, but they do the job. The tracks towards the end of the album lose a bit of steam, but most will still get the floor moving. You just can't stop the funk."
2,Not a Blue spec disc as stated,"I'm a fan of Lee Ritenour and was delighted when I came across this and it being advertised as recorded in Blue Spec would be Wow! anticipated a high quality remaster. But, when I received it, it was not a Blue Spec disc but an ordinary CD. Fortunately it was still a well recorded disc. NOT AS STATED IN AMAZON."
5,You must give this CD a chance.,"I was first intoduced to Ednaswap when they opened up for Better Than Ezra in NYC, and I've been a fan since then. Wacko Magneto was a demonstration of how intense their music can be, but Wonderland Park shows off their songwriting skills, versitility, and talent in making great music. It's rare that you can find a band that writes songs that are catchy at the first listen, but keep getting better as you listen to them more. ""Supernatural"" ""747"" and ""Back on the Sun"" are definitely memorable."
1,NO GOOD,"These things are junk. I tried both ways, with the battery power, and with the usb power and they distort at the lowest audible volume. Don't waste you money and time in packaging them up to send back!"
5,LES PAUL IS GOD (in earthly form),"Ever so briefly. I do not know if or when Les Paul has ever been accorded with a more deserving or similar accolade than the tele-documentary ""Les Paul: Chasing Sound."" I just saw the show on PBS/OBP (Oregon's Public Broadcasting ""affiliate"" if you will - this state may be lovely, but do they have to ""pretend"" they invented or own the concept of Public Broadcasting? - I THINK NOT!).Les Paul IS, without any question, the Greatest Musical Creator. And not just (an obviously bleached out blonde) Richard Carpenter, but anyone who claims to love or have a clue about guitars, music, harmonics, arrangements should be in his (as well as Mary Ford)'s debt.In this age of techno-this & automated-that, nothing will ever compare with his (or their) unsung contributions! LONG LIVE LES PAUL! And Mary Ford!"
5,Best 90 minutes you'll ever spend looking at a TV screen,"If the Les Paul story does not awe you, you are not human. A guitar talent without peer, and a garage inventor with an Edison-like genius. He couldn't find the sound he wanted with existing instruments, so he invented technology that got him there. Electronic pickups, overdubbing, multi-track recording, and techniques that influence every pop record made to this day."
4,Very nice sounds,"I was impressed with over half of the songs the very first time hearing them, and the others grew on me very soon after. The remake of Sundown is the best by far, with 45 and Redwagon following. This CD is a must."
2,Lurid book jacket leaves you hoping for more,"BURNING GIRL opens with a fast-paced and illuminating characterization of the main character. Neihart relied heavily on dialogue here, and he was definitely ""trying too hard."" Gen X cool should be anything but contrived, and that was not the case here. Furthermore, the attempt at suspense unravels and becomes a trite ""only the truth will set you free"" Aesop Fable..... Was hoping for more."
3,I really wanted to like this book.,"Perhaps I ""just didn't get it."" But having finished this in only two sittings (on coast-to-coast plane rides), I honestly didn't care for any of the characters -- least of all the narrator, and in the end, just wanted the whole affair (and book) over with. The premise was plausible enough and (dare I say) deftly set up. Midway through, however, the characterisations grew tiresome. Although not entirely a waste of my time, this ""Burning Girl"" ultimately left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
4,He goes solo and keeps it real...,"Wow, wasn't expecting a whole lot after he left Tribe. I thought this man would sell out like the rest of them or not learn how to survive on his own. But while I'd prefer ATCQ to this, this is a solid album filled with skilled rhyming, intelligent rap viewpoints, and hip beats.Q-Tip is insanely jealous, I bet."
4,i liked this album,"Phife kept it street and underground on this album. My favorite songs are Flawless(i think he dissed QTip on this song), Miscellanous, Bend Over, Ventilation. I like some more songs on the album but i can't remember the song titles. What happened to his other solo album Songs In The Key Of Phife which was supposed to come out 3 years ago? I wish he would do more solo albums. Phife is one of my favorite mc's. I always liked him more than QTip."
4,Better Than Expected,"I am not a fan of Tribe, but Phife has always been the most lyrical of the group. He proves it on this album. His lyrics are tight and unlike Q-Tip, he sticks to what the ATCQ fans liked him for. He even steps it up a notch. A definite must because it will satisfy those who are craving for lyrical content that is quality."
2,Joke book,"This is a book of 22 different riddles or jokes. Many of them aren't very good, like the joke that goes: ""When do elephants have sixteen feet? When there are four elephants."" The pictures however are really cute, and portray many of our favorite and well-known Disney characters. Besides Goofy, there is Jiminy Cricket, Prince John, Dumbo, Pinocchio, Mickey and more of our friends are in here. The book is arranged so that almost each page has a riddle, and the answer to the previous riddle with a picture to match. This book doesn't have a story line, and after reading it several times it could get really old as once you know the answer to the riddles you wouldn't even have that incentive to continue reading.Loggie-log-log-log"
3,"Strange, uneven relic: just focus on Jeff","At the time of this release, live Jeff Beck on vinyl was hard to find. (In fact, it's only been very recently that live Jeff Beck has been readily available.) A Beck/Hammer live album was widely anticipated, in the wake of a string of outstanding concerts. What wound up on the album, however, was not uniformly great, and it's hard to fathom the decisions that were made. With the exception of ""Freeway Jam"" and ""Blue Wind"", two absolutely thunderous moments from Jeff, the album was full of unusually ""noodly"" Jan Hammer, some genuinely tacky, bad songs by Hammer's group (and very bad vocals). Not enough Jeff, too much Hammer group. This is worth having in any Jeff Beck collection, but unfortunately fails to capture the best of their live 1970s collaborations (does Epic still have some old tracks?) Beck and Hammer have consistently given us great moments-- in studio--- those are the tracks worth looking for."
4,Eggcellent!,"This is an album worth buying. Being a 42 year old Fusion Fanatic, I'm extremely picky about what I listen to. I have a mature, well-round ""musical taste-bud"" and let me tell you, if you're looking for excellent Jazz Rock Fusion guitar work that's smoothly integrated with snazzy, smooth, and highly listenable keyboards, this is the album you have to buy!"
5,One of the greatest live albums ever,"This disc is right up there with Kiss alive, Framptom comes alive, or Cheap Trick at budokan. I remember the first time I heard this I was absolutely blown away. Been a fan of Jeff Beck for a while, and always liked live albums, and this one is definitely worth checking out. I've seen Jeff live a few times, and this album demonstrates the absolute guitar god that he is. Do not pass this one up."
2,"Clever playing, but ......","Both the front two musician play some clever an interesting stuff, guitar sound good, playing generally very good, keboards yes again very cleverly played, a littl forward in the mix maybe, but some inbalance is to be expected on a live record, but never does it seem to me that a group is playing the music, there is now synergy, just cleverness for cleverness' sake. I listen to it occassionally for Freeway Jam. The nearest it gets to tight ensemble playing. As for the singing to quote a little from a vocoder monstrosity ""put your hands together""..... over you ears. One good track, but you can ignore the rest. Pity really as the whole band can play music."
1,TERRIBLE after 1 year,"We bought a total of 4 of these. 2 for the motorcycles, and 2 for the fishing boat. They worked great for one year. However all 4 failed within 18 months. First one on the boat went bad. Then one on the motorcycle. Then the other on the motorcycle. Then the last one on the boat was removed. But failed shortly after installed on another motorcycle. TERRIBLE. Worse part is they were purchased through Wal-mart who stopped carrying the brand not too longer after we purchased the chargers and we lost the receipt. $100 bucks down the drain.The failed in one or two ways. 1) They lights would flash back and forth but the batteries were perfectly fine and STILL using them years after with no problems. 2) They would just all of a sudden die, no lights, nothing. Just a slight buzz inside the case that you'd normally hear."
1,FAILED...10 months,"Got mine as a gift from a neighbor. I used it intermittently to charge my 2 motorcycles. Last week I hoohed it up, there was a hissing sound and smoke. I pulled the power plug out immediately. It's fried."
4,Creatures 2 = GREAT!!!!,"I tried this at a friend's house and ordered mine from eBay (sorry Amazon, but THEY ship to Canada!) and it's a GREAT game! The norns are kind of hard to train (""freddy hungry, run grendel""... what?!?!) It's hard to make them eat, sleep, get away from the grendels, not drown... but it's a challenge. Also if you have little kids they should try Creatures Adventures. It's creatures for young children and it's also cute although I never tried it. This game is pretty old so it is at bargain prices now. Have fun! :-)"
2,Never cared for string arrangements in jazz tunes,"There's some ok tunes on this. But it's a bit jazz ""lite"" for my taste. You Better Go Now, Stay With Me and Stardust were all way, way too ""jazz lite"" for my personal taste. To each their own -- and I've just told you mine."
4,Some skipping on one song,"Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. CD skips at the end of one song slightly, but that's just the risk of buying used I guess. It was cheaper than buying a new one or downloading the songs on iTunes, and the delivery was really fast."
3,Could have used more Freshness...,"ICP is great, but alot of this stuff you saw on the first Forgotten Freshness. It would have been better of them to include alot of the things that I know they have but didn't release. Stay down with the clown til your dead in the ground!"
5,Matches trim of antique bookcase,"I'm making an entertainment hutch for my parents, and need to match the trim on an antique mahogany bookcase they have. This did the job perfectly. No burning or tear-outs."
3,World Coins Book,"Nice book, some typos but other than that good. I would have felt better about the purchase if the price tag marked on the book had not been about $6 less than what I had paid. When sending the product out, you might want to remove the price tag so your customer's don't feel like they got ripped off..."
1,Not worth the money!,Telescope arrived with both mirrors bouncing around loose in the telescope because the glue that once held them in place gave way. I glued them both back on!The electronic audio starfinder is barely audible and useless.Objects do not appear much larger through the lenses than they do without the telescope.I should have spent more money on something worthwhile.
3,Full Catastrophe Living,"The book is very detailed regarding how one stress clinic helps their clients. The author has some very good points, but is long winded."
5,many thank's,"I recommend it - I liked it veru much, its really amazing !its going to help me, I am sure !"
4,Helping Yourself,A very good book - full of interesting ideas and real life examples. The companion tapes work well with the book. The only drawback for me is that the book is very wordy - I have read it in full but really had to push myself to do so. Now I just skip around to the parts I want to reread.
5,If You Buy Only One Book This Year...,"In my opinion this is the best approach I've seen to meditating. It is done from a secular standpoint (although each person has the freedom to add whatever spiritual dimension they wish to their own practice) and easy to follow and understand. Another thing I like about this book is the flexibility to read, go back, go forward, go back again, etc. I am very impressed with this approach to stress reduction. I owe Mr. Kabat-Zinn a debt of gratitude for writing this book and making his stress reduction program accessible to everyone who wants it."
2,I have read better books,I just think that there are better books about the haunts in Charleston. Look them up. This is o.k. if you want the history of the building more than the ghost that is in it.
2,Fixer upper,I got this a few years ago. It seems to reduce the number of mosquitos. Problem is that I've had to take it apart several times to get it working again. OK one time a gekko died in the fan so that was an easy fix. But it has problems constantly and I think has died after 2 seasons (it wont stay lit).Maybe try another model or manufacturer.
4,"Cool Game, it could be better","i don't own this game, but i play it at my friend's house all the time. I do own Catz 2, and 3 is a lot better.in 3, you can go to different rooms, Have different foods, Play with lots of more toyz, have tons of different breedz, change the color of the paint can, and let them put on clothez and accessoriez. You can even breed them! in catz 2 you can't do any of that stuff. the only complaints i've heard were from people who uploaded they're catz from 1 or 2, and say that they're catz used to be friendly and do tricks, but refuse to in 3. otherwise this is a great game!"
2,Sounds fun......but it's not really,"I purchased this game after reading raving reviews about it...and I must say I was THOUROUGHLY dissapointed. I was bored with the game after a half an hour of playing it. There's really not that much you can actually do in the game. Your catz just wander around a setting looking cute and fighting with the other catz. You can dress up the pets with a few outfits or try to play with them; they don't usually want to play with the toys. I did not have any luck with my cats having babies like I wanted them to, and it was very hard to train them. All in all, this game is NOT worth the money. If you really desire a virtual thing on your computer, buy the game Babyz instead."
5,Stringing the centuries together,"This is a delightful program of music, from Italian Renaissance to George Gershwin, played on modern constructions of historical instruments--archlute, baroque guitar, 19th century guitar and modern. I don't listen to classical guitar that often (the obvious ones, Bream, Segovia), usually going in for popular stuff (Crary, Legg), but Willard gave a splendid concert at a New York art museum earlier this summer and I picked this up as a memento. It is still a pleasure to listen to--elegant, clear playing by a experienced and talented artist."
5,Get Ready To Be Blown Away,"I heard ""Out On A Limb"" on the radio, the only time I've ever heard Mary Ann Redmond played, and I had to have the CD, if only for that song. What I heard when I listened to this album for the first time is every music lover's dream. Her version of the old Supremes standard, ""Stop In the Name of Love"" literally made me cry, it made my heart ache so. But the real killer is the title song, ""Here I Am"". This is the one that grabs you and throws you down and doesn't let go. An astonishing, totally unique voice that comes straight from the soul. An EXTRAORDINARY album."
5,Diamond in the Rough,"Mary Ann amazes me not only with her vocal range, but even more so, with her stylings. From soul to blues to funk, Mary Ann captures emotions with her voice, her words, and her music. Washington, DC is truly blessed to have this relative unknown play to astonished crowds at small venues.Why record labels have failed to see the talent in Mary Ann reinforces their obvious search for glitz over true musical talent. Had MTV existed in the 60's, we most likely would not have been graced with the songs of Janis Joplin or Aretha Franklin. Is the comparison hyperbole? HARDLY! Wake up and listen to the music!"
3,avengers,"A lot of reviews of this set were great, especially the episode that related to picture (Queen of Sin). I've been an Avengers fan since its original airings, & I've always found Miss Peel right attractive, but Queen of Sin is the worst episode I've looked at on DVD so far. Her outfit is not really that sexy, & the story to that episode was absolutely lousy (& loud). If you're buying individual sets & not the whole Emma Peel megaset, then skip this set; don't let the cover fool you. The rest of the episodes in this set are better however, so if you're making complete year purchases, then buy this set too....you decide."
2,Not the Original Formula No Sugar Version!,"Despite the box color and misleading labeling Muesli, don't be fooled as I was. This is not the same as the No Sugar version of the Original Formula with the muesli consistency that expands when soaked with milk or soymilk and which has the wonderful date pulp flavoring. This is a new hybrid muesli-flakes version that I have never seen for sale in stores especially created for American taste which is used to lots of flakes and raisins. Now I have to finish off six boxes before I can go back to Original Formula or No Sugar Original Formula."
1,Do not buy this product,"Do not buy this product if you expect Familia Original recipe. The product description claims that this is the original recipe in a newly designed package, but this is not the case.I had been buying Familia for years. Perhaps the formula is the same but the product I received was not the milled grain I expected. It was more like puffed wheat; think sugar puffs without the sugar.It was like eating cardboard.To their credit, Amazon gave me a refund."
1,Gut(t)erman Lives Up To His Name,"Son of the Mask amounts to an increasingly loud and torturous series of visual-effects duels, familiar territory for director Lawrence Guterman (aptly becoming known as Larry Gutterman), who made 2001s Cats & Dogs, another family movie shallowly built around us-against-them mayhem. A couple of the gross-out sight gags are so crude theyll provoke groans of disgust without a titter of laughter from young children the jokes are aimed at."
1,Son Of The Mask Review,Son of the mask looks absolutely horrible. The trailer has frightened and turned off people across the country. In fact the trailer was pulled by NewLine! Apparently son of the mask is about a baby that dumps in his diaper. The mask is contained there. The rest of the film is trying to recover the mask from the diaper. Parents keep your kids away! Word has it that this film is really some sort of sexual reference for god knows what.
1,Unbelievably bad,"This is one of those movies that you sit and watch in stunned amazment at just how incredibly bad it is. It is hard to pull yourself from it once you start viewing it since you are drawn to see if it somehow accidently has some redeeming piece only to be struck aghast as it takes another even more dramatic turn deeper into garbage.Junk, rotten, stinker, garbage... Try all the words you know and none, not even in every possible combination can convey just what a bad movie this is."
4,Good fun movie,"Most guys I know are reluctant to become fathers. This movie really plays on that well. karma, karma, karma. The baby takes the Dad to the cleaners basically and it's mayhem.I loved the special effects, how the baby becomes the mask baby and the dog too.But Loki takes the cake. he's a great actor. it's really entertaining and I don't know why people are so hard on it just because Jim Carrey's not in it from a thousand years ago when they did the first movie.Get over it."
1,"10 mins of excitement, 70 mins of horrible","In my opinion, the movie was dead-styled and hardly funny. The dog was probably the spotlight for me and I'll give Loki and Kal Penn some credit too, but all the other characters were absolutely horrible. The mother just practically abandoned the dad and son almost the whole way, and the dad was finally using his brain at the end of the movie. When the baby is not in CGI and is just a normal baby he's alright, but when he uses his powers he's one of the most ugliest things I ever saw. What the baby does is not even funny and his motive for abusing his father is just annoying pathetic."
1,Son of the Mask,"this movie was a total disaster. I mean I never saw it in theaters but I remember anticipating the film and then I remember how disappointing it was to see this garbage. would I own it: yes, but for a child tho."
1,Save your money and save your time.,"Honestly, I just came here to warn certain readers to skip this trash. Don't illusions of this movie becoming a Cult Classic. Nope, forget it won't happen. This will never be a cult classic."
3,Fair,"Although the book starts out with an interesting premise -- the political repression of Argentina paralleled by the emotional and sexual repression of a young Argentine -- it quickly devloves into a rather prosaic gay coming of age story. Midway through the novel all international intrigue is abruptly dropped, and the remainder is a hodge-podge of overwrought love seens. Could have been good, but instead it was only mildly interesting."
2,Disappointed persistence,"Even though I read the whole book, the main character's homosexuality did not interest me at all. I was hoping that it would be relevant to the story. I was thinking that Donald and his wife would try to use this feature of his character to achieve something through him for the US State Dept; but it turned out as far as I could determine that the American characters were not needed for the story. In other words, if there had been an aspect of intrigue in the story due to his homosexuality, I would have found it interesting and perhaps well written."
4,Great concert but poor recording.,"It's a shame this recording is of such poor quality because the band is really on. There is also a poor, very obvious cut in one of the first tracks...Green breaks into a solo where he wouldn't have. Just sloppy. Other than that the album is great. Peter is smoking as per his usual and the rest of the band is right on, but I really hate to crank this album because of the poor sound quality. Oh well...it still gets 4 stars in spite of it."
5,Best Borodin 2,"This is a fabulous album. The sound quality is excellent, and this is the best version of Borodin's Symphony 2 I've heard. The pacing seems perfect to me--much better than Martinon's, though that's fun to listen to as well. The Balakirev and Khachaturian are great too."
1,Unfortunately a Dim Bulb,I tried this in my 98 Ninja ZX-6 and unfortunately the bulb generates far less light than the regular incandescent bulbs that came with the bike. So much dimmer in fact I felt it would be unsafe to use these bulbs. I sent them back for a refund.
4,Better than the sequel to Blair Witch!,"Has some of the same set ups as the first Bare Wench but the cast is gorgeous! Returning Bare Wencher, Nicki Fritz returns as her own twin sister. She's joined by Alexus Winston and Juliet Cariaga among others. Julie Strain reprises her role as the lust inducing Bare Wench. Much nudity ensues. If you liked the original or ""Survivors Exposed"" (which also stars Alexus Winston), then you should like this sequel!"
5,Unlikely yet beautiful meeting of cultures,"The concept of a meeting of Norwegian and African musicians sounds unlikely on paper. Surprise, surprise! This CD is beautiful and entirely unique! Kirsten Braten Berg has one of the most lovely, pure voices on the planet and boy does it sound good framed by the superb kora and African percussion provided by her collaborators. Stands right up there with the Buena Vista Social Club as a charming, fun beautiful listening experience that proves that music really is the universal language."
4,Last Call for Camelot,"This is the final time we see Modred in the series. Too bad, for being a ""bad guy"" I liked him. But then again, I'd never want to meet him in my life doing his ""profession"". The new detective will be interesting to see how well he interfaces with the rest of the group and I can't wait till he get's in an arguement with Broom. That will be the funniest thing to see in a long time in this series."
3,"Good, but not great","This is certainly a a good CD, and I still enjoy listening to it every now and again, but I much prefer ""Whatever Gets You Through The Day"". If you're new to the Lighthouse Family, I'd go over and check that one out first. If you've already got that one and want some more, I'd say get this CD, but don't expect greatness."
3,SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT FIVE STARS BUT..,"I am not sure if it is Lighthouse Family's idea or their record company's suggestion about changing the versions of some songs for their official videos but I'm not liking it at all. What's the point of releasing an album if you're just gonna make changes on the video version? (The versions on lighthouse family's videos are usually better). To me it's unfair. I mean come on !! Yes, this is a good album with good songs to unwind with. BUT im still disappointed with the changes in the song versions (example is ""High"" which used the 7 inch edit in the video version and the song ""Lost in Space"" which uses the single mix in its official music video version, which also shows the then newly finished Angel of the North structure.)"
1,"MELANIE DOES IT AGAIN AND AGAIN, YAWN","I still await the day when Melanie will release an album of new material. Her tagic flaw as a performer is the constant need she has to record her old songs over and over again. Melanie has incredible talent but the world will never know this. This album is so careless it makes one wonder if she has learned nothing from working with some of the top people in the industry. The inclusion of the song ""Ring the Living Bell"" only showcases how much range her voice has lost over the years. Her voice was her ace in the can , but now it is just a sad reminder of what it once was. Melanie needs to stop recording these old songs and join the 21st century."
2,Voice muffled in the tribute,"As a dedicated fan of Eva Cassidy's music (my wife and I own all of her CD's), it is amazing to me that this batch of songs was released at all, especially under the title ""No Boundaries."" This tribute saddened me. The recordings on the CD (not a single good track) place her spiraling voice against a wall in an overcrowded room. Her ""boundless"" talent is treated as a secondary instrument; she deserved so much better. I implore people who have never experienced Eva's amazing vocal abilities to leave this CD alone and purchase one that puts Eva on center stage. For example, this CD has none of the intimacy, energy and improvisational surprise of ""Live at Blue's Alley."" If the uninitiatied find Eva through another avenue, they'll fall in love with her spirit, and with jazz."
2,not the eva i love,"this collection of her early session tapes seems like eva doing a parody of whitney houston. i've loved eva's work from the first time i heard her sing ""i know you by heart"" on christmas day of 1999. since then, i've acquired all of her discs, this one being the most recent. it's nice to have, the photographs are wonderful, but i won't listen to it often. it just isn't the eva that she wanted to be and did so well on songbird, eva by heart, blues alley and time after time. this one, i'm afraid, would have been better off unreleased."
2,Just from samples you can tell this isn't good.,"Yes, the much maligned No Boundaries is exactly as people say it is. When you can tell just from the song samples, it's probably even worse in full length. I hope one day, the only decent song on here, #10 Natural Woman is added to some newly discovered Eva music that seem to turn up every few years. These songs do not sound at all like the Eva we know and love."
4,Beginnings,"Coming home yesterday, our train rolled across the river, a plane rose into the sky and, further north, bright pink clouds lingered in the deepening blue. I listened to No Boundaries in the evening. The songs include a flowing voice singing ""Natural Woman"" and piano notes echoing gently like spring rains. Her music continued to develop and grow through the seasons."
1,I Really Wanted to Like This One,I have the other 4 main Eva CD's and really like her style and the way she gave her own meaning and depth to songs. That didn't show thru in this CD. It was all just loud without the great vocal quality evidenced in her other work. Buy the other four instead!
5,Mogul Skiing Booklet,"This was a very well written book about skiing moguls. It was encouraging and insightful (especially about those ""professionals"" on many ski hills in the Midwest who don't really ski moguls). This is coming from someone who started skiing moguls at age 30 and still enjoys them at 45. Advice for those just starting out--no matter what your age: don't be afraid to ask anyone who skis the bumps well, for some tips. Also, ignore most of the advice you receive from ""professional"" ski instructors, even those that are PSIA III certified."
4,Sunbonnet Sue,This book came on time in the mail in good conditions as it was described when I placed the order.
1,Major Disappointment,"They scanned the pages and then compressed them into JPEGs. Even a top quality laser printer can't help the grey, smeary text output. If you like reading blurred text in a post card size window you'll be satisfied. Otherwise you're better off going to a library. I'm gonna sell my copy or give it away."
3,They charge extra for color!,"These labels are very nice for eyes that are starting to fail, and they stand up to a beating.Good filing materials are worth spending a bit extra ... BUT, Smead charges EXTRA for new software if you want to use your color printer instead of everything in black and white!That's so short-sighted of them, and foolish.The software works fine, but you can just set the labels up for printing in your word processor and forget SMEAD's software, which is antiquated anyway."
4,Great insite,Passing for normal gives the reader great insight on life with OCD and Tourette's. It talks about her very first tic to her treatment that she has today. Amy is very open about her problems in this outstanding memoir. I also have OCD and can relate to many of her stories. This book also gives hope to reader's.
1,This does not sound like Japanese flute playing,"I listened to the cd. My son played it in the cd player and it sounded like a European type of flute melody. As I viewd the CD I realized the flute palyer is not A Japanese, but a European. I sent it back to Amazon.You too will hear the difference."
5,Ethereal,"I concur that this is an outstanding CD, a worthwhile addition to anycollection. I suggest, however, that you first take a look at""Japanese Melodies"" under the Denon label (an alias ofColumbia Records Japan), catalogue #8115. Denon gives you the sameperformances by Rampal and Laskine for ... less. The only tradeoff isthat Denon changes the order of the tracks and omits the first one onthis CD, Haru No Umi, and thus is 7 minutes shorter (44 vs 51minutes)."
3,Cute bean bag,Purchased for my son who loved it until the vinyl started wearing on some of the seams and the filling leaked out. I patched it up and it's been fine. Just disappointed I had to do this.
4,A formal treatment of the psycoanalytic aspects of the film,"This book has laid a fundation for understanding the film from a psychoanalytic perspective. The author re-examined the visual style of the film, its narrative structure, the historical context during production and the director's political activities, discovered new facts and finally came to an interpretation in psychoanalytic terms in which all the clues would fall into places. Although some of the arguments were not given in full length and rigidness (there are only 87 pages), this book certainly built a new system of meanings regarding the film that includes many facts discovered in the past several decades."
5,A great reference,"This text is a great reference for statistical inference in the presence of ordering or shape restrictions. Isotonic regression, tests for trends and shape restrictions, and many other applied methodologies are presented clearly with illustrative examples. There is a strong theoretical presentation as well, viewing an isotonic regression function simple as a solution to a L2 restricted minimization problem. This blend of theory and application make this an integral text to have at your disposal."
3,doesnt showcase Ms. Labelle well as Labelle,A couple of songs stand the test of time and appeal to my modern ear. The Patti Labelle songs to do NOT showcase Ms. Labelle as beautifully as the songcraft of the Labelle (the group) discography.
1,not interesting,"Not nearly as inspiring at it sounds on paper. The only decent tracks are the Steve Roach and Robert Rich ones, and they're certainly not their best work. Others on the record are just guys seemingly randomly screwing around with their keyboards in perfect, expensive studios; not very interesting to me. A real wasted opportunity, IMO, I mean, Dali's stuff is crazy great! But I didn't get an impression of his works from any of this music. The liner notes were the best part, aside from the concept of the album itself. Pass...."
4,Boomer Memories,Some of the pun references are so old that they would not be understood today. And of course some of the characterizations might now be considered insensitive and politically incorrect. In spite of all that Peabody is a very witty and funny know-it-all. I can watch this repeatedly and not get bored.
2,Save your money,Not as informative as I expected. You would be better off buying a book about low light photography.
2,good for novice photographers,I bought this book after I started doing concert photography. What happened to me was all the problems I encountered and solved were repeated in the book. I read it very quickly and learnt nothing from it although I believe first time concert photographers will gain something with this book. I gave it 2 stars for that.
3,Probably a great book 10 yrs ago,This book seems like it has a lot of great info for shooting in the 90s. Unfortunately it is in major need of an update. It was published in 1997 and cites references to many magazines that aren't published anymore as well as what film to use. While great in concept I definitely encourage the author to update update update!
5,Concert Photography,"Concert Photography could very well be the finest book on photography that I have read. It touches on many aspects of photography while offering advice specific to concert photography. It is very well written, and written so that any level of photographer can enjoy. I did not want to put it down. Jon offers several tips on film, cameras dealing with managers, band members and just about anything you could possibly want to know. Even though I have shot several concerts there were still many tips that will help me in the future. I recommend this book as much as any thing can be recommended. Read and enjoy!"
4,Dates better,"Just started the book and I have already seen where I have been slipping. We have been emptynesters for 3 years and I had forgotten how to date as a married person, we have been married for 37 and things have changed a lot. Can't wait to get deeper in our dating process."
3,Juve the Great,"This album was very good compared to the last. Track 17, Slow Motion, the track called Numb,Numb, and Head in Advance are some of my favorite tracks off the album. If you are a Juve fan, it is a must have album. The skits however does take away from the quality of the album, but I still would give this album 3.5 stars. So it is definitely worth buying."
2,mmm....to much hype,"This album was NOT that good....I know that he's gotten older now and his lyrics are different, but hey, it could be so much better...i dont know what happend? I gave it 2 because I respect him and what he's dun in the past, but ill try to forget about this album"
1,Dissapointing--skip this,"juve is one of my fave rappers, but this sounds eclectic, unneccersarily violent and does not have any hits. the songs just aren't strong enough. it seems like he rushed this album and didn't know what he wanted to do musically. the only thing listenable is definitely ""slow motion."" it has a soft, melodic sound that you wouldn't expect from Juve or a rapper, but it works (seems like genius only struck them once in the studio when they came up with this song), and ""it ain't mines."" it is an interesting song. other than those 2, everything else sounds tired."
2,it's like he never left,"juve was'nt so great when he departed the williams now was he he tried to go solo but now he's back on cash money making more trashy records about cars, money and how many girls he's gonna penetrate yeah welcome back juve holla bg might come back next turk's incarcerated right now."
4,This cd is so 4 stars,"this cd could have been 5 if mannie fresh did the hole cd if you dont bump this disc at least download bounce back feat babyR.I.P.Soulja SlimFavorite Track:Bounce Back and Slow MotionGuests:Mannie Fresh,Baby,Skip & Wacko,Soulja Slim8 of 10 lyrics 7 of 10 beats"
1,"""Sales-Pitch for Faith""","Ohhhh, this book is so bad on so many levels I don't know where to begin. First, it's obvious the writer is no more than casually familiar with the theological, philisophical, archaeological and even scientific literature.2nd, I'd be ashamed to be a scientist and publish something that is obviously so one sided. As correctly pointed out by other reviewers, the philosphical arguments (e.g., First Cause) have been addressed and debunked over the past 2-hundred years. The archaeological evidence that he claims shows that the bible is historically accurate have been soundly criticized. the text itself contains many internal inconsistencies, etc. This is a book of blind faith and salesmanship, not a scholarly work. Unfortunately, it pretends to be the latter3rd. Oh yes, the author needs a refresher course in the scientific method, the historical method, the scholarship of the bible, etc., etc."
5,Keys to your future,"Dr. Uchil writes in compact, easy to digest chapters about the broad sweep of ideas necessary to successfully navigate the corporate world. ""Essential Information"" can be viewed as vital intelligence to get your plans lined up with your goals, especially for those retiring from/leaving one career and seeking an exciting and radically different one in the corporate marketplace. I have used this candid guide to chart my own course and, when discussing life plans with friends, his words often come to mind. I have already recommended this book to several friends on the verge of major career decisions."
1,Cute pics- but terrible translation,"We have the book Blue Hat, Green Hat in English and my son loves itI thought it would be fun to add the Spanish version to our library and (foolishly) didn't take enough time to really read the title. The book is translated literally from English into Spanish- which makes a terrible translation as the word order is different in both languages. The English version starts ""blue hat, green hat..."" The Spanish version starts ""azul el sombrero, verde el sombrero..."" which is WRONG it should be ""el sombrero azul, el sombrero verde....""Anyone who actually speaks Spanish should know just by looking at the title- unless (like me) they made a quick decision based on the cuteness and enjoyment of the English versionso...if you want to just label colors or items in Spanish I guess it is fine, but if you actually want to read a story that makes sense or has appropriate word order- SKIP IT"
3,"This is not a lot of help for the beginer, unfortunately","Good side: CD tracksWeak sides: method is poorly developed, fingering charts are hardly visible , there are very few exercises.It's good as a reference, but it's definitely not a N1 guide to study flute for a beginer.One interesting detail: this book has no author !"
4,Almost the Best,I got this book to go along with my new pokemon silver game. It really is a great guide. It has pokemon information and great chapters. The only problem is that it gives away the ending. It told me all the secrets so it really wasn't fun to find them out on my own. I recommend the Versus Guide for Pokemon Gold/Silver. It doesn't give away secrets and is a little bit more in depth.
3,Not her best - intriguing but gory,"Was very disappointed by this novel because it was quite gory, although the story was intriguing. Suspect (or hope, maybe) that the disgusting parts were Michael Scott's influence and that Morgan will do her own thing from now on. Have read everything published that she has written, as a quick and easy way to learn Celtic lore and adored them all, even the historic novel 1916 about the Irish revolution."
3,"Decent work out, but not for the beginner","The workouts described in this book are effective; I was able to firm my admittedly softening belly in a matter of weeks -- but I would not recommend this book for beginners or those with back problems. The exercises listed tend to be more advanced, and the instructions are less detailed then they could be (for example, the author does not provide tips for limitting back or neck strain). As a good travel companion or for a quick work out, the book is great; but for a more comprehensive routine, or for those who prefer more detailed instruction, this may not be for you."
3,Facts not straight,"The product title and description do not match. In some places, it is 8'x6' (EZ86) and in others it is 8'x9'."
5,A real page turner!! Just could not put this book down!!,I thought the Devils Tower was a great read. This sequel is even better!!! I literally could not put this book down! It was like a roller coaster ride. Full of twists and turns everywhere. You cannot go wrong by taking the time to read this book.
5,Great book on buying a home in Seattle and the Puget Sound,".Seattle Homes is loaded with info specific to Seattle and the Puget Sound while still serving as complete manual for a first timer like myself.After paddling about Lake Union a few weeks back, I decided to check the multiple listings for houseboats. I couldn't figure out why two seemingly identical homes would vary in price by over $100,000. Now I know.The reviewer who said the book has nothing to do with Seattle must not have read past page 49. The remaining 400+ pages focus on the Seattle area, in addition to providing a thorough general education in the ins and outs of buying, selling, and investing in real estate.Definitely a must read, if you're looking to buy a home or invest in property."
5,Informative & Interesting!,"Inheriting the Holy Land is a novel that inspires one to really uncover what is commonly overlooked: the young people in the world today. Jennifer Miller, age 24, sheds light on the young adults trying to work their way towards reconciliation of long conceived judgments and hostilities, yet finding many obstacles along the way. Miller, a graduate of the International Seeds of Peace camp, traces her way back to other campers presently living in Israel, whether they be Israelis, Arabs, or even Israeli-Arabs. Regardless of their background, she acts as the mediator, trying to bring a hope for peace to the people that will be shaping the future conflicts and agreements. Overall, Miller provides a great deal of historical information to back up her story and gives us hope for a peaceful future for the Middle East and its people."
1,VCAT was discontinued in 2003,"The VCAT test was discontinued in April 2003. Go to [...] for information on North American Veterinary Schools and their test requirements. Also, any .com's which refer to the VCAT test as relevant are out of date and perhaps unreliable. Posted from PreVetAdvising.com"
5,Sweet and fun,"I really love this Hippo so soft and cuddly, she's was a gift for a friend who loves hippos as I do. This one is not only really cute it's also fun for online playing as are all Webkinz. Enjoy this fluffy hippo I recommend it."
3,"excellent show, bad sound","this is one of the best avail live albums performance wise, but is the worst sound quality wise. it is an incredibly powerful show with a great setlist of some of there best songs. go for one of the other live albums."
1,broke after 31 days,part did fit but after 31 days the part broke. according to Dorman the part is warrantied for life and you need to return it to where you bought the part(amazon)I called customer service and at first they told me I could not return it because I was 2 days past their return policy. they told me to send it to Dorman which you can't do. after being on the phone for 30 minutes they finally told me I could return it to amazon for a refund. they paid for the return freight and within 3 days I had my money back on the credit card.this is the first time I had problems dealing with Amazon.Kevin
3,unbelievable,"In an effort to make this game as real as possible, it seems that designers decided that dunking and driving the lane are not part of the NBA. I disagree, but then again I only watch NBA games I don't design them. A graphically superb product is dragged down by completely unbelievable gameplay. Can anyone please explain why my player would do a fadeaway jumper on a fast break? Over and over?? I understand that jump shooting and defense are necessary parts of the experience, but DANG! I should be able to complete a dunk on a one-on-none fast break.Maybe basketball is just to fluid of a game in real life to translate well to a gaming console."
2,Must be that nice smell,Must be that nice smell that's attracting all of these mosquitoes. Next time I'll get a DEET-based spray that smells bad.
5,Fantastic! Couldn't put it down!,"This story was Perfect! Ruark is a true dream man! Summer, she was the perfect match for him! Rory was quite spectacular as well (hmmm...wonder why?)I love reading of willfull, headstrong women and dominating men...they eventually come to a draw - but getting there is half the fun. Virginia is detailed right down to the food the characters eat, beautiful fashions, hot & steamy passions - she doesnt leave anything out. Piracy, plague, sex, intrigue and binding love - Virginia's a master at her craft. I love all of her books and there is no comparison to her writing style!"
4,Just the right length.,"I recently had to read this book for an American history class. Yes it is somewhat short but that being said it is the perfect length for a busy college student. It provides a plethora of great quotes and delivers the general overview of FDR's time in office in a very interesting light. All in all, if you simply want to learn more than your typical high school lesson on one of America's greatest presidents, this is the book for you."
5,This product works great!,"This stuff is amazing. I'm not hungry at all after taking it. It doesn't make my jittery like some other products I have tried. It's a miracle! Apparently it doesn't work for everyone because a friend at work tried it and it didn't do a thing for her (she only tried one dose). I haven't been able to get other people to try it. I see from the other reviews that it may not work for everyone. I'm just thankful that it works for me. I've lost about 33 pounds in 60 days! I've recently added glucomanna (do a search on it) to my regimen. This hoodia combined with glucomanna is the ultimate weight loss supplement. Just a word of caution though; it only makes the hunger pangs go away. If you eat because of an addiction, these products probably won't help you. Proper exercise and nutrition is also very essential."
1,limited value,"For an adult beginner, this book is of very limited value. It cannot be used to learn the piano, but is only a general guide for someone who already has a substantial musical background. I would not buy this book if you are an absolute beginner other than to read a sometimes interesting story about how a more advanced player practices and learns to play the piano"
3,Okay but not the best,I thought this book would be a little more informative. It's cute and funny but I wish it had more information on the miracle of redheads!
1,Save your money and time ( Gave it 'One Star' by Force'),"Save your money and time, this movie is not worth it. This is One of the worst movies I've seen so far. It has nothing to do with the title of the movie but with the acting, Willem Dafoe & Harvey Keitel tried their best to act their worst. I don't know what Martin Scorsese was thinking when he directed this joke.Maybe he could not afford the money for better actors and even the extras in this movie are as bad as the actors.I think Mr Scorsese was asleep at the chair while these clowns were making fools of themselves and him. Someone should had shouted, CUT!Anyways save your money is 2004 21st century maybe something better will come around ( maybe already has, a new director Mel Gibson ) What a PASSION for a movie."
5,Faith-Stretcher!,"Want to be stretched in your faith stance? Watch the ""Last Temptation of Christ"". Dealing with the humanity of Jesus is always a ticklish endeavor, and Willem Dafoe et al. pull it off. Some folks make not like it; they may even hate it. However, one cannot see this flim and come away neutral. It demands a response. A great discussion-starter."
3,Mildly interesting. Not controversial at all.,"Not a bad depiction of Christ and the difficulties he dealt with trying to understand his role in life. Defoe isn't very magnetic in his role in this movie, and he gets headaches a lot, during which he's hearing the voice of God. Keitel sounds like he's trying to imitate a NYPD officer instead of a disciple of Christ. The desert photography is incredible.All the demonstrations and controversy about this back in 88 was somewhat ill-placed. So what if it shows Christ thinking about having sex? Sex is kind of an important part of marriage and fatherhood, which I'm sure Christ thought about more than once. How else could he have known that to think of sin is the same as committing sin?This flick is a bit of a snoozer, though. Be good and awake before you start it.-- JJ Timmins"
2,Okay. Problematic.,"Lots of interest in this movie. Unfortunately, Willem Dafoe is not up to the task of carrying an entire movie. He has a disturbing lack of presence, most apparent when he is onscreen with David Bowie as Pontius Pilate. I shouldn't leave a movie about Jesus thinking that Pontius Pilate was the most interesting character. There is a lot of unintentional comedy, usually thanks to the New York accents of significant cast members. You didn't know that Judas Iscariot came from Brooklyn, did you?Ultimately, though, it is worth a look, if only to see what was making so many people so angry. The answer is: not much. Anyone who looks at this movie with any degree of seriousness will see that it is not blasphemous, not really. It is often tasteless, and even rather embarassing, but the sincerity of the filmmakers' desire to depict the struggle of the spirit and the flesh as experienced by Jesus Christ shines through."
2,Scorcese should stick to gratuitous violence,"With all the hype, I started this movie expecting to be offended. But that didn't happen.However: I WAS bored overall. I WAS confused -- by the lack of continuity in storyline. I WAS bewildered -- that someone actually got financial backing for this turkey. But mostly, I WAS disappointed -- poor Scorcese was clearly out of his element, what with no slo-mo massacres and no chainsaw murders."
2,PQ not as should be,"Very good movie about christ, not based in the Gospels, just speculation, imagination of the author, but very interesting. Iam very dissapointed with the Picture Quality of the movie. Most of the time the picture look washed out, many scenes plagued of grain, mostly the dark scenes, and in general the movie look lifeless. I remember I saw this movie in theaters and looked beautiful. I expected very nice transfer in the bluray, unfortunately the Criterion did not do a good job with this release. Dont buy this release, It is expensive and you will waste your money, most likely they will come out with another ""cleaned"" version."
2,wish it fit,"Great price! looks like a great product, but no way to tell for sure. Bulb does not fit on my 07 Prius. My guess is that if your car's backup lens can be easily removed so this bulb could be put in base first, it might fit. On my Prius where the light goes in bulb first - the bulb is too fat to fit through the hole. It would have been nice to know that before I bought the bulbs. I'll hold on to them in hopes I can find a car they will fit."
1,Doesn't Fit,"They work great but they do not fit in the socket! So do not buy this item unless you want to have to do some ""customising"" to the bulb socket (which will make it impossible to keep the bulb in place)."
5,"Splendor, glamour, beauty, versatility, and velvet voice!","What else may you request of a singer? She was the sum of these adjectives and even more, according to trustworthy testimonies of people much older than me who had the honor to appreciate her craft in live performances.Few singers have the requested versatility and the necessary voice to get that so well know pieces of the repertoire sound so fresh and rich.Brenda Lee is a singer which offers us every sound as we had not ever listened never before, being that hard to find quality the basis of his applauded popularity.It has been said about her, she was a very dedicated artist in every detail; yes indeed. she and Connie Francis incarnated the essential profile of the beloved sixties girl. One of my loves of youth and remind this comment of Jimmy Mc Hugh composer of Don't blame that ""she was in those ages the number one singer in the world"" ."
5,Great Hits,We bought this CD because it has Tampico Hermoso. The sound quality is excellent for all songs and Antonio Aguilar's talent shines brightly in these Ranchero Hits. All songs are in Spanish and have a Macho Mexicano flavor. This would be a good CD for late-night around the campfire at parties.
5,BEST GAME ALL DAY,On The Real Best GTA I Have No Words For This Game Is Number #1 Haters Fallback Rockstar Is Doing It Big Hard Body
5,Unbelievably talented,"If you are a guitarist or musician, you will love this disc.John Mayer opens with an acoustic set, then a set with the Trio, and finally the full band.Every bit of feeling / emotion comes out in his playing.You cant go wrong !Sit back and enjoy, this guy is unbelievably talented !"
4,It's Good,"I mean it's REALLY good! You get to see John Mayer as all 3 acts in one show. 3 words, A-maz-ing!"
5,JM,"What can I say? It's John Mayer......his voice is amazing, he's magic on the guitar and what can be better than seeing it live. If you are a JM fan and you don't have this dvd already......then shame on you........BUY IT NOW :)"
4,great performer!!! but i dont want to hear about his love life...,"AWESOME PERFORMANCE! He is truely a gifted musician. But seriously, I can't stand it when they start talking about their lives, or try to make a joke. He is no comedian, and i dont care about his love life. 5 stars if he had just performed."
2,pulsar ladies Sports watch review - PXX010 -,"I have had this watch for a couple of weeks. At first I loved it, then the day of the week and numberic day of the month started messing up. Everyday, I have to adjust both day of week and the month numeric date. I have hadpulsar's in the past and have had good luck with them. But this one is not anywhere near the quality I have grown to expect from Pulsar. It doesseem to keep good time or I would have given it a lower rating. I do like to looks and the way it fits. The daily ""adjustment"" is very frustrating - and some days more than one ""adjustment"" must be made."
5,CLASSIC BOC,A great remaster of this old classic. The extra songs included on this CD were a good addition that fit the style of this album. BOC's sound changes all the time and these songs are fun to listen to.
3,Got this because I was an extra in this movie when I was 16.,"While walking down Melrose Ave. in Hollywood with my mom and our eccentric landlady,who was trying to pettle her old fur coats to passers by on the street. We caught the attention of a monkey coat clad director with her actions and my bewitching teen Gothic looks. Our small scene captured a bad free perm on my normally rad Siouxsie type doo and the glory of classic Melrose.PsIt is a decent vampire flick.PssThe director looked like a hot cartoon devil type and the male hair dresser who ruined my cool doo was a hot bald guy whom I met on Melrose too."
1,worked ok until it stopped,"Had this for about a month and a half before it quit working entirely. While working, it did a fine job of heating my infant son's small room while the rest of the house dropped to 64 degrees on the programmable thermostat. Then I woke up one morning to find his room was 64 degrees just like the rest of the house. The heater was on (power light on) but not putting out any heat. The electrical outlet works with other appliances. I can't find a reset button anywhere on the unit. Apparently I'm not the first to experience this problem. I wouldn't recommend this heater."
1,Bad,"Heater worked for a couple of months and stopped. I was expecting it to last for a significant period of time years. Its not like the technology is new or complex. All it needs to do is work. We called customer support at KAZ (KAZ is the MFg and servicer) and were told it would take 6 weeks to get a replacement. So basically, we could get the heater back after winter had mostly passed. Asked if we could return it and were told we would need to talk to Honeywell directly. Customer service closed. Only open during normal business hours. Very helpful for those of us that are employed and working a normal schedule."
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"Not much in the way of forced air (i.e., fan) but very good for a medium sized room. Quiet. Good price."
1,"Works well for a couple of years, then dies!","This is our 3rd Honeywell baseboard heater. None of them lasted very long....this one, just under 3 years, worked OK then all of a sudden, like the others, it's dead. Honeywell will replace it (about 4 cold weeks) but again, I have to pay expensive ground shipping. I will try and avoid Honeywell in the future. It just doesn't make quality."
2,"Worked great, for four months","Bought a Honeywell HZ-617 based on the the reviews I read in a highly respected product evaluation magazine of simular Honeywell models.Product woked as described for four months. One of the wires to the heating element fried. I not having the receipt, I repaired the wire and got it working again, for about more two weeks (the wire fried again). Headed to the trash heap. I have rarely been so disappointed in a product."
2,"unit got hot, room did not",The body of this unit got too hot to touch but didn't put sufficient warmth into the room. I returned it and took my lump over the return shipping fee. I would not recommend this to anyone with small children or anyone who might want to change its location once it got heated up.I have another Honeywell space heater that I love but it is not the low profile type like this one.
3,OK,I'm not sure about this heater. It works well but it is long and I seem to hit my toes on it often. It is very very quiet though so could be used anywhere. I guess I am just used to tall cylinder heaters.
3,Spellbinding War of Nerves,"The Bureau wants Quiller back. Why? He had the audacity to resign after his own people planted a bomb to do him in during the last assignment. But he won't go back. Quiller turns freelance (he thinks) in Adam Hall's suspenseful romp about a Cambodian-born female druglord, Mariko Shoda, out to wreak chaos and stage simultaneous coups-de-etat across the nations of SE Asia. Quiller's job is to find and kill her, well, not quite kill...first he must prevent her getting her hands on a shipment of Slingshot anti-aircraft missiles -- obviously patterned after the real-life Stinger -- that are the linchpin of her plan. But Shoda has him in her sights and tries to have Q killed almost before he gets out of the starting blocks, triggering a very personal war of nerves that can only end with one victor."
1,Crap!,"The regulator broke moments after filling the tank. The adjustment knob started leaking at first, then blew totally off. Aviod this product, it is cheap and will break."
5,purchased as a gift,I purchased this bible for my daughter in law. She was accomplished in speaking English butreading in her native language gave her a better understanding of the Bible.
4,Finally! a CD with The Lost T-Shirts of Atlantis,"Last saw the T-Shirts at Kingston Fair, near London, England. Great to hear 4 of their tracks on this CD: Cripple Creek; Green; Luv, Luv; and Wipe Out. This whole CD is thigh-slappin', toe-tappin' mix, with an extra healthy topping of banjo. If anyone knows of any other CD's with the T-Shirts, please drop me a line."
2,"Great Chandler Story, not so Great Elliot Gould performance","The story is typical Chandler, aside from the debate about twelve(12) versus four(4) short stories.Typical action,mystery and complicated, fascinating plot.But Elliot Gould is no Ed Bishop as Philip Marlowe(the early BBC radio dramatization series), nor is he Toby Stephens -the later BBC Philip Marlowe attempt. Gould can put you to sleep very easily performing Johnny Dalmas as theL.A. private eye."
5,The crime master,"Here we have another four novellas from one of the masters of the crime story.The four stories all have Philip Marlowe on board helping the helpless and not getting much thanks for it.The book title - Trouble is my Business- is the pick of the tales included here where all is not as it seems, which is usually the way.As per all Marlowe stories all concerned drink gallons of whiskey and smoke for the Olympics as we see the seedy side of Los Angeles.Highly recommended for fans and anyone who like a great crime story."
1,Do not purchase,"I've read only the first chapter, but it's enough for me to know it's not a good book. The entire first chapter is spent on nouns, in more detail than is necessary to present at the start. After learning only nouns and the basics of adjectives, the book then asks the reader to translate full sentences from English to Italian. Many of the exercises involve words not actually yet taught.Poorly written, poorly presented, with typographical mistakes---this book appears to not actually have been edited or tested. DO NOT PURCHASE>"
5,Text Books Don't Make it on Fire.,"The book is good, but there is a problem using text books on Kindle or Fire. You can not search or go back and forth easy to check answers. Also it would be good if you could fill in answers instead of having to write on a paper. The book itself is excellent. Well written and setup."
5,Excelente,"A mi me ha gustado mucho, Es una literatura dinamica que engancha desde el principio, una trama interesante, Yo la recomiendo"
4,Muy bueno,"Este es un muy buen libro, yo nunca había leído nada de este autor cuando compré el libro, me pareció muy bueno, al inicio en cierta forma me aburría pero conforme iba avanzando se iba poniendo cada vez más interesante hasta que al final me encantó.Una muy buena historia!"
5,Provoca un misterioso placer,"El libro cayo de la nada en mis brasos y ya pienso en volver a leerlo. Cada capitulo te acerca mas al misterio llenandote de dudas. Pero tambien es la historia de vida de un niño envuelto en libros. Uno de estos libros lo mete en un gran lio, pero la trama se desenvuelve pragmaticamente y con gran encanto. Lectura obligatoria para cualquiera."
5,Marvelous book,"This book beginning/ending is a masterpiece in its own right, and every page in between is a celebration of great storytelling. One of the best books I've ever read."
5,Uno de esos libros que nunca quieres que se acabe,"lo encontre por casualidad, leyendo los reviews de otras personas que como yo, tuvieron la suerte de encontrarse con este libro. es una historia preciosa, que te hace reir y llorar, con personajes divertidos, misteriosos, y una increible historia de amor. Ojala me encuentre con mas libros como este."
5,Great workout,This video makes me sweat. I almost didn't buy it due to its horrible name but I am so glad I did. There are some higher impact exercise but the trainer takes care to show you the lower impact moves as well. I love it!
1,10 Days to a Better Body,I actually received a different video by a different insturctor encased in the 10 Days to a Better Body case so I was quite disappointed. I was expecting the video to have two 30 minute routines and the one I received called Boost Your Metabolism was a 50 minute video workout.
4,Received broken,"Received the marble cheese cutters today. Yes two in one shipping box. They arrived with no soft packing, had one air bag on top in a sturdy box. Airbag was deflated on arrival. One marble base broken across where the wire slit is in it so totally unusable. Second marble base survived shipping but for some reason the wire was broken when I took it out of it's box. Since marble is very brittle it would make sense to have such items packed with more cushioning material. With the legs on the ends and a score across the marble any sharp jar is likely to break it. From other reviews it seems a lot of wires come broken. Cannot see what would cause breakage."
4,Slicer,Sturdy and easily slices thru different types of cheeses but doesn't work well with harder cheese blocks could be alittle wider.
3,cheese cutter,"The cheese cutter was very durable, but it lacked in the ability to cut very well. When the slicer comes down to slice it is quite wobbly when cutting. The groove in the marble board is NOT deep enough."
2,"great design, lousy product","Well, I'd read some pretty good reviews of this product, but I was dissappointed. The wire was quite thin and had trouble cutting your basic cheddar block. The score in the marble wasn't deep enough to cut the cheese all the way to the bottom, and the handle wasn't strong enough to keep it cutting in a straight line - it took a lot of guidance and care to cut a uniform piece of cheese. Then, the marble handle came off in my hand within the third or fourth use - along with the wire. My husband was able to put it all back together, but it was too late for me to feel good about this item.I'm returning it."
2,It's not worth buying really..,"While it is made of marble that's where the nice parts really end on it. The arm of it is shorter than I thought so bulk cheese couldn't be cut as it was too large, and worst of all the legs on the bottom are glued on and I had one fall off.I'll just save my money and buy a decent deli slicer."
2,Cheese slicer,"Cheese cutter quality was good. However, the cutting wire would not lock-in on the metal slicer bar. The slicer groove was inside the marble platform. Move the marble cutting slot and problem would be solved. I had to regroove the cutting bar to make the cutting wire stay in place. (Manufacture error.)"
5,Cuts Cheese,"It does what it's supposed to do. Blah blah blah blah and I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that it cuts cheese"
4,Astrolagy through a psychic s eyes,This is a good book. I do not read much on astrolagy but the auther is one of my favorites. If you are a fan of astrolagy this would be a great book to read
1,Not impressed at all!,"This is also the first time I took the time to review a book. I was not impressed at all. Studying astrology part time for years, I was downright disturbed by some of her statements. She seems to contradict many things through the years I have read over and over again, and found to be true. She should have called this book ""How she see other signs"", period. It seems to be her personal opinion mainly. Humor I honestly can say I never laugh out loud once. Want a funny book on astrology that also is accurate, ""Born on a rotten day"" by Hazel Dixon-Cooper. In my opinion, Sylvia is on an extreme prolific writing kick where she will publish just about anything to make more money. This is the last book I will buy from hers for a long time."
1,Somebody Got Burned By A Taurus,"If I could have I wouldn't have given this book any stars. I looked through this book in a bookstore and the only thing I could gather from her descriptions of people of the different signs is that Sylvia must have gotten seriously burned by a Taurus. I looked through a few of the different signs and she obviously holds quite a bit of resentment towards Taureans. Furthermore, the ""valid"" or ""well-known"" descriptions that she offers for the various signs are the same descriptions you could find in ANY OTHER ASTROLOGY book. I wouldn't waste your time or money for there is NOTHING PROFOUND OR ENLIGHTENING about her book. I also think Sylvia needs to seek guidance from her spirit guides on releasing her anger and resentment towards Taureans."
1,No Astrology advice here,"I was very disappointed in this book. It should have been entitled "" A humourous view of astrology through a psychic's eyes"" She clearly is poking fun but I found it rather mean-spirited. For example: see her take on those born under the sign of Taurus. (MEOWWWW) Sylvia those claws you have are becoming longer with the more money you make!"
4,"Funny, interesting","Great book from Sylvia as always. The book puts a little humor into the world of astrology. Don't agree with all aspects, but still a great book to read."
3,No storyline,We like The Dragon Tales...I was disappointed in this; there is no storyline that I thought would go along with the sing and dance part...guess I will know better next time. If I had known I would have bought one on the same as the cartoon as on television.Just not what I thought it would be!!!
2,Weak analysis,"Some instructive positions, but this book was written prior to strong computers, and it is clear now that the analysis is generally rather weak, certainly not at a GM level."
4,Conspracy theory?,"Edge of your seat suspense, stellar cast, nifty multi-screen sequences. So why is the ONLY copy available a used VHS for 30 bucks???!!! Could it be because this movie has been suppressed? The premise being that the reason for U.S. involvement in Vietnam was to show the Soviets just how cruel we could be, and that we would push the button, if it came down to it."
3,Kids' Absolado,I and my son were not impressed with these shoes. They look nice but had a plastic feel and were not as comfortable as his nike.
2,Music interesting but bad disc/packaging,"You can get a sense of the music on this disc by reading the earlier reviews, but the quality of the package leaves much to be desired. First, it's a CD-R, complete with homemade label and injet printed inserts. Secondly, many of the tracks have excessive hiss or other sonic problems. The first disc I received wouldn't play past track 7, the replacement (swiftly done by Amazon - thanks!) still had problems in some players, but I could listen to it. Well... most of it, some of the time. Possibly some of these problems might be caused by degradation of the CDR in the now 5 year old release."
5,I love it,"This book is hilarious! I couldn't stop reading it when I got it. It seriously made me laugh so hard, and it actually DOES have some good tips!! Buy this book...."
4,This is actually a cookbook!,"I bought this for my husband, he loves Amy Sedaris. Well, Christmas morning I opened up the book and realized that is it a real cookbook! There are some very funny stories and party ideas."
2,uhm... I don't get it.,"I bought the audio CD version of this book... and I can't wait for it to end! Ok, there are ""some"" funny parts in it (hence the 2 stars), but for the most part... it's just not funny!!?? trust me, I love good humor, but this is just not it. You want funny? read anything by Christopher Moore - ""Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff"" or ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" (same author), or even ""You Suck""! now THAT stuff is funny!! ""Amy Sedaris""?? ...sorry, not funny."
2,I like you: Hospitality Under the Influence,"Enjoyed the format and the down-to-earth commentary. There were a few areas of which I found offensive. With the thought of young people (actually anyoen who believes in taking care of themselves), I would not want them reading this book which rationalizes poor behaviors, ie: showing a picture of the author choosing between alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. The author says that when she has parties, she caters to all her guests, not judging their choice of DRUGS - meaning it's ok for them to use drugs in her home. There were several other areas of concern but after I read the rationalizing of behaviors that hurt people, it wasn't for me and it wouldn't be for my friends. I'm not a fuddy duddy but see No value in OKing drug use. I sent the book back."
1,one click mistake!!,"This book is awful - truly unfunny and poorly written. I am embarassed to have been misled by the reviews into buying it.It's supposed to be a hospitality book, but isn't. The worst part are the pictures - I truly do not have the verbal ability to describe how trashy, strange and ugly the pictures are. She has put her tips, recipes, etc on different kitchenette backgrounds, which include yellow plastic, mauve curtains, green linoleum,straight out of an ill kept 60's trailer home.The pictures of the food are worse- dark brown fake cookies, shocking pink frosting,and so on. I liked Dave's books. This leaves me mystified and a little revolted. Plus, can't give it away to the library- has some egregious and R rated tips on cleaning one's privates, getting money off drunk men, etc. Don't buy it."
5,You Almost Can't Take Her Seriously!,"Okay, so I will admit that if I wasn't aware that Sedaris ran an acclaimed cupcake company in NYC, I'd probably think the recipes in here would be jokes. Except the fact that when you look at them...they look right. And I promise you...that cupcake recipe....is AWESOME. Delicious.The entertaining information and tips are presented in the best manner ever. Sedaris enwtines horribly innappropriate jokes about alcoholics, old people, and personal hygiene with delicious and accurate recipes and decorating tips.The drawing that accompanies the blurb about cleaning your vagina is one of the funniest I have ever seen in my life.I don't recommend trying to sell your junk to your houseguests, but I DO recommend these recipes. Thumbs WAY up!"
1,Waste of Money,"Comes across as lamely stupid...kind of like a drunk telling jokes. Maybe I needed to be ""under the influence"" to find the humor in it. A waste of money."
5,A funny thing on Page 139,"There's a drawing on Page 139 that looks oddly like Congresswoman Sherri Davis of California.. and as a member of her congressional district, I find it creepy and mildly disrespectful... but sorta funny too."
4,Great For Camping,"These speakers are really great! The reason for my rating of 4 stars instead of all 5 is that, the only thing I find that needs a bit of improvement are the bottom of the feet of the penguins. If the feet were a bit more flat with a plastic surface perhaps installed inside the feet it would give them a more of a stable way of letting them stand up straight and not fall at times, Other than that these are really great to hook up to your PSP or other electronic device to hear the sounds from the devices. Sound quality is great! We bring these with us during our camping trips and hook them up to our PSP and watch movies."
3,"Not bad for wet razors, but.....","I tried the Billy Jealousy shave product with my Panasonic Wet/Dry razor and it was ok. I found a product from Real Shaving Company that works great. And it costs less than half of the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane product. Amazon carries a limited product line of Real Shaving Company products, but they are currently unavailable. I can find them at my local Rite-Aid Pharmacy. They do not however have them on the Rite Aid website. The only online stores are in the UK. Hopefully, Amazon will carry this item."
1,Not worth the money!,"I agree with all of the other 1 and 2 star reviews here. This stuff is sticky/gooey as hell, clogs your razor, dries out if you take more than 30 seconds to shave, and simply does not work any better than Edge gel. Honestly I would not buy this product if it was $4 per bottle, let alone $14."
4,Hydroplane Shave Cream,I use with a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and I shave in the shower. I have gotten very good results with this product. It is a bit pricey which is why I gave it 4 stars.
1,VERY POOR QUALITY DVD!!!,"I loved this 60's italian film, but... in my opinion, in this DVD the image's quality is very very poor. Really is shameful. My rate is not 1, is: 0."
2,a better version available elsewhere,"This film is available on dvd from more than one company. This ""Saturday Matinee"" edition is missing approximately fifteen minutes, its visually quality is poorer, and the subtitles are less well done. The ""No Shame"" edition comes as a box set of two Valerio Zurlini films (the other is ""Violent Summer,"" 1959)and contains several important scenes lacking in the ""Saturday Matinee"" edition."
3,"Check it out y'all, strictly 4 tha south and str8 bout it!","Not Bad at all, its worth checking out. It is not so original, but it does contains the same formula a lot of south uses to keep selling records after records. Check it out, the few tracks that I love I have been playing them over and over. South Memphis, North Memphis in full effect"
1,well....at least they tried,"This album [stinks]. I beg you not to waste your money. The old saying ""its the thought that counts"" applies to this one. Im sure that if the singers COULD think(and sing), it wouldve been much better. the song selection was wonderful, i will admit, but the mixing and voiceover on the tracks was terrible."
5,Freud 99-009 Router Bit,Freud does make the best cutters however this bit is not the Quadra-Cut bit as shown. According to Freud's website it is not offered as a Quadra-Cut.
4,Hard and effective workout,"This workout is more intense then the other release. I did find myself watching the clock while getting the moves in and doing the work. The instructor is good but not my favorite. I like the format and found the moves to be advanced on some of the moves. This is a great workout for someone trying to boost the metabolism and get it reving, not my favorite but one I will do again."
3,Not bad,This is a great workout for burning calories. The cardio portion usesstrength training techniques and really feels like it is working. Itsgoal is to increase endurance and raise the metabolism and the DVD alsocomes with a Meal Plan that includes helpful recipes and healthy snacks.I'd recommend this DVD for semi-experienced exercisers.
5,Great workout,"I bought this workout video because it was recommended by fitness magazine. It was worth every penny. The workout is just under an hour and perfect for any day of the week. My heart rate monitor likes this video a lot. I combines great cardio with strength. The host is kinda funny but it keeps you going through the whole thing. Plus, no tedious ab routines."
2,"Stephen King, or Clive Barker he AIN'T...","This collection of stories was a disappointment. I was hoping for suspense, build-ups, plot twists and suprise endings, but no. VERY predictable and not clever, at all! The punch line is almost ALWAYS on the opening few pages of the stories.It reads like he was making it up as he was going along. If only his writing were a good as his looks."
4,Similar to Sequoia NP book,I was well pleased with the trail and park information in both this and the King's Canyon Hikers Guides but I found a lot of duplication of information between the two. Disappointed that the author didn't just write a single tome.
3,They Play The Album Electric,"In contrast to the previous Weather report album - land mark ""Heavy Weather"" - this album is much more synthesized. In fact, many songs are bogged down with too much synth. Granted, ""Feathered Hat"" is an excellent track, as is ""Punk Jazz"". Those songs are choice Weather Report, but the others seem like a new wave jazz experiment that works some half of the time, and falls flat on it's face the other half. Only die hard Weather Report fans will find this a necessity as a whole."
3,I like this one!,"First of all: the infamous 'disco track', Jaco's ""River People"" is an amazing song, and way of ahead of its time - I would call it a predecessor to Deep House, Nu-Jazz or what have you.This is the infamous LP that got a one-star review from Down Beat. Personally, it's one of my favorites, and has great WR songs such as Zawinul's ""Young And Fine"". However, in the WR discography I'd rate it as ""average"", after gems like Black Market, Mysterious Traveller and Heavy Weather (which, by the way, I consider one of their weaker efforts)"
5,Companion video to new Vandross Hits CD...,"This tape has the videos from the beginning and to his ""Power of Love"" days--nice ""in studio"" filming of ""The Rush"" and the remake of ""A House Is Not A Home""...like I said on another review, ""There's Never Too Much Vandross""...these vids are as classic as the tunes...standout videos are ""Don't Want to Be a Fool"" and ""Here and Now""..."
5,A place of Joy,"Any ""Best of.."" recording gives the audience a chance to look at the growth of the artiste. ""The Best of Luther Vandross"" does just that! If it is possible to be consistently superior and yet get better, then Mr. Vandross clearly has only gotten better over the years (not to mention the fact that he looks better!). From the kid on the big truck singing ""Stop to Love"" to the classy mature man singing ""A House is not a Home"", I remain transfixed. One day, I will actually go to a Luther Vandross concert...."
1,one of thr poorest eastern europien POP SAMPLER,Just 100 % trash. The eastern europien corporate-music trash...
2,Boring,"Art has always had a very difficult time choosing quality songs for his great voice and this album is no exception. Most of these songs are BAD! Watermark has no great songs (most of Art's albums have at least 1 or 2) and a couple of ok songs (Crying in My Sleep, Saturday Suit, All My Love's Laughter) but the rest are very forgettable and VERY boring. That is the risk you take with singing all Jummy Webb tunes -- they are usually very boring in general with little melody to differentiate any of them. And I always thought the version of Wonderful World here (the only non-Jimmy Webb tune) was HORRIBLE! His rendition of She Moves Through the Fair is TERRIBLE too!! Get ""Breakaway"" first, and then if you like that pick up Fate for Breakfast or a Best of collection -- ""Garfunkel"" or ""Simply the Best"" (Import) are the best choices available. His new collection ""The Singer"" has way way way too many poor selections and drags. Better yet get a Simon & Garfunkel album!"
4,FALLING ON A MAYFIELD,"If u like deep poetic lyrics,alternative rock sound and a little malincony,well get this cd.I'm from Rome and in Italy no one knows this kind of band.If u like Jeff Buckley u'll like them too,the way of singing is similar to him."
5,Wow. Musical depth and an ability to rock.,"I saw these guys on Sunday as an opening band. I thought they were good, and bought the CD. If I had only known about them sooner, so I could have been enjoying longer! Neat, introspective lyrics. Guitars that work together, and with the emotional, gripping voice. If you wish Jeff Buckley was still alive, if you wish Ben Fold's Five could really rock, if you wish Mansun wasn't so poppy, then buy this album. (And all of this from Spokane, Washington? What, did they try to go to Seattle, and just miss? I don't care, they sound great!)"
1,Critical design weaknesses,"Like a previous reviewer, my initial impression was that these were well made. Upon closer examination though, I found that the slides are solidly built but the design of the mounting rail is very flimsy. There are two tiny tabs that hold the entire weight of the drawer and slide to the mounting rail. My slides are the 22"" model. The first pair I installed (replacing the slides in a pantry cabinet) immediately bent the tab and collapsed. I too am now in the midst of figuring out how to modify the mounting mechanism to be able to use the other four pair of slides I had bought for this cabinet. They might work if I turn the slides upside down and swap the left and right sides. That would put the mounting rail underneath the slide so that there is much more support area, not just the suppport of the tiny tabs."
5,the best sheets i have ever purchased!,"these sheets are wonderful! good quality and a great price. even my husband thinks so, and believe me, that's saying something!"
1,The reviews must be rigged - DON'T BUY THESE SHEETS!,"These sheets are supposed to be so soft, but I have purchased this threadcount before from others and these sheets are rough and noisy. The only good thing about these sheets is that they do have a deep pocket enough to fit a mattress and 4 inch memory foam topper. I read the reviews and figured I was getting a great deal...but I got screwed."
3,Unsatisfied,"I purchased the California King size set for my tempurpedic mattress. Not worth the $120.00 I paid for the set. They stay on better than any other sheets I've purchased so far, but they pop off every couple of days. That is super irritating since my mattress weighs a ton! They're also not a soft as I'd hoped. I would not purchase these sheets again."
4,Pontoon post guide on,The installation was seamless and the kit contained all of the parts needed to complete. After installation the pontoon was guided on even in rough water. Much safer!
1,What about the Jews of old Jerusalem?,"According to the Ottomon censuses, Jews made up the majority of Jerusalem residents in the 18th and 19th centuries. My family was part of the Morrocan Jewish community of Jerusalem, which dates back to the middle ages. This community was afflicted with discrimination, poverty and disease, but, in spite of everything survived intact until 1948. After the Jordanian takeover in the Israeli War of Independance, this community was driven out. The ancient synagogues were looted and destroyed, or occupied by squatters, as were the houses of the Jewish refugees. Jewish graves on the Mount of Olives were destroyed, the tombstones used to build roads and houses.Why is there no mention of of that important history in this book? Why is it invisible? Why do that disservice to a readership deserving of the whole story?"
3,don't take this book too seriously,"I received this book as a high school graduation present a few years back and was slightly disappointed. I liked that this book focuses on girls, since we have different apprehensions before college and different needs once we get there. But there was some advice in the book that a girl should not listen to (i.e. the book says to dump your high school boyfriend before going to college), which should be based on personal feelings and beliefs."
4,Amazon-Produced CD-R,"Great soundtrack, but customers should be aware that this is currently a CD-R duplicate of the original disc, with a CD booklet and insert reproduced from a scan. The bar code says, ""Manufactured by Amazon.com"". On the one hand, you can get an out-of-print disc. On the other hand, you are NOT getting an actual original CD. CD-Rs don't play on old equipment, and they can degrade in a few years. It would be nice if Amazon indicated that they were selling a home-made reproduction of the original disc. I recommend saving a few bucks by buying the MP3 version, and burning your own CD-R."
5,The Martindale: a conditio sine qua non,"For everyone in the health profession The Martindale is a book they need to have. You find all the relevant information about drugs and other usefull substances. Besides this it is very clearly written with no fuss, just the information you need."
4,the face of appalachia,"this book was so good it made me want to be a dirt poor mountain man in the face of appalachia. i wanted to cut ice from the river in the winter and play the harpsichord or the violachord on the front porch with the girls in the faded ginko sun dresses. i wanted to pick up a fiddle and walk with june carter cash over mountain ranges to refight the war to suppress yankee arrogance. the only thing i knew about the carter family before was rosanne cash and kings road record shop. but now i wish i could hear maybelle, ap and sara in the recordings from bristol, tenn. and i wonder if there are any shacks in appalachia with cable TV."
4,An END justified. The MEANS catasrophic.,"Fighting fire with fire. An effective tactic in a forest. Light a controlled fire to remove the fuel ahead of a raging conflagration. But should one really advocate the protection of the global environment by creating a global catastrophe? By creating a STATE OF FEAR?Innocent, well-meaning, unwitting lambs are placed on the environmental sacrificial altar. Those high-minded high priests of the greater global good plan to fuel the flames of public awareness. God may create catastrophes in his own good time, but these high priests have their own schedule. Their own agenda.All the world is but a stage for the late Michael Crichton in this revelatory book about militant environmentalist. The environmental high priest watches the last gasps of a no longer useful scientist and possibly thinks, ""It is a far far better thing I do (to you)...""Reviewed by Charles Dusenbury, author MOLASBA and COMPUTER BREAIN, on Kindle."
3,Not the best,"Do not read much fiction (prefer non-fiction) but a co-worker gave me this book after he had finished with it. I found the character build up, style, etc. kind of sophomoric, very cliché. All in all a bit disappointed but it is small bit of help in balancing out the overkill of ""global warming"" hysteria. I would give it 2 stars but will up it to 3 just for the fact that the book riles the birkenstock/granola, junk science crowd."
3,yes but no,I found the read enjoyable but at times to preachy. I understand the need to make a point though it seems at times that overstatement was the norm instead of the exception. Good story and enjoyed the Indiana Jones on steroids character. I always thought that when one presented an idea in a book such as this one was supposed to take a stand and not say that he has no opinion that he cares to state to the reader. Thanks for the teaching professor but next time pick a side and don't straddle the fence.
1,Same as it ever was,Crichton handles the subject matter the way you would expect and the same way he has treated science in his past books: hamfistedly. Shame on Crichton for presenting what should be a valid scientific argument the way a 12-year-old on a playground would. Pop novelists shouldn't presume to be scientists and vice versa. It feels like like he read all about global warming in an in-flight magazine article written by Rush Limbaugh.
1,The most boring book of the year,"A friend gave me this ""book"" exictedly yesterday. Said ""It's the most important book of the year!""I'd argue it's the most boring.Danielle Steel has more life to her writing. Jackie Collins has more grace!I have no idea why this book is supposed to be ""important."" But it is bad, it is very, very bad.From the book jacket, Crichton's quite popular as the writer of bad movies. Junk and trash sell. No real surprise.But do your friends a favor and don't gift them with this book.Save it for your enemies."
1,A boring ride on Crichton's hobbyhorse,"This novel is about 600 pp in length - perhaps 450 pp too long since a lot of it is taken up with Crichton's eclectic compilation of ""data"" purporting to show that global warming & climate change don't exist. The plot is based on the premise that global warming & climate change don't exist but their effects -- e.g., glaciers melting & calving or unseasonal floods in the desert SW -- are actually caused by eco-terrorists who stand to gain financially from a public that believes in these phenomena. When the characters appear, in between the reams of spurious data, they are barely two-dimensional and move through improbable sometimes silly adventures in trying to best the eco-terrorists. The library is your friend here - don't waste a cent on this book."
2,reads too much like a screenplay,"the plot is mediocre at best. remember when mc use to write intelligent books that were also entertaining. wow. that was a long time ago. now the books seem so formulaic.this book reads like a screenplay. i mean you can almost hear the audience laughing at the cheap silly parts put in. its no novel just a screenplay for mc's next bomb of a movie.i realize that its difficult to write quality novel after novel but i think that mc should take a risk. write something good that read like a novel not a hollywood movie. honestly this book is junk. sorry, but i have read all mc's books."
1,"Half thriller, half ""global warming doesn't exist"" = a mediocre book","This book has the makings of a great thriller but there are dozens and dozens of pages where characters blather endlessly about global warming facts, statistics, and bad science. For me, it became unreadable and I never finished the book. A rare act by a fan of Crichton's other works."
2,What happened to Michael Crichton?,"I read this long book over a couple days this past spring. I read through the whole book and was really disappointed by the end. My hope is that Michael Crichton turns around and renews his great novel writing of the past. ""State of Fear"" did have a sometimes fast-paced story, but the author's personal politics in regard to the legitimacy of global warming was overwhelming and simply too heavy-handed. For those readers who love conspiracy theory and for those who do not value the current warnings by the scientific community concerning global warming, this book will be a great addition to your library. If, however, you have been a Crichton fan in the past with his wonderful science-flavored novels like ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Jurrasic Park"", don't purchase this book--it's the first failure that this great author has produced. I'll have to be a bit more discerning as to which future Crichton novels I buy."
5,Thrilling!!!,"This book is awesome! I love his references REAL studies and shows how politics the media tries to keep us in a STATE OF FEAR and only use the parts of the studies that suite thier agenda! Love it, Love it, Love it. If you know any die hard tree huggers give them a copy of this book."
3,Decent at Best,This book was decent. Not the best i have read but it was OK. The book had a very slow start and the plot took forever to build and then once it did open up it was all over the place. I enjoyed the book but probably would not recommend it to others.
2,Can you believe the science when the proofread is so bad?,"My comment about this book is possibly regarding an editorial error, however -- when someone wants to debunk science that is so unanimously interpreted as correct (i.e. - global warming is an unfolding reality) -- they should probably get all the mundane facts straight.Example: Pismo Beach, California is not north of San Francisco, California."
1,This is a seriously bad story,"Forget it. All you one-star ratings hit the nail on the head. This is a terrible novel. Man, I skipped whole chapters sometimes. I didn't want any re-education on global warming issues. I wanted an entertaining story to relax with. In the end, I couldn't finish it, and have it up for resale at EBAY! Maybe Ill get some of my poorly spent cash back? Dont waste your money on this book."
1,an empty vessel of talent,"let's remember ""congo"". the man tells a good tale about nothing, and like congo this wasn't even a good tale."
1,"an intelligent rebuttal to Crichton's ""science"" in this book",I would urge people who take Crichton's word as the gospel on global warming to read at least one intelligent response to his claims in this fictional work. There are many. You can find one at http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=74 .
2,Disappointed,"Chriton comes across as preachy, patronizing and condescending in this book. He has a political viewpoint to push, and he pushes it hard, losing his audience in the process. The data he uses to support his viewpoint is mostly outdated. He is basically telling his audience that if they believe global warming to be real, they are uneducated fools and he has the data to prove it.Let's not forget that Chriton is an MD, not a climatologist. His take on global warming is no more relevant than that of any other educated person who reads journals and compilations of data: It's an opinion. If he were a climatologist, I'd take him more seriously.I wish I had not bought this book."
5,Just No Good,"This book sucked. I should buy it.Leave vote that my review was helpful.Signed,Erica Phillips(Look me a long time to write this review, the least you can do is vote that my review was helpful. Thanks and have a great day, with love from Decatur!)"
2,"Interesting data, poor story","I have enjoyed Dr. Crichton's books in the past, and I REALLY wanted to enjoy this one. I believe the environmental movement has largely fallen into three camps: the sincere, the hysterical, and the big business. Unfortunately, it seems the first camp is fewest in number. The science put forth in this book was truly thought provoking. Unfortunately, I had to sit through the rest of the book to hear it. There were incredibly odd moments, like being attacked by hooded men and then going for a walk with the woman who chased off the assailants.The appendix at the end of the book might have been the best part. I wish Dr. Crichton would just bind and release his research for this novel as a meaty paper."
2,State of Fear,"An interesting book, typical of the author, but, in this case, with a distinct point of view, basically antiglobal warming theories. He makes a distinction between ""good"" and ""bad"" science. However, the data that support his main theory has been recently proven wrong due to faulty mechanics (instruments providing incorrect input). What is clear is that 10000 years ago, or even 1 million years ago, there were not 5 billion people on the planet, especially those who drive a big ass car/truck 2 miles to get a doughnut..there also appears to be a few more hurricanes than normal.. Lets leave science to the scientists."
1,Disappointing - a poor novel as well as a lost opportunity.,"State of Fear was very disappointing. Crichton had some important points to make regarding global warming, and he tries to illustrate them by means of a wild tale of adventure and intrigue, but the novel is so poorly written that it's unlikely that many people will think seriously about the issues that he raises. The character development has the depth of a Superman Comic Book, and the plot line is just about as believable.Having some professional experience in related fields, I happen to share his opinion that the public policy discussions regarding global warming have so far failed to adequately reflect our current state of scientific knowledge. Because of this, I'm particularly saddened that he lost the opportunity to contribute to the debate by producing such a shockingly poor novel."
1,Take a pass on this one,"A disjointed anti-environmental rant. With the riviting plot line of a porno movie, Chichton strings together a series of unrelated events to keep you reading what essentially is his thesis disproving global warming complete with graphs and footnotes to source material. If you care about this novelist's scientific opinion, skip the ""novel"" and proceed directly to the appendix, where he tells you ""what he really thinks.""I would say save this for video, but there is not enough story here for even that."
1,Bland and Didactic,"I have never read a book by Michael Crichton. I have heard that his books tend to be hit or miss. Well, this was a tremendous miss. In the authors comments he admits that the book's subject was a pet cause for him. He goes off on numerous unnecessary tangents in nearly every chapter. There is very little action, and you never identify with the characters. Kenner is the only character with any redeeming qualities, and he is an arrogant jackass.State of Fear is a waste of your time. 99% of the book is build up, and it never pays off. The villains are not vanquished, nor are they even punished. There is no resolution to this story, and after all the lecturing Crichton does, readers deserve better. Pick up The Talisman by Stephen King. It is a much more satisfying read, with many of the same moral undertones.I am not sure I will read another book by Crichton. Perhaps I will pick up Jurassic Park, just to see if that book lives up to his reputation as a best selling author."
2,Lousy Audio Presentation,"The story might have been decent but I couldn't get past George Wilson's atrocious narration. Although he is able to express different characters' dialog in different tones of voice, he mostly drones in a horrible monotone. Additionally, I think he flunked out of William Shatner's School of Dramatic Pause as he occasionally waits two or three seconds (maybe longer) between words, often in the same sentence.I returned this on to the library mid-way through the second disk."
4,state of fear review,"not his best, a little slow at the beggining but a good payoff. Not as good as Timeline or jurassic park, but i enjoyed it. As always there is lots of interesting scientific ideas and theories thrown about. a good book, not his best, but still an exciting read."
2,Talky and disappointing,"This could have been a good 150-page thriller. Most of Crichton's novels have a nice dose of intellectual stimulation, but this is basically a political broadside with occasional lapses into exciting action. Characters become points of view, dialogue degenerates into speeches... Make it 2 parts action to 1 part discourse and I could hang in there, but by the 17th extended lecture making EXACTLY the same point in virtually the same language and phrasing (with line graphs!), I had to close the book. From the writer who gave us Rising Sun and Jurassic Park, this is a disappointment."
2,Hard to let down Chricton drowned in statistics and preaching,"This novel is a typical ""hard to let down"" Chricton novel. There's a lot of action and intrigue, but I found most of the intrigue quite predictable.About the global warming conspiracy preaching in this novel it really makes you wonder. Drowning the reader in statistics do not hide the fact that Chricton resorts to the same techniques he accuses his characters by carefully selecting information that adheres to his points and forgetting what's damageable to his views."
1,Major disappointment,"I have enjoyed all of Crichton's books in the past, but this was a real departure. I found this alleged ""novel"" to be little more than a moralistic lecture on Crichton's views of the evils of global warming advocates. The plot was absurd. Only if you enjoy moralizing in your novels AND you believe warnings of global warming are overblown, might you enjoy this. I was amazed at how many words the author wasted lecturing us, as well as the one-dimensional characters (all advocates of global warming are depicted as evildoers, fools, or both). On top of this, the audio version was terrible. The reading was melodramatic and the reader used a soft ""feminine?"" voice for the female characters, even when they were angry, excited, etc. Poor marks all around, unless you are looking for a diatribe against global warming (in which case, buy the book, not the audio)."
1,Don't waste your time with this book,I could not get past the first 40 pages. This book is BORING as well as completely lacking in accuracy.
3,Interesting View Point,"I think Crichton does a good job of stacking up the ""evidence"" for (or rather in this case against) global warming. The book flows well, but now and again becomes a little too much like a distance learning course on global warming impacts. The story is compelling (as a good Crichton book is) -- but it starts to stray a little too ""clinical"" and forsakes some of the action. If you read a book like Secret Revelation by Steve Bell, it manages to get some pretty juicy facts in but the story line doesn't derail o get you there. In all a good read (but buy the paperback) I have wrist injuries from holding the hard back version!!!"
5,Good read.,"Lots of detail. Good follow-up in the Appendix. Some parts are disturbing (cannibalism), but overall it's entertaining."
4,Good fun with global warming,"A fun, action filled (though at times, highly preposterous) action story. But the real fun is in the detailed research Chrichton did for this book. (Be sure to read the endnotes - there is a great anecdote about the ""dangers of dyhydrogen monoxide."")This story is about how the media and our politicians have been taken hostage by highly motivated interest groups, and the dangers of group think. Is global warming real? Who knows, but we can never have a real debate about it.Some people have had violent reactions to the mere mention of this book, probably because they haven't read it. So be brave! Dare to be different! Highly recommended. A great airplane book. Of course, it will probably anger your seat mates, but so what?"
3,"Lecture on the other side of global warming debate, lightly veiled as novel.","Good read b/c it shows the little promoted, ""other"" side of global warming debate. I found the statistics & research interesting & compelling, but now take both the ""pro"" & ""con"" sides of this issue w/a heavy grain of salt. W/both sides being so vehement about their stances, the wisest approach is to educate oneself & weigh the sea of facts & statistics repeatedly (much like the story's characters suggest at the end of the story). As a novel, it was very light. Engaging, no. Informative, very. Far from Crichton's best work. Worth reading if for no other reason than to open your mind to the lesser promoted side of global warming."
1,Both fiction AND misinformed propaganda,"I have to assume the author of State of Fear didn't have the courage to present his propaganda as ""non-fiction"", but then he clearly must know that it IS fiction, and not believable. If you really want to know the truth about global warming, read Joseph Romm's new book, ""Hell and High Water"".Romm has his facts straight, but Crichton is right about one thing, the truth is scary and it SHOULD make us all fearful...fearful about what we've done and are doing to future generations, around the world."
1,Propaganda,"I purchsed this book thinking that it was another formulaic Crichton thriller which I enjoy. Turns out that it was nothing more than a vehicle to promote the anti-global warming views of Mr. Crichton. The views were so favorable to the current Republican administration, Mr. Crichton was invited to meet with Mr. Bush to discuss this serious matter better left in the hands of real scientists not novelists, even with an M.D."
4,Typical great book from Crichton,"I read this right after reading Next and it brought me back to the typical thriller I expect from Chricton. Great read!Michael T. Hanley, CPA is the Managing Partner of the Smithtown, NY CPA Firm, Merl & Hanley, LLP and the author of Effective Tax Planning for the MicroBusiness: 30 Minutes With...A Certified Public Accountant: Effective Tax Planning for the MicroBusiness"
4,State of Fear reviewed,"Do you recall the hype of all that made you nervous like El Nino, Anthrax, Bird Flu and Y2K? Read this book and it can explain the latest wave of created fear, Global warming? I have not been a big believer in this ""theory"" This book explains why better then any one persons opinion, if you have doubts then read the book and take it for what it's worth, nothing will change if you don't, you'll just have a better insight of what we have been exposed to.Very well researched and written books with good data but read and decide for yourself."
5,The other side of the enviromental movement...,"People have critisized the author for not making an ""original"" arguement in this book. So what? By his own admission, he's not an enviromental scientist, but he did do the research, and he did have his facts in order. So who cares if he is only a novelist? Focus on the message, and not messenger. If in the end you can't do that, well, it's fiction. Remember?"
3,One of Crichton's Weakest Books!,"Michael Crichton is usually an excellent writer, however, he totally missed the mark with this one. A thriller about global warming and the different factions trying to prove/disprove that it is happening. It is extremely difficult to follow and has a lot of dead space that makes it drag along painfully.I would suggest getting Jurrasic Park or Congo instead of this mishmash!"
1,Ghost written by Bush administration???,"I have liked Crichton's previous books but this one was a major disappointment and extremely irritating, since I consider myself a person who cares deeply about the environment. The further I got into the story, the more obvious Crichton's conservative political agenda became. I kept trying to remind myself that it was only a story but the insulting, thinly-disguised references to Martin Sheen (environmental activist actor who plays the president on television -- let me guess who he means) infuriated me and I couldn't continue reading it. The story isn't even very interesting. This is not the same skill exhibited in 'Prey' or 'Timeline'. It's obvious this book was written for a reason -- to try and deny that global warming exists and to demonize the environmentalists who are trying to preserve existing clean air and water protections. I think I could be considered a former fan of Crichton."
1,Unbelievable crap,"In a nutshell, this one sucked. I just cannot wait for his next misguided verbal diarrhea defending our honourable war on terror."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read,"Was this book an elaborate joke? Was this book ghostwritten by Dick Cheney? Almost every character is an offensive shallow stereotype of those ""wacko liberals"" that are just straw men waiting to be knocked down by the cool, paramilitary ""genius"". Every couple pages he goes into a lecture about how those ""do-gooders"" don't know what they are talking about, how global warming is a myth and no one can back it up with science, and/or how the corrupt environmental organizations are just preaching chicken little nonsense to raise money or control the population... or something along those lines. It's really awful. The plot is awful, the science is awful, the characters are awful, the logic used to ""debunk"" global warming is awful. This book is insultingly stupid.To paraphrase a famous quote: If you can't convince them of your brilliance, baffle them with bull****. This book is the latter."
4,Beware of Doom Sayers,"I listened to the novel on cassette while I was on the road. It was one of those tapes that never got dull. I thoroughly enjoyed the explanation of the science in the debate over global warming. I was reminded of the similar issue that arises in the social sciences called ""Moral Panics."" Some of the characters were not entirely believable, but, it was a ripping good story.I also enjoyed the author's social commentary at the end of the novel."
2,full of propaganda and name dropping,The story is mildly entertaining but the name dropping and propaganda has to go. Not the type of thing I would expect from the writer of such groundbreaking and interesting novels.
1,Worst Crichton ever,"I love Michael Crichton, but hate this book. The characters were fake, the story was confusing, and I got tired of the preaching."
3,Cliche,"Cliche. I am a strong fan of Michael Crichton and have read all of his published books. I never have paid any attention to Global Warming throughout my life, and would consider myself unbiased on the matter.With that said, I am biased on reviewing this book, and not on his global warming topic. The book is one huge cliche. It seems that M.C. read Da Vinici Code, and wanted to make a ""better"" and ""bigger"" and more mainstream of a novel, and he did. Entertaining, quick and easy read, but pretty shallow and lacking in uniquness.HOWEVER, the essay he includes in the appendix of this book is valid and is something everyone who is interested in Global Warming and/or Michael Crichton should most definatly read."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"BORING! Annoying pseudo-analysis sections that drag on and on and on throughout. For a piece of fiction, this book had an unbelievable plot, was slow as a slug and lack of good characterization.Recommend not wasting your time or money with this."
4,State of fear,"Very eye opening and makes one think. Read the book with an open mind. When finished, take action if care about our planet...please!"
3,Less a thriller than a one-sided argument,"Several of the other reviewers hit it right on the head so I'll only add that, once I realized, a few chapters in, that this book was going to be a thinly veiled argument against global warming, I started to resent being manipulated.The early action/adventure scenes were somewhat suspenseful, but later on there was far too much dialog by a condescending, know-it-all character, trying to belittle other characters' support of the concept of global warming with supposed facts (all footnoted). Some of Crichton's arguments did make me think, which I suppose was his goal, but it wasn't mine when I picked up the book.Since the heads of all 12 of the world's National Academies of Science agree on global warming, it's hard to dismiss it as quickly as Crichton would like us to."
3,Lecture tied around loose plot,"When I first read ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand, I was thrilled. It was, of course, a lesson in Politics in the guise of a novel. But lately, more and more novelists have gone down this path, and it's tiresome. Barbara Kingsolver irritated me with Prodigal Summer, because it was just a platform for her characters to muse on protection of wildlife.Now comes Crichton, who uses a ""plot"" about world destruction to lecture about fear monging.I gave it 3 stars, and not less, because the content was thought provocative and worthwhile. But I would have been happier if he wrote it as non-fiction, instead of trying to build a plot around his agenda."
2,Not his best,"While the core concept of this book is interesting and compelling. The story is nothing special. The characters are lame, and the plot twists are fairly stupid -- ranging from predictable to patently ridiculous.I wish I could send it back to Crichton and ask, ""try again... same concept, new characters, new plot.""All in all, Crichton's epilogue was the most compelling read. It's worth checking out just for that."
2,Where's the Story,"I found the book interesting to read, provocative with the give and take regarding positions, opinions, and research on environmental issues,the media, industry, etc; but almost entirely lacking as a story/novel/suspense thriller. It felt like the plot was inserted so that the author could expound on his thoughts about the environmental movement, its detractors, the use of the media, etc.in a format that his reading public would accept, e.g. how many people would read a serious non-fiction discussion of these issues even with the Crichton name attached? Most of the ""suspense"" was telegraphed, the story was simply a chase from one outlandish situation to another, and the characters were more archtypes than real people.Overall, the book was interesting to read because of the issues raised, but very disappointing as a suspense/novel."
2,State of Fear,"The book is too wordy; a 1/3 or more could have been edited out. I almost decided not to finish it, the first part read like a soap opera. The last 1/6 of the book is good, but it's obvious the author is preaching about the media, politics, and the environment. I would not recommend it."
3,POLITICAL AGENDA DRAGS BOOK,"First of all I am a Michael Crichton fan. I've read most of hisworks but I wished I'd skipped this. He's off his game. The book is heavy with his political agenda and it suffers.Skip this one and read Congo instead - his earlier books are better than those of the last five years. From Timeline onit's as if he lost his muse. The magic is missing.It would seem that State of Fear was well researched but it's just not as gripping as Lost World, Congo, Disclosure, etc.I imagine he's been run over by divorce lawyers and he needs a real break. Sorry, but read CONGO - it's on my list of best books written because of the excitement and well fleshed out characters."
3,"Enjoyable, but not my favorite","I am a fan of MC and I always enjoy reading his books. This one is typical of his writing style. It contains a lot of scientific data and brings to light some very interesting arguments about science and how we apply it to solve problems.In this story a group of environmental terrorists want to cause some disasters around the world to raise awareness and funding of environmental causes. Try not to get too caught up in the political arguments in the book unless you really like arguing.I gave it 3 stars. It was a little slow getting into the story. I think it was about 60 pages into the book before I was able to figure out who the protagonist was because it jumped around so much. Most of the characters were kind of shallow and not developed as well as I thought they could have been. Even so, I enjoyed reading it."
2,A very disappointing book,"I have been a great fan of Michael Crichton but of all his books,this one has really disappointed me.It looks like he hastily thought of some plot so that he could give lengthy preachings and include unnecessary discussions on weather ,environment and global warming.The book starts well and Crichton manages to get the reader interested when John Kenner meets with George Morton and later with the suspense surrounding the death of Morton but the plot keeps getting interrupted by lengthy and often boring discussions and graphs about the environment and Carbon Dioxide levels.The plot ultimately gets too predictable and a bit childish.Most of us who are great fans of Mr Crichton are used to his style of putting discussions and preachings in his work but this one is a bit too much.I eagerly await his next book and hope that he will once again write something on the lines of his other great books like Sphere,Prey,Airframe,Timeline or Jurassic Park."
2,A lot of preaching,"No story. A lot of preaching. I was getting really tired of the Kenner guy telling everyone he met how to they should think...Whether you agree with Crichton's view of global warming or not...give me a story, not a book with a lot of footnotes. One more thing...where was ending?"
1,A 300-page lecture,"News flash for those who haven't read this book -- Michael Crichton doesn't believe in global warming. And, he makes it clear that he thinks anyone who does believe in it, has fallen `Prey' to media hype and unsound science. He compares concern over global warming to the hype about killer bees and Y2K. Yes, the media loves to scare us, but somehow I don't think the public is quite as gullible as Crichton makes us out to be. I generally love Crichton's books, but this time he has climbed onto a soap box and presented a 300-page, one-sided lecture and I for one wish I hadn't bought the book."
5,Entertaining AND Educational,"I loved this book! It was packed full of action, which kept me entertained, but there was also a lot of information about global warming and climate change. Like many other Michael Chrichton books, this one made me think about issues in new ways and from different perspectives. I especially appreciated his research notes in the back of the book."
2,Very disappointed Catholic Mom,"I bought this book with high hopes because of various reviews I had read about it. The activities and recipes are not very creative at all, I could scare up better ones for free with a google search of catholic Mommy blogs. Plus, one of the featured activities is celebrating a Jewish passover seder, which St. Thomas Aquinas says is not morally licit for Catholics. I gave it two stars because I could see some parts of the book being okay if you just didn't know where to get started or Internet research overwhelms you. But I think that the book isn't worth the money and is disappointing."
5,There and back and there again,"I bought this album on vinyl in the eighties and I was fully into guitar oriented rock. Nowadays I like all kinds of music, but Jeff Beck is here to stay. There are a few albums that stand the time, and There and Back is one of these. It's still original, it has that pure Beck sound, good compositions, nice arrangements. I love The pump, it's one of the best songs I ever heard! Excellent composition, and the song breaths that great atmosphere onlye Jeff Beck is able to create. If you want to go somewhere, go There and Back..."
5,A More Modern Sound.,"""There and Back"" is an excellent disc. On this 1980 release, there is a more modern sound than on Beck's late 60's and 70's material, naturally... If you like soulful & expressive electric guitar compositions, then you would really enjoy this disc. We shouldn't overlook Beck's bandmates, as there are playing at a very high level of proficiency and artistic expression as well. Get ""There and Back"" you will be glad you did. I've always enjoyed this release!"
3,Wordy follow-up to 1632,"Where 1632 was full of wonder, action and discovery, 1633 is much heavier into political discussion and heavy duty strategy. I did not like it nearly as much but the last third moves along at a good clip."
3,Much less than it appears.,"If you're looking for a continuation of the well written, fast paced 1632, you won't find it here. Weber and Flint wrote 1633 like they are being paid by the word. The entire 600 page book could have been done in about 50 pages if all the history monologs and biographies were condensed. If you're looking for more of the exploits of Julie Mackay, you won't find it here either. She's been sent to Scotland and plays essentially no role in the book. Rebecca, Jeff and Gretchen are stranded in Amsterdam. Melissa, Rita and Tom are stuck in the Tower of London (along with Cromwell) and don't do much either. And in the afterword we find that four more books are planned.One compliment I will pay is that I do like the fact that the history of this universe is diverging from that of our own.Otherwise, I hope that the following books have considerably more substance than this one does."
5,Buffalo Games Puzzles are well made,"Like all Buffalo Games Puzzles, this one is very well made. The pieces fit so well that you can pick up the entire puzzle when complete. There is considerable variety in piece shapes, although each piece (except edge pieces) connects with four neighbors. The cardboard is thicker and more durable than cheaper puzzles, but it wouldn't like getting wet or being chewed. This puzzle is moderately difficult because the art is low contrast. The art is very interesting. I worked it without looking at the picture and was continually surprised at what the various patterns and colors turned out to be. I have about 150 jigsaws of various brands and always have one in progress."
3,Not up to standard,"For me it was a good book, but not up to standard. Richard is getting a little too perfect for my liking. I struggled a little to finish and you need to be an addict to read this book. Hope the next one is better."
2,Shocked!!!,"I was really looking forward to this book coming out, until I was thru reading the second chapter! I then became very upset! It wasn't so much the story line that was so unimaginative it was that everything from book number five didn't carry over! There isn't a final meeting with Jagang or anything! There was plenty of characters that were left out of the book which shouldn't have been. I had to struggle through this whole book and I'm pretty disappointed with Goodkind's writing. It's like he threw this book together, trying to finish off a series that he wasn't ready to write. I would have preferred if he would have waited until he thought of something better! I've never seen a case of writers-block as bad as this one!"
3,"Good, but more of the same","Just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this installment in the series and that I enjoy Goodkind's writing very much. However, I must agree with other posters who feel that the storyline is becoming redundant with Richard and Kahlan being separated over and over. To be fair, though, I consider Goodkind to be a very talented writer whose writing style keeps me interested throughout his books. His characters are very admirable, and plotlines extremely realistic. During Richard's ""making"" by the Mord-Sith was almost as painful to read as they were to experience by Richard. I am a Jordan fan also, but in comparison, Goodkind's work is much more interesting to read, which goes to show that a good story can be a long one without being boring and over-complex. How much it is enjoyed is the mark of a good author."
1,Pointless Waste of Words,"After thoroughly enjoying the first few books of this series, I have been steadily disappointed as time has worn on. I debated whether or not to even buy this one, and unfortunately curiousity got the better of me. I read the first 200 pages, put the book down and have no desire to pick it up again. It's awful. The characters are predictable and annoying. The grace and wit of the writer is long gone. Too bad. Another good Fantasy series sunk by greed and burn out. That's it for me. I'll stick to reading Robin Hobb. At least she knows how to END a book."
4,A Resurrection,"Congratulations to Mr Goodkind! He took a series that was becoming rather pedestrian and resurrected it from the grave. After reading Faith of the Fallen, I felt the need to read all of the books of the series again!Unlike most other readers, I enjoy long series of books, as this is the way life is - it does not just end happily ever after, but other trials arise and that is what makes Goodkind's characters become a part of the readers' lives. The fight against oppresion that takes place in this book is inspiring and well thought out. The love and devotion expressed is realistic, not a fairy tale but true to life and humanity. Thank you to an author who has captured my interest and ensured that I will come back for more."
2,I felt like I have read this already,"Have you read any Ayn Rand? Terry Goodkind obviously has. In fact I was so turned off by the unsubtle pushing of capitalism in the beggining of the book that I almost stopped reading. Don't get me wrong, I love Ayn Rand, but If I had wanted to read a good old fashion communist bashing book I would have reread ""We the living"" or ""Atlas Shrugged"". Terry manages to keep the story (slowly) moving, but it is a far cry from the first book, which I couldn't put down. The main plot is basically the same one we have seen in the last five books. What happened to the origional story lines that I used to enjoy? I was hopeing that this book would prove my fears wrong, but it hasn't. The series is slowly dying. Sorry Terry, I think it is time to put the Sword of Truth to rest."
4,Not as good as Temple of the Winds,"This book started out cool with the hut in nature and everything. However, I think that Richard's part really declined after that. I really enjoyed Kahlan's battle with the Order, but when it got to Richard it got really slow. I don't think they should have put a picture of the statue on the cover! It didn't seem as magnificent as they made it out to be. I really enjoyed Temple of the Winds, and this was a good comeback after a dismal Soul of the Fire. I cannot afford book 7 in hardback so I await it in paperback."
5,Excellent,"I find it intruiging in each book to look for the explanation of the cover art. Just wait till you get to the part that explains what is on the cover of this one. Great story line, and very moving, too. Some people seem to think that Terry Goodkind's last couple of books are two ""different"" in style, but that just makes things more interesting! I think that whatever Goodkind has to say about the Sword of the Truth universe deserves attention. I stayed up till early in the morning reading it!"
3,"Good, but too preachy","If you've ever enjoyed an Ayn Rand novel, be prepared to like this book. It reads a lot like her's do. Terry Goodkind's series is slowly departing from its charming course of fantasy, into a text book on social science. It feels like the plot of the story is becoming secondary to its message. He does a good job of mixing philosophy with action, but I liked it much better when his main concern was for characters rather than morals. Don't get me wrong, its still a very readable book. I can't wait for the next one to come out. I just hope that we'll get to hear more about Richard, and less about the definitions of good and evil in his society."
2,"Same plot, yet again","This book isn't so much a novel as it is a manifesto on the evils of communism. If you want a 500 page lecture, go ahead and buy this book, but don't expect a whole lot of entertainment. Goodkind yet again recycles his tired plot: Richard is captured by an evil woman; Flawless hero, Richard, eventually prevails; Evil woman turns out to be good in the end; Richard and Kalahn are reunited; Everything works out for the best. For someone who spent 500 pages extolling the virtues of reason, Goodkind shows an apalling lack of logic (and imagination) in the creation of Richard's world. There seems to be no overall creative vision for this meandering series of books - Goodkind appears even more lost in his own work that Robert Jordan."
4,Worth the Read1,"Faith of the Fallen is really different from the other books in the Sword of Truth series. This book seems somehow darker, even though the ending leaves the characters on a higher note. This book seems to mirror real life a bit more in terms of life and death. Although characters have been knocked off in the past, this time we're faced with losing characters that we've gotten really close to in the last few books. My only problem with this book is that I was really hoping to run into Nathan Rahl again - I hope that Goodkind brings him back into the picture really soon!"
4,Pretty Good Sequel,"As a sequel to Soul of the Fire, I enjoyed the closer examination of The Imperial Order and some of the ideological implications of the book, they can definitely go beyond the pursuit of economic freedom alone. Although I must admit getting a little annoyed at the repetition in describing certain characters. I can understand the possible need for reiterating certain traits of the characters but it becomes unnecessary.The relationship between Richard and Kahlan appears as too perfect in all the series including this one, Kahlan's actions in Temple of the Winds notwithstanding. Richard's character is presented as likeable to the point of incredulity and at times I skipped a few lines of somewhat pretentious narration. The main characters could afford more of a blemish or two, it might make them more interesting.Now that there are troubles in the Imperial Order, I hope that the threat will come to an end."
2,"Too Political and preachy, story got lost.","The socialist world presented was too extreme to be believable, and the story degraded into sounding like the rantings of distrubed bitter old man. The ineptness of the leadership and councils was too extreme, and the evil too intentional to make sense for such a large movement. The side of good's evil wasn't addressed well, though at least it was more complex than pure evil against pure good. The whole nature of the story was distorted by the idea that a simple woodsman, could so easily outperform all the locals in a business he had no prior knowledge of. Again, a little more work justifying the sequence of events would have helped."
2,NO SWORD OF TRUTH,"I LOVED THE FIRST FEW BOOKS OF THE SWORD OF TRUTH NOVELS HOWEVER THE LAST TWO BOOKS ""SOUL OF THE FIRE"" AND ""FAITH OF THE FALLEN"" HAVE LITTLE OR NO ACTION WITH RICHARD EITHER USING HIS SWORD OR USING HIS MAGIC. THE SWORD AND THE MAGIC WERE THE REASONS WHY I LIKED THE SERIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE LAST TWO BOOKS FOR ME HAVE BEEN A REAL LET DOWN. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE VACATION IS OVER AND THE NEXT BOOK WILL GET BACK TO WHAT MADE THIS SERIES GREAT IN THE FIRST PLACE!"
3,Good Book. Heavy-handed politics.,"The previous reviews have summed this book up well. While it's a much better offering than `Soul of the Fire' (which I didn't much like) the politics invested in the plot line really spoilt it for me. I haven't read such simplistic interpretations of communism (BAD!) and capitalism (GOOD!) since the McCarthy trials in the 50's. Shades of Grey! Didn't see any at all. All the bad guys have now turned out to be communists (of all things - I was SO disappointed), until they see the light of the American ideal of capitalism. I say American because in most of the rest of the world's capitalist countries we incorporate a big chunk of communism thinking. Its not evil, just very expensive. It's called the well fare state!Despite all the criticism the book was a good read, which is praise indeed. All the characters I enjoy reading about were present. However I'm not sure I will buy the next instalment in hardback."
1,wasn't this book already written in the series?,"I just hope Richard and Kahlan die, I know I died a little bit when I finished this book."
2,Disappointing,"FotF is easily the worst book in the series. Not only does it needlessly repeat previously elucidated ideas (the whole capturing thing and the tyranny), but it spends too long on insignificant themes. The conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying. Also, Goodkind had led us to believe in previous books that Warren would one day be a great prophet; evidently, he changed his mind rather quickly. The whole Imperial Order/ Altur'Rang concept was a carbon copy of communist rule - I was hoping the author could be a little more creative. It seems that Goodkind simply ran out of steam for Faith of the Fallen. The series to this point has been wonderful but this book was simply a letdown."
3,"Good, but...","I did like this book. I must say that it was the best in the series in terms of character development and advance of the storyline - if this had been all the book had been, I would have given it five stars, and even six if I could. That being said, it is unfortunate that this is not all the book is. Maybe it's just me, but when I read a fantasy book, that's all I want to read - having to split it with a long dissertation against the evils of communism is not really my idea of a good time. In conclusion, I like it, and it's extremely well-written, but the preachy quality of it and the extremely overt moral could have been diminished greatly without damaging the image of the Order as the big evil (well, politically correctly, misguided) country."
5,Terry Goodkind's Best to Date,"In ""Faith of the Fallen"" Terry Goodkind successfully renews our faith in the romance, passion and integrity of Richard and Kahlan. The Sword of Truth series is truly addictive, but midway through Book 5 I felt my interest waning. However, Terry Goodkind left his heroine on the brink of death, making Book 6 a must-read. My faith is certainly renewed. Goodkind's writing has matured, making his genre inconsequential. His style is deeply felt, his characters' emotions justly portrayed, and his storyline evolves at a satisfying pace. I was becoming a little irritated by Kahlan in earlier books, but she really redeems herself in this story. This was a great book, and I hope that Terry Goodkind is hard at work on Book 7, as I cannot wait to read the further tales of these characters whom I have grown to care about."
3,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series. So naturally, I was attracted to the ""Sword of Truth"" series as well. It is well written and something I've enjoyed. Until now, that is. This 6th volume just dragged along without mercy. I wanted to stop and put it away on several occasions. I think of it as the 'pothole' of the bunch. I did barely manage to stop myself from returning it to the bookstore and have nothing further to do with the series. Thankfully, I gave it the benefit of the doubt due to past experience, and my patience did pay off near the end of the book. I do feel that I should've just waited for the paperback issue.Anyway, I just hope the next volume is able to live up to my expectations."
5,Very Good one of the best of the series.,This is a very good book. Although the plot is a little weak you know what is going to happen pretty much but the main plot is moved forward very well. It was a great surprise to see where it led Richard though and what would come of it.I enjoyed it and read every word of it. I hated to see some of my favorite characters go away but it was one of the best in the series so far.
5,The master storyteller comes forth again,What can I say! He did it again! This is one of the best books of the series! Lets just hope it doesnt stop!
3,Richard the Tamed,The first few chapters were so uninteresting that I almost put the book down. What happened to the magic and evergrowing growth into the all powerful War Wizard? There is nothing remarkable accomplished by Lord Rahl that any ordinary leader could not do. The basic plot is too predictable.Still and all the second half of the book was well written if wordy. The story flowed well enough to keep me wanting to see the finale blossum. If your a true fan of the series you will be happy enough to get to the next installment.
3,Long-winded,"Nothing in the plot will surprise readers of the rest of the books in the series. Goodkind uses this as an opportunity to expound on the evils of collectivism. Unfortunately, he takes too long to do it. Also, the plot with Ann, most likely included to provide a hook for the sequel, remains artificially unresolved."
4,Faith of the Fallen,"I thought this book was great ,but i would like to see Richard get together with Zedd and learn more of his power and see how strong he realy is ."
5,Filled in a lot of blanks,"I recently read Being Bliss which has finally been a book that speaks to some of my personal experiences of bringing the energy of the divine into the stream of manifestation in my life. It has also filled in a lot of blanks, especially in engaging with energy while on the path of Buddhism. And most especially on understanding and applying the teachings of emptiness in life.I also appreciate that Indigo has walked her talk ,even when great challenges of life have put her to the test, where most of us fall back on habitual patterns.She also reminds the reader often to check in with there own experience, and see if it true for themselves; this makes it real and alive!!It is sometimes very difficult to be openhearted in this world of aggression and competition. For me there is a subtle orb in my being that takes great attention and intention to turn toward the light when challenged, so I am deeply grateful for the gift of this book, thank you, thank you, thank you."
1,0 Stars If I Could.,"After reading the previous review, I decided to try it, since I was one of those late sleepers, early wakers.I've tried plenty of eye-bag removing lotins, creams, and ointments, and thinking this was the one, I boughtthis $32 small ointment/lotion.I just finished applying it, since I was about to go out with my boyfriend, and it actually made my bags more puffy and dark!I am not at all happy with this product.]:"
5,Sturdy and reliable,"The basket is strong enough for pots and pans. The sliding mechanism is smooth, and makes getting to lower cabinets a lot easier. I ordered a 2nd set."
5,Extra Heavy Duty = No Kiding!,"We ordered two of these for a bathroom vanity cabinet application. They are really overkill for what we will use them for (Kleenex & Toilet Paper), but no complaints. In a kitchen cabinet you could load these with the heaviest can goods or pots & pans and I'm sure they would perform perfectly. I would buy only this brand again if I needed to add a basket style drawer for another application. Super well made! Sold!"
1,Does not come with access code,"I purchased the book new from Amazon, but it does not come with the access code needed to access the online portion needed for class (the book indicates the code is supposed to come with the book). Add another $30 for the access code and all the savings for buying online are gone."
3,Installation Problematic,"System is designed for front installation in small room only. Speaker wires are short and terminated with proprietary connectors, which can not be purchased separately from Sony. For projector system installation with sound system at rear of room, speaker wire lengths are all wrong. Installation of longer, heavier gauge speaker wires would have been easy if the system used non-proprietary connectors, or the proprietary connectors could be purchased separately. In trying to make installation easier, Sony made it both harder and more expensive."
2,Just plain mediocre,"Well I'm sorry, but there is nothing on this album that I havn't heard maybe 2 billion times before. Where on Earth is the creativity? What makes this band any better then the thousands of other mediocre bands that sound just like them? Nothing as far as I'm concerned. Sure these tunes are catchy, and will appeal to the young mainstream croud, but if you know anything about writing and composing music you will see how incredibly simplistic these songs are. Still, there is much worse out there, so I'll cut them a little slack and give them two stars."
4,"Good, but not as good as ""Tip""","I've only had one full listen and heard about half the songs 2-3 times, so this is a first impression. There are a few songs which I really like immediately, like ""Sick of it All"" and ""Suffocate"". This CD had a muddier, less ""crisp"" sound than ""Tip"" and is heavier overall. The songs don't flow as well as those on ""Tip"". While a pretty strong CD, it is considerably different than Tip. Rating: 3 stars comparing with Tip (one of my favorite CDs ever) 4 stars compared to other recent entries in the genre."
5,Easily Their Best,"I can confidently say this is the most impressive and diverse album that Finger Eleven has ever put out. Strarting off with First Time hooks you and gets you into the whole album. Nearly every song on the CD takes a different mood, from the slower melodic Bones + Joints, to the more upbeat For the Ocean. This is a must have for anyone who considers themselves to be a Finger Eleven fan."
2,letdownville,"Started out great, but fizzled into a typical 3rd rate suspense yarn. I think this book has put me over the edge. I'm giving up reading books of this kind and will do more research on who is writing better stories that don't let me down at the end."
2,Disappointing,"It's about time JCO bothered to create a new character, someone different from herself. A name for the protagonist wasn't necessary since she was Marya all over again meant to dazzle us, or somehow shock us, with her interracial relationship and her sorority tribulations. Now, the object of her affections, this Vernor, would have made a far more interesting protagonist and could be used again since we learned little about what he wanted out of life. For our protagonist, it was obvious. She needed material so she could be a writer. Lacking in plot, the book offered the usual good visualizations, but I had trouble finishing it."
4,Surprisingly Engaging,Salvatore developed the character of Artemis very nicely in this book and made it possible for him to be the focus of a series of books. Also there were many new characters added into the book that were never heard about before and Salvatore did a good job of giving each of them their own identity and role in the story development. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the story and plan on getting the third book in the series.
4,Another Hit for R.A.,"This is a very well put together story on the part of R.A. and a great read. The first full novel revolving around Jarlaxle and Artemis is full of action and continued character growth for Artemis foremost and some on Jarlaxle's side. A great power has been rediscovered and the two unlikely companions arrive to investigate and see how to profit from the unfolding events. Jarlaxle with always the bigger picture and this time a much bigger picture, drops them into their greatest challenge yet. The book is fast paced with just enough background to flesh out the supporting cast. R.A. also develops another great dwarf character, seems to have a real knack for that. Fans of R.A. should be pleased with this effort and look forward to further adventures."
3,The Joke,"Ignorance is well crafted much like Unbearable Ligthness of Being. However I still recommend everyone to pick up The Joke, one of Kundera's earlier and controversial works."
3,wow,"tough childhood, I wish Lorna Sage would write another memoir telling us how she's doing right now.I liked the book."
3,Illiad myth or legend,"The Illiad is a good book about the battle of Troy. The book describes the battles quite well, maybe too well for some peoples likeing. In my opinion I thought it was a good book, but was hard to read and understand who was talking to who. All in all I think that if you like Greek Myth then this my be a book that you may want to read."
2,Illiad,Book delivered in proper manner but the book was not in that good of shape. Book has writing in it...many pages of writing and few pages glued together. Should maybe look over books before put up for sale.
2,hard version,"this book was ok because of the graphic violence, and because of the killing, the greek gods and the trojan war, most of this book is hard to understand and personally i thought it was very hard to read, my teacher said it was hard for me to understand because i got the hardest version of the book, to understand the book you have to pay attention through the beggining."
1,Bland,"I really did not enjoy this book. It proved to be bland, repetitive, boring, and not worth my time. It was much more to my benefit to read summaries of this book."
3,"A good poem, but it's not the Iliad","This poet's rendition of the _Iliad_ is enchanting, flows well, and may often fill one with a dramatic sense of awe. However, for all of that, it is not the _Iliad_ in any of the ways in which its original audience would have construed the poem. This poem retains very few of the features of the original oral-tradition deived work other than at least retaining scenes in the correct order. If a reader wants a fun poem to read in his or her spare time, this version of the Greek classic is fine; if one wishes to know what Homer actually sang and how he sang it, there are many other translations out there that do far more justice to the original poetics of this epic masterpiece."
5,Towering Characters & Story.,"Perfect translation of Homer for the average reader with useful notes and glossary(Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition). Great book to start with for entering the world of Homer. If you give this book the attention it deserves it shall be rewarding in so many ways. Homer contains a universal moral-compass, and should be read by everyone at some time in their life. Towering characters facing death, fate, wisdom: this book has it all. Highly Recommended to all. Also, the book-binding for this edition lays comfortable in your hands and looks impressive."
4,"Accessible , but not great.","The Iliad. You know the story. The Rage of Achilles. Great story. One of the, if not the pillar of Western Literature. Fagles is a latest to do a major translation of this story. I like it better than Fitzgerald's, but this is the only case. I don't think Lattimore is very accessible for the first time reader. I also like the anglicized names, which Fitzgerald does not do. However, the translation is not perfect. It is a little too modern for my taste, and does not give the formality and mysticism that Homer so rightfully deserves. For example, the constant use of B**ch degrades it. He also changes the epitaphs around a lot. Overall good, the best out now, but there can be better."
3,Great Translation - Bad Kindle Version,"This is not so much a review of the book or the translation itself, which I find quite good. Rather, it is concerning the Kindle version. This version contains many spelling errors. One of the most common is that in a large amount of cases an 'm' is used in place of 'rn.' For example: modem instead of modern. You will find an average of one spelling error for every 10 pages. This can be very frustrating at times, but I got used to it and no longer cringe at it.In conclusion, if you must read this on Kindle (I much prefer reading on Kindle to physical books myself) and if you must read Fagles translation (which is probably the most readable to the average person), then buy it provided you can overlook the spelling errors. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,"My Least Favorite ""Good"" Clash Album (4.5 stars)","In my eyes, there are only three Clash albums worth owning, and those are the self-titled, this one and ""London Calling"". On this album, you can see The Clash somewhat abandoning their punky roots in favor of straight up rock. The punk spirit is still there, but the sound is a bit more polished. Although this contains my favorite Clash song (""Safe European Home""), Its just not as enjoyable as the other two. ""The Clash"" was a punky reggae party, while ""London Calling"" was a diverse masterpiece. This, on the other hand, is just.. rock. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but The Clash could've done better than this. Plus, this contains the worst ""punk"" era Clash song, ""Cheapskates"". However, even with these complaints, I still reccomend this album. It may not be the best Clash album, but it is still worth buying, unlike their later crap like ""Combat Rock"" or ""Cut the Crap""."
3,Maybe they were tired?,"I am a huge fan of The Clash, but for some reason I do not find GIVE 'EM ENOUGH ROPE to be particularly appealing. This album seems to lack a lot of the energy and enthusiasm that made their other early albums so great. I'm not exactly sure what the reason for this is. Perhpas it's a combination of things. The writing doesn't seem to be as good. The performances don't seem to be especially instense. The fact that this album was produced (actually, *over*-produced would be a better word) by the same guy who worked with Blue Oyster Cult certainkly does not help. Whatever the reason(s), this album does not hold any strong appeal to me. Perhaps I have simply been spoiled by some of the other albums by The Clash!"
4,"A bit messy, but still good","Yes, ""Safe European Home"" sports one of the most jaw-dropping, monstrous, head-stompingly powerful riffs ever written, but the rest of this album is powerful but *muddled* - the band's messy punk fury worked beautifully on ""The Clash"" but on this record they expand their sound without refocusing their energy, and that makes the five-minute length of some of these songs a bit inappropriate. The album is sarcastic (a plus) but too short (a minus) -- this is proto-London Calling."
1,Pixel Chix Chix 2 Story House,The Pixel Chix 2 Story House was suppose to intertwine with other Pixel Chix products - I had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa - did not work - returned this item.
4,Kid Pix Deluxe 3rd Edition,"I purchased this game for my 5 yr old. She uses the same program at school. It is a good way for young children to learn to point and click as well as be creative. This program has a lot of scenes and drag and drop features. You can also free hand color. she enjoys the program, and I like the fact she is learning to use the computer."
5,Sturdy glassware for everyday use,"We purchased two sets and use them daily. These glasses are substantial in weight and take the abuse of ceramic counter tiles well. Whatever we want to drink, one of the size choices always seems to be just right. I think they are a real value too."
5,"Old maid's folly, black venus and other Texas legal tales","This book is written with a wit and charm rarely found in books today, and offers an endearing look at small town Texas life in the early 20th century. It reminds me of a simpler, slower time when common sense came first. It's hard to find, but is well worth the search - I love this book and couldn't be happier to have it in my collection."
5,buy this album,"Benefit for the foundation fighting blindness. Only 4 bucks and has awesome songs. My favorites were both fifteen songs, the algebra one song and the kid dynamite song, and the weakerthans. Come on! 4 bucks! Benefit the blind! Get it!"
4,a fresh perspective,"In a culture where getting a divorce is almost reflexive when any marital problem may occur, this book provides an alternative frame of mind. My hope is that many would read this book as a preventative measure; before their marriage is on the rocks. Although, there are many examples in this book where such marriages have been saved as well. Easy to read and practical application points."
2,BabyAge is Terrible,"The bike arrived damaged - the fork was bent and scratched. Other than the fork, the rest of the bike was fine. I called the company to send a replacement fork and they told me the bike was a 2004 model and they didn't have any parts that would work for it. I had not known the bike was outdated. The only option they gave me was to return the complete bike. My son liked the bike and didn't want to return it, so I ordered a fork off ebay. I would never buy from BabyAge again. Their prices are so cheap only because their products are outdated leftovers that you can't get replacement parts for."
