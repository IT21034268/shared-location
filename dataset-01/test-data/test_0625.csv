3,Kids book arrived slightly damages,The book we ordered was in great shape but it was not mailed in a padded envelope and consequently it was bent alomst in half when it arrived.
1,Available on a much cheaper DVD,"The reason for the one star is the cost of this item. I give the film 5 stars, but you do not need to spend $115 for a program that is available on another DVD. Mickey's Christmas Carol is available on Disney Animation Collection 7: Mickey's Christmas Carol (1993), which only cost $13. Save yourself the money and still get this great film."
1,ouch ouch ouch,My hands hurt. I made lovely pink grapefruit juice but with one hand holding the grapefruit down and the other trying to keep this machine from jerking to the side and spewing juice all over the counter....well. You get the picture. Don't buy this!
3,Does the job,"I got this juicer for my home grown citrus. I have tried it on my grapefruit, and it reams out the peel very well, and juices it completely. The only thing that I would warn you about is the auto reverse feature. Every time you shift your hand or ease up the pressure, the juicing will stop, and will resume in the opposite direction. This is good for juicing, but can cause your hand to slip, and the juicer to rotate away from you. This will cause the spout to move away from whatever you are having the juice pour into. Be prepared and have a good grip on both the fruit and the juicer to avoid this and the resulting splash on the counter."
1,do not buy this cheap product,"I would rather use my hands on a washboard to have juice.Sticks when you lift your hand and fruit off, had to change clothsafter using this thing. I would not recommend and will not buyanymore Cuisinart If this is what they have to offer.do not buy."
1,Tossed it,"We bought this at a thrift store (still in the box and marked ''new'') for just $18, so we aren't out much money. I used it once before recycling the removable parts and tossing the base. It did make me laugh as it bounced around the counter, spewing sticky juice here and there. I can't believe Cuisinart put this thing on the market."
1,One star is an over rating,"I echo everything that was said negative and dispute any positive statement. How could Cuisinart screw up that much? After one orange the cup is clogged with the pulp which does not release even at the ""lots of Pulp setting"". Very cheap plastic construction. Not worth trying."
4,Best juicer for the price!!,"I love this juicer. I actually bought a more expensive one ($100) hoping to get a better unit for grapefruits. Not possible. This unit works great for small limes and large grapefruits and for the price you cannot go wrong! Also, the manufacturer's warranty is great. The inner gears started making a lot of noise and they replaced it - not problems!!"
3,Real Use Experience,"Everything is fine with this product, except, the dish with the holes that squeezed juice and pulp slide in. The shape of this dish is not right. The the lip on the curcumference is an obstacle to clear the dish of pulp every once in a while; it needs to be cleared for the juice to flow through into the receptacle."
1,Junk!,It appears to this consumer that a Cuisinart engineer started out with a vast idea and ended up with a half vast product. The juicer does nothing well or even half way satisfactorily. Would be ashamed to dispose of it at a garage sale.
1,Horrible,Whoever was behind the design of this over-priced piece of garbage should be fired. The design is terrible. Every aspect of this juicer is terrible...unless your only looking to squeeze the juice out of one lime or lemon at a time. The cheap toastmaster juicer is much better then this...and has lasted over 2 years...with heavy use. Do not buy this juicer...dont be fooled by the name or the nice look.
1,"Great juicer, but frustrating to use...","This juicer has a great motor and it really extracts the maximum amount of juice from citrus. However, the body of the unit is too light and it constantly moves and turns while you are juicing, which is very frustrating. I have tried many ways to resolve the problem to no avail, so despite how good it is in terms of extracting juice, I chose to throw it out."
1,Not worth the electricity it uses...,"I got this item on a lark from a home store in the area with a 20% off coupon. I have several other Cuisinart kitchen appliances which work wonderfully. I used it to juice several oranges during which it performed terribly. First, as many others mentioned the spout is small and close to body, which means at least 20% of the juice ends up on the counter. Second, the spinning of the unit is unpredictable, which causes further spillage. Third, the pulp catcher serves no purpose other than to clog the unit requiring constant cleaning. Finally, after about a dozen oranges the unit died. I will definitely be returning this unit to the retailer for a refund."
1,Poor Product,"After going through 2 cheap juicers, Id advise anyone to just put up the extra 40 bucks and but a Waring or better product. This product really is as annoying as everyone says."
4,Juicer Worked Well,"We are really pleased with this juicer. We read your mostly negative reviews so were pleasantly surprised. The juicer does want to turn on the counter, but that was easily solved. We put a silicone pot holder under it."
1,Dear Mr/Ms Cuisinart,"I purchased your product because of the good reputation for strong motors and good design. But this juicer was a real let down. Why?1.the spout is too short and the juice runs down the side of the machine2.If you don't hold onto the machine for dear life whilst squeezing the whole machine does a little piroet and whoops, the juice is everywhere!I am returning this machine and I advise people to buy a citrus juicer where the juice streams into an internal cup. But don't buy the Toast Master because the plastic starts to melt under the motor (a litle like toast)."
2,Cuisinart has made better products,"The device isn't stable. Also, the motor lags when you really get that orange in there. And I always make a mess, which breaks my heart because that's juice lost, which takes so long to squeeze. I bought this a year ago and now I""m looking to buy one of the old-fashioned hand press."
3,Still Good Times but Not Much Better,"The only thing that I think makes this better then Good Times is that it's a double disc. There's enough good songs to fill one disc, but one disc could have just been outtakes. Excellent parodies of Tom Petty and other stoner rock. His animosity towards the music industry matches the likes of Tech N9ne and Dead Prez. Maybe the 8 or 9 songs that I dont like will grow on me once Summer hits."
3,There has been better,"This cd is alytyte, ther are maybe 7 good songs on here. The others are ok i guess they just dont appeal to my style. His first was better but im glad i bought this cd cuz there are a few good songs on it"
3,Good book for beginners,"I recently started collecting inkwells and purchased this book as a basic guide. I was hoping it might contain more information about the different types of inkwells that were produced in various time periods, countries, etc...it does provide pictures and descriptions by type of inkwell (wood, brass) and offers some period info - it's great for basic identification but I've learned a lot more from other collectors and on eBay! It's a good starter book, but very basic in content and information. Not any information on markings either."
2,Low quality and worse shipping,"I ordered this item as part of a halloween costume, scheduled to arrive in about a week. It showed up closer to a month later, well past any usefulness. Upon opening, I discovered an unpackaged roll of aged and partially deformed tape buried under several books of advertisements.The only reason this review isn't a 1 is because I haven't had a chance to test the effectiveness of the (yellowed and fraying) tape--I had to pay more money to a different seller to get something usable in time. Extremely late, low quality, and vastly more advertisements than product. I would not buy from this seller again."
5,Snoopy Clock,"Wow I was so happy when I got this for my Birthday. But lets get to the point. The clock. It was a little hard to figure out at first, but then it was so easy. Who ever is a snoopy craze, like me, I would say to get this clock as soo as you can. AMAZING!!!!"
3,"good, in generel but...","I purchased these gloves to wear while watching my nephew race his ATV during the winter months. As far as warmth, they are O.K., they work better if you wear them under another pair of gloves. As far as being able to do things with your hands while wearing, they are very good. I can assemble my camera and gear while wearing the gloves. The one real drawback is durability. after just a few weeks (wearing them for, approx. 1 to 2 days out of the week) the seams at the base of the thumb, started to separate. I sewed this separation and went on with life. Within another couple of weeks, the seam farther back towards the wrist is now separating. Once is happenstance, twice is tendancy. If the seams were, perhaps, double stitched, they would be fine. I have now done any type of strenuous activity with the gloves, so that has not been an issue."
2,Kovels',"It had a lot of good information, but hardly ANY pictures to help identify the bottles. The good pictures were of bottles most of us will never see or find. What about the bottles we find at auctions, garage sales etc. Lots of us are NOVICE collectors, and we need more pictures to help us identify what we have. As far as I'm concerned, I've wasted my money. It isn't much help to this new novice. If your a professional bottle collector, this is the book for you."
3,A fast guide to identifying and pricing old bottles,"Organized by bottle type (medicine, beer, etc.), this comprehensive book quickly enables the reader to track down a wide variety of bottles from by-gone days. The authors have wisely included descriptions of various bottle types and their intended uses. This will help novice bottle collectors to better research their bottles as the purpose of many bottled products no longer holds any signficance to modern folks (this is especially true for medicines and elixirs that existed before the dawn of the Food & Drug Administration). Readers would be better served if more pictures could be found as well as timelines regarding a bottler's production dates. But the omission of these items is understandable regarding the overall convenience and ease of using this book."
4,The prod is very good,Bought this product and it's vey good. Keeps the rice warm and does not get dried up. The only thing is it takes sometime to cook.
1,Zojirushi NS-MYC18 Micom Fuzzy Logic 10 Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer,The rice cooker time takes to long
4,A good read!,"When I read the back cover of this, it didn't seem too interesting. But in fact, it's a solid read.For me, it wasn't so much about discovering who the killer is in this book. The thing I liked more was portrayal of characters. I think Carter is a very interesting character, and so is Adam. I like how Carter's world is completely different than Adam's, and how it's described.But don't think the plot was bad, not at all. It was a pretty suspensful book. Although I prefer Sunburn and Lights Out to this book, I still really liked it."
5,"At first it's confusing, but it turns out really good.",This book will really confuse you if you like to skip around. You will be confused if you don't read it from cover to cover. I will give you one clue: It is not who you think it is beleive me
3,Cute Gnome,I purchased this Gnome as a gift for a friend. I was somewhat surprised that it was not ceramic or plaster as mosts gnomes are but the gnome is really cute. The down side is that the gnome is suppose to light up after dusk (solar powered) but it does NOT light up. I would have returned it but my friend did not want me to have to go through the hassle. So VERY disappointed he doesn't light up but happy that she still likes her gift!
2,It had it's moments,3060 was probably the worst technical readout made. The vehicles were interesting but the mech designs we're laughable. there were a few decent mechs such as the new viking for the IS as well as the nova cat and cougar for the clans. I suggest you go to a store and copy out these 3 mechs and save you money for a good TRO like 3058.
2,3rd time is NOT a charm... probably.,"The light came on as soon as I inserted the 3 AAA batteries (not included). When I pushed the switch up, the light still remained! The light was always on regardless of the switch position.The light was bright and totally illuminated both sides of the book in complete darkness. I was very happy with it, but I decided I would be too annoyed to always have to remove the batteries whenever not in use.I returned it and received another one at no charge. This time around, the light did not turn on regardless of the switch position (using the same and different batteries--all new). Needless to say, I've returned that as well.For those of you who might get lucky and receive a fully functional one, then you should be pretty happy with it. I've decided to opt out on the second, free replacement."
2,It worked okay...until it broke!,"It only lasted 6 months before the wiring broke inside. My advice is, if you do buy one, don't twist the light at all when you pull it out of the base. I also didn't like the fact that it illuminated the whole room when I would read at night. I won't buy another one, that's for sure."
1,"No Happy with it. It came in an unmarked plastic bag, looks nothing like a real Oregon chain purchased previously",This chain came in an unmarked plasic bag. There are no marking on the chain that are similar to any of my old chains. Unfortunatly I threw away the shipping container before I looked at the chain closely or I would have sent it back. This chain looks like a cheep copy of a real Oregon Chain. I am almost afraid to put it on my saw. I would never recommend this to anyone and will never purchase one of these again.
1,"Pass at all costs, unless you are an extreme die-hard","This is a compilation of the Brothers material on Arista records in the early 80s. Both albums on Arista are baaaad. I would skip this at all costs. If you are new to the ABB, I would get any one of their first 5 albums: Allman Brothers Band, Enlightened Rogues (or get Beginnings which is the first two on 1 disc), Fillmore Concerts (Live At Fillmore East plus additional songs), Eat A Peach and Brothers & Sisters. Enlightened Rogues was another great one in 1979. If you want to get something from their 90s collection, you might want to start with Seven Turns or An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band - both are a return to form & complete albums from end to end. Mycology is a best-of CD of their material from 1990-1995 & is very nice if you are convinced you won't buy more than a couple of their albums. BOTTOM LINE: PASS ON MADNEST FROM THE WEST."
3,Inaccurate Description,"Just for the record, this isn't a ""best of"" collection. It is a two-fer, i.e., it contains the ABB's two Arista albums (""Reach for the Sky"" and ""Brothers of the Road""), minus one song that wouldn't fit."
4,An exciting new perspective in psychology,"Instead of basing psychology from the point of view of the individual and personal gratification and development, this book shifts our view to the realm of relationships and connection. The basic human need is not solely self-gratification in the way we usually think of it, but a desire for mutually empathic & empowering connection with others which is gratifying and results in psychological growth for all parties. The book lays out the beginnings of this new view and what it means to psychology. The book reflects the fact that this theory is still new and developing. The ideas and thoughts are sure to make a difference in the way psychology is practiced in the future. All the basics of this aspect of psychology are laid out and illustrated. Though there is still work to be done in this area of the field, the book is a good opening."
2,Not as helpful as I had hoped.......,"I got this product for road tar and bug stains after traveling to Florida. I had used Klasse All-in-one for most of the residue but was having problems removing smaller stains and thought a product made strictly for cleaning might work better. Not so. Basically very few of the really deep road tar stains came out even though I rubbed it like a maniac ( of course, using a soft cloth). Really, I would have to say that the Klasse worked far better with less effort."
5,perfect rice!,"I received this rice cooker last night - washed it, and immediately used it to cook 2 cups of rice (2 cups dry). I timed it to see how long it took to cook & it was only 16 minutes!! I couldn't believe it. The rice was perfect. It probably would have been even more fluffy if I had let it soak for 30 mins like the directions suggested. It's a perfect size for the 2 of us - with the occasional guests - you can cook 5.5 cups of dry rice which is 10 cups of cooked.I'm going to try some brown rice this weekend. I can't wait."
2,Not for Brown Rice!,"Design defect: Making brown rice generates more steam, which condenses onto the top. Zojirushi now tells me this model is not designed for brown rice. (Their website says that ""perfect brown rice is made easy with Zojirushi rice cookers."" FAQ15 They and Amazon need to conspicuously say that this model is not for brown rice.) As for the disappointing rice with less water, they said to try soaking the rice before cooking. (Which isn't in the instructions and isn't what I expected in an automatic cooker.)"
2,Disappointed in quality and durability,"My last Zojirushi rice cooker lasted 10 years with constant use and even survived 3 major moves so when it finally died, I decided to buy the same brand. I opted to try a different model and purchased this one from amazon. Unfortunately, after only 7 months, the rice cooker no longer works properly and cooks the rice unevenly. The bottom is overcooked and the top is al dente. I am very disappointed with this model so I am going to purchase the one I used to have. Even though my old one cost more than $200, it lasted 10 years. This one cost me a little over $100 and it lasted 7 months. Skip over this one and buy a different model. You'll be glad you did."
1,"Poorly Organized, Shameless Self-Promotion","While this text includes the more salient points in strategic management, I found the organization poor throughout the book, and moreover, I found the author on p. 153 and other places selling his own products and services without disclaimer of their source. I'm surprised this book got printed. I hope the later edition was more tasteful, but I'm thinking not."
1,BOO!,"I typed in the exact title, author, and edition of the book described on my school's website, and this book came up. This book ONLY includes the CASES...none of the CONCEPTS. I am now in week 4 of my class (out of 10) and need to hunt down the other 'half' of the book. I have been winging it since the class started, and looking up the conceptual references online."
4,Good on my Touch Pad tablet,This item was a very easy download to my HP Touch Pad. I always liked to read EdgarAllen Poe's works and this replaces a set of his volumes that I lent to a friend many years ago and I never got them back.
1,Utter Junk - DO NOT PURCHASE,"When I ordered this planer. No other reviews had been posted. I only needed to trim up a couple of doors. The product arrived in substandard packaging, the knob adjusting the front depth does not work, so it will not cut wood at all. The instructions are faded, and in broken english - useless."
4,hmmm .. definitely not a dvd,"i bought this thinking it was the dvd of the series ...but it was a music cd from the series.. don't get me wrong as a music cd it is great, and i fully intend to keep it. but, someone should fix the product description ... please."
3,OK but a better collection could have been had,This actually applies to all three albums which are a compilation of the Irish influence on American music. While many of the songs are interesting - I believe there are much better sets.
3,Kilkelly Ireland,"Well I just wanted the song ""Kilkelly Ireland"" and I got it. There are also some other lovely songs on the CD. Easy listening at it's best"
2,No change.,"Did not notice any change whatsoever in the pain I was experiencing for my plantar fasciitis. Still have the pain, still have the magnetics. They just did not work."
2,This is not a stand alone type of novel,"Turning Point was an okay read. I actually started out the series with ""Fortune's Wheel"". I think you can just start out there. It really is a great series. Some of the books are pretty thick and I actually read all of them! Turning Point is not a great book if you read it by itself. If you do read it, keep in mind it's not a stand alone type of novel. There are lots of loose ends. It definitely feels incomplete."
2,Nice story but partially faked and way too preachy,"Watched this on a whim on Netflix streaming and liked it for the most part. Significant flaws with this file, however.Pros:- great story, following a turtle from hatching, across the Atlantic, in the Azores, off Nova Scotia, in the Carribean, and finally mating and laying eggs on the Florida shore.- Beautifully photographedCons:- The filmmaker readily admits that portions of the film were shot in tanks and used special FX and blue screen technology. (Search New York Times film review and turtle for details) So, not everything we saw was real. Is this still a documentary? Not in my book.- The voice over cannot contain her love of everything green and dislike for human endeavors like ships, buildings, etc.Given these flaws, I cannot recommend this film.I would like to see a marine biologist review this film and comment on the special effects."
1,too much of romantic narration,"the narrator uses a lot of form of speech adequately for novel and romance. Indeed my 7 years old son could not understand most of the narration because the stupid story goes like if where a Robin Hood tall tale; the music is alright if you where in a classical concert, not quite right for a ""documentary"" such as this one was supposed to be one.Thanks God I got this video free since I'm a premium member, otherwise I would it be mad to pay for this time waster.One star is too much rating but the system here will not allow me to rate it less than one star.Now i will have to order (since I'm already here in amazon)some Tylenol for the freaking headache I got for watching this ""documentary"".Don't buy this!"
2,"Many staged scenes, the credits say so.","I saw this movie in the theater it is quite a poor ""documentary"". They are constantly trying to push their ""green"" and conservation agenda to the point where they constantly stage fake situations. Even the credits say many scenes were re-created and staged in tanks, and even before I read the credits stating this, I could tell many of the shots were faked. Some of the shots are pretty, but I have to take off marks for it not being a credible documentary. There is a scene of turtle sex though, and I guess it is worth watching for that."
2,Susannah7,"The cinematography is beautiful, but set up at times, to further the story along. The announcers statements border on the ridiculous at times, saying things such as, ""200 million years ago the turtles were initially land animals, until the dinosaurs showed up and drove them to the sea. But the dinosaurs would have their revenge, as the land would not forgive them, and make them come back every year."" How ridiculous is that? When they later make attempts at authenticity, they have made so many lame-brain statements that you cannot trust their story. I would not subject a child to this film unless he/she were warned that this is a fairy tale."
4,Fabulous ID guide for collectors and dealers,This book is worth every penny. Lots of clear beautiful pictures- tons of outfits and dolls included in the book- with nice pictures and descriptions.No accessories included in the book and the value guide was not great- it was listed at the end of the book and the specific doll outfits were not priced individually.
2,Beth Gunther Book Is Much Better,This author is not a Crissy collector and the coverage is spotty. The best Crissy book is written by Beth Gunther.
3,Not bad -- but better options exist,"I live in Boston. In the winter the dry air mandates that one have good skin moisturizers, and that includes the lips. Dry and cracked lips are uncomfortable to say the least.After using this daily for a month I found my lips were still dry and cracking. A friend suggested Burt's Bees Honey Lip Balm which I picked up at CVS for a fraction of the price of this product. In less than a week my lips are doing great.If you live in a warmer climate you'll probably be fine with this product. This far north, however, it just doesn't seem up to the job."
1,"A sad, unfortunate attempt to sell books.","Please be aware, this is not an acurate tranlation of the original text. The actual text has been changed - ""culturized"" to be more politically correct. This version is not trustworthy, as it is not what God really said...Please pray for the editors and publishers."
4,Not Covered by 2 Year Warranty,No one told us we will be spending over $100 per year to maintain this oven. There is a gasket--a rubber strip running around the opening of the oven that seals hot air in when the door is closed--that has only a 90-day warranty & needs to be replaced shortly after that time at a cost of $35 plus shipping. Ours broke & began to fall off after 4 months. Surprising given the overall good construction of the oven. Customer service was not responsive to our e-mails.
1,Junk,"First off, the packaging was horrible. It came in a box not much bigger than the pan with NO packing at all. The handle was sticking out the side of the box when I got it!! No biggie though. I opened the box and found the pan to be of poor quality, the handle was barely long enough for me to hold in my hand and with no handle opposite, it would be a chore to move this baby around when you had a few pounds of food in it!! The casting was REALLY rough and you could see that there was about a 3 inch spot in the middle where the casting was very thin. This thing was junk and I sent it back to be replaced by a Lodge. Bayou Classics are cast in China and they look like it!! Wish I knew that before I ordered it!!"
3,battle athletes :has won my heart,this is the first anime i seen but i loved it. if you have a chance buy it and watch it 4 or 5 time a day it's that good just tell me how you feel of this movie i want to hear and you better talk good about it couse it is a good movie
3,A short straight edge,"This straight edge looks about 2 inches long on my screen. There is no clue how long it actually is, but for the price I would be reluctant to take a chance on it being any longer than that. I would find anything less than 6 inches long to be fairly useless."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I read the reviews on this site, and went to buy this book. After bringing it home, I found that it was not what I expected at all. The contents were for much more specialized applications, and didn't appear to apply to the average Excel user. I've used Excel for several years, and haven't had much of a need for many of these specialized tips. I found a few things here and there that may have been helpful, but not enough to justify buying the book.(What really surprised me is that when I brought it back to the store, the fellow at the counter gave me a funny look, and asked why I was returning it. When I replied that it just wasn't what I expected, he said that I was the third person to return that same book in the last month!)"
2,Guerilla Data Analysis...mis-represented,This is basically a manual describing how to sort data etc...Data analysis in my mind is statistical analysis...I am very unhappy with this book...don't buy it unless you want to format tables etc...It says nothing about data analysis...
1,Way Too Small,This crate was way too small for my 12 lb Lhasa-poo. Returned it and ordered next size up.
2,Misleading,"T-Fal irons are always good. But, the write up of the product forgot to indicate that it is an old model."
3,Over rated !!,"I wanted a book that would give me a good insight into the principles of Advertising, so I purchased ""Ogilvy on Advertising""- based on the good reviews it had on Amazon.Unfortunately I was dissappointed, as the book is very basic and is more a PR for Ogilvy and the AD campaigns his company executed.This book is definately over rated !!"
5,Magnificent!,This book shares a lot of valuable lessons in advertising.The tips Ogilvy gives to the reader are timeless and will continueto dominate the advertising world for many years to come.Wise investment for anyone who's looking to improve his marketing.Igor Kheifets[...]
4,Sex Sells!,"I picked up ""Oglivy on Advertising"" with high hopes for a keen insight into the world of golden-age advertising. In this regard, Oglivy's definitive work delivers in spades. The AMC show ""Mad Men"" immortalizes these characters in a mildly entertaining prime time melodrama. There are plenty of nice-looking breasts throughout this book. Really, I was impressed. Moreover, Oglivy's proposed ""solution"" to dealing with alcoholics is uhh... ironic as most of these folks were themselves sauce monsters. I found this a very entertaining read, but one that is sorely outdated. I truly wish there was a present-day take on the advertising industry that projects a similar flamboyant approach."
5,A must read for anyone even remotely involved with advertisi,Simply put; David Ogilvy is a genius. This is bar none the greatest book ever written on the subject of Advertising.
3,Incomplete,"The book itself is excellent. The ""product"" was less than desirable. The book arrived without the cover, which is an important component to this historic book."
2,Not worth the money,The book read more like an ode to Ogilvy then a book on the mechanics of advertising. What I was looking for was a book that would improve my skills in convincing people to make cultural changes at work. This book did not help me. I had to get rid of it because my kids saw the naked women advertisement examples.
5,Better than a 4 Year Degree in Advertising,"Despite some of the reviewers comments that Ogilvy's ""On Adversting"" is irrelevant because his work predates the Internet, this book is a 'must read' for anyone venturing into the world of advertising.I prefer that you not read it, as I do not need any more knowledgeable competition. I would disregard is basic advice only grudgingly, and probably to my, my agency's and my client's detriment.I would be surprised if 2% of his comments are truly outdated. He knows more about how to sell via ads than almost anyone in the business. He clearly and simply makes point after point about how to get and keep the attention of the audience... not to entertain...but to sell. Although many would like you to think that human nature suddenly changed with the web, it hasn't. His comments and the vast majority of his techniques remain today, highly valuable. His general business advice is invaluable."
2,This is not my idea of a trilogy...,"I just finished this book a few minutes ago. The story is good, but I want to express my extreme frustration with the ending. A trilogy is a story told in three parts, NOT one third of a story that just stops and the reader has to wait a year for the next chapter. The books in Tolkien's Ring trilogy did not end with cliff hangers such as this. I have read every book Brooks has written. The other Word and Void books could stand alone.I am disapointed in the handling of this story so far.Peggy"
4,Interesting twist,"An interesting twist on the Shanarra story...another author's look at what happens in the aftermath of destruction...the ""destructuring"" and restructuring of society as well as the development of forces related to good and evil...a good read!"
3,Interesting but also disappointing,"Armageddon's children provides a continuation to the excellent Terry Brooks ""Word and Void"" series. The book introduces some interesting new characters and offers some provocative insights into the direction that America and the world is heading.Two main problems I had with this book (and I have read the entire Shannara series):1. The tie-in to Elves in this work dilutes the strength of the story line2. The book is short, and provides a cliffhanger ending, ostensibly to get readers to snap up the next volume in this series. It reflects a desire to generate as much revenue as possible with the minimum acceptable product. The interesting characters could have been developed more effectively in a longer version of this book."
2,Unsatisfying - clumsy story construction.,"The problem here is that the book ended like the power going out at the movies - practically in mid-sentence. That is upsetting and unsatisfying.Characters are being attacked, chased, hunted. A magical flash of light hides what happens to the key character. That's where the book ends.The fact that it is the first book of a trilogy doesn't excuse the lack of resolution. It is the author's duty to manage the construction of the story. It is no one else's responsibility. If the story is too unwieldy, the author should re-work it into connected, but reasonably self-contained segments.This is the first Terry Brooks book I've read. I was sucked in by the dust cover description inviting ""new readers"" and assuring this book would be good for first time readers.Well, BAH! on that! I hate the feeling this book left me with, and l feel cheated of the time I invested in reading it."
2,It bogged down in the middle,"Getting very tired of volumes that bog down in the middle with battle scenes that go on and on. The beginning and first few chapters were excellent, but then it was if the author ran out of steam. Sorry. It just didn't keep my interest."
5,He's done it again!,"Terry Brooks never fails to amaze me...(which is probably why he's my favorite author); Armageddon's Children was fantastic! And much like his other books, I couldn't put this one down!I was totally drawn in with this story line and the characters. One of the things I enjoyed while reading this, was how it made me think about how I would handle myself in this sort of situation, should it arise. And, if there is anything I can do to help prevent it from happening. So not only was it thoroughly entertaining, it was also thought provoking.When I reached the end, I was immediately wanting to read more of the story! I can't wait until the next one comes out! If you've read and loved any of Terry Brooks' other books, then you MUST read this one!"
2,Just not the Terry Brooks I knew and loved...,"Let me preface what I am about to say by admitting that I have read all of the ""Sword of Shannara"" series, and absolutely loved each and every one of them. In those books, the stories were extraordinarily creative and rich in detail and imagery. I did not find this to be true for ""Armageddon's Children"". I looked passed the few cliches used in just the first couple of pages, however the usual substance that characterizes most of Brook's works, was sadly missing. I have tried to justify my thoughts while considering the fact that this is just the first book in a new series, but unless convinced otherwise, I do not think that I will be reading any of the other books that follow this one in the series."
2,Two negatives make a positive..,"Took them out of the box and put them right to work... for about two minutes. The lower portion of the ""pump"" handle broke right off. I was using the poles to hold either end of a 2x4 to the ceiling temporarily... the cross section of the broken handle and the remaining stub show an awfully small amount of plastic was being asked to perform the most important function of the tool. The poles themselves are metal and sturdy enough, though it seemed like another design flaw that sends the pump handles up out of reach when extending the poles... now, of course, I don't really NEED to work the handles, because they're broken off.. so extending them out of reach isn't such a problem anymore. I guess the two design negatives make a positive... in a way."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"Can't decide if I like this or ""make yourself sick"" more...but this c.d. kicks ass!!!! More screaming then ""MYS"" Go buy bth c.d.'s now!!!!!"
3,Bought 2 in last 2 months,"Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I've purchased 2 in the last 2 months and they both died - I don't know how it happened but water got in the LCD display and fried it. Makes great rice but at this rate, I'd spend $1,500 a year on rice cooking. Forget it!"
2,Blogging has arrived it seems,"Well, blogging has arrived. I mean really.This book is a good example of that, one of those 101 and ""in 24 hours"" books.The subject is fun, the content is about 100 blog posts, the price for this is ridiculous.The author complains that people are writing about their lunch, but funny thing is that her 31st idea for blogging is - yes, you guessed, lunch.The book is basically about how to bare youself more to the public, how to put more of your private life on the net - hey, have you got an embarrassing memory that makes you cry and curl up? Post it!Have you got embarrassing photos? Post it!No one cares what you had for lunch, but hey, why don't you tell us what's in your purse?Blogging has arrived. And this book is one of those ""lets make some money without any effort"" books.But, if you don't mind the price - 20 USD? for this? -, you can have a good bedtime reading. And there are some good thoughts in this. Just not too many."
2,Wish it had more,I picked up this book for my daughter to help her with content for her blog. We were both unimpressed with the ideas and surprised at the lack of depth for so many of those ideas. Maybe we'll try the Blogging with Moxie book and have better results.
2,Not worth the price of the book.,For the price of the book I don't think it a worthwhile book to have.I can find a more useful one from Amazon listings.
2,"Jerry Springer, but less interesting","I've read 5 books by Moore, and this is my least favorite. Coffey is a man you just want to slap around a little for being, well, so stupid. When he turned down an actual job offer because he *thinks* he might have another one at the end of the week, I hoped he would get what he deserved. The ending of the novel made the whole story completely unbelievable."
3,Sweet but Short,"For those of us who loved Kael, having a chance to hear some of her final words is a real gift. That being said, it's important to note that the length is comparable to a padded magazine article, i.e., it's pretty short, and that part (a good part?) of the interview was published online last year on the New Yorker's website. I gobbled up the chance to read this, but I was disappointed by the brevity and by the realization I'd seen a lot of it already."
1,NO POEMS HERE!!!,"I was looking to do some reading up on poe and got the free five volumes. The fifth had all the good poems I wanted to read, or so I thought. I saw the reviews that said no poems but paid no attention. I ended up wasting kindle space. I saw it had the titles but not the content. NO CONTENT! Don't waste kindle space or time. Just pay for it."
5,usual bessey quality,"After giving into an impulse buy and getting a new piece of junk from Harbor freight that was not square, I decided to just go for the gold. This magnet is a no brainer just as they should be. It is square in both directions, all the angles are exact and the magnet is powerful. This is why I will always prefer Bessey products"
5,"this jown is off da hook, this is candy for ya speakers","this is one of the best albums i ever heard and i have alot. sean price is one of the best he brings it to ya after listening to these lyrics i was laughin'.call of the wild is the most blazin track.""i'm tall sean i got rid of the afro dat sh*t played out like dem leather jackets wit dem tassles""hahaha this is an album any rap lover should cop like a bag a cess nah mean?"
2,Pretty Blah,"This book is good for devoloping a litte more technique, but I gotta say that's about it....Example: the ""chapter"" on string bending is like one lick over and over again with some subtle differences. The same goes for the other chapters. They never go really in depth or give you a variety of playing material."
3,Good overall compilation,"This compilation has a lot of good tunes, the tracks 2 and 3 are my favorites. I think it's a good CD for car listenning during traffic jams or for parties."
4,Betty Crockers Diabetes Cookbook,For some reason this book was not quite like I expected. But I like it. It was in excellent condition and the packaging was excellent. Your part was done very well.
4,Good and Informative Diabetic Cookbook,"This is the only one out of three Diabetic Cookbooks I bought which I really like. It has just about the right amount of pictures and some good information on Diabetes. Some of the recipes look so good. I could almost taste them by looking at their pictures. Now, wouldn't that be nice if was true. It sure would save me a bunch of time cooking and cleaning up! Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone who has recently gotten the diagnosis of Diabetes. I also recommend this to anyone who has had Diabetes for a while and is getting really sick of cooking the same ol' dishes over and over. I, too, recommended this book to anyone who is wanting to start a weight-loss plan. As I believe to be true, the Diabetic diet is the best diet one can go on and keep their blood sugar levels from spiraling out of control."
2,For cooks with lots of time only,"The title of the book claimed ""Easy as 1-2-3."" I think that meant if you love to cook & like spending time in the kitchen. I don't & that's why I ordered the book. The lists of ingredients are quite long, & the number of steps needed to complete each recipe were too many. Also, there were far too many ingredients that are unavailable in my area. For meals that are truly ""everyday"" & ""easy as 1-2-3"" I bought Gooseberry's ""Super Fast Slow Cooking -- 5 Ingredients or Less,"" & I also went to Sparkpeople.com & found lots of easy, low-fat, healthy recipes in their ""Sparkrecipes.com"" site. Unless you think cooking is a fun way to spend lots of time, I can't recommend this book."
2,Don't waste your money,"My husband is diabetic, and a meat-and-potatoes guy. Doesn't like anything ethnic or un-American (his words). So, this cookbook didn't really help us. It is full of recipes that include ingredients that are hard to find, not to mention time-consuming to prepare. I have two children in the house also, and they couldn't find one recipe in this cookbook that they would like me to prepare. It is full of information for diabetics, and I do like the color recipe pictures (that's why I gave it two stars), but otherwise, it just wasn't do-able for people who don't have much time on their hands and are dealing with pretty finicky eaters."
2,ok but not what I was looking for,I was hoping for more recipes for the average household trying to getdiabetes under control. I would not recommend this unless you can afford to buy off the wall products you don't normally keep in your house
4,yes,I have tried several recipes and love the tips included. So far the recipes look like the pictures provided and I don't have to try and count the carbs in them.
2,alarm function,"I had expected this to be a rooster alarm. It isn't, and the ad failed to mention this. Very unhappy about that."
1,ROTTWEILER IS A REAL DOG,"Director Brian Yuzna must have been on some kind of hallucinogen when he signed on for this dog of a movie. ROTTWEILER is filled with so much artistic nonsense and such bad acting it's a wonder it managed to get filmed at all. The mechanized Rottweiler is really little more than a murder weapon and has little to do with the movie's so-called plot. Set in some kind of apocalyptic future, the movie focuses on a prisoner who escapes and is out to find the girl he abandoned. Flashbacks try to fill in the plot's numerous holes, but it's all so confusing and improbable, the movie dies in the first reel. Avoid unless you really like bad horror movies..and I mean bad."
1,This may very well be the dumbest movie............ ever!!!,It's kinda like The Ring movie Ya know if you watch it youll die.Well you wont die from watching it but I garinty you will become dumber....see I cant even spell anymore!!I have been raeding encyclopedia's like crazy and I still can't Un-dumb myself.I would rather have someone kick my face into a running lawnmower blade than EVER watch this movie again.Screw war.We could take over the planet in a matter of months if we flooded other countries with this movie.They would become so dumb they would forget they hated us and would have no clue how to operate any weopon system what so ever.when I am on my death bed the thing I will remember most is the whole 1 1/2 hrs of life I lost watching this movie that I will never get back!! GOD please forgive my soul for using the precious gift of time to watch something so..so.....so.....so......so .......dumb!!
3,"OK, but could be updated some...","I've owned this DVD for a couple years now (this one, and the second one of the series) because they've been available through Fawnia Mondey's website for a very long time, although they look like they've been repackaged for Amazon. From what another reviewer said, I can assume that the DVD itself is the same: set in a clothing shop, not many tricks, etc. The intruction for pole tricks isn't bad, it's just a little too easy for me. There really weren't many pole tricks at all- a lot of info on covering ground/travelling across a stage, and other stuff. I do like her sequence on stretching for extreme flexibility, as it only helps make you a better, stronger poledancer. The additional advice about what to wear & when to actually strip I personally don't like, but that's probably because I got into this for fitness, not for stripping. It felt a little cheesy to me. I'm currently checking out other DVD options for poledance tricks."
5,Best Out There,"This is been by far the best DVD I have seen on Pole Dancing. Very Easy, slow paced, slow music. Hey, I'm a beginner, I want it easy! This was great to learn by. If you are super advanced it's not for you."
1,Not helpful,"This DVD was not what I expected, she was a good teacher but the advanced moves are pretty basic and it don't teach many swings. Waste of money"
2,Afro EZ listening,"Music to put you to sleep. No lyric translations, so emotional impact of song's meaning is lost."
2,Don't be fooled!,"Some educational software is held to very low standards andthis definitely falls in that category. When I chose this CDbased on the brand name, I thought that it was a safe decision.Instead, it was a complete waste of money. The content is easilyavailable from any public library.More creative content is to befound on the world wide web and doesn't cost a thing!"
1,Nice looking but mechanically flawed,The Cuisinart Factory-Reconditioned Cuisinart TOB-30BCFR Classic Toaster Oven Broiler looked good but when the stove got hot (when being used) the door would be stuck closed. So it was not possible to remove the food until the oven cooled down. The food of course would cool down too. I returned this item here and was disappointed that I was only given a credit of about 66% of what I paid. I do not recommend this oven because this defect made it unusable.
5,west coast blues goes to another level,"road to rio is the best album of 2006.not just blues album,but,of any genre this 2 cd is a milestone in the evolution of bluesas the bedrock for all other american styles of music.the blueflames cd ads an edge to there music not yet tread upon.the livefats cd defies description.having known fats during the wonderbread years in the 1970's on and having been close friendswith Al blake for 40 years this cd makes the hair stand up onmy whole body.don't miss this blockbuster 2cd set."
5,This man's life is summed up in one word: WOW!!!!,"when i started reading, ""BROTHER RAY"" i knew i was in for a treat. This man has lived a life that was worthy of a movie. this autobigraphy had me jaw dropped and blushing. one thing, Ray Charles was definitely something else. His music was his lifeblood and the women was his pulse. the heroin abuse was something he wanted to do and eventually stopped doing. the book was raw, honest, and to the point. you felt his passions, his hurt, his triumphs and his downfall. i loved every juicy tidbit of this book. it's the kind of book that had you thinking about it days after you have read it and you talk about it with your friends and family (my cousin told me i have become obsessed with Ray Charles!) all i know is that i want to read it again. i'm gonna give my self a few weeks and i'm going to give it a second read. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
5,Reality Check,"I am not saying ALL, but MOST women want to venture out like Mary Ann did. This book was an opener, if anything. It showed, proved that women can have men as men have women .. at their fingertips. Jumping when we say jump and asking us, ""how high?"".I recommend this book for all who seek 'answers' or have 'questions' about being sexually, emotionally free ... or staying 'bonded' ..."
3,Only My Opinion.......,But I feel ZANE is losing her touch the story was cute but more for a teenager. I don't feel adults do some of the idiotic things ZANE was trying to suggest. I mean I love her style but I feel that I would be lying if I said wow ZANE is getting better when in fact she is slipping. Not that I am giving up on her but this book was to simple for any adult.
4,I liked it BUT,she has way better books than this.... it was a good read. It started out really good..I just thught that the ending was a little weak I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER...
4,Soror-MT (that's how you leave them),"Zane has once again ""done the damn thang!"" I will tell you this much, the book is all that and then some more. For the ""haters"" here's another one for you to ""hate"" on. However for those of us that appreciate Zane, this book is funny and will have you saying ""bring on the next one."" I love it. I await NERVOUS."
5,Good Reads,"...Two hours later...done. I could NOT put this book down, and when I finished it I wanted more! This was an awesome book, a must have for all who enjoy reading books of this genre."
4,Not Your Ordinary Sorors,Although the Sex Chronicles is my FAVORITE ZANE BOOK OF ALL TIME the Sisters of APF was a quick read for me...a day and a half. I couldn't put it down. Mary Ann is a young woman who had to find herself sexually but gained her independence as a young woman as well. Looking at the slang the characters were using reminded me of the things my friends and I said in the 90s but it was good book.Another good book by Zane!!!!
5,GREAT,It was great I couldnt get out of the book every chapter was thrilling from begining to end. I would read it over and over.
5,Very good book!,"Blood Father is a well crafted crime drama the reads like the front page of your local paper. Not too tough to follow but very engaging. First heard of Peter Craig when I found Hot Plastic on the book shelf and gave it a whirl.....WOW, what a good book, I thought how can you follow that? Well he delivers once again with Blood Father! You will not be disapointed with this one. He also comes from a talented family, Sally Field being his mother and his brother Eli Craig just released a very funny film ""Tucker & Dale VS Evil""."
4,Train for Results Maximise the impact of training Through Re,"I have been a training professional for over 15 years and have trained across many different industries. The biggest challange trainers face is sustainable results after candidates leave the training room. This book gives a new and insightful dimension on how to produce continous results through review. For any one sick of the same old same old ideas, this book is a must have in any trainers or managers toolkit."
4,Two very nice late nite make-out albums on 1 CD!,"These 2 very lush Julie London LP's are combined on one CD. Londin sticks mostly to jazz standards, and sounds very appealing on both sessions. Highly recommended."
5,Light bulb review,"The bulbs were impossible to find in the Boston area, so by looking on Amazon I found tham at a great price. The only glitch was shipping. I received an e-mail that they would be sent via FEDEX and given a tracking number. Unfortunately, they were actually sent by UPS and it took about two weeks to receive tham."
1,THIS SUCKS,"SO FAR THIER IS NO NUMBER FOR SUPPOERT, PIECES ARE MISSING THE SPEAKERS DON'T WORK AND THE STANDS ARE CROOKED."
4,Good Christmas Gift for Vegetarians,"I gave this to my son and daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift, they are vegetarians, and they really liked the cookbook."
1,Harriet Tubman would have kicked her in the you know what,I am so glad this woman wasn't born during slavery time -- no slaves would have escaped because she would have certainly turned them in. I am embarrassed for her.
5,Great book! Interesting subject!,"As a bass player was looking for a little help with playing unknown tunes ""on the fly"". A lot of times my trio will have guest vocalists or instrumentalists sit in requesting songs we've never rehearsed, or my keyboard player will call out tunes I don't know.This is just one more avenue of playing by ear and feel beyond improv trying to lay down a good foundation.Over the years I have done many transcriptions and memorized and analyzed many melodies and those methods just aren't working for me.Thought I'd explore another avenue. Also learning keyboards and incorporating this book's chord changes and examples into that journey."
4,A great sequel,"The sequel to the first, Hungry Eyes, is almost as good as the first. It's addictive, thrilling, and well written. The characters are strong and easily latched on to (except Shara gets on my nerves a little at times.) A lot happens, and the ending was an incredible finish. An excellent sequel to Hungry Eyes, if you were left wanting more -- this is a great runner up. Even as a stand alone book, Eyes of Prey is a great read with a multitude of social commentaries."
2,Can anyone be nominated for a Stoker Award?,"Ouch! First reviewer.Mr. Hoffman created some wonderful characters in this novel. It is the characters alone that get the two stars. I wanted to care about them in this story. I really did. However . . .In his Author's Afterword, Mr. Hoffman states that he wanted this to be a stand-alone novel. In a way I guess it is. I did not read Hungry Eyes, so many of the returning characters were most probably fleshed out in that novel. It was like walking in on a movie that's about a third of the way in.I also feel that the term 'horror' on the book's spine is a misnomer. 'Suspense' would be more apt.Eyes of Prey is a quick read. Again, I'm just a little disappointed that there wasn't more for these wonderful characters to do.I'm sure Mr. Hoffman has an idea where the story arc is going. Perhaps when all four installments are in place, I can look at the whole story in a different light and rate it a bit higher."
5,Stopping Power,"This book seeks to train the mind with the following principle: ""It's not the force of the blow that matters, but where you place it."" This also applies to firearms shooting, as Mashiro demonstrates. The ""stopping power"" of a bullet has a lot less to do with the caliber and muzzle velocity than with where you place it. The body has certain vulnerable areas that can be exploited and attacked with remarkable success. This book should be read twenty times by anyone wishing to prepare him/herself for a violent encounter."
5,Amazing guitar playing and wonderful deep voice,"When I first listened to this CD, I thought it was good, but it just keeps getting better and better. Although some of the songs definitely have country-ish overtones(not my favorite kind of music), the ones I like the best -Pray The Dawn, I Can't Stop Bleeding, I Don't Know You Anymore, Is Anybody Dreaming, No Chicane, and Hide are more bluesy-rock with great bass, electic and acoustic guitar music. Grant also has a deep, sexy voice that a pleasure to listen to. The song lyrics aren't exactly upbeat but they're not depressing either. I rated the CD 5-stars because while there are a few songs on it that I don't care for, the others are so good that the CD should get some notice. Grant plays all the guitars and has some really good musicians and backing singers(mostly Capercaillie-connected, but this is NOT a traditional folk album)working with him."
3,Where is ROBO TRUMBLE?,"Love The Simpsons; always have. Like a lot of people on here, I'm not a fan of the new dvd packaging. But what I'm more concerned about now is what is potentially missing from the shows themselves. I enjoy season 15, and one of my favorite episodes is the Battlebots spoof, ""I (annoyed grunt) Bot,"" also known as ""I D'oh Bot."" There is a great joke about the name of their fictitious show, ""Robot Rumble,"" wherein the show's announcer says, ""And now back to Robo Trumble.... I'm sorry, that's Robot Rumble."" I remember it very clearly from the original broadcast, and after some research online, I've found that a lot of other fans remember it fondly as well. Unfortunately this great one-liner is missing from the dvd set! I watched the episode several times just to see if I missed it (and all the deleted scenes as well), and it is nowhere to be found. So if memorable little nuggets like this are missing, one has to wonder, what else is missing from these seasons??"
1,One of the worst books I've read!,"This book is by far one of the worst books I've ever read. There are so many twists and turns, and so convoluted that it just gets annoying. I couldn't even finish it, and couldn't wait to delete it. I've read bad books before, but I normally finish them. This beyond disappointing. The relationship between the so-called hero and his step-mother is absolutely disgusting. There are just too many things that don't need to be in the book,and up to the point where I stopped reading, the idiot heroine hadn't even bothered to read more than small snippets of her father's journals. It seems to me that a person who is just finding out about a parent, and what she was told and read before she journied to his home, the first thing she would have wanted to do was learn about her father and the strange stipulations of his will. It's all just too 'out there' to even be remotely plausible. Don't waste your money on this one even if it is only two bucks!"
5,One of my old time favorites!,"While I haven't yet read my Kindle edition of this book, I read it several times years ago. It was one of my favorite love stories complete with plenty of sex and lots of action! I will be reading it again, on my Kindle this time, in the near future."
5,Great Early New Orleans/Chicago-Style Jazz,"This is not what people call ""jazz"" today. This is the REAL stuff where each man takes his turn in the ensemble; steady beat, gut-bucket old-timey delightful jazz. The few vocals are a joy; not singers, but musicians singing. You'll tap your feet and be transported as only this kind of music can do. A real treat and it gets to me every time I play it (which is often!). Buy it. You'll thank yourself many times."
1,Broke within 1 month,Wire became loose at the plug and they don't work after a month of use. Maybe it's time to invest in some good ones.
2,Not that great,The action is not very believable. Its hard to believe that young people even today would do some of the things she does.
4,Interesting,"Interesting philosophical view of magic and the world for a fantasy novel. Not a gripping thriller, but easy to read, if not exactly easy to grasp 100%."
2,don't bother,"i saw no results from this product,but maybe if you work at it long enough something would happen."
2,Health Economics 4th ed,Click to look inside might have ensured no information asymmetry. Unfortunately I was not able to maximise my utility after reading through this book and felt it was poor value for money. I think it is a substitutable good and there are better texts available on the topic.
1,Boring.,I was disappointed in this book in that it covers virtually unknown and/or extremely obscure Saints of which little is known. Put this book next to your night stand - you'll be asleep before the second page.
1,SACRO WEDGY - The Back Aid Sacro Stabilizer - MALE...,SACRO WEDGY - The Back Aid Sacro Stabilizer - MALE... do not work problems still exquisite item is not what it seems.lost money again
2,not worth the money,This is a cheap piece of foam and it did nothing for my sciatica or lower back problem. I really wished it had work but it doe not. Save your money.
3,It helps but is no Inversion Therapy,This device does help to square you up but it does not compare to the help I get from an inversion table.
1,doesn't work .. waste of money,I took this product as instructed and I didn't lose not even one pound . I exercise and eat very healthy.. also it gave me a very bad heart burn .. waste of money
2,"Didn't fit properly, cheap","This didn't fit my Subaru Impreza 2008 2.5i properly, thought Amazon claimed it did. There is supposed to be a tight fit, but this one could move slightly left and right, and this movement created a vibration in the car to produce a very annoying noise while driving. I got a more expensive K&N; 33-2304 Replacement Air Filter but the noise is gone.K&N; 33-2304 Replacement Air Filter"
5,the most original cd I've ever heard!,"Very hard to put into words.If you have not been privileged enoughed to hear it, then don't denie yourself any longer. One of the best cds I've ever heard."
3,not bad...,"one of the girls was listening to this album on her last day of work knowing that ana and i have had our moments, little did i know she forgot it there. i was lucky enough to find it last night, so i decided to take it home and give it a spin. ana has a lovely voice. very sweet. the music isnt bad, either. it doesnt really suit my personal taste, but im surprised this album didnt do better than it seems to have. i probably wouldve been into in grade school. i think ""cute"" describes the album pretty well. id definitely give this cd (minus a track or two) to my child if i had one."
4,"Well written, but far-fetched!","Rather than resulting in a well-trained and submissive slave, we get an unwilling participant who appears to need hospitalization rather than punishment. Extreme in the physical and not written well enough to get into the emotions (other than anger and fear) bet we really never get into the head of Caroline. Could have been a lot longer book. The ending is lame in that it leaves the reader hanging... ""so what happened?"" An easy read in one sitting."
3,enjoyable reading,It was a word for word copy of the first few chapters from Paul Little's book Sentenced to Servitude.
3,A contemporary take on classic sounds,"It sounds like Carpenters meet Bangles meet Evanescence. I don't mean it in a bad way, but simply as a descriptive one. It's got a great sound and good vocal arrangements, but despite this it lacks a signature song that takes the album forward. Good for studying or while fixing things around the house."
4,Good for digital video editors,"I'm not completely crazy about the little punch buttons, since it's too hard to remember which button does what, but the jog/shuttle wheel is great."
2,Shuttle Pro,I seems to be a great product but it only works with earlier versions of Sony Vegas software. It doesn't work in Ver. 8.1
2,I regret buying this book.,"I went looking for a book about prision reform in order to learn more about the subject. What I found in this book was a poorly organized, lop-sided, rambling diatribe. The problem of prison reform is not easily solved by society stopping being mean to the poor prisioners - which is what this book seemed to me to suggest. This book does a fair job of showing some of the extreme excesses that does occur in our prison system - but while I believe the extremes are important to know about - the book does an awful job describing the normal life of a prisioner. The book mentions problem such problems as lack of counseling, education or what happens on parole - but spends far too little time on these topics . Instead it prefers to spend way too much time on isolated and dramatic cases of abuse.Prison reform is an important topic - but this book won't give you a balanced view."
2,Definitely not the right color,"If you order ""studio grey,"" you obviously don't want ""pearl grey"" when you open the box. The pearl grey is MUCH lighter than what is in this image. It's like a dirty white.Note: I couldn't return this because I desperately needed a grey at the customer's request."
4,Another Satisfying Haig,"This time our boy finds himself lent out to a private firm as part of a newish JAG program. Reunited with a character from one of his earlier novels, sparks may be about to fly, when instead, fate rears its ugly head, and Sean (yes, we're close enough that I'm on a first name basis with him) finds himself in the middle of yet another mystery. This one has less law (which I missed) and more action (which continues to be done well and realistically) than his earlier works. As with all of Haig's novels I've read to date (I'm currently on number five) the action is continuous, and just as many books would be winding down I'm still on the edge of my seat, rarely ahead of Sean, and enjoying watching the always multiple and varied webs untangle. The lead character is a bit too self-effacing at times (sometimes seriously so, at other times as a back-handed compliment to self), but not so much so that even after powering through four in a series I've tired of it."
5,Sean Drummond is back at it again!,"Major Sean Drummond has become one of my favorite fictional characters. In his latest adventure, Drummond is sent to work in a private law firm through a military program that sends its officers into the private sector to ensure they are exposed to the latest in the private practice of the law. This book differs from the previous novels in that it takes place solely in the United States (as compared to Russia, Korea, and Serbia). However, the lack of an exotic foreign location does not take away from the wit and action that I have come to expect from Brian Haig. Soon, Drummond is involved in the investigation of the murder of an old colleague which, of course, leads to a much bigger conspiracy that Drummond never saw coming. A great read!"
5,Excellent,"The series featuring Sean Drummond, the Army attorney, continues. Drummond, is a likeable and believable hero. In this story he is loaned to a white shoe civilian law firm as part of an exchange program with the military. The private law firm has people involved with a crime syndicate that is involved with suspect dealings with a communications company. The brutal murders designed to cover up the tracks begin. There is high level involvement with the FBI and CIA. This is a real page turner!"
3,Pages taken from a pre-pubescent locker room,"I have read a good number of Mr. Haig's Drummond series, and they are generally interesting with seemingly good research, interesting characters, and plots. This work falls right in line (though certainly not the best), but it does sink to new levels of ""potty-pen"". When you cannot find the words, resorting to typing what you find written on the stalls in a pre-pubescent boys' locker room is not an elegant solution. Not expecting the Queen's English, but also not expecting the gutter talk spread throughout."
3,Nice book if you have the resources...,"This is a beautiful book that will inspire you to create. The only problem is that it seems like you need to have a lot of materials to create these projects. There are really only TWO of these that I would find myself making: The travel altar and the chakra bracelet. These are two of the simplest ones. I would love to make the smudge pots, but you have to build your own kiln if you don't have one available. Then a few of the other projects you need a sewing machine for. Then on a few of the other ones you have to use a saw, drills and some lumber. This may appeal to some, but for those of us on budgets and looking for some simple projects, you won't really find it here!"
5,"What is ""quality""?","This is a great little CD. Comparisons to other Merritt works are inevitable, but I'm disappointed at the harshness of some of the criticism here. One reviewer slagged the female singers and one said he had no interest in checking out Odetta. If ""Waltzing Me All the Way Home"" doesn't break your heart, I question your humanity. This is one of my favorite songs by anyone anywhere at any time; no silky smooth singer could have done it justice."
2,"big stephin fan, big let down...","Now I am a huge Stephin Merrit fan, and of course, once the doors opened at my local little indie record shop I was there to buy the new sixths album. Well, I got home put it on, and seriously felt like crying. I was even more upset when I realized that Stephin didn't even sing 1 song on here, like the previous Sixths album. I have heard most of these songs in concert and they were marvelous, so you can imagine how disappointed I was. Even Gary Numan & Marc Almond don't sound good. Why on earth does Stephin pick the lousiest female singers? I couldn't tell you, but I swear I was listening to a bunch of Transvestites trying to use their girly voices. I wouldn't keep this cd if it wasn't made by Stephin. My advice is to go to a Magnetic Fields show and record it, so you can have Stephin singing these tunes."
4,Mailbox,"I have a preschool program. This mailbox added a realistic element to our dramatic play areaAfter visiting the post office, children took turns being mail carrier while everyone wrote letters,stamped and mailed those letters adding an important literacy building activity."
3,It's okay,Okay but not the most fascinating show around. I know I won't ever eat any kind of crab caught in this fashion so maybe it is bad for their business
5,Incredible,This series really gives you something to think about when you sit down at the table to enjoy some delicious Alaskan King Crab legs. mmmmm.
2,Something is lacking,"Mortification didn't quite cut it this time. I'm sad to say that this album is probably one of their worst releases as far as musicianship and recording is considered. Triumph of Mercy is a power/thrash blend with a hint of grind. The over-all sound is lacking a punch, the recording could've been better and there wasn't much variety in the musical scores. Despite poor production, the lyrics, as is Mortification's trademark, are full of encourgement. Unless you are a die-hard Mortifcation fan, you can probably pass this one up without feeling like you have missed something.El Kabong gives it three head bangs."
5,"Description states ""many phrases"" but there are only 2!!","Description states ""many phrases"" but there are only 2!! It is cool that they use his actual voice!"
5,2gether,This is the best CD ever. It is definetly worth buying and all the songs on this album are great. Rest In peace Michael
1,No Good!,"This album was horrible! A total disappointment! Their failed attempt at humor wows me, and their songs are unbearable."
4,I Know the Destroys My Credibility....,"Ok, first of all I am not some little girl who hates 2Gether because they're fake and cuss and ""doesn't get it."" I am a dude to the fullest extent, but I have some love for this album. The lyrics work on so many levels-parody (sappier than sap) humor (laugh-out-loud lines and whacked-out choruses) and craziness (not necesarrily funny, but too absurd to be bought by any air-headed valley girl). I can't say they're so good that they almost verge on self-parody, because the fact is they self-parody themselves! They're out to get everyone (not in a Puff Daddy sort of way though) and so far this album exceeds any garbage pop out there. In fact, this is the only pop I enjoy, much less actually bought. So rag on me for liking this and not your almighty (fill in your favorite arty, tries-too-hard-artist) but the fact is, this disc is full of oodles and oodles of fun... And surprisingly, it's listenable as a REAL album..."
5,Mania Mania - I've got it,This is a great approach to Mecha. It covers all the themes of Mecha and the artwork is instructional and entertaining at the same time. Definitely a must buy for any fan of Mecha.
3,Decent details.,"I like the details inlcuded in this book, like the logicparts. An example would be, how does the pilot enter the mecha,or how the cockpit looks like, or what the suit should look likeand so on...His style though, is only moderate, and if you really REALLYwant to learn to draw robots, you should takea look at ""How To Draw Manga - Giant Robots"" by Hikaru Hayashi.Having both books can give you an excellent insight on the genre,and lets you make your own style, because that's what it's allabout!"
5,Great Purchase!,"Great product and really easy install. I installed this kit in about 30 minutes and the results were spectacular! I mainly wanted the kit for the sound and i seen videos on how it sounded so i wasnt sure, but when you hear it in person it is so worth it! The car seems so much more responsive to. I would recommend this purchase to anyone who is looking for a small upgrade for their vehicle. Very good product!"
3,"My three year old loved these two, until...","she dropped the dad portion of this duo on the sidewalk and his arm broke off. He's now missing a portion of his arm from the elbow to the hand. I was unable to glue it back on and my daughter was devastated. On closer inspection, I realized that the dad's head was falling off also and when I thought about it, I realized that the head had been coming loose (at the neck) for a while. I don't think this doll was well made at all. Furthermore, the hair on this guy has actual glue in it or some other sticky stuff that has hardened. It's kind of gross."
1,hate it,i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove. i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy.
5,Better than expected,"After doing an enormous amount of research (this is my 4th fryer) I decided on the Waring DF200 Professional Deep Fryer and I'm glad I did. It heats up quickly, is true to its dial-in temperature (tested by thermometer: 375 on dial was 380-ish actual; 335 was true), clean-up is made easy, and it did a great job. The only caveat is that I thought it would hold a larger (read huge) amount of food and was surprised at the food vs. oil quantity; none the less, I am VERY pleased."

2,Odd collection of essays.,"Most of these essays are very run-of-the-mill rants about racism, sexism, and plastic surgery. There are a few gems like Orwell's ""The Hanging"" (a subtle piece that exposes the injustices of capital punishment), and ""Lost at C"" by Jean Shepard. There are also some plain stupid ones like ""The Travels of an Onion"" and ""Neat People versus Sloppy People"" which are simply unnecessary.I see the need for colleges to teach students about racial inequalities and cultural differences, but bad writing is unforgivable."
4,Creative Guide to Research,"Chock full of details about search engines. If you are a writer,journalist or film maker this might be a good book for you. Reading it will definitely enhance your internet research skills. Although the author does give an overview, if you want detailed information about searching in libraries or archives this is not the book for you."
5,HEIDEGGER REVIEW BY TONY SEE,"This is a good place to start if you are interested in getting an overview of Heidegger's writings. There are some obvious disadvantages such as the fact that some parts are included while others are not, but what is inside is generally good enough as a starting point for Heidegger's other writings.I would recommend reading the other translations though such as the Pathways, Parmenides and Language and Thought if one is already serious about Heidegger studies as these have the important writings as well and in complete form.There are some Heideggerian writings that are especially relevant to life in Singapore and perhaps to other urban and technological cities as well and the student of philosophy may want to see how everything fits together in the works on art and technology.Tony SeePhilosopher in Residence(Singapore)"
4,exact fit,This battery is an exact replacement for my Makita drill and performs as good or better than the original.
3,Not bad,"I've never seen a Care Bears cartoon until now other than one of the modern CGI movies (which made me want to vomit) but I was expecting them to be better, not to say they were bad. On the contrary, I'll be renting another disc.This was pure 80's which meant there were goods guys & bad guys, the animation was top notch (and actual animation unlike a lot of the garbage today) & it was strong on teaching morals to the viewer (something else that's completely foriegn to today's stuff). The one thing I can point to that I didn't like was the villianess Shreeky. I don't like cartoon characters who shriek & yell, teaching kids bad habits."
2,catwoman,not as described. not waterproof or smudgeproof. I bought 2 colors and both were a waste of money. The cheaper NYX brand lasted till I took it off and was much cheaper and the color was nicer.
2,Smudges,So disappointed..I thought I would not have raccoon eyes but I did after just a few hours.. so back to liquid eyeliner for me..
5,Troy Troy where for art thou,"I havent had the pleasure of reading the 1st in this series witch is probably why i was so stresed out when heaven was stuck in the mountains with logan and unable to contact her beloved troy! I wanted so much for logan to be out of the picture and Troy not to be her uncle.....its not fair!! I also think it was good that he ended up riding a horse into the sea to his aparent death so heaven could lead a normal life with a man who wouldnt give her ""DEVIL CHILDREN"" as they say in the other books. Atleast Heaven thoght he was gone and not depressed thinking of her somewhere so that is a small consilation.........until you read the next....."
4,pole saw review,"Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw, 8-Inch Bar #NPP2018..Saw was easy to use and battery life was good. had no problems through limbs up to around saucer size. nice storage case, if cutting alot suggest second battery to keep on hand. My only complaint was no self oiling system, which was no problem but you had to remember to keep oil can handy and lube often."
4,tree prunner,"I purchased the pole prunner on 9-21-08 and it does everything theproduct info said it would. The battery held its charge as it said,all though I did buy an extra battery and would recomend you doingthe same..Free shipping was less than 1 week..DS North Carolina"
3,Not Very Powerful + Leaves Get Stuck in It + A Little Unwieldy,"I charged this for about 12 hours and then used it to cut two 6""diameter branches off an oak tree. It struggled a bit but finally succeeded in cutting them. When I used it to then cut the limbs into smaller pieces, it quickly ran out of energy and I had to recharge the battery. The other thing is that the smallest branches and leaves got stuck under the housing that holds the saw blade, so I had to remove the housing and put the chain back on. Finally, the contraption is a little unwieldy just because the saw weighs more than the handle and center piece. On balance, I think this is best for smaller jobs, and cutting softer trees than oak and smaller branches than 6"". P.S. -- the item does not come with oil (that you will need for the chain) but you can buy some from Amazon."
4,It works like the others say it does.,"I use this pole saw, not for pruning, but to cut dead, dying, and nuisance growth (e.g. sumac) from the top-of-slope along one mile of roadway. I can reach down over the slope as far as I want with this tool.I have cut trees up to 5 inches in diameter, and it has sufficient power for plenty more.One tip: The replacement battery -- Fire Storm 18v -- holds its charge much longer than the packaged battery. That is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.Also purchased another charger, the FSMVC. Works well, too."
4,Nice Product,"A very nicely engineered product. Great for cutting as advertised. Very easy to assemble sections. Keeping the chain oiled & the bar greased is important. Chain and bar are very easy to remove and replace after sharpening. I would suggest having an extra charged battery on hand. It will cut a heck of a lot of small branches and 8"" sections too. The light weight is a very big plus. While in my bucket truck, cutting a branch approx. 35-ft up, the branch pinched the bar and it was stuck. I removed the battery from the base section. Tied a rope around the branch, while on the ground I pulled and tugged until the branch snapped and set the unit free. It fell from 35-ft high, landed base handle first onto the ground. I saw no damage visually of the unit. I slipped the battery back in, it started right up and has been doing great ever since. Short version: Its great to have around!"
2,Just not good quality,I bought this...used it 4 times...and it doesnt work at all. No power...terrible support...going to try and send it back
3,Black Decker 18V chain saw trimmer,This item works great when fully charged. Could use a little more batterypower and longer life. Is an excellent tool to use. It is compact and easy to use
5,Works great,"Just as advertised, This saw works great and easy to use. I Could not be more pleased with my purchase."
4,Battery op pole chainsaw,"It does a good job. It's a bit heavy at full extension - strong arms needed. The battery lasts well. Its easy to adjust chain tension, though not often needed. You must apply chain oil manually. It's a great tool for cutting branches you'd otherwise have to climb for or use a ladder."
5,B & D Cordless Pole Chain Saw,"Incredible...I've cut many oak limbs, easily, in the short time I have had this tool. The entire cordless electric tool line is a boon."
3,Pole Chainsaw,Works great for simple products. Batteries do not hold enough for more three cuts. Use only for small projects and tree limbs does not work great for anything else moderate to major. You will need a real chainsaw for that.
4,Black & Decker NPP2018 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw,"Black & Decker NPP2018 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw - works and cuts good, but takes awhile to charge. Worth the money..."
1,DOA !,"Followed instructions and charged battery (did so for 12 hrs) before use. Put together, oiled chain, pulled trigger and NOTHING. Checked connections and even put battery in charger again, but never would run. Sending back but now Amazon is out of stock so cannot get a replacement now when I need to use it."
2,average,"have been using the saw for a week. Do not share the glowing reviews. Its great for small jobs.However if you cut limbs 2 or more inches in diameter, the battery will last about 15 minutes and then then you have to wait at least 6 hours to recharge. need addition batteries to do a job other than small limbs."
5,Music to soothe the savage beast!,"The first time I heard Julius spin, he worked me out at the Winter Music Conference in Miami. He did it again here, on this compilation album. As the album cover states, and I personally attest, this album is pure musical bliss. This album of jazz inspired house music is great to groove to, or to get your groove on to (wink)! ""Love your brother, respect your sister ...,"" these, the lyrics to track 2, LOVE AND RESPECT (Joe Claussell's Spiritual Healing Mix) by Carlos Sanchez, whisper over the pulsating track. Listen for Julius working the EQ's to get you in the mood. Other tempting top tracks to check for:HAZY DAYS by Crash Connection MY FUNNY VALENTINE by Big Muff STARDUST by Crash Connection STRING SECTION by Byron BurkeFinally, my other personal favorite to look for, track 9, HARMATTAN by the Komputer Kidz. This album takes jazzy house to new heights. Music to soothe the savage beast!"
4,"Excellent starting point - signed, William Shakespeare","I agree with the other two reviewers that this work is not a comprehensive treatise on the subject of detecting forgery. However, it does give beginners (like me) a good place to start. It is clearly written and broad (if not deep) in coverage. I would call this book ""workmanlike"" and ""solid."" If I were a writer of mystery novels, this would be a good reference for this area of criminal(?) activity. The small section on the autopen especially intrigued me (hint: don't buy John F. Kennedy autographed documents). The bibliography in the back is its greatest asset if you want to pursue the topic of forgery to a deeper level. Our interlibrary loan people are going to be hustling for years as I track down some of the sources Nickell cites in this book."
1,Bollywood meets Broadway,"This movie is an exaggerated theatrical rendering of all age old Bollywood romantic formulas: boy meets girl, both meet all sorts of hurdles, then finally get together, and live happily ever after. It's a sheer waste of money and time."
2,Che un Peccato!,"For anyone who enjoyed Michael Dibdin's earlier Aurelio Zen mysteries, this one is a major disappointment. The edifice is constructed with unidimmensional bricks and thin mortar. The result is profoundly uninteresting. I forced myself to continue even when, about a third of the way through, I found myself asking, ""What is the bloody point?"" My guess is, there isn't one. I'm not surprised to see that Dibdin's latest book is ""The Last Aurelio Zen Mystery."" There is nothing in the least bit mysterious about this book and Zen---always an intriguing character---has finally morphed into a listless shadow of his former self. And even he clearly doesn't care what happens. Obviously Dibdin doesn't, either. I don't know if Dibdin's written out, or now fancies himself an oh so ""serious"" wordsmith, but I will not wait to latch onto a copy of the succeeding Zen mysteris. This one finished off what had been a pleasurable experience and left a sour taste. Che un peccato!"
4,"Aurelio battles work, murder and hypochondria","Dibdin's offbeat, addictive blend of black, madcap humor and brooding pathos fuels this latest adventure of the reluctant Italian detective Aurelio Zen. Sent to Bologna to investigate the murder of an obnoxious industrialist football-team owner, he intends to enjoy the food and the respite from his beloved Gemma who has lost patience with his perceived hypochondria (some of which will be better understood by readers of earlier books, particularly ""Cabal"").This indulgence, of course, is not to be and he soon finds himself entangled in the escapades of a rich, spoiled soccer fan and a role-playing private detective. There's also a fraudulent singing chef's feud with an Umberto Eco-style semiotics professor, an impoverished student of romance and his illegal immigrant lover, and Zen's own appetites, preoccupations and melancholy.Not the best Zen, but still a standout in the field."
3,Very disappointed,"I had every intention of buying this since I've waited so long for it to come out on DVD. After watching my favorite sketch ruined by the fact that they couldn't bother to get the license to an old Marvin Gaye song, I changed my mind. You can't do $240 worth of pudding without it. Plus, I'm pretty convinced they dubbed over the dialogue which made it worse. I'll stick to my bad quality vhs from now on."
2,Not funny - Kids In The Hall were better,"I remember seeing a few episodes in the 90's and enjoying some of the sketches. The material hasn't aged very well, and most of this just comes off as pretentious. For every ""I'm going to dip my balls in it"" sketch that is good there's at least 20 bad ones. Also, this show totally flamed out - the first 3 seasons are where all the good stuff is at, the rest is unwatchable."
3,Mediocre,"I love the Care Bears, but there's not much in this DVD to have a theme. Is a care bear ali baba scary? It was a cute complilation for someone who watched it as a child, but kids today wouldnt like it."
5,Absolutely magnificent. Full of vitality.,"Tuning a bit temperemental, but faultless recorder playing non-the-less. Wonderful vibrato Pamela. Much better in concert however. Something is lacking on CD. Your live performances are much more superior. A professional message Pam - try to detach yourself from thee music a little! Much love!"
5,DON'T HATE ON THE 5 STAR BOOK,This book was the best book that I have ever read. It would open up the hearts of all the white people who don't like black people. This man put his life on the line. He turned his self black knowing about all of the evil things that can happen to him while he was traveling through the deep South. I know ain't no white person would wanna turn themselves black just to see what it would be like. I am glad that I picked up this book. This book made tears come to my eyes. It should be in the school librarys ....
1,Truly Awful (Sorry Jeff!),"I really wanted to love this. I love Jeff Bridges and was delighted that he won the Oscar for his fabulous performance in ""Crazy Heart"". I purchased the ""Crazy Heart"" CD after seeing the movie and then made the mistake of purchasing ""Be Here Soon"". My fault, I should have listened to the samples."
1,"Love ya, love ya, love ya, Jeff........but....","Stick with acting and photography. You can take this rejection; I know it. Chin up, dear boy. Go make another (great) film!"
4,Quality product,"We loved this waffle maker. After trying to save money on cheaper models, we finally decided to buy a quality one. The waffles turned out nice and crisp instead of limp. The only drawback I saw was the lack of an audible sign the waffles were done. With just the green light to tell when they were done, the cook was forced to stay nearby to watch. As we tend to make waffles by the dozen, this was a little inconvenient. All in all though, I would recommend this product."
4,I Heart This Waffle Maker,"I bought this waffle maker for my friend and we both enjoy it. The red light/green light cooking system works well and is easy to understand. The six different settings allow you to make any kind of waffle from gooey to fluffy to dark and crispy. The non-stick surfaces make it pretty easy to get the waffles out and make it easy to clean. My only word of caution is that the metal outside does become hot when cooking, so watch your fingers and definitely supervise children. It also comes with different batter recipes. I think the heart shapes are more fun and cuter than the regular circle waffles (but what can I say, I'm a girl). I would definitely recommend this product if you want a simple, cute waffle maker that's easy to use."
1,I don't think God likes this...,"My non-christian friends were raving about this CD. I listened to it to try to relate to them on their level, but I just couldn't do it. Between the continuous stream of profanity and the flat lies he tells about our President George W. Bush, it was all the self-control I had in me to stop myself from destroying my friend's CD. There's nothing remotely funny about this CD, unless you find treason or slander humorous. Save your money and go buy some real comedy."
3,Young adult fiction,"I truly don't get the 5 star average this book gets. When a book has a lot of reviews, it seems the average rating is pretty trustworthy. Not here.This book is written at the level of a teen reader. There's nothing wrong with that -- except it's not labeled as such. It deals as much with teen angst and other school age issue -- bullying, dating, etc. as much as it deals with the superhero aspect. It's obvious that the author plans on writing more books in this universe -- because the conclusion is neither very final nor all that interesting."
2,Just So-So,"I'm going to do this as two separate ratings, i.e. Disc 1 and Disc 2. Disc 1 started out promising, but I'll have to say the first two tracks are the best; after that, it's downhill. All the way. Whenever I think of Masterbeat, I'm thinking I'll hear some music that will make me want to move. I guess I did here; it just moved me right on to the bathroom... RATING: 1 1/2 starsDisc 2 wasn't much better. I found the latter tracks a little more palatable than the first of the CD--but not by much. RATING: 2 stars. OVERALL rating (really) 1-1/2 stars. I was pretty much disappointed here."
4,Trading on my level,This book is written in a very easy to understand way. My only criticism is there is too much space in the book devoted to success stories and not enough teaching strategies.
2,Too much fluff.,"This book lacks any real substance. I was hoping to have sample systems used by trend-followers, but all you get are statistics about how ""if you had invested X dollars using trend-follower's (Bill Dunn, John W. Henry, etc...) system you would have an amazing Y dollars today!"" You learn that trend-followers made their millions following trends (honestly that's about as deep is it gets). You mostly get figures showing that you want to get into an equity in the middle part of the up/down trend and buy/sell when the trend turns (duh). That's great that these guys made plenty of money using trend-following, but that does not help me understand how they do it. I would certainly look elsewhere for trend-following information."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book is mainly a series of discussions on many people that have used trends for investment purposes. It has some interesting interviews,What I wanted was a book that explained the theory and how it worked."
2,"A lot of hype, but not enough useful material","I really believe in trend following - I use this strategy. I bought this book with an expectation of gaining more knowledge about the strategy. After I read it, I can honestly say that it gave me nothing but an overview of the greatest trend followers. Actually, I should have known that before hand, since the title of the book is ""How Great Traders Make...."", it does not say ""How YOU can make..."".So, if you are looking for ""trend following"" know-how, you will not get it from this book. You can learn a lot more by reading the ""trending"" tutorial on the clearstation."
2,Autobahn Accident,"I really just sometimes glance at a bargain bin for some good computer games. Yet, there are just a bundle for the P.C. that can be just a crashing bore. Autobahn Total for the P.C. is one for the wrecking ball. This game is arguably not that challenging. In the game you have only two game modes, a time trial mode, and a duel method where you're playing against a clone. Arguably, even though the graphics are great, there really isn't that much to make it remain a constant. You only get your choice of just two different models of cars, and try to roll your way to the top. I really thought this game was fun at first, but it doesn't flex very well.Graphics: BSound: C+Control: CPrice: C 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: D+Overall: D"
4,The Last one you'll need to read in the series,"If you have been reading the series as I have, you can stop after this book. It is as good as the first three: How to Murder a Millionaire, Dead Girls Don't Wear Diamonds and Some Like it Leathal. This book runs in the same vein. HOWEVER, from here on out the books are repetitious, the plots are plodding, the sisters lack depth and the romance betweeen Nora and Mick is on in one book, then off in the next and then on again in the next and so on. The characters never develop from now on beyond what they are here. Its like the formula for cozy mystery stagnates in the authors' writing and she doesn't know how to give more substance to either the characters or the mysteries. So enjoy this book, but forget about the rest; Have Your Cake and Kill him Too, A Crazy Little Thing Called Death or Murder Melts in You Mouth."
5,awsome toy,"this is the BEST bad guy toy i have ever seen. he is very big, but he is proportional to the other 6"" toys. he says 4 great phrases, and his fingers on his right hand come off, like in the movie. he comes with extra rings for people like me who tend to lose things. i would recomend this toy for any lotr collector or anyone who likes the bad guys. i enjoy this toy and i think most others would too. five stars is not good enough for this toy."
5,Wonderful Detail,Toybiz did a great job scuplting the Sauron action figure. The detail in the armor is fantastic. Sauron is also an electronic toy and speaks four phrases from the movie.Great toy fun all around for the kid and the collector.
3,I want my Sauron Now!!!,"I went to Toys R Us and got A 12"" Sauron.I got home and really liked it.The three problems were that the Ring was small and could get lost.Another problem was that the cape is sort of torn.The last problem was that I got a 12"" Frodo,Aragorn,and Legolas and they were all big as Sauron.This a cool toy.It has four phases to say.No Lord of the Rings 12"" collection is complete without a 12"" Electronic Sauron."
3,Post-Bolsa Depression,"No matter that I've gone through these letdowns many, many times; I'm always taken by surprise when an inarguable masterpiece is followed by a pleasant but ultimately disappointing effort. Where 'Bolsa de Agua' twisted and juked, 'Cow Fish Fowl or Pig' just sits and waits. While on 'Bolsa' the diverse songwriting talents of Kev Russell, Jimmy Smith, and Max Johnston synergized into an organic and astonishing whole, on 'CFFoP' the seams start to show. There is one great one here: 'Ceiling's Leaking', as cryptic and compelling as 'Layin Around the House' (though both need to be seen live to be believed). It's too well crafted to be deemed a total loss, and too listenable to be pardoned as a failed experiment. You'll probably like it, but it won't change your life."
4,Real close.....,"The product got real close to fixing the problem. It's much better now but did not completely make the shudder go away. However, I'll buy the product again."
4,I liked Tangerman's half of the book (I'm not a horse carver),"Zimmermen's chapters devoted to horse carving cover just about every aspect of that art. In fact, it's more than I want to know about it, since I'm not that interested in that subject. If you are, you'll be in heaven.But the other half of the book, Tangerman's, present a lot of diverse subjects, styles, examples and tips.It is NOT a 'how-to' book in the sense that it does not give the reader a project and a list of illustrated steps to complete the project. It's much more general in approach. So if you want such a step-by-step book, you should look elsewhere. But I always find Tangerman a great source of woodcarving wit and wisdom, and in this book has plenty of that."
4,DOUBLE READER,"IF YOU LIKE READING WAR STORIES? THIS IS A MUST READ TWO TIMES KINDA BOOK! DESCRIBES THE HORRORS OF WAR. THE STORY TELLS OF MASS CONFUSION ON BOTH SIDES TO A SIDE LESS KINDA OF WAR. YOUNG AND OLD A LIKE; LIVES BEING SHATTERED IN SECONDS. LOSS OF FRIENDS AND WAR WARRIORS IN THE HOLE NEXT TO YOU. LOSS OF FAMILY TIES! BROTHERS, SISTERS, FATHERS, MOTHERS, HUSBANDS, WIVES AND KIDS. BULLETS AND BOMBS SHOW NO MERCY WHAT SO EVER! A VERY GOOD EFFORT BY THE AUTHOR IN DESCRIBING WHAT IS WHAT IN THE SANDBOX WAR. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN--A MUST READ- IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT!!"
5,Excellent Reading,I couldn't put this book down. I know very little about the Iarq war and found Tim Pritchards book to be informative and eye opening to the horrors of war. Excellent reading.
4,"Gripping, but I didn't like the style","One of the best things about this book is that Pritchard incorporates multiple points of view into the narrative (for example, the decision to attack the north bridge without tank support). Some thought it was necessary, others thought it was foolhardy. Pritchard just gives the information and lets the reader decide.But the ""omniscient narrator"" style rubbed me the wrong way. I realize that when Pritchard writes about what the Marines were thinking, he's taking that information directly from interviews he had with them after-the-fact. But sometimes it comes across like a football game where the camera shows the coach on the sidelines and the announcer says what (he presumes) the coach is thinking. I think I would have preferred to either have the individual Marines' accounts told in the first-person, or to have had Pritchard write in the first-person about what the soldiers told him in their interviews.But other than that minor complaint the book is excellent."
3,"well, I just found a problem","I have had the coffe maker for about a month now. I just noticed last night that the clock is off, and it won't reset. The coffe is great and it is an attractive coffee maker, but there seems to be some technical malfunctions in the unit."
3,Why????,"Works well but with some quirky issues. i.e.,Why in the world is the white version of this product $15 more than the black model?Also, the markings on the knobs are almost impossible to read."
3,"good book for VERY little beginner, toddler","This one for toddler's only, mostly a picture book, good for sight recognition of zoo animals."
5,The best bedtime book for infants and toddlers!,We've been reading this book to our son every night since we first found it. It's very amusing and has great illustrations. Good for children and adults.
5,My Daughter's (and Our) Favorite,"We received this book as a gift after our daughter's birth, and now that she's ten months old, it's her absolute favorite. She actually goes to her book basket, digs through the all of the books to find this one, and then brings it to us to read to her. The best part is that because the narrative is told through the pictures instead of through words, it's a different book when I read it to her than when her father, grandmother, etc. does. I'm sure that as she gets older, we'll be able to modify our reading of Good Night, Gorilla to suit her age, pointing out different things about the story than interest her now. This book is destined to be a classic!"
4,"Quick, easy reading BOARD book.","This sneaky gorilla steals the zookeepers keys. As the keeper says goodnight to all the animals, the gorilla is behind him (with his pet mouse who is dragging his banana for him) letting out all the animals so they can spend the night in the house of the keeper. Cute, colorful illustrations. Repetition of words and known animals allows this book to be an easy reader."
2,"This is a FLIMSY book, not a board book","I LOVE this book, but this is not the great toddler friendly board book. it is paperback. Find the board book and you've got a 5 star review! Our kids love to read this at night. This is a must for new parents and baby showers!"
5,Gentle and charming,"I don't quite know what my daughter (age 2 years) saw in this book, but it was her favorite for about 2 months. She wanted it read several times a night, and even slept with it. Perhaps it's the fact that the illustrations tell the story -- the few words are superfluous. She loved it so much I bought her plush toys for each of the animals. Well, actually, not the armadillo or hyena ... come to think of it, the book would probably be slightly improved by leaving out the armadillo and hyena."
3,not what i had hoped for,"I don`t think this is such a great book. Yeah, ok, funny gorilla takes the keys and lets the animals out..... There are hardly any words in the book and my daughter like it either. sorry, not a fan."
1,Avoid this,"A very poor book compared to ""Goodnight Moon"". Just mooching off the the ""good night"" kiddie book market."
5,Really cute!,"My youngest isn't the type to sit and have a book read to her (she can't sit still long enough), but she asks to have THIS book read to her 4 or 5 times a day. The illustrations are great (especially when the zookeeper's wife realizes she is no longer alone in her bedroom), and both of my kids (ages 6 and 3) get a big kick out of the gorilla. It's the perfect book for little ones: simple text, silly illustrations, and just the right size for little hands. :o)"
3,A look into the future,"This book is a compilation of short stories by different authors. What I found uniqe was the fact that all of the short stories take place on the same planet. A look at the future of AI and future applications in war. The star of the books, of course, are the Bolos. A self-aware robotic tank with a long distinguished history. Some of the story lines move to fast, so as to not be developed to my taste. But I assume that is the problem with short stories in this series...."
2,Don't waste your money,"I've used it religiously for a month and soaked my feet in warm water before use. I even wear wool socks during the night to help soften my feet. It does alleviate the drying but my feet are still callused. Anyway, I guess until I change my lifestyle and not wear heels, there really is no cure. I find that Aquaphor and coconut oil do just as good as a job doing the same routine mentioned above, if not better because you get more bang for your buck."
3,Diverse and ... ?,"I like very much Paul Davies, especially books like The Mind Of God, but this one, About Time, is hard to follow ...I feel like I am reading a collection of stories, with no obvious links to each other ... getting me feeling I don't know where the author wants to goSo when you get lost in a book, it's hard to follow.Some parts are really deep and interesting, that's why I'll read the book till the end.However, some parts are too much deep and hard to follow if you don't already have solid knowledge in:philosophy, metaphysic, history of science and history of humanity (among others, which Mr Davies obviously has)."
4,About Time,"I liked this book. When I read the first pages, I thought that I had chosen the wrong book, but afterwards everything changed. Here you can find a light and clear review of many aspects of time.It is not perfect, and some times it is not clear what the author means with ""time reversal"", etc, even if he tries to explain it several times. The theory about the proximity of Doomsday is also quite weak.In spite of this, you find a clear view of time as it is currently known by science. I have not found many new ideas, but in general they are well structured and consolidates what you have read separately in many other books. Apart from that, it has good rhythm, and it is easy to read and understand."
3,"Quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and time.","I am a big fan of prof. Davies' books, but I found that this one had not the same high standard as his other books. Some chapters were boring and gave the impression that they were written purely to expand the volume of this work.But as always, he explains clearly and understandably his subject, like such important items as the opposite direction of time's arrow in thermodynamics (downhill) and in the Darwinist evolution(uphill), or the disappearance of time in quantum mechanics.Remarkably, one of the main themes of his more compelling and recommendable book 'The 5th Miracle' is already announced here: ""Many scientists are adamant that the 'concretization' of quantum reality has nothing whatever to do with the mind, others maintain that the mystery of the 'collapse' (of the wave) and the mystery of consciousness are intimately bound up with each other."" (p. 278)I prefer the books written by G. Whitrow about 'all sorts' of times."
5,*****,This season contains some of the best snark and humor from Anthony Bourdain. Must buy for any fan!
5,Think you know it all?? then read on,"An 'Essential' insight into the world of the weimaraner,As a weimaraner owner/breeder/exhibitor I still refer to this book on a regular basis.Handy hints and tips about how your dog thinks and acts from a person who trully understands this most rewarding and demanding breed.OK so it doesn't tell you what to do every step of the way or hold your hand throughout your dog's life, but if that's what you want maybe the Weimaraner isn't for you. I find this book informative and helpful in a number of areas,Even as an 'Experienced'Weimaraner owner. So it is a must read for those serious about owning and rearing a happy healthy pet.Recommended reading for all our new puppy owners."
3,was expecting more,"Love Robert De Niro and Paul Dano, so was expecting to love this movie. Unfortunately, I only liked it. Not sure that I would recommend, other than if you want to expand your knowledge of these actors' acting repertoire."
2,Meh,"Meh. Not that great. Interesting subject matter and decent acting, so not a total waste of time. Worth watching if its on sale."
2,"DeNiro is good, but that's it","I can't say I've ever been disappointed in the way Robert DeNiro has portrayed a character. And I know this was based on a true story, but overall I didn't care for the movie. It was interesting to see DeNiro playing such a horrible bigot since I'm pretty sure he isn't that was in real life. But the movie was kind of depressing. I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,Gack.,"The problem with having a collection of something is that sometimes you wind up adding cr&p; just so the collection will be reasonably complete. Or possibly I thought this was the movie of the same name with Ving Rhames (read those product descriptions carefully, boys and girls...).But seriously, this really has nothing going for it. I'd place it in the middle of the pack of films made for lunch money by high-school drama departments."
2,One of the worst,"This movie was so bad I could not even finish watching it. I am a huge zombie movie fan, I am very dissapointed in this movie. Now I know it does not take a lot of money to make a zombie movie but this was the lowest budget looking movie I have ever seen. And I have watched alot of movies."
1,CREEPY VIDEO - ZOMBIE BABIES WITH MOVING MOUTHS,"This video is creepy and almost frightening! I had no idea these would be almost still frames of babies (that look exactly like Zombies) with super-imposed moving mouths pretending to sing a long to the songs.AND, once you barely get past that, the songs ARE mainstream songs, but the kid's voices are horribly out of tune and literally PAINFUL to listen.The video did capture my child's attention, but I'm sure, will also give them nightmares. Plus, it's not good for your kids to listen to other kids sing so badly out of tune."
5,WOW! I LIKE IT AS MUCH AS MY SON!,"Typically, I cannot stomach too many infant videos, even though my son has an endless appetite for them. However, this video is actually well-produced and entertaining to even me. Also, my son tries to sing along, claps, coos, and smiles from beginning to end. It makes my husband and me happy to see him so engaged in something. And don't even think about turning it off in the middle. We play ""Singing Babies"" so often that we will probably need a new tape soon. I rank this video in my top three favorite kid videos, and believe me, I've seen most all of them."
5,"Baby says ""YES!""","Well paced, great songs, and cute idea with the babies singing. My daughter, Nadia, is only 13 months but really has fallen for the Singing Babies. She carries the DVD case around the house with her like a security blanket. If they start a Singing Babies Fan club, Nadia should be the club president."
2,CORNY,"ALTHOUGH IT DID KEEP THE ATTENTION OF MY 5 MONTH OLD FOR A WHILE, IT WAS QUITE CORNY AND A LITTLE SCARY SOMETIMES. THE BABIES MOUTHS MOVE AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL. THEY ARE PUT IN DIFFERENT SCENES BUT LOOK VERY UNNATURAL. OF COURSE HE DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND I JUST WANTED HIM TO HEAR THE OLD TIME NURSERY RHYMES."
3,"Good , But","They should have added the hand movement. If they add it, babies will love it definitely."
3,Just so- so,"This video is just so-so in my opinion. The songs aren't bad if you are just listening, but watching it is pretty cheesy. The babies are still images with mouths that were added and big mooy eyes that blink. It is clever, but kind of creepy too. The singing babies do nothing. There are some live babies thrown into the mix on some songs, but they aren't singing. The ethnic diversity is good too, though one baby looks just like Buckwheat from the Little Rascals. He seems to be singing a good number of the songs along with a caucasion baby with a wierd looking downturned mouth.The variety of songs is good, but I think a preschool class might be nicer because it could teach some of the hand motions that go along with the sounds and make the song memrable and fun for a child.I'd pass on this. I'm sure there are better videos out there."
2,Singing Babies Nursery Rhymes,This is not really entertaining product. My son did not like this product. Image morphing also very bad. Songs are also not made with real voice.
1,Stay away from the Blueberry,"I have to admit that I love the original version of this product. I got my girlfriend one when it first came out and it was great. After the old one broke, I decided to get her a new one. As soon as the Blueberry rabbit came, the vibrate function didn't work (which is the most critical component). I called amazon and got another one shipped right away. But when the new one showed...the same thing happend. I checked all the connections I could and used 4 different sets of batteries just to make sure they weren't the problem. I sent both items back and was told there was a product defect from amazon. Then I noticed that the price had been slashed from $71.00 to $35.00. I don't know why with a defect this item is still being listed. I contacted Doc Johnson via email and have not heard anything back yet."
4,Great if you hit it just right-,"Im new to this- so take this as coming from a beginner. The toy was fun, a little loud, but what can you expect? I found that it didn't fit me just right, and took some manuevering. However, once I got it lined up just right- I was to the moon."
1,Don't do it!,"The first toy that I bought was the trinity delux rabbit and it was wonderful! So having had a good experience with the rabbit and wanting to purchase a different toy, I bought this. First of all, you cannot control the rotating shaft and the vibration power separately. Secondly, even though it has three speeds, it literally feels like it's OFF untill the third speed. Oh and the rabbit ears themselves go wayy out so that you have to hold them in, in order for them to hit your clit. I've had this less than a week and the batteries are completely dead after only a few uses. In short NOT a powerful toy, eats batteries alive, bad design, and not enough controls. Go with something else! I am very dissapointed."
1,Dont waist your money,I have had two of these break on me in 6 months. The electronics are just inferior. Don't waist your money.
2,Not a big fan,I thought my wife would like this. We have the Doc squirmy rabbit style and she loves it. But this one just did not do it for her. she said it hurt. there was a few places where some of the plastic had some sharp pieces that stuck out. plus unlike the squirmy there is only one vibrating motor in the ears (2 motors in the squirmy).the rotating beads did not do much for my wife. Sometimes simpler is better...
2,Disappointing...,"I read the reviews for this item and needed something new so I thought I'd give the i vibe a test drive. So, I purchased the toy and was very excited to try it out. There are so many problems with this toy. While the internal rotations and vibrations are fun, the item still needs more power, a LOT more power. Not to mention if you want the proper external stimulation you have to angle and hold the internal element perfectly to maintain the needed friction. Finally, the biggest disaster. While you can control internal and external speed separately, that is not so with the motion control. So, you cannot have steady vibe externally and a swirly vibe internally. Do NOT buy this product unless you are new to toys or it doesn't take more than a feather's touch for you to reach climax."
2,Stay away...,"Stay away from Doc Jonhson!! After ONLY 1 USE, the rotating beads stopped working...I paid way more than the price listed here, and I regret it so bad, I could cry!!!STAY AWAY!"
4,if this item was good or not,All I can say to this product is it's just as good as those damn expenivse ones. It has 5 speeds for vibration and turnin. Best product for personal use so far
1,Do not buy.,"Do not buy. This item is not worth your buck.If you are looking for something durable, california exotics is the best brand to go with. Decadent Indulgence 3 is the best, in my opinion."
1,Horrible,"I have owned the non water proof version of this item in the past and needed a new one. I purchased this one in the hopes that it would deliver the same wonderful results... However, not only did this item have a short that caused the bunny to do nothing, the replacement I received ALSO was faulty.I received my refund for the items and if I could give this no stars I would, it's just not worth the frustration."
1,Garbage,"The vibrating function broke after only using it twice. The reason I'm not too terribly upset is because it didn't work well as a vibrator anyway. The tiny little ""rabbit ears"" just don't cut it, and I didn't pay near the $80 you can find it for on other sites. Still, don't waste your money. It's more novelty than anything else."
1,Crap,I put the battery pack in and never got it back out. It's stuck and I broke the piece of crap trying to get it out. Didn't get one single use. Biggest waste of money in my life.
3,Soothing music just the way you think it will be,"It's what you think it will be, music that relaxes your mind and let you do things with a joyful attitude. This is great for reading, studying, or just to block out the outside noises sometimes. Some songs does tend to sound alike since it was created using the same instruments but thankfully they are good so it just feels like one big song. The volume of the music is just right as well since many relaxation music are so soft that you have to blast the volume up to hear it. Not with this one. Even if this is a good CD it doesn't dinstinguish itself from other relaxation CDs but for this low price it is a great bargain."
3,Storm in a tea cup,"Although containing obvious classic Sylvian tracks, the Weatherbox is not such a big surprise. The overinflated prices I've seen on the web are far, far from justified. There is little in the Box that adds anything significant to the instrumental sound landscapes found on, say, Gone to Earth. One might be better offer opting for the cheaper but nonetheless satisfying Everything and Nothing (which, by the way, is blessed with the simply beautiful track ""Buoy"")."
2,Very Disappointed...,"I just purchased the Kyocera Oystr today. Everything seemed to be wonderful until I downloaded two 'superphonic' ringtones for my new phone ('Snow' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 'Plush' by STP). The sound quality of these ringtones is horrible. I previously used the Audiovox 'Vox' 8610, and the exact same ringtones on the Vox sounded great. However, on the Oystr, the ringtones sound very fuzzy and garbled. On my old 'Vox' these ringtones are crystal clear. I now want to switch back to my old 8610, but I am having trouble doing so online. I only hope that I will be able to get my money back from the Oystr. The Vox may not have many special features, capabilities, or extras, but at least my ringtones sound crystal clear."
2,aloe and vinegar,NonyX works!... but this product is nothing but a combination of brown vinegar and some thickner. I found out this information on a home remedy site for foot fugus and it's true. i made my own solution with cider vinegar (white vinegar will not work) aloe & a drop or two of tea tree oil.Ethanoic acid is the prime ingredient of NonyX. Look this ingredient up on a google search if you you don't believe me. I have used NonyX in the past and always thought it smelled like vinegar it works excellent but way too expensive that's why i'm giving it 2 stars
5,Paperback trims third from hardcover collection,"Great collection -- a seamier Fitzgerald. If it's available used, consider the out-of-print 834 pg. hardcover, compiling more than 50 stories, instead of this 40-story, 500-page edition."
4,well designed...and not by the big 2 names in mice,"4.5 stars!this is a well designed, great looking mouse and once I got used to the wide scroll wheel I decided that I really liked it.what I really liked:1. wireless (wire freedom is better than you'd think)2. 800 dpi (so is mouse accuracy/precision)3. wide scroll wheel (takes about a day to get used to it)4. 2 extra buttons (programmable)5. looks awesome (designed by the BMW group)what I didn't like quite as much:1. needs batteries (they weigh it down a bit also. some gaming mice have weights for this, so it might be a desirable feature.)2. left-click is a fraction of a second less responsive than I'd like (but I'm picky.)3. needs about half a second to wake up (any wireless mouse will probably also do this, but I'm trying to be thorough)"
4,Drawing Lifelike Potraits,"I think this book was very informative, it changed my perspective on drawing life like portraits. After going through it and applying the techniques I could instantly see a difference just by using the methods of shading. It was and still is a good alternative tool to use if you are unable to actually receive proper classes. I use it as a reference while I'm drawing. I think some ability to draw is required to use and understand it.Regards,Dennis"
5,It's excellent-like all of Lee Hammond's books,Lee Hammond writes books that really teach you to draw. I am a beginner in art and bought several how-to-do-it books. Of all of them Lee's books have proven the most useful. By following her methods I have produced drawings of a quality that I wouldn't have believed possible. If there were 6 stars I'd give them to her.
5,Ahhhhhh,"Ok i've been a fan of tom burris' for years, but this album tops it. It's beautifully produced and the songs are astoundingly good. They're a pleasure to listen to and have *content*. If i made music and i was really really lucky, i'd hope to make music like this......"

5,Great book for animal lovers of all ages!,"I gave this book as a gift to a 13 yr old boy who likes animals. He told me that he reads a different portion every day. Loves the way the subjects are detailed and the pictures are ""awesome."" I spent time with him looking through the book and will probably by one for myself and for future gifts. Readers can read as much or as little about any subject matter and enjoy this book tremendously."
4,Titulo de disco engan~a,"""La Reyna del Pueblo 2000"" es un disco bien hecho, pero con un titulo que engan~a al publico. Esta no es la Graciela Beltran de hoy, sino una jovencita de quizas 18 an~os. Creo que este disco fue grabado hace por lo menos 7 an~os y por alguna razon no se lanzo hasta ahora. De todos modos, es un disco vibrante y divertido. La voz de Beltran suena tan elegante como siempre y la banda que la acompan~a toca una musica muy interesante. Las mejores canciones del disco son, ""Yo Te Juro"", y ""Ya No Estas Solo"". Es un disco que les gustara a las personas que tienen afinidad para el sonido banda-bolero. Ademas, la foto que aparece en portada del disco es de lo mas lindo, de gusto para todos los que la vieron crecer de nin~a buena y convertirse en una de los grandes de la musica mexicana."
1,Beautiful..until it crashed,"it worked great, except i coudnt DOWNLOAD SONGS onto it, wich is the purpose of an MP3, isnt it?? Then it woulnt turn on."
2,"Interesting, yet never develops as it should.","Bhabha raises pertinent and fascinating points, yet I never felt as though he really elaborated on them. I was hoping to see Bhabha's opinions on parallels between the past, present and future. Both the previous reviews brought up relevent points, I felt. I wouldn't totally reject Bhabha's ideas as the first reviewer seemed to, yet the second reviewer was much too eager in his praises. In the future I think it would do Bhabha good to diversify his work."
3,Homi don't play that!,"Let's get one thing straight. Homi Bhabhi is difficult to understand. However, I think everyone else who wrote reviews is wrong. Bhabha is the only post-colonial theorist who has an adequate grasp of historical dynamics in constructing identity, while remaining unafraid to problematize notions of historicity. I don't think the other people who reviewed this book understand that. I liked this book. But I liked his earlier stuff--EG Nation and Narration--a little better."
3,I'd rather stick my hand in a blender than read this again,"The fact that this book is influential is generally beyond argument. What astonishes me, however, is that so many people had the endurance to sit through the horrific writing; the author's style is obnoxious in the extreme. The first paragraph, for example, notes that the question of culture is the ""trope of our times,"" characterized by ""a tenebrous sense of survival."" These concepts are not mind-bending. An everday, or as Homi would say, ""colloquial"" vocabularly would sufficiently articulate his thesis, yet he seems hellbent on packing his work with obscure language like he needs show off or prove something. Again, his ideas are influential, but he makes reading them as painful as possible."
3,Too many mistakes and outdated,"This book was not edited well. There are many mistakes, especially in the tone marks, which is frustrating. Also, many of the subjects are outdated (e.g., camera film and hair mousse). It does have good bits, but all around is not great."
3,Pretty,"Again, this artist puts out such beautiful videos. The costumes are beautiful, the setting is goregeous. These are things that a lot of videos don't have and I really enjoy this kind of beauty. While i enjoyed the presentation and the way this artist expresses her intention, i did not enjoy the choreography. However, this is a great video for getting the imagination going and creating your own story. This is a good DVD for begginers who would like to transiton from basic movement into dancing with a veil. All levels of dancers may be interested in the imagination this artist taps into."
4,Works great,"I installed the imaging drum a couple weeks ago and it works great. I won't know how long it will last (used one) and how it will compare to a brand new one until it is used up. But, so far I'm very satisfied. Quality is great. Thanks Steve"
2,Pre-opened box counts as new?,"When I received this product and opened a box, I noticed that the plastic bag in which the drum is packaged was opened already and several of the protective parts that Hewlett Packard mounts in the factory were removed. I went ahead and installed the drum and it seems to be working OK, but if I wasn't in such a rush to print I would have returned it. When I purchase something that is listed as new, I do not expect it to have been opened already."
5,HP Image Drum,Product arrived within one week as it was promised. Haven't used it yet as it was bought in advance of need.
5,Hp Product cheaper than from HP,HP wanted way more money and Amazon had a better price for the same products that was brand new ! why waste money?
2,Leaky and not as specified.,"I was surprised to receive this. Intex products are usually pretty reliable and inexpensive fun. First of all this tube is NOT 36"" in diameter. I must have gotten the B stock. Secondly it leaks. I bought two, hope the other one doesn't leak or I may have to amend my review. ALSO, it gets freakin HOT in the sun. No likey."
5,great party accessory,"We bought a couple of these for races at a child's car themed birthday party. It was a hit. Even when they weren't in use the way I intended them to be used, they were fun for the kids to run around with and lie on. Good times even after the party. No signs of damage either with a good amount of rough play."
5,"Excellent, but not for the Audio 8","This is a great RCA cable, great build and not as clunky as other 'premium' cables can be. Its great for use on hi-fi and home cinema equipment, but not so much for PA or DJing. Indeed, the beefy gold-plated connectors are so good that they are not compatible with RCA out / ins on mixers or Digital Vinyl System soundcards, like the Rane SL 3 or the Native Instruments Audio 8 DJ. They fit, but the sound is flimsy, I guess its because the cable needs not only good contact on the pin, but also on those fat gold-plated connectors. So if you're looking for high-quality RCAs for DJing needs, be advised they are no good on the Audio 8!"
5,great cable and it DOES sound better,"Bought this cable together with a couple others of similar quality to completely re-do the audio cabling of my main gaming and recording system. Wow, what an improvement in sound quality. I am running a splitter from the 1/8th stereo sound card jack -- on one side I amd going to a dedicated subwoofer and from there to a set of Roland computer monitors, on the other side to a rack mixer that feeds inputs into a Fostex digital multi-track. Was using cheap RS cables before. This cable replaced the piece that went from the subwoofer to the Roland monitors. Highs (cymbals, high-hats, etc.) are MUCH more noticable now and the ""punchy-ness"" of the bass (kick drum) has improved substantially as well. Just wish I hadn't suffered with bad cables for so long. RECOMMENDED if you want/like/need fidelity from your computer audio."
5,Great Quality,"As you can probably tell from all the other reviews, this is a well made product. I personally don't usually buy Belkin products but needed this cable for my DAC. Well made item, and I wouldn't hesitate buying it again."
4,Not as Much Cardio as I Hoped,"I love the moves taught on the Shakra Industrial Workout. And the amount of info is great.However, I expected more cardio and elevated heart rate since ""workout"" is part of this dvd's title. Unfortunately, much of it is instructional, meaning long gaps of slow-paced movements or explanations that allowed my heart rate to fall too much to be a proper cardio workout, even during the workout portions of the dvd.If you are looking for an instructional dance dvd (of a really neat-looking dance style with thorough explanations and a passionate dance team), this dvd is for you. This dvd is also great for strength training and teaching your muscles to move in ways you probably aren't moving in your average day-to-day.If you are looking for a good sweat routine, this is probably not for you.I enjoy the dvd for its own merits, but it wasn't what I was looking for in a workout dvd."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,EACH SAVED BY THE BELL EPISODEON THIS DVD SET ARE NOT IN ORDER.THEY ONLY PUT THE ORIGINAL AIRDATES ON SEASONS ONE AND TWO.I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'TDO IT FOR ALL THE SEASONS THEYPUT OUT SO FAR.THERE ARE ALOT OF T.V. SHOWSON DVD THAT HAVE EPISODES INORDER WITH THE ORIGINAL AIR DATES.BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD EPISODESON HERE.I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYEPISODE FROM THIS SEASON IS ON HERE.OVERALL:IT'S NOT BAD.
4,I agree,lions gate did mess up some one should e-mail them b/c the sbtb the new class was done by image and so far they are not missing a thing.
5,exactly dimmu borgir,when u listen to this record u will think only 1 thing : DIMMU BORGIR . old mans child changed alittle bit and sound just like dimmu. anyway they still sound great. this album is a must for all black metal fans .
4,this is a good recording,"this is definitley a good recording. it may sound like Dimmu Borgir, but remember who the original drummer of OMC was, none other than Tjlodav, or however you spell, who went on to play in Dimmu. Obscure Divine Manifestation is a real good track. i recommend this for fans of Emperor, and Dimmu Borgir."
3,"good posterboard, no shiny side","It's ok, but my review is colored because I was looking forward to posterboard that had one shiny side. It is decent weight, probably even a little thicker than the posterboard that I had picked up at the supermarket. I won't return one of the packages because I need it now. I might return the second package. We'll see, I don't quite like the way the printing is turning out on the non-glossy paper.Cons:*Even though it was packaged in a box within a box, it was still dented so that all of the sheets were quite bent out of shape on one corner. Luckily I was cutting them into strips so I could waste that corner.*it is white, but not bright white like the other posterboard I have*There is a sticker on every page.PROS:*The paper seems to be of a decent quality*It is of decent thickness (neither the thickest I've used, nor the thinnest, but still has a decent stiffness to it)*The sticker is easy to remove and doesn't damage the page.I hope this helps."
4,not awesome,"I read this with great interest as its core subject is of intense interest to me: where grammar rules come from, how they change, and what purpose they serve.While not bad, I would not recommend it to others like me. I read the whole thing and didn't learn much. I don't think the author has any more real insight that anybody else into these matters."
2,Interesting and boring paradox,"I have read both the Language Instinct and How the Mind Works, and I'd say this one ranks below both of those. While the book is filled with very interesting facts about verbs and language acquistion, I found it too long and tedious.. I felt like I was plowing through.For those wanting to get most of the information from this book and not ""plow"" - I'd read chapters 1-3 (The Infinite Library, Dissection by Linguistics, Broken Telephone) and then 7 (Kids Say the Darndest Things), and then 10 (A Digital Mind in an Analog World). Readers taking this approach can skim the other chapters to see if they are of interest.I found Chapter 7 to be the most interesting, as I have a young two year old acquiring language. Naturally, I'd like to have seen that section expanded. That chapter was (to me) the most revealing of the entire book."
2,"Not ""So Good"" as I expcected.","I was searching for this cd in music stores all over San Diego and when I finally got it and popped it into my cd player, I was sort of disappointed. I was excited to hear it because they worked with such talented people like Keith Martin. I'm sad to say the cd wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The vocals weren't so strong, the lyric weren't catchy...and it's a little to jazzy for my taste. They're isn't one song that I can say stands out as ""good"". In fact, I wouldn't even classify their ablum as R&B. If you are looking a really good R&B album by Pinoy/Pinay artists you should get Innerlude's ""Music Within,"" Pinay's ""Inevitable"", or One Voice's ""Just the Beginning""...those are truly good albums that you can listen to straight through without being disappointed! I'm sorry Epic Voices....you ladies sure do look good, but next time try working on the vocal a little more and change your format so that your songs will be more radio friendly and marketable."
3,experts only,This is a beautifully done book. BUT the directions are not clear at all. Unless you are very experienced in crochet I would recommend another book. All the blankets showcased here are amazing but almost impossible to duplicate with the information they give you in this book.
4,A Good Addition to My Collection,"I have completed the afghan on the front cover with an alternative main colour and it looks great. I have half finished another afghan. The only criticism of this book is that one pattern, which I love, requires that you modify a crochet hook yourself to accommodate the amount of stitches. I can't do that and was very disappointed. I would have given the book 3.5 stars if I could because of this."
2,Less Than Impressive,"While there are a few designs in here that true showstoppers I was less than impressed with the selection as a whole. Much of the offerings herein are color based, in that they aren't technically challenging at all. Others are just plain bland. The book's main appeal is the state fair information."
3,okay,"I have always enjoyed the crazy move ""the people under the stairs"", but ""Shocker"" wasn't so shocking, stunk."
3,"Not Bad, not great but not bad","I bought this to refill my Mr. Clean car wash kit also purchased here. The soap is expensive and gets used up rather quickly. I gave up on using it alone, instead I use to soap the car down and then I use a bucket of water with regular car wash in it. This one just doesn't foam up enough for me. This allows me to not use it up too fast but still gives the car a 'pre-soap' to loosen the dirt before attacking with the sponge."
2,Turned off before i opened the cover,"As a person that primarily studies loyalists, i found it greatly disturbing that the book uses the term ""British"" to describe them. All the troops but one at King's Mountain were Americans.I am immediately turned off by books that lump the Loyalists and British together and use the term American to mean ""rebel"". This causes the falacy of this not being a civil war to continue and does not put things in the correct light.Please, please, please, stop writing about them this way."
4,good set,was not sure to order cause of the reviews. But for the price its great. Some of the discs skipped but cleaned them and work fine now. So if you do get this set just clean the disc before playing them and no problems. play great on blu-ray player.
4,"Some expected scratches, but discs seem to be in good working order...so far.","About half of the discs did indeed have varying degrees of the scratching that I'd read about in other reviews, but they all test-loaded fine on my player. I've only watched a handful all the way through, but they are playing without mishap so far. As I pulled the discs from the cardboard sleeves and visually examined them, I noticed an interesting pattern: The discs in the bottom slots tended to be the scratchiest; the discs in the top slots generally were the best condition; and the middle slots held discs that usually were about midway--condition-wise-- between the other two. I don't know why that was, but it was a definite pattern.And yes, the packaging is a lovely eye-grabber. Looks nice on the shelf.Purchasing this set is probably a bit of a gamble, but I seem to have lucked out on mine."
3,WTF? MGM,The box will scratch the dvd's! A bit of quality control would be nice MGM. As for the product itself ive only watched episodes here and there and enjoyed them enough to purchase the item.
2,Poorly Packaged,"Almost the same experience as Anjela Bugher, but not quite as bad. One disc was extremely dirty and scratched all over. Many others had faint to moderate scratches only where they were inserted into the cardboard. I don't know if any of them are unplayable yet though. And I think Season 1 disc two is from the wrong set. All of the other discs say copyright 2006 on the bottom. But this one disc has a different label than the others and says copyright 2001.The show itself is great, but buyer beware on the packaging in this set."
3,Great Collection...Damaged Discs,I received my collection yesterday and immediately became worried about the factory quality of the discs. I believe it is the packaging that caused this damage so I moved them to another case. I have yet to watch through them but I have noticed 4 discs with minor scratches (I have seen worse) and one disc had damage due to the ink imprinting itself onto the disc (much like how sticky tape lifts layers of paper or ink).I am happy with the overall collection and the price but cannot overlook the insensitive damage caused due to poor package design. I contacted Amazon and have now received a 10% ($24) discount on the item.Please check your disc and contact Amazon asap if this happens to you.
4,Series collection,"Stargate SG-1 is one of my favorite series, so i was glad when i found this DVD set. It contains the entire 10 seasons, plus plenty of interesting bonus features. I did read that some people had problems with the DVD set, but luckily i have had no problems with mine. I have almost played through the entire set, and all my DVD's play fine. It's nice to have a complete set of your favorite series, and i am happy with my purchase.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
4,Protect your discs the first time!,"I love this series! What I don't love is the disc storage. In this boxed set, the discs do not pop into a case. Instead they slide into openings in a ""folder."" They get scratched easily by the sliding into and out of the case. Some of my favorite (and even not favorite) discs will no longer play easily in my computer. They will play in a projector, however. I have never used a DVD player attached to a TV for these discs. I have now put every one of the over 50 discs in plastic sandwich bags to put them back into their ""sleeves"" to prevent further damage. I would highly recommend that anyone purchasing this set protect the discs in a similar manner the FIRST time you use them.If you like Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, I suggest watching them concurrently once you get to season 8 of SG1 because there are some things that happen in both series which are funnier or more pointed if you have seen the other series.Stargate Atlantis: Complete Series Gift Set [Blu-ray]"
3,Disc formating,Formating of discs are not uniform. Some you have to go back and cursor down for the next episode for the next one some automatically go to the next one. A couple of discs have slight defects and freeze momentally.
3,Overall a great value,I have only viewed the first 6 seasons but there has only been one disk with isues. I am very happy with this purchase.
3,mixed,"I LOVE SG-1!But the packaging and the menus (no ""play all"" option on most disks) are just plain horrible. Why not just wrap it in sandpaper and require a 30-digit password to play each episode?It's a TOTAL waste of my time to have to manually select each episode to play - and the cardboard sleeve containers are total garbage."
5,first bad second GOOD,I got this as an x-mas gift from a friend!The first one was messed up bad the discs in the bottom rows were all scratched up but played better than some of the discs that were not!! remember what an amobes looks like { a blob} that is what the sides of the discs looked like in my set ! seen this before when episode 3 revenge of the sith came out { whole bunch of bad discs to begin with} was upset and returnedHad the new one at my door the same day i returned the old one {gotta love returns with amazon}the new one is in perfect condition { they started to put a micro dot of glue in the bottom to hold the discs in } there are some discs with discoloration on the data side but they still play!!! however if you buy and do get a good set i suggest a brick of jewel cases to put the discs in cause they will scratch if you keep moving them in and out of the holders!!!!!!LOVE THE SG-1 SERIES LOVE THE ATLANTIS SERIES NOT SO MUCH LOVE ON THE NEW SERIES UNIVERSE
4,"Great Series, Okay Packaging","The series was great, and the outer box design for this is amazing, but the internal packaging of the discs is by far not the best. The sleeves scratch the discs (Yes, you will get some scratched ones, I can almost guarantee it), but all of them were playable. Nothing more than small, cosmetic scratches."
1,Stargate l,"The first copy we received of this was badly damaged & we had to return it. As of this date, 1/11/11 we have NOT received an almost, watched once, copy back from the person who sent it to us. I was very disappointed in the quality & hopefully the one he does send will be a good copy. I will not order from this company again........the service has been slow (they sent it the cheapest way & I think Post Office would have been faster).Janette Todd"
1,not subtitled in english,They lie. Only subtitled in Spanish and French. Is closed caption in English but you must use an analog player instead of hmdii. SCRATCHED.
2,Box causes some disks not to play,"Some of the disks would not play because they were too scratched when they arrived. Out of the 50 disks in the set 3 were scratched to a point that they would not play, I can take them to the local DVD rental place to get the surfaces refinished but that is knida beside the point. They should arrive intact enough to play when new."
2,Scratches and dirt on discs; crashes during playback on PC,"I can confirm what others reported: Many discs are badly scratched or have dirt on them.With some white toothpaste and micro fiber tissue I was able to polishing out some scratches and made it almost to the end of disc 2, but then PowerDVD and VLC froze again.So I tried to rip the DVD using DVDDecrypter, which retries reading bad sectors, but it didn't find any on the disc. And while the original disc still crashes in all 3 DVD drives I tried, the ripped copy works just fine. Most likely some sort of copy protection, which protects me from playing it, but not from copying it.Broken discs, unplayable media due to copy protection, region code which prevents me from watching the discs on my standalone player in Europe (after I relocated from the USA), ...How can the studios seriously expect people to spend money on this, when you can get a perfectly working version free online?"
5,SG-!,"This is a great collection - of course a wonderful series helps but the box and the style of presentation of the DVDs is wonderful. It makes our collection look very nice and I am very proud of it. Buying it as a gold box special was nice also. If you like sci fi and like collections, this if for you."
4,Is Blu-ray coming??,"Love the series, but have not purchased it yet, mainly due to the quality issues reported by reviewers. I would like to know if it will be available in Blu-ray."
3,"No Subs, Bad quality DVDs, No Final","The item description tells it comes with Spanish subtitles... well, the subs are ONLY in the seasons 1, 8, 9, 10.Seasons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 have NO subs. Other problem is that some discs comes scratched from factory. They have a very bad quality control system.UPDATE: 10 seasons, 10 years in the making, but NO FINAL????????????????I can't believe it. It taken me a whole year to watch the 10 seasons to find out there is no final. A lot of chapters were just fillers, apparently the producer was out of ideas to keep writing good stories and decided to fill those empty gaps with junk chapters so he can still produce some more seasons.I can't believe it."
1,"Great show, rubbish DVD set","Firstly I'll just say I adore Stargate SG-1, it's definately one of my favourite shows ever. However, this box set is a pile of rubbish.Cheap and incredibly poor packaging not only let the set down regarding looks, but because of this cheap packaging they are scratched as well, and some of them appear to have unidentified materials - quite possibly bit of food - stuck on the bottom of them.Unfortunately for me I only recently had a disc which had a big issue (season 5) while every other disc before it was 100% fine. As it seems only the later discs in my set are of such poor quality, I cannot return this set, leaving me with an expensive, damaged, sometimes unplayable DVD set.My advice - avoid at all costs, the monetary saving just isn't worth it!"
2,Great Show! Horrible Packaging.,"Stargate SG-1 is one of the best sci-fi shows ever. Unfortunately, I can't experience it from watching these discs.The packaging is designed so the discs slide in and out of cardboard sleeves. In transit, many of the discs came out of the sleeves and were scratched badly. In addition, some of the discs that didn't appear to have come out during transit were also damaged and unplayable."
4,one disc scratched,We were very surprised to see a change in the first episode to include full frontal nudity which wasn't in the original. We have watched 8 of the 10 seasons and have not noticed any similar changes. One disc of one season was apparently scratched or improperly recorded. One or two episodes were not viewable. But for the most part they've been great.
1,POOR disc quality / Awesome TV series,"I have watched 2 seasons and already found 3 discs only suitable for coasters. I have tried a regular dvd player, and a PC DVD drive and neither can error correct enough to not skip/pause or freeze. The cardboard sleeves the discs are in are overlapped and probably the cause of the destruction of the discs. The savings are not worth it!Regardless of the faulty packaging, I am a huge fan of Stargate and Richard Dean Anderson. I would definitely recommend this tv series to any sci-fi fan."
3,you get what you pay for,I live in Australia and what caught my eye was the price being so low it cost under $100 bucks delivered which is around $10 per season so even though there were about 7-8 scratched discs due to the bad card board packaging I tested them all and they all stil played so cant complain for $100 just check all your discs arn't scratched so bad that they cant play 3 out of 5 stars
4,"Great show, Horrible packaging","I love Stargate SG-1 it's one of my favorite show's of all time. When I saw this set I was very excited it was a great price $90 for all ten seasons plus 4 bonus discs. However as pretty much everyone has said the packaging is a joke. When I got my set I took all the disc's out of the package right away. I then cleaned all the disc's(most of then had little pieces of cardboard that scratched the disc's when taking them out) and put then in protective covers. They still fit in the box but now they wont get scratched any more than they are. And yes about a third of the disc's are scratched, but so far I'm on season 1 disc 5 there's only been one skip."
2,"Looks cool, but leaks everywhere","On two separate occasions I've drenched my purse with this ""leak-proof"" sippy cup. It's not that tricky to assemble and you need to screw the cap on tight, but it still leaks. It leaks out the side and it leaks out the top by the spout. I would never purchase another one of these."
1,Excellent for drip-watering plants,"The nice steady drip makes it an excellent replacement for an Aqua Globe. Keeps my plants watered while on vacation, and I don't have to worry about washing all 5 pieces and bending my thumbnail pushing it back together any more."
3,Blue Slippy cups,"These sippy cups have a lot of parts to clean. Otherwise, I love that they are thermal so that I can put cold water or formula in them and it will stay cold for longer periods of time."
5,A HEART TUGGING MOVIE FOR ALL TO SEE,"AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE. I FIRST SAW IT WHEN IT WAS RELEASED BACK IN 1994 AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. TILL THIS DAY WHEN EVER I THINK OF THIS MOVIE AND REMEMBER SCENES FROM IT, I GET TEARY EYED. JEAN SMART PLAYED THE ROLE OF THE MOM SO CONVINCINGLY THAT I REALLY FELT FOR HER. I HOPE THIS FILM IS RERELEASED ON DVD SOMETIME SOON BECAUSE I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO BY ONE. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A COPY TO BUY EVER SINCE I SAW IT ON ABC THEATER FOR TV."
3,Michael Martin Murphy Wildfire 1972-1984,"Murphy had a few great songs, most of which are on this album. Used product was in excellent condition. Product was as advertised."
1,I thought this book was one of the worse I've ever read,"I only completed this book because I have never started a book and not finished it. If I were to break my rule, this would have been the book that done it. My fiance' purchased this book for me from the author at a book signing. I had no idea the book was going to be so poorly written. I don't think Ms. Breaux is of the same league as Toni Morrison or Gloria Naylor at all. I thought the plot concept was poorly conceived and developed. I was surprised to find that other readers gave this book such high reviews."
4,Intense Beauty,"I first saw them opening for Mr. Bungle in '95, and I was pretty much blasted into the back row. These guys can really shake a club up. It's no wonder they're the most popular of the new wave of Japanese avant-punk bands right now. Extremely hyper, noisy, but generally tight. The best part of this band, IMO, is not the kinetic sounds they produce, but the insanely poetic lyrics. Sure, you can't understand them most of the time, but try reading them on the CD jacket. Kind of Beat, kind of surreal, ultimately charming. Impressive, passionate band, and I bet they only get better."
2,it gets old,"When I first heard Melt Banana I was in love. Unfortunately I like them less and less the more I listen to this album. It has a lot less raw power than ""Scratch or Stitch."" I noticed that a lot of the sounds on the album couldn't be duplicated live although their pure-noise-craving fans didn't seem to mind. It seems like they had a lot of help on this album, being buddies with John Zorn, Mike Patton, and others willing to enhance Melt Banana's energy. Personally, I thought ""Charlie"" was great at first, but it really wears thin."
1,worst band ever,A bunch of no talent bums people like this should be put to sleepreminds me of charles bronson albums but they had some talentdont even bother with this bandthey dont even deserve a 1
1,Below one star,"This band is terrible, one of my friends recomended them to me because i like Mr. Bungle, but i cant stand this band. Every member in the band sounds like they are playing their own song all at once. Its just a bunch of noise. And how can anyone say that they like the lyrics, there arnt any, just a bunch of screeching into the mic. and just because i cant understand them doesnt mean that i love mtv popculture, in fact i cant stand it. I dont know how anyone can actually think that this band has talent."
4,Good Product Limited Use,"This is good little TV. I purchased for the bathroom. Living in Atlanta we have a sudden increase of dgtv providers. It does exactly what I want! Never liked reading the news paper while in that room, HEHE! I do not recommend this unit for travel but just as an alternative option in a major metro area! I have mine hooked up to cable...YES I have cable in my bathroom!! Otherwise, it full fills what I wanted."
1,Does Not Recharge,We got this at work to preview while recording video. Unfortunately the batteries won't recharge.
3,A disappointing overview.,"I have to admit, I do NOT want rerecorded versions of the old songs. I do NOT want them passed off as the great old versions. Therefore, this disc greatly disappointed me. The versions of the songs off Wild Child are especially bland."
3,Wrong Title to Begin With,"I looked for this disk as a gift for someone. I had the band name correct, but I noticed that Amazon.com and some other music stores call the disc, Ghetto Soul, when the name is Ghetto Stout."
3,Definitely a find - not the best yet.,"Went into a music store today, which had a free sample of ""Everything I need"", which I listened to carefully for maybe half an hour. Sure - perhaps not enough time to make a real judgement, but enough to note a few things...I found that a couple of songs on the CD sounded a lot like something from an Alanis Morisette cassette (pardon the bad pun). Also, I found the way that each song started with maybe 10 to 30 seconds of music before the actual singing became a bit boring and repetitive. On the plus side, I'll be the first to admit that Melissa has a great voice and definite talent - keep trying, Mel, I might even like one of your albums someday..."
1,Anonymous players indicates substandard performances.,"Why can't the label provide the names of the performers? Is it because they're total unknowns? Is it because this is a compilation of poorly recorded tracks from the 60s? One has to wonder. As much as I'd like to buy this, I fear it'll be some Madacy-style disappointment.2011: Incredible to me that only 4 out of 10 people found my review helpful. Does that mean the other 6 people thought this was a GOOD album? That's truly scary!"
3,The original is better,"The music is beautiful, and this is the definitive Christmas opera, but the original recording is much better. This is an almost too polished version. Every sylable is just so, and each part is so perfect it is almost boring. The child in the original is much better because he is not so polished that it seems affected."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I bought this video for two reasons: 1) I wanted to see beautiful women in little or no clothing, and 2) I miss seeing the original NITRO Girls on TV every Monday night. If I had watched the video with the sound turned down, I might've given it 5 stars instead of 3. Chae showed lots of skin, Kimberly is just flat-out gorgeous, and there's something about Spice that's always made her my favorite NITRO Girl. What ruined it for me somewhat was the horrendous dialogue. In between the video from photo shoots, the women engage in embarrassingly scripted chatter that forced me to start fastforwarding through it. I would have much rather seen unscripted interviews of the girls where they talk about their personal lives and their experiences in WCW. After seeing how poorly they handled the talking parts, I can understand why they all either quit or were fired from WCW when they were asked to do more than just dance."
4,Good T & A Video,"This is a video that has a lot of T & A, it explains a bit about the Nitro Girls but mostly shows the girls doing what they do best, there is one part where on of the girls takes the camera guys into the shower and shows some good cleavage, this movie will show you the great bodies, and will make any man ""rise to the occasion"" !!"
2,Inferior Tank level Indicator - Leaks,I have had two (2) of these exact automatic changeover regulators installed on my two 100Lb Propane cylinders over the last eight years and the indicator always develops a leak. If that could be corrected in the manufacturing process I would buy it. Can anyone tell me where I can purchase the same type of regulator from another manufacturer?
3,How Clovis points were made,"This DVD is an archaeological peice, not a ""how to"". If you want to learn flintknapping DC Waldorf's ""The Art of Flintknapping"" is a better place to start. In Clovis Technology Bruce Bradley introduces new archaeoligical evidence that the Clovis point was made using a technique known as overshot flaking. Bradley is a skilled flintknapper and this technique must be hard because he fails at it. After removing only a few overshot flakes he resorts to conventional knapping and never gets back to overshot flaking. He blaims this on a new billet that he had never used before. Not sure why the project wasn't scrapped and filmed another day when things were going right. It would have been more educational to see the point made completely with overshot technology."
5,"An excellent, highly readable and important book.","Enormous Prayers is an excellent, highly readable, and important book. It should be required reading for everyone - Catholic or not - along with the daily paper."
3,Classified Rules,All of Classifieds work is awsome hope you enjoy it too.let me say this thou its not as great as his new stuff but still its good it lets you see how he improved and were he started from.Enjoy
5,A Must Have For Any Classified Fan!,"While Trial & Error and Boy-Cott-In The Industry are getting a lot of attention, all true classified fans need to have Union Dues. This CD is completely self-recorded and produced and has some of Classified's greatest songs... Politics, Questions, Things Keep Changing... BUY THIS CD!Sarah D."
2,Too Quiet,"The only problem is that it's just way too quiet, I can turn my volume all the way up and still can't hear anything walking through the city"
3,Maxell stereo Ear Clip headphones,"item shipped quickly & arrived in great condition. The product itself, while it what I was lookikng for, the sound quality is not the best."
1,Broken out of the package,"I do not like earbuds so I always look for clip on headphones. These were the only choice available in my small home town. I used the first pair twice and now only the left earphone works. I bought a second pair tonight, took them straight out of the package to use and the right earphone was already broken. I'm not even sure how the other reviewer got theirs to last six weeks with both ear pieces working. Mine broke instantly! They will be returned tomorrow."
4,Dorman Intake,Great aftermarket replacement. Only problem was the holes to hold down accelerator cable bracket could have been tapped or had inserts.
3,installed fine,"Works, what can I say? Arrived in a timely fashion. i would recommend this item to anyone rebuilding an engine."
4,"Great Intake Manifold, Alternator bracket needs work","The intake manifold itself fit perfectly.The screws that tap into the plastic broke off easily, I was clearly applying a little too much force but they could also just as easily been a little bigger.My biggest complaint about this manifold is that it does not allow the use of the original alternator mount bracket. The new bracket that comes with the manifold mounts the spark plug wires further back from where Ford originally had them. I was unpleased with this and modified the original Ford alternator bracket to work by drilling some holes accurately in the correct place.Does not stop it from working but it would not have been hard to have the plug wire mounts in the correct location."
3,Should be all metal.,"Another upgraded part to replace a Ford garbage part. Not my car fortunately, but I would have preferred if the part was all metal. The part was recalled a few years ago by Ford. Hopefully this part will last for my friend. It does have the convenience of preinstalled gaskets and an included thermostat and seal. It would also be helpful if injector o-rings (upper and lower) were included in the kit. I had to go to three local stores to get all sixteen. Everything went in easy and torqued just fine. No fuel or coolant leaks detected after test drive (operating temperature). Will see how well it does down the road."
4,REALLY GOOD,LOVE IT AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD ALSO. MY HUSBAND LOVES IT AND HE HAS HIS OWN CONTRACTING BUSINESS AND IT GETS USED ALOT. WILL BE BUYING MORE FROM YOU.
2,Mmmm -- They made one big mistake.,"To tell the truth, Vanished accually looked like a great show. I watched it since the very beginning and even though a lot happened that made me think 'Wow-How can they solved such a thing' I was still intrigued. But the biggest mistake was that they never should killed Kelton (Gale Harold) off of the show. He was wonderful and I couldn't believe that they'd kill the main character. And I am still mad at them. So for Gale Harold I'd give 6/5 stars, but for the show I'd give like 1 star."
5,Useful and helpful,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers were talking about (esp. since this book has maps AND pictures), but I found this guidebook to be indispensable when I was planning my hiking trips in Utah. I found the ratings system simple and informative, especially since there's a short explanation of the system in the book's beginning. It's a first-rate guide and I recommend it highly."
5,A product that works!,"The hygrometer readings were correct within 1% relative humidity right out of the box. No need to calibrate or adjust (there is no way to adjust this instrument anyway). I placed it next to a calibrated electronic display, and they were within 1% of each other. One suggestion is to lightly tap the cover glass before making a reading. This allows the temperature and humidity needles to slightly jiggle to their correct readings."
4,Legendary soul man returns,"Hermon Hitson's ballards have a style that is Gospel-influenced, gritty and real, essential 60s soul, before it was over-sweetened and diluted until it lost its heart. Many songs here were written by Hermon as well. Check out in particular: A Dream I Had as well as title song. There is much to like about this CD - original music sung by one of the true masters of the soul music world."
4,nice mat for sunbathing,"I order two of these mats because it is fun to get sun in the pool. We do not have children so I do not know how durable they would be. However, I think the quality will be fine for us and they will last for the season."
1,"Good show, but cheaper individually","Harvey Birdman is filled with comic delight and was indeed the best show [adult swim] has ever offered up. That said, DO NOT get this 3-pack. I purchased the complete series of Sealab 2021 this way because it was cheaper and all four seasons came together in a plastic wrapper. This is not the case with Harvey Birdman Volume 1-3. Most [adult swim] DVDs on Amazon are about $20. But this 3-pack averages each volume at $27!!! Great idea, Amazon, but cut back on the price. I don't think you'd lose money by making this set $50-$60."
2,old model watch. didn't come with plastic cover.,I'm not sure this watch is worth $ 125. This watch is a old model. You couldnt find in any retail stores.
4,RG's review is spot on,One thing I didn't realize was that this is either a numeric keypad for your windows PC or a calculator. Meaning you can't use the calculator to compute when connected to the PC.Worked great on my Vista laptop. I might get another one for travel.The only con I saw was that the battery is not supposed to be user replaceable although it has solar power.
2,strap comes out -- iPhone/android fits?,"Several, several reviewers have said the strap is not sewn in well. This is discouraging in what otherwise looks like a nice bag. The question, though, is: is the cell phone pocket big enough for an iPhone or android phone?"
4,Kooistra - start writting!,"Science Fiction isn't necessarily rocket science. Maybe since I am such a prolific reader my standards are a little lower, but I really enjoyed this book. It was fast paced and easy to read. The author's style is somewhere between Robert Heinlein and Rick Shelley. You cared about the characters and the aliens were believable and not just your usual humans with skull ridges or antennas.The last gauge of whether I really enjoyed a book: I came looking for other books by the same author. Since its his first book, I guess I have to wait."
1,Shallow and dull,"What do you do when you have a problem? You ask Dykstra, the old, kindly, unimaginatively brilliant genius to solve it for you. And solve it he does, usually with little or no effort on his part.Thus runs this book. Step one, there's a problem. Step two, Dykstra considers the problem. Step three, Dykstra solves the problem. The characters are shallow and the plot fairly uninteresting. I don't recommend this book."
4,"This isn't fine literature, but it's decent space opera","I read this few years ago and liked it. I was disappointed when Mr. Kooistra didn't write any more books, but such is the nature of the publishing industry or the author's whimsy. Some of the critics difficulties stem from their not agreeing with the incredible mind powes of Dykstra. The counter to their argument is that this is a novel and thereby normal rules of reality can be bent or ignored and super genisues may be created. Another criticsm stems from the Christian element to the book. Since most sci-fi tends to display Christians as people who are well intentioned morons or backwards yokels who need to be taught the basic rudiments of modern society like electric lighting, forks, and houses that aren't shacks, this book is sort of a counterbalance--and a welcome one at that. Despite its faults, which to me were ignorable and this novel comes out a winner."
2,Quality versus low value,"I do not know where the roots of the problem are, but I was very much disappointed by the Smithsonian Birds of North America edition. It was a really difficult task to identify a bird species. As I have also bought The Complete Guide to the Birds of Europe by Killian Mullarney, Lars Svensson, Dan Zetterstroem and Peter J. Grant - this book is a true example and a Pro Guide to Smithsonians how to do their low paid??? job more responsibly and professionally, as it is unlikely that European authors earn more. ...smells Wal-Mart, like the whole country does. The quality of the print, or rather color reproduction was also annoying."
3,"A good resource, BUT...","...take it with a grain of salt. This is an excellent overview of period fashions, but unfortunately it's become the reenactor's bible. Ms. Leisch is not a historian and I find it difficult to believe that one person found the absolute truth from such a relatively small sampling of photos. Yes, Godey's Lady's Book was the ""Vogue"" of today, but since the dawn of tim less-affluent women have copied the fashions of the well-to-do in more affordable fabrics. I've seen reenactors chastised or expelled from events ""because you're too old for this outfit"" etc using ONLY this book as the basis. (I have a daguerreotype of my great-great-grandmother, age 35, middle class, in a Zouave jacket, with her hair parted on the side, by the way)"
1,"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat - a real rank amateur","This overpriced underproduced documentary suffers from muffled sound quality, an annoying musical sound background to any and all of its narration, terrible video quality of scenes familiar to anyone who has seen any WWII documentary footage. Misspellings (""Airborn"" for ""Airborne"") are rife, and the entire four-disc set is a waste of sixty dollars. The product description, bareboned, ought to have been a tip-off. Save your money and put it toward better more professionally produced documentary series."
1,Interesting Book,I feel much more informed after reading this book. I now have a greater understanding of why the world is in such a mess. May God have mercy on us.
4,Mr,"Very interesting read.should be required reading in all schools I am a big history fan and have done quite a bit of study into American history, yet most of this book is New to me."
1,Come on WB!,"Not buying, won't buy! Still waiting for Golden Collection 7!!!Listen up WB!WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR MORE GOLDEN COLLECTIONS!PREFERABLY WITH EPISODES AFTER 1939!"
5,perfect weight,"This performance fleece hoodie is the perfect mid-weight warmer against the cool or as a layer under a jacket. Has zippered pockets, elastic around the hood and cuffs, and adjustable elastic draw around the bottom. Nice looking too!"
1,The best? Pu-LEAEEEEEEEEEESE!,"Well, maybe I just don't ""get"" these 3 games, but, I gotta tell ya'.....THEY ALL SUCK!Horrible graphics, and three of the WORST GAMES EVER....But, hey! You get THREE of them! So, great value! (sarcasm)I wouldn't buy this is my life depended on it. Unfortunately, I ""did"" but it, and I GAVE IT AWAY the very next day!"
3,PS3 version is gimped,"Important note: This game causes motion sickness if you aren't a seasoned FPS player. The parts where you use the airboat and the jeep are going to make you want to vomit.Now that I've played both versions, I'm going to say the PS3 is gimped and broken. The Half Life epidsoes suffer framerate issues and glitches compared to the 360 version. The load times aren't much better, either.As for Team Fortress 2, I don't see enough people playing and it's always the same few maps. The fun aspect isn't there, either, compared to other multiplayer games. The Half Life episodes are good solitary fun, it's a lot of single-player story crammed into one disc. Portal is a unique game, great evil computer commentary, and truly unique gameplay."
1,I already miss Incandescent bulbs,Expensive for a light bulb but figured if it provided a couple of years of use not such a bad deal. Burned out after a couple of months. Amazon tried to send a replacement twice. Both times the bulb arrived rattling and broken. Lousy bulb that keeps breaking in shipment. Don't buy unless you want to see how effortless the amazon return system is.
2,CHEVERE...,"Thats about all i can say about this... this man DOES NOT SING SALSA at least not danceable salsa. He does some pop/bolero mescla that i personally cannot stand and MARC ANTHONY IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT TYPE OF SALSA.I give this CD 2 stars b/c most of the songs are so played out that its cool to listen but if you want real salsa Victor Manuelle is not the artist you are looking for.Ray Barreto,Ismael Miranda,Gran Combo and if i dont stop naming them this review would be very,very long..."
4,the long and winding road: dementia & your parent,If you are dealing with a loved one with dementia this is a powerful book. Recommended to me by someone who started down the road with their mother before I did. Caring for a loved one with dementia is a huge challenge. This book helps you try to find grace in the challenge. On my best days I know the lady who lives here is no longer my mother and this book helped make that be OK!
5,Incredible System for the Price,"I did lots of research before buying this system 4 years ago. It was pretty widely agreed on in forums that this was the cheapest all in one portable PA system you could buy that still had professional sound quality. And I totally agree, this thing sounds AMAZING for the price, and it gets LOUD. Don't let the size fool you. This thing will pump out some serious volume. These things have taken a beating too. They've been on 8 or 9 outdoor camping trips/festivals and been left outside in rain, stepped on, slept on (haha), and all kinds of abused, and they still work and sound perfectly (they even survived being used on top of a van for about 4 hours while the van drove around rocky roads). I couldn't recommend these things more. This is the only PA system I've ever bought, and if these speakers died today, I'd probably go buy them again tomorrow."
4,Very Good Wireless Headphone,This is a replacement for the headphones I got a number of years ago when I bought the complete wireless set. This is as good as the original and provides a very good sound quality. I have never had a problem with the battery life even though I use the headphones at least six hours a day.
1,Product is not what it used to be,"I used to love these but P& G has replaced the pads with an inferior product. The pads leave heavy very dull streaks on my floor. I contacted customer service who I informed of the problem and to check the complaints on the internet. While she was nice she said she had no time for this since customer service was currently overwhelmed by complaints (ya think?). She said i could mail back the unused boxes and get my money back, like i have time for this nonsense. Also this has a Goodhouse Keeping seal of approval, that's a joke. I am back to an old-fashioned mop. Also a closer examination of the box says it isn't safe for my pet !!! My advice is save your money."
1,Don't buy a Maverick Ice Cream Maker,If you need to replace a part you will have no place to do so. I bought a Maverick a couple of years ago from HSN. The lid split after I'd had it a few months but I was outside of HSNs coverage period for a replacement. I tried to contact Maverick for a replacement but never heard back from them. Presently I have the lid taped but it is getting so bad I won't be able to use it much longer. I contacted HSN for a contact number for Maverick and they have none.
5,wonderful product,"I love this product! No more bending over the litterbox with a slotted spoon. Just lift up the corners of the top sheet of the liners and let the litter flow out the holes, leaving all the clumps behind. If you have a ""digger"" he may tear it and you will have to use the next sheet as well. The last two sheet do not have holes, so dirty litter need not ever touch the box itself. No more scrubbing the box in the bathtub. A similar product was being sold at a major pet store chain but they stopped for some stupid reason. Thank heavens I found them here."
3,Sifting cat liners,"These liners are functional, but a little flimsy. I wish the liners were a little heavier."
3,Davey Crockett in Space (without much Space)!,"As many others probably have been, I was roped into this one by the pretty cover, which has nothing to do with the actual story line. Our poor misinformed Terran heroes, facing the mighty Dilbians (too big to be Hokans, and, really, to be funny) on their own planetary turf, still emerge victorious in several incredible (and slightly implausable) ""Rescue the Fair-Maiden"" scenarios. But, as an evidently retreaded pulp collection, it's still a decent read for a bad weather afternoon, or, even better, as a late night ""read yourself to sleep""."
5,Magnifica novela,"La prosa de Benedetti cautiva al lector. Leer esta novela me produjo un sinfin de sensaciones; desde sus arremetidas contra los puertorriqueños y las puertorriqueñas ( que lei con pena ) hasta la forma en que sus personajes adquieren una profundidad psicologica poco vista en la literatura ( cosa que desperto en mi una gran admiracion hacia el autor ), toda la novela posee una carga emocional, intelectual y, existencial que le da grandeza. Para mi humilde entender, esta novela es superior a ""La Tregua""."
1,Buy something else....,"My fiance got this MP3 player for Christmas. The buttons are not in a user-friendly layout and it's not easy to find the button you need. There is no carrying case or strap to make it easy to carry around...it [isnt good] if you want to use it to work out. Downloading music to it is not easy at all, especially for computer novices...and the worst thing, is that one day, it just stopped working completely...and we can't figure out how to fix it. I would recommend the [something else]..."
1,"Worthwhile, except for --","the extra tracks mania intended to resell that we already have fifteen times over.How about not screwing it up: simply remaster the original LPs, including all those released after he was killed, leave off the extra tracks nonsense, then release them in the form originally intended.No more raving about Holly in effort to sell yet again that which all Holly fans already have at least once."
4,complicated but entertaining,"MUCH better than the first. Sure it was kind of long-winded and depressing, and it was hard to understand since Greeno keeps you almost completely in the dark for most of the book, but all in all, not bad"
5,"Romanticized view of a brutal, decadent regime","The author has clearly chosen sides and presents a biased and opinionated account. In my opinion, the Mughals were brutal, xenophobic and decadent -- and they were not missed. Nevertheless, an excellent book - if you can ignore his bias."
4,FC-8M,"PLS. SEND INFORMATION ON CANON POWERSHOT S200, COMPACTFLASH CARD FC-8M. THE FC-8M CONTAINS 12 TO 14 PICTURES. I NEED A BIGGER SIZECARD. WHUCH ONE IS BETTER, AND FOR WHAT PRICE. SHIP TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL.THANK YOU.Israel Shur."
3,Murder Along the Cape Fear,"Though the excerpts of this book sounded really good, I just couldn't get into it because the book was too much about the author and not enough of the story line itself. Half way through the book I gave it away to someone else who might have better luck getting into it."
3,Great Stories - Poor and Inconsistent Translations,"I read these in French a long time ago. The collected volume is decent but the two second novellas are not well translated as they don't convey Kristof's original narrative tone very well. The first story, ""The Notebook"" does a better job in this regard but still lacks the proverbial ""punch"" of the original French version. Reader beware - the three novellas are translated by different writers - something I found quite odd in this context."
5,Excellent,"This book is full with interesting information with colorful pictures. You're not only learning about veterinary medicine but also about ethics, laws and management practice within the veterinary practice."
2,Missing episode 7 and 9.. WHY?,"Unbox is missing episodes 7 and 9 for no particular reason. Are you kidding me? I also downloaded the latest episode of Heroes.. only to find it downloaded some episode of ""Life"" - I was charged for an episode I did not want. I still have not received the right episode of Heroes. I want my money back."
1,why oh why?,"The first Phenomena album was a different and very interesting project. The follow up (""Dream runner"") was alright, but the third time around (""Inner vision"") things hit rock bottom. It's hard to believe that there's anything in common with the first release, and ""Inner vision"" lacks everything from inspiration to writing skills. This was also the end for the project, a very good decision! Remember that I have warned you about this one!Just out of curiousity - how can an unknown singer be under rated?"
3,Surprisingly disappointing...,"Although everyone was waiting for this recording by Ms. Argerich, it turned out to be surprisingly disappointing, at least, for me. She is not as fierce as usual. She seems to choose following his former husbands' conducting, not fighting. Of course, there is no problem in her techniques. But this is not what I wanted to hear from Ms. Argerich..."
2,Medal of letdown,"Not exactly a fair fight. The multiplayer is garbage. If your allies, you parachute into the action. Sounds cool right? Not when enemies snipers just keep picking you off before you hit the ground. Lets talk hit detection. Pretty much, no matter where you shoot a Nazi...he will simply shrug it off and run away. The difficulty is really off on this one. Sure, you can take some hits, but the enemies can take half a clip of .30 caliber ammunition and still charge at you too! Also, let's say you die, you are started in a spot where it may take minutes (1-2) or (5-7) for your ""squad"" to show up and help you. So basically, for some unknown amount of time, you must fight the entire German army by yourself. Phew, my ""squad"" is finally here. I hope they can help me out now. Aaaaawe they are all dead from a single grenade. Your ""squad"" AI makes them act like a bunch of drunken raccoons, rather than a crack airborne unit."
2,Too hard to finish missions,"Missions are too difficult and long, have to go back and get health kits, most missions require a sniper rifle and other weapons under perform. The snipering works quite well, it can be a snipering type of game."
2,Cheap knockoff,I dont know what everyone else is talking about.. I think this game was very poorly made. The graphics arent that great at all. (probably worse then call of duty 2). The controls are sketchy and unconfortable. Overall EA was just copying call of duty 2 but did a bad job. Buy call of duty 2 its like 20 bucks.
2,BLAND & PRETENTIOUS,"What does contemporary American poetry have in common with pot-bellied pigs? Nothing! This is precisely what we find in this book of poems by Lisa Glatt. There is no tradition in her ""voice"" and nothing we haven't heard before. There is so much one can take when she is baraged with poems about sleeping with every freak in her neighborhood. What next? The elevator boy? The homeless ex-clown? The zoo keeper? This book indulges in depravity and is not fit for human ears. Not recommended at all!"
2,Romance or Porn?,"I'm sorry, but this book was a little too much for this ole gal. I enjoy a good romance as well as the next one, but this was a little over the top for me. There were more sex scenes than there was plot. And some of those sex scenes were so explicit that I felt like I was intruding where I shouldn't be. If books were rated as movies were, I would definitely rate this one a X. I don't think they could even show the things written here in a R rated movie."
4,Keeps them Warm and Happy,"I have had this product for over 4 years now and used for 3 of our children.Great for cold weather, so so for wet weather (not water proof but resistant and hole in top)We used it in high 30sF to low 40sF with our little ones cozy and warm, (blankets obviously recommended)Pleanty of distance from children's face that was concern with ""retail"" versions.Would be nice to have some different colors but a great ""must have"" item."
5,It's not Phish,"If you're expecting Phish, don't buy this album. Much like Seis de Mayo, this is an album that features Trey's ability for music composition and arrangement. Any true phan will tell you most of Trey's post-breakup releases have been sub par. But this one is actually worthy of a 5 star rating. If you liked Seis de Mayo, you will probably like this album. If you're expecting Phish, you won't like this. If you're expecting Trey's signature guitar solos, don't buy this album. If you're expecting a jam session with former Phish members who happened to show up at the studio, don't buy this album."
3,Different for Trey,"I am a big Trey Anastasio fan. I sense with this CD he is expanding his musical taste. This reminds me of Elvis Costello and how he branches in many directions, musically.This CD is good. I actually give it 3 1/2 stars. I am a fan of Jazz and funk, however, this CD seems to be a little ""TOO BUSY"" for my taste. I think Trey is brilliant, however, I also think this really is not his Genre.I am not dissapointed with my purchase, it's just something I will not indulge in as per say BAR 17 or SHINE."
2,The Human Factor,"It was brought to my attention that it was somewhat my obligation to read this book for personal reasons. Having done so, it simply confirmed that I would rather be stranded on an island for a month with a veterinarian surgeon than a prime minister. I am not interested in the subjects of banking, wealth, power, and corruption so I found the book fantastically boring. However, for individuals who are intrigued by such topics, I have no doubt that Mr. Cohan has produced an entertaining read on the above and done his homework industriously. On a note of irony, I joined Lazard as a secretary or ""coffee-pourer"" starting in 1980, for the next seventeen years, and it was there that I worked for a solid and worthy individual. This man of substance was one of my finest teachers of what is essential to lead a life well-considered, which to quote a famous author, is nothing but this, that each should act in conformity with their nature and their business."
2,Why Was This Book Needed?,"Lazard Freres and Co.'s strategy was to offer clients the wisdom of its collection of the finest and most experienced investment bankers, risking no capital of its own. It began as a dry goods store in New Orleans in 1848, moving to San Francisco the next year after a city-wide fire. There it switched to banking in 1876. In 2005 it held an IPO and became publicly held.""The Last Tycoons"" also contains particular emphases on the biography of Felix Rohatyn, ""preeminent among Lazard's great men,"" and the corporate infighting that occurred while Cohan was a broker there.Unfortunately, we don't learn what Lazard's people did to earn the firm's enormous fees. So, why do we need 752 pages on this topic?"
2,Boastful book with a few barbs for those who crossed him!,"Somewhat dull look at a very smart but very vain, and boastful man. He names some of his enemies and others he outsmarted in his business ventures, which seems a bit mean spirited to say the least! Good reading for an insomniac like me. It put me right to sleep!"
4,Love him or hate him--You have to respect him.,"""The Art of the Comeback"" is an inspirational account of a brilliant man looking adversity in the face and then making it work to his advantage. ""The Art of the Comeback"" allows the reader to get to know ""The Donald"" on his own terms and in his own words. Trump discusses the rewards of hard work, the loyalty of others, the women in (and out of) his life, and his ability to rise to the top again after being billions of dollars in debt.Some may mistake Trump's confidence for arrogance. That's not arrogance, that's honesty. It is ok to claim to be one of the best when you *are* one of the best. Trump has gone from having it all, to losing it all, to amassing it all again plus some. Trump is a phoenix that will undoubtedly always rise from the ashes."
4,round 2,"I love the guy, once again, you must give it up for trump, the man knows what he is doing. He, in this book, has managed to highlight his victories ....how he came back to financial prosperity. But wait,how did he go down in the first place. He purposly mangages to ignore the finer points (the negatives)...and again, makes himself to be nothing less of a godly figure. Sure probably 50 percent of the book is fabricated. But its fun reading no doubt. You have too respect a guy who doesnt give up and knows what it takes to reach the top....."
3,Gopher book could be more,"This book directed squarely at end-users of Gopher technology, not anyone hosting a Gopher-site.It's heavy on the application side, and light on the protocols and nuts-n-bolts of exactly how the protocol works. I was hoping for something more technical along the lines of books published by O'Reilly Publishers.If you're looking for a book on how to set up your gopher site and what exactly the .link settings should be, this book won't help you. There's no information on how to setup a Gopher server, despite the chapter listing.If you're looking for a book with handy tips about using WSGopher, some (outdated?) Gopher links, and some good overview information from a user end, then this book is good.People searching for this book probably already have experience using Gopher. This book needs to be seriously revised and updated, and possibly a second book aimed more at technical users and Gopher-site developers."
5,Bohola CD,"The CD arrived as promised and was in excellent condition. The Bohola tracks again showed the mastery that the group has for solid lyrics, and traditional sounds, great job."
2,Batteries put off a oder when used,"Like I said in the title, they stink when used and don't last near as long as the original batteries did. I am sorry to say this, but after 27 years of running the shop with 1 employee I think we can tell you difference between good and bad. Thankyou"
3,"keyboare's greaat, mouse needs trapping","The keyboard's great, and its battery lasts nearly forever.The mouse is big and uncomfortable in my hand [a normal-sized woman's hand, not small, not large] and uses AA batteries at a fearful rate. It's so annoying in every respect that I'm buying another mouse."
2,Made in China,"Have had this for about 6 months and am starting to have problems. I type quickly and it has always had trouble keeping up. Lately, it skips or duplicates letters/spaces or locks up completely. I type a lot in my job and it's frustrating when I have to wait and then go back and correct what it screwed up. I've been pushing the ""connect"" button on the bottom when this happens and it helps for a while and then starts over again a few minutes later. I'm going back to my old-fashioned wired keyboard for a while to save my sanity."
1,Junk,"If I could've given this a half a star, I would've. The only reason for the half star would be that the mouse hasn't quit on me yet. I bought this on a Friday and the keyboard quit working on me on Sunday. I changed batteries and tried resetting, and NOTHING. I finally managed to call Logitech, and after almost 2 hours on the phone with them, the best advice they could ofer was to take it back and exchange it for another one.. YEAH RIGHT !!!! Like I would buy this piece of junk again. Although the mouse is still working, it is and has been very touchy. It's too sensitive, and there's nothing I can do about it. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.. Well, maybe I would.."
2,major interface change,"Caution: MX2004 is out. Personally I prefer flash 5. It was intuitive and you didn't need two monitors to use it effectively, but I guess Macromedia have to make a buck somehow and are following the Microsoft/Norton software release model. (MX2004 PRO, MX 2004). The only thing the MX2004 software release in 2003 confirms is that MX wasn't that mature."
5,Unique and superb in every way,"I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is a wonderful introduction to the Civil War -- and so much more.Numerous removable inserts are included along the way: replicas of telegrams, letters, orders, maps, newspaper articles, Gettysburg Address, surrender document, etc. There is also a 70-minute audio CD, well-narrated and including actors reading some of the participants' own words. There is an excellent mix of familiar photos and many unfamiliar ones. This coffee-table size book comes in an attractive and sturdy slip case.Congratulations to Mr. Wertz for providing such a terrific book. I own several dozen books on the Civil War, but if I could only own five, this would be one of them. This belongs in every library and school.Rated and reviewed by Frank Meredith"
2,Sigh...,"The book that turned me away from this strange series. All the other books I'd read bothered me in some way, but this book was just ridiculous! ANYONE who would even TRY to make voo-doo stuff sound real is weird, and needs to get a grip on reality. But the Cheetah Girls seem like the type of girls that would believe that junk, anyway. Overall, I would say that this would have been a cool and popular series if it had been writtin by a different author. I mean, the girls practically dislike each other, and if they were real people I knew, I'd say they were just using each other to live their own dreams."
1,It is *NOT* platform independent!!,".Although SMC deceptively states that this product is ""platform independent"" you will not find any Macintosh software to configure the print server.BOTTOM LINE ... Unless you play on a PC the integrated print server will be useless - a real waste of your hard earned money."
2,Pros and Cons of Backpacking,"The author is a very successful businessman and he makes this very apparent from the start. He does a decent narrative of the trail experience, but it is often lost in his ego related side trips. While he never really claimed to be a through hiker, he often berated the hikers he encounters. For instance he cannot seem to get his head around the idea of one hiker who chose to camp outside of one the trail towns instead of pushing on into town for the night. On other occasions he leaves the trail and picks it up down the line a ways (similar to the way Bryson did it). On one occasion he is picked up by corporate jet at a remote runway to make his way to a business meeting. All in all, not a bad read if you can make room for the authors ego in your backpack."
2,What???!!,"This adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's book is, in a word, HORRIBLE! While I've read Cooper's ""The Last of the Mohicans"", I've never read this particular story, and this movie did not encourage me to read it. The dialogue was juvenile; the acting was atrocious (what made these normally good actors take on this project is bewildering). I'm only giving two stars because I felt sorry for the actors to have to endure this project, otherwise it would've been one (or minus one)."
4,From the memoirs of Lora: A Time Gone By,Good wholesome book. The period setting between the Civil War and 1950's was a great time period. Not enough books out there set during that time. Different because it briefly touched on subjects like interracial forbidden love during the 1800's. Reminded me a lot of the love affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings.Read it in two days.
4,A VOICE OF REASON,FINALLY SOMEONE HAS ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF SO CALLED MENTAL DISORDERS WITH DIET. THIS BOOK COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE OR THE LIFE OF SOMEONE YOU KNOW. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE. ALICE W.
5,an easy guide to staying healthy,I read this book in one day. It can be used as an encyclopedia of nutrition as well as a one read. This and other books from Gary Null have changed my life forever. Thanks again.Michael
3,Good for beginners,"This book is fair when it comes to details, but appears overly short in the meaning and linking Bible prophecy for the many locations covered. One thing in the author's favor -- he does not speculate about prophecy."
4,Great Fun!,"I bought this game for my son who just turned six, and he absolutely loves it! After playing a few times, he's starting to learn the strategy behind the game, and how one has to look over the whole board before making a move. I feel like this game would be a good prelude for learning to play chess. I highly recommend it."
3,Instrumentals and more.,"Vocals: two tracks Tina Dico, two tracks Tracy Bonham, eight instrumentals. I guess it's rock with various influences - whatever it is, they do it well. Competent music and musicianship, I can't there's a bad track here. The lack of lyrics is really going to limit interest, but really, is your album collection really complete without an instrumental album?"
4,Fun and funny series,"This is a great series, fun stuff. I have seen the first few episodes and have enjoyed each one! if you like Maverick, you'll enjoy this series!!!"
3,Alias Smith and Jones Season 1,I love the show every episode. My rating is for the DVD 2 of the episodes are unwatchable due to the recording. I need to send it back. I loved the pilot episode which I had never seen.
5,More Stars Please!!,"This is a ten star book suitable for beginners as well as master quilters with its easy to follow, detailed instructions and patterns. Crazy Quilt Decor is packed cover to cover with clever one-of-a-kind projects which are beautifully photographed in full-color. This is a wonderful starter book for someone just trying their hand at Crazy quilting since there are many small projects to make such as a pillow or wall hanging. Overflowing with imaginative ideas and lots of great information, Marsha Michler's Crazy Quilt Decor is an awesome addition to any craft or quilting library. I highly recommend it.Nina Engelman <><"
5,the best rockabilly band in texas does it again!!!,"I have been fortunate to be there when these guys were just starting out several years ago and now it's hard to believe that their third cd is out. ""Love me like crazy"" was produced in california with the some of Big Sandy's Fly-Rite Boys behind the knobs and they definitley do not disappoint. The songs are more polished than the previous efforts but with the same raw energy that we all expect in a Cave Catt Sammy recording. If you are reading this and never have heard of these guys. Stop, right now and order this disc. Then e-mail me with want you think. I will guarantee you that Cave Catt Sammy can hold their own with any Rockabilly band in the land, and this latest disc reaffirms just that. ..."
1,Disappointment,"I got this for Christmas from my mom a few years ago. She thought it would be a great starter for me since I was young and would beg for it all the time! I got it and it worked great the first time although it was a little confusing for a kid. The second time it worked well. But after that it wouldn't work. My grandma (who is great with this type of stuff), My Aunt (loves to sew), and my stepdad (who has to sew and work with machines at his job), all tried fixing it. No one could fix it, no one could even figure out why it was acting up. 3 years later, after a lot of trying to work with it, it still won't work. All it does is one single stich and then it stops sewing and just pushes out a long line of thread. It's easy to work with, and it has a simple, easy to understand layout, it just simply doesn't work. Do not buy this product, unless you want to waste your money and be disapointed."
2,Like Walking in Mud,"The book is full of facts and quotes and could have been very informative. Unfortunately, it is also full of bias and inarticulate writing. If you want to read words you have never read before, or perhaps the longest sentences there are, read this book."
3,No sabe leer,"Este libro no hay uso porque no sabe bastante español para leyendo. Cuando aprendo más el español, me comprar este libro! Claro!"
1,Not enough information,"Not enough information. Very slim book, with little information. Basically, all of the information it contained I have found on websites."
3,"Great maps, otherwise common sense study skills...","Although this study guide includes great map activities, the actual chapter study sections are very elementary. I was disappointed as I was using this textbook for a graduate level course. The chapter study questions include a word/definition activity that I use in my 7th grade social studies classroom-- it asks the reader to write the textbook definition for each word followed by the definition in one's own words. I expected more depth/ ""meat"" from a collegiate study guide."
4,"A fun, lighthearted read........","""That Scandalous Evening"" was a pleasure to read...I wouldnt necessarily rank it up there with my all time favorites,but let me tell you...this book had some of the hottest love scenes I've ever read....When Ransom and Jane were intimate in the maze...Oh my....and in the attic..well..don't get me started...do yourself a favor and read this story!!!!"
3,Not that great.,"I have to quote a previous reviewer who said the following, "" It was difficult to fathom Jane's love for Ransom, a man who simply ignored her and found her quite pathetic during her debut year and after 11 years it was hard to believe that she was the 'one' for him all along. There was just no development of Ransom's love for Jane, and it seemed more one sided on Jane's part, which made her appear pathetic. Jane's constant pining for Ransom was just irritating until she finally developed some semblance of a backbone at the very end."" Nothing more to say."
2,Not one of her finest,"I have read many CD novels but this is not one of her finest. This was probably the first of her books that I have had difficulty finishing. I like my heroines strong and insensible about the right man, a man who earns her love, not one who is irritatingly senseless about a misogynistic cad. It was difficult to fathom Jane's love for Ransom, a man who simply ignored her and found her quite pathetic during her debut year and after 11 years it was hard to believe that she was the 'one' for him all along. There was just no development of Ransom's love for Jane, and it seemed more one sided on Jane's part, which made her appear pathetic. Jane's constant pining for Ransom was just irritating until she finally developed some semblance of a backbone at the very end.The only redeeming part about this book, which earned it one extra star, was the relationship between Lady Goodridge, Ransom's sister, and Fitz. At least one person had a spine, if not the heroine."
3,Not The Best They Could Do Better,I own this ppv and i got to say they could have done a little better with this one. Goldberg vs Sid had to be stopped by the ref allowing Goldberg to win the us title then go on to beat sting for the world title (which the next night he was stripped due to the fact it wasn't an offical WCW title match) And it was Hogan and Sting for the belt till hogan layed down in a weird moment in wrestling. Not the best Halloween Havoc but one we will remember take care
3,"Really should be called ""Creative Digital Manipulation""","I found the title and book description misleading in that the contents cover VERY little photographic technique and even less specific information on getting the most out of taking pictures with your digital camera. Instead, the bulk of the book focuses on what you can do with a digital image when creating a final product. On this acccount it appears to be quite thorough, and if you are a Photoshop wiz you might get alot of great ideas here. Also, to give it its due: the book is physically beautiful, and while it lacks editorial clarity, the images and layout are stunning.If you own a digital camera, and are looking for a title that will help you wade through the sea of camera settings and effects, I would start elsewhere."
3,Beware USED books - Drawings are NOT included!,"The book itself is generally good quality and well-written. I'm learning about construction & drawings for the very first time, so some info was hard for me to really understand - not enough explanation and, oh yeah - the DRAWINGS that are referred to throughout the ENTIRE book - uh... are NOT included! I HOPE someone sees this comment so that perhaps an addendum to the book's description could really warn buyers what they're in for by trying to save money on the used book. Honestly, you really lose at least half the value by not being able to refer to the plans...so: BUYER BEWARE!"
4,really good choice,i think this book should be read by alot of teenagers because its really similar to many of the situations in high school so i think that if you get a chance to read this you should u wouldnt be disapointed.
5,SHOP-VAC 8 GALLON 3.5-PEAK HP QUIET PLUS SERIES WET/DRY VACUUM,THIIS THE QUIETEST WET/DRY VAC I HAD I'V HAD THIS VAC OVER TWO YEARS AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT. I USE IT EVER DAY AROUND THE HOUSE AND ALOT OF TIMES TN MT BIG GARAGE AND WORK SHOP . JUST KEEP THE FILTER CLEAN AND YOU WILL NEVE ANY TROUBLE WITH IT. J.R.
5,Chantyman,"I fell in love with Glen Yarbrough's voice the Christmas of 1965 when I first heard his album Time to Move On. He is still my favorite vocalist and can make my heart soar along with his extraordinary voice. I am a former commercial fisherman, have lived the cruising life aboard a sailboat, and presently live aboard a classic cruiser. Imagine my delight to find a new album that combines songs of the sea with Glen's crystal clear melodic voice!"
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to recomend this book; unfortunately, I can't. While there's no doubt that Speed-McNeil is an excellent artist (her characters and settings appear effortlessly fluid), I found the story to have some real problems. The most prominent, the (future?) world this story entails is so deeply thought out that the author includes detailed footnotes in the back of the book giving further explanation and expanding on the concepts; unfortunately, I found that you also needed these footnotes to follow key plot points. While the author may improve in future volumes, I found this intial work frustrating and falling short of its true potential."
2,Grossly misrepresented!,"I purchased the Banzai version of this pool and found the pictures on the box to be grossly misrepresentative of the actual product. The product is 7ft from TAIL TO HEAD, however, the pool diameter is only 4ft from inside seam to inside seam. In the photo on the packaging, you see 3 children playing in the pool with plenty of room to spare. When my 2 1/2 year old and my 9 month old were playing, I could touch both of them with ease. I guess I'll see how 3 - 3 year olds fit on Labor day, but I don't see them fitting with the same ease of the models."
5,a must read,"for anyone with someone they know that has dementia this is a must read book, easy to read informative and thoughtfull"
5,Wonderful book,"By giving you an understanding of how the person with alzheimers views their world, this book helps the caregiver make life a little easier, happier, and more meaningful. It also reduces the stress and frustration of the caregiver because you gain knowledge of how to handle situations that before were a struggle."
5,Great product,This seems to fit the bill for what was needed I was keeping my Xbox 360 slim in my entertainment center and there was no ventilation so I was afraid it would over heat so I purchased this product due to its open design... The amount storage was just icing on the cake!!!
5,Need answers to cholesterol questions,"I've been following the Protein Power Plan for 2 1/2 months. Thrilled with the weight loss and loss in measurements. But, today I got my cholesterol count, first time ever, it was 401. I was shocked. Does anyone have any encouragement for me? Of course, I don't know what my count was before starting the Plan. I can't bear the thought of going back to low-fat, high carb. Please E-Mail me."
1,Dangerous Long-Term Effects,"When I first discovered the Protein Power Plan I thought this was a great alternative to a low-fat diet. However, after several months of strictly adhering to the program I lost about 14 pounds, but began experiencing distressing physical side effects. After three months my menstrual cycle stopped and after three more months I began having acute insomnia and irregular heartbeats. The insomnia continued (only could sleep 2 to 4 hours per night restlessly) for about four months until I was totally dangerously physically depleted. Only after I went back to a balanced diet recommended by ""normal"" nutritionists did I begin to recover my physical health.I strongly recommend that you do not follow this dietary plan."
1,Didn't work for me!,"I went on this diet after having read the book thoroughly. I stuck to the diet for three weeks and lost NOTHING! Not only did I NOT lose weight, but I had terrible bad breath, a constant metal-like taste in my mouth, and suffered from bad body odor (nothing I had a problem with previously). I have since resurrected my Weight Watchers booklets and am now happily returning to lots of veggies AND fruit, yogurt, whole grains and lean meats and cheeses. I feel so much better! What a wasted three weeks!"
1,Really Amazon? Really...,"This low mark isn't for the book...it's amazing. Following this book dropped my blood pressure from hypertensive levels to 90/60, dropped my weight, had all my blood levels looking great, and most of all makes me feel outstanding and full of energy. I was getting this book for my spouse because it worked so well for me.The bad mark is because Amazon increased the price of the book by more than $2.50 just in the time since adding the book to my basket to checkout. That's shady, Amazon...shame on you."
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!,"I have started and stopped this diet a few times, but finally I stayed on it for a whole week. And was I suprised! I had lost 18 lbs. in one week. I believe this is something I can stick with for the rest of my life. I started out at 385 lbs. and I'm on a dead run for 225. Thank you and God bless."
4,"The "" I'm not hungry anymore"" Diet Book","No more hunger, starving, or feeling deprived. The book Protein Power tells a person how to eat and lose weight . I have used it for 6 months and lost 62 lbs. Its more than a diet. It changes your way of eating without leaving you with a feeling of loss for your old way of eating. Dr. Eades book only works if you work. There is no magic formula, just proven fact. Great way to lose and maintain for life"
5,Fantastic Work!,"The authors state that this book is an expansion on the previous low-carb research that came before it. Atkins was good but the Eades' are even better. In depth explanations of the underlying science is right there, and an easy to follow guide. Very well written."
5,"Outstanding, the only life style change plan that's sensible","The best plan I have ever encountered to change my diet lifestyle. The explanations and historical documentation about insulin gave me a big eye opener. Meeting every one of their high risk catagories I had no trouble deciding that this was something I needed to do. It has been very easy to stay on, and I'm not looking forward to anytime when I can have that cake, I just don't feel the need for it, nor potatoes, nor bread. I think its just great."
5,Star power!,"This book has so many easy to understand concepts...I've started the plan, and feel great. Am looking forward to dropping some serious weight and regaining my health...and the best part...no hunger pangs!"
4,4 stars for controversy!!,"This book was recommended in Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom/Christiane Northup --also an excellent book. What fascinates me most about Protein Power is how the people who didn't like this book are so passionate, going so far as to submit thier reviews OVER AND OVER AGAIN, and writing vicious and cruel things at anyone whose opinion was different (example: A3435@aol.com on 12/1/98 and Nov 98). On the other hand, everyone who liked the book seems pretty rational and happy . . .What does THAT say??It says a lot to me."
3,Not Quite There,"With masterpieces such as Airships and Ray under his belt, Barry Hannah's 1991 novel Never Die comes as somewhat of a disappointment. Hannah is no doubt one of the most fascinating writers writing in America today but his best work of the 1990s has to be found in short story collections like Bats Out of Hell and High Lonesome.Never Die takes place in the decaying and dying Old West at the beginning of the 20th century, and it is thus a part of a developing trend in southern fiction which focuses on the American West. The novel is filled with bizarre and grotesque characters, but unfortunately the story gets lost in this post-modern puzzle of honor and revenge. However, Hannah can still shock and amaze through his language. It is not a bad novel, but knowing that Hannah can do (and has done) much better, it seems only halfway there."
5,Great Childhood Memories,Awesome! I'm getting this from Santa for Christmas cuz he always knows what ya want! Was shipped very fast! Cant wait!
5,Excellent Teaching Tool,This book is a wonderful toool for teaching vovabulary to reluctant readers. My students enjoy reading it and have been able to retain and use the vocabulary properly that is targeted in the book.
3,The 1976 Solo Keyboard Album,"Give George Duke credit on this effort. To be able to play all the instruments at any level of competence is an accomplishment.Based on the recommendation of others, I took a chance on this album.My take? Not bad, not bad at all. But, as I am a 'funk' fan of his, this album doesn't touch 'Reach for it.' Thus the three stars rating.Maybe you'll think differently. I rate this work 3 stars."
1,Buyer beware,"The parts to this item were poorly made, and the holes did not match up for assembly. The coat rack stood at about a 45 degree angle with the floor. Very disappointing. I'm sending it back."
1,Terrible Quality,"I opened up the package and everything seemed fine. The wood was a beautiful color, all of the pieces seemed to be there. However, i noticed that two of the pieces were plastic and was a little bummed. Then I started putting everything together and was extremely frustrated and disappointed. The legs are all different sizes so I had to make my own screw holes. The rings (which are plastic) don't fit. I was able to force the bottom one, but when I got to the top, I couldn't make it work. My coat rack is now sans top ring which makes the top hooks not as sturdy as they should be. And finally since nothing fit or was the same size, it is crooked.It was a waste of money and time."
1,coat rack,"not as sturdy as it looks on line. not the best for an office enviornement for multi-user use. probably best suited for a children's bedroom with light weight restrictions. Item was returned, not for us."
5,Attractive and Functional,"I've had mine for a couple of years. Maybe if I'd had to put it together myself I'd be p.o.'d too. But I didn't, and I've loved having it. I used to come home from work and unencumber myself, tossing stuff on the table or backs of chairs. This coat rack was a perfect step toward reforming my cluttering behavior. If I can't manage to get to the closet, I can start tossing my jackets, sweaters, caps, scarves, briefcase, shopping bags, etc onto the tree. It holds quite a lot. It has tipped over a few times, but any reasonable person could see it had way too much stuff on it. Every so often I take stuff off it and reacquaint myself with coat hangers, closet, cabinets and drawers. Having this tree has been a fair compromise between being a total slob and feeling a voice from my childhood nagging me to put my stuff away. It gives me a breather till I feel ready to put on my skirt and pearls and play domestic goddess like Mamma taught me."
5,"Another ""must have"" Southern cookbook",This is the cookbook I can pull out and count on to produce a wonderful dish every single time. I haven't come across a dud yet. Martha Pearl is delightful (and yes I AM hinting for a dinner invitation) and so are her recipes. The macaroni and cheese is a family favorite that already has stains on the page because I make it so often. The pecan coffee cake is another recipe I have made many times and always get compliments on. I live near Charlotte and keep hoping to run into Jimmy and Martha Pearl picking over the Silver Queen corn at the farmer's market. I would unabashedly tell her what a devoted fan she has made of this transplanted Yankee.
2,A half cooked booked - very avoidable,"I found the book to be lacking what it takes to teach photography. It feels and is very superficial. And almost embarassingly, quite a few photographs are second rate - definitely not expected from a proven photographer.The text accompanying the pictures is without life and soul.I went to local store and compared this book to other titles by John Hedgecoe such as ""The manual of photography"" and ""The photographer's handbook"". They are both far far superior to this mediocre work.A very avoidable title that will serve no purpose on your bookshelf.A word of caution- I believe this book is not same as the more acclaimed ""The Book of Photography"". I haven't seen that title and thought you'd like to know lest you confuse between two very similar titiles by the same author - something I find in bad taste. Is John and DK trying to make money by this ""trick""?"
2,Uninspiring and poorly explained,"I'm afraid I found this book uninspiring and confusing when I was given it as a beginner. Some time after I bought John Shaw's series of books which really put me on the right track. John Hedgecoe fails to explain the principles clearly. Each page is full of unimportant detail, for instance, as a beginner one is left wondering why he used a 6x6 camera in one set up and a 35mm in another. Although, studio set-ups are illustrated, nowhere in the book is there a proper dicussion of contrast and exposure latitudes of films. My advice is look elsewhere."
5,One book for four subjects,"The Spiritual Study of the Tarot is a unique book as it incorporates the studies of Astrology, Numerology, and the Kabalah into one book and shows how they all relate to the Tarot cards. Each subject is discussed in depth. Each card in the Major and Minor Arcana is described in detail. Each decoration on the card has a meaning and the author describes in detail what they all mean. The Tarot Associations recommend this book for the study of the Tarot. The Rider Waite deck of cards are used. This book sells out very fast in all store. Order one now!"
2,Not so good as it first looks,"Initially I thought that this book was great, one of the few Tarot books that combined the Tarot, Kabbalah, numerology, symbology and astrology. But on closer reading I found that the author had copied chunks of text from the classic tarot book ""The Tarot"" by Paul Foster Case without either refering to Case or explaining his comments further. This is pretty disgraceful, I think they call it plaigiarism."
2,Good to read once.,"This is the kind of book you should read once if you know nothing about a router. You can do it in a library, or glance through it in a bookstore.That's about it. There is nothing really wrong with the book, and the pictures are really good. It's just that the information is so basic and limited, that you are ready to move on very soon."
2,Disappointed,"Hmmm. I was looking for a worthwhile book offering tips, jigs, and general routing knowledge. Not here. First, the book is British. Not a bad thing if you're British, but I was hoping to read about American products and practices. Second, what's here is just flat out weak. I'm being generous by giving it 2 stars."
2,Not quite as pictured.,"The fireplace screen pictured online shows very defined decorative scrollwork. This actual feature is on the backside of the frame with a dark screen overlaid in front of it. This almost hides all of the design, especially when placed in front of my fireplace with a surround of black granite. I would return the screen but it is very large and heavy and I don't want to pay for the postage involved. Guess I'll have to learn to live with it even though it is not what I expected."
3,"Nice, but Kitty inexplicably doesn't like","I purchased these because they were a fantastic value. Heretofore, I had been spending about $5 per week on play mice, but my kitty doesn't like these nearly as much as she likes her old ones. She'll play with them, but she prefers her old ones, which she finds every now and then. It's nice to have so many, nonetheless, and if I shake them around in bag of catnip first she likes them fine. My roommate's cat doesn't like them very much either, but the puppy surely does love to eat them!"
1,worthless,"i ordered this router thinking it was the one i needed. I received it,tested it, didn't work.emailed the seller, no reply whatsoever. worst seller ever.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON."
3,Questionable Thesis,"Zagorin's thesis is that the key to the West's religious tolerance is the large body of theoretical/political/philosophical writings supporting tolerance -- writings that give the idea more heft, cultural significance, and endurance than it could have had without them. True enough, but in order to suggest this body of writings as the key to our heritage of tolerance, Zagorin explicitly downplays the significance of two other keys: 1) the spread of disbelief/skepticism, and 2) the fears, the political and economic instability, and the human tragedies created by religious wars. But the evidence he presents shows that these two were precisely what inspired the body of writings! Even Sebastian Castellio, Zagorin's ""hero"" in this book, speaks again and again about the obscurity and difficulty of the doctrines of baptism, predestination, and trinity, and how the difficulty leads to disbelief and therefore controversy and therefore pain and suffering. A pleasant but unimportant book."
4,Scooby Boo?,"Scooby and the gang are on their way to a movie when one of the Mystery Machine's tires blows out. They plan on putting on the spare only to discover that Shaggy and Scooby have replaced the tire with their ""survival kit"". The gang sees a mansion on the hill and treks to the door to see if they can use the phone, arriving just before a terrible storm. The owner's phone is out because of the storm but insists that they stay for dinner. Several guests are in attendance, but when the lights go out, the man who owns the castle disappears and in his place is a ghost!This book is a fast read (for just about any age level) and feels just like a Scooby cartoon. I loved the illustrations that accompany the text. A book that just about any Scooby fan will enjoy."
4,A good book on computational geometry & visualization,"This book provides a computational geometry visualization library, covering topics that I had a hard time finding good resources for. Solid modeling, swept/extruded surfaces, and boolean operations are all explained. Overall, I liked the presentation; my only complaints are that the book reads a little like a translation (the authors are apparently Austrian) and that the sample programs on the CD(and there are a lot of them!) could be a little better documented."
2,Good camcorder but with some problems,"The SCD67 continues to have problems with its keeping date/time settings. It will revert back to Jan 1, 2001, every so often. I had the unit replaced but the new unit also has the same problem.The picture quality, if you can ignore the date/time settings, is excellent."
1,be prepared for agro,"I bought this camcorder two years ago, and it's needed to be repaired twice. Now the LCD monitor is broken. Samsung customer service is extremely poor and built around avoiding honoring the warranty at all costs"
4,Great Single,"It is so simple to say that this is a collection of great songs. All in all, not thier best, but still very good. If your a Weezer fan, it's worth a buy."
4,"Good reception, longer battery life","This device found satellites and pinpointed its location on the map in less than a minute out of the box -- from inside the house, where my previous GPS (a Magellan Explorist) hadn't even been able to get any reception. Battery life has been much better than earlier units I've owned.Usability outside the US is an important feature for me. When we went to Europe, we were able to buy a detailed map of Scandinavia on a micro card so that we could just bike around Copenhagen without worrying about getting lost."
5,Best GPS receiver I've ever used,I was showing my new toy off at a gathering of GPS type people and the little gem managed to lock on to a signal inside in a metal roof building. It is just that good.
1,Garbage!,"My Garmin will NOT talk to either of my PCs, making it impossible to load maps, waypoints, etc. - and the maps that come with it are useless. If you want good maps, be prepared to shell out $100, and then cross your fingers and hope that your GPS and PC will talk to each other.Garmin's technical support has been useless. All they say is ""uninstall and reinstall the drivers!"" I've wasted HOURS doing this and it DOES NOT HELP. For the last month or so, Garmin's technical support has COMPLETELY IGNORED ME. I will never buy anything from them again. I would rate it zero stars, but that was not an option."
4,a bit small for Honda Odyssey,"It is a bit small for Honda Odyssey, but other than that, I am very happy with this purchase. It is very sturdy, and does not look tacky at all."
4,Enjoyable Read,"If you like a cozy read, then you will love this. Valerie Wolzien once again manages to keep you on your toes with this book. I was totally surprised by the ending of this book. I read this while I was on vacation at the beach, and I have to admit that I could not put it down. I promise that once you pick it up, you will not want to put it down. It is an enjoyable read."
2,Three was not a Charm,I discovered Dunning and immediately read the first two mysteries. They were wonderful as my reviews indicate. I was anxious to start The Bookman's Promise. I tried but it just never got going. Other reviewers have described the book so I will not repeat the story. I can not figure out why there really is any interest in the story. The book lags and the long historical section does not move the story forward.One part of the series that is getting tiresome is that everyone who is favorable is a book lover.I will take a break now from Dunning before I continue with the series.
4,Promise to the Dead,"THE BOOKMAN'S PROMISE by John Dunning lacks the smashing style of previous editions of the series. Ciff Janeway make a promise to a dying woman to locate her grandfather's collection of the works of Richard Francis Burton. Others have the same goal and will commit murder to find the missing collection before Janeway.Good story, fine bibliographical information, but a slow moving story.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,john dunning's newest left me sad,"I am a fan of Mr. Dunning's character Cliff Janeway, but I found this book a bit more maudline than past tomes. It was well written and interesting as always but the over all tone of the book was what really struck me. It was a ""sad"" book to me. The death of his friend's wife and the duty to the book owner, it was all a little too heady for me at the time i read it.This in no way deters me from awaiting the next Janeway adventure."
5,Worth every penny,"This is the 17th Shun knife I've purchased either for myself of as gifts, and I truly believe that you get your money's worth with Shun knives. They are far superior to Wusthof and Henckels without question. I haven't tried the Global knives yet for a direct comparison, but I'm pretty sure I'd still be happy with the extra money I spent on the Shuns.One of the lesser-known features of these knives is that you can ship them back to Shun to be factory sharpened at any point. We've only taken advantage of this once, but it's a great little extra service."
5,This book should be in print,"This title is currently out of print but, it may be able to be found on a remainder table. Each major battle and campaign has a clearly set out map along with several illustrations, both photographs and drawings. The maps are in color and the drawings are too. There is accompanying text as well as full, clear captions. I hope that another edition of this book is printed since it is a beautiful volume that is clear both as to illustrations and text."
5,WORKED ON GERANIUM BUDWORMS; NEEDED MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS,"We have potted geraniums outside of our windows. Some months ago, we discovered that budworms were eating the buds and leaves. We tried the powdered form of this product that would not dispense properly and we returned it to Amazon.This liquid form did work but note that the process required an application about every ten days for more than two months to get rid of all the worms. We gather that this formula does not attack eggs in the soil, so all of the worms had to hatch and actually ingest the product before it becomes completely effective.Recommended."
5,Safer Brand 5160 Caterpillar Killer with BT - 8-Ounce Concentrate,This product eliminated the Hornworms that were destroying my tomato plants. I only had to use it one time and haven't seen another Hormworm.
2,Read This Book and Lost Anyway,"While I cannot point to any specific guarantees in this book, I still felt disappointed that I used various strategies they suggest and lost in Las Vegas. Thank goodness I followed at least one of their suggestions and set a gambling budget.I managed to lose every nickel of it.I guess if there was value in the book, I did not look like a total idiot playing table games in a casino."
2,MAC Foundaton,it has a smell and it is not the correct color i thought it would be. I will not buy it again. Going to Macy's.
1,Is this real Mac Makeup?,"I was disappointed with this makeup. I bough one at Mac Store, (same color I ordered here @ amazon)... well, you get what you pay for. This is not the same color, I put it on and it seems I have a sunburn on my face and it's not the same quality. So, next time, I'd rather pay a higher price for the real thing, instead of trying to save money and getting something 'wannabe'."
3,excelente product,Excelent productcumplio con lo esperado en calidad y tiempo en la entrega.contento con el servicio entregado por el proveedormuchas gracias
3,Really?,Lol if its fake just because it comes with a sponge why is it on thier site? N i have nt used this product but once i find out my color im trying it.
1,MUY CLARO TOTALMENTE DISTINTO AL COLOR QUE MUESTRA,"TOTALMENTE EN DESACUERDO AL COLOR QUE FIGURA, YO TENIA EL MISMO CODIGO Y ES UN TONO MUCHO MAS OSCURO AL QUE RECIBI. NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CON EL PRODUCTO, MUY CLARO CON RESPECTO AL QUE YO YA TENIA SIENDO QUE LOS DOS SON EL MISMO CODIGO."
3,Disappointing Beethoven from a conductor I usually like,"I'm afraid I agree with the fellow who found the sound of these recordings dim--details in the strings and woodwinds remain unclear even after hours of fiddling with an equalizer. I agree that Karajan's and Toscanini's Beethoven are the pits, and I'd rather listen to Muti's Beethoven given the choice. There is no denying the beauty of the playing. Still, Muti is too much of a romantic for Beethoven--those subtle changes of tempo that are so effective and necessary in Tchaikovsky (Muti's is among the best) in Beethoven become fussy, distracting and effeminate, weakening forward momentum. I wish I liked this set--the price is certainly right--but..."
5,The music of Beethoven is brought to life.,The sound of hearing Beethoven is given new meaning due to the raw sound of the orchestra. Beethoven is provided the respect in that he deserves in this top quality composition.
5,amazing,"I just got back from a trip to Ireland and had picked this up in a record store. I'd heard of the band (big fan of ""The Commitments"" and any good bio of the cast lists Glen Hansard's formation of the Frames). I had no clue how good this cd was going to be! I have listened to it non-stop, a feat previously only held by Damien Rice. Absolutely amazing - one of the best live discs I've heard, you can hear the smiles on faces of the musicians, particularly in the vocals. Going to to buy another Frames cd right now, in fact..."
1,Not compatible with Photoshop CS/Painter 8 on Panther (OS X),Based on reviews I purchased this product just to find out from Corel that it is not compatible with Photoshop CS and Corel's own Painter 8 under OS X 10.3 (Panther). They don't even have an estimate if and when they will fix the problem.
5,Palm One cable,cable was in excellent condition. Unfortunately found out the software is no longer supported by windows 7 and higher. Quick turn around.
3,"Very good product, but...","This cable is the exact same thing from what you get in the m100 box. It's useful for people who work with their palm in their office and at home. I highly recommend it for people who don't want to unplug their first cable and bring it with them. It's also an important item when the first one breaks by accident!Ok so buy it if you absolutely need it!My only concern is that the price is a little bit high. All of Palm's products are higher than expected. They are higher because it's somewhat new. The stylis, peripherals, the cameras, cases, covers, programs, and add-ons are over-priced!"
2,"Long on theory, short on practicum","Somewhat disjointed. You can see where later editions were added on. It doesn't really speak to the electronic specifics of the Zenith TA. It talks a lot about history and the AA5. Truthfully, I'd skip it."
2,Overrated.,"Book could have been very good. The prologue was outstanding but the book went downhill... The book is way too long and the writing is stilted. Dr. Jonathan Cray as the evil psychatric hospital director is right out of central casting. The premise presented in the synopsis is interesting, the book sadly, was not."
4,suspenseful,"Just finished reading this. Suspenseful, keep you on the edge of your seat book! Unexpected suprise twist in the story. Definitely recommend!"
3,Pretty Good Action,It was a fairly good story. Strong characters that you could care about. Pretty good at writing action. The ending was good.
2,Not my speed,"Serial Killer books are typically not my taste. It sounded interesting, I read the sample and since it only costs $.99, I figured I would see where the story goes. I guessed 1/2 of what was going to happen, the writing was ok, but the story was just really weak and I only finished it to see if the killer was going to get caught and who would figure it out."
1,What did I miss??,"This was a great read, until the heroine was burried and the villain is alive in chapter 43 then she is inexplicably brought back to life and the villain killed.!!! I don't get it. Did I get a erroneous draft of this, book or what? How did this get five stars with this literary disconnect?"
1,Don't think I'll even be able to finish,"Since I've purchased my Kindle I've read from 2-3 books per week, until I loaded this book. I have not picked up the Kindle for two weeks as I don't think I can read another page. The villan is loathsome and the heroine (?) is an idiot. I usually try to finish a book no matter how disappointing but I truly wish they had killed each other in the first chapter and just gotten it over with."
2,Too much back story,"I read another one of this author's books a while back and it was pretty good, this book however has too much back story in between the action sequences, I found myself paging forward to skip the back story to get to the action. I think I only read half of the book and that half was not worth reading."
2,Not my kind of story,"Sorry, I love to read but just couldn't get into this one.Slow to start and seemed to be going no where."
3,Stealing faces,"Rather unusual topic! but when we read on, it is the same thing with a twist.The philosophical comments are kind of interesting but rather pessimistic.Not bad, but not great."
4,sponge bob movies are always a hit,"sponge bob movies are a great way to keep grandchildren (or children if you're not as old as I am) happy and occupied while doing things that need them to be away from underfoot (fixing supper, cleaning, etc.) the children enjoy watching them and there is very little violence or obsenity in any of them!"
5,Amazing camera,"I've had this camera for almost three weeks, and I love it. The pictures it takes are fantastic. At high-res my 8x10s come out beautiful. Even at low-res ( with low compression ) the photos are great.The best shots are outdoors. Landscapes come out great. It needs decent light indoors, but it has a strong flash.There are a lot of settings to help you get a good shot, and you can review your picture before you move on, so you can take another one if you need to. The macro lense is great. Although you can't set the apature or shutter priority, you can trick the camera into giving you ""advanced"" photos.Understand that if you buy this camera, you're going to spend another $100 on accessories. A battery charger ( NiMH ) and a few sets is a must. And so is more memory, unless you won't ever use the camera away from a computer."
5,No Problems with Batteries,"In most of the reviews I have seen, the biggest concern has been battery life. I have to tell you that batteries are not a problem so long as you get good ones with high capacity. I have the Olympus Battery package which I got from Amazon . . .. The package comes with 4 AA 1600mAhr batteries. I charged them on 6 February, did a trip to Belize, took about 150 pictures which I was showing to all the people in our group every night.We only had power on our island for 2 hours in the morning and two hours in the evening, so I could not chagre them again, and so I brought some regular AA's for backup. It is now 25 Feb, and I have just finished editing the shots down to about 100 that I want to keep, and I am still working on the initial battery charge. The backup AA's I brought are still in the sealed package."
5,"D490 Olmpus, Amazon and Vipmart","I thought this might be of help to those of you who are nervous about buying on line and especially buying a refurb camera. The Olympus I bought came from Vipmart via the Amazon link. I also puchased a new Olympus 128mb smart card with it. I got a good price on the card but I stole the D-490! The ad said, the camera had slight scratches on it and it was a refurb for $139.00 The scratches were so slight I had a hard time finding them and it works great! I also found that when hooked up through your VCR your can record unlimited movies! I have not found my old mikes with RCA jacks yet but I'm convinced It will record the audio as well. I wonder why they don't advertise this fact? On the con side... They didn't send me the strap! Oh well, I gotta complain about something don't I?"
3,Unassisted Suicide.,"Like others, I have absolutely loved my Olympus D-490 Zoom digital camera -- until now. I have seen several reviews in this list reporting a sudden and unexpected electrical death of the camera. I am now mourning just that same event. Love ya, Olympus, but I fear I cannot now trust ya!"
5,Another great purchase,"This product is awesome. The unique ""no rinse formula"" seals the deal! I have used several other cook top cleaners and this one in my opinion is the best for me. This product leaves a high gloss and no residue. Cleaning with a cloth versus a paper towel yields the best results. Using a cloth enables the use of a smaller amount of cleasing cream, which still does a fantastic job. This product leaves my cook top looking brand spanking new."
1,Failed attempt at comedy,"Poirot as a comedy? Hm. Perhaps if it had been directed well, and if the plot hadn't been so mercilessly murdered, and if Poirot hadn't been as miscast, it might have had survived. Alas, it is a bizarre hodgepodge of sketches and spoofs, none of them particularly funny. I can't quite comprehend why a wonderful actor like Robert Morley agreed to play the role of Hastings in this movie.Overall, I would avoid it and go for the real thing - David Suchet, who managed to play the role faithfully, with charm and character."
1,Tony Randall a Good Actor Was Badly Miscast Here!,"Tony Randall as Hercule Poirot? You've got to be kidding? I liked Tony Randall in movies like Pillow Talk and he was great as Felix Unger in the Odd Couple TV show but he is no Poirot and he is definitely no David Suchet who all Poirot's will forever be measured, and after him Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney! Tony is just badly miscast as Poirot he's too tall, too skinny, etc, I also want to point out that Tony Randall is not the terrible actor the other reviewers are suggesting he is but he was just not right for tthe roll of Porot! Even though I'm not sure if he would have made a good Poirot they should have cast Robert Morley as Poirot and Tony Randall as Hastings and maybe it would have made a little more sense!"
5,Outstanding,"You can ALWAYS count on Bob's Red Mill (at least I can) for quality products - these are no exception! Uniform, great quality, great flavor, consistent - perfect with peanut butter on pumpernickel (my personal favorite) - high in protein! Pumpkin seeds are my new ""health food"" and Bob's makes them great; a reasonable price for a great product! I've found them pricier, but not any better. I'll be buying these from now on."
5,eat them up Yum!,I sprinkle these on Oat Groats or just grab a handful and munch. I transferred the contents of the package to a ziplock once I opened it and keep it in the freezer to ensure freshness.
4,Interesting to say the least,"If you've read anything by Gertrude Stein before, you'll know that Three Lives and Tender Buttons is no different from her way of looking at an object and writing the vaguest but also most detailed descriptions of what something is. It's an interesting read, but a little confusing and disheartening to try the first time through."
5,Inside Chiropractic: A must read text,"I have just finished reading Dr. Homola's recent book Inside Chiropractic. Dr. Homola has once again adequately demonstrated the current problems that exist in the profession called chiropractic. In 1963, Dr. Homola was the lone voice in identifying the problems the chiropractic profession had. His work of 1963, Bonesetting, Chiropractic, and Cultism has been the influence for constructive reform that is so badly needed for the chiropractic profession. It is interesting to note that many of the current problems Dr. Homola discussed in 1963 are still prevalent 36 years later. Dr. Homola's book is a must read book for anyone contemplating either a career in chiropractic or wishing to understand the workings of the profession. Timothy A. Mirtz DC Lawrence, Kansas"
1,Misinformation can have an extensive bibliography,Samuel Homola and Stephen Barrett have been using chiropractic as their whipping boy to garner media attention for years. This book is yet another wild falsehood. There is overwhelming scientific evidence for the efficacy and safety of chiropractic....
4,Disney Gets Cheap,"The Three Little Pigs is of course a cartoon classic. The sound quality on this video, however, is very poor. It is difficult to make out all of the words, and the wonderful music is muddy. Disney could have spent a few bucks to remaster the sound, especially since they've long since recouped their costs on this."
5,Excellent Book,"I bought this book for a class I was taking. The version of the book was a year older than the rest of the class was using but not much changed in the new version so I was able to keep up and get an ""A"""
5,Watch it with your kids. Several times.,"Outstanding series. So much to contemplate, but Professor Cox is the perfect teacher. I will watch it again with the kids. Probably a couple times. Well done."
3,"these new instant copies of this book are really poor quality, better to buy a used original, easier to read","apparently this book is printed digitally on demand to fill orders now, but the quality of the whole book is pretty bad. badly scanned cover, out of focus, and not color corrected show the cheapness of the product. the type inside is so heavy that it make it slightly hard to read. the book itself is amazing, i recommend this book to everyone, but you are better off buying a used copy that was printed as books should be rather than this awful distorted instant copy. i'm glad i didn't pay full price. i bought them to give as gifts to friends to introduce them to harry crews, but the quality is so bad i'm a bit embarrassed by the overall cheapness of quality. i won't make that mistake again."
2,Hardly Definitive,"Well, like most tributes and memorial services I've ever been to, they end up reflecting just a pale shadow of the loved one and inevitably leave you missing the real person all the more. Many of this magnificent artist's by far not greatest films just sort of all thrown together (mostly just two or three stars at best) as well as a few of the truly great ones -- The Hustler and The Verdict. Buy those two to watch over and over and rent the others to watch once, but sheesh. This collection sure is hardly definitive. Just some big quick bucks for some big corporation. Yawn."
4,I love the weird ones!,"This book is cool, I've been to two of the museums already and I'm adding the others to my TO DO list, but BE WARNED. This book was published in 1997 and a new edition is out. I wish I had noticed that before I put this one on my wishlist and received it. If you're interested in these crazy museums (and you really should be) get the updated version of this book and enjoy!"
5,Mysims DS rocks!!!!!,I just got this game today at GameStop and it is wicked awsome. I LOVE it. As you all know this game has had more hype for the Wii version but the DS version is just as fun. The only thing is you can't build houses in the DS version but thats not a problem because there is so much fun stuff to do. I HIGHLY and DEFINATLY recomend this game. When I get a Wii I will DEFINATLY get the Wii version of this game it's so much fun. I like it better than the regular sims.
4,"Not the best Sims, but not the worst either!","If you are true Sims lover and have ever played on PS2 or PC, this game is probably not for you. But if you have a kid that wants to play your Sims games on PS2 or PC and you don't want them to because of the sexual content, etc etc, BUY THEM THIS GAME! I bought this for my 8 yr old who always wants to play my games on PS2 and PC but I am uncomfortable with some of the content. The solution? I got her a DS Lite and some games like this one. SHE LOVES IT! It's just her speed. She gets to create a Sim and create the clothes and decorate the house and go on tiny little Sim missions, only this game is so mild you don't have to worry about any kind of adult content. I'm an avid Sims lover and I've even played the game a few times out of pure boredom and it's not too bad just not as good or indepth as the other versions. Bottom line, my kids love it."
2,My CheckWriter Personal Account Review,"This software program was easy to install, The instructions on designing new checks was a little confusing but after two attempts I was able to design my checks. However I could not get the software and my version of Quicken to integrate. Because of this and other incompatability problems with the software and my equipment I was unable to print checks. Troubleshooting through the software, or my version of Quicken proved to be of no help. Here is a list of the equipment and software I used: HP Pavillion, HP DeskJet 648C printer, Quicken Basic, and MyCheckWriter Personal Account."
1,Horrible!,"Like previous reviewers, I could not get the product to print and I have a laser printer! It has been a total waste of time. Customer support is practically non-existent. I've yet to hear from my last inquiry after the first support reply didn't work."
5,A great book about what it says it's about,"As the book itself says, this isn't a comprehensive study of the ABB. What it is is a nice series of cronological essays about Willie's time with and around the ABB. It is a quick but satifying read and a must for any fan of the ABB or music of the late 60s and 70s. It is a nice view into those lived it."
4,Exersocks for guys?,"I saw one of the ladies in my Pilates class wearing these and thought I would give them a try. Being the only heterosexual male in the class, it took a leap of faith and lots of sexual self-confidence to try them. But, just like the football players who wear pantyhose to keep warm during outside winter play, these socks did live up to expectations. They give reasonably good traction on a smooth floor (better than bare feet but less than sneakers) while allowing foot flexibility during certain movements. They would earn 5 stars if they had a less feminine look."
5,ExerSocks Rock!,"These socks are great. Comfy and have a surprising amount of grip. I have always been a fin of slipper socks and when I was in the market for some new ones I came avross these. Slipper socks always have those grippy things on them but the socks always slide about. These stay put on my feet and actually grip. I have yet to try them for yoga but for walking around the house they are great. My feet stay warm and comfy.The only downside to them, and it is a downside that all men face when it comes to socks however, is that the sizing is a bit......well....the size covers too many show sizes. I am borderline on the size I bought, but I think the next size up will be way too large.But overall, I will be buying more!"
5,If You Can Take the Heat Get Out of the Kitchen,This is one of the best DVD players you can get. It has an easy to use remote and the picture and sound are great. Its sleek design will look good any place you wish to put it. This one is hot!
3,Broke after 4 months,"Ordered this DVD player for christmas present for my wife. Worked really well for a while, but after only 4 months of fairly light usage, it had decided to call it quits. Seems to be some sort of problem with the parent lock on it. No longer can display a menu on any DVD, and will only play ones that are rated PG and lower. very strange."
2,"Works fine in the beginning, but...","We bought this DVD player last Christmas. In the first I'd say 9 months after about 40 DVDs, it stopped playing the newest DVDs we rent from blockbuster. It always stuck before the menu shows up. I've seen similar comments before and I guess this is a built-in mistake. Now we are 5 days away from the deadline of the warrenty and we are going to call the service to see how it goes. Strangely, everything else works fine and it can easily play Video CDs. That is why we didn't discover the problem with DVDs earlier.So use your money for something else..."
1,A Disappointing Product,"Update:My Pioneer DVD has now been in the shop recommended by Pioneer for over three months. The parts required to repair my DVD have still not been provided by Pioneer. No more Pioneer products for me!Original Review:I am very disappointed with my Pioneer DVD Player DV-333. After playing approximately 20 DVDs during a period of seven months it has failed. I called customer service 1-800-421-1404 and the representative told me where to take the unit for service. A call to the service people told me that it would take ten days to two weeks service if no parts were required and a month if service was required.Obviously the critical parts on this Pioneer system were not burned in. We got an early unnecessary failure. What a waste of money! As an engineer who has acquired over sixty patents and put a lot of products into production, I know this failure did not have to happen. Pioneer has disappointed me."
2,bad bad bad,"I just started the book (randomly, at US Presidents), and, after looking at just three pages I've found an error. Not a typo, an error. This is bad. How can I possibly trust the rest of information in the book?"
5,Great preparation for Trivia contests & Game shows!,"This book has tons of relevant trivia in a handy format.Many of the questions from Jeopardy and Quiz bowl could be taken directly from this book.I really appreciate the layout of this book. It makes reviewing very fast and efficient. There are some typos and mispellings, but the wealth of knowledge here more than makes up for it.I am studying for a trivia competition and I really feel that this book is giving me a competitive edge. Presidents, Literature, Movies, it's all here. Well worth everypenny and much better than many other books I looked at!"
3,Restoration / Preservation toolbox standard,"I found this product to be suitable for light rust conversion. Note: you must fully remove all rust scale for the product to be fully effective. I have used this and similar products repeatedly for auto and sheet metal preservation and restoration jobs. It does a good job of sealing metal pores after grinding and sanding away all surface rust. My typical uses include post-welding work, needle grinding, air-tool die grinding and powered angle grinder work. It seems to have similar active ingredients to comparable products from PERMATEX, LOCTITE and KLEEN-STRIP, and also to the naval product VACTAN. My overall results have been consistent, and this is excellent for surface prep prior to priming or spray painting."
2,too big for shirt pocket,I found the case well made however it made the M100 too big to fit in my shirt pocket.
1,Didn't Work,"Bought for 12 hour plane ride, and voila, it didn't work. Don't know if there is a bad fuse or wire in it but thanks for wasting my money. (yes I used it properly) I'm happy to retract this if the company sends me my money back or a new one that actually works! I doubt they will dupe many more customers with 3 terrible reviews. Well 2, the person who said you can use a cigarette lighter is a moron and doesn't know what they are talking about. I fly >140,000 miles a year. Trust me, most use empower."
3,Fun record,"The novelty song ""The Curly Shuffle"" (Mets fans will recall) is what attracted me to this recording. That, and ""The Chicken Song"" are just plain fun. The rest of the album is well crafted, if not great, jump, blues and swing, including some nice horn arrangements. The cover of Willie Nelson's ""Night Life"" stands out as a solid interpretation, especially the sax solo.Not a Grammy winner, but it will make you smile."
5,Hall & Oates Collection,"My CD carrier got stolen recently with all my very favorite CDs, inclding this 2-CD set by Hall & Oates. I could hardly wait until they were replaced. We were real happy with this purchase. You came through so quickly and efficiently, I hardly missed a beat. Thanks for the chance to give our input."
1,One sided snoozefest.,"I found this book to be extremely boring, especially coming from a guy that produced the best western the modern world has seen. This book is a collection of accounts of some of the worst massacres in American history. I felt as if each page was dragging on and on leading me nowhere.The accounts are extremely one sided; the people who massacred are animals, those that perished are innocent people mowed down. I'm not trying to take anything away from history, there have been some awful things done in the name of expansion for the US, but this book is a little heavy in anti-American rhetoric.I applaud Mr. McMurty for trying his hand in non-fiction. Most writers never try anything other than their standard format, but he did. Unfortunately he failed."
1,"OK as PDA maybe, no good as an eBook","Everything you read in the other reviews is correct. The product is buggy and does not work anywhere near as advertised. PDA users seem satisfied with it, but I bought it as an eBook -- BIG MISTAKE. Even if they had decent software to load your text into Franklin format (their ""tools"" run under a Unix emulator on Windows, badly) and even if it read HTML files (you can download it quick enough, but you'll wait TWENTY MINUTES after you click the button to see the text), the screen is too small and battery life too short. Just say no. This is not an eBook."
3,not happy with franklin electronics,I purchased the ebookman 901 and i do enjoy the product but i bought the product with a...rebate from franklin that they offered and after 6 months and 3 inquiries to franklin i have still not received my rebate or even an answer from them so while my amazon.com experience was very good i do not recomend trying to deal with franklin electronics.
1,VERY disappointed,"I ordered the eBookman because I liked the fact that it would allow me to organize my day and read books. What I found was that the organizer applications are adequate, but VERY, VERY slow. As far as the book reading applications, it is indeed a ""one book at a time"" eBookman. I downloaded a couple of books from Franklin's free library and found that I could not open either one of them as long as both of them were loaded on the eBookman. I had to delete one to open the other. Given all the other flaws and inadequacies that have been mentioned in previous reviews, it's clear that this product is definitely not ""ready for prime time."" I ultimately decided not to keep Franklin's ""experimental"" eBookman product and I would caution others to read the reviews carefully and understand the severe limitations of this product before deciding to purchase."
1,crep for [the amount],"I bought this from here in december and got last friday.I spent my whole weekend and monday and tuesday trying to install the operating system without any luck. Tried to call technical dept. and the answer is ""you may want to try 5 more times to install it as there are some problems lots of people are noticing,you are doing right steps to install"".Battery compartment is worst,springs are at the positive end of battery and it never recovers for 30 min. after you remove the batteries to reboot it. Donot waste your money,buy handspring visor deluxe for ...(a little) more."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"Wow, I thought I was getting a deal buying this e-book reader with basic PIM function (which is enough for me) at this low price instead of paying Palm prices. I didn't even read the note of this Bonus Pack that came with it and was really surprised when I unpacked the device and saw a pack of extra styli, a USB laptop connector, ear phones and carry pouch, car lighter adapter, an audio car cassette kit, an AC power adapter with Europe connectors and a Cradle!!! What a value!! I feel guilty now for paying so little."
1,and my 2 irrelevant cents,"actualy I do not own a Franklin e-book, but once I bought a Franklin multi-language dictionary (translator) with some 12 languages. Honestly, my impression was that this dictionary has more languages than words: it did not not contain many of very common and basic words, and when I called the service to inqure about returng the product, they refused and advised me sort of to shove it up (I wonder whether this word is in their vocabulary)...Now, if this e-book is as good as their e-dictionary then what would you say?"
3,Wish they had a full-length...,"If you're a fan of the Dillinger Escape Plan, particularly their newer material (or the EP with Mike Patton), you may want to check this out. It features the current vocalist, along with a bunch of other noteworthy people.Too bad they never got around to recording a full-length album..."
5,one of the best,"its such a small cd.. 5 songs.but dont let that stop you from buying itits hard to finda cd these days that EVERY song on it is goodand yeah, the actualy disc is really cool looking....youll see it after you buy it. :-)"
5,"morose and bleak, but wonderful","initially, very stange, but after further review, this is one of my all time favorite collections of music."
3,good and solid,"Quite all right this one. Sparklehorse got good grades in the swedishg media when it came out, and why just this band and not all the other I reav about on my page got good grades is a mystery. But that's the way it is and here we are. It's distorted, angry, poppy, melodic, GUITARS, more edge, and powerful chords. All in a cool shape. It's anot an album I recommend if you just have money for one album this year, but listen to it. Second out ""Saint Mary"" is very good, and the CD is a grower"
3,ehhh...,"What to say? The album starts off good with roaring song ""Pig"", then it slows down with almost no hooks in it until ""Sick of Goodbyes"" which is another good song. All in all this album has 5 good songs, ""Pig"", ""Sick of Goodbye"", ""Little Elbows"", ""Hey Joe"", and ""Ghost of His Smile""."
4,"Great Coverage, I would buy it again!","I was hesitant at first to buy this product because I'm prone to break outs when I use anything that has any liquid makeup in it,which tends to clog my pores. But I bought it and crossed my fingers. And needless to say its perfect! No breakouts, great coverage, and it shipped fast as well. I gave it 4 stars because the color was a bit light for me, so I definitely need to choose a darker color next time. But other then that, it has become apart of my makeup routine and is a great product."
1,too expensive,"I ordered a set because the shipping was supposed to be $6.04, they charged my card with twice the shipping it was supposed to be so I was paying over $20. I had to cancel my order."
1,"Yeah, what was THIS supposed to be?","'The Egypt Game' is one of the best books I've ever read. So naturally, I was anxious to see what was next for the kids. If anyone knows their pop music history, this is like 'Bad' following 'Thriller'. It just isn't in the same class as its predecessor. It took the author about 30 years to release this ""book"", and the time span is painfully obvious. It's like looking at different people. And this whole deal with Toby running away? And when do they ever play the game? My edition of 'The Egypt Game' gives two sample chapters from the Gypsy game, and it looked good to me. I was sorely disappointed. This book places with 'Gigli', 'Star Wars Attack of the Clones', and 'Bad' as one of the most pointless pieces of garbage on the face of this Earth!!! But judge for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,An all right book,"Oooookaaay, the book wasn't that bad, it could have been a little worse, if I had to reccomend a book, this one probably wouldn't be on my top ten...so what I'm trying to say is:So it wasn't her best, big deal!...The Gypsy Game wasn't all about a game, maybe that's because the characters had other things to do besides play a game.Still, I would have liked a little bit of history and strange unexpecteds that you get in the Egypt Game."
2,A fair book which is technically lacking,"Dietz writes a fairly interesting story, but his command of scientific and technical issues is sorely lacking. He shows an inability to extrapolate technological advances into improvements in weaponry. If you wish to see well done speculations on future weaponry, read any of David Drake's military sci fi. Also his characters are none too deep, and the villains are simply two dimensional. However the action is good, and the plot is fairly interesting. Not a bad read, but nothing special."
2,"Extremely Expensive, Extremely Thin","This book is nice, but too expensive and too thin...It doesn't go into great detail, it is very brief.A quarter of its price would be still a bit expensive.The pages makeup is a bit flat."
4,Another side of Minneapolis,"As a former Minnesotan, I was interested in this generally untold side of Minnesota history. I have lived in Minneapolis and loved it, but was shaken by these horrors that long preceeded my time there. I would have appreciated more specific addresses and names of businesses where events took place as it would have put the story in a more real context, but only for those familiar with the city. It is almost unbelievable to imagine the kind of opposition that existed to those publishing information which went contrary to the public image desired by those in power-both ""legitimate"" and underworld people. I'm glad Ms. Woodbury used her research skills to write this work. It does indeed exonerate her family, and her respect for her parents is well deserved, especially her telling of her mother's grace and dignity in coping with this tragedy."
3,"Hermione, The Magical Untalking Doll","My doll didn't even talk when I got her. At first, I thought it was because the batteries were dead. Replaced the batteries...nothing. I think this doll has a design problem. Had I paid more for her, I would have been upset.It is a shame, because the doll is cute in itself. The clothes are really nicely made--better than usual. They aren't easy to remove, though. This doll also isn't jointed, so it rather stiff. You can't pose her as well as you can some of the other Hermione dolls."
3,Nice but bulky,"I'll be the party pooper here and say that I am a little disappointed with the m100 Palmglove. On the plus side it looks great, feels great and will protect your beloved Palm from practically anything short of a direct nuclear strike. Unfortunately I do find that it adds a considerable bulk to the m100. Without the glove the m100 slips nicely into my breast pocket or trousers pocket, but when it is gloved it becomes very cumbersome and awkward whichever pocket I put it in.Regarding the flip cover & the glove relationship I find that the glove somehow causes the flip cover to detach from the Palm all by itself numerous times a day, this became intolerable after a while. So, whenever I use the glove I would take the flip cover off. Nowadays I only use the glove when I carry the Palm in my briefcase. If I venture outdoors without any hand baggage I tend to just take the Palm and leave the glove at home."
5,Emergence - a story with a different perspective,"""Emergence"" is a thriller and a page turner with a very different twist. It is thought provoking and provides the reader with ideas that could lead to very different conclusions about the theories it stimulates throughout the narrative. It definitely went down some ""roads less traveled"" based on my own real life experiences. If you want to read a book that will energize your thought processes, then pick this story up and start reading. It will be very difficult for you to put it back on the shelf once you start it. Fast paced and definitely worth the read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to broaden their perspectives on our planet and how it started and where it is going in the future."
2,Too difficult,"Although I've studied chemistry for almost 5 years, this book was really complicated and too difficult for me"
1,Difficult Book to Learn from,"I think this is a very disappointing book because the book tries to talk way over your head. I have three semesters of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra under my belt, and I sometimes had problem following some of his derivations. However, for the most part the math was not the problem, the problem was trying to make sense of the concepts. As stated before their is the sense the author is intentially trying to talk over your head. If anyone has read this book they know what I mean. Fortunally, I had a back up P-chem book that did a far job than Alberty/Silbey. I do not recomend this book, and if you have to use this book because your instructor says so, I recomend that you look into a second, backup source. Good Luck."
2,"looking for a decent, friendly physical chemistry book?","Please see my review of Physical Chemistry by K.J. Laidler, J.H. Meiser, B.C. Sanctuary (ISBN 0618123415) for detailed comments on that book plus other useful p-chem books. Link:Physical ChemistrySee my other reviews for other chem books."
3,Much like I thought it would be.,"No ground breaking here, just some enlightenment. The best part of the book deals with the kind of leadership we have and the leadership we are sorely missing."
1,Idiot-Liar,"Hunt is so busy getting his name in the media he disregards facts and slanders his betters.This Hunt guy should shut up and fade away for slandering the Haditha Marines in this twaddle of a ""book"" Hunt thinks anyone cares about save himself."
1,BUILD IT AND WATCH IT FALL OVER !!!!!!!!!,BUILT THIS WITH MY SON.TOY FALLS OVER WHEN HEAVY MACHANICAL PIECE IS SET ON TOP OF UNSTABLE BASE CAUSING MAJOR DESTRUCTION AND DESTROYING HOURS OF WORK. BAD DESIGN.ALSO WAS MISSING PIECES NEEDED TO FINISH.
1,Really disappointed at the recording quality.,Reading some of the reviews i thought & expected the audio quality too be very good.Instead i was disappointed .Overall the audio fidelity is mediocre .Whats more this is an expensive product. The so called rare stereo versions are very disappointing.
4,Morbid Bathroom Fodder,"A most entertaining read! Not only does it list the often quite entertaining final meals of many death row inmates (inspired of course by the Texas Department of Justice which used to list the final meals on its execution page before sadly taking them down a couple of years ago), but it also provides many fun facts about executions. The book is filled with short little snippets which makes it the perfect bathroom reader. I highly recommend putting one in yours today!"
3,BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,"Though I ordered a few items including this for Christmas, I was disappointed in a way that this item did not arrive. The shipment date originally given to me did not meet up with expectations. If this was not going to be delivered by Christmas, I should have given the options to pay shipping within 3 to 5 days. Was not too happy that the gift did not arrive in time for Christmas. That was my only disappointment. As for the product, it arrived after Christmas in one piece. So that kind of made up for the late after-Christmas gift."
2,Not so useful,I like the m100 because of its size. This case makes the thing huge! Not much use for me. Also the plastic that is used to hold it in is a bit tight for the m100.
4,Great performance...if you only plan to use it for a year,"I bought this recorder, after reading reviews, researching the product for my need (college lectures)and purchased it via Amazon. I like the voice recorder...it is small, easy to use (although I carried the product information pamplet in my bookbag, just in case), nice playback sound (although if using earphones, you can only hear from one side). Sounds like a great product??? Well, after a year of use, it simply stopped working. Thats it. I thought I was recording lectures, afterall the red light came on each time, and it wasn't working. To my disappointment, it cannot be repaired. So...about $60 for a years use, I won't be purchasing another from Olympus."
2,Great Recorder died,"I bought this a couple of years ago and used it once. So, while practicing for a concert with our choir I started recording the practice sessions. I only recorded 4 or 5 sessions and then it died during last practice. I thought it was the battery, although it showed 50% charged when I arrived, but, I changed the batteries out and it still would do nothing. So, now I have no recordings and no way to access the previous ones.I wish it would playback, like some of the other reviewers.I don't know if I will buy a newer one or switch brands"
4,Excellent tribute,"Satyricon's version of ""Kathaarian Life Code"" is a stellar piece of work, basically its an updated version of the original song. Very well done. Enslaved's rendition of ""Natassja in Eternal Sleep"" is absolutely stunning, perfectly matches the original. Thorns completely butchered ""The Pagan Winter"" with their awful techno-robot sounds and vocals. Emperor's version of ""Cromlech"" is killer, enough said. Dodheimsgard brutalized ""Green Cave Float"", a bad song in the first place, by adding a pointless piano solo at the end among other things. Gehenna's version of ""Transilvanian Hunger"" is absolutely smashing, very in your face and heavy. Gorgoroth's version of ""Slottet I Det Fjerne"" is terrible in every aspect. And as for Immortal's version of ""To Walk the Infernal Fields,"" I definitely expected better. The vocals lack the intensity that Nocturno Culto has, and the instruments are too soft."
2,Please read before purchase,"I bought this gun expecting it to shoot around 465fps, instead it shoots about 330 fps or so. no matter how you adjust it, the bb just goes straight down after about 300 feet, so I wouldn't recommend it for long range sniping. It might be slightly overpriced. Other than that, it's a fine piece."
1,DO NOT BUY,"As many of you may know Sydney Omarr's passed away. The books written until 2005 were all written before his death. As of 2006, someone else is writing these books (not Sydney Omarr). The quality and accuracy Sydney Omarr had, is no longer there.Don't waste a penny on this book"
5,Great aerobic workout that is almost an hour long,"I love this tape! I have purchased it 3 times because I wear it out! I wish it was on DVD. This is a fun tape, easy to follow, with a warm up, cool down and over 40 minutes of dance routines set to great Broadway tunes. Some of the Simmons tapes are hard to follow, but this one presents patterns that are easy to pick up and perfect with practice. It is one I like to do every day. You really see results from using it, too."
4,Pretty well documented,"This book, though not THE Bible for a Yes fan, is a good reference particularly for the novice who wants to know more about the pre-history of a band who helped create prog rock in the early 70s.The reader will find it widely illustrated with tour photos, posters and pics taken from several LP booklets.It has a huge amount of info on different albums, LPs, singles and CD releases.A nice book for the price."
3,It's well worth reading carefully despite of an half book...,"Well I have to read more carefully and I think anyway of a good start to begin analysing the best and most prolific period in the Yes history..But I have to remark that about an half section of the Book (The appendix) is full with references,Tour dates, bootlegs and so on, which I evaluate a little bit interesting and usefull!! Some photos are ok, but others are a bit glossy...Well the music of Yes it's better than many further words, but if you don't know this living legend of progressive rock, it could be a good place to start and begin to know something about their golden era."
4,"It's Good, but Just not the Same!","I loved the first game, it was challenging and foced you to use all of your people. This new Desperados isn't as good as the Original though it looks alot nicer. In Desperados 2 I find it possible to almost finish levels with just one person. Don't get me wrong, this game is good... but just doesn't feel as hard or challenging as the first Desperados. This game will probably not disapoint you!"
1,Terrible,"I bought this game with high hopes, but was greatly disappointed. The main problem with this game is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a first person shooter, or an overhead tactical game like the first Desperados. Sadly, it fails in both categories. The tactical game's controls are difficult to master (case in point: I was unable to find a zoom button, so objects were hard to see) and for certain actions, the game forces you to switch to 3rd person. 3rd person makes actions easier, but I personally prefer the overhead view. I was hoping this game would be like the first, but they strayed so far from the formula that it ruined it for me. If you're like me and wanted more of what the first Desperados was like, 100% tactical overhead, try Robin Hood: The Legend Of Sherwood (in my opinion a 5 star game) and leave this one alone."
5,Superb Information!,"As an educator for 30 years, both in teaching and administrative roles, Jim Fay's Love and Logic approach to classroom management is powerful and immediately practical! The techniques are ""ready made"" and can be implemented in the classroom immediately. Whether you are a ""rookie"" or a teacher with many years in the profession...you'll find that Love and Logic can be adapted to any teaching style. Another point to be made is that you don't have to ""do it all""...just pick and choose the techniques and have some fun ""experimenting"". I think you'll find that you'll be having extra energy at the end of the day for your family and YOURSELF!"
5,Excellent resource,"I read Teaching With Love and Logic over the summer, and found it quite pertinent and applicable to today's classroom. I am only a beginning teacher, and I have yet to apply the techniques found in this book, but it was a pleasurable and insightful read. If I were to find any fault in the book it is that it may be a tad repetitive at times, covering and recovering the same topics in slightly different ways."
4,I like this case!,"I am really pleased with this case (I purchased one for $.01). The only problem (which is not that big of a deal) is that the stylus is harder to get to. Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape. However, don't expect to be able to use the cradle without taking the PDA out."
2,Buyer Beware,"I am a very advance crocheter, who has his own business. I write my own patterns, and I am aware of has to be done to get one together.This book is so poorly written. Every piece I have tried from it has gone horribly wrong. I have had to write, re-write, recalculate. The gauge (hook vs yarn) is so off... you will spend more time doing a gauge swatch than working on your project. I agree with other reviews- if there was a pattern tester, they did a horrible job.This book is just not worth the price."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to find this book. The designs are gorgeous. The patterns, however, are useless. While I consider myself an advanced crochter, I have had to repeatedly re-do and modify all of the half dozen projects I've completed from this book. I am convinced that there was not a pattern tester involved in the publication of this book. At best, this book is useful for inspiration. At worst, it is frustrating to put a lot of work into something and not have it come out right. I would like to see this author and publisher clean these patterns up and issue a second edition. Until then, I wouldn't bother."
2,Gorgeous items poor instructions,"I love every piece in this book they all look gorgeous BUT the instructions for the patterns are very poor. Vague at best and I found myself trying to figure out how to finish items on my own. It was dissapointing since the pieces are so great looking. Most of the patterns are labled intermediate but I'm not too sure about that, if the instructions were worded better this book would be my favorite."
3,Duke Book,It arrived right on time! A tad dissipointed because the brand new book has a small tear but nothing major.
3,Good but not great,"My first introduction to David Gemmell and to Druss. Entertaining and an easy read but a bit too unbelievable.I like historical novels and was hoping this might be along those lines even if not based on fact.It was not, but was a great warfare epic with romance and drama thrown in for good measure."
5,Very Underrated,"David is one of the most underrated authors in my mind. Over the years I have re-read this book over 3 times and each time I enjoy it more and more.When he died, it was a major loss to the fantasy community."
3,Not his best...,"Interesting read. Colorful. I found the characters a wee bit unbelievable - personality wise. BUT, a good read for a rainy day, or when you are snowed in!"
2,Pricing for Kindle,This is a great book but it is ridiculous that the price of the kindle version is more than 50% more expensive than the physical paperback.
1,did not get what I ordered,I ordered this 100 pack and only recieved a 50 pack of DVD -rwould not order from this person again.
2,Unreadable on an HP Computer!?,"I bought these disks expecting them to be an upgrade from the generic (GQ, Great Quality) discs that I normally buy on sale. Although they appear to work fine on my iMac, they are unrecognizable to a friend's HP PC. Odd.The other irksome issue is that there is not enough room on the disk for writing a neat contents list. The pointless screened graphics take up to mush of the area of the disk.Other than those issues, the disks are fine."
4,This Is A Good Accessory If You Use Eudora,"This little modem runs on two AAA batteries! It's actually somewhat awesome to hear it chirp when making a connection. The software, MultiMail is OK but does not support file attachments to email. A better free Internet software suite is Eudora for the Palm. Eudora also supports Web browsing. You can hotsync your Eudora email for the Palm with the Eudora email for the PC.The modem is only 3300 baud but that is adequate for email and occasional Web browsing. Over all, a pretty good value."
3,These do not work with the m125,I bought some of these when I ordered a Palm m125. Once I got my order I found that they are different than the m125 stylus.
3,They don't fit well in the m125 holder,"These styluses fit into the storage hole on the m125, but they stick out because of the length of the stylus top. I checked out the styluses for the m500 series and they look like they will have the same problem. A stylus that fits flush like the original stylus would be nicer. I took a saw to the ones I bought to keep them from sticking out.Otherwise they work great and the sale price was a good deal."
2,Doesn't fit m105,"Well, they fit, but they don't click in like the originals did so they are loose in the holder. Looking at them I can't see the difference but these just don't lock in."
4,Great book: parents can become great selfmade therapists!,"Great book. Enjoyed reading it. As a pastlifetherapist (children/adults)myself I love to read that parents can be of a tremendous help to their own children to solve problems connecting pastlifetrauma's. Therapists are not allways needed, parents can do great by themselves (with the help of the book). Kind regards, Marianne Notschaele, pastlifetherapist, Holland"
2,Childrens Past Lives,The print was exceptionally small..difficult to read. The subject matter was poorly presented being very wordy darting around the subject matter. Not nearly as good as Soul Survivor.
3,"Bobby Kennedy fan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin","The assassination of Robert Kennedy added significantly to his already growing legacy. His involvement with the poor, african americans, and native americans was extraordinary to say the least. If you're expecting this book to detail Kennedy's political philosophy, then don't even bother. This book can be descrbed as being a large tabloid. Even so, that doesn't make this book bad either. For us die hard Bobby Kennedy admirers, it tarnishes the image that we have of him in a sense. Meaning, sometimes we forget he was human just like us. I would recommend this book if you are interested in a behind the scenes look of RFK, but beware, i feel a good share of the info is heresay and circumstantial. Don't let that tarnish your opinion of this great historical figure who wanted to change the world for the better."
2,A Step Above a Tabloid,"I bought this book thinking I was adding to my library of Robert Kennedy materials. Instead of being a serious critique or serious historical analysis of his political career, it was little more than a tabloidesque telling of his alleged adulterous affairs. When a person is elected into public office, that person is, in effect, being hired to do a job. That person's private life is not being hired. I see no real purpose in disclosing these alleged affairs and see nothing useful or constructive in this. If the author's purpose was to discredit the work of Robert Kennedy or trivialize him personally, he did not succeed. I have always believed Robert Kennedy was a man of strong character, a hard worker, sincere in his efforts and committed to his visions. I was really hoping for a serious portrayal of the man who would be president. Instead, I get what can most gently be described as ""adult entertainment for those at the tabloid level."" It really was a big disappointment."
5,Jetta Bra! (Very Good!),"Konstigt att produktbeskrivningen inte lista Angela Kovacs, stjärnan i showen! Sorry, back into English mode... I simply want to 'ditto' the reviews here. I really like Angela Kovacs' Det. Huss. She is a smart detective and a pretty good mom to boot. Not being familier with the series (only one book), I decided to order only the first three episodes. Now that I have watched them, the rest of the Irene Huss series has quickly been added to my wish list. Let me also say that it's great so much of the excellent Swedish TV series and films are making it into region 1, FINALLY, with English subtitles vice dubbed, and at reasonable price!'"
4,Loved it ...but....,"I ordered this after a couple of good revs and also a pal picked this up!!Loved it very muc ,except for 1 issue, it clearly says White MArble ,on the box and to prove this the pic here and on the box is white marble too!!but the pin i recvd in more of a grey streaked marble!!Now i know what EXACTLY ,i am talking about when i say white marble, its purely white ,and a few grey streaks would be ok but the the one i recvd is fully grey!!I know there is a big difference even in price when u do buy white and grey streaked marble!!this is totally unfair and specially after i paid almost the cost of product for shipping!!Am so hoping the company will look into this and i sure am gng to put a request for exchange coz if its white marble that i order i should get white marble!!and am sure amazon will do the needfull!!"
5,Beautiful book that will lift a child's self-esteem,"Everyone deserves to feel that they are valued...that we each have a place in this world. Who doesn't want to feel wanted, loved, and appreciated? It's especially important for children to feel that they are loved and special. Children who aren't given these positive affirmations tend to have low self-esteem and a poor self-image.The new book, ""I AM a Lovable ME! by Sharon Penchina C.Ht. and Dr. Stuart Hoffman, aims to empower children with positive suggestions and the knowledge that they are loved and important. If children live with these positive reinforcements, they are more apt to grow up with high self-esteem and self-worth. Isn't this what we want for our children?MyParenTime.com highly recommends this book -- it expresses to children that they are loved, special, and worth something! The illustrations are beautiful and bright, and the text placement is fun! Children are sure to enjoy listening to and/or reading this delightful book :)."
1,NOT A REAL SPECIAL FORCES SHIRT,"Do not waste your money on this. It is not a real special forces shirt! That is not the patch of special forces, and has never been. ""recon"" tab is clearly poorly made, and never existed as an actual tab."
1,"Crap, just crap.","This is honestly the worst radio ever. The day I opened it I instantly noticed a horrible smell coming from the unit itself. It really smells like ass.It only has a rechargeable battery. They say it lasts for four or more hours, but that is a lie. I received it on Friday. I plugged it into the wall from Friday, all day Saturday, and all day Sunday. I wanted to listen to a show on Monday. Today (October 24, 2005), I unplugged it and turned it on. It lasted for a totally of an hour and a half. THAT'S IT!!!!!!!Not only that, but the reception is horrible. The flashlight is small and weak. It is way over priced. I know radios for ten dollars that are way better then this. Do not buy this crap. If you need a radio buy anything, but this.If I could give it 0 stars I would."
2,A decent reference manual,"If you are looking for an exhaustive, narrow focused list of procedures on how to manage a project, you have it here. It was disappointing for me because I could have learned the same tactics by finding some procedure list on the internet. It feels like the author just starting spewing out his list of procedures, and kept doing that the whole way.In case you are familiar with newer agile principles, don't look for any sympathy in this book. It's filled with everything you already know about the ""old-school"". There was a small part of me that wanted to be inspired by more traditional methods. But the methods presented left me feeling that the author just used them without question, which is a fine way to stay in a profession rut.Incredibly boring to read. Not a ""classic"". It could pass as a reference manual though. Not recommended."
1,Ego trip...,"Wow... what a great read... that is, it's a great read if you want to read the same sentiment over and over: Ed Sullivan is a very smart guy, and all the people at NuMega (now Compuware corp.) are geniuses. If you take a look at their current product offerings you might decide that Ed's ""philosphy"" _might_ not be the best way to go.Just read the sample pages included here at amazon before you decide to plunk down your money on this obvious ego trip."
3,"smells toxic and not as glittery as I hoped, but it's fun","The worst part is the smell. It's worse than hair spray in terms of smelling like alcohal. Yuck! It smells toxic.As for the glitter part, I bought silver and was disappointed with the amount of sparkle. The glitter is very fine and goes straight to the scalp. I barely see any on the hair. I can see it in her scalp, though. My daughter at 4 loves it. I think if she had black hair perhaps it would show up more. I feel as if I have to spray too much to notice it."
3,prompt delivery but cap was cracked upon opening,"I just received the BWILD ""glitter gold and silver spray."" I opened the ""bubbler mailer"" and found the cap cracked. It doesn't close properly. I'm afraid if i take it anywhere in my bag, it might leak. I would appreciate the seller to have more common sense and send the product in a box or more padding because this isn't acceptable, especially when you pay $8 for something. Hopefully if i order more, this problem will be solved.Itemed arrived quickly but not satisfied with the outcome.Also, why does the spray have a very strong perfumey smell, as other reviewers have stated? Is there a way to fix that??thank you!"
2,Over Produced...,"...and over-rated tripe.And, with the exception of ""Fisherman's Blues"" (a great tune, mind you) and ""The Whole Of the Moon,"" a trite and trivial 80's bookmark. Maybe.I'd've been better off spending my money on a couple or three pints of Guinness."
3,"Short life of initial charges, may get better over time.","So I got this thinking it was a good deal, but when I got it home and started using it, the first few charges were weak-sauce. It would only take about 4 pics using a flash per charge. I know the batteries need conditioned first, but that seemed a little low to me. The batteries seem to be performing better now, but I haven't done any testing to see by how much.The charger is great, though. It senses when the batteries are charged and turns off, it has a built-in fan to keep the batteries cool. It is well-designed and functional."
5,Works Great!,"I love this charger and use mine all the time! To switch from AA to AAA you just turn a little switch on the side. The Duracell batteries it comes with are excellent! I use my batteries in my digital camera and they last a long time! I've been using them for over a year now with no problems at all and I take a lot of pictures! It charges extremely fast, probably the fastest charger I've come accross. This product is diffenetly worth the money and has payed for itself a hundred times over in the money it has saved me on batteries."
3,info quality(insuficient ifo),"when i bught my duracell cef90nc charger, the package did not show any specific information about battery suported. it wasn't until after i openned the the clamshell it comes in, that the specific info was revealed. i said "" charge duracell nimh rechargeable only"" or it may blowup. but when i bught this thing at the store, i could not see this info and i also bought a pack of energizer nimh. will they blow up if i use them on my duracell charger? who knows? is this battery terrorism? is this a marketing scam to force us buy duracel only nimh batteries? ifi believe it, i'll have to waste time going back to the store for an exchange. if i don't believe it, i might get injured. this totally really vacuums."
5,Always Charged,This is a very good product. The batteries seem to be fully charged and last a lot longer than regular batteries plus I have a spare set always charged. I use them for my digital camera. The fan on the charger is quiet but I recommend that while it is plugged in and charging that the unit be placed on a hard surface to facilitate good air flow.
4,Proper aspect ratio from Hammer for a change,"While most hammer films are hacked off on the top and bottom of a 4x3 for a fake 16x9 widescreen version on dvd releases, At least ""2 faces of Dr. Jekyl"" I know is not. I had a full screen version that had the ""sides cut"" so this dvd release is actualy ""real widescreen"". Nice quality on the films too. Too bad they don't do more like this."
4,nice welder machine,very nice welder machine I agreed with this new machine I happy the welder its work perfect all the steel materialthanks
4,entertaining,If you aren't familiar with Groucho Marx you will not get the subtleties of this novel. It was a quick satisfying read. I enjoyed it.
1,ripoff,"This item seemed overpriced for an early edition anyway, and on top of that, the book purchased did not arrive in any manner similar to that which it was advertised. Shipping took forever, and pages are missing."
2,Nice boat but breaks easily,"My kids were so excited to get this boat. The first time we took it out in a small pond the batteries died and thank goodness a kid was nice enough to wade into the water to take out the boat. Then we bought the rechargeable battery which is better, but the plastic pieces which make the boat go fell off, so it didnt move that fast. If you buy this boat, its good for 2-3 times of use thats it, unless you keep replacing the plastic pieces."
3,Telegraph Days,"I found it a curious book, but hardly the great western novel. The central character, Nellie Courtright, did not seem to me to be too authentic. She seemed much too modern for her time. The book wanted to be epic in sweep, but came across as almost cartoonish at times. It tried to cover too much in to short a time. While I didn't dislike the book, I had expected more from it and from Larry McMurtry."
4,Muy educativo,"El video es muy educativo con respecto a las técnicas de relajación, y las técnicas realmente resultaron efectivas para mi esposa. A ella le sirvieron para mantener el control y reducir el dolor del trabajo de parto.A mi me sirvió mucho la parte de la filmación del parto para estar preparado psicológicamente para acompañar a mi esposa dentro de la sala de partos.Sin embargo, encontré algunos defectos como:- Es muy rápido, hay que pausar y retroceder miles de veces para poder entender y practicar los ejercicios.- La traducción al español tiene bastantes errores, y muchas veces pronuncian muy mal.- La filmación es bastante antigua, por lo que hay cosas que ya han cambiado en la actualidad (por ejemplo la anestesia epidural, que allí aparece bastante más difícil y delicada de lo que es ahora, o los peinados de las personas)"
3,Dewalt 16 guage nail gun,"Easy to load and use, however suffers from jamming, trying to shoot two nails at same time. Happens about one out of thirty times. Fairly easy to clear when it happens."
3,Worth reading....,"Elizabeth Larocca's husband is dead and now his killers are after her and their adult daughter, Cara. Stephen had kept secrets throughout their marriage- secrets that ultimately killed him. Elizabeth doesn't know who to trust- her husband's old friend, James, who lied about killing someone at the airport or Ian, the seemingly innocuous college professor who claims Stephen asked him to protect her. NO SAFE PLACE has a complex, sometimes muddled plot in which the enemy's face is a complete mystery until the very end."
5,Very nice,This is a well balanced axe which makes using it so much easier. It's well-made and there is a nice edge on the axe. Perfect for hiking or around the house.
4,If you break this ?,If you manage to break this then you were definitely looking for a different axe to start with this axe is tough tough tough my only small complaint is it's probably a few ounces heavier than a backpacking axe should be on the other hand the extra few ounces gives it the weight to do the actual work you want it to with out hacking at a piece of wood forever so I'm okay with it all in all Gerber knows what their doing
5,If you love the 80's,"This is not only a great movie if you like Boy George but, it's also a great movie if you love the 80's. If you are interested in the 80's club scene or a fan of Steve Strange of Visage, this movie has it all. This movie is a blast, a blast from the past!"
1,VERY Disappointed,I am a HUGE fan of Truefitt and Hill and expected this to be yet another addition to my repertoire....I was wrong. I can't comment on the quality of the moisturizer because the smell was so badI had ot take it off at once. I though tI had purchased a bad one so bought another form another source but same thing....$50 right into the garbage.
5,For my hamster only,Looks smaller in the picture. Much better in person.My hamster loves it. She goes crazy on the wheel. Easy to install.
3,Dissapointed,"Our two gerbils ate the original wheel. Got this to replace it plus expand for fun. The potty and wheel broke off after a few cleanings. Very fragile to deal with. Frustrating. While it works, it's great to watch the gerbils enjoy, and the wheel is super quiet. Still have the tubes. At least they set you up with bubble ends to cap off broken attachments. I contacted the co. to see if they might replace the wheel...got absolutely no response."
2,really poor quality,"i bought this for my gerbils and they were able to chew off a nice amount of it, which can be a problem if you dont want them escaping! the outhouse part was especially junky,cracked before i had a chance to use it. also, you will need to buy better connector rings to keep all the pieces together. one thing my gerbils and i do love though is the wheel! no complaints there."
5,Witty and humorous for children and adults alike,"At the wedding preparations for the Prince and his beautiful Russian bride , a conceited rocket boasts of his great worth to all the other fireworks being prepared for a magnificent display.Written with fantastic wit, and full of eloquent humorous quotes, this charming classic can be appreciated by children and adults alike."
1,"What Happened To ""Truth In Advertising?""","Advertised 360 1000 mg capsules of buffered (Vitamin) C. What I actually received was 360 capsules of 500 mg ea, which is 50% less than promised. I take a lot of supplements, including ONE 1000 mg cap of Vitamin C daily. I don't want/need to take TWO capsules to fill that requirement. I have reported the issue, but am discouraged to see that nothing has been done to change the description, which qualifies as a Bait and Switch scenario."
1,Way Too Much,"We got this book out at the library yesterday and I will be returning it and reporting it to the librarian. This is WAY too graphic for a child to read. I normally do not preview the books that we check out of the children's library before my children read them. When my 7 year-old said ""what does s-p-e-r-m spell"", I immediately took the book from her. She is not ready for that kind of information. This book should have a warning on the front of it that states there is explicit content inside. No parent should ever have to explain something to their child before that child is ready for it."
4,"Very well done, maybe too much detail for younger kids","My daughter is two, and we're expecting our second child. This book was a gift, and I have to say it is very well done. I've put it on the shelf for now, because it is too much detail for her. However, whenever it is that she wants to know how the sperm and the egg got together (even if baby number 2 is a toddler by that point!) this is the book I'll pull out. The sex details aren't the only ones that make this book over the head of most two year olds -- in general it just has a lot of information."
1,Unable to play on four different DVD players,"Having seen the program on PBS, I'm sure the content of this DVD is great - if only I could play it. It won't play on my computer DVD drive, nor on the DVD player hooked up to my TV, nor on TV DVD players of two other people I've tried. My big mistake was buying it in September as a Christmas gift and, wanting to leave the shrink wrap intact, not opening it in time to return it. Guess I'm out of luck now, but learned my lesson."
2,A let-down,Probably my own fault but I only discovered upon playing this DVD that it was only a 60-minute recording. A waste of the DVD format?The setting is just too 'twee' - an orchestra inside a manger/stable?This DVD was the only let-down we have experienced in all of the Andre Rieu recordings we have bought to date.
4,pretty good,"I use this pack for my bike riding. Holds my wallet, phone, spare water perfectly. Nice and light weight. Only been using for a few days so far so cant say how sturdy they are, so thats why I only gave it 4 stars"
4,Australian Brilliance,"All great Australian music talks about sunlight. This is no exception. The sun is always present in Born Sandy Devotional, from the heat it creates on the sidewalk, to the glare of the desert, to dusk occurring while half a world away it is dawn.This album has five unbelievable songs about Australian life. The Seabirds, Estuary Bed, Wide Open Road, The Chickenkiller, and Tender Is The Night (Long Fidelity); these five songs are bona fide classics that everyone should listen to all the time, to absorb their depth, to revel in their soul, and to enjoy their message. The other five songs on the album are not so great, but it's still worth the money for the five canonical numbers.The booklet that comes with this CD provides a lot of insight into the recording process."
3,Sugar-free Mints,"I would have to say the overall flavor of the product was nice, my only issue was that it disolved fairly quickly. I prefer things that last a bit longer. That being said, I would probibly purchase this product again."
1,Contains TOXIC ingredients,"Has toxic magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide which is carcinogen.This explains WHY the ingredients are not displayed and you need to BUY a product to see what's in it.TRY Ricochet Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint -- it's THE BEST!All natural and has only THREE ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Arabic, and Peppermint Essential Oil."
4,"Good Movie, - (Whitney Houston's finally acting job)","I would rate this movie okay, it was interesting and we enjoyed watching it. We'll add it to our collection and watch it again at some point in the near future."
2,Sparkle,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie theme and scenes just didn't flow or hold my attention
3,Some good performances but a bit cliched,"I wanted to see this chiefly for Whitney. Nobody wants to speak ill of her since her untimely death, but I have to say I still feel she was just NOT an actress. She spent most of the movie glaring sternly and doing that weird moving-her-head-side-to-side thing that's supposed to convey indignance, as in ""Who are YOU to say that to ME?"" She did a good job with her big gospel number, though that song was really not my cup of tea and her voice was nothing like what it used to be. Her best moment was smiling radiantly in the audience when Sparks was performing her big finale. (I don't mean that sarcastically -- she just looked very beautiful and happy at that moment.) The rest of the cast were excellent, ESPECIALLY Carmen Ejogo, who was just electrifying. Why isn't she a bigger star?The story and script, to me, were pretty corny and predictable, though the musical numbers were great. On the whole, though, I think ""Dreamgirls"" did all of this better."
4,Sparkle,Great movie! Jordin Sparks did a great job in this remake. Whitney Houston was beautiful as always as the sisters' mother.
4,A wonderful film,"The actors/actresses characters were well played and the movie was a great remake,however, it also seemed as it was just another great film. I cried when I saw Whitney of courseEspecially when she started to sing. Overall, it was a beautiful movie."
3,Sparkle,"It was okay, and I wish it won't have been Whitney Huston's last film. That is the only reason that I watched it, and it was just an average movie. It's worth seeing, but not a must."
4,WOW!,"NECK AND NECK WITH THE ORIGINAL, IN FACT I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS ONE BETTER, WHITNEY WAS AT HER BEST VOCALLY"
4,I loved the film. I,"Overall, I gave the film 4 stars. It would have been 5 if the character, Levi had closure w/Sister. The movie reminded me of my childhood. I was 6 yrs. of age in '68 and remember the sounds of Motown, the fashions of the time. Whitney did a phenomenal job and I recognized hers and Tamela Mann's characterizations of the women during that time. The Sisters reminded me of my mother and her two sisters. The store looked like many stores that my mom, her two sisters, and my grandmother frequented during that time. Contrary to some the critics, Jordin did a great job. She was the foil to everyone else. After all, Sparkle's struggle was finding the courage to stand in the spotlight on her own."
3,It was ok,"The movie was good in the beginning, but it started to fall apart in the ending. The way that Sparkle became a solo artist did not come together right. Kind of makes me question, why is it called ""Sparkle"". The movie showed her as a solo artist about 5 minutes, and then it ended :/"
3,Remakes rarely live up to the original,"The original, with Irene Cara and Lonette McKee and Philip Michael Thomas was less fluff and more gritty. Remakes are just what they say they are."
2,Sparkle,The story is not well developed. Whitney obviously just did it for the paycheck. I did enjoy the musical performances.
5,plate,great ondition arrive looking all shiny enjoyed sharing it with my kids it was purchased as a gift for them
1,The Bone Lady by Mary Manheim,"I must agree with the reviewer from Eindhoven, Netherlands, the buildup was great and I scoured the city for a copy, alas it left me wanting. Perhaps a closer scrutiny of the title would have been justified, ""the Bone Lady"" is about the bone lady, and much less about how she does what she does. I wuld recommend ""Dead Men do tell Tales"" fascinating and revealing."
3,Interesting--Needs More,"After hearing Mary Manhein speak I was very interested in her book. In the book she did record many cases, and gave a pretty good overview of the field. The best part of the book was her retelling what brought her to become a forensic anthropologist. I was disappointed at the lack of real detail and depth in talking about the cases and the politics of the field."
2,Bone Lady,"I found this a little dull. The stories are not emotionally compelling, perhaps because so many of them involve never identified, or already identified, remains. Maybe I'm heartless but it's hard to get caught up in the story of an anonymous tibia. In the tale the author says scared her, chilled her to the bone, she is alone in the lab and-- hears a noise behind her! That's not much of a story. There are several diagrams of bones and interesting, clear explanations of how male and female, young and old skeletons are differentiated."
2,Disappointing,"I thought that the pictures were good but that the content itself was a huge disppointment. Descriptions were lacking and none of her cases seem to be ""fleshed out""."
4,"Easy read, interesting",This book is divided into short chapters each of which are on a different case. I enjoyed being able to start and stop without losing the story line.
4,Reads like a story,"This book read very easily, just like someone was telling you a series of short stories. It was my first book on this subject, and although it was easy to read, I must say I didn't actually learn much. I now have a clear definition of what forensic anthropology is, but that's about all. It's a good book, just not very deep."
2,The War Continues,"Somewhat convoluted approach to the Southern cause, but now that I have finished the book, it is not worth reading. Perhaps it is worth checking out of the public library to grasp the ""Northern"" view point, but overall, the book is too partisan."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"This product was great until the gerbils ate the slide, which took 1 week! Now there is no was for them to get to the wheel. A replacement slide is around $13 (including shipping) from Crittertail. I don't know why they don't make the slide out of the same plastic as the tubes!! Do NOT throw your hard earned money away on this! My daughter was crushed after she saved her money to buy a product that lasted a week! I felt so sorry for her, I gave her the money back!"
2,a disappointment,"I looked forward to the larger size so I could cook in slightly larger pans. I can't even use the loaf pan I used in my smaller toaster oven. The heat is uneven and burns on the bottom so the shelf has to be in the high position. Even toast is darker on the bottom with the shelf in the middle position. Toast seems to take a long time and gets dried out. On a positive note, the crumb tray is a nice feature."
2,Hanmilton Beach 31160,I am dissapointed that I must return this product. The unit's overall dimensions are much larger than the description states. If you are looking for a toaster oven with a low height of 7 1/4 inches this isn't for you!
2,Still Mopping Floor,"Although some of the spillage is reduced, my dog still manages to makean aquatic wonder of my kitchen floor. The bowl is very hard to empty and clean due to the wide inset lip. I have decided that if I have to put up with water all over the place, I may as well at least have a bowl that is easy to clean...back to the old bowl."
1,Parts,"I have been trying to find repair cartriges for this faucet. On-line they want $8.00 shipping. In the local hardware stores (HD,Lo and Ace) they have a cartrige that is suppose to fit, but it is to large for the hole. I am afraid to order the on-line cart for fear I will be paying to much for the samething I have been dealing with. What happen to the goood old faucet that you could install an new washer for .60 cent, instead of a cart for $6.00,if you get the right one. It seems that these cart are the trend of the industry. Every vendor is going to a cart and everyone is using a different cart for every different faucet and respective hot or cold of that faucet. VENDORS, MANUFACTURERS are you listening. GO BACK TO THE RUBBER WASHER."
1,"Cheap, poor quality watch",I went to put the watch on for the first time and the small loop that holds the extra length of band ripped off. The second day I owned it I dropped it (who doesn't drop a watch from time to time?) and the second hand broke off and the back of the watch fell out. What a mess! And all within the first 24 hours of having it. DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH unless you plan on never wearing it.
4,Entertaining journey on the lighter side of Buddhism,"I actually enjoyed this book quite a bit. Osho's approach to Buddhism is truly something else. It's so down-to-earth. Sometimes, while I was reading the book he seemed not to make any sense, then immediately on the opposite page he imparts such deep insights that it gave me the goose bumps. Osho doesn't seem to be afraid to speak whatever is on his mind and is not afraid to hurt your feelings or beliefs. Which makes this book a very straight, in your face, nonetheless entertaining read.I would not recommend to rely on this book as a foremost spiritual guide, but there are certainly many ways to look at Buddhism, and this is one of them. Entertaining, sometimes funny, sometimes deep, sometimes confusing. Truly a mirror to life. Worth a read either way."
2,Mac users left out in the cold,"Bought this camera when it first came out, and it takes pretty good pics, but I have a Mac and Nikon does not keep up the software, including the wireless transfer, with Mac OS (I now use Lion). My next choice for camera will be a Canon, better pic quality and friendlier to Macs."
4,Good Latin starter for the younger student,"This is a great Latin starter for the younger grades. The pronuciation is ecclesiastical. We are not Catholic, but found the program very useful for learning the inital grammar rules. It is designed for an independent reader, although you can adapt to a non-reader. The lessons are laid out nicely, introducing about 6 words per lesson, in addition to lines from a prayer. The grammar rules are explained simply and a young child can catch on quickly. The words are laid out on the page aesthetically and there are no cartoons or other frills to distract the teacher or the child, like some programs.I have seen a few other Latin Primers and find this to be one of the better ones for the younger grades."
2,Uninvolving and uninspired,"By the time your neck deep in this game you've had all the phoney accents you can stand. This game is a mish-mash of cliche's and stereotypes piled high on a bed of repeditive task that seemingly get you nowhere. Sure, you rise among the family, people speak to you more nicely and all, but in the end you keep getting sent oun on the same crappy jobs.The better plan would have made this a tactical game, you play as the Don, and control and expand your empire. But no, you play as a grease spot working his way up the ranks and you do the same things over and over and over and over and over again."
4,Good Improved Game,"So much improvement from previous versions of Godfather the Game. I own an older copy for the PC which did not have an outdoor food market, casinos, favor missions, and unique compounds. I could destroy more things in businesses, plant car bombs, and so much more. The customization of character is pretty much the same as the older game."
4,Very entertaining,Buying this game I knew it wouldn't be the best game ever made but I was very pleased with the purchase.This game is hours of fun and the storyline is simpleIf you want a fun game to just sit down and relax for a weekend this game is the one
2,I hate this book comming from a 15 year old,"i hate this book. im 15 and i attend h.s. my teacher assighned us to read it. i think this is one of the worst books i have ever read. if i had to read this book again i rather fail the class then read that book again. its begining makes you want to sleep, its middle makes you want to sleep, and its end makes you want to sleep.if your thinking about getting this book for a teenager, think again !!!!!"
5,"CAR,DOG,CAT,HOUSE,FLUFY scott oooooooo smells",THIS IT A VERY EVIL BOOK IT ATE ME AND MY BROTHER.......I REALLY LIKE I
3,Vivid description of the life of a Native American boy.,"The main character, Tom Black, faces many conflicts throughout the book. He begins in the mountains, and travels for several years. His conflicts are vividly described and he incorporates his traditions and upbringing in the way he solves his conflicts. His life teaches many lessons to the reader, although it is a rather slow read and a fairly long book."
1,Garbage,"The 1st FIVE Chapters were missing, the book started on page 265. I will never do business with this vendor again."
4,It tells of an indian boy who struggles to accept who he is.,I thought that this was a very good book. I had to read it for a book report and I thought that it would not interest me at all. I was wrong. I actually wanted to read this book once I got started. I think that the author told the story in a very creative way. I like the ending when Tom decides to go back to living the old ways.
5,A wonderful book for those interested in Iran.,"For those interested in Iran, Tara Bahrampour gives a wonderful view of her loved homeland which she lived as a child. She describes delightfully her older childhood years in American and then has inciteful descriptions when she returned to Iran as a young woman. Her Iranian family is warm and interesting. I feel I know Iran better after reading her book. I especially like her use of Farsi words throughout her book. John J. Casalino"
1,This book was a drag,This book was suggested to me by a dear friend. I was very excited to read it and was sadly disappointed. I didn't care at all about Tara's life. I found her to be very insecure in the way she spoke of everyones attration towards her; this was annoying after a while. This book was a drag.
1,So damn boring,"This writer seems to be infatuated with herself. She's very insecure; in that, she constantly feels like everyone's attracted to her. a very dumb book to say the least."
2,Fair,"This book falls below what I would expect from Oxford (at least the traditional Oxford of yester-year). The pictures are nice as well as a lot of the text. The main problem with this book is the chapter ""The Vikings in History and Ledgend."" The author of this essay insinuates that those who take pride in their Viking heritage are Nazis. This chapter is full of inappropriate partisan politics and hurts this book. It reads like propoganda straight out of a typical ADL hate tract.One reader has obviously fallen for this line (see below).There are far-better books on the Vikings out there. Go for Gwen Jones for a more balanced account."
1,Taught me to hate rechargables,"These truly suck. I thought I would go a little more ""green"" by buying rechargables, but they are a headache to deal with. I'll leave them in the charger long enough to obtain a full charge, then store them in a drawer for later. Too bad that when later comes, the power is completely drained from the batteries. They are terrible in Wii Remotes, they last a week in remote controls, and hold charge even less during storage. If I hadn't paid so much, I would have thrown them in the garbage. Never again."
1,Duracell NiMH Battries are terrible...,"I have purchase several set of Duracell NiMH batteries and with the exception of the first set the battery life has been terrible. They do not hold a charge, even after charger indicates they are at full charge. I bought the Walmart no name brand at the same time and this past weekend the Duracell took 10 pictures with my SLR digital and the Walmart battries took 350, with 1/3 using a flash. I use a powerex charger at the lowest setting to charge my battries. When I called Duracell to complain I was told that you could only use their brand of charger. I laughed at the lady when she tried to tell me that their $12 chargers would do a great job charging. I think this is the third set I have had issues with. I have learned my lesson and will stay away from this brand in the future."
1,Not good batteries,"I bought some of the AA Duracell 2650 mAh NiMH batteries and the Duracell 15 minute charger model CEF15NC to use with my digital camera. The batteries do not hold a charge at all. Some of the worst rechargable NiMH batteries I have ever had the displeasure of using. I put the batteries in the charger and after about 15 minutes it indicates the batteries are charged. Put them in the camera and after one or two shots the low battery indicator shows. If I don't use the freshly charged batteries right away and try to use the camera after a day or two there is absolutely no charge in the batteries. I have tried charging them in other chargers overnight and the same situation. They do not hold a charge. I even bought another set of the Duracell batteries to see if maybe the first set were bad, but the new ones would not hold a charge either."
5,kickin it back to the old school...,I bought this because it was a favorite when I was little...and I never forgot about it! Just a wonderful story!
5,Very Good,Anyone who wants to know more about the history of the Orthodox Church needs to read this book. It is excellent.
2,my guineas don't seem to like this much,"My cuties usually eat lots of hay. This hay kind of sits there. They'll pick at it, but not at the rate or with the gusto they attacked their previous hay. I will not buy again. Some of the pieces of brown, maybe this stuff is old or something."
3,Like the product.,"I haven't used the product yet. I will be using it this weekend. However, I was taken aback when I only received one. So, I had to order another one. I wound up spending over 22 bucks. Please read the advertisment closely to make sure you are getting what you want."
2,Deceiving photo,I looked at the picture when I ordered and thought I was getting two medium size bowls. I got one tiny 8 once bowl...that my pit bull can drink in one gulp. Waste of money :-P
2,There's only ONE cup in the box,"I read the reviews on a different size of this cup and they didn't mention that there was only one cup in the box even though the picture says there are two. Very deceptive. I am using the cup for water and it works. A little tricky to get it on, had to get creative with the angle of the back brace."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The picture was misleading as it made me think there were two bowls, and the holder the bowl rests on seems bent so it doesn't stand well. Too much of a hassle for me to try to send it back. So, I use the bowl for scooping the dog's food out of the bag."
2,Broke pretty easily,"The wire to attach it to the crate broke, and the metal bowl is easily damaged. We still use the bowl, and I've since learned that elevating a food bowl is dangerous for dogs, but I'm still not a fan of how cheap the material was."
2,Almost Worthless,"The little black band is not attached to the bowls so if your animal so much as touches the bottom, it will fall out. They are resting on one screw that goes between the bars so there is nothing that keeps them from tipping. If you try to tighten the screws to hold it in place, the cheap black metal bar bends. We threw out the metal and just use the cups to measure out portion size for our dog's meals."
5,Great for crates,"I bought both sizes. Smaller for a puppy in a crate, and larger now that the pup is getting bigger. (Lab) They work great for me. Easy to install. They stay put. Pup has to really work at it to spill them. [He has never been able to completely remove the dish from the holder. Can refill through screen with a watering can. Are just simple, but work slick."
2,Coop Cup,I did not care for this item. The dog is constantly knocking over her food and water no matter where you put the cup. My dog now uses it as a chin rest.
2,Too Bad Half Were Bent,"These would be nice, however, the rings and bar were so bent the bowls tip out. I won't be purchasing these again, as they're evidently not checked for defects and it seems half of what you order will be defective. I gave 2 stars for the few of them that were at least usable (though also bent)."
1,Bowl hanger poorly made/Thank U Amazon for easy return lables,"The wing nuts appear to have been paint coated while screwed onto the bolts, making it difficult to remove the wing nuts. Hand tightening them to attach to kennel was also difficult, the threading seemed off. The wings on one of the nuts both broke off in my hand while I was trying to attach them. There is only one bolt on each hanger causing the bowl loop holders to hang crooked when my tiny 12 lb.dog attempted to eat from it. These hangers are made of very flimsy material. The bowls are fine, although made from very thin metal. I wouldn't buy this type again. I must praise Amazon for offering easy to print out, prepaid shipping labels for return. So happy, that I have already ordered another set of 2, of a different type."
3,didn't hold up,"My dog is crazy and knocks this off the cage, takes the bowl out, and gets water everywhere!! for a normal dog I'm sure these bowls would be great!"
2,Not Sturdy,"Good product, but doesn't stay in place due to single wing-nut design. I'd try the one with double wing-nuts.If you have a dog that wont push on it while in the crate (or wherever you mount it), it'll be fine."
1,Unbelievable,"I heard about this book from a search of Harry Potter. I cannot believe someone actually wrote a book for the purpose of claiming certain entertainment is the work of Satan, therefore I have not read it and never will. I am not a Christian anymore, haven't been for years, and this is why. The pathetic narrow-mindedness of SOME Christians reminds me very much of times when people were accused of witchcraft because they were different. Harry Potter is NOT evil, it is simply fun, and Pokemon is a simple video game with cutesy characters that broadened into much more. Anyone who sees evil in these will see evil in anything, and should seriously look into his/herself to find the root of the problem. If you want to find and fight evil, why don't you watch the news. Ask yourself if you really want to buy this because you think Harry Potter or Pokemon is evil and why you think that, or if you just dislike them both because they are everywhere."
1,THIS IS THE FUNIEST WASTE OF TIME EVER,Wow! Poeple who use other poeple's successful writings to put money in their own wallets by writing a load of crap is actually pretty funny. Poeple who think they're good Christians should be out trying to do good for the world and not sit around trying to make a big deel out of a childerens book. Poeple who acuse harry potter of being evil must have missed all the christ like morals that it teaches or just be to dim to stand up straight.
5,Crying,"This anime is extremely sad! (in fact, the version i watched had a disclaimer after a certain episode that read ""If you want a happy ending, stop watching right now) and that wasn't an episode late in the series. But the emotions this anime brings out is what makes it amazing.First of all, you MUST suspend your ideas about ""space"" that is, things FITTING inside something. Chisa, the main character, has been turned into a weapon by the army...at times even huge missiles fall from her back. But you have to let scenes like this go and not sit there thinking about the laws of physics. This is a story about love and war...and how the two affect each other...and about who wins, and, more importantly, who loses.check it out"
4,"Smashing performance, fine bonus","If no one else, Mariss Jansons and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra can convince me that Ein Heldenleben is a great piece of music. They play it with the utmost passion as well as probing sensitivity to the composer's idiom. Sound and film of this 2004 live recording are quite good, but not outstanding. This reading lets you forget the narcissistic, self-glorifying composer, his stylizing himself into a ""hero's"" role and the Nietzschean overtones of the symphonic poem's program. Richard Strauss was certainly no hero, as demonstrated by his later quick and painless accommodation with the Nazi regime. Regardless, the music can speak for itself, and here it does very well. The bonus documentary is very appealing: it brings together Janson's own biography with the tenure of his predecessors at the Concertgebouw and has samples of Mengelberg's, van Beinum's, Haitink's and Chailly's work. Despite the somewhat forbidding price, highly recommended."
5,In Plane Sight,This is another series that I enjoy very much. I have the whole series and I wish they would bring this back for some more seasons.
3,"Looses it luster,after baby in series and obviously real life,is born","I really enjoyed this show for 4 seasons but this final season was a mistake, the actors are off center and lost the flow, as it seems Mary did have a baby in real life it, which squashed the show , a complete opposite of character Mary. Congrats on her new baby but she needs to and did move on, I only saw the first premier episode, which was painful to watch, Having hard in your face Mary turn into a fake hard Mother while goggling her baby, Looked like she did use her own baby which would be cool, anyway its conflicting in her devotion to the job of Marshall,to bad her partner and her didn't get together, everything ends, Good Luck"
1,A Collosally Disappointing End to what would have been a great show...,"This show went through a lot- the loss of its creator and writer after USA network decided his writing was ""too dark."" A run-of-the-mill third season, the loss of a second writer due to health issues, and the out-of-character pregnancy of the lead actress. Fans stuck by through all of this because we loved what David Maples created back in 2008. By the time we'd come through it all, the show was a mere semblance of its former glory, but there was still hope that the new writers wouldn't let the fans down. Sadly, all it was was hope. After watching the series finale, I was left feeling that I'd wasted five years of my life by getting invested in these characters. After this, I will never, as long as I live, watch another USA network series. Good riddance."
3,"Good for security, not so good for the conveniance oriented","As stated by another reviewer, this product is designed to add security to your workstation. The Sony Puppy does not actually replace the need to type a username and password, rather, it adds a third layer of security by ALSO requiring a fingerprint.If it's a password-replacement biometric device you are after, check out the vastly cheaper ($32) Microsoft DG2-00002. It instead of adding a layer, it associates website/windows/document passwords with your fingerprint.In the end, MS vs Sony dependes on your needs. Are you trying to beef up security or increase conveniance?"
4,Slappa Rule,"I have been running out of space for CD and DVD storage for quite a while now, so I thought I would try a hard case CD holder. WOW is all I can say, the construction and feel of the case is excellent. The album covers can be stored in the front of the clear pocket and the CD in the rear section, but as noted by a previous reviewer this halves the storage capacilty to 120 CD's.I have been so impressed by the Slappa line I have purchased 4 of the DVD storage case (holds 90 DVD's each).Thanks Slappa."
4,Much Better Than Hard Storage Sheds,I have two of these units and if you make sure you don't tear it upon assembley or receive a torn unit they work great. I still put most of the items I store inside with a cover or some protection should there be a tear. These are much more flexible as far as moving then something like a Rubbermaid. Perhap it won't hold up for years but I have a Rummbermaid storage unit that I paid close to $500 for and after a few years it still boke down and down and started to leak. The aluminum ones just look gawd awful after a few years and the wood ones are like adding on another room-very pricey.So for the money these units are great-takes less than a hour to assemble vs a half day for conventional units. For the dollars a good buy.
4,Good Choice,"I like the product,easy on and off,Increases the view down the side of my fifth wheel trailer just fine,purchased another set for a friend as well.They look like O.E.M..."
4,Towing Mirrors for Ford F150,The mirrors worked great and were easy to use. The mirrors fit like OJ's glove and what a great view along side my 27' travel traier.
1,In my opinion.............save your money. This is a cheaply made piece of Chinese junk.,In my opinion............... Made of light weight material it is a good example of the dangers of buying on line. After getting it put together I see no way it will handle the job for any lenght of time unless you use very light weight hose.
1,"Not worth the money, tires are crap",I purchased this item from Lowes. I had to fix the leaky problem which was nothing more than tightening an allen hex screw. My problem is the tires. All the tubes are rotten and the tires are flat. I do not understand the advantage of having tires that hold air. It is not an off road unit. Fairly good solid rubber would function just fine. I would not recommend this item unless you have the ambition to store it indoors whenever it is not in use. I am sure that sitting outside exposed to the sun and weather is probably going to cause premature part(s) failure.
1,unhappy,"I bought this cart two years ago at Loews. The coating is flaking off and the tubing and fasteners are rusting. Another ""bargain"" product made in China, I am shopping on Amazon today for a replacement. I am not sure what you have to do to buy something of reasonable quality? This is not a give away price."
5,Yet another alternate universe,"magical project s is a new and fresh way of looking at tenchi muyo, the characters are similar but once again the story has changed completely and if you are a fan of the tinchi saga this maybe some thing for you!"
4,First-time visitor who felt like a regular,"Rick Steves'suggestions helped us to get the most out our week in London. From how to get and use a weekly transit pass to pubs and restaurants, we found his examples to be excellent. His philosophy of enjoying anyplace through interaction with local folk is shared by us and made our visit one that continues to enrich us. I just received email from a Londoner we met in Churchill's Pub and we're looking forward to ""tipping a few"" in the future. Buy this book, read it, plan your trip to your needs, and get the most out of this great city..."
4,Birthday Present for 7 year old Girl,"We bought this for my daughter's friend who was celebrating her 7th birthday in June. When my daughter gave the birthday girl her present, she seemed very thrilled to discover it was a Puppy in My Pocket. They are smaller and cuter than Littlest Pet Shop and frankly, different. So the birthday girl was happy to receive them over another set of LPS. I was glad that we were able to give her something special."
2,Disappointed,"I was buying this cam as an upgrade to my Axis 2100 cam which I absolutely adored. The image on the 2100 was bright, vibrant, and very clear. The Axis 205 looked like the 2100 only better, so I didn't hesitate to purchase it when I started looking for another security camera.There are many improvements it has over the 2100, it can handle twice the amount of viewers, and has many more options that I wish the 2100 had.However, I was extremely dissapointed to find that the picture quality is not even much better than your standard USB webcam. I tried adjusting all of the settings but the quality improved only slightly.I ended up returning it, rather reluctantly. I can't believe the quality of the picture is so different from their older version of this network cam. Very dissapointing, and not worth it's price."
5,Colt Winner,Excellent as always from the Colt Studios!! Nice to see a couple older photos in the mix this time too!!
1,I thought it says 4 per package? I only got one,"Product DescriptionIdeal for head, foot or leg elevation. removable, zippered, machine washable polyester/cotton cover. replacement covers available. foam meets cal #117 requirements. ""4 per package"". color: white. size: 10 inch x 24 inch x 24 inch.I only received one, either they shipped wrong or the seller is misleading me."
5,Good price,"There's not a lot of pages to this book of poems. But for $1.50, it's not a bad deal. I would recommend buying this."
3,Great whilei it lasted,I would give it a five but because I really like bass I had this poor unit all the way turnd up i eventually burned the amp out bummer but when it worked this sub put out solid bass I eventually bought the Polk Audio SW 505 as a replacment. If your not going to have it turned all the way up all the time this is a great subBIC America V-1220 12-Inch 430-Watt Down-Firing Powered Subwoofer
5,great for the price.,"Over the past two years I have been upgrading my parents home theater system for them. This Christmas I decided to finally upgrade their sub. After much research I decided to try out the BIC. This thing blowes their old HTIB sub away. Actually it also destroys my Polk sub as well. Once you tune this to your rooms acoustics you will get plenty of lows with any movie you watch. Gladiator, Cars, Star Trek and Transformers all come alive with this sub. I would highly recommend BIC subs to anyone now. Great price/performance."
1,Horrible,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I turned it off as soon as I put it on!! ugh!! I was expecting a classy fusion of arab like spanish chanting with a middle eastern orchestra, but it sounded more like a confused piece of flamenco on drugs."
3,Well...,"Decent episode of MST3K for sure. Probably not in the top 10 though a lot would disagree with this assessment. BUT, as a ""special edition"" release this seems (based on the description of what's included) to be a bit less-than special. More like Shout! trying to milk this cash-cow dry.Personally I'll be holding out until 2015 when Shout! releases the ""Special-special Edition"" which will likely include actual DNA samples of the original MST3K cast, skin flakes from Mary Jo's 1993 chemical peel, a selection of Joel's childhood fingernail clippings, a Kevin Murphy urine sample, and a 30-second ""short"" on the making of Kevin's urine sample."
1,Something worse then Manos,"As a collector of all things MST3K related, I can honestly say that, despite what others might say, Manos IS NOT the worst movie I've seen. Although Manos is awful in many ways it doesn't come close to ""santa and the ice cream bunny"". I think the only way to get this movie is the rifftrax version but then watching it without them is extremely painful. Watch this one (if you dare) and see if you don't agree."
5,I loved how it was so real!,I was never really interested in Elvis Presley until i saw this amazing movie! It was so romantic and exciting!
3,Purchase of Elvis and Me dvd,"Love the movie, however i was a little dissapointed when I realised that the dvd was a burnt copy and i paid over $30.00 Australian dollars for it. I thought because i was paying that amount for a DVD that i was going to receive an real copy, not an illegal copy!However i still loved the movie, the quality isnt very good on the big screen, however ok on a small tv."
5,Great Movie!,This is the best movie ever! I 've been looking for this movie for the last two years and I would like to know if anyone out there has the movie.
5,thorough reference,"This DVD is very helpful and one of the best educational tools on foraging wild food. I also highly recommend his books. My favorite part was seeing him harvesting rice and dry storing it. I too agree on what has been previously said about the packaging, but I do appreciate the efforts in trying to keep it echo-friendly. Overall, I highly recommend all Samuel Thayer's works."
3,Well Done Research,"This book gets Three Stars for the research! In contrast to Stefan Kanfer's recent biography of Groucho, this book delves alot deeper into the vaudeville origins of the Brothers and their comedy style. Also Louvish has done some admirable work spotlighting the early days of Groucho's foil, Margaret Dumont. There is a helpful bibliography at the end, as well as a helpful list of the Marxes' film and radio work. (Surprise! Their last film wasn't Love Happy, it was actually Irwin Allen's The Story of Mankind.) I have to agree with some of the comments here about Louvish's writing style--he occasionally becomes a bit overenthusiastic. Like fans of Monty Python or Star Trek, it is hard for him to get through a paragraph without making some reference to the shows. This is overall, pretty forgiveable considering the work he has done.This has been a good year for fans of the Marx Brothers, probably the most new books out at one time since the 1970's. I hope we will continue to see more."
5,Great for kids that love animals,"My boys LOVE animals, especially ducks, so this is a big hit. If you like ""Silly Little Goose"" by the same author, this one's sure to be popular in your house."
1,"a piece of garbage, and awful customer service","i bought this chain saw. i took it home and was surprised at how much of it was plastic, and how junky it felt. it was hard to imagine that this product would last very long.i never had the opportunity to find out. it would not start. when i called the homelite customer service number i was put on hold for a half hour. when i dialed the sales number, they picked up instantly - apparently they have lots of people working to take your order, but no one available when their rotten product doesn't work.i brought it back to home depot, and they couldn't get it to work either. i cannot believe what a terrible product this is, and how poorly supported. the person answering the phone for homelight said they only have one person on the phone answering customer problems ""because it is a sunday"" - for all the money they make selling their awful products, they can hire a few people to answer the phone. i will never buy one of their products again."
3,Bad Hair,"Cute Doll except for the hair. Dora's hair was held in place by a thin strip of saran wrap. Without the saran wrap the hair was a mess, bald in the middle, and long enough for a stub of a pony. Really cheapened up the doll."
2,dora,Waste of money not entertaining at all no bigger than your hand and half of your forearm. you can find something on here a lot better for less money.
3,VERY NICE DOLL,I bought this doll for my 18 months baby because she watches Dora The Explorer on TV and lovs her. It's a very well made doll and the size is perfect for her to carry around comfortably. She plays a lot with the little camera that came within the backpack. Overall it was a good purchase.
4,Great for Toddlers,I bought this for my grand daughter that is only 23 months and she love it. She is repeating the words already. Shipment received as scheduled.
3,Not as fun as I thought,The doll is cute and my daughter liked it but I thought it had more than just 3 phrases. I guess I'm a bit dissapointed but I would still recommend it.
3,Fisher-Price Dora the Explorer Talking Dora Surprise,"This doll is cute and my 4 year old grand daughter just loves it, but my only complaint is her hair, it does not lay down well, it is very messy and un kept. I put a headband on her to make her hair look neater, but it does not really stay on well.So, I would look at other Dora dolls instead for the next purchase, only because of her hair."
1,To hard to use,"Bought a few, tried several times and then threw them away. They are to complicate to use, a total waste of money."
2,Didnt help for me...,"This mouth guard is quite bulky, and is too uncomfortable to sleep with. The fitting instructions are ok, and I had a good fit at first, but after dipping the piece into cold water, the material contracted slightly making it exert noticeable pressure on my teeth when wearing it. I reboiled it and this time let it cool slowly after fitting, and it feels better, but I have a hard time keeping it from falling out... I think im going to purchase something with a different design (even if they are more expensive)."
1,Terrible!,"Fitting is impossible. Very bulky and uncomfortable, very hard material. I actually threw mine away after endless attempts to fit. Once I finally got some sort of impression, it cooled to be so hard that it was unusable. I have emailed the company before but have never had a response from them."
1,sucky sucky sucky,Not ready for prime time. Hard to fit to mouth. Turns yucky color after a few weeks. Ever sleep with a hockey puck in your mouth?
3,a little hard to sleep with,"I have used one of these before, starting to wonder if different size or thickness. However, been having trouble sleeping with this one so far. Like anything it takes time, but thinking one that has less thinkness would be preferable."
1,Horribly bulky. Can't close my mouth around it!,"Awful, awful, awful! I bought it to replace an old one I had professionally made for me by my dentist. I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new ""proper"" one, but if this is my only option I'd rather spend the money. The one from the dentist fits on the lower teeth and fits INSIDE the mouth. This one fits on the upper teeth, doesn't allow you to close your mouth and give you a buck-toothed appearance. Quite sexy!"
1,Lousy,"This product is not ready for prime-time. What you are supposed to do is boil the protector in water and then press the scalding hot appliance into your teeth a good 3-4 millimeters. Even if you can take the heat the appliance does not get soft enough to really get your teeth in that far. The best I could manage was a ""dent"" in the plastic. Even if you do get your teeth into it there is so much spillover on the sides that you'll not be able to close your mouth and you'll wake up in a puddle of drool. So you will spend hours cutting and shaving the appliance to try to get something usable and in the end you'll wind up just returning it for a refund."
2,There are better pumps out there,I bought one of these in an emergency. It's probably the poorest quality pump I've ever purchased. It's noisy and seems like it's made entirely out of plastic. The float is very finicky and doesn't always turn on. I bought a new Little Giant - the old one worked great for 12 years - and gave this one back. I can't imagine this one holding up over the long haul.
4,Good - but not what I thought,"I bought the Splendor of Malta thinking it was going to have lots of photos of the country and buildings from the outside etc. It's absolutely packed full of pictures of insides of different buildings and has tons of history and information. It's a very good book, just not what I thought I was getting."
5,Trick or Treat Murder: A Lucy Stone Mystery,"As expected, a well written mystery. Great characters and setting. I find the Lucy Stone series relaxing and enjoyable reads. Especially entertaining for anyone who has ever lived in or been to any of the small towns in Maine!"
1,Gets one star because it does make heat,"We've bought more of these than I care to admit, due to them being the only bulb available at the nearest pet store. They do make heat, my bearded dragon is not suffering, but my gas tank and wallet are. These bulbs burn out entirely too fast. Usually within a month, sometimes more quickly. I'm going to start ordering better ones online. Even if it ends up costing the same, I'll have less frustration."
1,Both bust within 10 days,One bulb broke in 1 week and the other after 9 days... Definitively not worth the purchase. Maybe I just got a bad batch?
2,I dont think much of it,"I watched it, and I did'nt think much og it, it made me think about the money I spent on it. Werent that long, the ending were a bit sudden, and that was it."
2,Might have been........,"This film had alot of ALMOST'S in it. it was almost good, the characters were almost likable. It did have a good ""feel"" to it, the intangible feeling you get when you watch a truly good movie. However there were too many negatives for it to be truly any good. ....The only character that stood out was Mephisto and he ruled. The last issue i had with this movie was its sound distracted from the feel of the movie. I would suggest this only to long time watchers of anime, a starting watcher might be turned away from the genre with this movie"
3,Nice,"The album is as nice as the single I heard here in Chicago on WDCB. The next time I hear their name mentioned, I'll be a little more critical as to the soul or grit of their play."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"Cuts the rind nicely. Not so sure about separating the rind from the orange though (leaves a lot of the white pericarp behind). I find it easier to use my finger to remove the rind once it's been cut, then you don't have to rely on the scraping part of the tool afterward."
1,DON' T BUY FROM WIRE WHISK,"**** BUYER BEWARE **** The Pampered Chef Citrus Peelers sent by WIRE WHISK were not the ones advertised. The ones pictured in Amazon are of very different in shape, color and material density. I have owned Pampered Chef Citrus Peelers and what WIRE WHISK sent were not even close. They don't answer to emails. **** BUYER BEWARE ****"
1,Defective peeler,I ordered 5 at 1 cent each. I was charged $37 for shipping and 3 of the 5 were defective with irregular plastic blobs where the cutting surface should be. Big waste of money.
4,citrus peeler,"I got one of these years ago and it broke in half and it works well on oranges and missed having one and could not find another until found on Amazon.com. I ordered it right away then found many at the dollar section at my local hardware store afterwards. Could have saved me S&H charges which was more then the item itself. Great item and would recommend, especially for navel oranges."
1,duracell CP1,batteries were old ...I could take about 3 pictures before the camera started showing it was dying and battery failure within 5 minutes
2,"Great Actors, just bad production and script.","This movie had the potential to be great. I really loved the actors chosen Robin Givens, Mel Jackson, Miguel Nunez, etc.But the script was a little weak. It did have its funny moments, but I'd recommend renting it before you buy it. However it is $4 to rent for 48 hours from Amazon,(thats what I did) yet it costs less than $7 to buy. Not a good sign."
2,NOT SO PLEASED!!!!,"I installed this on my ram 4.7 but didn't like the out come, made my engine sound really weird and vibrated like crazy when gas was jammed to the floor, I DONT SPEED.....i removed it and went to the regular K&N replacement filter, i have always loved and will remain a fan of K&N for life i just don't think this was properly made for my 2008 dodge ram 1500 4.7 V8"
5,Great Social Study of Pre-Vietnam Americans.,Worth it for the human factors alone. Society was more clear-eyed before liberal media fuddled us up. This is America with clear vision.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"When I saw this, I thought it would be a good item for me because I make quesdillas for lunch most days. After using it ONE time.... I discovered that I could make them faster and easier using a big frying pan on top of the stove. Since that is the way I made them before..... this was a total waste of money. The only reason I gave it 1 star is that it's a great color. It is now just taking up cupboard room and will be thrown away or sold at a garage sale soon."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I like the idea, I make a lot of tortillas and quesidillas, but this doesn't do a very good job. Its biggest problem is that all the cheese just melts right out the sides, making it messy, and not very filling."
2,Not impressed,I wasn't thrilled with this machine. It flattens the tortilla and pushes all of the cheese out the end and onto the grill. The only thing that makes me happy about this is that I don't burn the tortilla if I walk away for a minute.
4,Simplicity at its best!!,I found the quesadilla maker a great addition to my kitchen. IT is easy to use and the food comes out tasting great. I have since ordered 2 more one for my daughter and the other for a daughter-in-law. It makes cooking a simple meal much easier for them with their families. The only draw back is the clean up I would prefer everything to be either immersible or dishwasher safe. However it wipes out pretty easily.
5,I really do enjoy my quesadilla maker,Since I found it marked down at 10 percent at a local drugstore. I have been having a blast making these quesadillas with this. I have made them before in the past using various other gadgets but found this to be the ideal way to make them. Before I'd get them on my grill griddle the fillings would fall out. same with my george foreman grill. This happens to be the easiest way and most fun way to make those. So far I have made plain cheese ones and Pizza quesadillas. I just love this and I know most will too.
3,Save your money and use a skillet.,"I adore quesadillas. The quesadilla maker is good to turn out what I would classify as minimally acceptable quesadillas, but not outstanding quesadillas. I found that I was able to crank out a much better quesadilla in my skillet. The secret is to weight the quesadilla down on each side so it gets a nice brown, crispiness to it. While I could get a relatively crisp quesadilla in the maker, I couldn't get the same golden brown as in my skillet. The time to make and clean was the same, and at a party, I use an electric griddle. So, this appliance just wastes space in my kitchen."
2,Quesadilla Maker a disappointment!,"Despite the modest price (and a few rave reviews) I have to rate this product as a disappointment. It works well if all you want is something to warm your tortillas with a modest amount of filling in between, but stay away from the accompanying recipes. I feel certain they weren't tested with the product for all provide too much filling for the griddle to cleanly handle. As for the unit itself, there is no on/off switch - you need to unplug it to accomplish that task. There is no timer only a suggestion that quesadillas require from 3 to 5 minutes. Also, there is no handle for raising the lid and the latch is not a satisfactory substitute. I had ordered (since cancelled) another unit as a gift but after using the product realized it would not be up to standard as a satisfactory gift. The bottom line - great device for warming tortillas, but unsatisfactory for anything more than the simplest of quesadillas."
1,Who let HIM out?!,"WHY this man is permitted to write, and HOW his ""work"" gets published is a mystery to me-and surely any other poor soul who has had the misfortune to stumble painfully upon his excuse for prose. Perhaps there is a good use for his ""books""-severe punishment for wrong doers. Anyone who has to sit and be forced to listen to or read these books (and yes, there is quite a bibliography) will rapidly recant and get back on the path of straight and narrow in short order. A good gift for someone you utterly detest."
4,Very good mix of historical fiction and fantasy,"O'Donohoe writes a pleasingly different kind of fantasy novel. He doesn't stick to your typical sweeping epic fantasy saga, a la Jordan, Tolkien, Tad Williams, Eddings, etc., but rather uses some imagination to open up the field. Here he solidly combines historical fiction, myth and fantasy in a tale of dwarves, gnomes and World War II. As always, he combines humor and drama, and relies upon realistic characters, something often left out in speculative fiction. His attention to detail, including such things as discussion of the 1944 World Series, is appreciated. Very much recommended."
3,Solid Entertainment,"This is a modest and entertaining book. Avoiding the usual tendency of fantasy novels to have epochal, and usually overwrought, clashes of good and evil, this is a clever fantasy with historical elements. The idea is that magic and magical creatures exist in the modern world. In this case, the author integrates magical metal working dwarves with the WWII war effort. Some good humor and period detail. The plot is a little loose but this is worthwhile entertainment."
1,Unpleasant Echortations,"I am a lover of modern music. Stravinsky, Webern, Messiaen, etc. I purchased this CD with the hopes of discovering another contemporary composer to add to my collection, but I was heartily disappointed by the music on this disc. Much of it sounds like Alban Berg in its romantic-style atonality, but it lacks the emotional intensity found in Berg's works. The special effects, which Mr. Simpson seems quite excited about in his own review of the work at Amazon.com are interesting, but I find instrumental effects to be overdone ever since George Crumb, and the effects in the Exhortation for oboe are actually quite unpleasant to listen to. The other works on the disc are derivative and uninteresting. All in all, I would only recommend this CD to those who wish to help keep contemporary music alive by supporting young composers, not for anyone seeking musical enjoyment."
3,Big and ugly.,"Hideous. This fabric is an ugly of the involuntary-shuddering, gut-clenching type. Elicited such responses as ""God, that's ugly. You say he sleeps in that thing? How?"" But looks aren't everything. It's also enormous, for a rat. I wish I had seven or eight ratties, and they could all curl up in a pigpile and snuggle, but it was just the one guy. I only had to look at it for a week or so, until he'd destroyed it. I saved the metal clasps and whipped out the sewing machine to create more appropriate things for a guy his size. Maybe it's great for ferrets, but I would never buy anything like this for rats. It's too wasteful to buy one of these a week when I can make one in 15 minutes that won't cause seizures. UPDATE: The item pictured is not what I received. They must have updated the fabric to something a little less horrifying."
1,Horrible.,"In short: An incredibly arrogant American woman is involved in probably the most shallow ""humanitarian"" project I've ever heard of, inflates her role in a poorly written book about it, endangers many Afghan women in the process, then profits from book sales. This is appalling."
1,Don't bother,"Started out really interesting and then I couldn't have cared less if I finished the book. Bad writing. Self indulgent whining by the author. The idea of a beauty school to educate the women to be self sufficent is a great idea but not the book. There are many great books about the Middle East, try one of those."
5,We have it SO good!,"This book is full of stories of women who have had EXTREMELY hard lives and have managed to rise above it. Debbie Rodriguez does a great job of sharing their stories and telling us her story.While this book has chronological parts to it, many of the stories are told when a character is introduced. So you might feel like you are talking to your mother at times!After reading this, I realized how spoiled we are in America. Not a care in the world. There are so many things we can do that we take for granted, like leaving our house or having a boyfriend.I really enjoyed Debbie's storytelling and hearing these women's success stories."
5,A Good Read!,"It has been a while since I read this, but I loved it. This book gives us a glimpse into so many lives. It's a very unique and interesting read!"
3,"Serious subject, light writing.","Kabul Beauty School is an amazing memoir by a divorced American hairdresser. Debbie Rodriguez travels to Afghanistan and opens a cosmetology school so that women there can learn a marketable skill and make some money of their own. She then alternates her time between Afghanistan and her home back in the United States (though one does wonder about the fate of her two children in the middle of all this), eventually marrying an Afghan man. (Who later, as it turns out, already HAS a wife. Eeesh.). This book provides a riveting look at the lives of women in modern-day Afghanistan. To boot, Rodriguez has an irreverent personality and a wicked sense of humor. The book moves along very quickly, and I enjoyed reading it. Even though much of the text describes the terrible repression/abuse of Afghan women, it is written with a light touch."
3,Informative and inspiring.,"I enjoyed this book very much. It gave a look into the lives of Afghan women trying to make a positive step in their lives, sometimes when their husbands couldn't provide. They took it upon them selves to take a step toward financial independance for themselves and their families.What was a bit contradictory, perhaps, was how Debbie Rodriguez mentions a few times that the Afghan people were the warmest and most endearing people, however, it seems like most of her students and women there in general were being beaten by their husbands. It seemed every time she brought it up, somebody was getting beaten. So what's the deal?? Are the people only nice to women outside their families, or did she miss something in her writing to differenciate the two."
4,Recommended,I have read several reviews on this book - most praising Debbie's efforts to bring skills to Afghan women as well as to provide them with a space that is their own entirely. I have also read reviews that criticised her ways and how she was barging in with her American ways with little regard on how that might negatively affect the women she is trying to help. Overall my impression when reading this really enjoyable book was that Debbie is a woman with a full character that won't let much get in her way but that tries her best to make things work to get positive results for the women. It's very enlightening to read her own experience of Afghanistan and how she almost single handedly tries to bring a better future to some Afghan women. I think whatever cultural insensitivities she might be guilty of are due to her personality and spontaneity rather than an intention to shock. Recommended.
2,Beauty School Drop out,"Kabul Beauty School: An American Woman Goes Behind the VeilThe book starts out interesting, but very quickly becomes all about the author. Neither the author nor the ghost writer are strong writers. None of the side stories or characters are finished or ever mentioned again."
2,Ugly American fails beauty school,"It's worth reading if only for a view into cultural insensitivity and the lack of reflection that plagues our society. One can only marvel at Rodriguez' inability to reflect on the danger in which she places her former friends in Kabul by publishing this memoir. Her veracity is suspect in many passages (a solitary woman crossing the Hindu Kush without proper documents?)and the reader finds herself astonished at the author's refusal to reflect on how her beauty school perpetuates the subjugation of women in Afghanistan. Written in a folksy tone that only heightens her cloddish behavior, it's hard to be a patient reader."
4,Really interesting!,I enjoyed this book. It was a fast read and held my attention! I learned a lot about the lives of the Afghani women.
1,Concerned about the women she exposed,"After reading this book, I was so concerned about what would happen to these women in war torn Afganistan. I felt she revealed so much about them and then fled the country to probably never return."
5,Good Deal,"I have had very good luck purchasing reconditioned DeWalt tools. I have several and am very happy with all of them. I ordered and received this one in about 4 days. A case would have been nice, it comes in a cardbord box. The nailer is not as heavy as I thought it might be and I am able to get it into tight places. Like all the DeWalt nailers, the best feature is that you can see what you have loaded into it, Not so with the others. It drives and sets nails well with no jams or problems. I have a bad shoulder so a hammer is out of the question. This nailer is easy to handle. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Reconditioned Dewalt framing nailer works flawlessly.,"I have used my Dewalt D51844 framing nailer for about three weeks now finishing our new large basement and it has worked flawlessly. I have experienced no jams or problems. I am very pleased with it. I recieved the nailer in about a week after ordering. It was delivered without damage as you would expect. I would have liked a case for storage, but that's no big deal. As with all Dewalt products I have, this one is well built and works as you would expect it to. I'm more that satisfied."
2,resolution too low,"the resolution supported is too low in PIP mode. For anyone with a modern monitor, you will have to reduce your resolution to watch TV and work at the same time."
1,Hard to clean,"The fleece part absorbs food, and you have to really wash it out to clean it, then it dries forever. I really recommend going with a vinyl type bib without any cloth parts that can just be quickly rinsed and dried."
5,Only kind I can stand to wear!,"I love these! Yes, they are cheap! Yes they are disposable! and Yes, there are probably better sounding ones on the market. The bottom line is, comfort. These are so comfortable that I don't feel them there at all. I can listen for hours unlike the iPhone earphones or the other in your ear type, which hurt after some 3 minutes! I have been through about 4 pair and will keep a spare on hand as long as I can find them to buy! I wish other companies would make them as comfy."
4,Great Pictures,I bought this for my husband who LOVES light houses. When I saw this book I knew it was the right one for him. He loves this and pictures are great.BEAUTIFUL pictures. Words don't describe how great they are.
3,Sticky enough but cracks easily,"I've actually been quite happy with the PVC-laden mats we've all used for years, but wanted to see what the ECO mat was like. It's sticky enough, I like the thinness, but it cracks a bit when you roll it up. Doesn't seem like it's going to last as long as the old standard sticky mats."
3,I love this mat!,"Yes, I really like this mat! It's everything I was looking for. It even has a very pleasant odor like no other mat. The description of it included that it would break down in the dump to harmless particles which made me wonder how long it would last before it had to go to the landfill. I use it about twice a week or so. Last December I started using this mat and after just a few months of use the mat started to release (decompose?) particles where my feet stand in downward dog. Now I use the other side of the mat and it's almost like having a new mat! I'm sorry to see this wonderful mat wear out so fast. I hoped to have it longer than my older less expensive model."
3,Three excellent movies in this collection,"I don't know who some of these critics are who have reviewed the films in this John Wayne Collection from Universal, but they need to take another look. Everyone seems to put Shepard Of The Hills at the top of the list, but for me, Seven Sinners is by far the most entertaining. The problem for John Wayne fans may be that this terrific film is more of a vehicle for Marlene Dietrich than Wayne, but John Wayne gets to strut his stuff and holds his own. Pittsburgh is a good movie as well, although Wayne plays the bad guy for most of the film, but redeems himself in the end. Lighten up guys and give them a chance - you might enjoy yourselves."
4,UDERATED,"The great self appointed ""critics"" rake these movies over thecoals. They forget one important thing..Movies are for entertainment, they tell a story in a visual manner. They provide enjoyment for people. The movies in this set are good stories and give show some versitalty for John Wayne. The Shepherd of the Hills is one of my favorites. Teamed with Harry Carey, the Duke gives a very good performanve. Let people watch movies to be entertained. I have found that many critical acclimed films provide very little entertainment."
3,Justice for Shepherd of the Hills,"The previous reviewer was almost entirely correct--these are terrible movies with a single exception. Shepherd of the Hills is a fine production and deserves better than to be lumped with this other junk, or to be sweepingly condemned with them. Duke does sterling work in this movie and it is fascinating watching him alongside the great Harry Carey, Sr, who was one of Duke's early film idols. The set is cheaply priced; I will keep Shepherd of the Hills and use the rest for coasters."
5,Great BOOM for the buck,"Great job by the seller and the sub woofer works great. I have a BIC Ventura tower as my front speakers and this subwoofer is an excellent compliment. Played Jurassic Park and my room was shaking, the bass is strong and mellow. Not overpowering."
2,Not if you are a tiesto fan,"I heard a few of its tracks and decided to buy it....kinda disappointed. If you are looking for techno, proggy stuff...maybe ...but not for the core tiesto fans"
2,neck Brace,"I had it and was working great for 2 days, then all of a sudden i push the button so i could air in it and the button flew right off. It still works if i put some pressure on the hose , i guess what am saying is that its very cheaply constructed,"
1,Avanti buyer beware!!,"I purchased the Avanti EWC28 at the end of 2006. 4 years later it quit working. The solid state thermal-electric device went bad. When I called Avanti for parts, they said the unit was discontinued and no parts were available!! They told me to check my local Hardware store. Imagine that. Had to throw away the entire cooler. No more Avanti products for me."
1,Poor Experience - Expensive to own,"First cooler worked for 8 months and became very noisy(fan). Avanti Customer service shipped me a new unit. The second unit stopped cooling after 6 months. Customer service now tells me that I am outside the warranty period and that they cannot help me. I asked for a recommended service center and Avanti's response is ""The warranty period has expired, so we cannot help you"". Avanti would not even provide me with the name of an authorized service center for their product. Incredible!So, This Avanti product is costing me $200 a year to operate."
5,Getting Back by Mark Maller,"Getting Back tackles with humor and intelligence the often-contentious subject of religion and how it can enhance life or become a burden. Rob Silvers clashes with the narrow-mindedness of religion that has gone too far while confronting his own sense of morality. Ah, college! One of the things that sets this book apart from the others dealing with this topic is that we get to meet him again, twenty years after graduation. Highly recommended if you're looking for an interesting and unusual read."
5,A great tool to get your job search going,"This book gives you the information you need to get started on an effective job search. Kate Wendleton has done a great job. I recommend this book.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""The Accelerated Job Search"" docwifford@msn.com"
1,Terrible AM reception,"If you are a talk radio person like myself this radio's AM reception stinks so bad it's ridiculous.Unfortunately, I'm not sure where a person can find an honest review of car radio AM reception capabilities.Another issue with this radio is that it is terribly underpowered. Even when tuned in on a strong HD radio station I cannot turn up the volume high enough to get the sound adequately up and over the noise of the vehicle.Turn the volume up much beyond the 30 level (the digital level goes from 1 to 50) and the sound becomes so distorted you cannot understand it.I have some really awesome car radios, e.g., I have a 10 year old Sony CDX-4160 which blows this radio away on the AM stations, sitting in the same driveway.Avoid this radio if you want AM reception."
3,XM or iPod NOT BOTH,"I purchased this radio so I could have my XM and iPod on the same unit without having a separate XM tuner and to allow me to replace my OEM CD/AM/FM with a way to control my iPod and play it back.Out of the box, I learn that the product description here is not accurate. The tuner cannot control iPod AND satellite radio, rather you connect ONE to the ONE plug on the back.I paid an additional $45.75 for the XM connector cord, $44.49 for the iPod connection cables, and $48.36 for the XM tuner that connects to this radio. A total of $138.71 in addition to this radio's cost only to find out on receipt that I can only use one of these items. I could have saved either between $50 - $95 if I had known this radio can only do one at a time.The three star rating is solely for the lack of clarity in the description to allow consumers to save money when deciding to purchase accessories and not a reflection of the radio's performance itself."
3,JVC SKIPPER,"THE RADIO WORKS GREAT UNTIL YOU HIT THE TRAILS , IT SKIPS SO BADD ON THE SLIDDEST BUMP( OH YEH I PUT IT IN A JEEP WRANGLER). I STILL CANT FIGURE OUT THIS HD CRAP THAT PART OF THE RADIO SUCKS. THE EQ IS COOL WHEN YOU GET IT SET . I WOULD BUY ANOTHER JVC MAYBE THE UPGRADED VERSION."
2,Disappointed,"I got this for my daughter who is a big Dora fan. I was excited to see it was durable plastic. When I got it home and opened the box, I was disappointed, big time. The only thing entertaining about it was the talking backpack itself. The other things included were poorly put together to hold a childs imagination. I got it yesterday and already it is in the toy box. Next time I will check ratings before purchasing."
2,Backpack isn't even a backpack...,"You would think that by calling this a backpack, you would be able to wear it on your back. Nope. It doesn't even have straps or anything. You would have to carry it by the handle to tote it around, so my 2 year old calls it a purse. The toys inside are all kind of boring-they don't really do anything. My girls probably like the ""telescope"" the best because you can actually look through it-it's the one thing that DOES something. The singing on the toy is cute, although it only says a few phrases. Overall, kind of a lame toy."
4,Not as Bad as they are saying,"We got this backpack second hand. It had no batteries or toys inside. We put some small toys inside, and my daughter 'decorated' it with her crayons and stickers. True, it is not a real backpack, and true, the opening is small, but I can easily fit my hand inside to get things out. My daughter is 3 now, and has had it since she was about 2. She has never had a problem opening it, or having it stay closed. It still needs batteries, and she has been asking for new ones for about 6 months. I am reluctant to get them because i anticipate an annoying array of sounds... but overall, this toy has brought her hours and HOURS of pleasure, and she likes to fill it with crayons, a little pad of paper, and a couple of the fisher price little people. Not nearly as bad as everyone is saying!"
1,5.1 Surround Critique,"This review is for the song content only. This is for those who will purchase this 2012 release for the 5.1 Surround treatment of the 5 songs in this film. This is also for those who thought that this would be as great as 1999's Yellow Submarine 5.1 mixes. REAL BAD NEWS HERE! 99% of the rear channel content is mostly reverb. There is almost nothing in the rear channels that is not in the front. The producer for this restoration was none other than Giles Martin (who created the fantastic 5.1 Love soundtrack in 2006). This 5.1 mix is just terrible and a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. However, I will give this 1 star because of the clarity of the mixes and the resulting bits of voices and instruments that you may not have heard in these songs before now."
4,"Not my favorite, but very much enjoyed it","Magical Mystery Tour was conceived by Paul McCartney to lift the Beatles out of their funk after the death of Brian Epstein. Not meant to be a serious movie, more of a fun ride through the country side with cameras. At least they looked like they had a fun time acting in it."
3,Appearance,"Nail Gun works fine in trials, haven't used it extensively yet. Appearance wasn't what I thought it would be based on past purchases of Dewalt refurbished tools. Rather scuffed up."
5,"Tender and charming, one of Gary's better collections.","Like shadow puppets on a curtain which suddenly become real, Soto exposes the pain, humor and glory of being Mexican in California's San Joaquin Valley. From the helplessly funny ""Mexicans Begin Jogging"" to the proud celebration of ""Kearney Park"" Gary Soto shares the poetry of his life.He makes writing poems look so easy, I'm sure could do it"
5,SIDE SPLITTER!!,"A laugh out loud comic strip unlike any other, Wildly Foxtrot again shows us family life in a hilarious way. Also check out the other Anthologys by Bill Amend."
5,"Scott Brannon, music for the soul.","Scott Brannon's music is one I find to be very soothing, I consider it very good for sleeping. Sometimes I might have trouble sleeping because something is on my mind, so I just pop one of Scott Brannon's cd's that I have and start listening. I normally fall asleep in about 5 to 10 minutes. On other occasions when I am frustrated or disturbed I start listening to Scott Brannon's music which starts to calm me down. So, I say if your looking for something to sooth or calm you Scott Brannon is your best choice."
1,Disappointing but cheap....,"I expected a large number of ideas, pictures and details. Nothing here - very disappointing. Easier to just get a few sushi restaurant menus and go from there."
1,"Overpriced, embarrassing, amazon!","To call this a ""book,"" as Amazon does, is VERY misleading. I assumed, from the photo, I would get a decent-sized cookbook, so 5.95 seemed like a good deal. The ""book"" is about the size of a post card. The ""recipes"" are a few words on the page. The descriptions are short, some of the ""recipes"" are downright silly (peanut butter and jelly sushi???). To add insult to injury, the last eight pages are blank pages with lines for the reader to fill in!This is the first time I have encountered an Amazon.com ad that used the power of power of suggestive web pictures to mislead me about a product. In the future, I'll have to be more careful about buying anything on Amazon that is not a name brand item. Too bad."
1,terrible book,"Inadequate to say the least, a terrible book.No pictures, not worth the price.Deceptive, don't bother."
3,Not a bad book - too broad a sweep,"Actually this book contains great visuals.However, I don't see this offering as being of much interest to a juvenile. More likely, this book would attract re-enactors and modellers looking for that extra detail found in real artefacts, not just drawings. The problem would be, of course, the very broad sweep of all military uniforms and paraphernalia, which would reduce any meaningful search for a specific item. The bias here seems to be a focused coverage toward American forces - overkill on the American War of Independence, American Civil War and the Iraqi Conflict."
3,ProArgi 9 Plus,I haven't noticed any difference yet. How long should this take before I notice any difference in my energy level?
4,no title,"Liam Neeson was wonderful to watch - a tragic love story with great winter scenery and lots of cold breath shots. However, Patricia Arquette was too teenage giggly - not a terrific actress in this film, at least. Still, a great role for Neeson."
3,Ethen Frome,I'd seen it before didn't realise it.So didn't bother to watch whole movie donated to a collection in my neighbourhood.
2,It could've been a great movie...,"...If only Patricia Arquette weren't in it. I never had anything against her before I saw this movie, but boy, does she know how to ruin a good movie. Liam Neeson was brilliant, and Joan Allen's performance was good, too, but Arquette's ""acting"" (I use the term loosely) was so overblown, so limp and clumsy and unbelievable, that it ruined the whole film for me; I've seen sixth-graders with better acting skills than I saw out of Arquette in this movie. It's a shame, because the scenes without her in them are brilliant, and the other actors turn in commendable performances. If only they'd hired a more competent actress or paid for some lessons for Arquette."
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES - WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT - WAS WORRIED THE QUALITY MIGHT NOT BE GOODNO NEED TO WORRY, QUALITY,PRICE & DELIVERY GREAT.SATISFIED CUSTOMER"
4,Doctored Live Recording,"I was at this show in 1987. IT was recorded for King Bisquit Flower Hour. Vince Martel was not at this show. Mark Stein remastered this recording. He had Vince overdub guitar and vocals at a later date. Having said this, the band has never sounded better. I wish they had put out the entire show. It was recorded at the Vic Theatre in Chicago. The sound is great except for the overdubbed guitar. There are 3 songs from the Mystery album, the rest are all classics from the sixties. If yor are a fan of this band this is a must have. I bought it from Mark Stein.com for 17.95 . Vinnieodude"
3,It's NOT David Sanborn!,"It's actually Ernie Watts playing the alto sax solo on this version of ""The Seduction."" David Sanborn recorded this tune on his ""Hideaway"" album after the James Last Band version hit the charts. In fact, on earlier pressings of the ""Hideaway"" LP, ""The Seduction"" is not on it. It was added to a later pressing of the album as an afterthought, I suppose..."
5,"Rio and Brigo at their best, captured live!","If you've been to Trinidad during the Carnival season and visited one of the Calypso Tents, then this is definitely a CD for you.Rio delivers a diverse array of selections, some with subtle sexual innuendos, others with biting political commentary.Brigo re-emphasizes his unique beauty with 'Mama Popo' and continues belting out his classics with his roaring, yet stylish demeanor till the very end.The cd is MC'd by none other than the Revue's Dennis ""Sprangalang"" Hall and backed by the competent (quite at that) Frankie Francis. Michael Goodwin gives a very good introduction with included lyrics and liner notes (for dem who doh understan' d' Trini talk).THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE TRINIS!"
1,Birds do not like it in MN,Gave these a shot...they are still half-eaten in our feeder. Birds seem to avoid them. I won't buy them again.
1,Product not described accurately,"These suet cakes were described as *large* suet cakes (12x8x2). What was delivered was the standard small suet cakes, leaving me feeling cheated at this price."
5,great toaster,"This is a great toaster. It toasts evenly, can accomodate a range of thicknesses, has a long cord, is easy to clean. A good toaster is hard to find."
3,It toasts my bread. 'Nuff said,"Only 3 stars because I have to turn the dial almost all the way around to get decent browning. Otherwise, it does exactly what it says on the box."
4,Color is odd but it works fine.,"The Black plastic looks a little odd. It's not glossy like the picture. It doesn't look really clean even after you clean it is the only way I can discribe it. I bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a Pop Tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the Fire Department had to respond. This one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it. Good Idea. But, the instructions still say not to cook Pop Tarts unattended anyway. Now they tell us. There is a toaster with a Pop Tart Logo, the Toastmaster 2035. If you want a laugh, read the review for that one. Bottom line, for the money, this toaster works great. I like the lift feature a lot. But, I'd buy the white next time."
1,"""Ever feel like they just aren't trying anymore?""","I purchased 7 G5 macs for our production dept. 4 of the 7 needed major service, 1 still is in the shop (These were purchased april of 04, so SIX MONTHS and still no running machine that cost 3000.00!)I called Apple today and asked for a new machine. I thought six months of service would be sufficient for this to be granted. I get put on hold, then a tech, who puts me on hold, new tech-reexplaint-on hold....(this goes on for over an hour and a half) Finally I get someone that seems to have a decision: ""Give me your email address and I will send you an email with 'whatever' in a couple days"". (Exact words).Even purchased the 'APPLECARE' Extended service plan--I guess that referres to the e x t e n d e d service I am getting.In closing: Apple = Sux, G5 = Lemon, Applecare = Garbage.Good luck with that Apple. (Applecare Case #42430940)"
5,Possibly the best scented lotion???,"I can't begin to say how amazing this lotion is, I bought it a while ago and each time I use it it transports me from dull grimey everyday London winter to tropical sun and lusciousness! No exageration, this has the best mango scent I've experienced in a body lotion and the body wash is superb too.How typical when looking to buy more it cannot be found! PLEASE stock this again, I want a job lot!!Highly recommended it's like an aromatherapy session in a bottle."
2,Not for a Layman,"I am a layman in opera but still enjoy it and prefer to understand the meaning of each piece of the performance. However, this DVD does not have a subtitle or a description at all. I am totally a dumb in front of the TV."
1,Skip this book,"The ideas aren't very original, and, even worse, they aren't well presented. A lot of the recommendations remain too abstract. The writing is often lazy, and when the authors do choose to offer concrete examples, those often lack impact. I'm not a big fan of self-help books, but the title and description of this one caught my eye, because of the art connection. However, I was very disappointed with the book."
4,Not quite as good as a personal experience,"I experienced Benjamin Zander doing a presentation at a conference a few years ago, and though some of his activities were not my cup of tea, the power of his ideas and more importantly his energy was effective. While the book is not as good as the real thing, it is a lot easier to access!Certainly there are many books of this type, but the message that we become what we think is such a critical message that it needs repeating and reinforcement from a variety of voices."
4,Insightful,"Family therapist Rosamund Stone Zander and symphony conductor Benjamin Zander offer 12 practices for learning to take on an attitude of abundance and possibility. You will enjoy Benjamin Zander's charming anecdotes from his experiences as a distinguished orchestra conductor, as well as the philosophy of family therapist Rosamund Stone Zander whose professional background gives her a deeply insightful viewpoint. Indeed, some of the Zanders' stories are so striking that they will stay with you long after you put the book down. We recommend this book to people who like to explore self-development, story lovers, music aficionados, anyone who has taken on a big commitment and other creative types who will savor the authors' unusual frame of reference."
5,"wonderful, inspirational book","a must read for anyone at all stages of life, but especially those looking to lead - whether they lead from within or lead from the front"
4,Possibility is better than the alternative.,"I would start by reviewing Benjamin Zander videos on You Tube. Then you will understand the man behind the message (or half the message I suppose, since his wife is co writer and she adds good substance to the total message). I first came to this book after seeing Mr. Zander live at a conference and I thought he was fantastic. The book seems a bit harder to get excited about without the video support - in my mind. But overall, as a package, the videos, and then the book are worthwile for the really low cost. I plan to buy some of Mr. Zanders classical music CD's which are also on Amazon. D.W."
1,Very disappointing,"I have to say I'm a bit mystified by all the praise of this book. Despite its claims to the contrary, it offered, in my view, very few ""actionable"" tools or approaches. Repeatedly, I sought to drill down to better understand the authors' concepts and perspectives; too often these were buried under an impenetrable avalance of cliches and platitudes...I mean a LOT of them. I would read a chapter only to be distressed at it's evanescence...I'd like to think that I'm an attentive and engaged reader, but I literally couldn't apply or clearly connect with many of the concepts presented. More disturbingly, some of the cases/examples seem to me to strain credulity and plausibility. The Zanders seem like interesting, winning people, but I'm sorry to say this book added precious little value."
1,Do not buy this awful awful thing,"I was very happy initially, until I realized that the 2 little batteries have to be changed very frequently--as often as every two weeks. Everytime I change the batteries, it loses all of the information and I have to start from scratch and download All of the info all over again. Also sometimes when you change the batteries the screen just freezes up for no reason, and it can take days for it to start working again. My advice is to save your money and hold out for something else--apparently with Palm you get what you pay for."
3,toaster,"After 2 months of use:Average toasting capabilities.Toast ejector extension mechanism great idea, however extension should be leghtened for items such as english muffins. Also, when ejection extension utilized, toast centering grids are disabled and smaller toasting items tend to jam before emerging from the top."
1,WARNING - AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE THESE,"I ordered July 22 - the listing said then as now ""Usually ships within 24 hours"" - it still has not shipped. Multiple emails and phone calls to Amazon have produced nothing but empty promises. They DO NOT have this item in stock."
4,Functional and Stylish,"Great product, stylish and toasts bread just fine. It's not brain surgery folks and for the price you can't go wrong"
5,at last!,"So after my Jeep acting like I had a low battery and I replaced the starter, alt, and battery it turns out it was this silly $35 part... please learn from my $/time spent"
3,"Good info., just severely limited","The manual contains some very good information that is otherwise obscure from the public's view. The main problems are that this information is very limited in the entire substance of the manual which is filled with complicated engineering and demolitions instructions, charts, and diagrams. This information is not pertinent unless someone has the facility and resources to test it out. Likewise, I may not have much familiarity with demolitions, construction, or anything of that nature, but I think that this is more complicated material that only people with expertise would be able to perform. The Rangers Handbook is a much better buy for anyone in terms of overall information, unless that is they are really familiar with, and looking into demolitions and military engineering."
1,Mounting Brackets for Running Board Item #27-6125,"I have purchased this running board and amazed to find that mounting brackets are not included. The item on the web site indicated that brackets are included, but not so. The running boards are designed to fit my vehicle but there are no brackets to fit my particular vehicle. I have a 2007 Jeep Commander. Will be shipping back to Amazon. I also contacted the manufactures web site and cannot find mounting brackets for this item."
1,Fake!!!,Most of this book is made up. The historical parts in are inaccurate. There are many spelling and typografical errors. Not worth the price of the paper it is printed on. Don't waste your money!
3,"Good ""beer and chips"" Star Trek entertainment","Peter Morwood is one of the better ""Star Trek"" novelists, and this one does not disappoint. It features the Klingons, Federation-Klingon politics, and the Organians. Thus, there is a lot here to like.The use of the Organians (see TOS ""Errand of Mercy""), who are an all-powerful race bent on preventing a Federation-Klingon war, always runs the risk of creating a cop-out ending, where things escalate and then the Organians step in, constituting a ""magic bullet"" ending. That is not the case here; more would be telling.This is an entertaining Star Trek novel. Decent characterizations, and interesting insights into the nature of the Klingons. A great afternoon read for the beach or whatnot."
4,"A good read, with well-written characters","I'm not a huge fan of Star Trek novels, but I make an exception for this one. Morwood starts from a funny premise--a Klingon captain whose career was ruined by the tribbles incident spends the next couple of decades plotting his revenge and the restoration of his honor--but the story is actually kind of poignant, as the futility of the Klingon's single-mindedness causes Kirk to reflect on how he has spent his own life. Approaching the ends of their careers, both captains feel to some extent used and abused by their respective governments."
2,Dumb Gimmick,"The only reason I rated this as high as two stars was for Paula Volsky's Lovecraftian take on ""The Giant Rat of Sumatra"". Having writers imitate other famous writers instead of Doyle to do a Holmes story is one of the dumbest gimmicks ever. There are far too many ""hard-boiled"" style stories with dialogue totally unsuited to Holmes and Watson, while the one ascribed to Wells had Holmes spouting Wells' socialist propaganda, which is something even Wells left to secondary characters. The story ascribed to Kerouac is totally unreadable. The rest fall of the stories fall somewhere between these extremes."
3,Could have left out the leftist bias,"Really entertaining. A great book for little stops like the john where you have time for only a few pages at a time. I would have given it a higher rating but for the obvious left wing slant. You know the drill. The bad guys are with Nixon, Reagan, Bush, etc, and are called ""kooky conservatives"" or ""Arch-conservatives."" Meanwhile the leftists are never mentioned as such unless they are outright communists who are then labeled as simply ""left wing."""
4,good,"I admit that I always like reading up on these things. I really liked the lsd suicide section that was talked about in the end of the book, I also liked when they talked about 9/11 theories (nice to see them condemn the theories), also I liked how they talked about the voting issue in the 2000 election. overall a great book for conspiracy buffs. the only thing wrong with it was the references to the show ""The X Files,"" the show been cancelled for a long time lose the references, also they talked about the alien autopsy, although the said that is probably fake it has been recently proven fake, lose the chapter. Also I would like it if they updated more sections of the book. In the end this is a great book to read if you like reading this sort of thing."
2,Other similar books provide much more for the money,"I ordered this book, hoping that it would provide a simple but substantive approach to identifying customers and developing strategies to reach them. Instead, I was disappointed to discover that it was merely a compilation of worksheets with no explanation as to how to use them. Many of the questions were open-ended with no real structure that would lead to a coherent strategy.The ""One-to-One Fieldbook"" by Don Peppers and Martha Rogers is a much more useful handbook, and at $15.95 is a much more worthwhile investment. I'm returning my copy of this book and keeping the Peppers and Rogers tome."
4,Good but not update for building with laser levels.,In general this book seems to be pretty good. The only complaint I have is that laser levels are wonderful tools and really obsolete a lot of the other leveling techniques. This book does not cover using a laser level at all.
3,"It is well made, BUT","This is a really heavy weight sleeved bib, so if you live in warmer climate, it is not going to be very comfortable for the child. I live in So. California, even with the AC on during summer, with room temp controlled at 72/73 or below, it is still way too warm for my little girl to wear it. But I think it will be great for finger painting in the winter, not for eating."
2,Eh....,"I really enjoyed the majority of this book. My biggest problem was the end, I absolutely hate endings like this one. I'm usually a believer of 'meeting your soul mate in another life' idea but *SPOILER* when you kill off the hero and give the heroine another man who is supposedly his reincarnate and just expect me to except it when there has been ZERO character development of the new one (who is introduced in like the last 5 pages) then you have another thing coming. The book was totally working for me and I was so excited to find the end this was a major let down."
4,Familiar ground,"This book covers ground familiar to sea-story readers, but does it with an interesting twist. The ship is imaginary, but typical, with the events of a routine day covered from a to z (or 4 AM to 4 AM). It is well done, and will be of particular interest to beginners in the field."
5,What an impact,"In junior high Mr. Spanjaard came and spoke at my school. Afterwards I read his book. What an impact it made on me. It tought me compasion for the human race, not a paticular race. Now 12 years later I can not wait to read this book again."
5,Sophisticated easy recipes!,"I really like this slow cooker cookbook. It's easy and has a variety of recipes that are healthy and low in fat. Nutritional analysis is provided for each recipe. There are a lot of creative recipes, not just your usual slow cooker fare. There are also a lot of beautiful photographs. This book is better than a lot of other slow cooker books I've seen. I'm sure there is something for everyone in this book!"
2,Flawed,"First of all, it took 30 days to receive this (shipped from ""Summer Rain"" in China), from the time I ordered it. I ordered an identical one, except in clear, not blue, from a USA seller (Luos Cultural Goods) and rec'd it in less than a week.Second, it has a large (about 1/4"") flaw on one side, which is VERY noticeable and makes it unusable as a gift. It's not worth returning, so I will try to polish the flaw down with a dremel tool and just live with it. Very disappointed.Other than the flaw, it is very pretty."
2,"Nice, but....","While I do like the crystal, it is NOT AT ALL the color shown in the sell pic. Not sure what to think, but I really do not want to go through the hassle to send them back and begin the search again. If you order these, you really must intend to receive a VERY DARK BLUE crystal, so dark, in fact, that almost no light could get through. Just a warning."
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my baby when he was a month old. He is now 4 months old and loves it. I have never had to change the batteries yet. He doesnt pay much attention to the lights or movement so I just have it set to play the music and sounds. He is impossible to get to sleep without it. Even if I am staying somewhere else with him, this is a must pack! With it I can feed him, bathe him, and lay him down, push the button and leave the room. I rarely have to go back in and start it again he falls asleep to it so quickly. I only hope when he gets old enough to activate it himself that he doesnt stay awake just to watch it."
3,Too bright for middle of the night wakings,"My 5 month old and my 2 1/2 year old love to watch this, which is why it is a shame I have to return this. I wanted something for when she wakes up in the middle of the night and this is just way to bright. This would be perfect if they had way to control the brightness."
4,Great crib addition,"I got this when my baby was 3 months old because a friend said it always put her son to sleep. Two months later, while it doesn't put her to sleep, it does keep her quiet when she wakes up early and I want another hour of sleep. Also, she likes to look at it when I put her in the crib because I have things to do and can't keep an eye on her. There really are no negatives to this."
4,"WHEN UNPACKAGING, DON'T CUT THE GREEN STRAPS!!!","Don't do what I did. When you take this out of the box and begin unpacking there will be two green straps that you will naturally mistake as some fastener holding the product in the box. It isn't. It's the straps that hold the device to the crib. After cutting one of mine I wound up needing to fabricate one of my own(PAIN!). What is it with the way stuff is packaged these days?? Do packaging engineers get off frustrating purchasers of their products who want to just simply open a box and use it??? O.K., rant off... I've only had this soother for a couple weeks, but so far I love it. The thing I like most is the colors; they're very rich and vivid. The music isn't bad(won't drive you nuts) and the movement of the animals is smooth. Battery life is O.K. so far(haven't needed replacement). All-in-all, short of the packaging, I would say this is a well assembled, well designed, quality item."
5,Excellent,"Jim Berg does an excellent job of helping us to understand the nature of sanctification, the process of God changing us to be like His Son. This is the study book for his book ""Changed into His Image"""
5,Great Blade,"This blade works great for what I need it to do. I don't know much about saws and blades, but I have no complaints."
4,Onkyo TX-8222 50 Watt Stereo Receiver,"It's black, electronic, belongs to my wife, and it works. When my wife cranks up her crappy music on it, she smiles. What else could I ask?"
2,"Very harsh, shrill sound","I purchased a shelf model of the Onkyo TX-8222. It's possible that I got a lemon. But I hooked it up with the same cables and with the same speakers (Bose 301) which sounded great with an Onkyo TX-906. I understand that a 50wpc receiver cannot sound as smooth as an 85wpc receiver. However, I was not prepared for the harshness that I experienced! It seemed that the sine waves were getting clipped even at very low volumes! Very shrill, metallic, and cold sound. Never tried it at loud volumes as it was too bad at medium settings. BTW, I broke in the receiver 24 hours/day for 3 weeks before I decided it was horrible. Maybe I got a lemon?"
3,overall good,"I cooked more than 20 recipes from this book and most of them turned well. If you want novel tasting vegetarian recipes buy this book. However if you do not like garlic + olive oil + lemon + salt dressing stay away. The instructions are sometimes incomplete and there are lots of duplicate recipes. However, they end up tasting good."
4,Great Game,"I didn't think this would be nearly as fun as it is. The game looks like it is running on technology from the mid 90s, and makes a person wonder how it is still so popular. When my brother finally got me to try it, I couldn't put it down. The game really is awesome.Anyhow, my biggest gripe is that the game is actually too popular. Like someone else already said, it is overpopulated with people's houses. Every clearing in every forest, every shoreline -- every place where housing is possible, there is housing. This leaves hardly any room for new ones. Expect to start with a very small house and work your way up the ladder as you find better places."
3,This game is out dated!,"This was one of the first MMORPG's to come out and it truly was groundbreaking. However, this game is so ancient it may as well be in a dungeon somewhere guarded by a dragon. There are so many other games out there now that we doubt if the public still maintains interest in this game. We wouldn't recommend a purchase unless you're limited to a low end computer."
3,This BBQ needs bolts and nuts from hardware store,"Amazingly, this very sturdy BBQ came with a near-wordless diagram for assembly with some image errors (I had to download an earlier version from the 'Net) and worse: the assembly diagram and package of bolts directed customers to assemble key structural frame components with a) bolts too short for secure fastening, and b) NO NUTS, and c) minimal washers. True, a few nuts were designed and provided for OTHER parts - but this BBQ as I unpacked it from the Weber box was very frustrating until I made three (3) trips to the hardware store to replace the short bolts and get fistfuls of nuts and washers. Well - it's been raining since we assembled the BBQ. It seems to work fine simply burning some propane, and I believe it will be a great BBQ when the sun comes out. What were these BBQ engineers thinking of? Saving a few pennies?"
5,Very Nice,"First of all, I didn't buy my Weber on Amazon, but since a lot of people look to Amazon for reviews, I decided to post my experience.The grill I bought was the EP-320 which differs from the E-320 only by using stainless steel grates and stainless flavorizor bars instead of porcelain coated steel.The grill is easy to put together but step one on the instructions was printed wrong and after calling Weber was told two parts had to be reversed. Other than that, it went together smoothly in about 2 hours. The Weber Genesis grill is still made by Weber in the USA, which was important to me.The grill has functioned great and cooks very evenly. It is built well, looks great and does what it is supposed to. I am very happy with it."
3,Pretty good.,Have only used the Hot Pot so far. Ceramic bowl looks nice on the table. Holds plenty. Magnetic safety cord is a very good feature.Heat control is rubbish though. Is either on or off - doesn't really seem to be any inbetween. Perhaps we got a dud.
4,Decent underwear,This underwear used to be my favorite until I found a better style and price from 2(x)ist.
1,Worst money spent in a long time,"To say this movie was horrible would be a compliment. Mystery Science Theater wouldn't even touch this one. Acting was bad, story was even worse. Kept watching it in hopes something would happen. I'm a huge fan of horror and even ""b"" grade movies, but this was way below par.Keep your money. I wish I had."
5,Absolutely Awsome!!!,"This is the one album that you just have to have. If you like funk, then you'll love this album. Check it out!"
2,Great doll but...,My daughter received this doll for Christmas last year (2009).She was thrilled to get her and loved her and her accessories. However the doll is not at all durable. My daughter hadn't had her for a month when the torso and legs came apart. She was disappointed and although she still uses the accessories poor Veterinarian Laura lays at the bottom of the toy box. Breyer needs to make the dolls more durable.
4,"Rather costly...but to a fan, I guess it's worth it!","Fortunately, I bought my copy in its glorious VINYL form.Two of Miss Ross's staples are here: ""The Theme from Mahogany"" and ""Love Hangover"". The former is one of her best ballads while the latter is one of the seminal dance tracks of the disco '70's.Overall, not among the diva's best, but it's still an essential of her discography."
3,Great for collectors,"I have been wanting this set for a long time and I finally got it! I am a collector of Breyers and this horse really caught my eye. His pose is wonderful and his tail is beautiful. He is so unique because of his hunter ""clip"" that looks flashy! I admire all Breyers for being so realistic, but this one takes the cake. This horse looks great modeling on my shelf.However, his pose might make him a little difficult for children to play with. The fox and the dog are an appropriate addition, but I can't find much to do with them. (Although I'm sure kids would like them more)This horse is so handsome. He is a good addition to any collection and I think he is worth the price."
3,"Elevator music, lots of influence from Phil Coulter","With the piano being the main instrument, there should be less need for the synthesizer. Easy listening, very pleasant elevator or telephone music. Phil Coulter is credited, but it sounds too much like his work, and has nothing distinguishing. The front cover picture takes away totally from the general ambience of the music, and one might wonder if the CD is promoting wonderbras or music."
4,A Basic Knot Book Delivers,"I purchased the Klutz Book of Knots as a Christmas gift for my 9-year-old daughter. I felt that a basic knowledge of knots might make her more confident, particularly with shoe tying. The book is comprehensive, and the built-in practice cords are useful. After a little struggle, my daughter was tying many of the knots quite handily. She found the book intriguing, at least for a few hours.All in all, I think the book presents the basic camping and nautical knots in a simple and non-threatening way. I think it is suitable for a child, or for anyone seeking a basic knowledge of knots."
4,Safe Cas Review,"Nintendo DS Lite Safe Casethis case is a great little case, Intec fixed the problem with the latch mechanism on this case compared to the older version. and it holds the DS lite snug but not overly tight like some of the mesh cases likeNintendo DS Lite Carry Case, it holds about four games in one of the two mesh pockets, the hinge is a little funky, it will not shut if you are pulling up on the lid. but other than this little quark it is a great case and i love it."
3,Works as advertised but directions need major editing.,"I installed the Dust Monkey on a Jet contractor saw and I am satisfied with the finished product. That said, the directions provided with the kit are ponderous, confusing and in some cases not that well thought out. I totally ignored the directions for installing the hopper on the bottom of my saw. The directions for cutting the back panel and the foam ramps are convoluted (especially considering that it's all pretty simple). The manufacturer would do well to hire a technical writer and use illustrations (a picture is worth .... ). If you are mechanically inclined you can figure out how to install the Dust Monkey on your saw but take some time to study your saw, the parts at hand and the directions (with a suspicious eye).Once you get done with the installation you'll be pleased with the performance of the product."
5,winter guitar,"wonderful cd, great soothing music. Mr. Juber is an amazing guitarist. Cd is in really good condition. No problems at all"
1,piece of junk,"Buy this item if you want to make curved cuts otherwise you would get a straighter cut freehand. The guide seems nice but bows at the joint when cutting. Save your money, buy a better guide. The old addage - you get what you pay for. I should have known better."
1,not that good,"Mr. Connelly's self-professed ""research"" was all of 3 weeks, and it shows. The stories do not reflect the wealth of stories at Philmont. Additionally, when did Penitentes give up their centuries old legacy of Hispanic heritage and become Native Americans? Too many errors and slipshod production make this book one not worth having.There's a far better volume published in 2003 by a former staff member."
5,Ten Black Dots,I bought this book as it was suggested in the kindergarten common core math curriculum to introduce the fact that 10 can be represented in different arrays and still represents the number 10. The children liked it and we counted 10 in each picture. After we read it they used bingo markers to make their own picture using 10. Lots of fun.I would highly recommend this to other kindergarten teachers.
3,good for color coding.,Needed some black. My fault. I really needed more subtle colors for my stage application. Black is always best for stage. The lights pick up everything....
2,Had to send in twice for repair,"While I am happy with the performance of this camera, I have had to return it twice for repairs within 6 months of purchase. First the Auto focus had to be adjusted and recalibrated within a month of purchase, then I recently had to return it because the mode selection dial stopped working. I am a bit afraid that this camera will need to be replaced as soon as the warranty runs out..."
2,terrible picture quality,"My Dad owned an older Kodak with the same lense, and it took good pictures, but this camera takes very grainy and fuzzy picutres. It is incapable of taking an indoor picture without the flash, and even with the flash the indoor photos (except for closeups) are fuzzy. Even high light outdoor photos were often fuzzy. I returned this after a week and now an looking to get either a fuji s700, kodak s3 is, or a panasonic fz8, but I don't want to be this dissapointed again"
2,Noises of using the zoom lens and when turning on,"When turning on this Z612 6.1 MP Digital Camera, it sounds a slight ""Da-Da-Da..."" noise. I suppose this is due to the automatic focusing function that is endurable. But when I took the video recording, the noise was clearly recorded by the camera. This seems abnormal. I don't know how to abate the noise.Thanks,Jiang Dong"
5,Magnificent Little Gem of a Book,"This book is (slightly shamefully) one of the most-often referenced books that I own. It's so much fun to read a summarized version of your friends' and family members' (and potential boyfriends', haha) personalities, and from what I've found, it's actually pretty darn accurate! Accurate or not, it's fun to read, it's elegant, and fits in the palm of your hand. A fun, inexpensive birthday gift!"
5,Apple picking made easy,I got this for my parents and they loved how easy it worked picking their apple trees.
2,Variable quality,"Bought an earlier version of this ~12 years ago which stood up to the rigors of international business travel for many years until one of the zips failed. This bag is very similar in design with very similar features. Overall the quality of the leather etc is good but the stitching on one of the carry handles is poor where it attaches to the bag. Since I rely on the carry strap its not a big deal, but seems in strange contrast to the rest of the quality of the bag."
5,Mercy!,"And I cannot believe I am only the second! This CD is simply stunning -- I've listened to finger-picking all my life, and I've never heard ANYTHING to compare with this -- Preston Reed is a class of one!"
3,"So,So","I generally like books writen about the south, but found this one to be slow moving. I usually keep my books and read them many times as I always get something I missed the first time. Unfortunately, this is one that is going to Goodwill after the first reading."
3,Everyone is worth a story.,"Isn't that the truth. This book is overall a very good book. I loved the small town life and people fighting for what they believe in. I however had trouble with the views of no God and the relationships seemed shallow. It seems Ruth just drifts from place to place, not really giving anyone a chance to know her. She invents herself completely different from who she really is. That isn't getting to know people really.I have trouble with no real love just people shacking up with this person and that person. Maybe I am just not the person to read a book that rambles or has more literal meanings. Maybe they went way over my head. Whatever way, I would still read more by this author, I think!"
3,A Small town book,"This book is about a young, small-town girl, Ruth, in the 70's who ""got-out-of town"" by marrying the first guy who offered to take her away. When that marriage ended soon after, she travels to a new town and finds an older woman, Rose who gives her what she is looking for in a mother-figure. The book takes place over a year, but fails to develop any plot line other that the friendship/mother-figure relationship between the two women.Overall an easy and quick read. You might identify with it if you are from a small town."
5,A reply to crummy-udgeon and snitty,"Crummyudgeon, I just want to reassure you that I am not just jumping on the bandwagon- I generally don't like the number one hits, and I haven't bought a CD in ages. But crazy frog deserves to be number one. It is so different from the other songs out there- it's not just obscene lyrics and people dancing. It's a little frog on an air motorcycle- music videos don't get much better than that! I realize that cell phone tones are really, really annoying, but by combining it with the 80s hit and the music video, AxelF has hit the jackpot. If you have seen the video, you might have noticed that it is supposed to be somewhat annoying. (The screen reads ""Wanted: the most annoying thing in the world."") The music video never fails to make me laugh. After discovering it during a vacation on Europe, I can't wait to share it with everyone I know."
1,Very disappointed,Bought this for my 10 year son who is a big K'nex fan. It was very difficult to assemble. The weight of the platform caused it to collapse during construction. Once we finally completed it it was difficult to play with as every other flip of the flipper caused it to collapse again and again. I was so dissapointed in this product that I actually returned it.
1,not so sure,"My son bought this with his own money. He is just turnig 10. He was very disapointed with this toy. During the construction of this toy a piece broke in the back, which is not replaceable. This was very frustrating."
2,A HUGE step down from the first Nightmare,"""Freddy's Revenge"" is easily the weakest film in the Nightmare franchise. It feels out of place most of the time and the plot is just downright ridiculous. There is one scene in it (that for me) will go down as one of the most perplexing scenes in movie history. When Jesse sneaks out of the house and wanders to some crazy S&M; bar and sees his P.E. teacher decked out like some leather daddy. For some bizarre reason the coach takes Jesse to their school and makes him run laps in the gym. The teacher then gets murdered by a bunch of tennis rackets and basketballs.I can't reccomend this movie to you unless you are (a) a die-hard Freddy fan, and even then you're bound to be dissapointed, or (b) if you're a completist and you want to get this to fill the gap in your collection. All-in-all ""Freddy's Revenge is a big dissapointment.Grade: D"
1,What a gip...,"I purchased this product and expected a full sized set of cards (i.e., one of the card boxes from prior sets). The set of card was approximately 2 inches thick although the box was much larger. I then did the math - 1,000 questions comes out to about 170 cards. The box is deceptive and this is not a good value."
3,Hooded Cat Pan,"A little smaller than what I expected, but functional. I'd ultimately like to teach both of my cats to use the toilet so I won't ever have to buy litter again. All in all, it's a cat pan!"
5,A wonderful story for children with an environmental message,I remember this book from my own childhood and its message has never left me: take care of some space for the animals to live. The story has great characters and the illustrations are wonderful. The animal's journey from their doomed home to a new one is well worth sharing with your child.
4,Great swing,I purchased this swing about a year ago. My 4 year old son loves it. Unfortunately the cushion is ripped by the sawing line and it is losing the small plastic cylinder filling. It is perfect for our toy room so I am considering buying another one however a bit disappointed by the quality considering the price. We take care of our toys.
1,have owned 2. both have come apart,we have owned 2 of these (haba sent us a replacement after the first one broke). its a very comfortable swing but the stitching simply does not hold us to heavy use.
3,Great swing if you bring it in in the winter,"We put this on our outdoor swingset and the kids (and me) love it! It doesn't get hot when the sun is beating down outside like the plastic seats do. Unfortunately, it deteriorated and broke while my daugter was swinging...bring it in during the winter months and maybe it will last longer."
1,BEWARE!!!,"I am just amazed that this listing is still on Amazon! About three years ago I bought it in anticipation of it being the original LIVE broadcast (which is how it was and still is advertised). Actually, it is just a copy of the Decca STUDIO set! I complained to Amazon and it was withdrawn...but, just browsing, I find it here again! DO NOT BUY THIS SET UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."
3,DARK METAL WITH ATMOSPHERE,"This band is great all around from fast-drumming,good metal vocals,and decent guitar solos. This CD has all that and more. I finally purchased their CD ...AND SO THE NIGHT BECAME and was pretty impressed. This is not black metal,its not death metal,its what the band calls dark metal,so this release defiantly offers something different which is nice for a change. THIS CD IS GOOD STUFF."
1,Worst Juicer I've Ever Had,This juicer is a complete and utter waste of money. Do not believe the hype! I've gone through a few juicers in over 15 years. I've never seen one like this.So much vegetables and fruit are wasted. Most of what you're trying to juice ends up in the pulp collector. No wonder they keep going on in their manual and DVD with recipes and ideas as to what to do with your pulp! They give all these recipes for muffins and breads ... but that's not my reason for buying a juicer! I bought it to buy juice. Not to bake muffins! I have never ever seen such little juice come out of a bag of carrots. Unbelievable.Installing it is a pain.Cleaning it is even worse.I wish I'd kept my box so that I could return this.Amazon should honestly consider not carrying this.
2,Juice this!,The commercial is a complete scam! It barely juices carrots!! Plus if you don't buy the plastic base for another $30 you can barely get a glass under it. Really not happy... I DO NOT RECOMMED IT TO ANYBODY
4,Here are my answers and thoughts,"as far as the other juicer was returned. The watch and magnatab are Christmas gifts I deliver to them. Notsure if my grandson has one of those watches. Won't know about those 2 until after Christmas....OKSofar I am pleased with the Jack Lalannes juicer, have to use it longer to know it I love it????"
2,Juicer,"I received a faulty product. What a faux pas, as I ordered both this more expensive model and the less expensive one, which works just fine! Go figure..."
3,JLSSPJD,"I have found the unit to do a good job juicing, but if you are an aggresive juicer; i.e., daily, expect to replace the cutting blades every six months @ $30. You will know when - the unit bogs down when fed vegetables. This unit has a stainless spout, but the juice collection chamber is plastic. It should have been engineered with a stainless juice collection chamber instead of plastic. It is manufactured in China, so who knows what plastic chemicals mix with the juice."
4,I love my juicer,"I love my juicer, but I hate taking it all apart to clean after each use.I was watching the info-mercial yesterday & it said the pulp comes out minimul & bone dry. Mine does not do that. I have a lot of wet pulp. It also said that the skin & stems would be chopped up into juice & mine come out in the pulp container.For the most part I love it though. It is very easy to use & the juice is great."
4,great,"I love this juicer. It is quiet, fast, never gets clogged, easy to clean, and makes alot of juice. I use the pulp in my composte, and it does what it says. I am sure there are even better juicers on the market for hard core juicers, but for my first juicer,this was the perfect one for us. I have no regrets! Love it!"
1,Juice on the counter,"Depends on what you are jucing. If you are jucing strawberries, you have to stop and clean the tray inside after 10 or 11 berries, or you too will have strawberry juice all over your counter."
4,Good juicer,"The only thing I found better in this unit than it's older model is that the food insertion hole is bigger. That is great for apples & such, but not good for carrots. The Carrots slide around & jump up & down, making it hard to get them juiced.Clean up requires its wrench for the cutter area, but is easy to clean once apart.It culls out all the bad stuff very well. Good juicer!"
1,Juice in the Pulp,"According to the commercial, the pulp is supposed to be dry. I used this item once and I was able to extract more juice from the pulp. Don't waste your money. I wish I didn't. I ordered direct from the company and I was told that would have to pay for the shipping for the return and would not be refunded the $30 already charged for the shipping. Their customer service is horrible too."
5,Thank you Steve Cropper,"Well I must admit before Steve Cropper released Dedicated, I had never heard of the 5 Royales, a regional mid-Southern powerhouse who had a productive 15 year career and nary a national hit. They are quite simply amazing! Lowman Pauling, their guitarist, is quite simply incredible--the lead singer Johnny Tanner is astonishing in his rough but sweet voice. And the songs! Such great songs! This is the Stax sound, the James Brown sound, in embryo, amazing and crucial music. Not only is it is historically interesting, it is really great music fun and finger popping.So Thank you Steve Cropper--you introduced me to a great great soul group. Crank this music, crank it baby.I also agree with the other review--the Ace production here is exceptional. This is a very nice CD set."
4,50's vocal gem with cool guitar,the missing link from 50's rnb and 60's soul not least being guitarist lowman pauling's influence on stax records guitarist steve cropper.the vocals obviously are great too.
5,Excelent - she touches on themes of our times,"Great album, check out track 3 - ""If it were up to me"", highly poignant during these times. I highly recomend it."
5,"Thank you, Cheryl!","I bought this album several months ago and really love it. At first listening I would have called it a 3.5 or 4-star album: the production is a tad heavy in places, and Cheryl's voice is smoother and less gritty than in her live performances (aside from the two live tracks). But unexpectedly, this album grew on me in a big way. Cheryl's lyrics are deceptively simple and so insightful about the small pleasures in life. His Hometown and Lighting Up The Mighty Mississippi in particular I find just incredibly moving--I feel like they'll be with me a long time. I guess I can understand why other reviews rated this album lower--a couple of tracks are weaker than the standouts--but every review is personal, and I can only say that Cheryl Wheeler has touched me personally with this album. If you are a fan of wistful, beautiful singer-songwriter music, you just may feel the same way. Five stars, at least."
4,DON'T FORGET TO FLIP THE SWITCH!,"Just wanted to say that my daughetr LOEVS this doll and plays with it much more than the other ""non-singing"" Hannah dolls she has.. and a NOTE to the PREVIOUS REVIEWER who stated ""hearing the same few bars of an over-played song over & over is annoying"" DID YOU FLIP THE SWITCH INSIDE HER?? Most toys now-a-days come with a switch inside with 3 settings DEMO,OFF,PLAY ... When you get the toy it is in DEMO MODE so that when people test it out int he store it only plays a small part of the song so the Batteries won't be worn out for hte person who actually BUYS it and takes it home... THis is ALSO true for these Hannah Dolls... Flip her switch to PLAY/ON and she will sing the WHOLE SONG for your child...*And... of course it might still seem repetitious after a while BUT it SURE beats that FISHER-PRICE RECORD PLAYER we had when WE were kids that OUR Moms had to endure!! LOL"
4,My 10 y.o. daughter really enjoyed this doll.,"My daughter loves everything Hannah Montana, and this doll is no exception. The doll is high quality and a reasonable likeness of the Disney mega super duper star. The doll plays a bit of Hannah's hit, which is not so loud as to be totally annoying in the next room. As fashion dolls go, this one's pretty good."
2,Interesting book but can't buy the propaganda,"Of course Mr. Press views the abortion industry as an honorable profession. This book is an extremely biased justification of a horrible ""procedure"". I actually couldn't even finish the book."
4,"Hey, are you OKAY in there?","Hubby is a movie man. I asked him what good books he's read in his life, and then I proceeded to read both of them.Enter The Bathroom Reader. This edition was his first, and after an hour in said room, I sheepishly knocked to ask if he was ""Okay in there"".Four editions later and I asked him to make a bookshelf.Guests emerge amused and comforted, wondering where they can get these great books. Full of history, trivia, lists, mental puzzles, quotations, helpful facts and MUCH more, there is literally something for everyone. Open it to any random page and you'll find something worth knowing during your privy time.Lots of fun to be had in what has become one of the more interesting rooms in the house.This book and others in the series make wonderful gifts for ANYONE on your list for whom you can find NOTHING they would want. They want this. Trust me."
5,Four thumbs up!!!,"This gun is the best gun in the world. I shot my friend from like 40 yards away and hit him square in the forhead! I reccommend getting this gun over anything. If your looking for a gun get this one you won't be dissapointed! Don't look at any other gun.. look at this one. Im really serious! If your rusty after a little time off of Airsoft, get this gun it'll prove that your still on top of the game!!! 10 out of 5 stars from me!"
4,It was a good gun,"I will start out by saying that this gun is not for expirienced players. This gun is good for me because im not an intense player. If you use 12g bb it will shot about how far a spring pistol does, but if you use a 24g bb it wail shoot 215fps. i use 12g bb. if you play in a backyard then this is a gun to get."
2,works poorly,The gun does not work properly it miss fires most of the time and then jams .Very sorry I purchased this for my grandson. Would not recommend anyone else purchase this one try something else.
3,I feel enlightened but not convinced...,"Lots of interesting information. I bought the book because I became curious about this particular topic. And I do feel that I have learned something - but I'm not conviced that it's 100% rock-solid fact.The author's writing rambles a bit. And he tried to fill in gaps in evidence and fact with personal statements.I'm currently reading ""The Real Meaning of the Zodiac"" (D. James Kennedy) It's a little easier to read.The author's writing style in ""The Heavens Declare"" does not make for an enjoyable read."
5,New way to understand Gods planns,"I will never look at the stars with the same old eyes again, it tells such a wonderful story of God and his creations and his first comming and of Yshuas second comming. Wonderful book, a little hard to read but so informative."
5,Excellent book,"Read through it in less than a day. Storyline is always on track, and good characters as well(wb Zayl & Humbart)."
3,Beach Boys,"I was disappointed with this DVD as I thought it would be their Doin it Again Concert, rather than a documentary type DVD"
4,Nostalgic DVD,"Having just seen the ""reunited"" Beach Boys show last May, was disappointed, but not surprised no video was allowed. This DVD with a 42 inch HDTV and good sound system is the next best thing to being there, which for three hours I actually was.."
4,"Milwaukee 6-1/2"" 40T Saw Blade","There aren't a lot of finish blades available for cordless 6-1/2"" circular saws. Found this one at Amazon. It arrvied very quickly. This blades makes nice smooth finish cuts. I'd definitely buy it again."
3,"Nice, but. . . .","i bought this for my son's nursery. it looks great on the crib, and it does complete the camp snoopy collection. the only problem with the item is the music, it's powered by winding action. the music plays for a very brief period of time, doesn't even seem to last 5 minutes. there is a possibility that i received a defective item, but i haven't even seen anyone else review the product, so i can't say whether or not the brief music playing time is the norm. for completing the nursery setup, a+, but for function - as far as soothing music playing goes, maybe a c-."
5,Ultimate Team Strategy Game,"4 player Stratego. WOW.Cons- It is hard to get 4 people to play, it does take a long time, the pieces are hard to see, and u have to do a little bendy trick to get the cardboard to stay inside the pieces.Pros- Best strategy board game ever. I have had some intense 2 hour games. The 4 player mode is the way to go and it is very very intense. It makes up for any downfall. If you can get 4 intelligent people into a room together to player this game I promise it won't be your last, but if you only played it once it would still be worth it.I'm surprised this game has remained as reclusive as it is. It's much better than counterparts like risk, or other war games. There is another European version which looks more accomodating, ""Stratego 4"" which is a 2,3, or 4 player game.**If you have 4 people who strategy, and are looking for an intelligent, intense 2 hours, you've found it."
3,With a little Elmer's Glue...this'll be a great game.,"As the other reviewers have stated, this version of the classic game contains expanded rules that will accomodate 4 players in addition to some other interesting 2-player scenarios. The games comes with a two-sided playing board to allow for its alternate rules.However, where this game falls short is in its construction. The playing pieces are nothing more than plastic moldings that house carboard insertsdepicting the rank of the piece. After a short time, the cardboard inserts begin to drop out of their casings. I find myself reinserting the pieces more than I do setting up the game itself. Major pain -- and without question a game-breaker for me. I now play the original version with the painted pieces as this version collects dust on my shelf."
3,Batman Camera,"This was a gift for my nephew, and I haven't heard work back if he liked it or not. I'm gonna guess not, otherwise I would have heard how much he loved it."
5,AMAZING,"This product is AMAZING! You could buy all the seasons separate and call it the ""Complete Series"" but, this right here is the ""COMPLETE SERIES""! Yet, there are still some slight problems, my tin case had a slight dent in it, but, it's not very visible and it doesn't really matter to me. And, there are a few mistakes in the booklet that lists the episodes on a disc. Overall, it's a great show, fun for the whole family and great packaging!"
5,What's Not To love?,Anyone who is looking at the possibity of buying a Carol burnett lp/cd knows just what they are buying. and what's not to love? This lp released in her hay day covers songs that are still loved today and done in burnett style. Carol Burnett is a national treasure and I am pleased they chose to release this cd.
3,Secrets Come Out Late,"The Spanish session of the European Book Club selected this book so it was sort of a required read for me. It was an OK read with ""secrets"" coming out in the final 20 or so pages. But what made it for me, and sadly not many other readers will have this opportunity unless they research the period themselves, the moderator, a Spanish Lit Professor, put the events in the story into a timeline of historical events of the modern history of Spain. His doing this helped us understand references we would not have picked up. The premise of the European Book Club is to introduce American readers to foreign authors by reading translations of works and to educate and introduce us to each session's country. This is the 4th year and we have learned so much. Especially that unlike much of our American ""stories"" most European literature has very strong themes or undertones that dissect issues of politics, ecology or immigration in the particular country."
1,SHAM--Do not deal with this vendor.,"I ordered a supposed poster from this company and received a PHOTOCOPY. I am shocked. The price was very low, yes, but I think this company is counting on a consumer who won't go through the trouble of trying to get his money back or of returning the item. I repeat: I tried to order a poster of Emerson to put up in my classroom and received a poor quality PHOTOCOPY. Do not order anything from this company. I would have given it ZERO stars but that rating is not possible."
3,"Glossy, punky rock-n-roll","This cd is cool, a bit glossy on the production side, but still cool. It has a raw feel (performance wise), and the singer's voice is really punk-like, but the band has a more of a classic hard rock sound, with touches of punk and pop thrown in. ""Live 4 the Weekend"" rocks, but ""Angeline"" is a true guilty pleasure. With its heartfelt lyrics and the singer's earnest delivery, ""Angeline"" is worth the purchase of the cd alone. It's that good."
5,Excellent!,"Unfortunately short story collections too often seem the bastardized relatives of novels and I so seldom see them appear on any award or reading lists. Murakami's The Elephant Vanishes is a prime example of how perfect and well crafted short stories can be. His stories tend to follow the lives of the upper/middle class and a certain emotional distance or ambiguity and here and there an element will connect one story with a previous story. This perhaps was the first book that I couldn't wait to finish because I was so exhilarated to read it again. My favorite story in the collection (read it even if it's only in passing): ""The Second Bakery Attack."""
4,Noboro Watanabe,"Murakami's short stories all share a mood of serene surrealism, sort of like a Jeunet movie. Perhaps surprisingly the stories seem less ""Japanese"" (aside from their Tokyo backdrops) than those of several ex-pats, including Kerri Sakamoto who lives in Toronto. Some of the stories are a little self-consciously quirky (the Jonathan Lethem disease) and none of them really implant any long-term images in the reader's mind. They tend to evaporate into insubstantiality the minute you finish reading them.Still, they have the pleasant mouth-feel of a high-quality Riesling."
4,The plot thickens.... then ?,"I loved reading these stories, but most of them ended in a way that just left me wanting some explanations. I am not sure if I will go on to read any of his novels because of that."
3,Watchable,Decent fun made better by Bruce. SURROGATES is a decent movie that is largely unorginal but fun to watch. The point of the movie is solid and Bruce shows us that he is still a great action star. Enjoy.
2,Who needs Botox?,"There's a generally underwhelming tone to SURROGATES. Although far from being a bad movie it never really engages or realises its potential. It's a predictable slice of dystopian cop schlock lifted only by some neat set pieces and a nuanced performance from Rosamund Pike (as Willis's grief-stricken wife). There's the nugget of an interesting movie here but the concept of living through a surrogate isn't given the attention it deserves, and what we get instead is the usual action romp we've come to expect from Willis, who is, in fact, capable of more. Watchable but a missed opportunity."
2,"Complex SciFi w/o a ""carring story""","All I will say is ""Surrogates"" had Bruce Willis in a part as a FBI agent where he did not shine. Bruce was good but the character he played lacked something. Read others in depth reports but keep in mind, this movie dragged on and on with too many big scenes to close together. This was akin to iRobot in many ways and I wonder how they are going to distroy the Billions of dead Clones when the REAL HUMANS have not worked for many years."
2,Too Much Used Material and too little originality,"So that I won't be lynched by rabid Bruce Willis fans, I actually like most of his films and this film is OK. However, and it is a big however, the storyline appears to be a mixing of the far superior ""Blade Runner"" (in its directorial cut) and the first ""Matrix"" film. In a sense, this could be the beginning of what happened to people to get involved in a virtual world as the Matrix presented. If they would have added something to the plot it would have worked better for me. At the same time, I like Jim Cromwell, but it looks like he is in a rut of playing corporate bad guys. He deserves better."
4,Husband liked it,My husband watched this video and he said to give it a 4. It was action packed which he liked
2,meh.,"It was predictable and not all that interesting. While the idea behind it is intriguing, I found myself disinterested. None of the characters were very likeable (except for one IT guy who's in two scenes), and there wasn't much character development at all. If you like bad cop movies with a sci-fi twist, this is right up your alley!"
3,A very uneven trip,"Jean-Paul Rappeneau's disappointing but glossy and lavish comedy melodrama set against the fall of France and the birth of the Vichy government in WW2 always feels on the cusp of becoming a better film. It's full of good things but never really hits the spot, perhaps because Isabelle Adjani seems so miscast as a self-centered French movie star who uses those around her, be they screenwriters to dispose of bodies of murdered blackmailers (and take the rap when it goes wrong), ministers to get her out of Paris or German spies when needs must. Like the character, it's not s much that she's bad as that there's nothing to her - she's too much of blank here to convey such a magnetic presence. But Gerard Depardieu's malleable politician (whose final scene is the film's finest and darkest) and Yvan Attal in an underwritten part as a good-natured crook who always does the right thing are among the film's many compensations."
3,C'est Bon...,"I've only recently started watching foreign films regularly. And I can't say that I've enjoyed them all (or that my favorite foreign films could ever surpass my favorite American films, even though I'm not necessarily saying that they couldn't though), I liked this one. It's very quick paced, but not in a way that you can't keep up. It's got several genres wrapped up into one film: romance & mystery & action & history & comedy. It's not likely to bore anyone because there's so much going on all the time. And again, not in a way that one can't stayed invested the whole time though. And in all the characters basically. Overall, the preview I saw for it intrigued me enough to watch it, and the movie turned out to be exactly what the preview suggested."
4,A effective tool at very good price,"I want the impact drill function of this tool. It worked very well. Where I failed with my old regular drill to make a dent on concrete, it took me less than a minute to drill a pilot hole. It does have a switch for regular drill or impact (hammer) drill function. It comes with a depth guide. It lacks torque control. I used only for a few times, both as a hammer drill and as a regular drill. One thing I noticed is that it get hot quickly. It is an effective tool at very good price. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to use an impact drill occasionally."
2,Should have been better,"This book started off as an insightful story about a dying Irish-American way of life and wound up being derivative, cartoonish and silly with violence. Kelly seems to be a solid writer. I hope his next book will be more original."
3,Too fragile for little ones,"We received the Spirit & Family set from Walmart as a gift. My 2 yr old daughter LOVES them, so much so they received the great honor of going to bed with her. Second night, the baby horse's tail broke and could have been quite a choking hazard. What a disappointment. These toys are too fragile for little ones to play with."
5,Spirit stallion of the cimarron,"Spirit is a very fun model but be super duper carefull he is not like other model horses,well he is but be more carefull with him. If you come across a cavalry saddle set you can put it on Spirit and get a cowboy and make Spirit buck him off. I am sure Spirit would like to watch them fly off don't forget to get Rain Spirit's best friend."
5,The Spirit of Breyer,"I think this is not a toy,I think it looks better in a shelf but if you want too play you can but not very hard.I think that in general breyers are not for little children.This Spirit is really beautiful and catchs very the idea of the movie.If you buy Rain they will look wonderful.I have them both."
