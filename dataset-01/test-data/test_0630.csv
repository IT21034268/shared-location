5,Truly Amazing,"This is one of the few products that I have repeatedly purchases. I tried Dream Curls by John Frieda, but it's not the same. My favorite thing about this is that the waves look so natural and it's okay if your hair looks kinda messy cause that's how this product works and the smell of coconut is amazing! I love getting compliments about my hair smelling goodI haven't been able to find it anywhere recently though which is really disappointing. I'm so glad I found it on amazon I think I'm gonna purchase like three bottles to stock up"
4,Good.,"Good product, but it could've been better. Wheels would've been nice, and the design is top heavy making it somewhat unstable."
3,WHATS GOING ON?????,"THIS IS BOOK NUMBER 2 THAT HAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED ME OF MS. DRAKES. SHE IS SUCH A WONDERFULL WRITTER I'M CONFUSED... THIS BOOK WAS VERY DISSAPOINTING, SORRY MS. DRAKE."
4,Great Job,If you like L&H this is the definitive collection!! I've watched them since I was a kid on sunday mornings and though I'm no Son of the Desert I thought I'd seen them all. Besides the Spanish language releases there are 4 I'd never seen before. A real treat!!
5,Laurel & Hardy Collection,"Growng up n the 50's ment a total of 3 stations for television. I am grateful that 1 of those chose to run the Laurel & Hardy shorts on weekends! This brilliant material was inspiration for a young mind hungry for entertainment. My friends and I watched and rewatched these 20 minute gems over and over. And any oppertunity to quote from them was a cause for knowing laughter from your peers. Lines such as ""here's another fine mess"", or Can't you understand We've only got 15 cents?', or ""Twas ever thus"". In any event this beautiful package covers all the Hall Roach comedies including the 3 reelers with I think the single exception of Babes In Toyland. Each short looks great! And they are all wraped up in a fine booklike package with tons of notes. Without question the single finest dvd package I have ever bought!!!"
2,Laurel and Hardy,"I bought this because it was recommended to me. As a young boy I never thought much of Laurel and Hardy. And now, years later nothing has changed."
5,Thank you for finaly releasing this,"I have been waiting for them to release a Laurel and Hardy box set, I already have the marx brothers 2 box sets, the abbott and costello universal set and all the volumes of the 3 stooges. I was wondering when they would release L and H movies in a set, even though its not all their movies but it is still a good collection of their movies. Its also funny watch the spanish versions where the films aren't dubbed but Laurel and Hardy do their lines in spanish. The packaging isn't the best but it doesnt bother me as the discs arived fine and I keep all my DVDs in a DVD book case so its all fine."
5,Worth every penny for loyal fans,"If you are a loyal fan of Laurel and Hardy, The Essential Collection, these DVD's will take you back in time and you will be laughing all the way to the bank. Hope all you fans enjoy these sets as much was we have."
4,Must Have for Stones Fans,"A fascinating history of the Stones by someone who should know. Surprisingly well written, clear-eyed and honest. But, like the Stones' music, great through the early 70's and then increasingly unimaginitive, repetitive and irrelevant. Still a must have history of the greatest rock band."
2,False Advertising!,"I gave it two stars because it did work. However, I would not have known to give it a chance if it weren't for the reviews already posted. There is no ""lightning"" (which one assumes means ""fast"" in this case)effect to this piece. It took approximately 25 minutes for it to clean minor tarnish from one piece. I wouldn't waste my money on it a second time."
4,My Grandchild's First Cell Phone,"My grandchild really loves the phone. She is always on it like she is really talking to somebody.That is a good thing,she can learn how to call someone if she needed help."
2,Not much new here,Most of the tips and strategies presented are available at tax time on almost every tax web site - for free. I found nothing here to make this worth the purchase.
4,i love all of the JG series,"I love the Juniors Giants series--and so do my kids (young and old). They make all of us laugh, and the message is always clear and right on target."
5,Well written and detailed. Fascinating.,"Although not an expert in this field, I find this book loaded with fascinating, detailed information on how insects and amphibians produce and perceive audio information. This book opens a whole new world of understanding regarding the buzz and clicks of insects and the vocalizations of frogs and toads. The text is detailed and scientific, perhaps best understood with some background in the sciences of biology and acoustics. This is not necessarily a beginners introduction to the field, rather a text for those that wish to delve deeper into this interesting subject. My thanks to the authors for the tremendous work they have accomplished in compiling and interpreting the many scientific studies cited and presenting them in an organized manner."
5,Great book,"I am a graduate student who is studying acoustic communication. For people new to this field, this book is an absolute must as it provides a clear and comprehensive review of the work that has been done and even suggest further research in those areas."
5,So far so good.,Not much to say (yet). Have been running these for about three months now. Looked like a quality product and have held up so far.
4,I thought it was a wonderful story,It's a very good story about a thief named Dortmunder Who's old cellmate come's to him for help digging up a 23 year loot from a heist. Dortmunder get's a group together and tries to get the money again and again but they can't make it. The old cellmate wants to blow up the dam so dortmunder has to get the money soon! I forgot to mention that the water's now under a newly built Resevoir!

2,Sad to see Laurel & Hardy in decline,"In this 1944 MGM comedy directed by Sam Taylor, Laurel & Hardy are the chef and butler who foil a plot by enemy agents to poison the young exiled King Christopher (David Leland). On the one hand ""Nothing But Trouble"" spends time developing the boy-king's growing love for the joys of common democracy, such as playing football. Then we have the comic sequences in which Laurel & Hardy wreck a dinner party, try to take a steak away from a hungry lion, and end up on the ledge of a skyscraper. Clearly the boys are getting too old for this kind of stuff. Not as bad as ""The Big Noise,"" but too close for comfort. Watching this one will only make you feel sad and not in a good way."
2,Not as described,This box felt cheap when I picked it up. It was cheap. It also advertises two tool trays and a screwdriver holder. None such were included. There was one small corner that was sectioned off with a small piece of aluminum and that was it. It also says that it has three latch points. Not the case. It came with a single pin/hook latch in the center which didn't look that sturdy. The weather seal is open-cell foam which attracts moisture and dirt. The welding and riveting of the box was average. Overall I felt the box was represented well and didn't come as described. I am looking for another box to try. I returned this on at Amazon's expense.
3,Almost great,"Size-wise, the mini card case is just right. I can almost squeeze everything I need into it. I guess, if something does not fit, you probably don't need it.I just have a complaint about how securely the wallet holds the contents. The material is very slippery so I am unsure as to how safe my cards are. When folded, it is fine. In fact, I have a rubber band around my wallet just in case to keep the stuff together. But when you open it, it feels like the stuff is going to fall out. If you stuff it to the point that things feel more secure, it doesn't fold anymore! Gets negative points for that in my opinion. The wallet should grip the cards a bit tighter.Size is great. Wish it held the cards tighter though."
2,Its ok,"it is a very cheap material, it feels like im going to rip it real easily. It also feels like my cards and money are going to fall out of it, very slippery. If you like this type of wallet then get it, but if you don't like it, i wouldn't recommend it, just my opinion."
2,savage hearts-men of south africa,"disapppointing. didn't realise how old this production was. was made before they started showing anything. DON'T BUY NEW, used is ok."
2,Over priced,These are equivalent to the free inserts that come with swimsuits. They are easily trimmed to size if you are not a B/C.
2,"Too thin for ""nipple concealment""","They're way too thin to do anything in the way of nipple concealment. I'm a 32F or 32DDD, and the DDD size seemed fine, but I don't see any use for them. I wouldn't double them up, as I can already see the outline of these in my bra."
1,What a disappointment!,"Recieved two bad kits - both in Crane factory sealed packaging. The first kit was missing the ignition module. The second kit had a damaged ignition module that occured due to the lack of packing at crane. The heavy coil was placed directly on the face of the ignition module with nothing in place to protect it, breaking one of the switches during transit. Waited two additional weeks for a third unit which was never sent (and RidersNeeds didn't bother to return my phone calls regarding the order status) and cancelled the order. Words to the wise - Crane's packaging of this kit is completely inadequate - Buy the kit locally so you can inspect it for damage!"
3,No notes,"Under ""Editorial Reviews"" it reads that ""This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media."" What this means is that this CD is not manufactured by Naxos, but instead ""by CreateSpace, an Amazon.com company."" Whether this involves a degradation of the audio, I cannot say. But you should note that this product contains no notes concerning the composer, the pieces or the performers. Naxos always provides this information, consistently and competently. The only information is the track listing on the back-- and that does even include time.(I'll let the other worthy reviewers speak to the excellence of the music and the performance, with which I have no complaint.)"
3,Epic Movie,"Great action as you would expect from Jet Li. The landscape and story are good as well, however i would rather have a poorly done voice over than have to try and read subtitles. I always feel as if I'm missing something when I focus on reading instead of listening and just enjoying the movie unfold."
3,Subtitles hard to read,"Go movie, would have been rated higher but the subtitles were in white text against light backgrounds for part of the movie. This made it tough if not impossible to read the text and figure what is going on. Very disappointing."
3,was decent,"I enjoyed it. Could've been better. The acting was good,but the plot could've been as well as the main story line."
1,not good wont recommend,"everything looked fake as a cheap movie. i though jet li acted good , and the story was boring , no stars"
1,Cinematic Rubbish,"After reading Aron Ralston's book Between a Rock and a Hard Place, I wanted to see the film that it inspired. I'm soooo glad I read the book first, or I may not have bothered to read the book. Sadly the film version is vastly inferior to the book. Unfortunately the producers chose to cobble together a slap-dash version that utterly fails to capture the story and character of Aron Ralston and his family, the events that lead up to his harrowing experience in Blue John Canyon, and the significance of that experience for Ralston and for us. This could have been and should have been an exceptional film, but it is just a ""C"" grade flick that is destined to be just a flash in the cinematic frying pan. Don't waste your time or money, read the book--I highly recommend it."
1,Sloooooooooow movie.,"We had to fast forward through a lot of this, really slow and boring. Amazing he got out, hats off to him. But, this movie was just to slow for us."
5,GREAT!!,"It's amazing that he was able to video his entire ordeal. This film actually gives you an insight into what you experience at the brink. your mind, your body your senses.Great cinematography!"
3,Ouch!!!,"This is like watching a drunk get into a car and hoping for the best. It is inspirational rhetoric; ""person-of-the-week"" stuff that often shows up on the ABC Disney news. The blu-ray has the look of a digital intermediate; heavy-handed visual bits and a gimmicky music score don't help."
2,Lost connection,Lost the connection movie had to reboot took over 5 minutes for it to restart was annoying...the movie it's self was good
2,looks good but really boring,I was really excited to see this movie but then 30 mins into it I was just waiting and waiting for it to end. Don't believe the hype. Interesting true story but one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
3,True story,"I don't understand the hooplah of this movie, although it's watchable. Would have been better in a more documentary form."
5,"Brilliant! Beyond brilliant, really.",This movie is my third favourite movie of all time. I absolutely adore it. I have such admiration for Aron Ralston and his story. This movie is so accurate to his book it's almost scary how close it is.
4,127 Hours,I could have given it a higher rating if there weren't so much bad language and nudity in it. I don't know why such a good story needs all that ugly stuff to sell it.
2,Not exactly what you see on the picture,"Although the product description says it's ""lifelike"", the picture seems to suggest that it's kind of a real life plant But it's not what you see on the picture.However Amazon was nice enough to refund me the money when I wanted to return the item."
3,Disappointed,Might have just been me. Thought this was a live plant for my turtles vegetable needs. Nope. Its plastic. Looks really pretty in the tank though.
1,Bad description,"Terrible. The way the product was worded, made it sound like they were live plants for my outdoor pond, but this is not true. The description should be clear and say that these are ""Plastic plants for an indoor aquarium,"" and not an outdoor live pond."
3,False Advertising,"When I bought my Oreck XL21 from the Oreck dealer it came with a small vacuum as well as a 21 year ""free"" service. It was around $700. at the time. I took it in for the first service and was charged $45. for my ""free"" service. I wrote to Oreck to complain. They told me to go to the very same store that charged me. I wrote back and told them that it was the same store and never heard from them again.The vacuum itself is okay. It leaves a lot behind though. I do have a big long haired dog. I wouldn't call it efficient. I just ordered the Dyson 23 animal today. Can't wait to get it. Buying an Oreck was an expensive mistake."
5,Completely Engaging!,"This BBC series has fantastic acting--very underplayed, unpretentious and yet very strong; historic WW2 life plots that give insight into daily living in southern England during the war; as well as engaging murder mysteries with multiple, complex characters. Although this is a made-for-TV series, the characters are complex and remain authenticate throughout the years of production. Great entertainment."
5,(No title).,"Alkan's Esquisses, perfect self-contained miniatures, rank among his most important works. More interested in a courageously forward-looking breath of mood than technical display, these pieces are essential for newcomers and veterans alike. Martin's performances are sharply etched and beautifully crafted, recorded very well. Highly recommended!"
3,Another step into Leadership,Leadership can be taught and this book is just another step in your journey to piece the leadership puzzle together.
2,Don't Bother.,"Though having a few good bits in it for the girls, this series was terrible. Don't bother buying it. It doesn't go anywhere."
2,Not the jelly rings I grew up with,"I grew up getting jelly rings from the dept store candy counters, but they are increasingly hard to find. I ordered these hoping they would be the same, but they are not. These are a dark chocolate (I'm not a fan of dark chocolate), and even taste a little old or stale. The raspberry filling is not as sweet as I expected either."
2,Over Rated,"After reading all of the reviews I thought this would be a ""must see"". It was ""OK"", basicly like a documentary from the Discovery Channel. If you want to see the history of VanNuys airport buy it. Not a great flying video.Jim Oshkosh,WI"
1,Would not play in four different players.,"There is something unique about this disc's format, and it should have been pointed out in big huge letters. I could not get it to play. I tried HD DVD, Blu-ray DVD, and regular DVD players, four in all. I'll just watch this show using Amazon Instant Video. $20 wasted."
1,One Six Right,The DVD is an HD version.. which will not play on MOST players. I purchased One Six Left at the same time and that one was a normal DVD and a great show. I E-mailed Sporty's Customer Service center and told them of my problem and their suggestion was to go out on Ebay and purchase a HD DVD player so I could watch just this one movie.. Why would I purchase an out of date player and why would they sell this HD disk when they know the players are no longer available! Since I open the package I am sure I can not return it..
1,Disappointed,"I ordered DVDs of ""One Six Right,"" for gifts. Unfortunately, all DVDs were blank and I had to return them for credit. It was apparent that the disks had been labeled and sent without being recorded.I rated this item 1 star. Would rather have rated it No Stars, but you insisted on a rating so it gets one star.I had seen this show on PBS, loved it and wanted to share it with other family members. Very disappointed.Lorraine Gimlin"
4,A feel good flick for enthusiasts,I like this DVD because it is about an interest of mine. It so happens that I am earning my wings and expect to pass my PPL in the spring of 2008. The academic side is already in the bag. I also bought One Six Left.
1,Do Not get this tub!,"I got this tub as a baby shower gift. I agree with the other comments. The ""ergonomic support"" does not support! My son was sliding all over the place and I eventually bought a separate support to put in. I gave it a one instead of a 0 because the additional sprayer works pretty well, but you need to push the rubber part of the hose onto the bathtub faucet to connect and I am always afraid of pulling the faucet off when I am taking off the hose.The little connectors used to ""expand"" the tub are always coming un-done and come off. It's not very easy to put together either! I got frustrated and yelled at my husband to do it. When we use it, we always say how much we hate it!I wish I would have thought to do some research on infant bathtubs, instead of just saying I need a tub and let someone else pick for me.Do Not get this bathtub!"
5,The Speckled Monster Rocks!,"I read this a couple of years ago and still find myself eagerly recommending it to all comers. The events couldn't be more dramatic and the extensive historical research done by the author makes the very well-written story more educational than any textbook of immunology. The endnotes are also well worth reading. I guess for me the power of this story is that with tremendous courage, against tremendous barriers, these two unlikely heroes changed the world for the better. While the lives saved is obviously the major benefit, by any other standard of measurement, particularly economic, this small and relatively inexpensive intervention given at an early stage was shown to be enormously effective and to have incalculable societal benefits downstream. This book is a keeper, one of the small number I will read again. It should be required reading in high school and medical school."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An author famous for her neopagan non-fiction work, has come up with ascience fiction novel. A fairly mundane effort, with the interest beingthe different approach. A group in San Francisco resist a dictatorial,technological society and try and do so non-violently, rather thanthrough war, secret agents or other methods. They try to maintain theirneopagan sort of outlook, unsurprisingly.Other than that, pretty generic adventure structure, these guys areobviously Good, almost unbelievably so at times, and the other guys areBad, no question."
5,It will change your life.,"The Fifth Sacred Thing put into focus the goals of where I would like my life to be heading. Trying to live a peaceful, peace-filled life is one thing, but politically, how can this help me? Reading about a society that truly walks the walk was so uplifting and encouraging for me. This would be a great book to read to recover from burnout!"
1,The editorial reviewer is right on,"I have to agree with the first review. The novel contains vital messages of ecological sustainability, gender equality, and intriguing use of ""supernormal"" human abilities in everyday life as the next stage of human society's evolution; however, while this would be a great book for a 12-18 year old, adult readers may find both the writing style and the story to be cliched and clumsy.It's ultimately ground that Mercedes Lackey covers far more skillfully in her ""Oathbreakers"" and ""Heralds of Valdemar"" novels. I was deeply disappointed with this work and donated my copy to Goodwill. I hear that Starhawk's non-fiction is much better, and I'll keep an open mind."
1,A Waste of Time,"This book is poorly written, the plot is convoluted and characters inane. Supposedly a novel of a Utopian society, Starhawk's novel is a soapbox on which she can preach her very bizaare ideas."
1,Bullsh**,"Absolutely, without a doubt the worst essay since the third grade attempt of the worst student in our class."
2,Ima take a solo there and there and there...oh yeah and there...,"It's not that there aren't some great songs and performances on this DVD, it's not that you're not seeing a great band performing live.It's that Ritchie Blackmore, virtuoso that he is, insists on taking long drawn out solos before and after and sometimes in the middle of almost every song. So each time some energy and momentum is built up he sucks the life out by noodling around.I found myself fast-forwarding after a while and I was amazed how long I had to do that to get to the next song. It's not that I don't enjoy guitar solo's but dang man....enough is enough...."
4,a history of violence,wawou ronnie james dio cozy powell ritchie blackmore that is a famous group so this dvd is not a very exemple of sound of image but what a show ronnie dio sing so well so i recommend this to all fans of rainbow and i wait for another concert in dvd of rainbow
3,the 3 stars are for DIO,"DIO as always does an amazing job, but Blackmore's solo's are way to damn long to the point of turning off the dvd, and he has to much camera time. The intro's to every song are most annoying aswell; Blackmore going on and on and on to the point of yelling at the TV screen for him to pack off and start the song. This is a Rainbow dvd not Blackmore's jam session....."
5,Lifesaver,"I ran over a basketball with my snowblower, which became jammed between the impeller and the housing. I could not remove it despite rmany hours of trying and use of multiple tools. With this blade I was able to trim the excess rubber right down to the jammed area and then finish the job with a small hand saw (usually used to cut branches). Saved a $100+ trip to the repair shop! Not a standard use for this blade but an inexpensive, good addition to a tool kit for odd uses like this!"
3,desk lamp,"very bright but generates a considerable amount of heat that I was unprepared for. Also, hsa a cord ""roller"" switch that is approx. 1.5 feet from the device. This is a design flaw since it sits on a desk, and the cord typically dangles off the back."
4,Don't turn the black knobs or the screws will come out!,"Otherwise a great lamp, but you'll be in a world of pain if you try to ""adjust"" the black knobs which look like they need adjusting but really are just supposed to be left alone."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This!!!!!!,"I wish I had read the reviews here before coming across this in the store and buying it! This toy is flimsy, cheaply made and doesn't last. The sponge brushed hardly last through one session with the toy. Crayola should be embarressed for making and marketing this toy, especially for the price point! It is junk and I wish I could get my money back!"
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"very suprisingly poorly made toy and not for the age they have specified...possible would work for much older. The colors make a big mess, small pieces are easily lost/hard to keep in order and the pens dont write very well when you wet them. If I didnt get this online and we hadnt made a MESS of it trying to work it, you can bet it would have been returned because Im very unhappy with this purchase!!!"
3,Ok but too much stiffing for my hair...,"I like the smell, and it works great for someone that needs more control than I do in their hair. I prefer more of an oil."
5,good but not for me,The product I ordered was a book on Hummels. The book itself was perfect but the wrong book for me so I had to send it back. The delivery was prompt and the book was in good condition.
2,"Great while it lasted, but not worth the money","I owned this camera (Photosmart R727) for about 15 months. Took great pictures. Easy to use. Small size made it very convenient. Had all the features I needed and battery life was great. Unfortunately (and for no apparent reason) it experienced a hardware failure which immediately rendered the camera useless (no viewscreen). After discussing with HP, they determined it was unrepairable. So I basically have to buy a new camera. After reading several other reviews, it appears this is not uncommon for this model. I don't have much experience with other brands besides Kodak, but for a reliable long-term camera, I won't buy another HP."
3,Okay,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as Scruples 2, which I didn't like as much as the first Scruples. It almost felt like it was written by a different writer using Judith Krantz's characters. Billy and Gigi are too perfect, incapable of mistakes - and every guy uses ""Darling"" as a term of endearment.Still liked it better than her other books, though."
1,Overly religious,"I made it through the first chapter but by chapter two the non-stop religious references were too much to handle. Every single page has some sort of religious reference which is a bit much, even though I live in the buckle of the Bible Belt. So down went the book not to be read any more.However the Checklists for Women Home Alone at the end of the book are very useful and worth using as organizational reference."
5,Should be remade in English with same stars,"The actress, Sarit Vino Elad, who plays a ""madam"" at an ""escort"" bureau provides a stunning performance. Ms Vino Elad should be brought to Hollywood to recreate this role and become one of the greatest actors in the US. Remember, Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, both emigrated from Europe to the US."
4,Worthwhile architectural guidebook,"As one of very few guides to the architecture of Tokyo presented in English, this book further delivers by presenting each building in terms of its historical context. As such, the reader gains an understanding of the many forces shaping Japanese architecture from ""traditional"" times to the present day. Though organized by historical period instead of geographic location, all buildings are keyed to detailed maps at the back of the book to help you find your way, or even to help you pick out buildings of interest in whatever area of the city you happen to be. So while this book does *not* offer glossy photos, it will get you there to take your own, and should be very helpful for visitors to Tokyo who are looking for an architectural guidebook with content over flash."
1,Work of Fiction not for the Practicing Witch,"This book and all books from the same author are extremely well written in a poem like style.It is a very beautiful book to read if you are looking for entertainment and an embellished work of simple and pure fiction.But if you are a serious Witch or Magician and intend to practice real magic, I would never recommend this book."
1,"Literally, not one laugh from me the whole movie!",Every couple of years there is one movie that stands out as the worst movie I have seen. This is it!
5,Woody Allen's best!,"I was disappointed for the first few minutes of the movie.It seemed more like a travelogue.Then it started to improve.It became very thought provoking and a fascinating view into human beliefs.I ended up loving the flick.Wonderful, thoughtful, insightful, really brilliant movie."
5,Fabulous Seller!,"The DVD arrived so quickly, that the seller must have posted it the day the order was received. Great service! I bought the movie for a friend, but I have my own copy too, and have watched it 5 or 6 times. Good movie.Thanks so much to this exceptional seller!"
4,Extremely clever Woody Allen film,"For those who love Paris, this is a film to see. Woody Allen ingeniously invents a plot to combine many aspects of Paris into one movie. Owen Wilson does a good job in the movie, meeting all sorts of historical personages from Paris' past."
4,Would give a 4.5 if possible,"I don't know that I can say I loved this movie but I walked out of the theatre feeling great. It was a beautifully filmed piece set amongst the backdrops of Paris. The basic premise of this movie is a writer, who is struggling to finish a novel, goes to Paris with his girlfriend and her parents. One night while walking through the streets of Paris after hours he discovers a rift in time that takes him back to the 20's where he meets all of the famous writer who frequent high school reading lists these days. He seeks his inspiration among them and find himself falling in love with a young muse he meets (Marion Cotillard, who is stunning!). This was a beautiful film to watch that left me as a viewer feeling happy (and a little bit more excited for an impending trip to France!). The music was beautifully picked, costumes were perfect, the characters were wonderful. I guess I did love it after all!"
5,loved it!,"This is the best movie I've seen in years! Finally an entertaining movie with intelligence, humor, lovely scenes of Paris, great music - and a message. No crashing cars, burning buildings, or blatant and meaningless sex. A marvelous and intriguing story line....And one could actually hear the dialogue in the absence of background noise so increasingly annoying lately. I saw it in a theater and recommend that if it's still out near you but I will also have to own this one. Woody Allen....a master.jean"
1,Not my type,"This movie was long to get to the point, unrealistic and very boring in my opinion. I don't recommend watching this movie even if you are bored."
2,Poor effort (spoilers),"I enjoy the literature that came out of Paris in the 20's. I enjoy the idea of Paris although I've never been there. I did not like this movie. It was typical Wood Allen. The main characters just argue their way through the movie. Boring! The characters from the 20's were dealt with in cliches. The Hemingway character was over blown. The Owen Wilson character loves his girl friend, but then jumps to a girl from the past then switches to yet another woman at the end and this is supposed to be romance? Dull and contrived. A few laughs, but very few. I give a star for the beautiful photography of Paris and one for the great music."
2,This movie does not deserve more then 2 stars,"I had high hopes for this movie, since the trailer looked promising and the cast seemed of high quality. It failed to deliver the punch for me. The story line had some momentum, but in the end it remained flat. I kept waiting for something more exciting other then traveling through the timelines, but that was about the most exciting part of the movie."
3,Midnight in Paris,"It was an ""okay"" watch. Needed something while on a 4 hour plane ride. It kept me busy - that's all."
5,Midnight in Paris DVD,I am so glad that this DVD was here exactly on the date promised and in perfect condition. Really made my day!
2,Blueray not compatible with my blueray player,"I liked the movie - but I bought the blueray format and found that there was no dialog - there was background noise but the characters speaking lines were totally silent. I thought it was a bad disk, but I put it in my computer and it worked fine. For some reason, the blueray technology keeps ""improving"" but my blueray player (Samsung) doesn't change. Very frustrating...."
5,Fun give away!,"I purchased this DVD as a give away for a Parisian-themed party, and it was a wonderful prize for my guests!"
5,Midnight in Paris,What can I say . . . I've seen it 6 times and we're talking about pulling it out again to enjoy.
2,Not good at all,"Don't waste your time. The historical figures were just name dropping, rather than introducing any interesting facts or stories. Both my wife and I did not like it."
2,"Great Concept, but poor performance by Owen.","The concept was a novel idea as I can relate being in love with the WWII era here in the states in contrast to Gil's (Owen Daniel)fascination with the 1920's in Paris, France; however, there was no substantial development in the psyche and desire for this infatuation. It was not believable, mainly due to a poor performance by Owen who should stick to the more traditional comedies and by the way this was at no point a comedy and should not be regarded as such. If another actor pick any in lieu of Owen would have been chosen for this role the movie would stand a better chance."
1,No Dialogue,I am having the same problem with the DVD.....no sound in dialogue. I also have a Samsung player and I have not experienced any problems until I played this disc. This is the second copy I have gotten from Amazon and the 2nd copy is the same as the 1st copy...no dialogue. Samsung sent me a software disc to correct the problem and it is not fixed. I called them again yesterday and they said there is another software disc coming out that should hopefully correct the problem...WE WILL SEEE.
1,"Aweful acting, Aweful story line, Aweful","First, the acting is terrible...TERRIBLE. Second..the story didn't take me anywhere...i felt as if I was watching a boring high school theater act. Thirdly, ending was weird and sucked. Fourthly, if they thought it's a comedy, the humor was not existent."
3,"Good book, but oh!","""Ragweed"" is a good yarn in and of itself, but only if you haven't read ""Poppy."" I mean, how could you enjoy getting to like this mouse when you know full well he's going to be cruelly killed right off the bat in the next book?"
2,GARBAGE,"First, i read Poppy in 5 grade, and i really liked it. So, i decided to read all of the books, and decided to read this book. It was so boring, and nothing realy happened that was rely intresting. To me, none of it was funny. It was boring, and it was a book that dragged on and on and on.Then, i did a book report on it, so I had to read it again, because it was a year later. WOW, was I bored. It was just realy stupid, boring, dumb, useless, and awful.So, i do not recomend this book!Read Poppy though, its amazing."
3,Not what I expected,"I saw a lot of good reviews, so I picked up this book and it's not exactly what I expected. The book only has about 89 pages of information and the second part of the book is math formulas. The book covers these formulas and then they post excel sheets and there's a calculator on their web site that does the calculations for you, so most of the reading is a waste of my time. Also the majority of examples are for people who want to own office buildings or apartments and not single family homes.The one positive thing I can say about this book is that it gets you to think and you can have a more accurate picture about how much something is goign to cost you before you buy it and what you can expect and a lot of good rule of thumbs"
5,every photo a story,"Sun printing relies on natural sunlight to produce an image on paper brushed with a mixture of minerals. Linda's sunprints have a mystical & elusive quality & in this modern woman's perspective we see combinations of spontaneous poses with still backgrounds; overlays & tonal changes in cyan & sepia.Such gently detailed, whimsical & earthy sights of a boy print or an amarylis; a castle reflected in its watery moat; a terrace balustrade casting sunny shadows upon snow; a stalwart cactus in a desert or a triad of lanterns on a London bridge; of lively faces & ancient hands; of birds & beaches & seasons' abundance. Meditative, heart-warming, peaceable pictures, some simply swatches of brush strokes offering glimpses of what her eyes had seen.Linda McCartney's photographs always have stories to tell & make me want to talk about them!"
4,Swim Time Leaf Bagger,"Instructions are not great with this product. It took me a while to figure out to take the piece out where the hose goes in. Once that was out and the hose screwed in correctly it works GREAT. My 6 year old grandson could get the leaves out. I do recommend this as inexpensive way to clean your pool.Sincerely,AliciaArkansas"
2,No way to keep handle connected - thus useless,"The ""handle adapter"" is the reason I ordered this. first of all, it did not adapt to my very standard handle, and we had to cut off the end of the handle with a hacksaw to get it to fit. Then, there is just a little cheap plastic pin holding the handle and handle adapter in place, the pin comes out constantly, detaching the handle and renderring this completely useless. Very frustrating. If not for this problem it would work fairly well."
2,Ugh!,"I made the mistake of buying a multi-pack of this product without trying a sample first. The jerky was tough and dry, and included some pieces that seemed to be just dried skin. The seasoning is good, but it hardly mattered."
1,P-U shoe leather,"this product used to be acceptable a few years back. now its dry.sinew-ish,funky old turkey flavor like road kill possum burger. sorry snackmasters change your name to slackmasters"
1,A Mile Wide And An Inch Thin,"For an experienced financial professional, this text does not add much value. The book touches upon a great many subjects, but does not appear to cover any one in any depth. The book may be most appropriate as an introductory text on the subject on the undergraduate level but not as a practioner's desk reference. As a professional with significant experience in investment banking with a CPA and MBA, I was looking for in-depth guide to the specific mechnanics of the contoller's function."
2,After12 months of good life,"I purchased this camera through Amazon for a good price. Used it for several important events with great pictures. However, after 12 months when the warranty expired, the LCD screen no longer works. Camera lost most of its features."
2,Kodak Easy Share,"The Camera works fine, although I should have bought a smaller one that is easier to carry.The printer dock stopped working after a few dozen prints. The message on is says it's out of paper, even though it's fuly loaded with paper.I would not purchase this product again"
4,Oswaldo Vera VENEZUELA,"For my instance I think this product is excelent mainly by the price. This camera is more small than they appear, but is very funtional, generating great photos but the video is not the same, is deficient, whitout the audio is amazing, I dont have nothing more to tell, I very pleased whit my camera Kodak EasyShare Z650!"
4,"Great pictures most of the time, sometime a little fuzzy.","I love this camera! It is easy to use. However, when using the zoom pictures tend to be a little fuzzy. It is difficult to keep the camera totally still. I purchased the memory card at the same time I ordered the camera and it is a must have."
4,A great camera at a great price!,I am extremely happy with this purchase! I LOVE the 10x zoom when taking pics of my kids!
5,Camera man,I have z650 camera and i love it. The one i purchase from you is a christmass gift. I belive the person that i give it to will like it as i do.merry christmashappy customer
3,It's a road guide,"This is laid out like the AAA strip maps, each strip covering 5 to 15 miles, with a large-scale map on the inside front cover as an index to the strips. The strips indicate where the turnouts are for a stop, and are a useful guide to the terrain as you drive along each of the Glacier Park roads. No data for hiking, camping, accomodations, etc. but restroom and restaurant locations are given."
3,Konsider kollecting,"With its fair share of pseudo-white-jazz-funk, Kollektiv can occasionally become stained by corny production values and tired grooves, though overall manages to lay down a few altogether intriguing tracks, keeping the disc considerable."
5,Love it!,This is from my era & I love the music! Takes me back. Can't wait to see Jersey Boys in Chicago.
2,Like The Four Seasons? So what's the best CD available?,"After seeing Jersey Boys in Los Angeles I remembered how much I loved ""Sherry"" when it first came out, and I was just a kid at the time. In fact, there's never been a song that excited me as much as ""Sherry"". Watching the play I loved the Four Season's music, but if you want to buy one of their CD's with all their great songs I would advise ""Back to the Diner, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons"" over ""Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons"". I ordered ""Very Best---"" because it had December,1963 (Oh, What a Night), which was a delightful number in Jersey Boys, but the version on the CD is too disco, and too 1970's. In fact, a few of the later songs on the CD do have a disco sound. So, ""Very Best---"" has all their big hits, but if you have an opportunity to buy ""Back to the Diner, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons"" I'd recommend that over ""Very Best----""."
5,Great hits from the FOUR SEASONS,This is the best collection of the FOUR SEASONS hits. A great trip from the past with songs that still carry well into the next century.
5,Classic Franki Valli,"What's not to like about this album. I regreted that I didn't buy any of their music ""back in the day"", but now I have a compilation of all my favorites from this talented group. Love it!!"
5,Great tunes!,"I bought this CD to get the complete Four Seasons hit collection, and this is it!! We saw Jersey Boys recently, and it was great, but no comparison to the real deal...you won't be disappointed!"
4,blast from the past,"if you remember this era, this is a great for memories. listening to these old songs remind you of the times past. great set of songs."
5,Superb Bluegrass - not a bad cut on it - serious Bluegrass.,"Having listened to Bluegrass for over 40 years and the traditional sounds of Flatt and Scruggs, Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers, the Lonesome River Band has proven once again the precision and beauty that is traditional Bluegrass. This CD has given us the pleasure of showcasing a young band that has all the power and drive of the best in Bluegrass history. The mix of the old with the new is wonderful and the songs tie themselves together with comfort and technical virtuosity. Keep this CD in the front of your collection because you are going to play it a lot."
1,HP Deskjet 460 Printer Wireless Printer Card,Even with tech support we could never get this card to work and had to return it.
1,HELP!,"After 2 days, online downloads, online ""help"", reloading, rebooting, This wireless card will not work...The light is on, but nobody's home. I you did it it to function....contact me...I need the help.. I have a Dell Inspiron 6000 w/ Win XP. I am not new to computers....but I'm totally out of ideas...."
3,Slow Start,"As in all 'hand held footage', the movie does take awhile for it to get interesting but when it does, it works. I did enjoy the twist ending it has. Not one of my favorites but overall, it's alright."
1,Weak,I thought this documentary was really weak. I feel like I got ripped to be honest haha As I watched this documentary I found myself constantly looking to see how much time was left. It's really a film that you have to sit through verses a film that you watch. It failed to grab my attention at any point. The people this film interviews are extremely annoying either because they seem dumb or are very clearly racist. This DVD is tainting my collection.
5,works great,This is my second drill dr. It sharpens bits very easily. I can do an OK job with a grinding wheel but this works much better each and every time. This newer chuck is a dramatic improvement over my older style chuck. Now even short bits can be sharpened easily.
4,"For the homeowner, or very light commercial","I bought the 350 when a local store was going out of business. I have just used it to sharpen 16 bits (my first time to use it). It is simple to use and the included DVD is very clear on how to use and clean the machine. My observation is that it's a good homeowner level tool for 1/4"" bits and up. Maybe the smaller ones will do better after the wheel smooths down some, but the small bits did not seem to sharpen well in this machine. I did find that on the larger bits that I had previously sharpened on a grinder, if after 10 rotations I realigned the bit, it came out much better. It does take several times of installing and aligning the bit to get it right, but after you have done 3 or 4 bits, you know immediately if you have it aligned right or not."
4,Watch the video,"Works as advertised, but there is still a bit of skill required. Different size drills need more or less turns. The instructions for aligning the drill in the chuck are somewhat vague (for me, at least). The video helps, but still could be more specific on alignment."
4,not such a good first impression,"My first impression of the Drill Dr. 350X was not great.The cord is stiff and impossible to straighten out in cool temperatures (45 F degrees when I tried it out).Two of the four small rubbery feet that the unit rests on were loose in the box.The instructional DVD played on my computer but had no sound. I tried four player utilities that I know played other DVDs without a problem. I was able to go online to see how to use the Drill Dr.The grinding surface on the sharpened drills was much coarser than a new drill would have.On the plus side, it seemed to work well enough for a hobbyist like me and it was gratifying to see my old drill bits renewed. I did not drill any holes yet with the sharpened drills.I think the Drill Dr. 350X will work fine for a hobbyist."
1,Deliberately obfuscated nonsense.,"I got about one-third of the way through this book, and then just couldn't continue. This is without a doubt the worst science book I've ever (tried to) read. Edelman goes out of his way to use unnecessarily long, ponderous phrases to describe simple concepts. This is presumably meant to impress you, but personally it makes me wonder what the author is trying to hide. How about this: that his ideas are neither new, nor original, nor correct."
5,Fine replacement part,"Just the annual replacement filter for my 400-series Bemis humidifier, but obviously manufactured by someone else. The part fit well and is working fine."
3,Mmmm. Not Sure.,"Maybe I have to watch it again to give it a better rating but I was not impressed. The story was kind of piece-meal.I bought it when I saw Oliver Samuel's name, but don't be fooled, it is not the kind of Oliver Samuels drama we are used to, and it is certainly NOT flavored with Samuels..."
5,Trailer for Where the Dogs Divide Her,"Length:: 2:35 MinsHunger Cult Films, Martin Rutley - Where The Dogs Divide HerHunger Cult Films, Martin Rutley - Where The Dogs Divide HerHope you enjoy it."
1,Skip This One,"The 1 star says it all. This video is only of interest to fans who like his raw un-westernized music.Sorry but this DVD did nothing for me, yet I am a huge fan of his recordings on the REALWORLD label."
3,"Master, my foot","One reviewer, who regards Ayn Rand as a ""master,"" writes, ""You will see her accept commonly held bad ideas early in her career, only to later discover their flaws and repudiate them.""Nahhh. You will see her accept _uncommonly_ held bad ideas early in her career, later to replace them with worse ideas. She started out as a vulgar Nietzschean and eventually slapped a little Aristotle over top of it. Read this book and watch it happen.As the _Kirkus_ review above notes, Rand started out with her attitudes already fully formed and fished around in philosophy for ideas that would ""justify"" them. The result is a long career consisting of little but rationalization -- and her butt-kissing ""cult"" proves it.Read this book, all right -- but read it as an example of how _not_ to be a great thinker. Capitalism deserves better than this."
1,Valueless,"For her recently published book, Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right, Professor Jennifer Burns was granted access to the Ayn Rand Archives; this included access to Ayn Rand's journals.She found that Rand's journals had been edited by David Harriman in ways that are ""significant and problematic."" Burns said Harriman's changes ""significantly alter Rand's meaning"" in a number of cases, transforming the tentative and evolving ideas in Rand's notes into ""a slick manufactured world in which all her ideas are definite, well formulated, and clear."" In effect, Burns is saying that the published Journals are valueless as a scholarly source. Scholars and other readers who take Rand seriously will have to wait until a full and accurate version of the Journals becomes available. Until then, stay away from this travesty."
2,Utterly mediocre,"Utterly mediocre and instantly forgettable films. With that said, considering the low price this collection is worth considering, as they are all at least watchable."
2,Horror movies??....NOT.,"I'm a horror movie fan, Thought this would be a good movie to watch but didn't really like it .I only liked one of the 4 which was the HILLS that one was okay but the rest sucked.They were boring and not scary at all and looked fake. I do NOT recommend it if you like horror movies."
5,Single best book on novel writing,"This is the single most useful book I've found on the complex task of novel writing. Even experienced fiction writers will find this book useful as a basic checklist of elements that all good storytelling requires. (Yes, I know, sometimes you can break a rule or two, but only if there's good reason in a particular creation.) If I were teaching Novel Writing 101, this would be the textbook."
2,Worst Book Ever....and He's a Book Agent?!,"Don't waste your time buying this one. This book was the most conceited, boring, and negative book I've ever read on writing novels. Each page is dripping with negativity, putting down ""first time novelists"" and using them as an example of everything that writers do wrong. Well, ahem, every author has been a first time novelist at some point. While his points--buried deep within mounds of superfluous chatter--may be basic, the book actually made me NOT want to write a novel at all. His points could have been made while at the same time encouraging (not discouraging) people to write. Shame on him for killing hope and inspiration. Stop writing books and go back to your day job, dude."
2,I agree with female author,"Would you go to a failed stockbroker for advice on investing? Would you ask a lousy baseball player how to improve your technique? Would you take Spanish lessons from someone who hasn't mastered the language? Of course not. Why would you?Unfortunately, when it comes to writing, the world is full of self-proclaimed experts: people who claim to know how to write ""a breakout novel,"" a bestseller, the great American novel, etc., but have proven incapable of doing so themselves.I checked this book more out of curiosity than anything and, unsurprisingly, I found it to be rather shallow and unhelpful. For great writing advice I suggest reading two brilliant authors: Sol Stein (""Sol Stein on Writing""), Edith Wharton (""The Writing of Fiction""), or anyone else who has actually been able to do what they are supposedly teaching you. (And, S. F. Williams, rating a book you haven't read with five stars only makes you look like a fool.)"
2,Spreading Free Market to Iraq?,"In the author's view, US is trying to spread capitalism and democracy to Iraq, and not for its oil. What a naive thought, why do US want to spread those to Iraq? Iraq is too small in term of market size and population.US is build on individualism, and individualism is about consumer rights, not the suppliers'. US want to control the supply side of the oil to benefit its consumers back home (in a way by strengthening the dollar, so that dollar would remain a major reserve currency for the Asian Central Banks, and to be able to buy cheap imports from developing world, and also to be able to continue print the dollar). If US were really sincerely wanted to spread capitalism and democracy, it would choose a country with potential of a sizable market, i.e. China or India. Which would be easier to have bigger part of global population on its side of the American's ways.The author does not understand the bigger picture of current global politic and economy"
1,Not the original artists!,"I was very disappointed when the CD arrived, I popped it in my stereo, and I instantly realized that the songs are not the versions performed by the original artists but instead some studio band. The information page for the CD doesn't make that clear. So be warned, these recordings aren't nearly as good as the originals."
3,From the back cover:,"Jessica Wheeler is a beautiful and talented New York lawyer searching for the American Dream and handsom Mark Laidlaw is the financial wizard who has found it. When they meet, they ingite a passion in each other that will forever change their world of multimillion dollar deals, cutthroat rivalries and deceit. From New York to Paris; Broadway to London's West End; Hollywood hills to the beaches of Sardinia; Jessica's hopes and dreams are tested. To keep them alive, she must learn to survive the jungle of the boardroom, and the temptations of steamy while satin."
5,"Terrific DEVOTIONAL, not a story","This is a wonderful book of devotions to get you started for the day or to meditate on at night. Whoever wrote the review about a story must have the wrong book. This is a story, it is a 100-day devotional."
1,A hateful story listener,"This was a terrible story. I DO NOT RECOMEND IT, INFACT YOU ARE CRAZY IF YOU READ THIS BOOK."
2,Not happy,"The book, for which I spent around $50, arrived in much worse condition than represented, thanks to the binding having come completely unglued from the spine. Maybe the seller just didn't catch it, but maybe they should have."
3,"Wonderful Arrangements, but lackluster performance","My absolute favorite songs for orchestra and saxophone repertoire i'm afraid were very much disgraced in this recording. The recording was not done properly, although i will give her a hand on her technique and Glazounov performance. THe orchestra is wonderful, but the other performances were lacking something, an expressive element that just simply was not present. The soloist lacked the leading ability needed in a saxophone performance. I wouldn't recommended this CD."
3,"Good Blowdryer, Crap Attachment","The blow dryer itself is very good. It gets really hot and it gets your hair super straight. However, I've only had it a few months, and a piece on the comb attachment has already broken off. I might as well render the dryer useless without the attachment in order to get my hair as straight as I want it. Good luck finding a replacement, because I do not believe they sell them separately and standard blow dryer attachments will not fit on the dryer."
2,hair dryer - not too special,"too hard to use. So I paid $50 for an $18 hairdryer; maybe if I watched the video, I could use it better"
4,Well worth the read,As a Special Education teacher the information is valuable and applicable to the classroom! It is very understandable and informative.
4,easy to swallow,"A lot of tablets and other products deliver the recommended amount of calcium and other minerals needed for bone health, but these capsules are much easier to get down than hard tabs. I'll be getting the results of a bone density scan back in a few days, and then I'll update this review with the results. I haven't been able to exercise for the past year, so I don't expect to see any real improvement in bone density, but I'm hoping that my osteopenia hasn't gotten worse."
3,Failed to capture my imagination...,"After his brilliant ""Siempre Es Hoy"" which blew the roof away and off of which all these remixes are made, this album seems like a step back. There was not a single remix in here that I found interesting or adding much to Cerati's work, which is what you expect with the processing of an artist's music by a DJ: unfortunately that wasn't the case here.I am not completely sad about it, because it seems to be the case with Cerati, where he puts out a brilliant album followed by one that leaves you scratching your head a bit. I guess I will stand by for his next production. ;)"
1,Outrageous shipping costs!!,"Gee, another seller overcharging on shipping costs for a Marchioro cage... This seller says the shipping weight of the cage weighs 73 pounds so they can charge you almost $60.00 to ship an item that only costs $60.00 - AMAZING! Beware of these outrageous shipping costs and do your research to find reputable dealers that charge fair S&H fees. This item weighs more like 18 lbs, unless BIG (rip-off) EDGE is using concrete for packaging materials....lol"
1,does not fit,"Used the ""find parts"" selector and it came back with this brake shoe pad for my 2005 Nissan Quest.Part would not fit pedal and when I read the package it said : applications for various Ford Models ""1997-92""Dont know what the deal is but this company needs to work on improving something here !!Will go to Auto parts store next time !!"
3,One bright spot...,"The only item on this disc really worth listening to is a great update of ""Sincerely"" by G. G. (?) Who pray tell is that? Are those a person's initials or does it stand for a group? Does she or do they have any more tracks available? Maybe I just don't listen to enough contemporary Pop but I'd like to hear more of ""G.G.""!"
2,Didn't live up to the hype for me,"I really didn't enjoy this movie. There were several reasons, the main one being that the movie unfolded like a tawdry soap opera rather than an intelligent suspense-drama. It was all just too ridiculous. There were also a lot of gorey scenes involving the lead character and her obsession with picking at herself. That made me really queasy throughout the movie. Natalie was not all that convincing as a ballerina and I find her mostly boring as a screen presence. She did have some good moments though, and the movie also had some interesting twists -- though for me not enough to recommend the movie. If Portman's performance is the best female performance of the year, it doesn't say a lot for the competition."
2,I wish I could get my 2 hours back...,"I watched this the other night, and while its not awful, I'm not sure why everyone is finding it so dramatic or great. Yes, her acting is good, but the story itself is not; i actually found it to be very blah and wanted it to end soon after it started. I don't see how this is a psychological thriller... she's just messed up, nothing thrilling about that. Now that I have seen this, I truly believe Nicole Kidman should have won an Oscar for Rabbit Hole - much better story and very dramatic with superb acting all the way around."
1,Overrated. Depressing.,"As I write this there are already 87 one star reviews which already do a more than adequate job in detailing the shortcomings of this overrated movie. I wrote this because I wanted to cast my one star vote in the hopes that it would give a more accurate evaluation to what I considered a substantially overrated movie. I also note that in addition to the many one star reviews, there are many two star and three star reviews that also capture many of this movie's shortcomingsI found the movie dull, depressing and hard to watch. For me it was painful just wishing it would end quickly. Fortunately I wasted only $1.50 for a Red Box rental on this experience and did not actually buy it. I am a big Natalie Portman fan and she did a fine job with a simply awful script --but no amount of good acting by a single individual could make this a redemable movie given the awful script."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this movie. First of all, you knew at the start of the movie how it would end. Then you had to guess what was real and what was not real which seems to be the thing for movies coming out now. I didn't think there was anything deep in this movie. Would recomment you select a different movie."
3,"Aronofsky tries , unsuccessfully , to be Cronenberg","Only David Cronenberg can BE Cronenberg . Fine and interesting premise . Great cast . 2/3rds Aronofsky , 1/3rd Dave Cronenberg is a BAD and STUPID blend . What was the WRESTLER'S director thinking ? He wasn't . See it for the actors . Cassel is a wonder , as he was in the far better EASTERN PROMISES . Directed , curiously , by DAVID CRONENBERG . WOW . Some sort of new Scriptures style cinema ? You tell me ? Downer as well . Out.....Blimjo"
4,Good but Graphic,"The acting and dancing is exceptional, but there were several unnecessarily graphic sex scenes that I would have preferred not to see."
1,The worst movie ever!!!,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It was all I could do to stay awake during the entire first half things were moving so slow. The rest of it was just plain strange. Don't waste your money. If you must watch it, wait until it comes on free TV."
2,Did Not Live Up To The Hype,"I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, but I don't get it. Yes, the acting was good, but the story was not very engaging. Once the movie was over I didn't really give the movie a second thought. Very forgetable."
3,Immortal Russian Classic,"A simplistic description of a script is a psychotic breakdown same gender attracted ballerina suffered while switching between opposite characters-White and Black Swans in by-this-movie-once-again-glorified Tchaikovsky's Russian ballet ""Swan Lake"".However, behind the scenes New York environment depicted is crucial to gain a depth of delusive imaginary sustaining the tale screened.To a reviewer's opinion, ninety-nine percent of viewer's attraction this work generates is owned to actress Portman's performing incredible."
3,solid but overrated,"thought the casting was great. the actors/actresses fit their roles. movie had great direction and meaning. solid on every front but it is overrated. i did not see anything special, amazing or different about this film for it to garnish so many Oscar nomination, including best actress.another gripe about this film is: how many times can you possibly watch portman go crazy ? its a one time watch, like most Darren Aronofsky films. he does do terrific work, films that hit close to home. explores the concepts of needs, wants, obsessions and desire as well as anybeautifully done, worth watching but seriously, don't get hopes up too high. Oscar films aren't always necessarily that 4 star film critics rave aboutp.s. for those who did love this film and want to own it. the black/red cover from target is pretty sweet and comes with a dvd copy. you can always sell the dvd or/and digital copy and keep the blu ray and pay less"
2,Dancing with the stars,"There was so much ballet in this movies, and I don't like ballet, that the main theme of insanity of the main actress was completely skimmed over until the last suicidal act. This film could have been great with much more focus on the main actress and her unbalanced mother. Portman is an average actress who can dance ballet but I never really connected with her as a terribly unbalanced, haunted young woman that was striving for perfection. The ending was to much on the theme of Romeo and Juliet without Romeo."
5,AMAZING!!!,"This was one of Natalie Portman's BEST films! She truly deserves an Oscar for this role! My friends and I absolutely loved this movie! It was thrilling, sensual, funny & straight up awesome! I give this 5 stars!Good job Natalie!!"
2,Black Swan Disappointment,"The story line was interesting. The dancing SUPERB thanks to the brilliance of Sarah Lane, soloist for the ABT. Unfortunately, Ms. Portman overacted every scene and left me rolling my eyes and sighing in exasperation.Ms. Lane...You get 5 stars."
1,Psycho Dancer Needs an Orgasm,"If you're looking for lesbian sex between two known actors, then this film has what you want. If you're looking for a good film, look elsewhere. The story fails to explain anything relevant other than to suggest that to dance well, ballerinas need to have an orgasm. To be fair, this is the symbol of Natalie's frustrations and struggle to rise above being a child and become an adult but to also be fair, its hard to see the point. The psychotic elements are typical and don't follow much of a theme and the overall script is purely abysmal.Further, the actual dancing is minimal, especially considering it is supposed to be a key part of the storyline.My suggestion is that if you want porn, buy real porn. Otherwise, recognize that the best part of the film is Natalie's eye makeup in the end."
2,Bad choice,"After all the hype, I was sorely disappointed in this film. Pointless, sad movie. I don't think it's watchable at any time."
4,masterful homage,"a masterful homage to the sleazy psycho-sexual blood horror flicks of the 60's and 70's, elevating the genre to high art."
2,Overrated Film and Star,"'Black Swan' received good reviews, but disappoints on watching. I found Natalie Portman overacting each scene. The story of a young, ambitious dancer losing touch with reality is fundamentally terrific, and I would have loved to see a decent rendition of it. Measured against other movies with a similar theme, such as 'American Psycho' or the masterpiece 'Pi,' 'Black Swan' has little to offer."
3,weird swan,I think the actors in this movie were great. However I don't even know where to begin in describing how strange and creepy this film is. I have only watched it once after I bought it and once was enough. It is quite intense at times and slightly confusing at others. I hate to be a spoiler so I won't give away too much as there is already a good description next to the product picture. It is one of the better psychological thrillers out there but not my cup of tea.
1,Don't waste your money buying it and you won't waste your time watching it.,"I love the music Swan Lake, but I have never seen the ballet Swan Lake. The technical quality of the dvd is fine, but this movie is pathetic. I don't normally do reviews, but I urge you to ask some people who have similar tastes in movies to your's who have seen it before you buy this dvd."
4,Interesting,"I had seen the movie a few times before. What I would suggest is to read a synopsis online about it first, about it meaning and about all the symbolism behind the scence even if the website has a spoiler alert read it. Then u will understand and apprieciate the meaning behind fame and glory in the sence that its not necessarily the artist alone that can destroy themselves but how other are know contributors to there downfall. However with out reading up about it initially you would not get this from the movie so I think that the director ir whoever didnt depict its measn in a movie well enough to get it the first time has nothing to do with being intelectual."
2,Black Swan Dive,"Watching Natalie Portman in Black Swan was a nail biter. At times, I had to turn my face away from the action. I was expecting, from other reviews and all of the awards it had garnered, a classic the likes of The Red Shoes or The Turning Point; however, it is more action thriller than lush balletic drama full of wonderful dance scenes. Dance fans should beware and save their money."
4,I liked it - but it was strange,"It was definately in interesting movie. Winona Ryder was in it for like 6 seconds. The movie goes back and forth a lot, so you aren't really sure what's real. However, you are seeing everything from Nina's (Portman) perspective, so I guess it makes sense since she's falls into this black swan role. Overall, it was worth watching once - but I can't say i'd watch it again."
5,#8 Film of 2010 Black Swan,"Length:: 2:53 MinsThis is the start of a movie review revelation I like to call THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. My name is Nathan Ligon at Shot & Cut Films and I will be introducing an online Review Program that will change the face of how we view critique in film. This will be a program for lovers of both the old school Siskel & Ebert and the new school Rotten Tomatoes Show. The show will be online in it's full production value in several months but, i am rolling out the concept piece by piece starting with the Best and Worst of 2010. If you enjoy and want more please send me an email at nathan@oakviewprocessing.com."
3,I expected for acting less porn...,"I did not see this when it came out. With all the recognition it received I expected more. It seemed very predictable to me . Acting was good and dancing was good, but really, do really have to be literarily in people's faces and laps to get a sex scene across. And do we really have to make 50% or more of the story about sex when it's not a porn film. God America , and Hollywood , grow up! We've seen it all and do we really have to keep acting like 6 year olds over a dirty word and act like the most base act in nature is the big attraction we center are life's around and the media persists on using as its main ploy to sell us watered down crap ( entertainment) without a well written sentence or original story line.Natalie Portman always a pro, film good but not great and certainly not a film for the ages or the under aged ."
1,Huh!,This movie was so bad my wife and I were stunned. We have seen low budget horror that makes more sense.
2,30 User Internet Pan/Tilt Color Camera,"Probably one of the worst items I have ever purchased as far as understanding an undersized manual. Also, no where in the purchase process did I see a router was required. I have had a ""computer whiz"" trying to get it on-line and we still do not have it accomplished. It needs to be designed with simple users in mind."
3,Smaller than expected,"Good product, easy to activate, cold quickly, lasts 10-15 minutes. I have ordered packs before that were larger and better for large areas (like back and shoulders) but these are good for smaller areas."
3,"Good quality, too small","These cold packs work well functionally, but take note they really are too small. Generally cooling an injured body part takes more volume to effectively work than these packs provide at this size. Order larger packs instead."
1,"Country of Origin is China, not USA",I bought these because I was looking for ice pack made in the USA. The product description indicated they are from the USA. Imagine my surprise to see Made in China clearly on the box when it arrived.It also appears I can't even return it because it's a hazardous or flammable material.
2,Works only for a short period,"Recently used on jammed finger... Followed the directions each time, squeeze pop the liquid, shake to mix and apply. Mixtures turns cold quickly but not as cold as ice. I guess cold enough to be affective but the problem is the pack warms up after only a few minutes. After 3 to 4 mins the pack feels like it's filled with cool water from the faucet.I would not recommend this product or buy again under any condition."
4,"Works well - just not very long. Also, some are HARD to activate","When you are able to activate them (some 'pop' easily, other bags are darn near impossible to get the inner packet to pop), they work decently. Do not expect them to last very long ---- about 5 minutes is all I seem to get out of them. Would I buy them again? Perhaps. I would definitely have to look at other variations of this product and see what the reviews said."
1,Dynarex Instant Cold Pack,The product did not work well. It does not get very cold and does not stay cold for a long time. I used other instant ice products that work much better. Pay more money and get a better product.
2,Loved it/hated it!,"This is a great book for beginners! I love the easy reading and pages showing the signs.HOWEVER, when the publisher put this book in print, perhaps they didn't realize that the picture of the sign and the words on how to do the sign should be on the same page. I spent too much time flipping pages. When showing my daughter picture of the sign, I had to flip to the page before or after to read on how to form and do the sign. TOO MUCH WORK. I now have a sign language dictionary.But a good first book to start with...just a lot of work to read and look at picture. FLIP FLIP FLIP FLIP..."
2,very short,"By the book description, I was expecting many more signs. Instead I got about 10 basic signs and a lot of talk about how signing is great for you and your family. I know that already... It's why I bought the book."
2,Chitty bang chitty chitty bang bang..,"Price is right, but you do get what you pay for. The mask is great for giving you some camo stealth effect but the thing I did not like about this mask is it is paper thin and when I say paper thin I do mean paper thin.. If you were to catch this on a branch it would tear it with ease, when you are putting it on, it is so thin that you can see through it with no problem.. If you are wanting this to help keep warm, I suggest getting a more expensive heavy duty mask because this would not keep you even slightly warm.."
5,Wonderful,I ordered this for my husband for his birthday and he loved it. It is light and comfortable and just what I expected it to be.
3,If Only I Were A True Connoisseur,"I think I got it mostly to feel more sophisticated, because Salvador Dali is never an artist that I (or possibly anyone) have ever understood. It's a great book and covers a multitude of his paintings and what his life was like at that particular time, and what many of the symbols could mean.It's a good coffee table book, but I've never really read it with much depth. Quite honestly his art disturbs me, so I can only look at his art for so long before I get squeamish.Good for art history book collectors, or true art connoisseurs."
5,Another by the book...,It was shipped within 24-48 hours. The item came new. I cannot complain. I will buy again from this seller.
4,Works great with some limitations,"I have had this mower three years. For the most part I agree with D. Sell ""d0cdave' review, but add the following comments to his review:Pros: Light weight, easy to manouver.Very easy to adjust cutting hight.Cons: I was very disappointed with its cutting & bagging performance the1st year I had it. The original blade did not seem very sharp.After a year of mowing I got it professionally sharpened - it cameback with a knife sharp edge which made a huge difference.I find the edging attachment to be awkward, not worth the effortmuch of the time.I would look closely at the more highly rated Black & Decker battery model before repurchasing another Newton"
3,"Great tea, Cheap Box",Great tasting Organic tea.I have used Numi for a while so i knew what i was getting.but i was very disappointed with the box quality. in the picture it looks sleek and smooth but the one i got seemed unfinished.the color is faded out and it seems they never been sanded.i got my finger hurt when i slid my hand on the top. what a cheap box from such a great company....
1,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx,Never received book from Amazon. Contacted American Express to reverse charges. Will not order from Amazon again.
3,"Timid, Old-Fashioned Piano Trios Adequately Played","Alexander Grechaninov (1864-1956) was a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakoff whose two piano trios, although written in the 20th century (1906 and 1931), could have been written a good forty years earlier. They are neatly constructed, melodically undistinguished, and truthfully rather boring and complacent. These performances by violinist Viktor Simcisko, cellist Juraj Alexander and pianist Daniela Ruso, recorded in 1993, are adequate but don't make the case for these works that the later recording by the Bekova Sister doesGrechaninov: Piano Trios Nos. 1 & 2."
5,FAshion FUN,"i'm very pleased with this product. i purchased it for my daughter and she LOVES it. the book is well made and contains all necessary supplies to create fun fashion pics. it also allows girls to play with make up colors according to eye color, face shape, or skin tone etc... on these special face/drawing papers..."
1,Problem with using joysticks,If you intend to use a joystick with this game please go to the Darkstar One website and look in their forums for all of the complaints about joysticks not operating correctly before you spend your money. The main problem is that the axis are reversed (and cannot be un-reversed) which (at least for me) renders that game unplayable. If you use a keyboard for flight/space sims the game should be playable. This is another example of an unfinished product being rushed to market with major issues still unresolved.
5,Works Great,"I had my doubts but once I got it up and going, it fit great and works great. Magnets click in place. I give it a 5 star review."
4,Too wide,The product is really very good and easy to install. The thing is that it was wider than 34 and it didn't fit well.
4,"Whew, JUST what we needed","I live in a rental and the sliding door never came with a screen. Your choice is to leave it open and have bugs in your house, or just close it and swelter in the heat (tho, living in the Northwest ""heat"" is relative).This screen is GREAT and easy to install. I have dogs and they have learned very quickly how to get in and out. The price is so reasonable. I think maybe I should order another just in case this one comes to some harm, from the dogs. If and when it ever DOES get really warm, I'll be loving the breeze coming from the back through our new screen. Great product. Arrived really quickly too."
3,Not exactly as advertised for homes,"I would use it for a camper perhaps but does not fit door well, leaving gaps in bottom. Handy when going in and out with my hands full (like when grilling). Flaps do not always close securely. Will just have to get a regular screen door."
2,Does not meet expectations.,"While the screen does do what it says it does, the other 1 and 2 star reviews are pretty spot on. The magnets do not hold very well and the screen itself leaves gaps on the side and down the middle where bugs can get in. The Velcro that holds the sides to the door jamb wears out and loses its adhesiveness and the bar that holds the screen will have to be retightened on a regular basis. While it does allow for the dog and the kids to come as they go, you had better hope that they go right through the middle. My dog ran after a squirrel and went right through the screen putting a big hole in it. How big is the dog you wonder... around 30 lbs. While the screen does work, it is not the best quality. I would rather make one myself with pet screen and better magnets."
1,it's crap!!!,too much trouble for what little it does...not worth the money...cheaply made and does not live up to what the ad states it will!!!
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"When I first opened my box, I was disappointed that the weight of the screen was not heavier, but it seemed that it would work perfectly. Within a week, one inside edge of the center began to ravel, and now in the third week, the rod will not lock and stay up. I took it down this weekend and called Stacks & Stacks. They were very nice and agreed to send a replacment immediately. I'm hoping the next one is better."
4,Meets expectations,"Very easy to install. Opening is pretty low so if you are on the taller side, you may have to duck to go through, even in a normal sized doorway. Magnetic closures only work on their own half the time, otherwise need to be guided into place. Though the screen fits pretty well in our doorway, there are still gaps at the bottom, so crawling bugs could still easily get in. We are more using it for keeping mosquitos out, and it seems to work well for that. It's a bit annoying to go through the screen if your hands are full, but doable. Works well for our needs being that we won't be living here for more than a year, but if you are in a more permanent living situation, you'd be better off installing a real screen door. As noted by another reviewer, the screen is a very dark color and will make your door look darker from outside. No problems with the screen falling.. seems fairly secure."
4,Adequate & Easy to Install,"Just purchased this last week and installed it the next day. Very simple installation and a good fit. It does what it says it does and is of adequate quality. Its worth the money, but my comments are:- Should have more velcro on the sides to make sure the sides of the screen don't become detached- Should have more magnets in the middle to make sure it snaps back into place (only 2 sets of magnets)- The bottom magnets aren't too strong and don't snap into place unless they gently touch together- Top opening is a little narrow"
1,Very bad product,"I tried to install, which was relatively easy. But, I paid much more for this product than others on the market, thinking that it would be better quality. The magnets barely stick, the opening is not really wide enough to navigate through. This is a rip-off. They should be ashamed to sell this thing for the price. It doesn't work, and I'm not sure how it's been rated so well, unless their own employees were forced to buy and rate it highly.I'm trying to pack it back up to see if I can get a refund, but it will likely be doubtful. I""m going to go and buy the cheaper one. It can't possibly be any worse than this.For the price you'd think they'd at least invest in more than two magnets, and that the magnets would at least be powerful enough to actually close the darn thing."
4,Very easy to install,"I just received this product today and installed it immediately in about five minutes. It fits my sliding door perfectly and seems to be doing the job so far. Allow sufficient time for shipping though, it was shipped via Fedex smartpost and took about 11 days to arrive with free super saver shipping.Bug Off 34 by 79 Instant Screen, Fits Some Single Doors, Mobile Homes"
5,"Great, Easy to Install Screen!","We have French Doors in our livingroom and miss out on any evening breeze that passes our way. My husband and I decided to look into these new, easy to install screens and found there are many on the market. We checked Amazon and found Bug Off to have the best rating. We ordered a 60"" by 80"" screen and received it quickly. I was able to install it myself as my husband looked on, doubtful I could put it up alone. I had it up in about 15 minutes and immediately felt the breeze make its wasy into the livingroom. Our puppy thought it was the best thing to happen and made her way out immediately. Our bigger, older dog is afraid to go through it. This screen is study, easy to use and closes shut pretty well. We've had it up for two weeks and so far, very good!"
2,did not fit my door,"This screen does not cover my door, I measured the door again once I received the product to make sure I ordered the right size. I'm not sure if they sent the wrong size by accident or if sizing is off."
4,It's so nice to be able to leave the french doors open,"It's a good quality product. I was able to set it up in a few minutes. I like the product. My only complaint is that it is a little short to reach all the way to the floor. If it is a bit longer, I will be able leave the door open at night as well."
5,No More Bugs,"If you have dogs that like to go in and out and bring the little flying things from outdoors inside, then this is the best invention I have seen at an unbelievable reasonable price. And, it works great with our oddly sized french doors. It even stands up to the rigors of my 90 lb doberman who goes flying through it on a regular basis. It's virtually indestructible and has made a huge difference for our home. Highly recommended!"
3,Fairly good product but...,"For the money it might be a good purchase for you. We had to adjust it when we went thru to get it to close. Our 2 dogs were afraid of it and wouldn't go thru it so we ended up sending it back and received a prompt refund. I would still recommend this product and the seller as it does do what it advertises except maybe for the ""hands-free"" part. Of course it's possible that maybe we didn't install it correctly. If you are wanting a product like this, I'd say give it a try. It's not like the one that you see on TV but overall it's alot less money."
5,An amazing solution for a low tech problem.,The need to let air in while keeping bugs out resulted in the screen door that swings on a hinge and takes up a significant amount of space as it is opened.Our back patio could not support the installation of a traditional screen door.The walk-thru screen is a perfect solution for a screen with very little impact on the surrounding area.It is easy to install and easy to remove.We leave it up as much as possible.It also serves as a doggie-door so your pets can go in and out at will.I highly recommend this product.
4,such a great product!,"i bought this product because i have friends who bought a similar one from skymall and paid a fortune. it works very well. It offers the house a cool breeze without the bugs. I have a lab that will occasionally jump against the door when it is shut and the screen is up and his claws have not blemished the screen! the only negative issue i had is the adhesive tape that attaches the bottom of the screen to the house is terrible. make sure you adhere the tape to a clean surface because if you have to move it, the tape will lose it's stickiness."
4,I was not too sure whether to buy this.....,"...but I am very pleased with the screen. With pets and young children around we are in and out all the time and this screen makes life so much easier and quicker. No more putting trays down to slide open the screen, then slide it closed again. You breeze on through and just give a little back heel to close the screen again. The dog pushes through the botttom so it stays closed. Easy to install. All in all a good purchase and I would buy another."
1,very flimsy and does not fit right,I really wish I wouldn't have purchased this product; it is very flimsy and does not fit in the door properly. It is not secure at all and falls or feels like it is going to everytime you go through it.
1,I am using it but needs a lot of fixing,"The service was very good as I had never been disapointed using Amazon the delivery was fast, the instalation very easy but the product does not work property without fixing first it keep on coming down every time so I have to put a hook on top to keep it on place. Second I have to nail the velcro to the frame and third every time the dogs go trough it the magnets never come together so I have to pin the to pieces with clothes pins, after that It gives me some protection for the flies but sometimes even with the pins the 2 magnets on the top do not come together and still have to doing by hand. The idea of leave the door open while the dogs are home alone is still just an idea."
2,Not very good..,"This product was very disappointing, and I had such high hopes for it. Not worth the cost and trouble to get."
5,Great product,"When I decided to buy this product was very doubtful of its effectiveness because I've seen similar products in TV commercial or magazines. But I considered the price and I have to say I do not regret my purchase. It is important and essential to take the right measures of the door to handle the job. It doesn't have to fit perfectly, gotta have space for flexibility of the net because if its too tight will casue trouble to open it.The materials are of excellent quality and looks that are durable.I recommend this product without any doubt."
2,"Difficult to fit, and doesn't stay closed","I was a little disappointed with this product, having researched similar items for a few hours this came up well. However, it was harder than I'd expected to fit, and did not close or fit as closely as the reviews suggested. Make sure you check the size of your door, as slightly too big or small and this will disappoint."
3,Wanted to love this...,"but... I don't quite love it.Short story, the screen swings ""ok"" when you are heading outside. When you head inside, the screen rubs on the threshold of the door, and does not close properly. Also, I have a steel door, so sometimes the magnets will just stick to the door instead of closing. And as a final reason for the 3 star score, on a 36 inch door, the gap at the top narrows so you have to turn your shoulders to get through. No big deal, until you are carrying a tray of food back and forth to the grill.Best parts of this product, it is pretty well made. It does not look like a piece of junk.But it just functions ""ok"". I'll keep it."
4,Instant screen,"This product is easy to instal and easy to use. It is not perfect, but is far better than the sliding screen door we had"
3,"Quick and Easy, A reasonable Option","This screen installed easily, and does work pretty good for its intended purpose. The magnets don't always close, sometimes they need to be 'encouraged' to close completely. Also, some crawling bugs will still creep in under the screen. Another word of caution: this screen is advertised to let your dog/cat/kids out, but will also let random neightborhood cats in as well... just be forewarned!"
3,Could be Better,"First off Mark John Sternal is a very good instructor and does teach in a real basic way and uses as very simple style of playing. I don't feel the material in this DVD is worth the $8.00 I paid unlike the Easy Metal Guitar DVD, but on that note it would have been a better buy to have had the material on the Easy Guitar tricks DVD included with or on the Easy Metal Guitar DVD. Also what is lacking on both DVD's is a downloadable PDF file of the riffs. In order to practice the riffs over and over you have to watch the DVD's over and over. The one really good thing I like about both DVD's is how you can work through the material at a slow, medium and fast pace. I was also hoping to learn how to do a unison bend as I seem to have a hard time with that, but he did not demonstrate that. I did like the taping material. So I give the DVD 3 stars."
2,Still waiting for my refund. Not very dependable.,"Seller very hard to reach. They take their time to answer if ever. They have the item back several weeks and Ia am still waiting for my refund.Their specs of the item was incorrect on line therefore, I ordered. When received it was not what I wanted."
3,Not so good,"This is not the product you want to have, you will be better off getting pressure control emitters from home depot/lowels for same price and that works 100% better than these."
3,It is a nice looking fan.,I think the fan is nice looking but it makes a clicking noise on 3. Time will tell how it holds up.
2,Not the right stuff,"This cable is narrower than standard RG6. I used Paladin crimps with bad results then wrapped the cable with electrical tape to get a better hold but it still didn't work all that well. The other problem I had was with signal noise. I ran this thro PVC piping above drop sealing and not near electrical lines (60ft ish). The signal I received caused massive problems with my Digital cable; pretty much making it unbearable to watch. I still have it running the Cable modem with no problems (20ft ish). I'm handy enough to run the line but I do not know why this cable was so bad or even if I'm just not using it right. Either way 2 stars for either being bad cable or not having the right description from the seller; RG6 is a pretty basic and doesn't hint at the thinner cabling or anything else none standard on this. If I used this stuff wrongly by all means let me know, I'd still like to get my moneys worth."
3,Alt. Horror,"I got this decent horror flick in a package of 4 DVDs for one low price, which I couldn't find listed here on Amazon the four of them together. Someone throws a bachelor party with (vampire) strippers. Most of the film is either the stripping scenes or the vampires' body count. Not bad though for horror enthusiats."
5,Great!!!,If you are looking to brush up on your music history get this DVD. I learned so much about them. The DVD is really complete. I learned that Paul Williams actually had a real nice voice. I am looking forward to owning more music DVDs to catch up on my history.
5,The Best of the Temptations-1965-1972,"This DVD is a composite of several of the ""hits"" that this very talented group recorded. Narrated by the only living member of the original group, he gives a lot of insight into the dynamics of the group. This is played out in a few scenes in which the group is practicing for a performance. But not to worry, all songs are complete.In the early days of the group, the shows are in black and white; but as time goes on, they're in color. The group was always well dressed for their performances. They were a multitalented group who put on very entertaining shows. Their dance routines were very well choreographed and very suitable to the group. The DVD also shows the changes in singers, but, as a group, they were still on top.I enjoyed this DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone who may be a fan of the Temptations!"
5,Temptations - 5 Stars !!,"Awesome, Awesome. It is so great to actually see the Temptations perform from their beginnings in Detroit. It would have been nice to have Barry Gordy also as part of the interview but it does not take away from the DVD. Excellent."
2,A HOMOPHOBE TACKLES LESBIAN HEROINES,"Writing about Una Troubridge, Hall's lover, Lovat Dickson avows, ""Like all neurotics she was an egomaniac."" Una's lesbian leanings, according to Dickson, were responsible for her husband's faulty military decisions which supposedly helped prolong World War II, angered Churchill, and cost many lives.One could go on and on with this bitchy man's distortions and witch-doctor analyses, but life is short and getting shorter. The now resoundingly dead Dickson distorts history and defames Hall and her lovers because homosexuality makes him greatly uncomfortable. (He calls it ""deviant nature."")Dickson also is not a great fan of ""Well of Loneliness,"" so why write this biography? you might ask.Believe it or not, he claims to have become a friend of Una's and was even in her will. With friends like this,enemies are a blessing.So if you are going to read only one biography on Hall, avoid this one by all means. Try ""Our Three Selves"" instead."
1,Schocking bad!,"This product makes me regret buying DVD's online.Video quality = bad, 4:3 SD caption of the games and trainings. The commentator on the DVD has an awful English accent. The structure of the material is boring and repeated, You will see a short summary of what the team have done (training/game) with a hard voice-over of the annoying English commentator. This is not an official FC Barcelona product, it's an amateur release of Barcelona's games.If you are an FC Barcelona fan, I recommend you buying FC Barcelona Champions Of Europe 2006 2-Disc DVD and FC Barcelona-Mas Que un Club, both have a professional quality of video and sound.I wished I could rate this product 0 star, but it gets 1 for capturing goals and games (in the worst quality)."
4,Handy and compact,"I bought this tripod specifically for its size to have as a travel companion on a recent long-term trip, and it fit the bill nicely. Although I found it annoying not to have a quick release plate, my frustrations were overridden by its overall compactness, lightness and impressive strength. I used my heavy 80-200/2.8 (light wind) for exposures up to 30 seconds and the images were still tack sharp. Impressive performer."
3,"Sensor not effective, looks good","Sensor not effective, it is not reliable, sometimes it works, sometimes does not.The looks is good. I kept it because of the look, if I have to trigger it on, I keep my hands on the sensor and it turns on :)"
1,Think TWICE before buying the product and then.... DON'T.,"When mounted on our porch, this light is very visually appealing. In use however... its shortcomings become quickly apparent.IT DOESN'T FUNCTION PROPERLY.Regardless of the settings used, there are many nights when the light doesn't sense any motion and won't come on. On other evenings, it never turns off.This morning, it's still on at 11:15 AM, even though the sun is shining brilliantly outside.The light sensor doesn't work properly, the light timer doesn't work properly and the motion sensor and sensitivity controls are also defective.This weekend, I'll be replacing it with something from Home Depot or Lowes."
5,Lectures on Modules and Rings,Very well written and comprehensive treatise of the subject with a lot of illustrative examples.Of value not only to those working in algebraic domains but also to students and researchers in analysis
2,Eh.,"I bought this because we had been in Maui and missed the amazing Haleakala sunrise that everyone raved about. This video was ok, but the script was a little tedious and it looped the same footage over and over again. It would have been much better if they'd had more footage. I paid only half price and I still felt I didn't get my money's worth! Maybe my expectations were too high."
3,Famous,I just acted Salieri in Amadeus. Wanted to hear his music. Easy to see why Mozart was far superior composer
1,Not what I was looking for...,"I was looking for a more traditional versions of the songs....However, I have purchased many WOW CD products and love the CDs."
2,New Mom from Florida,"I agree 100% with ""A toy enthusiast's"" 12/9/02 review dated December 9, 2002.....Although the song selection and overall idea of children singing are good, the CD is extremely annoying because the children sing in ""Little-Rascals-Alfalfa-like"" voices, often with manufactured-sounding speech impediments."
4,Still good,"Just finished read Palm version of the book (Amazon shipping to Israel is soooooooooooooo expensive...).I am long time Lois fan - red all her books, and in love with most of them, but in last years she slowed down a bit...Diplomatic Immunity and Hallowed Hunt are still very good reading, but after Civil Campain and Chalion/Paladin one expects better...Hallowed Hunt is just not in the same league - characters are shallow, plot seems same - unwilling hero is twarted by gods to do some job connected to old times... I also had this feeling that I am into Robin Hobbs Assasin series all over again (animal magic etc.)Still, as mentioned one of reviewers before, Lois is great writer and pages (well, screens in my case) turn fast and I liked my reading. And now I am free to re-read Chalion again:) (20th time, something like that...)"
3,the hollowed hunt,Not really connected to the first two books. I was rather disapointed as it seems to be presented as a third book in a trilogy and it's got nothing to do with the first two books. The story as a stand alone was also nowhere near the quality of the other two books.
5,Real English Computer Talk,"Finally a book in real English that uses concrete words to explain computer concepts. Excellent material on MVS giving both CLEAR overview and detail. Excellent insight on connectivity problems/options and what vendors' products address which problems. If you like books that BUILD ON CONCRETE CONCEPTS and are arranged in an orderly, hierarchial fashion, this is the book.Oh, did I mention the content is impecable? Old MVS guys? Gotta have this one."
5,NOBODY DOES IT BETTER,"UWF is a compilation of new stuff, by old reliables. It is a collaboration of funk heavyweights, showing how it should be done. These old faithfuls show that NOBODY DOES IT BETTER,than the tried and tested ones. A funk collectors gem, will make a nice conversation piece, especially with new funkateers."
3,I like the design,These are really light and a little to flexible (need to be stiffer to hold in place better)..but do their job.
5,"Goodbye Tide, hello bioclean","I purchased this based on reviews and I'm very pleased with the results. It may seem pricey but, unlike the other so called concentrated detergents, you really do only use 2 tablespoons per load. (I use 1/2 to 1 TBS more for extra large loads in my very hard water.) It cleans better than any other laundry soap I've tried and the smell is just clean and fresh. I highly recommend this product whether you want to be 'green"" or not because it WORKS -- better than the commercialized stuff with all the additives. What more could you ask for?"
1,This is a horrible textbook,"I am on amazon right now because I need to find a new textbook that is worth reading for my inorganic chemistry course. This book is garbage, it reads like an encyclopedia that was written by someone who already knows inorganic chemistry inside and out for someone who already knows inorganic chemistry inside and out. I had no idea the book was filled with errors because the book does such a bad job of explaining inorganic chemistry that I don't know what is being talked about most of the time. Avoid this book and if you can name a better inorganic chemistry textbook let me know."
3,list of alternative titles for inorganic chemistry,"wow, I see lots of people don't like Atkins. Read my listmania list (""fundamentals of inorganic chemistry"") for other titles worth considering and then do yourself a favor and buy Concise Inorganic Chemistry by J.D. Lee - not many people are aware of this fine book.If looking for a decent book on symmetry, group theory check out my ""symmetry and group theory for chemistry students"" list. These titles are for students - i.e. not designed to impress the professoriate."
3,Too Political,"I have only read half-way through it because it got too political to follow through with, all thier other books are great, so read those first!"
4,Peopie of the Raven,"I would recommend "" People of the Raven "" to any person who has read any of the ""First North American"" series of books.It adds to the the ongoing story that the Husband and Wife team of Gear and Gear have written."
3,'Linux Device Drivers' is Better,"Despite its size, this book has various defects.First of all, while it covers the memory systems with agreat amount of detail, the file system and the descriptionof the actual kernel are vague.Second, the index and table of contents make it quitedifficult to find your way around the book. As a ruleof thumb, an index should have two entries per page oftext. This book falls way short of that.I bought this book as part of a kernel programming class,and was falling behind until I got a copy of the other book:http://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Drivers-Jonathan-Corbet/dp/0596005903"
2,Words can't describe this mess......,"If any of you are familiar with Larry Buchanan(from MST3K for starters),then you know he did Attack of the the Eye Creatures,but these 2 films are just as bad,if not worse(if that's possible!).The first movie ""It's Alive!"" only has 2 scenes of the monster and that's it! The flashback is way too long and could've been summed up in 2 sentences at least.The second feature is a little better and the creature you see alot more,but still,there are no thrills,no suspense-nothing!!..The best way to view these films is to hand these over to MST3K and let them do the rest!!!...Bad movies? Sure,but no fun at all to sit through......."
5,Best show around!,How refreshing that these guys are actually doing something fun and educational and being really nice to the local people they visit as well.I think the sequel is coming out soon and it is on the top of our family's xmas list!
1,Spoiled Rich Brats,"I'm an avid motorcyclist and adventure tourer so I was very excited to see this film. I couldn't get past the first 45 minutes or so. These rich, spoiled pampered brats are simply unreal. the first thing they do when the decide to travel around the world? RENT an office and HIRE staff! I don't know about you but the first thing I'd do is start eating top ramen and figuring out what to sell to finance the trip!Blech."
5,Best Documentary Series Ever!,"While watching T.V. late one night, I stumbled upon this documentary. I was immediately hooked. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves to travel or would like to watch a real adventure for a change."
3,Good but a bit too long,This movie will give you a chance to see places you may otherwise never see and shows how much of a hastle it is to travel in some other countries. Be prepared to watch a little at a time since it is a long flick.
3,Too many F-words,"I enjoyed the round-the-world trip because I am a motorcyclist, my wife my passenger. However, the heroes seemed to whine a lot when things went wrong, which was several times per episode. Then the F-word came out, too often for my taste. I would not recommend this for kids or families, just die-hard bikers who want to see what riders go through on the far side of the globe."
4,Fun Camera!,"The holga is a pretty cool way to experiment with 120mm film, also a significantly less expensive way. That being said the pictures are obviously not going to be super high quality. I like it because i do my own printing and it's fun to play with the images. If you're looking for a camera that takes excellent pictures, this isn't the camera. Also if you do not do your own printing and developing, 120 film can be very expensive to have developed and printed if you can even find a place that will do it. Any good photo lab will do it for you, however i don't think any 1 hour photo places will. Overall, it's a fun camera and for 30 bucks there's not much to complain about, sometimes you even get a pretty cool shot, but don't expect pro quality."
5,just what i expected,"I guess it's just that -- just what I expected. I love the Holga, but it's for fun and the unexpected, doesn't serve the same purpose as my Nikon D50. :)"
2,"Lovely music, but poor cd product","After hearing a song of the Mediaeval Baebes on radio I wanted to hear more. I was not disappointed.Most of songs on the 'Best Of' cd are lovely, enchanting and at times haunting. They transport you back in time to some Medieval village when life was simple, more elemental. The harmony of the Baebes voices is tastefully arranged and executed. Instruments of the period were used and sparsely at that.On the whole, interesting listening but not something I play very often.My only gripe is that the cd was produced with some miscalculation resulting in songs starting and ending mid-track! (From track 6 onward.) This means you have to listen to the tracks in order, from start to finish. If you skip to a later song, you arrive mid-song. This is very annoying and detracts from the enjoyment of the cd. What a pity. (I'd listen to the tracks at a music shop before buying to make sure all is in order.)Let the music be medieval, not the cd technology."
3,History of the Bartholomew Family,This 2 volume collection reads like bible. It is filled with who begat who. it is hard to find information for my branch of the Bartholomew family. Needs updating for 20th century additions
4,This might be the first book you will want to pick up,"4 1/2 stars!!Susan is candid and honest about her journey through autism. I appreciated the stages of discovery she went through. If anyone has just received a diagnosis of autism in the family, I would highly recommend reading Susan's book...finally a book about making peace, not war, with autism."
5,One of the best voices in Bluegrass.,"This is a great album. Ronnie does equal justice to traditional, rousing bluegrass songs (Will You Be Lonesme, Too; Nine Pound Hammer) and to the soft ballads (The Healing Kind, If It's Only Pretend). His distinctive voice is one of the best in bluegrass music today and has earned him male vocalist of the year awards. On this album he is joined by the likes of Tony Rice, Sammy Sheelor, and Alison Kraus. I highly recommend it."
5,My cat loved it!,"I got this for my cat and she loves it. I thought she would get bored with it, but she has yet to be tired of it."
3,Great Thin Watch,"This brand of watch is hit or miss, sometimes you get a great one that is truly waterproof, and has a battery that will last several years. This one is a semi good watch, it is very thin, stylish, and waterproof. The only thing I don't like is the gold plating on this watch will come off within a few days of wearing it. I could take my fingernail and scrape it off. If it wasn't for that I'd give it four stars. I used to have one without the gold, and it was great, lasted forever, but unfortunately it looks as if that one is no longer available."
4,Magical Memories,"I truely enjoyed this book. But what I think that made it so was because I read the two books that preceeded this one, Magical Moments and The Wedding Spell. Only by reading these books can you fully enjoy this story of love, magic and trust. True this book didn't have as much humor that I normally enjoy but it had a good story to tell. I liked seeing Tempest as a woman as well as a powerful witch. And Micheal seaching and struggling to understand how his past life intertwine with the life he has choosen now. I would recommed this book but first you must read the others to appreciate it. I'm looking for the next book that follows which was hinted at in the end."
2,Useful book but not up-to-date,"Honestly I am rather disappointed with this book. Though the title sounds great, ""The Origin and Evolution of Religion"", the treatment of the subject matter is limited and has not taken into consideration many of the new developments in the field. This is perhaps the biggest drawback of the book. Nevertheless it is a useful book to trace the origin of religion. I would give the book two stars out of five, if I am permitted to rate it.I could not trace the year of publication of the book. This has created problem in assessing how old it is.Jose Kuruvachira"
5,GOOD SPENSER MYSTERY!!,"As usual, this is a good Spenser mystery. Do read it, because the main character shows up again in a later book."
5,Exquisite!,"Spencer is truly himself here. He is hired to protect a lesbian author who is a feminist activist. Parker creates her to be a warm person if a bit prickly. This remarkable story is really more about what Heterosexual Spencer is and how he feels about this lesbian person (and oh, by the way, Susan is there and contributing to both solutions) how she must come to realize that even though he is everything she feels she must fight against, she grudgingly comes to respect and, yes, admire Spencer. It sounds hokey, and the lesbian angle is not a turn on either. But trust me, this book is special. I have come across it late, this being 1999, but it is truly a remarkable book. You cannot read it without feeling good."
5,"Spenser, woman's lib, gay rights","Robert B Parker's Spenser series have been a continued delight to me. I have most of them (many of them somewhere packed all too safely away).They read quickly for all the detail packed in each chapter.Looking for Rachel Wallace has all the standard elements of a Spenser novel; person in distress, something goes wrong, noble sleuth works tirelessly to right the wrongs.The treat comes when manly Spenser is hired to guard a lesbian woman rights advocate and the fur flies. They both learn some thing about themselves and others.The ending may rub woman's rights people the wrong way, but it makes sense, given the people and situation involved."
4,Terrific Introduction to Tom Mix,"Highlighted by spectacular Grand Canyon photography, ""Sky High"" (1922) remains among Tom Mix's finest Western adventures. Writer-director Lynn Reynolds provides the ideal vehicle for Tom's impressive riding and stunt work. In 1998, the Library of Congress added this silent gem to the National Film Registry. The Sinister Cinema DVD features a watchable 16mm print."
4,VERY CUTE!,"We're happy with this microphone, works and sounds great to us..didn't realize I'd need an amp so if you're clueless like I was, you need an amp! doh! I only gave it four stars because the mic doesn't stay in the holder well. It slips out too easily.. otherwise we love it!"
3,Microphone and stand,The piece that holds the microphone to the stand was missing from the product. We will have to call the company to get a replacement.
3,Missing Part,"she was very happy with it - but, the mic clip was missingcan I get one?Linda jagielskithanks"
1,worked for an hour,This was part of a Christmas gift for my daughter....It worked great...for an hour.....the cord broke....than I had my girl crying on my shoulder.....NOT COOL!!!!
2,Lack of better specifications,"I purchased this product and gave it to my daughter for Christmas. Going by the specifications provided, I thought the small guitar amp she already had would be sufficient. It was not and what a big disappointment! Product should include better detailed specifications."
3,Nady Center Stage,The first microphone didn't work but they sent a replacement right on before I sent the old one back. Now that was a plus in my book. Great customer service. The second on works really well and would recommend to anyone.
5,WE ALL LOVE THIS,NICE SOUNDING MICROPHONE AND INEXPENSIVE. MY DAUGHTER LOVES TO PERFORM WITH THIS-AND SO DO I.WHAT A GREAT FUN ITEM. OUR NEIGHBORS COME OVER AND HAVE JUST AS MUCH FUN AS WE DO. GREAT BUY. I DID END UP GOING TO A LOCAL MUSIC STORE AND BUYING A PEAVEY GUITAR AMP FOR THIS. (THE COST WAS ABOUT $60.00). THIS AMP SERVES OUR PURPOSE FOR THERE IS FAR MORE ELABORATE SOUND SYSTEMS OUT THERE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TAKING THE MICROPHONE AND CORD TO THE MUSIC STORE WHEN LOOKING FOR YOUR AMP. SOME AMPS SQUEAL WHEN THE MICROPHONE GETS TOO CLOSE. WHEN I BOUGHT THE MICROPHONE I DID NOT HAVE A CLUE WHAT WE NEEDED FOR SOUND. THE MUSIC STORE PEEPS WERE HELPFUL FOR I WAS COMPLETELY IN THE DARK WHEN IT CAME TO SOUND SYSTEMS.
2,Not Up to Expectations,"Considering the august reputation of the author and the number of pages, I expected a much more scholarly discussion on this subject. I was disappointed to wade through so many personal stories of her cats performing typical cat antics. While cute to a degree, less would have been an improvement so that the real topic could shine through. The title promises much more than is delivered. Too many cutsie remarks and exclamation points detract.Some fascinating information is included, and that did keep me reading, but one has to excavate for the good stuff. The interviews and descriptions of the places traveled are interesting and worth the time. Exploring some additional cultures would also have been appropriate.However, I commend Geyer for adding to the anecdotal nonfiction shelves about felines.Whle the book is not a total waste of time, be prepared for a lot of fluff if you're looking for the real story."
5,Thanks for the great statue,"A bit on the fragile side, but she arrived in one piece and is a beautiful sculpt. Thanks for creating such affordable and lovely figures."
2,Falsely-advertised,"Like the two reviewers above me, this is NOT the DVD promoted on the back. It's actually the 2007 issue in new packaging with false information. Beware."
4,The Refreshments,"I think The Replacements, out of Minnesota, are the best alternative band that ever existed. Shunning the stupid MTV philosophy of brain-drain endless video saturation, they became the BEST GROUP NOBODY EVER HEARD OF! Check out their 3 or 4 videos! Paul Westerberg is a goddamn genius (although he needs to get back to his ""Replacement"" roots!) Coincidentally, The Refreshments are the 2nd best band that ever existed. Its too bad that both groups never made it in the so-called popular music culture. But maybe that's why they are so good. The Ass Ponys are also good. Liz Phair is also really cool."
2,Second season was HORRIBLE,"The first season was soooo amazing! It was my favorite show and I couldn't wait for the second season. But it took over a year for it to come out and when it did it was awful! The characters acted like they weren't even them, the show became really stupid. Too bad, because the first season was awesome."
5,Thank You,"A marvelous film, and a gift to all of us. I've never cried at a movie before, but I had tears of sadness at one point, and tears of joy at the end. What a wonderful roller-coaster of life, all bundled up in 91 minutes. You MUST pay attention to the film, though. The storyline jumps around between four points in Jose's life, so if you leave the room, or are talking during the film, you will miss something important, and get lost. Make your popcorn before the show, tuck the kids in bed, turn off the phone, and give this film all your attention... you will become immersed in a beautiful story."
5,Great Movie!,What an enjoyable film. Bella conveys a beautiful message of love without judgments of any kind. I found the film to be very moving and positive.
5,Beautiful Movie!,"This movie is a slow pace movie that will move you. It's a beautiful story about love, loss and life."
4,I liked it anyway,"My expectations for this film were low, as most film critics said it was awful. I don't care how well intentioned film makers are if they do not know their craft.That said, I liked this movie. The lead actress did a very credible job. In its totality this movie isn't Oscar quality, nor is it as good as Arranged, another Indie film with a religious theme. But I still liked the story, and was interested in what happened to the characters. It was not without subtle spiritual moments, such as when Eduardo's character tells Tammy's character not to judge his nasty brother too harshly - he had helped him when he was down. (Eduardo relies on that goodness when he leaves work that day.) The film was ostensibly about the value of one human life - Tammy's child. But it was also about the strength of Eduardo's family and their love for each other. Eduardo was able to save Tammy's child because he had his family to back him up as they had when he was the one in pain."
2,Scarred for life,"Hello yeah don't want to rain on everyone's parade but the tragic scene where the little girl is run over and her mother discovers her lifeless body will give me nightmares for the rest of my life. I suppose it's the sign of a good film if a movie can move someone that deeply. Personally I would have prefered to not have watched that horror. Also, well I thought it was somewhat lame that the woman facing the unexpected pregnancy didn't raise her own daughter. And I just wanted to smack her when she kept on crying at the end of the film when she was meeting her daughter for the first time. If she cared that much why didn't she raise her? Anyway I'm glad others love this movie and that it has provoked conversation, but I personally will regret the day I viewed it for the rest of my life LOL. God bless!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This film is poorly made: cliche symbolism, bad acting, and just plain dumb dialogue. But what is worse is that the way the film is packaged is incredibly misleading. Make no mistake--the producers and lead actor have a pro-life mission (this is easily confirmed by interviews and articles available online) and this movie is nothing but propaganda in service of that mission. The film's description tells nothing about this. You're welcome to your own opinion, but don't hide it in the guise of some artsy movie! It's an insult to viewers. I would suggest NOT wasting 2 hours of your life on this mediocre, manipulative garbage."
5,Powerful Movie,"Bella is a powerful, entertaining movie that I reommend for everyone. While it focuses on the importance of family and life, the drama, with some comic relief, is spellbinding.The service from Amazon was excellent."
3,Pretty Good,"After a long time waiting for the DVD, I finally got the chance to sit down and watch this movie. After reading the reviews..seeing the clips, my expectations were pretty high.I was a bit disappointed to tell the truth. I think the movie is good, but, not stupendous. I was hoping for deeper conversations about life etc. The movie was uplifting, but, I don't know, just not as deep as I imagined.Student"
5,Buenísima,"Acabo de verla y todavía me estoy secando las lágrimas: excelentes los protagonistas y los secundarios, entrañable historia y llena de esperanza. Realmente, puede cambiar la vida de quien la vea."
2,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed by Bella. Such big raves from the Bella people. But, not here in our home. Although the film was nice looking -I thought the movie was just a little too 'mysterious' and in some parts I didn't really know what was happening. My children were totally lost and couldn't connect the dots... I did purchase the movie - I just wish I would have rented it first before laying down the cash."
5,Good movie,"A great feel-good movie with excellent acting and a positive, life-affirming message. The ""intense scene"" was very brief, and I wouldn't consider this movie worthy of a PG-13 rating."
5,Bella,"I really enjoyed this DVD and the storyline really did make you think about what is really important in life and that everything comes full circle and no matter what life throws us, as long as we cling to what is right and follow through with it, things do work out for the best way and the best way really does end up being what is best for all of us~"
5,"Outstanding, Bella taps into the Inner Human Beauty!","This is an outstanding movie. Bella touches something deep within your spirit, the very essence/the core of our being. I cannot understand how anyone can watch this movie and not feel the Love, hope, warmth and sincerity that flows from it.Bravo to the writer, director and especially every single actress and actor who performed in it, no matter how big or small their part was. With out a doubt it took every single one of you to make Bella the fabulous movie it is. I will cherish it for the rest of my life and pass it on to my grandchildren. Bella is definitely an inspiring movie that every family should watch together.Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!"
2,OK Product,"this machine is a bit cheap and it didn't come with Microphones until I requested them. then they didn't fit. Get the all in one unit. I wish I had, no hassels."
5,Both advanced and practical,"This book accomplishes what few computer books do. It offers advice that is both advanced and practical. Too often, books offer advice that is either practical but simplistic or advanced but mired in theory. Real Visual Basic strikes a very effective balance.Of particular interest to me are the sections on Visual Basic's object model and the section on coding standards. In all cases, the text is well-supplemented with figures and coding examples. The style is breezy and approachable, and the index is superb.Real Visual Basic has earned a place on my desk-shelf."
2,review of the uprint thermal printer,The Uprint Thermal Printer would be absolutly wonderful if it printed properly in the top area all of the time; about 25% of the time the first letter of the title or the numbers to songs don't print right or at all. The other areas (sides and bottom) seem to be alright.
3,Not as good as 'A Christmas Story',"These ladies have beautiful voices, but I am disappointed by this album. The song selections are trite and the album isn't much of a value at less than 45 minutes long. I prefer the song selection and arrangements of their 1999 Christmas release- it's a unique addition to my Christmas music collection that gets played frequently during the season."
5,Works fine,"I have used this many times. When I received it there was no owners manual, but Nikon was quick to send me one. I have had no problems with it & batteries recharge just fine"
4,Never buy more batteries!,This charger frees one from having to run out and purchase new batteries at the last minute. It's quite convenient to interchange the 2 sets of batteries.
3,911 can do better!,"The only songs I like is perhaps ""Wonderland"". The rest....is just ok. They r nothing I'd find interested in and I regret that I bought the CD very very much. I just hope I haven't buy it!"
4,Books,This is a pretty crazy and complicated play that was ok to read if you don't mind the old language use.
2,Not much to it and not very believable,"Okay, let me see if I have this straight....spoilers below.....Teenage girl hooks up with older guy very quickly. Her parents are okay with it. Her teacher and headmistress object. She thinks she has life all figured out. She travels with this guy and his rude, theft-prone friends and believes she is becoming worldly. She thinks she is above it all and drops out of school. Then she finds out the guy is married and suddenly realizes what a stupid mistake she made. She manages to get into Oxford anyway.I could not get into this. I didn't care about these people and did not find the story very compelling or believable. And if you're going to have Emma Thompson show up in a movie, why not give her more than five minutes of screen time? Stunt casting does not help a weak script."
4,Bad parenting,"I liked this film without doubt, but I confess I was appalled at the bad parenting showed in this movie. How can a parent allow her teenage daughter to date a much older man? Maybe it was normal for the 60's, but in these times, such a thing is considered a no-no. She was besotted, seduced and fooled in the same way I was predicting she was going to be. In the end, I felt sorry for her, but...she learned her lesson.Good performances. Mulligan's facial expressions are lovely and she deserved to be nominated for an Oscar. Loved the clothes, hairstyles, decoration belonging to the era.Even though the end was somewhat predictable, it is a good movie and I recommend it to every teenage girl who thinks she is too smart and deserves something better. Don't try to grow up so quickly. Enjoy your age and be grateful."
2,An Education,"I was not fond of this movie. It is about a girl coming of age and falls in love with an older man. I like both of these actors, but just did not like the story line."
4,"""I feel old. But not very wise.""","The year is 1962, and sixteen-year old Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is a cello-playing student who hopes to attend to Oxford. A chance meeting with a charming man twice her age quickly develops into a romance, opening up an exciting, glamorous world to the young girl.This is a coming-of-age story with a wonderful script and a stellar cast. Young Carey Mulligan is pretty, funny, sensitive, and gutsy and has loads of charisma. She didn't look quite young enough but was still delightful. Peter Sarsaard plays the older man who sweeps her (and her family) of her feet. He's absolutely convincing as the worldly lecher who pursues Jenny. He gave me the creeps and I couldn't understand why her family welcomed him with such open arms. It was nice to see Emma Thompson in a small but meaty role as Jenny's headmistress.Although it has disturbing moments, I enjoyed the movie very much and I think Miss Mulligan is destined for many great film roles in the future."
5,Laugh out loud...,"I am not a big reader, but my wife got me this book for my birthday. I laughed out load almost every page. Wonderful!!"
2,Nice looking but very tight,"They're really very attractive boots however they were so tight I had to return them. The color was exactly what I thought, they looked just like the picture but I could barely get my foot into them and I'm an 8 medium."
3,Not what I was looking for,"The book is okay, just not what I was wanting. I wanted a book of pictures of how they did all the underground stuff in New York City, the progress of constructions and stories of how they did it. The pictures are okay in this book, I was just wanting more."
3,"Arrogant author, mediocre book","""(This book) is meant as an armchair guide to the city's nether worlds, not as an invitation to exploration and that is why no private entry locations will be revealed."" In other words, tough luck to you, would-be adventurous reader.Ms Solis displays a certain Teutonic smugness in her writing, and her own translation of her book from German to English grates on the nerves.I have serious doubts as to whether she actually made at least a couple of the journeys that she claims to her credit, based on my own exploits.Moreover, she praises the work of graffiti ""artists,"" which is inexcusable from a public safety and welfare standpoint.I will give her credit for a couple of interesting photos, both her own and from historical archives, but that's about it."
2,Loud in all the wrong ways,"Don't buy this stereo if you ever plan on listening to music at a moderate to low setting. The DVD/CD motor is so noisy that it rivals the racket your old walkman cassette player made. All joking aside, I am pretty upset that I spent good money on a new stereo that is extremely annoying to listen to. Of course, returning electronic items bought online is like trying to get that tattoo of your ex-girlfriend's name removed. I shouldn't have gone out with JVC in the first place."
5,Durable,"We have been using a rack like this for some time, but found that most, all-wood racks fell apart rather sooner than later. This rack is extremely handsome and durable. What more could we ask?"
4,worth every cent in saved medical bills,This book isn't the easiest to read!!It is best used as the first line of defense when your not feeling well.The book is an excellent source of reading up on the basics of juicing.Don't know what Juicer to buy this book tells you the pluses and minus of all major juicers on the market and no not one juicer will do it all as much as you may have hoped to buy only one product.I personally recommend the book.Bria
5,Not rebadged.....,"Verbatim is owned by MCC (Mitsubishi Chemicals Corp, known to make the best recordable media). The discs are made by MCC. That's not rebadging? I've never heard of anyone buying verbatim discs that did not code out to MCC, so not sure why the comment about consistency either. Verbatim makes the best DVDs you can buy, according to every utility for burn quality out there. My burns in a Ben-Q 1640 burner at 16x (on the 16x version of these discs, but the 8x are just as good at 8x or even 12x speed) come out with a 96% or 97% score in Nero's Disc Scan. As opposed to sub-90% with halfway decent media, or 60% for junky media."
4,Well...,"A few pages were bent severely in the bottom right corner, but other than that I love the book and it was in rather good condition."
1,"Ignorant, Bigoted","Good premise, however, the author displays a total ignorance of the attitudes of Americans. As an American, I am insulted by the stipulation that Americans would have tolerated a government that sanctioned wholesale public atrocities. Is not a bad story, but I cant help but feel disbelief at the assertion that ""the greatest generation"" (ie, my grandparents) could have embarked upon such a horrible affront to humanity."
4,Kotte's non-vocal best from the Capitol label...,"This is a wonderful hour of vintage Leo, on different kinds of guitars, varying styles of song, with and without the company of others. I kind of miss his gravel voice, however, and I think the disc would have been improved with a vocal or two, especially his version of ""Pamela Brown."" However, if you love the guitar, you can't avoid having some Kottke on the shelf, especially these recordings from the 1970's, when his fingers were uninjured and he did a great many uptempo tunes. Also nice is the CD known as ""The Essential Leo Kottke---The Chrysalis Years"" which preserves tracks laid down on his next label after Capitol."
3,usable,i bought mine new but it looks likes someone cut my edges unevenly. Other than that it's very helpful and still usable.
5,Hommage to Liszt,With this cd I was quite overwhelmed. The Idea of another composer with 12 transcendental etudes was not new to me. I had tried to play Dance of the elves (Etude no 11) from this set at the age of 17. The piece in it's self was rather difficult. This is my first time with a Konstantin Scherbakov recordning and I thought It was absolutely masterful playing. Very nationalistic undertones especially with Etudes 3 and 8 (Which is not uncommen with Russian composers) but overall a pleasure to listen to and a great recording to use as a guide when playing these wonderful advanced gems.
3,Dave Riley bogs down in middle age,"Bob Mayer has converted his Dave Riley novels from techno action adventure to plodding political narrative. In this latest novel the real action is limited to the final 20 or 30 pages. A far cry from the almost non-stop action in eyes of the hammer and dragon sym 13.Riley's removal from the military is also less then effective. Why would the actual military personnel involved allow him to do what he does? Another question unanswered is what happened to Sgt. Lorne? He was just dropped in mid story.Mayer, who I have always found to write an enjoyable book, may be just searching for a new direction or a new main character. Hopefully his next work will once again earn a ""ten"""
3,Harmless Spanish pop,"This disc, part of Sony Discos 20th Anniversary series, contains 15 Spanish-language songs by the group Magneto. The disc as a whole is harmless Latin pop. While it's pleasant enough to listen too, I found little on the disc that was particularly memorable.The first song, ""Sugar Sugar"" (a Spanish version of an English pop song, with the title and part of the refrain remaining English) is probably the most fun of all the songs on the disc. Also noteworthy is ""Como pego el son,"" which has a salsa flavor. If you like Latin pop, give this disc a try."
5,Thank you for republishing this book!,"This is one of the three books that have stayed with me since I read them in elementary school. Unfortunately, my mother never hung on to my copy of it (I'm 34 now). The plot has already been summarized by others, but I will say this - it must be a good one if I remember the title and wish I had a copy 25 years later. I had searched for this book in years past and it was out of print. I was delighted to do a search today and found it was republished again! Immediate buy for me. My daughter is only 1, but I will hang onto it until she's old enough to read it for herself. Interested in the titles of the other two books that have bounced around my brain since elementary school? The Hobbit and Charlotte's Web. I'm sure there are many more - these are just the top three."
4,"Informative and fun, but not overly well writen.","An entertaining read for those who want to deconstruct fashion's meanings. It can be recommended as middle brow beach reading.However-- and this may have to be directed to Ms. Macdonell Smith's editor-- this author must never again be allowed anywhere near the first person. Her prose drifts along affably in its descriptions of history and contemporary culture, but collapses in a nerdy, smug heap whenever she uses the ""I"". This mostly-repressed urge to appear precious rears its head a couple of other times throughout the text, for instance when she refers to the Columbine tragedy without ever mentioning ""Columbine"", but all in all, the book's defects are outweighed by its charms."
5,A fitting sequel to the Sorceror's Son.,"This book was, I think, one of the best fantasy books that I have ever read. In the previous book, Cray finds that he has inhereted a powerful legacy not only from his sorceress mother but also from his similarly empowered father. The Crystal Palace shows within its pages how Cray's knowledge - not his enthusiasm - of sorcery increases.To fill this void within himself Cray must look beyond his life and his world. Eisenstein is a mistress of her art and this book serves to exemplify her skill."
4,great series,i've been reading Nora Roberts for years some books i like better than others this premise intrigued me. really enjoyed the series.
5,"Heart warming, exciting and extremely enjoyable!!!","This book, as well as the other McKade brothers book, is super enjoyable reading! The family closeness of the 4 brothers, their women and children in the book is remarkable. Almost a fairy tale if you haven't experienced that kind of closeness in your own family. I would definitely recommend these two novels to any NR lover!!!"
1,The last of any book I would use!,"If you are looking for a book to help your Sailors to get promoted, use the Guide to Naval Writing! This book will not do it, period!"
4,I really enjoyed it.,"when I read the reviews, Some said that they were disgusted and repulsed by the imaged in the book. I thought that it is a great book. I had some laughs while looking through it. It's not a book to leave on your coffee table when all your family is coming for Christmas dinner but we all have the one dad or brother that we can be like ""DUDE, check this out!""90% of images include genitalia (That's a heads-up). I totally recommend this book if you're into creative, nude,erotic or shocking photography. Just get the book... You have nothing to lose (well, $[...] bucks.... You'll spend that at taco bell anyway)"
4,Racy.,"You might be surprised when you start looking through this collection of photographic works. It is a little porno and maybe not to be left on the coffee table for certain guests. There are some interesting works. I would have preferred more non-sexual subject matter, but still appreciate the talent and creativity."
1,An awful book,"The book provides many historical inaccuracies about some religions, and the author seems very unscrupulous about the source of information he uses. I have been a fool to buy the book, and I hope you would not follow my suit."
1,post-modern blather,"I noticed Lincoln's book only because of the similarity of it's title to that of a biography of Andy Wharhol that I read some time ago. Sadly, the book is the perfect example of the contemporary academic practice of working backward from a socio-anthropological conclusion to a tendentious definition that can only lead the innocent reader to buy into the author's political prejudices. Readers wishing an objective analysis of the comparative social functionality of Islam and Christianity should read the Epilog to Anthony Pagden's Peoples and Empires."
5,The best zz top cd since afterburner,"This is an absoultly amazing cd. It's sound is alot like Rythemeen, but the songs are 10 times better. ""Sinpusher"" is ""Pincoushin"" with different words, but you never mind, because it's such a damn good song. Three words can sum up my review, ""Buy this CD!"""
4,A great follow-up to The Top's best CD in 15 years...,"""Rhythmeen"" brought my confidence back in ZZ Top. ""XXX"" proves that it wasn't just luck that these guys dropped the pop and got back to their roots. Best cuts are the ""Fearless Boogie"" (a new ZZ classic), ""Pork Chop Sandwich"", ""36-22-36"", and ""Trippin'"". But wait! The last part of the album is ""live""! Yep, just like ""Fandango"" in '75, they offer up originals in a concert setting for half the album. And, also like ""Fandango"", there's an Elvis cover...this time it's ""Teddy Bear"", done as a slow blues that'll probably cause a lot of procreation through the coming winter season! All-in-all, a noble effort...not as good as ""Rhythmeen"", but still far better than their '80s stuff. For all the fans that packed up and left during that decade, The Top is back!"
1,BAD,"I AM A HUGE ZZ TOP FAN AND HAVE SEEN THEM IN CONCERT AND THEY WERE GREAT.I HAVE LOVED MOST OF THERE CD`S ALWAYS BUYING THEM WHEN THEY FIRST COME OUT.THIS CD SHOULD HAVE A WARNING LABEL ON IT SAYING BUY THIS ONLY IF YOU WANT TO GET BURNED.FRANKLY,THIS IS TRASH.IF YOU ARE NEW TO ZZ TOP,PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS JOKE.TRY TRES HOMBRES OR FANDANGO.THIS CD DOES HAVE TWO GOOD SONGS ON IT,LIVESONGS HEY MR MILLIOMAIRE AND BELT BUCKLE.I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE I`M BEATING UP ON ZZ TOP,BUT IT`S ONLY CAUSE THEY CAN DO ALOT BETTER.HOPE THERE NEXT CD IS BETTER THAN THIS LEMON."
3,It's time for a live album/cd,"As a loyal fan of the 'boys' for close to their entire thirty year career...yes, my first concert was in 1972, I was a bit disappointed. I guess I am from the old school....less electronics and more guitar. I have to admit, though, that the ""Eliminator"" crowd reviews are interesting. I have to wonder if those folks have ever been to a show. The highlight of every ZZTop performance, in my opinion, is when Billy decides to bring out the ""old guitar"" and play ""Just Got Paid."" As he put it during the latest tour with Skynryd, ""It's time to get serious."" It IS time to get serious boys.....put out a 'live album' and let the world know what I've known for years....The albums/cd's are good, but the live Texas band is outfrigginstanding!"
1,XXX is a repugnant stench pile,"What the hell happened to these guys? I swear that this is by far the most evident collection songs that proves that ZZ Top has taken the beer guzzling sex crazed biker genre as far as it can posssibly go.While listening to it, I could not pick up any rythym or coherent feeling of continuity. Its almost as if ZZ Top is proclaiming themselves fresh out of ideas with this new album.Its not even worthy of 1 star, but alas it gets one for the mere fact that they lasted 30 years writing about getting laid and identifying with the biker attitude."
1,Zeesh...what a stinker,"I have been a ZZ Top fan for over a decade, and I can't say that there has been an album that I really disliked...until now. The guitars are not trademark-fuzzy anymore...they're muddy and garbled. None of the songs really stick out, none of them are memorable, and a few of them are downright awful. The last few tracks are live pieces which will annoy you to no end...there's too much ""fan screaming"" in the mix, so much so that you can barely hear the guitars and vocals. If you are expecting something really catchy like Afterburner, or downright fuzzy like Rythmeen, look elsewhere."
1,A simple-minded effort,"There's nothing new here. Old facts, little analysis, a boring narrative. More of a fan magazine profile than an in-depth biography. Very poorly done."
2,Not the best reference you can buy,"Good presentation, interesting ideas, but some of these `things' are downright ridiculous - probably put there to complete the count for the title. For example, 'forgetting your glasses' and `too tight shoes' are aptly put under a special section for `Other Stupid Stuff' and the book would probably have been better off without that section altogether.Having said that, however, some of the problems and the solutions are quite valid and useful especially for the beginning trainer. The book would have a lot better if the problems were chosen based on quality rather than quantity and the solutions explored in greater depth.The Book deals with 7 categories of problems:1) Places you go.2) How you Look and Act.3) Things you Say or Hear.4) Methods & Materials you Use.5) Media and Equipment you depend on.6) Its about Time7) Other Stupid Stuff."
1,Battery didn't even charge.,"I followed the instructions and inserted the battery in to charge. At first the feedback message was ""Battery charging"". After a few hours the message became ""Battery cannot be charged, please replace.""Frustrating. Glad I kept the packaging so I could return it. :("
3,Not genuine,"This IS NOT a genuine Lenovo Battery, which is what I thought I was buying. Day 2 of using it still holding a charge, but tomorrow I am leaving for a trip abroad where electricity supply is sketchy - will this battery last? Don't know because its a knockoff. Fits in the slot well though...Few days later, editing this review. 7/29 My computer is running very hot, and shuts down without warning even though the indicator says there's 30 minutes left (after a full charge at 5 hours, not 7)NOT too happy with this battery right now."
4,"mgr212,tbrown say's","i travel often, and when i'm on the road i look for books that can get me through the trip.not to long or to short.m.j. goes to washington was just the book for me. i planned on reading it coming and going home, but when i got to my destination i kept on reading into the night.anyone who grew up in the 60's will remember a master jones type from their school. it was a different look at what goes on inside the beltway and one of those books that you can't put down.easy reading, good story line, with a good mix of history. master jones rocks!"
4,Jean Stone is back to her old self!,"After Ms. Stone's disappointing previous book, PLACES BY THE SEA, I was so happy that she is back to her old style again! As in her previous works, Ms. Stone uses the friendship between 3 women as the basis of this book, starting when the girls were 10 years old, up to the present time. I love Ms. Stone's manner of dialogue. This book is very easy to read and keeps your interest."
5,Excellent Product,These DVD's were delivered as advertised. They were compatible with my Emerson DVD recorder that uses the 8x speed.
1,NOT dependable,I got this 50 pack because it was cheap... but you get what you pay for...out of the first 6 discs... 3 of them were bad and wouldn't allow me to write to them.... so I am throwing out the rest of the 50-pack because I can't depend on them.They are also quite cheap and flimsy... who knows how long the ones I burned will last...so I am re-burning them on safer more dependable discs.
1,too much of a lecture,"you get what you pay for. if you want a short general tour of buildings and a verry brief overview of art found in the city, and a quick lecture on what is the cause of the demise of the city, then go ahaed. otherwise, get a good book"
5,Southern Secession,"Like most of the world, I grew up thinking Lincoln was one of our greatest presidents. In one respect, perhaps he was. He maintained the ""Union"" but at thecost of disregarding the Constitution and being ultimately responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.This book will open your eyes and make you ask questions. Certainly there is a bias involved. There is also documentation involved. All I got in the history classes so long ago was a bunch of impressive quotes and the evils of slavery. There is a lot more.Prepare to have your predispositions challenged. History is written by the victors. Sometimes their causes are misrepresented and their methods are brutal."
2,This is not history,"Charles Adams is a man possessed: possessed of hatred for Abraham Lincoln, the North, and the United States of the 21st century. That the book is not history is proven by its subtitle: Arguing the Case for Southern Secession. An historian would not argue a case for or against any historical event. Like his counterpart Thomas DiLorenzo, Adams is an unhappy man who feels driven to trash the entire American historical scene with incomplete, anachronistic arguments. Neither man delves deeply enough into history, although Adams is the better of the two in that regard. Suffice it to say that if you truly want history, Adams and DiLorenzo are not the men to deliver it."
3,Author reveals that he is a liberal,I read just enough of this book to find out that the author is a liberal who has little admiration for people of Anglo Saxon ancestry. He says that Anglo Saxons have little to feel superior about because they had little to do with the creation of written languages or other building blocks of civilization. He attributes those accomplishments to Greeks and Romans. What the author misses is that the people in Greece and Rome who advanced civilization came from northern Europe--the Anglo Saxons!Paul R.
4,The rest of the story....,"This book is sure to leave anyone who is curious about the origins of the Civil War with more questions than what one began with. I find provoking more thought and investigation is what makes a book such an interesting read. Although Mr. Adams could do without some hyperbolic inferences he does make some good points in identifying the causes of secession. To be sure it was Lincoln who moved the country to war, as Mr. Adams makes clear. The chapter on the KKK is particularly interesting. I suppose it's true. To the victor goes the spoils...and the priviledge of writing history as they see it."
4,Class Text Purchase,"Purchased book as a required read for a college course. Easy to read and includes many side boxes as examples to the concepts being discussed. Gave four stars because sometimes it went on and on about one concept and skimmed through others that seemed more important to my professor. Overall, good textbook."
5,Depending on your point of view,"This book is certainly not a list of equations explaining how to and when to use them. It includes a lot of theory and derivation which can seem useless when all you want to do is solve V=IR. But I think one of the objectives of this book is to include the complexity behind the equations simply because there is complicated theory behind linear circuit analysis. That is why at times Decarlo will say, 'I will not go into the derivation, that is for more advanced topics' and of that sort. If you want to learn the subject to the fullest understanding, this book will do a pretty good job. That is why it has been published by Oxford publisher like it has. It didn't make it that far for no reason. I have almost finished summarizing the book on my website which can easily be found by typing in the text name and the author followed by notes in a serach engine. In the end though the most important tool that will help you learn the material is practice of course."
3,"I heard great things about these discs, but...","I was hoping for something along the lines of Franck, but was let down. I have listened to this CD several times, hoping that something would catch my fancy, but nothing ever made me say, ""This guy's good!"". The music is generally subdued (I know that I am not being very technical, but I listen to music more for how it comes across and if I could remember a theme that enables me to ""latch on""). I haven't sold this CD yet, but I am close. Perhaps, someone who likes musical theory might appreciate it more. Give me the other French composers any day!"
5,"Extremely informative, well written.","Fantastic book that is extremely in-depth and informative. Anything you ever wanted or needed to know about anabolics is in this book. What is even more important is that it reports the safe approach to anabolics and how, with education, one can successfully use these hormones without the host of side effects the media has brainwashed the general public into believing are ever-so prevalent.Anthony Roberts sure did his research and produced the greatest book on anabolics I have ever read. I can only hope that the juvenile reviews written by those who have never read the book, but rather responded to the topic and not the information contained within the book, are ignored. As these reviews only further the myths and misunderstandings of anabolic steroids with no logical backing or proof to the claims.Great book."
2,This Book Should Not Exist,"We used this book in my undergrad quantum class, and not a single student ever had anything good to say about this book. The entire semester was a complete haze. Griffiths writes a beatiful intro QM text."
2,Not for the Undergrad!,Bought this book to assist me in the introductory level of Q.M. What a waste! Couldn't understand much of it and I already have a BS degree with over 2years of college math. This is defintely an intermediate to upper level Q.M book even though its said to be an undergrad. I wish that some of the people that give these reviews would mention the level their basing their opinion on. The reviews when I bought this book were very good but it must have been from graduates or such.
5,Works well,"My cat likes to stick his head out when he does the deed, it's pretty charming. This works well for us. Our cat likes to kick around his litter a lot and this prevents the litter from getting everywhere. He still tracks it out cause he does a championship run after going poop. I put a little $1 carpet mat to catch some of the litter right in front. He's even hung out in there once or twice. This also helps to mask the scent. Since I only have one cat, I don't have to change the litter box for over a week usually. I got big pan liners to use with this. I think we'll have this for a long time."
4,good for their intended use,"While the one star review is true, I believe the reviewer was a bit too harsh. I like these speakers for their portable audio uses as intended. Perhaps at $30 he felt he paid too much and might be right. You can find these speakers cheaper, (i've seen them as low as $15). I paid $30 a long time ago and have used them a lot. I can use them with my solar powered rechargeable AA's on river trips, (but I actually use them only in my backyard as yet ;-)The sound is perfectly adequate for the speakers that they are. If the lone star reviewer expected better audio quality, he should certainly have thought ahead to buy more expensive computer speakers as suggested but they won't come battery powered like these!I simply love having fully portable speakers for my CD and radio devices as well as for my laptop. I like them for what they were intended and I will happily bump up the star value on this product.Enjoy!"
1,SONY SUCKS,"this model is the same as the mdr-v250 despite the new color silver....i have had 2 pairs of them which both broke. they have terrible sound. i dont reccomend them. dont over estimate sony's reputation...you want some good headphones, never buy sonys, they suck"
3,Good sound for small heads,"These headphones produce reasonably good sound, but they are a little tight on my big (adult) head. They are perfect for my kids, however. The cord is really long, so use with an iPod is a bit awkward."
3,Good value but fit tight,"Pros: Good sound for the price, and nice long cord, and they look nice.Cons: They fit too tight, and I couldn't adjust it."
5,The Dj Image Headphones,"Good Headphones and they have the image, almost all professional djs own a pair of these"
5,Love it!,I bought this headphone five years ago here at Amazon.com. It is still alive and working. I LOVE THIS HEADPHONES!! They do last long!
2,Not Durable Enough for club DJ use.,"I just broke my second pair of these headphones. I will NEVER buy another pair of Sony V700s again. I also wear glasses and can only comfortably use them for 5-10 minutes. I chose these because they are one of the loudest DJ heaphones on the market. Neither set lasted longer than a year and a half. I would recomend Sennheiser 280, Technics 1200, or the Pioneers over these. If you must go with Sonys go with the 7506s. Not as loud but much more durable as well as comfortable."
2,"Sound Good, But Break after 13 months","These headphones are good for dj'ing, look nice etc, but they will break after just over one year. This is probably built into the design. The swivel joint cracks, the earpiece surround disintegrates, and, as far as I am aware individual parts cannot be replaced. This happened to me after just over one year of light use"
4,Instrumental Prog Rock,"This is a new (relatively) progressive rock / fusion 4-piece from France. Songs are all-instrumental, and range in length from 3 to 10 minutes long. Points of comparison include Djam Karet and Priam. Good stuff-- very good-- actually, if you like this kind of prog."
3,"good film, not too good quality","i've always been a cleese fan. connie booth is great too. so, i figured this would be a great film. well, it was just good. it was very silly arbitrary humor, but it still got a few laughs. so film overall-4 1/2 stars. i gave it 3 star for quality. i dont know about you guys, but when you got the dvd, were there white lines running through it like a vhs would? maybe it was just me or it was the poor video transfer. the voices were muffled and the picture was grainy, but i guess thats the best you could get for a movie over 40 years old. so overall, if you could get a deal on this film, go for it. its pretty funny if you like the python scenario scetches, but if thats not what you're looking for, check out fawlty towers with john cleese and connie booth. its fantastic!"
4,Great DVD.,"I'm not going to lie: I had NO expectations for this DVD (it's produced by the WWE, after all). Luckily CM Punk had a lot to do with this project and it shows. It's very well made, very honest and very interesting. Although it's a shame we can't see any of Punk's matches outside of the WWE, there's still a lot to love here."
2,Don't buy this book,"Don't buy this book if you're looking for insight into paring down your own complicated life, learning to make do with less, or steering yourself toward a less materialstic lifestyle. Carlomagno clearly knows nothing about any of that. Her idea of ""giving up"" dining out for a month? Rescheduling all her dinner dates for the following month. I was so unimpressed I couldn't finish it. And I'm an avid ""finish-the-book-no-matter-what"" reader. Nope. Couldn't do it. Don't buy it, don't read it. Waste of time."
1,Just Plain Silly.,I was pretty disappointed in this book. I was all settled in for a great story of learning to live with less... And instead found myself reading about self-discovery through eschewing the elevator. Really?!The topics were covered with such a superficial treatment that they felt like magazine fluff pieces: All style and no substance. I quit halfway through the book after leafing ahead and seeing no redemption in the near future.And anyone who has THAT much trouble giving up drinking for a month might seriously want to consider a treatment program.
4,LOVE THIS EARPHONES!!!,"I look at Bose, look at sony, look at most of the item but non of them give a good review. So i decide to buy this earphone and my friend bought another one. All i can say here is, with the price of this item, i say this is item is better than my friend. Almost same quality but he paid MORE. I like the SnugFit, 1st time the headset actually fit my ear and really just sit there no matter what i do. I like the cable as well. (Just don't make it wet.) After 3 weeks of nonstop usage (gym, office, jog) and i dont feel any disappointment."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"This book is horrible...explanations are very unclear, or better said, non-existent at all.A clear exposition is not given at all."
5,Inside of the life of Paul Lynde....,Interesting detailed life story... Too bad they omitted some of thedirty laundry... I could tell you stories Sista! Its a fun read andgreat for a few laughs...
4,Center Square the Paul Lynde Story,Thought it was a great book and well written. Always was curious about his life being a gay man myself. He was one of the pioneers that wasn't afraid to be who he was!
1,Worse than no holster,"Cell Phone Holster Swivel Belt Clip for Motorola W315This product was a big disappointment for us. Well, a small one because at the price we paid we had no big expectations. It's a flop. The phone way too easily pops out at most inopportune moments. Well, not the very most inopportune ones, it didn't jump out on the bridge nor over a toilet but we'd be walking and realize the phone ""went missing"". We'd find the phone in the car or truck, down between the seats.This happened several times before we decided to park the ""holster"" and carry the phone more securely. We use a couple different cases to carry our very compact Canon Powershot camera and have never had the camera escape. We expect the same from whatever would carry our cellphone.I'd not buy this holster again and cannot recommend it."
4,good general spray,"This is a good general spray for the home orchard. The gallon size is great, last me a couple of seasons."
2,"Decent Sound, Cheap Plastic","Between my bandmate and I we have owned 3 pairs of these headphones over the last 4 years, and each one has had the exact same problem...that being the plastic breaking on one of the ear pieces and rendering them unwearable (unless you want to break out a lot of scotch tape). Other than that fundamental problem these headphones are decent, with good (although a bit overly bassy) sound for the price...but the cheap/shoddy production is enough to render any good qualities they have moot. I won't be going back for my 4th pair."
3,"Good comfort, sound -- falls apart later","I've had these headphones for a couple of years now. They sound great and are VERY comfortable, with a silky-smooth earcup lining that means you can wear them for hours.UNFORTUNATELY, that same, comfortable lining soon began to crack, and is now flaking off in pieces about the size of a dime. The headphones still sound good, are still comfortable, but quite a bit of thin, black plastic came off before I noticed the problem. Walking around with stuff like that stuck to the side of your head is not a fashion statement.Is is not sun-induced, as I use them only indoors. I think it may be some kind of fatigue from putting them on and taking them off. So far, it's only happened to the right earcup. The left remains intact.Maybe I just have very caustic skin oils, on one side of my head? I think not.I really liked these headphones soon after I bought them, but now that this has happened I just can't recommend them."
1,plug went bad,"From the start had to fiddle with plug to get good sound.At first, I thought it was the computer jack, but as timewent on it got worse and worse. Did some experimentingand determined it was definitely loose wiring in the plug.You spend this kind of money you at least expect it to bemanufactured well. I'm done with Sony. I've had other badexperiences recently, they just aren't what they used to be."
5,MDR-V600,"My 3rd of Sony headphones replaces my older sets V-6 (nicked the cord/ear pads worn) and the much older V-150's (lighter weight) in some 25+ yrs using them @ the office. Frequency response is as expected (5-30,000 Hz). Comfort exceptional-I can wear them all day. Definitely more expensive brands out, I'll stick with these.Super Saver a ++."
5,Sony MDR-V6000,"We tried several different brands of headphones, and we are stuck on Sony. The frequency range is so nice, especially with regard to the response on the low end. They are comfortable, and they seem to be well-constructed. We're happy campers!"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought them and am disappointed. Not sharp enough, too bulky for being portable, not nearly as good as my original sony headphones bought 10 years ago. Try Grado."
2,"Good sound, but black vinyl coating deteriorates.","I have had two pairs (second one was inherited literally) and both times after a few months the thin black coating peels off. For a product this expensive, that's not cool. The first pair I got over ten years ago and for less money. I don't know why this cost so much, there are better quality products out there. Would not recommend."
5,Well worth the price,"I've always gone the cheap route, and purchased $30 headsets that would last for a couple years and develop crackly sounds along the way. Tiring of that in my middle age, I decided to spring for something a bit better, but first checked with Amazon's reviews. This led me to the MDR-V600 headset, which was about $80. Should have done it a long time ago... Money well spent! Excellent volume range, comfortable, covers my ears so well that it excludes all outside noise even at moderate output. I used them mostly for listening to itunes on my computer while I do other things. Occasionally to practice piano/keyboard. Like I said, money well spent, although I have only had them a couple months. Other reviewers give high marks for longevity, so I expect they will be satisfying for me as well."
5,Great!!!!,"This headphone is really great, with a very wide range of frequencies an very comfortable!"
4,Solid sound and isolation,"These headphones I have owned for 2 years and are still working great. I use them to play my electric drums set ( Roland TD-3 ) and they sound pretty awesome. I like the fact that you can use two types of jacks so I can listen to my zune and play my drums or guitar and use them to record music. I bought these for my dad to listen to his ipod and he loves them.I paid $100 from a retailer so the amazon price is great. They also work better than noise isolation headphones because they go over your ears. The only complaint is they get a little warm after a couple of hours, but that only happens when I play my drums so that might be why. Overall very solid headphones for the price."
3,For Advanced Speakers,"I can't blame the book- I'm sure the stories are great but this book is really geared towards those interested in advanced literature. I've done other side by side books before which have been incredibly helpful, but I really couldn't glean any conversational spanish from this book at all as the English is very formal. but, if you are an advanced speaker WITH an interest in literature, then I'm sure this would be fantastic."
3,Advanced Short Stories,"Just like in English, languages evolve over centuries. These are 14th and 15th century writers, classic writers of Spanish stories. Readers of this book should expect that the language in this book is not contemporary: unfamiliar words and expressions are used in each short story. Fortunately, at the back of the book many of the unfamiliar words are defined. And endnotes enhance points that aren't clear. If you're an intermediate Spanish reader, I definitely recommend getting another book. The challenges within this collection of short stories can be a bit much at times."
1,"Burn, ""Burn, Christmas! Burn!!"" Burn!!","While I sympathize with the anti-consumerism ideals behind it, this book is just poorly done. The rhyming scheme is stilted and forced, it's overly wordy, and the narrative is disjointed. It's bad, folks. This book is bad. As Dorothy Parker said, ""This book should not be set aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."" Do yourself and those Chinese printers a favor: suppress your consumerist tendencies! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! May it go out of print immediately. Amen."
1,Not a fan,"I really did not like this workout video. Ms. O'Brien is neither motivating nor inspiring, merely condescending and annoying. The ""artsy"" black and white shots are useless and distracting. I do not understand all the good reviews. This is without a doubt the worst fitness video I've ever seen."
1,"Wanting the fairytale, but not getting it.","This author may have fairytale endings to many of her books, but fairytale is far from what this author lives. In a description of what this author likes to do with her spare time, she states that she likes to spend time with her two sons. She also has two stepsons who she will not even consider her stepsons, and this is quite evident to both of them in their young lives. She writes of the finer things in life, but money and material things will not make you happy in real life, Ms. McKinney."
2,Disappointed,This is the first novel I have read by Mrs. McKinney. It is unfortunate that the jacketcover intro did a great job of wetting the appetite only to have the storyline fall short. The premise and characters had great potential yet fell flat after their inital meeting. Characters carefully designed to perfection somehow dissipate leaving one to wonder if they deserve one another or if it was even worth the hassle. Again great plot and characters quickly becoming....boring....
1,Poor performance and no support from the manufacturer,"I bought about ten sets of these batteries, I figured NiMH cells were all pretty much the same. I was wrong. After two break-in cycles on my Maha C-9000 charger then a refresh and analyze cycle it reports average capacity as approx 1200mah. The actual capacity ranges between 700mah and 1500mah.They also initially had problems charging in the charger, it said they were full but i'd only get 5 full power flashes from a Canon 580EX before they wouldn't charge the flash any more. Only the breakin cycles made them work at all. Once I had them charged they really just didn't work well, being very low capacity and just generally not working.I emailed the manufacturer's support email address and didn't receive a response.I wouldn't recommend purchasing these batteries."
1,no good,I had a set of these batteries that served me well for years. But the replacements would not charge properly even in the CTA charger and did not hold a charge. I had to recycle them and get a different brand.
4,3 years and no trouble - good batteries,"I bought these with the CTA charger in 2006 - it's now late 2009, and I've had no trouble with them.I suppose I have only recharged them ten times or so, but they seem to last very long and I onlyrated them 4 out of 5 because I haven't used them vigorously and I have no way to measure currentor other technical aspects. I just checked them and they were charged 2 months ago and my flashunit works just fine with no delay - just as if the batteries were totally fresh.I'd buy them again - in fact I am buying a backup set."
2,"Difficult to use, disorganized","I used this book for an MBA finance class but I am not keeping it as a reference. I felt it was convoluted and badly organized. It was difficult to look up subjects using the index when you wanted to just crack the book and find a formula or look for something specific. Since that's what I would do if I kept the book as a reference, the value for me is not there. I'm looking for a different book that is better organized and easier to understand for my reference book."
2,Buyer Beware,"The charger I received is not the charger pictured here. The cradle was odd shaped so the Q does not fit comfortably into it. I beleive the charger I received was for a different phone, although it will charge the Q. They should indicate the the charger they will send you may not match the photo. This is why the description is arbitrary."
2,"A Stand, Not a Charger","I've posted pictures of the stand I actually received and it doesn't look anything like the one pictured. What you actually get is another mini-usb to usb cable and a weighted plastic stand. It's not powered, so any charging is done via USB, which is an iffy proposition at best.It will charge the Q (sort of) and does keep the phone upright, so it's easy to see and out of the way, which is why I gave it two stars instead on one. But if I'd had a chance to look at what was really going to be delivered, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,"Interesting insight at times, but too apologetic to Stalin","An interesting book, but it seems as if the author is constantly defending the soviets. While discussions are made on the incredible toll the russian people took the author seems to try to convince the reader that soviet cunning won the war. Most books I've read indicate the overwhelming numbers and sheer human flood tide was the deciding factor. The author does make some good arguments and provides some new insight, but in the end contradicts himself. While stating the russians did not win because of huge material and personnel imbalances he later adds the soviets enjoyed from a two-to-one to ten-to-one advantage. At times the book crawls and I actually put it down and read a different book. All in all not a bad book, but not one of my favorites."
4,Very Good,"I found this book to be very concise, yet also provide a wealth of information. If you are new to the East Front, i defenitly reccomend ""Russia's War"""
2,Birnbaum is not ideal.,"Working for Disney, I can tell you first hand that this guide to WDW was out of date the second it was published. WDW changes so frequently that prices and attractions listed in Birnbaum are already out of date. Also, a very scary fact about reading this ""guide"" is that a lot of the people who are at WDW read the same book you read, so those insider facts are no longer insider facts. For example, everyone goes to WDW when Birnbaum says the lines are shortest, hence the lines are not short. I believe this is one of the reasons Birnbaum is out of date when it hits the stands. The book does offer good descriptions of the parks and resorts with great pictures, but I wouldn't suggest hanging on to every word like it is scripture."
3,Good but .......,"This book was very good as far as telling you when to hit what attractions. The problem that I had with it was it praised every ride and attraction as though they were all great. Things like the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and The Enchanted Tiki Hut should be skipped, and should be noted in any Disney guide book."
4,Best headphones i ever had with drawbacks in the design,"I've been using theSony MDR-V500DJ Monitor Series Headphones with Swivel Earcupsfor about 4 weeks now and I have to admit they are the best I've ever had. The sound quality is fantastic and I love to listen to my music using them. Even in an noisy environment they manage to work properly.The only drawback with those headphones is the design, they creak alot when you readjust them on your ears or even touch them while wearing.Else than that they are great."
2,Not the Best Sword I Have,When I first got the Sword it looked very good.Then I looked at the blade I was dissapointed.It had lots and lots of Scratches on it.If it did not have those scratches it would be Great.It's very beutiful and does not shake when you swing it.If you want to risk it and see if you can get it without Scratches it's a beautiful sword.
3,Fast paced,"This is a very fast paced novel. I have only finished the first book in the trilogy but have found this to be an enjoyable fast read. I look forward to the next two books. The world Nix creates is different from any other. If you like fantasy or video games even, I believe you will like this series. I felt a bit like I was playing a video game with all the magic gadgets, spells, characters and secret places."
1,Weak!,"This is not the Abrasive Wheels record to get! There's nothing abrasive about it! The guitar is like a chiming bell, and Shonna sings with an insipid, whiny voice. The songs are very chorus driven and extremely repetitive, and are dragged out way too long. Some of this stuff could be tolerable if the band could just wrap it up. Very weak sounding to this day, and an extreme letdown. Don't let the name Abrasive Wheels fool you, as these punks already marched in, and once they'd made it, they took themselves seriously, and softened up the hard edges to made this turd that sits on my desk. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
1,oral indecency,"I am insanely addicted to energy drinks. I've probably tried at least 30 different kinds. I was so excited to try this one b/c the flavor sounded good and it certainly seemed like it would pack in a good energy punch. I'll never know if it does raise energy levels since I was unable to manage more than a sip of it. It tastes like some salt crystals mixed with weird synthetic chemicals, with a supersaturated infusion of grossness."
3,Good pix...Bad cartridge!,"The Samsung SPP-2040 printer produces great pix (good color, saturation, clarity, etc.), but one of the 3 ink cartridges (3 cartridges--120 sheets of 4x6 paper) broke (paper got stuck in printer and had to be ""torn"" out to remove)...and therefore was unusable. I now have 2 cartridges and 120 sheets of paper, and not enough ink to use all sheets. Not happy!! I LOVE the quality of the finished print, but think I should (somehow?!) get another ink cartridge from either Samsung, as manufacturer, or Amazon, as sales vender. Good luck, huh!"
4,"Not a big budget movie, but good entertainment.","This is not a glossey high amp western with a great sound track like the Young guns set. It doesn't even cover much of the Lincoln county war. What it does have though is a somber and gritty realism. What it covers of the kids life is historically pretty accurate.I gave this film four stars because of the fine portrayal of the kid by Val Kilmer. He shows him as a some what awkward troubled adolecent with a wry sense of humor. And when he has the famous portrait done,with that toothy grin, he really could pass for William H. Bonney.I recommend this movie for those who don't require constant action and would enjoy a good historic story."
3,Good but not Perfect,"This movie was pretty good, and I speacially like how they had Billy not drink much in the beginning. Sadly, they did the traditional thing and made Billy have very few partners. In the movie, Billy and Tom kill Brady and one deputy, in actuality, Billy, Jose Chavez Y Chavez, and 4 other regulators killed Brady and 3 deputies. I also hate how they skip the entire Lincoln county war.Kilmer did good as Billy, but they made him too cold blooded. I admit, Billy wasn't a romeo or a Robin Hood, but Billy was not cruel! Every man he killed had it coming to them. In the movie they made Billy get mad fast and in the end he drank alot, where as in reality he didn't drink and he wasn't easily angered(or there'd have been alot more people killed by him)."
1,Doesn't fit the Kitchenaid Immersion Blender...,Since it says it's an attachment for the Immersion Blender... one would think that it would fit. False! Make sure it will fit yours before you buy it.
1,These are the days of our lives.,"How many story lines can we fit into one movie, how about at least 5. This way we'll never feel a connection towards any of the characters or their annoyingly cliche story lines. This movie feels more like a soap opera, or it could be a television miniseries with the amount of story they want to fit in one movie. Cliche, cliche, cliche. Haven't we seen all of these stories before in other movies, the same characters, etc. Disney sure knows how to make a pretty lame movie about Prom. Hopefully everyone's prom this year is more exciting than this movie."
5,Great book!,"This book is really great for anywhere up to 6th grade. Another book that I loved as well is ""Did You Ever Wonder..."" by Brendan Lynch. After my boys read Lunch Money they dived right into the Did You Ever Wonder... book. I love it when my boys read instead of video games!"
3,Preview,It was a good book although it was hard to understand in the middle of the book. I liked that a boy should make money but it was not about lunch money it was about kids making money at school
1,Worth a look?,"This has to be one of the worst Solaris study guides I've looked at. Several of my colleagues use it to do a study class, but we have found some of the material to be incorrect and/or badly presented. My advice would be to avoid buying this one!The best way to prep for the exams is to get hold of a set of the authorized training guides from Sun ( someone needs to go to class for that though ) and use those in conjunction with practice tests."
4,Easy reading,"Like others have mentioned, the book is easy to read. It's a chatty style, but not annoyingly so. I think there could've been a little more thought put into some of the lists of options.. eg if an option is -r then describe it as ""remove"" not ""delete"". And no that's not a direct example from the book. There are a lot of typographical errors, which aren't too hard to spot, but you'd think for the price someone at the publisher could have bothered proof-reading it. Ignore the reviews which say the book only covers Part I. The first 16 chapters cover Part I, chapters 17-29 cover Part II. It's not that hard to work out, given that it mentions both exams on the cover of the book."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I have been doing SA work on Suns for over 10 years. When ourproject decided to make the upgrade from Solaris 2.6 to 8.0 Ithought I could upgrade my knowledge and consider getting thecertification, too. However, this book does not seem to get thejob done.I have never seen a technical book so full of errors. Thereare typos; there are errors in the sample output; the technicaldata is wrong.There also seems to be a basic lack of knowledge of UNIX andSolaris. For example, (paraphasing a bit) ""a directory is nota file"", or ""the getty process allows users to access thesystem"". Au contraire - a directory IS a file and getty belongsin SunOS; Solaris uses saf.This book appears to be an attempt to take some boilerplate,throw in some unique content, and get it out to market asquickly as possible. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"Ok book, terrible exam simulator","Since I am studying for 310-012 (part 2) my review really only covers that section.This book seems to have good information. It covers most of the exam objectives quite well and fortifies many of the key concepts with examples.Where it falters, however, is in the exam simulator that is included on the companion CD. It is so full of errors that getting an accurate reading of your readiness is difficult at best. Taking their pratice exam was more frustrating than helpful. There are several questions where an answer is listed as being both correct and incorrect...one question i would take as an editing mistake but several? That is just carelessness.Buy the book if you want to reinforce other reading, from the Solaris Training Manuals for example. But there are far better, and more accurate exam simulators out there for Sys Admin II."
2,Do not rely only on this book.,"If you rely on this book only then you will surely fail the exam.This book does not cover the necessary topics like the KERNEL,BOOT PROM and info about serval configuration files in depth. The cert exam is not a true representation of the real exam.There is only a single exam in the examslim software with questions and these questions are sometimes ambiguous. In short you need to read sundocs and practice on a system."
5,This Thing!,"Man,it's a good mike!Value! Clear and powerful.Obviously great for minidisc recording but it sounds good on a piano going into a Fostex MR-8HD.Yep,it's a keeper."
4,Sony ECMMS907 is a decent mic,"I bought the mic to use with a digital video camera that has an external mic jack. You know how video cams get lousy audio because the mic is over with the camera and not out with the subjects? When this mic is out in front the length at its cord (5 ft), it provides great audio. When I add a 10ft extension, the mic loses quite a bit of its signal so that the audio level I get is about 60% of what it was with the shorter length cord. Still much better than if I use the mic on the camera. So maybe you will not try to use a longer cord - the main issue with the mic is that it would be nice if it produced a higher level of audio output so that you get a stronger signal into your recording device, but the sound it gets is nice and clear and it works well for amateur applications."
5,Somehow has become an essentil disc...,"I first saw this group play live at the 2004 CMJ in NYC. I was hooked. Over the last 5 years I have continually had this disc in the rotation. A great mix of silky, airy vocals, quick beats, and angular guitars and synths. It's a hard one to categorize, but of course they get mentioned along-side the better-known Buffalo Daughter. That fits, but I think L.O. is a bit poppier in their song structure and the guitars are more piercing. This is their best disc in my opinion..."
5,Oklahoma City history,This book should be in your collection if you are an Oklahoma history buff. Just looking at the INDEX list will show you the hundreds of people and places that you will want to see and read about that are in this one book.
3,Great for basic functions and basic equipment,"This is a very user-friendly remote, great for tv, vcr, receiver (it allows me to control the volume with my receiver when controlling any other source....this is great). There's only one thing: I could not use it with my dvd player (and it's a sony)¿?¿?¿......so it's not an universal remote for me....I think its not the perfect choice for home theater fans, there are better ones for about 20 bucks more."
5,Wow!,"As an American remotely aware of the Balkan crisis I found this film to give an extensive overview of the history. However, the film is touching and charged with emotion. I was recommended this film by a friend o serve as a parable to the curren times we are living in. Bravo for ""Welcome to San Pedro"" and director Sasha Knezev."
5,Visual Master Piece,"I loved this book. I already had a good general feeling for HTML, but this book really makes it easy for you to learn it. Lots of graphics, highlights, and great sectioning of this book make it a GREAT buy. When there was something I wanted to look into, it was easy to find and the section went into enough detail for me to know it without reading about the history of the funtion like some other books do.The best thing about this book is that it's CONCISE! Most books go into unnessasary detail or drone on and on just to make the book bigger and thus try to make itself seem like a better value, but this book doesn't. It is well written and gets straight to the point! ... uh. unlike this great review! =)"
2,A little dissapointed,From the very first chapter of this book I felt put off. I had read the first two books about three years ago while I was fourteen and I had really enjoyed them. Recently I decided that I should finish the series and so I began reading 'Who I am'. The character of Cailtin seemed to me to be nothing more than another spoiled little hypocrite almost everything she said in the book was a contradiction of something said earlier. I felt that it tried to manipulate the reader into thinking that ONLY christians are good and saved and that any other religion is wrong it also put me off when it came to the issue of race and sexuality I really dont think the subject matter was handled in a responsible way. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone except a deep christian or someone over the age of 18 after they have decided THEMSELVES what is right and wrong because this book has the power to manipulate and guilt people.
3,Not useful to everyone,"I have to admit, I wish I lived in a world where I could wear those clothes and not have people looking at me like a freak!I like the concept, the basics of this book, but if you live in San Francisco, some of it will not apply, if you live in Atlanta, you'll find some of it useless, so this is not for everyone.I have to say, though, that this would make a good present for those people who show up at church weddings wearing jeans!"
1,If you are over 30 don't waste your money on this book.,"Disorganized, hard-to-follow book featuring clothes that would be inappropriate for most occassions unless you are under 30 or live in NYC - maybe in Los Angeles. I'm sending it back to Amazon."
5,"If you love clothes, you will love this book!!","I love shopping and clothes and this book has been a great help with both. I have been able to reduce my closet of things I haven't worn in years and fill it with great items (suggested by this book). I think its great that it gives you suggestions on how to pull together outfits for different events, seasons and geographic locations. We visited Italy last Spring and it would have been a great resource guide for packing. I found the ""must have"" section to be very accurate and sensible. I love to keep up with what the basics are in dressing and then add to them with some interesting selections and this book has helped with both!!"
5,Chris Bennett finds murder once again,"Our housewife sleuth, former nun Christine Bennett is working with a trio of elderly rent control tenants who are barely hanging onto their homes while being harassed by the owners of their building to drive them out so the apartment house can be gutted and turned into high priced condos for a tidy profit to the landlords.On Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, Mr. Herskovitz is found dead, viciously beaten. Christine isn't convinced that the motive was a scare tactic that got out of hand, as the police believe. She begins to dig into the past and comes up with several other suspects. Will her own life be in danger until this mystery is solved? You bet, but in the mean time, the reader is treated to another cleverly crafted, multi-layered story. Proving that even old men sometimes have secrets that they want to hide. And also proving that it is mighty hard to keep anything hidden from our hero Chris, once she starts hunting for answers."
5,Awesome Sound Reproduction,"I have had a variety of Sony Headphones (and others over the years - Sennheiser, Nady, Panasonic, Pioneer, etc.) including the MDR V-700, V-300, V-7506 and others. These MDR-V900 Monitors though are the best! I use them for monitoring music, movies, and most importantly, I use them when playing my Bass Guitar at church. They have a great ""boot'en"" bottom-end as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction...they simply kick! I paid much more for them than that advertized on Amazon right now and I am considering buying other pairs for my drummer, sound technician, and guitarist for our church group. My opinion is you can't go wrong with these babies!"
3,5 years after Purchase,"These Headphones have lasted 5 years and now the Cord shield is deteriorating. These Sony Headphones do sound really good, but would have to make some adjustments with placing them over my ears to get the great sound.These Sony Monitor Headphones are very good for home use which is what I purchased them for. The music I listen to works well with these nicely; Meditation and Environmental Music files, also Drum Music.Sony has a great line of products, but the Construction of the cords are very poor. If the cord had greater quality, then these headphones would have another star in my rating.As far as my recomendation is for these, Well, I can't make one since they only would last for five yrs. I have used them a lot, but have starting using my Sony earbuds more, and even those seem to have poor cord construction.So because of the Very Poor Cord Construction, I would now suggest another brand for Headphones, or Earbuds."
3,Comfort is worth a lot,"I originally bought the Technics RP-DH1200 headphones which I think are about the best sounding headphones out there. However, after wearing them for about an hour, my ears were hating me and all I stood for...but mostly the headphones. A DJ friend of mine suggested the MDR-V900s and I was able to buy them from a vendor in China for $60. They are quite a bit more comfortable but definitely don't sound as good. They are definitely worth the $60 but not more than that by any means. There must be a pair of headphones out there that sound like the Technics but feel like these, though I have not found them."
2,just ok,"when Ruben is trying to channel Luther Vandross he is doing alright,but when he is trying to play a Role that ain't really him then his stuff comes off mad corny. that is why he is a Artist who is still trying to find a Idenity. none of these songs stand out. His vocals are good,but he isn't getting the right kind of material to balance his talent out the right way. somewhere between the slow jams&Gospel is where his best stuff is,but what Writer&producer is gonna get Ruben there? also will he ever get there or just be stuck with Average records?"
3,yuck,if you are a fan of jeri ryan's youll love this calendar (there's a poster of her in it) but if you are not a fan-- you'll find it as yucky as i did- a waste of money.
2,"Nice, but not as nice as the price would lead you to hope","I've had this blade on a DeWalt chop for about three or four months of medium use, mostly cutting softwoods and Trex (Which admittedly might be worse for it than wood). The lst few weeks, I've been cutting a bunch of mahogany for a kitchen, and the cut quality just hasn't been nearly what you would expect for over a hundred dollars. On the other hand, the teeth on this blade are ENORMOUS, it clearly can be sharpened repeatedly. Still,for this price, I'd like to be able to go a little longer without sharpening."
2,not as described,"It is not waterproof, it is smudgeproof, which means it does smudge, I have waterproof and did not have the problem. Does not have the staying power of waterproof."
2,Forget about this remote!,"Nice looking remote, with glow-in-the-dark buttons and rubber edges and feet so it won't scratch the furniture. But it won't control ANY DVD players and it won't control the PIP feature of our new Sony 32"" TV, model KV-32FV15. I tried out several options to make these features work using this remote, then called the Sony help representative, who confirmed that this remote will not control DVD players and will only control basic features on many components."
3,"fine, but not awesome","I've had these headphones for about three years and used them almost exclusively on my PC for listening to music while I work. They still look like (relatively) new, and deliver adequate sound for my purposes. The inline volume control is marginally useful, but as noted by another reviewer, it went ""bad"" long ago and now requires fussing to get it to connect. Sometimes one or both channels is just ""missing"" and you have to roll the volume control up and down to get it to engage.Pros:- reasonable price- pretty good sound quality- not giant on your headCons:- the in-line volume control will go bad on you, requiring wiggling to get it to work- ear cups are small... too small? they mash on my ears"
3,"Good sound, disappointingly fragile","For four years I was a paper carrier. I delivered my newspapers in the morning, between 4:00 and 5:30 AM, back when I was in high school. I always had a portable CD player with me, and used these headphones to listen to music while I delivered. In those four years, I had gone through FOUR pairs of these. I loved their sound, and they were fairly comfortable, but after an hour and a half of wearing them, they did hurt my ears. I still use a pair (the last pair I bought). Be warned, both the 1/8 inch connector and the volume control are easily damaged, making either the left or right earphone, or sometimes both, stop working. I tried to repair them, but found very cheap wiring when I went to splice a new connector onto them, which may explain why they failed so easily. This last pair has held up fairly well, but even now, the connector is failing. Be warned, they're fragile and can be uncomfortable."
2,Cheap cans with not much to impress,These can be considered entry-level headphones with bass emphasis. OK for listening to techno and heavy rock but nothing impressive. Absolute disaster with classical or any music where you'd like to hear the individual instruments and clarity. I would not buy a second pair if mine broke.
3,Hurts my ears,"I bought the Sony Studio-Style MDR-V150 from wal-mart for 20 bucks. They start hurting my ears every time I listen for more than 10 or 15 minutes. I thought they'd loosen up after I'd broken them in but I've had them for two weeks and used them every day. They're just as painful.The review below is right about being suited only for rock or rap. It's also good if you're listening to tinny sounding WMAs or MP3s. Seems like a great deal for 20 dollars, but then you realize you really do get what you pay for. I saved my receipt I plan to take them back."
5,Fantastic reference!,This book is PACKED to the bring with great data and excellent diagrams. I am a writer who has the USS Iowa as focal set piece in my story and this book has allowed me to portray the grand ship correctly! Worth every penny!
3,ok but could be better,"This is the third book by S. Holzner of the Black Book seriesthat I bought.To the others I gave the highest rating, but this book is justso-so.It does have lots of short input-processing-output samples that I liked best in the previous books; that is, complelte self-contained programs.Unfortunately, especially as the book goes along, it deteriorates into what looks lik just wholesale copying from theonline documentation, with no explanations and no clarifications. Where his sources are obscure, they remain so. Also, lots of the sample programs (especially later in the book)illustrate just one or two features of the class where it would not have taken much more space to illustrate ten or twelve features (e.g., of the classes that read and write files).It's sad that I can no longer count on S. Holzner to produce books that I can count on being good just because they bear his name and are of the Black Book series."
2,Help,"i NEEED the email of(stlreader from St. Louis, MO USA )Please stlreader put your email ...thanks"
2,I bought these for running but they didnt stay in,"Just like my title, I bought these for running because there were so many positive reviews but as soon as I started running with them in, they fell out. I kept on having to push them harder into my ears in a attempt for them to stay in for more than a few seconds. No such luck."
2,NOISY ear-bud,"this ear-bud was fallen off during workout, oh yeah, u can hear what happened around you and especially if you were in metro system, that all you would hear-the train running. what a waste."
4,Sensitive and yet fun (that is if you like purple),This is a beautifully crafted book of versesI purchased this book for my elderly mother as it typified her approach to life. She would be forever quoting sections from the book as her behaviour reflected a phrase or section from it. (and yes - she did wear purple!)It is a gentle reflection on ageing and how too often in our younger years we are driven by fad and fashion. I would thouroughly recommend it to anyone who has elderly parents - and to the parents themselves.
4,"Nice bowls,but oval not round","Nice blue bowls,but not multicolored as advertised and they are oval. They are all light blue with only the largest being a sort of tan colored on the outside. They are not microwavable! They have an extremely small footprint/base and are easily overturned. Easy to store and stack."
5,This is Shelby Lynne- The Best of the Epic Years,"I would rate this CD very high. Her cover on ""Little Bits and Pieces"" is absolutely tops. I have this song by Wayne Newton also and Shelby can sing circles around him on this song. On ""If I Could Bottle This Up"" her duet with the Great George Jones is simply superb.The other duet she does with Les Taylor ""The Very First Lasting Love"" is great too. But I can't leave out one of my favorites on the CD and that's ""Don't Get Around Much Any More"". I simply do not understand anyone who did not like this whole CD. I love her voice and think that the music industry is loco for not recognizing what a great talent she is."
3,?,"I have to be honest, I downloaded this ebook but I have not read it since, so i am not the best to give a comment, at least not yet, i have been so busy reading other stuff..."
1,Please do not publish this review,"I confused this with a movie about boys switched at birth and have eliminated all the text and now wish to withdraw the entire review. Editor, please do so. Thank you.There should be a simple way to just DELETE the entire review -- wish we had that option in addition to editing it. Something you might want to consider."
2,No much new info...,I am a person who is semi-obsessed with thte condition of her hair so I thought this would be a good book for me. It turns out that most of the hair advise was stuff I've already read in fashion magazines or stuff that didn't aply to me like hair loss. Oh well.
2,"seems good, but not for Nokia","Was pretty excited to get this for my Nokia 8260 since it seems pretty popular and the right form factor. However, I found when I received it that the volume was so low as to make it unusable despite the volume on the phone and the headset being turned to maximum. Much to my dismay I turn the package over and see ""Plantronics also offers headsets specifically for Nokia phones."" In this case, the M143-N1. So this phone is back to Amazon and I'll have to track down an M143 ..."
2,"Comfortable, but lacks sound quality","I bought this headset to replace the bud that came with my Treo 300. It is a comfortable headset, but the sound quality was poor compared to the Handspring OEM. Some friends claimed they had a hard time hearing me, and I found I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear others. I eventually returned it and am still looking for a better replacement."
3,Dress Forms,"This dress form can be suitable for early fashion designing, but not compared to professional ones. Although, I think this one is great!"
2,doesnt work in my hair,it wasnt moisturizing and im glad its so small regular gel..but didnt invest too mush in it....so i can use this as a regular drying gel :(
4,Defined curls for 4b Hair,"I really love this activator. Using it alone on my my hair which is very tightly coiled i get very well defined albeit small curls. I like this because it adds moisture, sheen and curl definition. I didn't give it 5 starts because the curls are still very tight whereas echo styler gives the curls more stretch and it is a bit sticky. This dries nicely and the sticky feeling goes away it also dries leaving behind moisturized, soft defined curls. Love this product. I buy from amazon and CVS its easy to get."
3,Functional but not top rate,"I like this product for its functionality, but sometimes it sticks and won't raise as it should, so it becomes a bother . . . especially when my daughter is trying to get the toilet paper out and it won't raise up for her."
5,Was Waiting For Lynn.....,"As I've followed Lynn's growth and teachings over the many years that she's written (I have an older copy of Medicine Women with the native women and crow on the front........pages have fallen apart, the cover taped back on, etc.), I was pleased when I came across this newer addition to her volume of work. In this book she descibes her feelings on what it's like to have an ailing parent and the process of death. She describes her on going search for answers which also proves that even for all she's learned, she still does not profess to have ""the truth"". Quite the contrary, she wonders about good and evil, duality, etc.. Her on-going relationship with Red Dog is put in a somewhat different light. It's almost a love hate relationship. A good read and very down to earth. What is interesting also is the process that was involved to write her first, Medicine Women."
3,Mozart,Gave this book as gift to my mom for Christmas. I myself read some excerpts from the book and was surprised at some of the letters that were written. It is interesting to find out more information about someone you didn't know a lot about.
1,not a good choice,"the probelm with this is that the weight of the mic piece pulls DOWN (because of gravity - or if you move it) and that cranks the piece over your ear into an unusable position... so it won't stay on your ear.plantronics makes another model where the mic piece rotates on the earpiece, so when you want to adjust it, you can hold the earpiece and then move the mic up/down independently. much better.i bought one of these M120's and absolutely could not use it.btw, i wear mine almost 10 hours a day.some friends say they ""can't"" wear something that fits over the ear... i think they just don't want to try it because they THINK it will bother them. Like anything, you can get used to it if you want to. I gain a TON of freedom with my phone in my shirt pocket and walking around with a headset."
4,Works as advertised,"The Linksys PLK200 Powerline AV Ethernet Adapter Kit arrrived. All I had to do to use it was to connect it. No complicated setups or anything.The unit does run hot, however that does not seem to effect its performance. I would hav e given it 5 stars if did not run hot."
4,works great but ...,once you get the devices configured and up and running you won't be diappointed. However getting it running with the poor documentation was a pain in the xxx. I did configure the security on it though so this added a level of complexity. I would suggest you do this too if you live in an condo or apt. otherwise don't bother.I wish it didn't cost so much too. The boxes feel cheap. I'm getting 50Mb on my knob and tube wiring. That's good enough for my DSL.
3,"Hardware seems okay, the software is junk",I just got these adapters because my wireless connection would just never be stable because of the house layout. They seem to be working fine for me but the configuration utility they give you just presents a grabled screen. The setup wizard was also bad and did not present clean screens. I had a live chat with a support person who said they had no known problems with the utility but they also did not have a current version on their website. If you need to do any configuration you are either going to have to be good at guessing or you or out of luck. I tried on two different XP systems with all the latest fixes and they both had the same problems. Hard to figure they did much real world testing.
1,powerline needs improvement,"I never could get it to work, despite hours of effort and contact with customer support, so I returned it. Their final input was that it wouldn't work for me because different electrical outlets I would use were on different circuit breakers in the main electrical panel. Find much discussion about implementation failure at the LinkSys customer forums."
2,Not as described,"I do not have a lot of money, so am buying some used books as Christmas presents. Most of the books have been exactly what I ordered. This book was listed as ""Used- Very good."" However the spiral binding is broken and gnarled. Shipping method was very protective, but this book is NOT in good condition. What the heck? I'm sending it back."
5,what a game,"I was amazed when i bought Morrowind and saw just how good it was. You can create a character from scratch, choose his/her race, class, skills, ECT. This game lets you do whatever you want. You don't have to finish the quest givin to you, u can just make up ur own quest. I have had it a while and my character is pretty much unstoppable. You can join guilds such as fighters, theives, mages, assassains, and criminal factions. This game is freakin awesome."
2,I just don't have the patience.,"Perhaps my attention span is shriveling up from the action genre of pc games, but I just couldn't sit still for this game. This could be a fabulous game playing experience, but I'll never know. I couldn't get through the first boring hour in Morrowind. Can my character move ANY slower?? I ran everywhere, then had to stop to restore fatigue. This may indeed be the gaming experience of someone's life, and the storyline, open ended gameplay and graphics do suggest that. I just think I have been forever spoiled by the likes of more exciting games, like NOLF, System Shock 2, Deus Ex, TR, Thief, Half-life, Unreal, AvP, etc. If I wanted mellow, I'd read a book."
3,"Morrowind, Bottom line","Here's the bottom line folks. Morrowind has Excellent graphics and the world is fantastically HUGE! Their are TONS of quests and places to explore. The downside to this game is as stated in an earlier review. The game is just too darn easy. You do the quests, you take your loot, your skills get better, and your level goes up. And by the time you hit level 10 or so (Which for me was quite early) you can take on basically ANYTHING in the game. The variety of monsters is very low. Essentially by the time you're 25% through the game, you've seen everything. I was very disapointed in this game."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,I bought this game about a week ago. at first i liked the game alot but after just a few hours of play it got to be the same thing over again. Also the game has a great tendancy to lock up so if you havent saved latley u might find yourself doing many things again.the game is very openended but you must be careful about what you do or touch cause u may need it later in the game also the land scap is huge and you can walk around for hours looking for a single thing. this game was worth buying if you like RPG. just remeber with this game it is easy to get side tracked and forget what you where doing there is no structure to the game and the main plot has no more importance than the side tasks you do so if you are looking for story line this is not the game for you but if you are into wondering around pointlessly this is the game for you.
4,Simply amazing!,"Do you like Role Playing games? The pick up a copy of elders scroll III: morrowind. The the game mentions you you can do anything you want, there not lieing. Theres a basic game mission but you can stop that and play the missions to the side... theres over 300 of them. You can kill just about anybody you want... as long as you can win the fight( watch out for some old looking female dark elves in town, they can put up a great fight). You can steal anything with value and sometimes stuff without value... ive practicaly robbed the first town of all there lighting. I took all the travelers lights off houses and buildings... but watch out, the game does know right from wrong and you can break the law... unless of course knowones watching. To sum it up it's a great game... it's true, fighting gets dull quick but the graphics, sound, and the rest of the gameplay is [great!]"
3,Disappointment,"This game provides for smart, open-ended gameplay with unlimited possibilities and realistic NPCs, however, the graphics is seriously lacking. This causes combat, a large part of RPGs, to be sub-standard and ruins a portion of open-ended play."
1,I absolutely hated this game!,This is the worst game i have ever purchased and played. The graphics sucked horribly and they gave me a headache if i played for more than 15 minutes. Nothing looked even remotely realistic. The controls were horrible as well. I spent the first hour dieing over and over again because no matter how many times i stabbed an enemy in the face it never lost health. That made me extremely irritated. Plot was boring as well. It was the worst waste of money i have ever spent and i don't recommend this game to anyone. Over all i give it a 1 out of 5 only because i cant give it any lower. :(
3,It's not bad or anything,"This game isin't bad or anything its unbelievably open and a million different options of what to be and what to do but I find and especially when I looked at the guide its about 90% of the time just going to someone and them telling you to do somthing or get somthing and then walking for like a year and a half to find or do whatever it is they want then you go back and they just have another thing for you to do Now don't get me wrong its not a bad game or anything but its just not an impressively cool game I liked it alot at first its cool being able to steal stuff or become and imperial guard but when you get down too it, its a little repetetive so anyways its fun and all but I would definitely rent it first and play it for a week or so and save your progress on your xbox if you like it thats just my opinion"
1,Horrible Game!,"I rented this game and played it for about 30 minutes, it was the worst game I have ever played! Well, maybe not the worst, but I had more fun playing Pong. The graphics are horrible, the freedom thing is bad, combat is the worst ever, and there are so many more cons."
3,Just barely misses the mark..,"Conrad Allen's first book of the George Porter Dillman series, is an OK historical mystery. It's set in 1907 on the maiden voyage of the Lusitiana, the pride of the Cunard Line. There is some international intrigue abroad, as Germany moves closer to war with Great Britain, and then there is our hero, George P. Dillman, an American private detective that is undercover. On baord, he mets Violet Rymer, who is under the thumb of her overbearing, control-freak father, and he meets the mysterious Genevieve Mansfield, who is running from her shady past. Allen manages to disappoint us with Violet's would-be suitor, and we don't really ever get to really understand a few of the characters. That, and the uber-obnoxious Barcroft character really turned me off of what could have been a great read."
3,"scholarly, but not good enough for my paleobiology class","Very expensive book not to use color. Although fossils are discussed adequately, it does not do the job for a student who needs to learn the distinguishing characteristics of some 200 fossils in a semester. Almost overwhelming in scope, but it needs to be for a demanding class."
3,Not the greatest,"I personally feel Benton's book leaves an abundant more it be answered. The book does have such good points like as to the photo's and diagrams presented in the text, but the book is written with a higher learning in mind that might leave the common reader wondering what they just read. I have read far better books than this one , and I recommend it only for students of paleology or seasoned veterans in the field."
1,"Interesting interviews, outdated information","Many of the techniques described in this book are yesterday's techniques. Tables for precise layout? C'mon -- what about Cascading Style Sheets?The video chapter is a particular embarrassment. No coverage of QuickTime 3.0's ability to deliver movies for different bandwidths. And the AFI may use VDO, but no one else does! Realvideo and Netshow are FAR more popular.Read this book for a look at how some designers do things. But don't read it if you're looking for the most current information."
3,"Useful in some parts, lacking in others","Some web development topics are covered nicely, but the book as a whole is somewhat disorganized and in places lacking. Much of the graphic information is Photoshop-specific. Both the reader level and the preface imply that the book is not for beginners to HTML, but fully into the book (Chapter 5), basic tags are discussed.On the bright side, there are a few good tidbits compiled from designers of some impressive sites, and it is a quick read."
3,Not much depth,"I was looking for a book that would give suggestions about what looks good from a web perspective. I selected this book because I though it would be good to see the issue from several different points of view. Unfortunately, none of the interviews really give a good explanation or method to designing a web site."
3,Hmm....,"Personally I like his first CD better, I don't yet own ether one but I have heard songs from both and I like the first CD's songs better"
5,Great Product,"I love these measuring spoons. With the colors I can find the right size immediately. I also like that it comes with a 1/3 & 1/4 tsp, many sets don't."
3,"Sizes Don't Fit Jar Openings, and that is Annoying!","Teaspoon measure is too big to fit in almost any of my herb and spice jars, so I have to knock the spices out onto the spoon. Not efficient. I love the color, and the in between sizes."
3,Ashamed of the Amazon.com Editorial Review,"I cannot get over Amazon's editorial reviewer saying ""In the absence of Dennis DeYoung... blah, blah, blah""... if it wasn't for DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and JY wouldn't even be close to the successes that they are now. STYX is not STYX without Dennis DeYoung and shame on the reviewer for saying something so idiotic."
5,Styx Live,If your a Styx fan then you're going to love this show. It's great video and audio production and the band and kids just nailed it that night.
4,Kids playing with Styx,"First saw this on HD TV. Searched for the DVD, and found it on Amazon. Fun to watch and great music. Uniquely choreographed, live, Styx plays along with the Youth Orchestra and they all look like they are having fun. Would recommend this to a Styx fan."
5,Wonderful Concert,Even if you are not a Styx fan you will enjoy this concert! The Contempary Youth Orchestra and Styx put on a performance that you will enjoy again and again. It will give you goose bumps!!
1,Overrated,"I chose this product over others that were recommended because of some of the glowing reviews I'd read. I'm afraid after about a month of constant usage, I find this product to be way overrated than what some of the reviews here said it would be. The sound and microphone quality was inferior compared to a similar Panasonic headset I'd tried out after getting frustrated with the poor quality I was getting. I initially thought it was because of my DECT handset, but after testing different headset models on the same DECT handset, the difference in sound quality was too obvious for me to not notice.I'd suggest this product only if you have a very quiet environment to use this in , otherwise chances are you will not be able to hear or speak to the person on the other end very well."
3,Head to head comparison... and lost.,I bought this along with the panasonic kx-tca60 to compare them head to head. The sound quality was decent and it was not uncomfortable. But I called several people who said that the treble or sharpness bothered their ear and it sounded like a bad intercom at a fast food joint. I kept the panasonic and gave this one away.
1,A REAL PIECE OF JUNK,"I bought this headphone to use with a Panasonic KXTG2500 cordless phone, and found it to be a huge disappointment. By itself, the Panasonic phone is fine, but with this headset, the sound quality is extremely bad, to the point of embarrassing: people on the other end of the call almost always volunteer a comnent about the poor sound is. As if that's not enough, the headset arrived with a tear in the padding on the ear-piece... Nothing but junk."
1,Not worth the shipping costs,"I bought this headset to use with my cordless panasonic phone. I pluged it into my home phone and was Very surprised when it ruined my phones they no longer work I have to put them on speaker to hear anyone now. The headset fit but all I could hear was a fuzzy sound, now I have two panasonic phones that I can hardley stand to use. I don't remember seeing a warning that these are not compatable with my phones. Can you please replace my phones or do I now need to spend another 100.00 for new phones? My phones are only 4mo's old.Please get back to me about what you can do for me.Thanks,Rachelle, Burlingame, CA"
5,phone worker,I need reliability in my phones as a phone worker. I have multiple phone tools here should 1 fail & this seems to be working out well.
2,Wasn't too impressed,"I tried this headset with my LG mobile phone, and I constantly had a hard time hearing the person on the other line. I also didn't like the ""switchboard operator"" style headset -- too much of a hassle for use on the road, and too big to easily fit in the glove box. Might be ok for someone at an office desk. I switched to a Body Glove over-the-ear style system -- better sound, more compact and convenient."
3,"Fun Costumes, Boring Main Character","I didn't know much about Queen Victoria's story prior to seeing this movie, so I was a little disappointed by the actual story. Coming into the movie, I was expecting an Elizabeth-like story, where a female ruler helps set England on the right path. That was anything but the case. Instead, I found Victoria to be a bit of a weak character and it made it hard for me to really enjoy the story. As well, the plot was a bit slow and a little boring as there was very little action throughout the movie."
5,Emily Blount is great!!,"Considering this is based on a true event, this a wonderful love story. To take a bullet for someone you love has to be the most unselfish test of true love. Lovely scenery and gowns a must see for victorian fans."
2,Underwhelming,"Yes, the costumes and sets were gorgeous.Still, The Young Victoria is inaccurate in several instances and the plot disappears. When the movie was over, all I could think was, ""This is it?""I also didn't enjoy the harlequin romance-style relationship presented between Albert and Victoria. The movie was great until someone decided that there was a need to throw in a few arguments for entertainment's sake. Conflicts were never resolved between Victoria and Albert in this film. If there is a point to making up material to put in a historical film...well, at least follow through and make it work.Ugh. I was very disappointed."
2,If Only It was a Whole Movie,"This is a delightful and accurate historical drama/romance that, unfortunately, has a vague beginning and a non-existent ending. The actors (especially Jonathan Firth as Albert) are flawless, the sets and costumes are magnificent and the direction is superb. Sadly, accuracy and beauty were substituted for plot. Humans don't LIVE lives with a beginning, a middle and an end - things that are essential to a good movie. In this amazingly accurate portrayal of V&A's love story, they forgot that they were actually making a movie. If you want a study in how to present real people in an utterly realistic way hundreds of years after their deaths, this is your movie. If you want a story, a plot, a movie, you will be better served by other, less-accurate films."
2,Young Victoria Arrives Safely,"The DVD Young Victoria arrived in fine condition, carefully packaged.We are looking forward to viewing it."
5,THE BEGINNING OF AN IMPERIAL LEGEND,"VICTORIA REGINA iMPERTRIX, IS THE SECOND OF BRITAINS GOLDEN MONARCHS THAT LENT THEIR NAMES TO AGES.THE WOMEN THEMSELVESAND THE EFFECT THEY CREATE BY THEIR PRESENCE IS IN ITSELF A GREAT STORY FIE ACTORS & ACTRESSES ARE NOT ONLY VERY ENRTERTAINING BUT ENGROSSING. THIS LITTLE MOVIE IS ONE OF THESE GEMS!"
5,Amazing and Engrossing,"Amazing film. I am not really an Emily Blunt fan, but she is great in the role of Victoria. She makes her very strong and likable, but isn't afraid to make her annoying at times as is called for by the story. I cheered at some points, and cried out in dismay at other times (A good thing- it was suspenseful and engrossing)."
5,Young Victoria,"Loved this movie- a lot of history that is factual and a great love story. A visual pleasure to behold- palaces, wardrobe, and scenery. A+"
3,Not as good as it could have been.,"The story line was fast and loose with the truth, I prefer the facts, and not someone's version of what might have been."
3,True Indian,"The readers who are interested in knowing the world and the great people then it's for them.Well,In my view Gandhi was great but he screwed the country India by dividing to Pakistan.This book tells only great thing about him but no critics at all."
2,"Good program, lousy compatibility","The program itself is quite good for an intermediate player like myself. However, it does not run on my Win2K machine at all. I loaded it on my Windows XP machine, but this isn't much better. The game runs, but has a habit of locking up the PC unexpectedly and randomly in the middle of games. I plan to ask for my money back."
3,Not compatible with Windows 2000,"Yes, CM7000 is pretty great. But, it works only poorly under Win2K. Lots of other programs that work on 98 and NT work just fine under Win2K, but not Chessmaster 7000. It pisses me off, because Chessmaster 8000 isn't supported on Windows 2000 either -- although the website says that it should work, it's just not supported. Also, beware the 1.0.6 update, available on the website; it took my installation of CM7000 from working poorly to not working at all. On the other hand, the games analyzed and *narrated* by Josh Waitzkin are fantastic."
3,Beginners Only,"It is annoying that the hype says this is the ""number one"" chess computer game. It clearly is not, and the serious player should consider games such as those produced by Rebel (....) I find there is something amaturish about this game, and why does it STILL not run on windows 2000?"
1,Boring,"This movie could have been so much better with the plot listed on the back of the dvd.Well,it wasn't.I couldn't wait for it to end.Such a subject""The Holocaust"" has been made into such fantastic films.This is not one of them."
1,It made me sleepy.,"How can such a terrible time in history be portraid in such a boring way, a farm full of nut cases, even the kid was unbalanced, I wanted to slap Susan silly!, get a grip!, start living for now!, a great cast, except for Susan, wasted! I bet the book is a crashing bore also, I hope to see no more ""nutty"" movies like this."
1,Do not purchase this DVD,"This DVD is presenting day one of two seminars days. Day two is often referred to on the DVD (day one) as the day when Mr. Pearls teaches how to apply his healing on yourself and others. Day two of the seminar is not on the DVD and the essential part of the procedure is missing. Consequently you are purchasing a demoe for a new seminar to fill in what you are looking for. The DVD should inform about that, but does not. In addition, Mr. Pearls drive to be funny about everybody and anything else (in his direct way) just adds to the poor quality of this DVD in regard to presenting something of practical value to the viewer."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Whilst the interview is great, I thought is was a bit pricey for a copy of a TV interview that goes for half hour 40 mins."
4,Not too bad a starting point...,"Unlike the former reviewer, I understand that cats can have dairy product in moderation (presuming one's cat has no lactose intolerance) so didn't find that aspect of the book disturbing. These are to be ""treats"" after all, not regular dining experience. Also, since I love to cook, the extra time spent on some of these treats is worth the effort because I will know exactly what is in them (unlike storebought treats)!"
2,average,You need space to dance and jump around. Good for a single person living alone. I recommend a yoga video or other workout video.
1,waste of money,It's not what I was expecting. I thought this would have cool and fast bollywood steps.
5,terry gross is ours! she's a philadelphia treasure and you can't have her!,"but you can listen to ""fresh air"".....you can find it on the net i am sure, it's produced at whyy in philadelphia. terry is one of a kind, a good kind, a great and unique interviewer. i have been listening to terry for about 35+ years, and i remember rushing out to my car to hear what music she was playing that day to open her show. we may disagree on some music that she plays now, i always thought the old jazz was so cool. but terry is cool, and i think you haven't really lived until you've heard her giggle....and then ask such a penetrating question that her guest always says: that was a great question. guests on her show say that alot. we love terry here, and it's time you found out why. yes, read her book, but listen to the show a few times, and see if you aren't hooked like a fish......she's got to be the best interviewer ever. and has the best giggle. you'll see....check it out....."
2,Rational Recordings,"Marc Gauthier, Very interesting review and I'm interested in a CD of the songs you had recorded. Please let me know how to contact you. I see a member of the band every day in Ann Arbor. If I can be of any help let me know."
5,Only Buy this Doumbek!!!!,"I recently took a trip to Israel and went to so many places looking for the perfect doumbek. I have spoken to many famous doumbek players, the doumbek player for Kobi Peretz, Eyal Golan, MOshe Peretz..... this doumbek sounds like the doumbeks they use. IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!! the sound is amazing the case fits perfect and it comes with an extra head..... BUY THIS DOUMBEK!!!!!!!"
4,Cushion,"The cushion arrived and I am using it in my easy chair. It's agreat fit and puts me up high enough to get out of the chair,easily."
4,Good resource for collectors and students,Well-illustrated (including color images) guide to those regions in the U.S. where petrified wood can be found. They're not all out west; some locations may be closer to you than you think... Petrified wood provides an interesting side collection for those interested in either fossils and minerals.
5,Celine Dion by MArianne McKAy,"The best book ,clear vivid pictures,precisely written.Each page is interesting,easy to read.It's a great book,every Celine fan should have,or even if this was not Celine,how this book compiled was IMPRESSIVE!!"
1,Garbage,"I was skeptical when i bought this and that skepticism was justified after applying it to my gun. It lost its stickiness quickly, became a mess if it touched itself and is not good as very small pieces. This particular color is horrible and im not sure what it was meant to blend in with."
2,Pump didnt fit my 289,I bought this pump cause it was advertised for a 289 engine. I have a 1967 Ford Mustang with a 289 engine and the pump did not fit.
5,Not just the Elmo part is good!,"While Elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video, that is not the only good thing about this one. It features several shorts with cartoons and different characters. My favorite part of the video (and my daughter's) is the part featuring Ernie and Bert. Ernie decides he is going to be a doctor, and needs Bert's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do. Bert just wants to know if he is healthy, and after putting him through several tests, Ernie says that he doesn't know if Bert is healthy or not because he isn't a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not! The cartoons are funny, and there is a never before seen Elmo's World at the end all about doctors, too. Very cute!"
5,Awesome!!,Wow and Flutter is the best CD I've bought this year. Every song on the CD will touch you in some way. Wow & Flutter contains some of the best pop tunes I've heard in a long time. If you haven't discovered Kyle Vincent yet -- Buy this CD!!!
3,"Muddy Sound, Creative Mixes, Rare Performances","Almost like a bootleg, one only notices the muddy sound at first, but quickly adjusts. It is particularly noticeable in side-by-side comparisons of other performances of the same songs. Yet this is a rare document of the tour where the great King was mere opener to the upstart Tool, and contains some of the earliest manifestations of some works that would re-appear, somewhat transmogrified, later. Worth the price if only for the very creative and humorous mix of ""Dangerous Curves""."
1,Read it before...is that legal?,"I read your book after reading How to Spot a Dangerous Man and I have to say, I'm contacting the publisher for a full refund. I had no idea they allowed copying from another author. Your book was a blatant rip off of the other book. Maybe YOU need some therapy..."
5,Sacks stuns again,"If you have any interest in the brain, you've got to read Sacks. These stories are a great entry into thinking seriously about how the mind works. From a neurologist's perspective, but with a philosopher's depth of understanding, Sacks uses unusual cases of brain malfunction (though it is not always dysfunctional) to highlight how the ""normal brain"" works. The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat and this one are great collections of essays."
4,Perfectly Stupid. Which Is The Whole Point.,"For too long, ""one hit wonder"" compilations have focused on the 60s, 70s and 80s. This one brings us up to date by showcasing the musical flashes in the pan over the past 25 years.Best of all, these ARE the versions of the songs you remember -- unlike some of those horrible ""re-recorded"" versions you'll come across on compilations from time to time.This 2-cd set is guaranteed to have 2 or 3 perfect songs to include in your next party mix...for laughs, if nothing else. However, there are definitely are some that will get some booties on the dance floor."
1,Probably my mistake. Didn't realize it was jazz.,May I return these CDs for credit? Not the kind of music I was looking for. Wanted balads as bockground dinner music.
5,Best Classical Movie,"It is one of the best Hosterical movies I have ever seen. I was pleased with the copy I purchesed from Amazon, because it is very clear and well product."
3,Stagey and poorly-paced,"The Bottom Line:This 1953 version of Julius Caesar can boast a terrific rendering of Marc Antony's famous speech (and Brutus is an honorable man!) but that's the natural high point of the film which unfortunately continues on for another 40 minutes or so; it's tempting to recommend the film on the basis of that one speech alone but I can't, what with the lacking performance by James Mason as Brutus (who, despite the title, is the main character of the film) and pitiful sets which seem like they were put together an hour before shooting.2.5/4"
5,All Hail Caesar!!!,"and this magnificent production of one the Bard's most memorable plays. This movie boasts an all star cast, and each do a splendid job of portraying their characters, my favorite being John Geilgud, one of the all-time great Shakespearean actors who's Cassius is an emotional boilerplate of envy. James Mason's Brutus is his friend and exact emotional opposite: a self-controlled, even-tempered, honor-loving man. Watching the interplay of these two opposites was for me the most thrilling part of the movie. I can't imagine any actors playing these roles other than Mason and Geilgud. Also, Brando's Mark Antony was marvelous to behold. How he skillfully moves the crowd to riot was nothing less than a virtuoso display of acting that proves Brando to be the genius that he was.If you like Shakespeare, and particularly 'Julius Caesar', but haven't seen this one yet, BUY IT, you won't be disappointed."
2,"Eh, if your into books","I mainly use the internet for how to's on certain vehicle info I need. Between forums and videos people post, i usually don't even pick it up."
2,Copy Protected,"The course is great in essence, but there are two major trade-offs:1. I was unable to rip the whole set into iTunes - and put it on my iPod. That was very annoying! (But, maybe, that was just me being unable.)2. Some syllables are difficult to distinguish (is it ending with n or with m?) when you have nothing in written.Besides that, I really enjoyed the course, and I'd recommend it when you can overcome said two issues."
1,Hartz is great if you want to kill your pet.,"Don't use Hartz products of any kind on your pets. It is not worth the risk. There are many cases of this and many of the other Hartz products killing or causing serious health problems for pets. Some report neurological problems, respiratory problems, hair loss, rashes, and death. Visit Hartzvictims.org for more information"
2,keep looking...,"This was the only hairball remedy for sale at the local Walmart, so after checking reviews here I decided to give it a try.Pros: Slight reduction in hairballs (my long-haired cat went from coughing up a hairball about every other day to one every 3-4 days). But even using it daily, I haven't been able to completely get rid of them with this product (I also brush her, bathe her frequently, etc)Cons: My cat HATES this stuff. If I'm lucky, I can sneak up on her when she's napping and put a glob on her paw (its quite runny), but once she realizes what I've done, she'll jump up and run to hide for the rest of the night - usually flinging some of the gel all over my apartment. And if I'm not lucky, I have to pull her out from under the couch... not quite my idea of fun.I'm going to keep looking, hopefully they'll like something else better."
1,No consequences,The writer allows young readers to believe that there are no consequences for their actions on the TV show. These are not the values and life lessons I want my child to learn.
1,Proof-reading is soooo much trouble!,"Never have I seen such a poorly proof-read edition of so fine a book. It's criminal. Page 61 has legendary mountain man Hugh Glass being killed by hostile Indians in the ""winter of 1932-33."" That would have made the poor guy over 140 years old at the time. And that's just the beginning. There are over 15 typos in the first five chapters alone, which would disqualify this publisher (Comstock Editions) as the operator of a Quick-Copy franchise.Great book! But you're going to have to track down a much earlier edition in order to appreciate it."
2,lack of quality control,"This is my second headset I have bought. With the first one, the wires separated from the plug which is unrepairable. The second one I bought, the plug fell apart, literally, within 5 days of purchase.. I'm keeping it together with tape. I contacted them to return it but they wanted the box it came in, which I don't have. The cordless phone works great, but the headsets are not very good."
1,Buy a different product!,"This is my third Plantronics headset and each had a mute that didn't work and the background noise is so bad as to make the unit unusable. It sounds fine on my end, but the people I'm talking to say that the background noise hurts their ears and they can't hear me properly. When I hit mute, they can still hear me talking. Now that's a real embarrassment! This unit is not useful at any price. I have returned the units and I'll look elsewhere. One time is a fluke. More than that means they've got a defective product."
2,Excellent Call Quality but Poor Durability,"Generally, I'm a big fan of Plantronics. I've had one of their Supra (commercial grade headsets) for going on 10 years. It's a wonderful product.Unfortunately my experience with the M175 has been less than stellar. I've purchased several over the last few years and they all start out working great. Really outstanding. But after about 6 months they gradually begin to stop working.I've called their technical support department several times and been told by representatives that they've never heard of such a problem. Frankly I'm a bit dubious. I suspect there's some sort of design flaw with this product."
4,Great Value,I'm using this headset with a Vtech cordless phone and love it. Good sound and microphone volume. I really like the mute feature. Highly recommend it.
2,Poor Manufacturing flaw makes this product less than stellar,"What can I say? This product is great. I used it flawlessly with my Vtech cordless phone for about 6 months.I had the SAME problem as one of the earlier reviewers:He said:""Unfortunately, the wires broke or came loose where they connect to the headset. Guess I'll have to buy me a new one.""Really Plantronics. This kind of design flaw is simply unacceptable!"
3,"Bad Wire/great voice,sound/biodegradeable wiring?","I am buying my 3rd and 4th set today. This unit would be perfect except the wiring splits, peels, cracks and breaks internally. It really deserves heavier gauge wireing or heavy duty wire insulation, or just plain old shielded cable would hold up just fine. I'm buying a replacement plus an extra one because it's a great headset while it lasts, between 4 to 6 months of office use.If anyone out there knows of a headset with the voice/sound quality equal to this one but with better construction please email me... I've tried Sony but my customers could not here me."
1,Buyers Beware - It's 3.5 mm Jack (not 2.5 mm),"I work from home and use my home phone at least 3 to 4 hours a day. I have Panasonic and have used Panasonic headsets previously. After I cycled through two of them, I decided to give this one a try. I just got it in the mail and it has 3.5 mm jack. My home phone takes 2.5mm jack. There is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so I relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone. I also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter 3.5 to 2.5 mm. I did not get that so this is useless for me.I will be contacting the vendor for a return. Disappointing!"
1,Too flimsy,I was surprised that Plantronics wasn't as good as I remembered it being. It was annoying and just generally too flimsy. The headpiece was brittle and broke within the first six months.Neither did it ever really adjust so as to be comfortable enough to leave on while working and not using the phone.
1,"Poor quality, again.","I bought a Plantronics cordless cordless unit and headset five years ago, both were flawless 'till the headset cord shorted.This is the second Plantronics replacement headset I've bought, and they've both been useless. The M214C had unacceptable mic volume, no one could hear me. This one has a pulsing distortion noise in the earphone, unacceptable again.Guess I'll just cut the short out of my old cord.I wish I'd bought it at Amazon, so I could just drop the return in the mail like the other one."
4,You can hear me now!,"The thing I like best about this headset is the ability to control both the speaker's and the listener's volume, especially that of the listener. My 86 year old aunt no longer keeps telling me to speak up! It's also comfortable, particularly the piece that rests against the head. I would definitely recommend it - it's a great product for the money!"
4,Great.....if it holds up,"I have been using for daily for one week, with a 900MHz cordless home / office phone. When my old headset died, I actually tried a cheap $20 brand-X replacement headset.....mistake. Returned it, and decided to try the mythic Plantronics name.PRO:- Excellent sound quality sending and receiving- All day comfort in headset mode. Have actually forgotten to remove it a couple times already.- Useful control features (mute, receiving volume, and sending output volume)- Good industrial design (i.e. cool looking + mike boom is not too long)CON:- Concerns about durability. The cable thickness and lack of robust strain relief looks like a potential for sudden failure. Considering this the top of the line, I would have expected better from Plantronics.- Value (paid $45 locally). Cost more than the phone itself.If it lasts awhile, I expect to be a happy customer. For $30 on Amazon, I see little downside, and probably no better product for the intended use."
1,Don't Buy This Headset ! Microphone is inadequate .,"We bought this headset recently and returned it the same day it arrived. The microphone does not sit close enough to your mouth to pick up your voice . We tried it both over your ear and on the headband but neither method worked well enough to locate the microphone close enough to your mouth to make quality calls. All the callers we talked to with this headset said they could hardly hear us. When you use this headset you will lose about 60% of your voice volume going out to the callers you are talking to and there are no volume controls that will help the situation.My advice is to pay a little more and find a headset that places the microphone infront of your mouth to pick up your voice much better , those you call will appreciate that you did."
1,junk,i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well. the one i bought at the dollar store worked better. then i find out amazon will not will not back up there products after 30 days. what a learning experience. knowing this i will never buy from amazon again. keep this in mind when purchasing a product from this company.
2,"static, poor sound quality","Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound. I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions. Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality."
5,College Chemistry Text Book,"This book does a good job of presenting material in a precise manner. Two classes at my college are taught out of this text book and I was amazed at how thin it was. It is not at all a heavy, bulky book but it still does an excellent job of explaining material and providing useful problems."
1,JUNK,POWER HOOKS ARE JUNK! If you have big hands forget about using these cheaply made products. Very uncomfortable to use. DO NOT BUY!!
5,Go For It!,"So inexpensive! Sure, it is not top quality, but at less than 7 bucks, including postage, and weather-proof polyester, it is just what I wanted. How can you go wrong? MOST important...totally problem-free transaction. Hey, who wants online ordering hassles, right?"
3,Got what I paid for.,"This is ok for the price. The headphones are cheap, but then, that's what I paid, I guess. If I had it to do over again, I'd just go down to Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, Staples, really anywhere."
2,Built in Speakers are Useless,The speakers built in to the CD Player are very quiet and low quality (I could barely even hear the music and watt I did hear was crackly). So I sent it back for a refund (I all ready had a personal CD player that I had to use headphones with).
3,alot of info,"This dvd had many different scale types shown relatively rapidly. I felt it didn't spend time explaining in detail. It is great as an overview of the various types of scales, but lacks if you are looking, as I was, as a beginner."
5,Much more than just band-aids,"I was looking for a general all-purpose first aid kit to have on hand while around the home, camping, on picnics, etc. This provided exactly what I was looking for. Most of the kits in my initial search were nothing more than a collection of different band-aids and aspirins in a box. This kit goes the next step beyond band-aids with gauze, tape, cold pack, scissors, tweezers, and more. Now I feel much better prepared for the unexpected emergencies, whether its pulling out splinters, covering an injured eye, or treating a blister."
2,Not as stable as I'd hoped,"I guess whether or not you like this item depends a lot on what you plan to use it for. I wanted it as a microwave cart. It was one of only a handful of items I could find which was the right size for my big microwave and limited space. But when I got it together, I found it wasn't stable enough for me to trust the microwave to. The microwave stays on the counter. The cart provides a small amount of additional ""counter"" space. I'd have returned it, but I didn't want to go through that hassle, and besides I couldn't find anything else that I'd have liked better.It was very easy to put together without tools, which was how it was designed to be. However, I think that very fact is why I found it so unstable. I'd rather have spent a little time messing with a screwdriver.One thing I do like is that it's almost exactly the same height as my kitchen counters, and close to the same width. So it does feel almost like an extension to the counter."
1,Lighting for Video,"When this book arrived I was so disappointed. It's old fashioned and uses a doll as the subject to be lighted. It's expensive and the information is not that clear or easily understood. I sent the book back same day it arrived. Not worth the price. There are far better books at better price. The only reason it has one star, had to to get the review up."
4,"All of the Above, yet awkward.","This book was a plethora of useful knowledge. However, it wasn't a jump in and get dirty type of title. When starting the path towards EJB/J2EE coding, one needs to do less messing around with devshed pre-coded examples, and learn by doing.This text references proprietary JAR packages from the authors. It is my feeling that APress let down the beginning J2EE/EJB programmer here. This book is not for the beginner java programmer -Repetition goes far when learning a new area of any language.Bottom Line:If you want to get up and go and are good at installing all the pre-defined jargon (or are highly skilled with guesswork) and just want some great examples, this book is great for You. If you prefer the repetition route, look elsewhere.- Hope this helps."
3,Too much for one book,"The effort was made to cover too broad a material. As the result, explanations are often superficial and missing the point."
1,Not Good.,"This is my first Jack Higgins book. I was really disappointed. The saving grace is that the book is very short.The plot is bad and predictable. The characters are not interesting. But most of all, the plot doesn't make sense. Bad, bad, bad. The book gets one star because I did finish."
5,To become a classic . . . .,"It's one of those books you will NOT be able to put down once you start. It's one of those books that will make you cry with sorrow AND cry with joy. It's one of those books that will inspire you to pursue your calling. It's one of those books that will make you question your ""comfort zone"". It's one of those books that expose the sadness and ignorance of our nation (both behind and in-front-of the walls). It's one of those books that will ""effect dramatic change toward harmony in our culture"" when/if we allow ourselves to be as compassionate, brave, and committed as Dr. Bob Roberts. IT'S A MUST READ!"
5,My favorite bass CD!,"Wow - this is simply amazing and emotional bass playing! I've never heard another bass player (apart from Edgar Meyer) with this much soul AND perfect intonation! Where did this guy come from? Is he well known? Is he one of the climber's on the cover, as well?"
5,Dolly Dearest,This seller is great! The movie/dvd was in great condition. Dolly dearest is a Great horror classic. Like female Chucky dolls with an ancient evil twist. A definite watch or must see film.
1,Awful,"This movie's only asset is its gimmicky name. There is nothing scary or gory about this movie in the least. It's not even funny. In other words, it fails on all counts as a horror movie. I can appreciate almost any type of horror movie, good, bad, funny, campy, so bad it's good, etc. This movie doesn't qualify as any of these and is totally boring. Avoid at all costs!!"
1,Dolly Dearest,The movie is painfully slow. The acting is bad and the picture quality is bad as well. The first hour goes by with barely anything happening but the last half hour has some good stuff going on. I'd diffently skip this movie and watch the Child's Play series or the Twilight Zone with Talking Tina. This film sucked.
2,Doesn't smell like I remember,I remember a clean sweet smell but this was more soapy and spicy. Very strong. I'm moving on from this fragrance. There's better versions out there. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. I still will not purchase again.
1,Do not buy,This horn is the biggest piece of krap next to a pile of dog mess that I have ever seen in my life. The thing is un believably low toned you can't hardly hear it. Let alone use it to motivate a jerk texting on his phone. I spent 180 dollars on this from my local speed shop. Who's the joke on now. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!
5,As Mr. Kerwick says,"I too read this book in 1982 and from time to time have thought about it over the years. Now in the year 2000 I find myself fairly stunned at how accurately Kahn predicted the future. Books about the future were common in the 70's and 80's, Future Shock, Club of Rome, Greening of America and so on, but none so clearly predicted the world we have today.Mr. Kerwick has said it better than I can. If the book is out of print, try looking in zShops, there is a copy of it there now."
3,It's OK,"if you are doing a PhD in the US, I wouldn't bother with this. Some of the chapters are decent, others are filled with fluff."
5,My PhD hand luggage,"A very good book for the ones who intend to apply to a PHd. It describes real academic life problems and propose actions to minimize the impact of those problems in the final goal.I'm going to apply to a PhD within few months, so it is included on my hand luggage."
4,healpfull but not great,it has alot of usefull information tells hiow to take out side markers and fender trun signial indicators and other difficult items a good buy if you can find it a a reasonable price
2,Not for parents of identicals,"This isn't a bad book for parents of fraternal twins, but I found nothing in it that dealt with the issues that can arise with identical twins. I am still trying to find a book that deals more specifically with raising identicals."
1,Boring.....,"I was really excited about reading about Cher's sexcapades over the years, all the men, all the wild times, to get to know the real woman who is the diva we all know as Cher. Who better to tell it than her daughter? All the reviews here talked about Chastity's ""honesty."" What a bust! Chastity was honest all right, honest about her own boring life. Who cares! There was hardly any content on Cher at all. At least she could have tossed in some Greg Allman stuff, or a few tid-bits on Rob Camiletti a/k/a the Bagel Boy. No! Not a word! All it was was some boring tale about Chastity's life as a lesbian. Sorry, that holds no interest for me. If you don't have any interest in Cher, this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away!"
4,The End Of Innocence,"I haven't finished it yet. But its excellent. I'm supposed to write between 75 and 300 words. But I prefer to make reviews short, and sweet."
1,Left much to be desired,"I thought by reading this book, I could learn something from the journey Chastity has taken thru life. However, not much to learn here. Although I admire her love for Joan, there wasn't much to take away except the sense that I may have wasted my time and money."
1,Poor Taste,How can you possibly write a children's book and include a snake in a child's bedroom. Natalie Standiford needs her head examined.
4,cool,"this cd is awesome.... its got excerpts from the movie which are annoying once youve already heard them once.... but if you like punk then i'd buy this. Actually just buy""freak faggots drunx and junkies"" which is half of this cd anyway."
3,Not loud enough,"I was looking for a back-up alarm for my E250 so I bought this based on the other reviews that said it was loud, it is not. Yes it does make a beep beep sound but not the beep beep sound I am looking for. I wanted more of a beep beep you hear on commercial vans/ trucks. This thing sounds like a sim-loud alarm clock taped to the back of my van. The only reason I gave it 3 star instead of 1 star is because it does beep and when it comes to safety a low beep is better than no beep.Edit: I have remove this alarm and installWolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm, Loud 97 Decibel - 12-24 Volt. If you are looking for a more commercial truck beep beep then I would recommend the wolo."
3,It's just OK,"The beep sound is not as robust as I wanted it to be. While not feminine, it's somewhere in between. I paid $30 to get it installed at my local auto shop. It does the job I guess."
2,Why can't I make good espresso from this machine?,"I freely admit that user error may be my problem here. I owned a Starbucks machine and finally decided to ""upgrade"". I had bought a machine for my parents and loved that I know longer had to prime the machine before every service. And I didn't have to call the manufacturer every three weeks when it vapor locked for no apparent reason at all.Having said all of that, my parents' machine (which is not this one and was $140) made great espresso. My machine could not seal, was difficult to set up and almost always leaked. As well, the frother is really a bit of a pain in the butt.I returned my unit (I had bought it from Costco). But if anyone has some suggestions on what I might have done better, that would be great.As an aside, do espresso machine manufacturers feel it necessary to make their instructions as difficult to follow as those from Ikea? I mean, really, folks: User experience is not brain surgery."
5,The Road to Riches,"The quintessential movie about the business for our generation, in which a good-hearted Kevin Bacon wins his film school's student competition, momentarily thrusting him into the spotlight, as well as the sights of Hollywood's bigwigs, and hence onto the road to artistic ruin. Superior writing, and exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Martin Short as Bacon's completely over-the-top agent, highlight this gem directed by Christopher Guest and featuring Michael McKean, both of Spinal Tap."
5,Gets better everytime I watch,"I just love this movie, but it may not be for all, since it is a very specific type of humor. Don't expect ""Best in Show"" or ""Waiting for Gufman,"" because this is not a mockumentary, but rather a really funny movie about the ups and downs in Hollywood. And may I add, very on point. I just love it more and more...and wish Guest would direct another one this funny.In love with both Emily Longstreth and Teri hatcher. I can't pcik which one, so I'll choose both!"
1,Isadora Rolls in Her Grave,"How Sad! The magic of the Dance is missing. (Like painting by numbers.) Where is the movement of the Soul? Modern Dance later removed the soul from the body and left us with bodies moved by brains, there is no place in Duncan for this! Have these dancers found their ""Motors?"" Do they listen to music with their souls? No wonder Duncan Dance is not taken seriously by most Dancers these days, they have never seen the real thing! Irma Duncan"
5,bl-6c,got as replacement battery for alesis videotrak works great as good as the original bought multiples so when battery dead just swap out for spare
5,Great reference for weird projects,"I know a little about Windows XP, but had a difficult time putting the tools together to do fun computer projects. This book was a tremendous help! If you have basic Windows XP knowledge but want a boost in your productivity, get this book!"
4,People say I'm no good...,"It never fails to amaze me when I'll put this cd on without telling anyone what it is. Without fail, everyone says they love it and asks who we're listening to. As soon as they find out, there's actually a physical recoil and they walk away confused. These are mellow countrified folk songs from a damned soul. Neil Young and the Beach Boys were fans (its documented). Never learn not to love..."
4,Along Came A Choo-Choo And Knocked My Monkey Cuckoo...,"Not too bad, definatley worth a listen. sound quality is a little shotty on some songs, but hey it's a demo. Overall it's a very interesting listen kind of Bob Dylan-esque, basically 60's folk music, his lyrics are quite interesting though, you just have to be able to look past who he is and what he did to enjoy this. And hell, it was good enough for G 'N' R to cover one song, and for Marilyn Manson to steal the lyrics from Mechanical Man and turn it itno ""My Monkey""."
2,Listen to the man who undresses death with his eyes.,"This CD Appeals to the fifth column in your mind and produces a palpably unfocused anxiety. An impasto of fetal jellies straight from the nethermind, yet stunningly orthodox & pedestrian."
3,WOW,"If you see this CD for under $5, get it...you won't regret it. I just can't seem to get enough of the cheesy narrator and the unbelievably corny dialogue...and to think that this was Bela Lagosi's farewell performance...oh well..."
2,Pass ...,"I won't suggest that my feet are easy to fit ... life had dictated a few necessary surgeries ... but that said, these were the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE shoes I have put on in ages...I've been looking for a slip-on shoe I can use around the house, y'know, slide it on and take the dogs for a walk and such. In my normal size, 11 EE, these just wouldn't work. The wide ... wasn't. Felt like my feet were in a vise. And the length, well, you'd probably want to go up a half-size just for length. So I did. I also went to a 4E extra wide.Gun boats. in a 11 4E the length was .. nearly okay. Still a bit short (honestly didn't seem any longer than the 11). The width was fine ... in the middle of the shoe. But somewhere along the line they brought in the toe-box, so in the 11 the toes were now crammed in.So I ended up paying return shipping twice, and no shoes. Very disappointing experience, and I won't likely give Merrell another chance.The shoes DID look nice, though. Pity."
5,new shoe review,I replaced a pair of merrel's jungle mocs which were 2 yrs old. they were still my most comfortable shoe but getting run over. paid $100. for them at bass pro so when I saw these at this great price I had to have them. great shoe and great price
2,Too Large!,"We ordered the exact same size as the ones my husband has now and they are much too big. Sent them back for a refund. However, Merrell's are excellent shoes."
4,Good Shoe,I use for my house shoes and good fit and feel. Could be a little less money though. But I like them.
5,Comfortable feet,"Merrell shoes are typically comfortable, with a polished fit and finish. The Jungle Mocs are no exception. I'd like just a hair more arch support and a somewhat softer sole, though I realize the latter is a tradeoff with longevity. In general, though, these are a wonderfully comfortable shoe for the workplace. I've also found them to be great for travel, since they can be removed easily and quickly for TSA inspection, then put back on without needing to bend down. These are essentially moccasins with a more typical shoe sole. Good job, Merrell."
5,"Wonderful, COMFORTABLE Shoes, Guys!","I have terribly bad feet, ankles, and legs, and a severely deteriorated spine at L4-L5. I also use a cane at all times.These shoes, from Merrell, are just the best thing since sliced bread!!Supportive, Solidly Constructed from Quality Materials, Rubber Soles (yea!) that stay soft and ""grippy"", not like the ""plastic stuff"" used by others!! Never Slip, Always Grip, even when wet and on tile floors.They fit and have a comfort level of slippers! How Great is That!? Softly, yet firmly, gripping your foot...you must try a pair and see what I mean! Don't doubt my word, men, read the other reviews here, also!Do yourself a GREAT favor, and get yourself a pair of these great, comfortable, and long-wearing shoes. I can tell you personally that the ""classic taupe"" and ""midnight"" always look well, and go with everything, and ""brush up"" wonderfully when soiled or skuffed looking!!Enjoy, and wear 'em in great comfort! ~operabruin"
5,great shoes,"I love these shoes. I now have a brown and a black pair. They run a little thin, wide fits me better. They look great, with good traction, easy to slip on , very supportive and comfortable."
5,My Magic Merrell Mocs,"A long time fan of Merrels men's shoes, I first purchased this model in Canada on a recent trip.I have worn them constantly for the past 12 months and needed replacements. No time to go back to Canadadespite the current buying power of the Australian dollar.Buying replacements through Amazon has proved very straightforward and I would not hesitate to do it again.These shoes (as with other Merrells) provide perfect support for my high arched foot which makes me prone to plantar fasciitis and I can work, walk and cycle in them without difficulty.Highly recommended."
1,Problem with elastic -- black version,"Before you decide based on my 1-star not to buy these, my review is based on the pair I received. I have had two other of these, but in brown/light brown. Both are very comfortable and I've worn them in the snow. My feet were warm and I didn't slide. (They're probably not designed for snow, though).With these black units, my heals kept coming out. Took me a while to figure out why. The elastic on the top wasn't strong enough -- not like my other colors. I called Merrill, and they sent me new inserts and I wore thicker socks. Same thing. I just sent them to Merrill for inspection. Based upon the new ones they send me, I may change this review."
5,Great comfortable shoe,My husband loves these shoes. This is his second pair and he wears them most of the time. He has a wide foot and has trouble finding comfortable shoes. These are very comfortable and wear quite well.
5,Best Moc out there.,"I have owned Moc's from several different manufacturers. The Merrell are by far the best: quality, comfort, design. You get what you pay for. One of the seller's: metroshoewharehouse was not that easy to deal with."
5,good feel and very comfortable,I dont rate alot of products but amazon just has away of being competitive and great products like this onethanks again and great suede too
4,Swingin' Mr. Shaw,"Several years ago, a five-LP record set was issued, which included a cross-section of the Artie Shaw's work. It included several broadcst recordings taken from air checks following the band's emergence, and it's first big hit: ""Begin the Beguine"". Also, included was some of Shaw's forties band, with Strings and his Gramercy Five small group work. It was a fabulous product. ""The Artie Shaw Story"" set certainly rivals the earlier five lp edition. Shaw was a master of the Clarinet, rivaled only by Benny Goodman. Shaw's early band, included Buddy Rich who came to Shaw following the disbanding of Bunny Berigan's full Orchestra, was a really hot swinging band, with lots of drive and was able to as Shaw himself said, ""..play with a lot of conviction..."". The Artie Shaw story is highly recommended for any one who, as the writer, loves big-band jazz, and particularly fans of the late Artie Shaw."
5,dvds,I was very satisfied with the dvd quality. I already burned 10 dvds and all are great quality. Plus geting 100 dvd pack for around 35 dollars was a huge deal. Thanks.
5,Used abt 60 till now - no failures,Verbatim is great. not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs. I use Nero to perfectly complement the burning process. I was sceptic when i did geta great deal (~25 AR). heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line.Excellent discs would definitely go for em. was always a believer in Ritek Ridata before these. got to get some of those RWs..
5,High Quality DVD's,"High quality discs made by mitsubishi. They are rated at 8X, but label says they can record up to 12x if the drive supports it."
1,This is a piece of crap just dont buy it.,They turned out to be toasters. Like out of 10 only 3 were good. I would recommend Philips. I boutght a 100 pack and only 1 was the coaster :(Pretty good.
3,"Verbatim: once the best, now roulette of mnufacturers","Verbatim was for a long time the last bastion that of quality brand that made its own disks, via their holding company Mitshibishi (MCC). The last verabatim 8x +r's I got ended up as CMC, a much lower quality manufacturer. too bad."
5,THESE ARE EXCELLENT DVD BLANKS.VERY GOOD QUALITY,"I FIND THE VERBATIM MEDIA BLANKS TO BE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.THEY ARE COMPATIBLE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPUTER BURNERS,AND HOME DVD RECORDERS,THAT USE THESE BLANKS.WHEN YOU BURN YOUR HOME MOVIES OR DATA FILES,THEY ARE THERE TO STAY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,AND INEXPENSIVE."
4,Great video; extremely poor sound,"I don't know if it's a production glitch (as in a DVD production defect), but the sound levels in this in DVD fluctuate so much as to be completely distracting and (at times) flat-out annoying. Sometimes the sound of the overall mix rises and falls, while in other places one particular instrument comes across really in-your-face in the overall mix.That said, the video quality is good. It is well-shot, and the performance itself is... well, Yes! They've never disappointed me in a performance. The sound thing should have been fixed when they mastered the thing though... that bugs me."
1,Don't buy this DVD,"I'm sorry to report that this DVD is just plain awful. The sound is bad and the gig is boring, it's as if Yes had a disease; this is fairly painful to watch. Don't buy this one if you want to keep a good memory of this band which was once great. I wanted to cry, seriously. You don't want to know how bad this performance is, trust me."
5,Funniest Movie I have ever seen.,"I saw this movie when it was released in 1960. Tony Hancock was fantastic as a no-talent painter. The dialogue was hilarious and the sight gags superclever. Tony Hancock was a gifted performer who was part of the ""Goon Show"" team that included Peter Sellers. This was the only movie that I am aware of him being cast. I watched it again on TV in 1964 and have been looking for it world-wide since.I would think somewone with two working brain cells would have put this on DVD by now. And yet, we cannot even find it on VHS."
4,gOOd,The product and the receiving was in time and Was good...Unfortunately the box has been broken during the package travelling... :-s
2,fan review,I ordered two of these fans and have had good luck in the past.However altho there was no physicaql damge to the appearance of the unit the fans hit the housing continuously
5,Blower,I'm a photographer and this unit will work well as an inexpensive wind machine.Unit is well built and a good price. Pushes plenty of air volume.
3,IT works but not like some reviews say,"This fan did keep me cool but some of these reviews exaggerate. I has the impression from some reviews that this fan would keep my entire room cool but it really didnt. This past summer I was in a dorm with no AC and the fan helped at night alot, it didnt cool off the entire room. I pointed the fan towards my head and I was good. But some reviews say it keeps you very cold which isnt that true. It is very powerful though, and somewhat loud but when your hot you dont care about the noise. The noise really isnt annoying either."
5,high velocity isnt the word....,this thing kicks out air like no other fan i have owned. I am very please with it because i know someone who has one and its left on 24/7. yes its that good. no worries but only taking it apart and cleaning it there are 3 screws holding it together on the right side of it the feet pull off so u can get to the screws easily. and there is a bolt u have to losen to get the blower wheel off. and the rating for the plugs are enough to run an air compressor so it is a great fan when working in the garage. i do recommend buying this fan for anyone.
5,Great for White Noise,"We've had this fan for years for various uses (painting, drying out rooms, etc) and now it has a home in my daughter's room. She's 2 and for over a year we've used it as white noise while she's sleeping. Pointed at the floor on the highest setting drowns out any background, house sounds (phone ringing, dog barking, doorbell). She sleeps well with it every night!"
4,Good product,"Have had one of these fans for 8 years now. Still works fine, I use it all summer long to air out my apartment, this is a quality squirrel cage fan."
4,greeting card organizer,I have been using 2 of these for the past year. I purchase cards in advance and keep certain types on hand. It is easy to use and so convenient. I love it. CPC
2,Not what I expected,Wow I did not have any idea how cheap this product was; maybe I didn't read well enough. It is made of flimsy plastic that you have to lock together with small tabs - however put too much in the box and the bottom will fall out and you will have all your cards on the ground. I speak from experience and I only have around 15 or so cards in it. This will work until I get a real box for the same reason.
4,i'm not even a cat lover,and I was enchanted by the adventures of Marcello. The photography was amazing... obviously the filmmaker understands how to direct the feline stars. I've never seen that before with live cats. Definitely a stocking stuffer!
4,Pretty good,"I personally didn't enjoy the movie that much. I will say this though - my son and my niece(4 and 6 years) really enjoyed it. They are both cat lovers, having grown up in a household where the only pets are cats.We didn't buy the movie, but we may, if the kids ask for it a lot. I just didn't like it enough to buy it for my own enjoyment."
4,Pretty good overall,"Works pretty well and seems well made. The blade is about 2-3"" wider than some other squeegees we've had, which is nice, since it covers a wider area with each pass. The suction cup holds well to the shower wall and holds the handle nicely. My only negative is that the blade is more firm than others that we've had, so it feels a little more clunky to use. Of course, the upside of that may be that the blade will last longer, so we'll see after a few more months. (We've used it for about a month now.) Seems well worth the price so far."
5,Gimme a little squeegee !,"Like most Oxo Good Grips products, this squeegee is reasonably priced and performes well.It is meant for showers, so it is not as wide as your typical window squeegee. However, this size is excellent for cleaning shower glass, and its size is perfect to get in between handles and hinge plates, etc.The blade is about 10"" wide (9 and 15/16 if you want to be technical). The handle is about 4 1/2"" long, and overall, the squeegee is just under 6"" from the head of the blade to the tip of the handle.The blade is clear, as is the included suction cup. The body of the squeegee is white and the handle is black.This item will perform the same as the Oxo Good grips stainless steel squeegee, which costs almost twice as much, although that product gives you the look of stainless steel, albeit with a black blade.For functionality, price, and a clean look, this squeegee cannot be beat."
2,Failing grade,"I really wanted to like this, but it just didn't work well. The silicone is not soft enough to leave a streak free ""swipe"". I went back to using the previous squeegee that had black rubber on the business end. It gets 2 stars because it is better than most silicone squeegees, but not nearly as good as rubber."
4,Works Great,"This sqeegee works great, love that it can hang in the shower... It's narrow enough to between shower doors.. Very happy with my purchase!"
4,"Good, but suction cup is short-lived","Nice squeegee. The suction cup held well to the shower wall for a few months, but now seems to have curled a bit and won't hold. Squeegee is still good, so wish they'd coupled it with a more durable suction cup."
3,"Works well, but kind of small.","Fits well in hand. Clears water well, but it is very small for the price. Has a suction cup that really only works on glass."
3,not great,I like to keep my shower and mirrors clean but this doesn't work very well for the task. Every other squeege I've owned works better. So...meh.
4,not for the impressionable or idiotic,"this stuff is pretty effed up indeed,but from a historical point of view you can't deny that allin did something nobody else dared to do with music:make it his kind of sickness.he proved that to be the ""most punk"", talent and lyrical content were secondary to persona.from what i have always understood punk was always about doing something different and new,as well as something most people wouldn't understand.gg injected punk rock with a renewed brashness and perversity that had steeped from that scene when he came on board.with that said,i only have this album and hated in the nation,have only listened to each 5 times or less,but can still see a significance to his art.some art may not be ethically sound and morally decent,but blind ignorance ALWAYS clouds the possibility to understand art and it's infinate potential."
4,"Great Story, Great Art","This is an excellent book with excellent art, and a super story, like a CSI episode and X-files but better `cause of the werewolves (taekwondo, lots of mauled corpses, forensics and 44. magnums make this feel like Scully and Mulder find Grissom and kick it with a Dirty harry on zen). The research the author does for this is also pretty spectacular with the laws and monuments and construction materials for elements in the comic. This is definitely worth a read(or six)."
3,Good beginning goes flat,"The thought of this kind of romance intrigued me, so I bought the book. Little did I know that it started out srtong but would fizzle into nothing. The beginning was good but the middle and ending were plain boring. The laird is nice. The lady is a shrew throughout most the book. I mean, give the guy a break already. I would rather check this book out of the library than pay the 5 or 6 bucks for it"
4,Nice Pack,"This is the same package that I used for my first guitar, and it's pretty reliable, with a good pedal and an amp it can actually perform very well. Beware however, that you don't leave the guitar sitting (on a chair or something) with the cord still in! I just had the plate around the jack crack. Nothing serious, but a big annoyance.Overall a very good product."
5,helpful textbook,This is focused on The application of Si in optical devices. I think that this book is very interesting and helpful to graduate students or any people who want to know how important Si is in the optoelectronics.
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!,"okay it looks cool but it is slow and the controler breaks everytime i use it. the secound time i used it, when i was doing a drag race and it all the suden spined out and it blew up into tiny peices when i didn't even use the turbo. IT is worth nothing more than 1 cent and it does not come with a battery they are lieing"
3,Good Performance - Poor Construction,"This bluetooth headset provides good performance, as good as any other I have used, and with great listening volume. However, the construction is poor - I have had to send it in for replacement under warranty twice already - the cover over the earpiece falls off. Cardo customer support is great and the replacement was fairly quick."
2,Treo 650 Reception,"Purchased the Cardo Scala expecting great things based on what others have written. The cost is not bad ($34) and it paired fine. Also, the battery life is good. The functionality is terrible. Bad static unless phone is right next to headset. If you wear phone on your left side and use headset on your right ear, this bluetooth is not for you. Also, the volume is very low. If you are outside, good luck hearing the person you are speaking with. I imagine in a library you would be fine though. I have gone back to my plug in headset and the fancy cardo scala is now sitting in my desk drawer."
2,Very Poor Reception,"I have used this for Vonage phone calls on my computer - I would speculate my computer has more bluetooth power/range than the other devices - but the scala-500 begins to break up as near as 8 feet away.I used it with my Sony Ericsson T610 phone - works well. But again, only around 5-8 feet of range.Used it with a new Samsung T809. TERRIBLE. Static every time it tries to connect. Poor reception while the phone is being held inches away from the scala-500. Even walking around with the phone in my pocket, the scala-500 looses connection altogether. I suspect it's more the Samsung's fault.Im returning this and trying a Tekkeon headset."
3,Good Sound but Flimsy Build,"3 Days after receiving the headphone I pulled it off my ear on the way to work. The speaker for the headphone detached from what was a minor tug. The sound is pretty good for a wireless headphone, it is easy to use, but too bad it is built so flimsy. I did receive good service from the manufacturer however, and I was able to get the unit replaced pretty easily."
3,It's Just OK,"This is my 3rd bluetooth earpiece and what I have learned is that most earpieces are made for a man's ear. My ears are on the small side and I have yet to find an earpiece that will stay on. This one isn' bad as far as ease of use,easy to charge, sound quality and size. It has a nifty cord to keep it from going astray when you're not using it. It also comes with a holster (another guy-thing I guess) but mine broke the first time I tried to use it and after emailing the seller I got no response as to what to do.With all that said--it's a decent product, it just didn't work well for me. I'm still looking..."
4,headset,"Lasts me all day on a single charge !!!. This also has the ability to use a car charger if needed. I haven't noticed that feature on other headsets. Not as wind resistant as I had hoped for but still an amazing little headset. Very light weight and gets a little uncomfortable by the third full day of constant use. I wear it all day long (9am-4pm) and talk as long. Great item, great price definetely would recommend for everyone who talks alot."
4,Good but not Fantastic,"The Cardo Systems scala-500 Bluetooth Headset is definitely a great investment. The ease of operation and functionality are very good. The system is very clear and has plenty of volume. The battery life is also commendable. Over all I am happy with my purchase. Don't be mislead by the noise canceling feature, its pretty good but definitely not as good as the ""hype"". You can not use it with your window down much less if you have a convertible. I have found that you can't really have the radio on at all. The 30 foot range is standard for the industry but it will sure be nice when the newer models come out with improved distance."
3,Active in Indy,I am a female traffic control officer the ear piece is not made for small people or small ears. You have to bend it to fit the ear so it don`t fall off. If you are active and the belt clip fits the belt loops good but you have to be careful to not hit it or the ear piece falls to the ground. And the neck strap that comes with it is not the one you see online. as for the lasting time of the charge it holds and the talk time is great. I talk alot on the phone I charge it every two days.Over all it is a good ear piece to have if you are not all that active.
5,Blu-tooth,"This is by far the best headset that I've ever owned. The talk time is outstanding and the fit is exceptional. I've had several other bluetooth earpieces but none are comparable to the Scala 500. I highly reccommend this product, you won't be dissapointed."
3,Static when phone is in my purse,Works great except when my phone is in my purse or more than a foot away. That's my only complaint.
2,Just adequate,I bought this after reading a number of good reviews. This is a replacement for a Jabra bt-201 which was lost.Pros:The large call control button is nice.Bluetooth setup was straightforward.The bluetooth connection with my Ipaq 6315 is clean (the Jabra suffered from static at times).Cons:Volume control is awkward.The ear clip seems more awkward and is less comfortable than the Jabra.The earpiece speaker is adequate but the sound seems tinny and harsh. Doesn't fit my ear all that well.The mic volume is low -- people sometimes have difficulty hearing me.Plastic shroud around the earpiece speaker broke off after only a week. Glued back on and speaker still works fine.Summary: I'm still using it but would not buy another.
4,It is a ok product for the price,Works great with both my Blackberry and Palm Treo 650. Definitely recommend it. As good as Motorola for a lesser price! I would have given a 5 star but the newer model of scala is better than this one for just a little extra price.
4,"Excellent item, possibly brittle?","I am extrememly pleased with this item. It's very comfortable, convenient to use, and holds a charge for hours and hours.My only issue is that this is a replacement unit--my previous one stopped working unexpectedly. Of course, I left it in my car during the summer, so it may be my fault."
1,this is a pirated copy of the movie,when ordering this i thought i was getting a orginal copy of the movie. To my suprise when i get it in the mail. The dvd Cover art looks like it was copyed at kinkos. And after puting the disc in it ask if i like to play track 1 or track 2. Which i what a pirated copy of a dvd or cd says. So to all other buyer beware. And to amazon you need to look at this product and see for yourself. What you are selling.
2,You gotta be into this kinda stuff,"you really gotta be into this kind of stuff to enjoy it, otherwise you won't. its a typical 50s low budget sci-fi movie, like the other reviewers have said. I gave it a 2 from my personal opinion that there are hundreds of movies like this and it has nothing that really makes it unique, however if you like this stuff then go ahead and watch it, otherwise, don't waste your time, there are hundreds like this."
3,"Giant crabs eat brains, speak with victims' voices","Typical terrible early low-budget sci-fi. Standard '50's cliches abound -- female lab assistant falls in path of oncoming monsters and shrieks until rescued by swell male scientist, etc. Beautifully hokey -- loved it as a kid!"
3,Valley Hitch,The hitch appeared to be made well. When I tried to install the hitch the bolt holes wouldn't line up. It looked like the hitch had warped when it was welded. I returned the hitch for a refund. Amazon was great as usual and refunded my money with no hassles.
4,good read,"Channeled messages form Archangel Zadkiel on 2012 , ascension and how to prepare for it . The other books in the series are also good ."
3,"Primer disco 100% Hollies, pero lo mejor está por venir","Para algunos éste es el mejor trabajo de los Hollies. No realmente. Es cierto que por primera vez está compuesto enteramente por ellos y es un verdadero crecimiento en cuanto a su posición como creadores de álbumes (algo que Stones, Kinks y otros ya estaban haciendo), pero no es más que bueno.Stop stop stop fue un gran éxito y aún hoy es un tema lleno de energía con su maniático banjo; Pay your back with interest es también uno de los puntos altos pero sin duda lo mejor aquí es la fantástica Tell me to my face con sus aires de bossa nova, una joya inexplicablemente desconocida dentro del catálogo del grupo. Hay otros momentos interesantes y si bien no hay canciones desechables 3 de 12 no es suficiente para transformarlo en un clásico."
2,"computer illustration,computer graphics,How to use computers for graphics",Not a very good book on how to use computers for illustration and design. There are so many books on the subject that are far more in depth and written by people who are at the top of their field-this is not one of them.
1,Half of order missing,"I was very disappointed when I received my order because it was supposed to be a 3 set DVD Beginners, intermediate, and advanced; well I only received the intermediate DVD. It would be nice if I could get the beginners to start with and also the advanced. The order did arrive in a timely manner, so that was good. This is the first time this happened so it could have been a honest mistake."
5,Best Motorcycle Sim out there,"the folks behind Gran Tourismo really got the motorcycle genre right in this one. It's a challenging trip through lots of modern and a few classic bikes from all the major japanese manufacturers and a few european ones. some fairly significant models seem to be missing, but there are some fascinating choices for what they did include. great graphics, great play engine, good 2-player mode, lots of good tracks."
5,Great Riding Game,"I have not ridden many motorcycles, but with my limited experience, I can say that this game will get you a great feel for how street and sports bikes perform. This is a great game, with a simple, well designed interface. The only thing I want to see in it yet is Road America, but that's minor."
2,Tilt A Whirl In a Can,"I have at least four different motorcycle games, dirt bike and road race. This has to be the worst physics of any of them bar none. If you slow down and lean too much, its as if the world keeps moving and you can somehow slide sideways even when you should be traveling forward. Very disconcering. I played this game for about an hour and just couldn't believe my eyes. VERY touchy controls with the standard PS2 controller. The bikes were cool, and there seemed to be alot of choices, even some old vintage bikes. If I had it to do over again after seeing this game in action, I would have gotten something else."
2,Short-stemmed Microphone Is Frustrating to Use,"I am disappointed in this product's performance because I cannot easily use the microphone to modulate my speaking voice. While the microphone's stem is flexible, it is too short to be positioned optimally. As a result, the microphone remains somewhere to the left of my speaking voice. Some callers have told me that my voice seems ""far away."" When I bend the stem to get closer to the microphone, the arm is long enough to catch one side of my mouth but too short to be positioned an inch or so directly in front of me. I often resort to switching from the headset to the handheld telephone midway through a conversation."
5,it works great,put the cd in and follow the instructions someone put in the the reviews. it works great i have no problems using it
2,Broke after 8 months,"I bought this item March 2009 for $[...] , by the end of the year, it had stopped working. The USB no longer powered on the device, and it wasn't fixable. I looked online to buy a new one and saw that Microsoft discontinued the device altogether. Another faulty device by Microsoft's crap hardware factory. I bought the xbox360, and 6 months later it broke down too (they wouldn't replace it, even though it was under warranty).If you do buy this thing, one thing to note is that you cannot turn off your wireless controllers any other way but pulling out their battery packs. It's really incredible how bad the design is for this thing.My advice is to steer clear or buy the wired controller if you must. I have 2 wireless xb360 controllers collecting dust now. I'm never buying Microsoft hardware again."
4,"Works as intended, works with steam, no issues, decently long cord.","Works as intended.Didn't try the driver on the disk, just went to Microsoft page and found the driver, installed, works.Mainly using it for steam and steam related games."
5,Awsome,i ordered on the 2/16/12came 2/23/12 fast shipping and excellent service thought i was going to have to return but the found this site [...] fixed all my problems so it works great now i can play my custom zombies like a boss
1,This is not Official Microsoft Product,Beware this is not an official Microsoft product. However if you want to do some work. It will be about a 5-15 minute process to find the correct drivers and make this work on your computer. The CD is not compatible with Windows 7 btw.
1,after all the driver headaches it still wont stay synced,"Don't waste your time and money. I got it working with the instructions found here, but it just won't stay synced. And yes, it's getting plenty of juice from the USB ports. This is pathetic. It should not be this hard. Just show me the official Microsoft Xbox receiver for a pc and I'll buy it. Or just give me a way the plug it in wired."
1,"Very simple, very convenient","I bought this so I could use an xbox 360 controller for racing games and other types on my gaming PC while not having to go out and buy a 3rd party controller. This did the trick, allows me to play just like an xbox, and even, at times is better to use, than a keyboard. Not sure what everyone is complaining about the drivers for, they're on the disc it comes with. Worked perfect for me, and I think if you are considering this then just get it. It's not that expensive, and it's so simple."
1,NOT A MICROSOFT PRODUCT,The title says it all. this product is not made by microsoft as advertised. I learned of this soon after buying it but it worked so I didnt really care. Then about a month later it stopped working. My PC doesnt even recognize it. I think the seller of this should give me my money back for falsely advertising the product as one from microsoft. But I doubt that will ever happen.
1,XBox 360 wireless receiver,"Product did not work as intended, or at all. Drivers would not install correctly and I could not find any that would work."
1,Buggy,"Item is an xbox look alike, randomly scrambles keybindings. Definitely useful when working properly, but overall junk not worth any money"
5,From Console to PC,"This helped me make the transition from console gaming to pc gaming. I can flawlessly connect wireless xbox 360 controllers to my pc. Even though the one that I got wasn't Microsoft branded, it works as it should."
1,Oh... Reviews?,Why would I bother to read reviews for a product I already know about?So people can warn me I'm buying some cheap Chinese knock-off and not the Microsoft product listed?Oh... I guess that would have been a good reason.Oh hai there Amazon A-Z!
2,Can't get it to work,"I have a windows 7 Home Premium Gateway Laptop.The drivers for this suck, when I can finally get it to work with GTA San Adreas or CoD MW2, only 2 of the buttons (A and B) work, but they don't do the right button function.Very disappointed, I should have bought the other version of this off amazon."
4,"Pain to install, but then works great - Win 7","I purchased this to use on my Windows 7 PC that is hooked up to my HDTV via HDMI. I thought it would be plug and play, but it was not. Also as other reviews have stated the CD that comes with the unit does not work, I believe the CD is only for Win XP users. After some searching I found the installation instructions on a forum. Here is how I got it to work...Right click on ComputerGo to PropertiesClick on Device ManagerRight click on the Unidentified DeviceGo to PropertiesGo to the Drive tabClick on Update Driver...Browse my computer for driver softwareLet me pick from a list of device drivers on my computerMicrosoft Common Controller for Window ClassXbox 360 Wireless Receiver for WindowsUpdate Driver WarningClick Yes"
2,Stay AWAY!,"This thing kills all my USB devices on my computer. If it is unplugged your devices still won't work & it will not sync until you restart your computer. Forums have suggested getting a powered usb hub to solve the issues, however in my case it has no effect. So if I want to use my USB Headset, Bluetooth Controller, USB Wireless Adapter, Webcam, etc, I am completely SOL! My advise is STAY AWAY from this product and if you want to use a 360 controller in windows... GET A WIRED ONE!"
5,darn good sci-fi,the creepiest season and terribly heartbreaking but if your a fan of classic sci-fi (both written or audio visual) then you will enjoy torchwood.
1,The Doctor would be revolted.,"This is awful! The acting is bad, the effects are bad, the plot is derivative. Worse than all that is that the whole story is way too dark and Captain Harkness spoils all that might follow with his actions. Oh, and this is one more flick that shows anyone with a laptop or two can save the world or destroy it."
1,Depraved,I can't believe how disappointing this mini-series is. The concept is totally depraved and shocking for the sake of shock. The screenwriter of this trash is just too jaded. He should retire.
3,Good beginning but ending was a let down.,"Watched it day by day as a mini-series on BBC. It held my interest and attention, but found the ending to be disappointing. There are also some story technical issues that slipped by them while filming, like the blood or alien goo on the glass, which disappears without explanation in later scenes. The chanting by the masses of children seemed overdone as well. It's a good story overall, kinda scarey about what governments might do in such a situation. 3 1/2 - 4."
2,Disappointing,"As a long-time fan of Torchwood, I found this series highly disappointing, in spite of some superb performances from the cast. While I am not opposed to character death-- including the deaths of my favourite characters-- I feel that it was poorly handled in this instance: a cheap trick that contributed nothing to the resolution of the storyline.I am disinclined to watch this again."
2,Unbelieveable,"I loved the Torchwood series - in typical fashion, just like Dr Who, it was a bit trashy, but great characters and just a good watch. I don't know who on earth wrote the script for this dross - Children of the Earth - but they should be sent off to their own galaxy. This could have been a great mini-series - with a good story line that unfortunately got lost in a mire of platitudes and just poor screen writing - especially in the last two episodes. What a shame."
5,Deliciously Dark and Stunning,"No spoilers for the plot!While there are many reasons why I want to hurt Russel T. Davies, Children of Earth is not one of them. The entire series was incredibly well-put together. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole thing. Yes, it is a lot darker than Torchwood has ever been before. No it's not the same Torchwood that we know and love. Something incredibly unexpected happened and the crew of Torchwood had to adjust. There's nothing far-fetched about that. I miss having all five of the team around, but I am eager to see what comes next. Don't think this is the end of Torchwood!"
1,this is not Torchwood,"I am new to the Torchwood series and have just recently watched all the episodes. The first two seasons were incredible--great cast, witty writing, just enough camp to be fun. I fell in love with the show, all the way up until they started killing off main characters in season 2. Now, when you have a cast that is perfect together, I don't see why you would kill any of them off. Think of what ""House"" would be if they just decided to have Cuddy and Wilson die. Season 3 is completely different from the other 2 seasons, mainly in tone. Season 3 is dark and the characters are nothing like you remember them from the past 2 seasons. It feels like someone wrote a dark sci-fi drama and then just shoe horned the characters and settings from Torchwood into it. I recommend watching the first 2 series (although don't watch series 2 through the end if you want to remember the cast all together) as the episodes are great. Season 3 is not for you if you like the first 2 seasons."
1,Would not recommend,"This miniseries is downbeat, depressing, and so full of massive plotholes that I would not recommend it. Very little thought seems to have gone toward the writing of this very un-Torchwood storyline, with characters killed off as nothing but a plot device for dramatic effect. The only saving grace in this depressing mess are the phenomenal acting performances given by Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto and John Barrowman as Captain Jack. Save your money and buy seasons one and two instead."
5,there's nothing like it!,"this is really great stuff! I have very frizzy, curly hair - and this says it's a straightening balm - but it actually just calms the curls and gives the hair a nice normal sheen (makes it soft looking). I've used it for years!"
1,Bad experience,"This is my mom's favorite perfume. It was my gift for her Birthday. The fragrance is totally different, and it smells horrible!!!"
2,"love, lies, and murder","To my memory the movie was not an accurate portrayal. But then again I was only 17 years old. I played video games with David and his brother in law and Cinnamon when she was just a kid. Linda was pregnant the last time I saw them at Garden Square Bowl. I have been looking for this movie since it came on T.V. I'm glad I found it, but from what I remember, it was different in real life."
4,Honorable effort,"I would not call it a grammar, or a study guide, but a rich compilation of Aramaic sentences and references. However, to the beginners, -An Introduction to Aramaic- is a sort of grammar.The author most be recognized for this honorable effort.The transliteration is well noticed.Linguistically, it is refreshing.The public will now realize and understand the differences and similarities between the Hebrew and the Aramaic.This is an important tool for learning and teaching as well."
3,Older Recipes,"This book was written in 2005, and although the author writes well, the recipes are dated and suited more towards desktop users."
5,great product,the book came on time and it was like new. would definitely use this vendor again. used it right away
3,Some glitches...,"Overall I'm satisfied. However, sometimes the game will not start and on the menu screen, you cannot access anything besides the game itself. Other than that, it is fine."
5,"finally, a cover album full of songs worth covering!!!","all i can say is amazing. these guys epitomize everything that is real and honest w/ music in the 21st century. i knew i was going to give this album 5 stars after hearing their exact and flawless execution of the first 2 1/2 minutes of blackened. i will be honest, i am from their generation. all of these songs strike a chord to me just as they do these guys. there is no disputing the musicianship and quality of this recording. tell me any new band out there who can stand up to these ""new"" masters of metal. i think showing their sensibilities on this album is only going to make the anticipation for the new album greater. long live btbam, and may they forever reign. peace out"
4,Fun Idea- Watch out for interference,"I had some problems getting the RC car to work but in the end it turned out it was interference from our baby monitor. When I had problems, the company was great about helping out and making sure I was satisfied- it was finally their idea to try turning off anything that might interfere.Very satisfied with this toy- great idea too!"
3,Christmas gift.,My Grandson loves it. You have to stay close to it in order for the remote control to work. Best if you have wood floors.
4,book review,"this book is a precursor to ""Web of Evil"". I liked the ""blogging"" concept within the book, thought it kept the story line going and showed the author's creativity."
2,"Jance Lite - Less interesting, with a hint of cloying and annoying","I am a huge fan of Jance's work, so I was surprised that I didn't like Edge of Evil very much. Jance is so good at creating characters with interesting dark sides. The characters in this book seem much better suited for an episode of Extreme Makeover Home Edition. I hope Jance will not develop the Ali Reynolds character any further. She has such a goldmine with J.P. Beaumont and Joanna Brady."
5,Edge of Evil,It was a great book. A friend gave me the rest of the series but it was missing the first book of the series.
1,SUPERIOR AIR CLEANER-- PREFILTER--REALLY?,I RECIEVED THIS PRE-FILTER IN THE MAIL-- I LOVE MY HEALTHMATE AIR CLEANER-- BUT THIS PRE-FILTER APPEARS TO BE A CHEAP PIECE OF C---! LOOKS AS IF IT COSTS THEM ALL OF 2 BUCKS TO MANUFACTURE. I HAVE NOT EVEN TRIED TO CHANGE IT YET FOR FEAR THAT IT IS SO FLIMSY THAT IT WILL NOT FIT UP AGAINST THE CLEANER PROPERLY. FOR AN AIR CLEANER THAT COST JUST SOUTH OF $500.00 THIS IS REDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!! I AM UNIMPRESSED!!!!! . AS FAR AS AMAZON IS CONCERNED-- YOU GUYS AND GALS ARE GREAT--- QUICK DELIVERY TIME AS USUAL. BY THE WAY-- THE IMAGES OF THE 2 PRE-FILTERS SHOWN THE PICTURE IN NO WAY DEPICT WHAT I ACTUALLY RECEIVED.
2,MPX220,"The phone volume was low, regardless of the firmware version. Using a BlueTooth headset made it a lot more useable, but this phone isn't good enough in other respects to justiy that requirement. Data entry sucks. Most web browsing renders sites too small to be really useful. The Outlook integration is terrific, but without fast entry, sending email or typing documents is tedious. With shiesty audio volume, the PDA aspects of the phone seem even worse."
3,"Good look, performance lacks","The phone is great looking and everything you could ask from a phone aesthetically. However, it does not perform as well as a lot of cheaper phones. The battery shuts down randomly, the screen often freezes, and many times, after a call ends it stalls for a good 5-10 seconds. Although the phone has many capabilities, it is not as high quality as it seems. The camera lags as well. I dont think it is worth the price as of now, but if the price drops, and you're looking for a good looking phone with decent capabilities, this phone isnt that bad of a choice."
1,wrong pictures-different in person,"I will be honest with you all customers. i purchase this earrings directly from this company but when it arrived, the design of three circle was just all same sized circle, and was not like in the pictures. so disappointing. you should be careful before you order it if you really are looking for exactly same design earrings like in the pictures. also this company were really so late response all the time and so late for the refund too. so disappointing. i have no confident in this company and would never purchase again from this seller."
2,"Cute, but not puddle proof","These boots are very cute, but did not hold up to their first puddle test. I ended up with wet toes. Also run big."
5,Bollywoods Best Music From Its Landmark Film,"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is quite possibly the most popular film to ever come out of Bollywood and the singing and dancing is unquestionably the best I've ever seen in any film. If you love this movie as I do you simply must own the soundtrack. The music is outstanding, capturing all the pagentry and emotion of the film. You will be bouncing and gyrating around the house whether you understand Hindi or not. The passion and beauty of this music is truly universal.Warning: Don't let the neighbors see you when you start getting into 'Shava Shava.' They will think you've finally lost it!"
4,E.P. PROJECT,The group definately has potential and has a very good sound. It's sounds better than alot of music I've heard on the interenet. Do they have any other music coming out? and When?
5,WELL ROUNDED - THE ONLY BOOK YOU'LL NEED - DIA DUIT!,"Interesting trivia: The Irish marry the Polish and the Polish marry the Irish more than any other cultures, outside of their own that is.The Polish Trivia BookandPolish TriviaandIrish TriviaEvery Irish or Polish wedding I've been to has been wonderful!Dia Duit and Jane Kooyeh!"
3,it lasted 1 hour,"popeye, my english bulldog, is a powerful chewer. his okra jack had lasted for over 6 months, so i eagerly ordered the stick. it arrived today and he went to town on it before i could cut it from the cardboard. he pulled and tugged at the rope so much that it wore him out and he took a quick siesta, but lord help the stick when he woke up with his second wind. he couldn't the rope out because of the knot at the other end, so he did the next best thing...attack the rubber. i saw the first blue chunk in an hour and 4 more chunks 15 minutes later. maybe it wouldve lasted longer if i'd played fetch, but he was so content trying to pull the rope out, i figured that would be the first to go and i didn't care about the rope because i could always re-knot it or fill the stick with peanut butter once the rope was gone. oh well, at least he still has his okra jack and he still has the rest of the stick to tear up before i toss it."
1,Hate to Be the Only Nay Sayer,"I will give any book 50 pages. If it hasn't grabbed me by the 50th page, I put it down. I have too many books in my to-be-read pile to waste my time on a book that isn't written well, is poorly plotted, or badly edited.Unfortunately, this book is all three of the prime time wasters listed above. I did read the 50 pages, but could not go beyond that.If you want to read a well-written, well-plotted book with interesting characters and even a mystery thrown in, try Charles Todd, Laurie R. King, or Peter Robinson. These are hard-to-put down books unlike reading Piercy's book wishing you were doing any thing else (including housework or cleaning out the garage)."
2,Disappointed,"As an amateur photographer I was extremely disappointed in this book. I realize that of course the pictures were focusing on subject matter, lighting, motion etc..but none of the photos touched me.The reason I purchased the book was because of all the rave reviews, and I can't help but wonder if the reviews were for Lindas' actual work or because she died so young and/or worse yet because she was married to a ""BEATLE"". In my opinion this book seems no better than a collection of pictures I have. What I don't have is a famous husband to get the book printed."
4,simple effective storyline,Bombs planted in the San Andreas fault. Only one man can prevent a new western coastline from forming.
1,dont,"I could write a better book about marrying cops and it wouldn't even make it past the Min. character limit on Amazon. it would simply be one word. ""Don't."""
4,Good Resource,"If you are interested in Indiana history, particularly african-american history, Emma Lou Thornbrough is an outstanding author and researcher. This book has been educational"
5,Wolo Back Up Talking Alarm,Product was easy to install and very reasonably priced. Works great especially in parking lots...really gets pedestrian's attention yet is not obnoxious so it's appreciated by them. I did put a switch at the instrument panel to turn it off when I wish.
3,Silly but fun learning,"This book is just fantastic! It is the best way to learn new words. It tells you a story , and then, it tells you the definition! Trust me you'll laugh so hard that you'll probably cry."
2,Can't stand up to minor abuse,This is a pretty set of cookware but if you have kids stick to something more durable like Revereware. My twelve year old left one of these pans on the stove on med. heat (with nothing in it) for about 5 min. The entire pan fell apart. I personally would not purchase this cookware again.
4,Children learning bible stories,"My Children are young adults and teenages and they love the superbook stories they found them an exciting way to learn the bible for them the stories came alive, now my son wants his son to have the same experience he did from them."
2,It was a disappointment,"Although encouraging to new grant writers, too much of the book is reprinted information from other sources (web etc.). If I had paid $30.00 for the book and disk (with templates also downloadable from the web) I would have been more satisfied. However, it is not worth the high price."
2,A real disapointment,"Do not buy this DVD if you really love Bob Marley. There is no ""magic"" in it.It is a regular video for a regular party that is so boring to watch and without much music to listen."
4,Nutri-West-Core Level Health Reserve,"It is a great product, however, I will shop around for something like it because the price is simply too high."
1,Like reading yesterday' menu,"This book is a collection reprinted articles from various magazines from 1956 to 1988. They appear with the original b&w illustrations and photos from the magazines. Most of them are reviews and road tests. They are arranged by date, and that is the only organization. The articles themselves are just what you would expect- basic promos for the vehicles. BUT THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW! The great things and the bad things about Toyota Land Cruisers have been born out by time, and that is impossible to find out by going into a time warp to 1969! I would really like to see a book about Land Cruisers like the SA Design series on performance build-ups of Jeeps. At least with something useful for today's Land Cruiser owner. Or a book with some really nice color pictures of the Land Cruiser series. This book was neither."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Sorry, folks. This album totally sucks. Gone is the mystique that characterized such great albums as ""Imaginos,"" and the earlier lyrical/musical genius of Blue Oyster Cult. The remake of ""Love Potion #9"" just about made me puke. The only remarkable thing about this album is how completely awful it is, and I'm sorry I shelled out the money for it. It *IS* very aerodynamic, though, and as such, makes one helluva frisbee."
1,Surprised,I must have confused this listing with another. It is a single can -- yes -- a $9 can of baked beans. I thought it was a 3 pack.
1,Dull read - stilted language,"I haven't read Curtiss Ann Matlock in a while, and I have to say I was very disappointed. I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters were two-dimensional, the language used was unnatural and the book was just plain boring. There were too many characters thrown in and side stories. The religious quotes that were thrown in were irritating, because they sounded cliche and were used to support whatever viewpoint the character wanted to justify."
1,This book was VERY poorly written,"I was really disappointed by this book--it is so poorly written and the characters lack substance and the story is pathetic. I had to read it for my book club and was disappointed we chose such a weak selection. The storyline is modest, at best. The main female character in the book only sees her life as being complete if she has a man in it. She's hooked up with a cheating veterinarian and then winds up with a newspaper editor who makes her iced tea. The relationship is shallow, poorly developed and basic. A dumb book!"
5,I Love the Town of Valentine!,"Reminiscent to me of Jan Karon's Mitford books, it's a pleasure to curl up and visit the people you know in the town of Valentine. I read Driving Lessons first and loved it and this one didn't disappoint either. I'm looking forward to reading At the Corner of Love and Heartache."
1,"""Is Birdy Edwards here?""","Well, maybe -- it would be difficult to tell, with this DVD transfer...Any discussion of the artistic merits of ""The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes"" (a 70% faithful, 30% wildly unfaithful adaptation of Conan Doyle's ""The Valley of Fear"") is rendered irrelevant by the breathtakingly horrible picture and sound quality of this DVD. The picture in some scenes looks like it has been recorded by a camera phone off a computer screen where the film was playing on YouTube, while the soundtrack sounds like a video game machine was in continuous use in the room where it was recorded. Needless to say, there are no subtitles, nor any special features other than a catalog of other available DVDs.If the DVD reflects the quality of the best print of ""The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes"" available to the manufacturers, then this important Sherlock Holmes film is in desperate need of a full restoration. Otherwise, the DVD manufacturers ought to be ashamed of themselves for charging money for this."
4,Tough stainless watch with low price,"I bought this casio wathc for I need a stainless case watch with low price. Although casio has a cheaper stainless watch(model:EF305),but its bracelet is made of plastic. Casio AMW700B looks rather tough and its bracelet is made of leather and fabric.The only problem is that it doesn't have the function of compass as it is advised by some website."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this set to use with a new smooth top range. After 1 use, the skillets discolored. I have a set of 20-year old, made in the USA, everyday cookware that is heavier and still shining."
1,Not very good or....,Either this call isn't very good or I got a lemon... I sounds bad and I don't really know how to go about seeing if it's the call or what.
3,Easy going fantasy novel,"The Guardian is xtra-light fantasy with all the common cliches to be expected in such literature: There're the good guys'n girls, who do (almost) everything right, motivated by most honorful intentions. Then there are the ultimately bad guys, who're soulless powermongers and who get either killed or converted (okay, in that case they werent that bad). And in the end the hero gets the (smart) girl (surprise, surprise: the leading female character actually isn't the guardian's ward, which serves as quite a positive twist), the other girl (the ward) gets the good-looking guy, and the smart guy (the hero's sidekick who is providing the most pleasureable scenes) gets the cute girl. At the end, the good ones are all united and everybody is happy and all smiles. Including the reader who just enjoyed a straightforward, easy-going tale with all the ingredients needed for a solid fantasy novel."
4,Habit Rouge By Guerlain For Men. Great Product,"I received this product as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago, it smell so good that I very rearly used it.I like it because the smell stays with you all day, no need for a touchup.I would recommend to my friends."
3,nice enough,"relaxing stuff, averagely executed. listened to it twice, then off to a dusty shelf it went."
2,Superficial and dull,"Made seven years before ""The Desperate Hours,"" this film has a similar plot: a family is held hostage after criminals invade their home. ""The Dark Past"" adds a psychological twist that had the potential to be interesting, but turns out to be a fatal problem. There's nothing here but glib pop psychology of the most lightweight kind, and the movie is both ridiculous and boring as a result. William Holden and Lee J. Cobb struggle valiantly to save the wretched script, but there isn't much they can do."
2,Stick with Crayola,"I bought these for my almost-2 year old son, as we take crayons and a drawing pad with us whenever we go to restaurants. I have soem crayola crayons, which are great, but the cardboard box they come in gets ripped easily, and then the crayons start getting lost. I bought these because they come in a travel case, which I thought would help with the lost crayons issue.Pros would be: good color selection, nice and chunky for small hands.Cons vastly outweigh the pros, and are that the colours are very weak, some barely show up on paper at all (orange, light blue for example) and the so-called ""travel case"" is made of the flimsiest plastic imaginable, more like the stuff that cheap blister packs are made of. I don't expect the ""travel case"" will last any longer than the crayola cardboard.This was a waste of money, and I would recommend buying Crayola crayons, and putting them in a sturdy tin case instead."
5,A Combination of Funk and Jamming Rock n' Roll,"This CD is my favorite out of the many I have. I have searched for a great rock/funk CD for a long time, and have finally found one. This CD provides me with hours of listening. GSW is a great live band that has two lead guitarists/vocalists. The sounds of GSW are similar to Phish, and the GratefulDead. Recorded in NYC, Chicago, White Plains(NY), and Fort Collins(Co). The band plays in bars, but does so greatly. They rock away with every note of their guitars. A really great band, and I am sad to see them go."
3,Almost worth it,"This album comes down to two songs that are REALLY good. ""Driving West"", and ""Feel the Pressure"" I feel these two songs are indicative of the musical and song writing potential within the band. So keep that in mind. But keep this in mind too: Driving West is one of the coolest rock songs you will hear...it's your call."
5,We really like this lamp,This has been installed for about a month on our newly painted gray house.We liked this so much we bought a second one to go over garage door. It was easy to install.
5,How could we forget?,"Never an intense Pat Benatar fan when she hit the scene, I now stand in a certain awe of the power she and husband Neil Giraldo convey on this great evocation of years of playing together. With only a quartet--and NO ryhthm guitar!--they rip through Benatar's biggest hits and add new material that is as fresh as the 21st century. The power of the guitar playing shows Neil to be one of the most versatile musicians in rock music--ever. His command of the instrument is extraordinary in the way he bends the music to his will, and the excitement never stops from riff to riff. Benatar hangs back when Neil is on a roll, but then she smashes back into the song with pipes as limber as ever. She is one of the half dozen truly great female rock stars, as different from Aretha Franklin, Bonnie Raitt, and Janis Joplin as she is unique and trailblazing in her own work. A perfect couple, who, one assumes, have played out their career on a field of battle."
4,A very useful book,I use the Berlitz Basic Italian Workbook in my advanced Italian class. It contains varied and entertaining exercises that provide practice in grammar while preparing the students for different everyday situations. There are a few mistakes in the book but they are insignificant. The book has another advantage: it is affordable. There is no point choosing a textbook that the students can't afford to buy!
2,"Eh, it's pretty generic.","This album lacks the lift, bounce, and drive that makes Irish music so enjoyable to listen to. And with too much reverb, it sounds as if it was recorded in an empty bathhouse. Dave Miller is not a bad fiddle player, but this recording sounds like an American classical violinst who is still learning to play Irish music (which is exacly what it is). It does NOT sound like a real Irish traditional musician. That said, the slow tunes are actually quite pretty, since this is where Mr. Miller's classical training helps him most.If you're interested in Irish fiddle music, there are a great many albums out there that provide a far better example of it than this one. I'd recommend buying them instead."
5,Excellent,"In spite of what anyone else thinks I just love this ablum. It is easy to get fast fiddle music but this is nice and slow and soft. You will catch yourself moving your feet but on the other hand the rest of your body will start to relax. It belongs in any collection of Irish music.Wish he would do another just like it.Almost forgot, it does have other instruments in it besides the fiddle such as banjo and piano."
5,Fabulous pan,"We use this all the time. We use it for sauteeing, stir frying when we don't feel like bringing the wok out, sauces, omelettes, and even frittatas in which the pan goes in the oven. No sense yet of durability, but we're hoping it lasts a long time."
4,Multiple must have!!,"The podee bottle is a little large, so we use the tubing with a playtex bottle..the nipple is kind of funky too so we switched it out with one from the hospital..one of my preemie twins does very well with it, the other not so much..but at least it frees up some time if they want to feed together.. I sit on the couch with my podee baby inis bopee and feed the other one in my lap.. It works very well..the bottom tubing is ling, so u may also want to buy the replacement box of tubes so u can use a smaller tie on bottom if u want to use a 4 or 6 oz bottle.."
3,Can work but not the best,I bought this item so my crying baby could feed while I was driving. After manipulating it several times I changed the nipple and did as others recommended and started the prime of the milk and placed the bottle at the top of the baby seat and it finally worked. Unless there is no alternative I would say this can be usable but it is awkward at best.
2,Buy the double set instead,"If you are interested in this product, but the double one instead - essentially 2 bottle sets for the price of one."
5,Greatest baby bottle ever!,I wish I could have had one of these when I was having babies! At least now I can use with my grandbabies. Totally handsfree! This works great in a carseat. Remember how you used to have to prop up the baby's bottle while you were driving and if the baby moved the bottle fell and you would have to stop the car and prop it back up? Well with the Podee bottle you just set the bottle in the seat next to the baby and stick the nipple into his/her mouth. No more propping! It is absolutely the greatest product since disposible diapers!
1,disappointed mom of twins,I was so excited to receive these bottles as a gift when I was carrying our twins. I had high hopes for Podee after these wonderful reviews. Bottem line is they never worked for us--they are 11 months now and they still do not work. Like the other 1 star reviewer stated the nipple never stays filled. The first time our twins used them one vomited from all the gas in her tummy and my son screamed for two hours from gas pain. A couple months later we had the same problem--no vomit or gas pains but air filled their tummies so quickly they thought they were full when they only had 2 oz! I tried again today and they thought it was an interesting new toy instead of a bottle. I am throwing them away. I wish I had luck like the other reviewers! I could have used an extra set of hands this year. I have never been one to post reviews but had to after such high hopes for Podee.
5,Bridging the generation gap,"At last, a book on the blues that features contemporary artists, let's them tell their story (and doesn't simply repeat the same old biographical details), and bridges the gap to the blues artists of the past. There's something here for all blues fans, whether they prefer the bluesmen and women of previous generations (like Muddy Waters and Walter Horton) or those of today.If you want to learn every single detail about the life of the featured artists (the 49 contemporary artists chosen or those that they talk about) then this probably isn't the book for you. If however you want to find out more about their personalities then this is a must buy. Blues is about feeling and is based on experience and this book gives a great insight into the events that have shaped the music of some of today's foremost artists."
1,Warning! A rip-off!,"Many markets that were listed in earlier editions of this book are not listed this time. Instead, you are referred to a website, which costs extra. The book is now little more than a come-on for the website. This is a very unfortunate development in the history of this venerable publication."
2,Hermes Eau d' Orange Vert,"This is most likely a knock-off, hence the low price. You should spray it on your clothes, not your skin, because it will otherwise be undetectable in a half hour."
1,EEEK!!,"I've been a collector of Scottish folk music for some thirty years. This album, which was given to me by a well-meaning friend whom I proceeded to marry in spite of it, is easily the worst I've ever encountered, and that's a whole lot. Some pieces aren't all that bad, although even those are rendered a little too ""artificially"" for my taste. Others are downright horrible, like the oompah accordion pieces with a steady background disco beat and the incredibly sappy ""Scottish soldier"". This album is to true Scottish folk music what a 19th century London music hall rendition of ""Molly Malone"" is to true Irish folk music (or what all the beerhall ""music"" albums available in the US are to true German folk music). This is what my husband puts in my CD radio alarm if he wants to make very sure that I sit upright in bed in the morning just so I can turn it off right away."
5,"Works so well, I bought a second one","A while back I purchased the Oasis Guitar Humidifier for my Taylor 12 String. It works exactly as advertised. I have yet to experience any leakage problems and it's always very obvious when it needs to be refilled - and refilling it is quick and easy. I was so impressed with the product and became so aware of the need for owning one that I purchased a second one for my (much less expensive, but still valuable) Takamine. I'm hoping it arrives soon since it has been on back order for quite a while now!"
1,"Oh, why so expensive and no free shipping?","Odd, more expensive than Walmart (less than $60), and you have to pay for shipping? No thanks!"
5,Excellent!!!,"The hand cream is excellent. Take it from a nurse. I wash my hands tons of times a day and I have tried many hand creams and this is very, very great! The best thing about it is that it not only moisturizes, it doesn't wash off, it stays on and keeps your hands soft. I'm buying a bunch for christmas gifts for my coworkers.I've found something better since this review, though this cream is very good, but I love Skin Advanced Therapy Moisturizer - Moisturizing Relief for Severely Dry Skin, with Multi-Vitamins, 3.25 oz more. Please give it a try. It is CVS's version of Eucerin. It is greasy at first but doesn't take long at all to sink in. It also doesn't wash off."
1,I don't recommend.,I bought this DVD because my horse is in the first year of basic training. I feel like I have thrown away my money. The video is too much superficial. I do not recommend to anyone.
5,My favorite knives,"I love these knives. They're large and easy to handle with my long fingers, since I'm a novice. They feel very comfortable in my hands."
2,so disapointed,"I bought this phone and was so disappointed because it had great features, and then believe it or not there was no light for the clock. I sent it back thinking that the light must be broken, because how could someone make an alarm clock you can't see the time, but the second one was the same."
5,"I was leary at first to order this for my classroom but NOW,","I'm ordering Bad Boys for all my friends, especially the ones between the ages of 30 and 88! Yeah, I'll get one for my classroom too, but I suspect most of the giggles will be with my friends Merle and Betty!"
1,Falls short of expectations,"The author did a terrific job in her other book ""Grant Writing For Dummies"". I expected more of the same in her ""Consultant"" book. The book is little more than a desktop published brochure. It is particularly irksome given the hefty price of $50 for a 60 page printout. This stikes me as little more than opportunism by the author.My advice is to stick with her ""Dummies"" book. ""How to Become a Grant Writing Consultant"" falls short of the mark."
4,Great Read!,"Recommend this book to all mystery buffs in addition to Christian novel fans. A little gritty for the faint at heart, not your typical mystery. Looks like a great new series."
1,"Poor Quality Control, Not Recommended","The major problems I had with this item are:1. The lens had edge-to-edge streaks on the surface.2. The image had constant blobs that did not move, as if the CCD was dirty.3. The focus cylinder would stick and jump making focusing impossible. A drop of grease could have fixed this.4. The software issued a Windows Certificate warning and has no options to set the install directory. It is a one-shot installation.The microscope is too expensive for such poor quality."
4,Digital Microscope,"This Celestron 44300 is an easy to use fun gadget. It is simple to set up and start taking pictures and video. I guess everyone's first view is their bluejeans, and seeing the patterns in the weave, from there it is the whole outdoors to examine. I doubt it will be the answer to world hunger but it is a lot of fun."
2,Spins in the wind....,I love windchimes and bought these for the delicate sound I thought I would hear...However it spins in the wind because the wood is too light to anchor the chimes.
3,This is a nice windchime,"I have several larger windchimes on my front porch, but I got this one to put out the bedroom window. It has a light, melodius sound and is very nice!!"
4,CD ok for memorization,"I find this CD a great accompanyment to the beginner class that I am currently taking. I am a complete novice in the Spanish language. While the CD does present the course with much repetition and practice, it relies almost entirely on memorization, with little explanation of ""why"" a verb has a particular ending. I find that some basic verb conjugation (from my class) helped me understand better in the memorization portions of this CD. But, all in all, a good CD for use in the car."
5,Great way to get started w/ Spanish & Pimsleur,"This set will give you a pretty good idea of the Pimsleur method. You can read more about their approach on pimsleur.comFrom what I hear, don't expect to finish all 3 levels of their Spanish programs and be fluent. Each Spanish-speaking country has their own variation on words. But this should be a good foundation."
5,Brilliant way of learning to speak,"I found the approach in these CDs extremely effective. I've taught myself Spanish and know the grammar and can read it quite easily but have no experience either speaking or hearing it. These CDs were excellent at attuning my ear to the sound of (Latin American) Spanish. Each lesson reinforces the previous one and gradually introduces new words. Where a word is longer, it breaks it up into syllables to ensure you get the right pronunciation. The little conversations use sensible language that a traveller may well need to use. You don't need any books with it so I found it easy to use (having loaded the CDs onto my iPhone) while I was walking or driving.I can't wait to get the next CDs in the series and also to try them on a language I don't know at all (e.g. Mandarin).On top of everything else, the price was dirt cheap."
2,Spanish,"Not what I expected. This lessons are for someone who has never been around cultures and other languages. Being from Hawaii, we are soaked in it. I'm going through the lessons just to do it, then I'm donating it for someone else to try. I've found this great site called [...]. Very great and challenging site and free!"
2,Annoying...,"I'm sure there are better books on the market for beginners. I started learning VB with John Smileys book which was excellent. Then I bought this one by Peter Write. What a contrast! It feels like the author took a bucket of Visual Basic terms and just sloshed them randomly into the book. He does'nt introduce concepts well enough and leaps irritatingly from one to another. Its probably good for people already well read into the subject. But for a first timer, a definite no no in my opinion. Which is why it shouldnt be called ""begining"" Visual Basic Objects. Some of the final chapters on design are pretty helpful though."
3,A pleasant enough read,"Want a humorous, gentle book to spend an afternoon and evening with? This is a good choice. Everything is quite satisfactory - writing, plotting, characters and the comic sense is delightful. No puzzlements, no surprises but a quiet gentle telling of a quiet no so gentle life in a forgotten costal village. Here people are people - not recognizing love, living lies, engaging in teenaged power struggles, fear of faults or pasts being exposed. Everything hangs together on the thread of what two decades ago was four friends. Now one dead, one widows, one returned from American to settle his father's estate and one delightfully inept plodder. The three survivors slowly see their lives changed as the past is written in light of more information than they understood before."
4,addictive,"I first recieved this cd by mistake when ordering their self titled one. I was immediately captured by the overall quality of the songs. Most of the album cuts can stand alone and believe me there are plenty of them. This cd has grown on me to the point that it is frequently in my cd player, especially in my car. It is just one of those cds that after a few listens begins to kind of creep into your soul. The song Another Soul On My Side has the best( and I mean Best)guitar solo I have heard in years from any band period. I highly recommend this cd and would have given it 5 stars but those cds are rare indeed. This is definitely 4 and a half or bettter though."
2,"If my son didn't really like it, I'd give it 0 stars","I have to agree with the previous reviewer who said this book is disjointed. I cringe everytime I read it to my son (2 yrs). He likes it so we read it most nights before bed.We've never seen the movie (where presumably the gaps, which account for ~50% of the book, are filled in). But, having read the book, I never want to see the movie.Buy this book only if you want to suffer through countless nights reading about how Mr. Conductor gets thrown from Diesel 10's claw to the base of a windmill where there just happens to be a clue to the source of the gold dust. And that's about as much context as the book itself gives you."
4,No problems,I've used this unit to charge Makita 14.4V pod-style NiMH and NiCads -- so far works just fine. Normally it's best to buy something like this as part of a package -- I needed a replacement for an old 14.4 NiCad charger and this unit had the ability to charge those types as wellas the newer NiMH types.
3,Good!,"I have used this commentary quite a bit. It is a very helpful commentary, and Nicholas did a brilliant job on it, even though I don't take the same historic view that he did. Regardless of what position you take in the area of eschotology, you can glean great things from this commentary. The first 3 chapters are as good as any commentary I have seen on Revelation. The commentary is also laid out extremely well in many ways, such as how each and every verse is broken down into sections and explained."
2,An anticlimactic finish to a promising trilogy,"Normally, I prefer not to be a harsh critic, but I feel compelled, given the very positive review above, to offer my own appraisal. I have found THE NIRVANA BLUES to be a disappointment. Nichols' THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR is a well-crafted novel, and worthy of the praise (and even the Steinbeck comparisons) that it receives. The novel's characters display idiosyncracies that are both intoxicating and revealing. THE NIRVANA BLUES attempts to duplicate this, and yet its idiosyncracies, in my opinion, become irritating: more hijinx without substance. Furthermore, the erotic element to the story seems more self-indulgent than necessary. If you have read THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR, and are looking forward to the same quality in the rest of the trilogy, you may be disappointed as well."
3,This version is out of date.,"Amazon is apparently unaware that the Fourth Edition of this book (The New York Public Library Desk Reference) was published in 2002. The Third Edition, which is what Amazon is trying to sell to us, came out in 1998. Don't waste your money on out of date reference material, unless, of course, you are doing historical research.Amazon: Shame on you!"
4,An Excellent General Reference,"I've found this book to be a very handy tool in answering the most common questions. Though, as with any general reference, the details of many items are lacking. This is certainly no replacement for your encylopedias, but it is a very well organize tome containing many of the most frequently asked questions.This book is an excellent starting point for research projects, though for any indepth analysis you will quickly find yourself moving on to other sources.As with any reference, this one is starting to become out-dated (I refer to the 3rd edition from 1998). I'm sure the authors will continually update it so that it continues to be an important source for the answers to most questions."
5,The best drag coffee table book ever...dad will love it!,"Finally, a book about drag that positively revels in the glamour of being a drag queen. No ""who we are and why we are"" rationalizing...it just get deep into the fun and beauty of drag. The book includes chapters on the history of drag, interviews with drag superstars (Lypsynka, Holly Woodlawn, Lady Bunny among many others), drag essentials (get yourself to that MAC makeup counter!) a list of the many movies that feature transgender themes and a great listing of drag nightclubs and events around the world..."
5,English version of Anak by Freddie Aguilar,"Just heard an English version of Anak and wondering who did that version. Have any popular western musicians done a version of this song? Just curious. If you have any information, please drop me a line."
5,"Brilliant, Painfully Honest, Luminous","Rebecca Brown is one of the riskiest, most revelatory fiction writers around. The Dogs is at turns mythical, agoraphobic, profound, and suspenseful. It is easy to miss what makes Brown so powerful, because her prose is full of understatement. But her words are amazingly deliberate, almost incantatory, and the end effect is a terrifying, transcendent thrill ride. The Dogs is a fascinating story and - like other Brown books - an exhilerating read. Brown doesn't take any easy exits, and this is what makes her work so fascinating - it cuts to the heart of the most difficult, inexplicable human emotions and lets the reader dwell there for awhile. I highly recommend The Dogs."
5,Ultrapull - ahead of their 'pop' time,Great album -songs come out kickin' - all in all this band has alot to offer - Its no wonder they rose ABOVE any previous versions of their former bands to get a Record deal and International distribution -theres plenty of Pop and Alternative on this album - Couldve used more mix time -still a heavy contender for International releases in the 00'sWhoever wrote that last review 'Belly Puddle Lite' must have a little resentment built up -hmmm -possibly even gay -San Fransisco -yeah definitely gay
1,Not very useful,"the book is a below average tour book. This book has very little value, if any in purchasing a home in Greece. There is a half page in the book about purchase contracts. no mention of costs, taxes, closing fees etc. It would have been nice if they had an example of a closing statement. Throughout the book they bold stuff that they think is very important. Almost all of this is common sense that you could find in any real estate book in any country. example: If you can't make any appointment call and cancel. another, If you don't know where you want to live, rent first. Even the references in the back are poor. You would do much better by calling the tourist office and telling them, you wanted to buy a home in Greece and wanted information. Overall, this book is extremely general, given little or no details about real estate in Greece and has no value. Don't waste your time."
1,Quick e-File NOT With Tax-Cut,"The software has bugs, if using XP you cannot load the software without downloading a patch. After completing the information there is a second download. Trying to e-file you will get a message that there will be a mid February download needed to complete the e-filing. That is unless there will be a late March update. I should have stuck with TurboTax."
1,Would give it 0 stars if possible,"After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their ""font patch"", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H&R Block has lost this customer."
1,wats up,"I orderd it 3 days ago and it said it was in stock, but I still have not gotten an e-mail from them telling me it was shipped. I would like to know the shipping number. The two reviews are not good but the explanations are rasonable and they seem like they were willing to help"
4,If you like mindless computer games skip this one.,"This computer game makes you THINK. It doesn't have stupid little riddles or mechanical puzzles that you can do mindlessly once you figure them out. I played this game at a friend's house and she kept saying, ""Do you see the significance of this?"" She ended up explaining everything. The only part I didn't like was that you had to walk around to all different places and remember where everything was, so you would really need to take notes. This is not a game you can finish in a week at the end of the day. I give it 4.5/5 stars."
1,Glad these are discontinued,"Emeril has a bad habit of throwing his name on some pretty shoddy products. When he was very popular he tied his name to just about everything he could. These utensils are cheap, melt on low heat, and are pretty much junk. Buy some wooden utensils and save yourself the head ache."
1,Harddrive,"This item is defective. after loading my OS the Harddrive worked, but viewing the screen it appears the harddrive is bad. And I did not have full functions on the harddrive."
3,Lost Promise,"it was like finally there is a self contained nursing info-manual. BUT it would not take u more than the first page, to realise how useless this book is. Information is so disorganized that u start to question the intention of the otherwise intelligent Frye. It might be a next edition strategy. but sufice is to say that he should also add some clarification to difficult terms. This book is definitely not for beginners. it promises a lot but most people i know have stop using theirs. look for resale until an improved edition."
1,"Looks great, feels good, SOUNDS BAD","I purchased this guitar for my son based on the product description and it's smaller size. It seemed solidly built and did not feel like a ""Toy"" guitar and the 185 DOLLARS we spent was definitely not a toy price. But we were(and are) constantly frustrated with it's complete inability to stay in tune and once in tune it will not ""play"" in tune. The neck is not rigid and can be visibly bent with only slight pressure causing total loss of tone. Any pressure beyond the lightest touch on the strings causes horrible tone problems. I have played guitar for 12 years and this guitar is simply USELESS due to tone problems.(even for a beginner) I can not play it, my son cannot play it, and his guitar teacher cannot play it in tune. It is now a wall decoration. I had to buy my son another guitar (an OLP MM1, a fantastic guitar for $200) for his guitar lessons. Save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS GUITAR."
4,Lacking in one important area,"This book is good in its subject matter, and it follows the textbook very closely, but it has no answers! How am i supposed to check if i am doing the questions correctly? Other than that, it is very good and challenging for a beginner."
1,Result: Very Unhappy Customer,I ordered this piece so I could replace my current unworking micro usb charger. When I received this in the mail I received a charger with an unrecognizable charging connector in place of the micro usb charging connector shown in the picture. Since the package is opened I am unsure if I will be able to return it and it was a huge waste of money!!
5,Best pen ever . . .,"As long as I have been writing and as many writing implements as I have ever used, this is by far the best pen."
5,The happiest music on earth!,"This is the perfect antidote for the blues. It is absolutely impossible to feel down once you begin listening to this CD! I put it in the CD player whenever I need a lift. I DARE you to not giggle with glee upon pressing the ""play"" button! If you have fond remembrances of carousel music as a child, you will get goosebumps and feel warm and fuzzy all at once when you listen to this! Why take anti-depressant drugs when you can cure the blahs quickly and naturally with this CD? Like the first CD, this one is a very clear recording."
2,Scottish Bagpipes Cd,"This cd is not as good as hoped. There are 21 songs, and you can only play 14 of them. There are 7 songs missing from this cd. Avoid buying this cd."
2,CASIO WATCH,ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS WATCH IS THE BATTERY LAST ABOUT 10 YEARS!!!!DON'T BUY IT!!!! CASIO SPORT WATCHES ARE THE BEST THO'.
3,good,Casio is a good brand. So far I have not had complaints clock. My father in law uses it all the time.
2,"Good function, poor durability","I bought this watch for a bike race where I needed to keep track of two times (RAAM). After a week the watch worked fine, but the ""crystal"" was easily scratched and the stainless steel ""case"" dented easily. It appears that there is a very thin foil of stainless over a plastic case. I've had a Armitron that took 15 years of abuse and looks better than this after a week.If you're gentle on this watch, or don't care how it looks, it will serve you well."
4,"Good, simple recipes","This cookbook is great for busy, working people who don't have all day to prepare meals. The recipes are good!"
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"This cookbook was given to me as a gift. I am not a TV watcher, so I wasn't familiar with this author, but apparently she's very popular because of her show.I could really benefit from some 30-minute meal ideas, being a busy working mom, but this one isn't doing the trick. I have tried several of the meals--they are mostly all made up of three items--an entree and a side or starter, and a dessert. None of the meals took less than an hour, and I'm an experienced and efficient cook. It's not that I mind spending an hour preparing dinner for my family, but I don't like to see things labeled 30-minute meals when they're not."
5,Easy and Good,Too many times things are easy to make but have no taste. Everything I have made out of this book has been great. There are no strange foods to purchase. Everything can be found at your local grocery store. I can't wait for more cookbooks from Rachel.
4,Love this cookbook!,"I bought this because I love Rachael's show so much, and I have only a little time to make dinner with my kids running around. This book does not disappoint. You do need some advance planning to make sure you have all the ingredients on hand, so I try to choose meals before food shopping day. There have been times though, that I've been able to choose, prepare, and serve a meal from this book within about 45 minutes! I am a bit slower than Rachael is, but even with interruptions these meals are fast. I'm interested now in Around The Clock so I can do breakfasts too!"
2,Not for older eyes,"I ordered this book for my 80 year old mother, a big fan of Rachael's. Unfortunately, the recipes ""highlight"" the ingredients in a pale green ink that actually fades into the white pages. She will not be able to read this book on her own. We'll still enjoy it when I visit (I hope) but that wasn't the intention. I wish the editor had used an easier to read format."
4,Two is better than one...,"I wouldn't say that Rachel's #2 is better than the first, but having both is better than only having one! First, the disclaimer, my husband and I both enjoy Rachel's show. She likes to have fun cooking and that's nice to see.This book isn't gourmet; it is about cooking good food without fuss. That's Rachel's goal -- getting more people cooking, making it accessible, not strict. This means if you are casual about your cooking and want some good fun recipes, then this will work for you. If you are a gourmet wanting some quick recipes, then it probably isn't a good fit.Enjoy!"
2,Recipes far too complicated with lots of cleanup,"I would rename this book ""30 Minute Meals with 10 dishes/pots that take 40 minutes to clean up with $25 worth of ingredients"". These recipes require too many ingredients, take forever to clean up, and are tasty but just not worth the effort. For a better book in the ""quick meal"" genre, I recommend The 15-minute Gourmet: Chicken by Paulette Mitchell. My uncle, a culinary arts instructor, gave me that one as a gift, and it's way easier cooking and cleanup. Rachel Ray is cute and I like her shows, but this book is highly overrated."
5,"Easy, but not ordinary","I'm a fan of Rachael Ray's other cookbooks and of her TV show. I have tried quite a few dishes from this book already, as many have been featured on the show in the last year or so. Rachael's cooking style is not cutting edge gourmet; instead, her dishes are easily made and appeal to a wide range of people. At the same time, however, they have a bit of creative flair that keeps them from being ordinary. The book is not a glossy coffee table model, but is one that you won't mind taking into the kitchen. Rachael's energy and enthusiasm come through in her writing, which makes the book fun to read as well. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
3,Disappointed,"I don't think this video is as great as the other reviewers. In fact, I'm considering returning it because I just don't feel any desire to do any of the practices. I watched the entire DVD first, as I always do before practicing it for the first time, and it seemed very boring to me. I agree with the other reviewer about the boring music and I don't know how to exactly describe it but even Shiva's instructions sounded weird. Rehearsed and forced, maybe? Also when I was watching it it was very hard to distinguish which flow I was watching because there were no color or background changes.Of course, Yoga Shakti is my favorite yoga DVD of all time so I compare everything to that one. This one was dull and didn't seem challenging. Except for maybe the Heart flow evolution sequence which I believe was the one that had a lot of arm balances. All in all I'm disappointed and just wanted to share my honest opinion."
3,"Three stars for readability,","however, I am very suspect about her facts. I know next to nothing about Irish history and this book was recommended to me by a friend as an easy and enjoyable way to get a grasp of their history. While the book is an enjoyable read I noticed about halfway through that Ms. Massie insists Mary, Queen of Scots is the SISTER of Elizabeth I of England. No way, Ms. Massie. Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots was the daughter of James V of Scotland and Mary de Guise. Elizabeth's sister, ""Bloody Mary"" was the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. Anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of British history knows this. This makes me very nervous that her ""facts"" regarding Irish history may be in error also."
5,You're not an idiot!,"Don't worry... you're not an idiot if you decide to read this book. It's just in more of a text book format. I'm half-Irish and in the month of March I decided to check out this great book. It's full of great stories and interesting facts. Who needs a course on Irish history when you can get this textbook-style book for a lot cheaper? From the geography of the Emerald Isle to the food and family, this book covers everything Ireland. Whether you're Irish yourself or just intersted in learning about the fascinating culture of Ireland, you'll love this book."
1,misinformation,"Be careful. There are two CDs with the same name, this one and one with a german beer maid on the front cover. All of these reviews reflect the cd with the German girl. I bought this cd expecting about 40 tunes, and I got the other CD in this cover (Munich street). I was obviously disappointed. This is a real problem for those who play the CD and are no longer able to return it."
3,Voice acting - 0 stars,"I'll never understand why todays game makers insist on using their relatives or a passing salesman for voice acting in games when the games cost millions to make. In Prince of Persia everybody sounds American. One reviewer said it sounded more like ""The Prince of Pasedena"". The game is set in Persia. Is it so hard to find real Arabs with a decent voice? I wouldn't think so. Look in northern New Jersey if you're having trouble finding them.If I went to a movie today and they used an American actor to portray an Arab Sheik, that actor better be first rate cause otherwise it ruins the movie. Same with games. A little authenticity would be appreciated. Same goes for any accent. Were a sophisticated crowd today. This aint nintendo."
3,The Enchanted Cottage,"Old fashion love story. Life is what one makes of it. Don't hold grudges, nothing is important as it was when one was young. Learn to live because life is precious. The ""Enchanted Cottage"" shows what love and life is all about."
5,Happy Movie Lover,My husband loves this movie and I was very happy to have found a way to get it for him. It worked great and the quality was wonderful for an old black-n-white movie. We are very satisfied with both the seller (through Amazon) and the product.
1,Big Mistake,"At first we were very happy to have laptop,but after hundreds of dollars of investing in this!!##** thing I would have come out better buying NEW."
3,its okay,"I bought this and im not happy, it not very fast and it does not run very many games, but i guess it works"
1,Abysmal,"Kate was a manipulative, deceitful thing, even while proclaiming her love and respect for her husband. Jared was quick to judge, but then fell in completely with her treasonous schemes -- and him working for the government!!! He's a pitiful spy, and his friends with him. Plus, all three of them orphans and all happen to earn titles of nobility??? Only the children were remotely worth reading about.Kate, Jared, and the author should be hanged for the indiginities we readers have had to suffer in this sorry excuse for a novel. It only cost me a dollar, and it was a waste of money. There is little pleasure in this book. I should have rated it 2 stars, I guess, but I couldn't change that."
4,Fine existential humor,"Tom Stoppard's convoluted farce plays with identity and the nature of reality. There is a play within a play--a marvelous send-up of drawing room mysteries--and a couple of drama critics who comment on the stage action in rather oblique ways that often make it seem that they may actually be speaking of their relations with the actors playing the characters. Then they enter the action of the play and everyone seems compelled to remain in character. I suppose one could read a lot into this, such as the nature of the roles we play in society or the degree to which the reality we experience is deterministic or preordained, but frankly I just enjoyed the humor. It's too clever by half to be a meaningful statement about the human condition, but just witty enough to be a terrific comedy."
5,The Birchbark House,"I could read The Brichbark House over and over again. It was a sad story when one of the main characters, Baby Neewo, died of some kind of sickness. I don't want to give it all away. I liked the part when Old Tallow said,""I'll take a stick to you if don't eat."" I hope everyone will read it and learn about the Ojibwa ways and language.It made me cry. I felt like I was in the story. All in all, I think everyone should try to read the book."
4,Louise Erdrich's Gift,"The Birchbark House is a beautifully written account of early Ojibwa life on Madeline Island. Historically accurate with the language woven into the story in such a way that the young reader will get the flavor of Indian words. I bought copies for two eleven year old grand-daughter, and now I am buying two more. It does tell of the hard life and it is sad in parts, but what young girl doesn't like a good cry."
2,got kind of sleepy,I know all the fans are going to say this is a bad review.while the characters are good there wasn't any main action/event so i was bored.The author just bables on about how pretty the purse or the kitty looks.while it's good to have detail this book takes it overboard with the describing. which is why i got board. All of the other people in my class didn't enjoy this book much either.this could have been a good book with a few adjustments to the storyline and stuff like that.It's my opion and just think if it's worth it half way through.like i said it could have been better.
4,very good introductory computational physics book,"This was my first comp. physics book and it was easy andvery instructive. I can assure your money is well spent.If you find this book too easy, then you should move on toThijssen's Computational Physics which is intended for the`graduate' level readers.Only 4 stars (not 5) because I don't think that the codesprovided in the book are that useful. Everyone has differentcoding style. What really matters is the physical concepts andnot the numerical receipes."
3,A great intro to Indian cooking,"So far every recipe I've tried has worked beautifully, and the introductory explanations on creating an authentic Indian menu and the in-depth discussions of spices are incredibly helpful.But the production quality is quite poor: the pictures are few and relatively unappealing, and the graphics are amateur.Invest in this book for a good array of starter Indian recipes, not for the lush reading experience."
3,In U.S. Indian cooking not well understood,"And I'm not much better off with this cookbook. While I think some of the very basics may be covered, I still do not feel comfortable with making an authentic Indian dish. I do much better watching You-Tube. I love my own version of chana masala. I use a lot of fresh and dried turmeric, ground cumin, and whole cumin seed. Is there someplace else I should be looking?"
5,Highly recommended,"Fabulous book! Every recipe I have tried so far has turned out great. I already knew a bit of Indian cooking and I have learned many new techniques from this book. Wonderful recipes, from simple/everyday recipes to very fancy food."
5,A must have for indian food fans!,"When i bought this book from Amazon.com, I had never cooked Indian food before, but since the reviews all looked good i decided to purchase it. Well, needless to says I was very impressed with the book! All the recepies I tried turned out great and I now use it at least twice a week. My only complaint would be with the weight mesurements (in Ounces) for some of the ingredients, but the end result more than outweights this minor anoyance. I strongly recommend this book to anybody interested in cooking great home made Indian meals."
4,Gentle humour,"I've just finished the paperback of""The Sea for Breakfast"" and was enchanted by it's gentle humour.This isn't a tale which has you going into great guffaws,but rather,keeps a smile on your face right through the book. Anyone who enjoys rustic humour and quiet wit, will thoroughly enjoy this charming,gentle look at life in the Hebrides."
5,Powerful book,Its a excellent book. It is a God giving tool how to win the battle of anxiety. The book came in a excellent condition. And was delievert fast. Thank you
2,Boring music. Dreadful singing.,"I really liked 'True to Yourself'. Not the most original material, but the guy's got at least the pretense of a stile of his own. It had great guitar and good singing. So I was really disappointed with this album. It's not just more of the same -- it's difficult to distinguish most of the songs on this record from each other, and they're all sticky from the clichés. The real problem though is that his singing style is brought to an extreme here. He's become a parody of himself. To the point that I get annoyed listening to some of the songs (I can't listen through the whole of ""I'm on my way""). His guitar playing is still awesome, though."
3,Some Good Advice...... silly format,This book has a lot of good advice (albeit not great) and offers some ideas and help for the business traveler. But..... I agree with another reviewer that the format is unappropriate and at times frustrating.I would much rather have the raw facts and advice and skip the cartoons.Some of the advice in this book is just too silly and not worth the ink because hopefully all of us have basic common sense (i.e. don't get drunk at a clients....please!).It's an interesting book if you can get past the silliness. There are good points that all business travelers should be aware of to help them suceed while on the road.
4,"Comfortable and Convenient, Very Small","Nearly all of the claims for this product are true, with a few caveats.It is indeed very easy to attach and will not come loose until you want it to. It's also very comfortable, easy to open without detaching it from your clothing, and the wicking fabric really makes a difference in keeping you cool.However, as soon as you put anything even remotely bulky in it, it becomes quite uncomfortable. Although my cell phone (very small) fits inside, I can't run with it in the pouch because it pushes into my hip, flaps up and down as i am running, or pops the top of the pouch open. Basically all I can fit inside are my keys and a folded $5 bill. If that's all you want to carry, it's great. But if you're looking to bring along anything larger than tiny MP3 player, you'll have to deal with some discomfort."
3,"If you love Stewie, this is fun","Great gag gift for someone who loves Stewie! I personally think the face is not quite right, but close enough. Also, the recorded clips don't sound ""exactly"" like Stewie on the show. Not sure why. Further, you cannot choose the clip played, rather each time you hit the button, the next clip in sequence plays. Nevertheless, for a gag gift, it fits the bill nicely. Have fun!"
4,Was just a gift,"This was just a gift for a friend to replace her old one, it was pretty cool, it got me a first date."
5,It's just fun....,"This is a fun game, who cares if the graphics aren't up to todays high res. If your a Doom or Duke Nukem fan, and/or just one of those who love first person shooter games, I say ,get it.You'll have hours of fun with this game."
2,Not what I hoped for,"Amazon amazed me with the fast shipping, and uncle mikes let me down. This holster is not comfortable, and isnt made well at all. I like Uncle Mikes products, so even though the guy below me said it was junk, I took a chance for myself.... Should have listened. It is not made well (cheap) and doesnt fit good, even though I used the cheap velcro straps to adjust to my size (6 foot, 225 lbs, average build). Oh well, none of the less, I will wear it when fishing or around the house."
5,Great shoulder holster,"I bought this holster for my son to use in the field with a small 9 mm auto pistol he has for personal protection, so it is exactly what I wanted for him and this new pistol. It fits him fine, it also fits the gun perfectly, so that is all you can ask a holster to do, this one does it to a tee. I like Uncle Mike's Holsters anyway."
4,review of Pain ; clinical manual,set book for a course i takingcomprehensive covering all aspects of the course contentuseful tool in research for the course
5,A Powerful Book For Those Caring for Patients in Pain,"Ms.McCaffery and Ms.Pasero's excellent tome on the realms of our population suffering from pain is one of the finest I have ever read.I am a physiologist that has been active in the care of pain patients for many years. What the authors have provided us is an amazing compulation of help, scientific and clinical pearls that will help us help others.PLEASE purchase this excellent book if you are a health care provider who deals with pain issues, or a patient or family member who deals with a patient experiencing chronic pain.Pain is an invisable disease. The authors examine all elements of treatment of a complete realm of pain conditions and treatment options.James Hagen, MS Co-Founder, and Advisor, The National Pain Foundation"
5,Pain: Clinical Manual,"It is not often one finds a text that is useful on a day to day basis. This text is truly a gem in providing information for physicians, nurses, technicians and other personnel who deal with people living with pain on a day to day basis. Numerous charts, diagrams, understandable explanations are attractive. The amount of reproducible information alone (patient education materials, pain evaluation assessment tools, etc.) make this book a MUST HAVE!!!"
5,PAIN MANUAL,"GREAT BOOK! I purchased this book for school, and I heard they are releasing a new edit. I have had some thought of purchasing the new one just have it on hand....I believe it would have more current up to date info! I have learned TONS from this book. It is BIG and sort of intimidating....but once I really read and sorted through the information I learned how much I truly loved this book, the information in it, and the authors!! I also LOVED my pain class!"
2,blah,"This is a seriously inferior product.Its not very bright, has no dimmer and the adjustment angles aren't great. The power chord or short as well."
3,pcats study guide,Book was purchased for our daughter. Since it is a study guide we will have to wait and see!!
3,Not a book for begginers,"At the time I bought this book, it was the only one available in my local bookstore. I had a project that required me to write a VxD in less than a month, and having never written a VxD, I hoped that this book would gain me quick and dirty insight into the basics of writting one. I found it extremely difficult to follow with not enough explanations of the basics. It seemed to be written for the x86 expert who had already written numerous other types of drivers. I was forced to reread it numerous times while researching other sources of information so that I could understand. There is too much appendix, and not enough examples. It is also chalked full of little annoying typos. The project presented by the author should have been more verbose in the explanantions - I sure would have appreciated it at the time."
4,Wonderful Description of the Human Spirit,"The Crew of the RTL-Timex, a racing sailboat, was faced with diaster and recovered from it. Their sailboat capsized in rough seas between Bermuda and New York and they spent more than a week waiting for rescue. They were fortunate to be in shiping lanes, and see 5 ships before they finally got rescued! The author and the survivors wrote a section with survival tips and necessary materials that every salior should know about. A great read!"
5,A Masterful Work,"Pinel's Biopsychology is a masterful work. I can only imagine the immense amount of time and effort that has gone into it. I don't think you can find another book in this field that appeals to such a wide range of readers. I have used this book and previous editions of it as the primary text in the graduate Biopsychology courses I have taught over the past 8 years. This book has consistently earned accolades from my students for presenting what is an otherwise complicated and highly technical subject, in a graspable and witty manner."
4,"""Names from East Africa"": A Review","This booklet is not that many pages long. It mainly contains personal name definitions of people of Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, and Congo (Zaire)...which are part of the area known as the ""African Great Lakes Region."" Some of the name interpretations are lengthy and commendable, while others are quite short. Written in the late 1970's, the book still stands out as one of the first book efforts on East African names. Since then many more books, many of them much larger, have been written on African names as the research and interest grows."
4,one of my favorite Little Golden Books,"Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, and friends are all set to go on a picnic. They've got a basket full of goodies (I can still recite the contents by heart), including a Great Big Chocolate Cake. But they decide not to let Donald Duck know about their plans, because he has a way of being a pest and has taken the fun out of other outings. He finds out about it anyway, and tracks them down so he can secretly sabotage their swim and steal their lunch. Upset, the others start home and come across the sight of Donald having his own picnic. Cheerfully he invites everyone to partake- but the food looks suspiciously familiar! Mickey Mouse's Picnic teaches kids social morals within a funny plot."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, BAD!","What a sickeningly wretched movie. It's so bad, it's beyond belief. Buy it to laugh at it hysterically!"
5,Jouney To Topaz,"Journey to Topaz is a great book. I love the advanced words in it and the way that the author throws in Japanese words into it. My reading teacher said that the school didn't have enough books to supply all of us with books, so I had to get a photocopied book. But it was such a great book, I'm going to beg my parents into buying it on Amazon.com! I think my teacher should have gone onto Amazon.com and bought us books so we could have the pleasure of having a real copy! I think Journey to Topaz is the best book I have ever read, because it teaches you that not only the Jews were affected by World War 2, but the Japaneese were affected as well, just as much as the Jews. It was also a breaking to the constitutional laws. Yoshiko Uchida(the author of the book) says it was uncalled for. I think that this book is great-five stars is definitly underestimating it!"
4,FUN LITTLE BOOK ....,"This was an interesting read by an interesting character with an interesting sense of humour. Al Kooper is one of those musicians and artists that never hit superstardom, but had a long successful career nevertheless.He also had contact throughout his career with numerous superstars and wannabee superstars in the music industry which led to his wild and crazy stories in the book. The guys seems to know everyone in the industry or did know everyone in the industry. He was fired more often than Donald Trump's apprentices and walked off as just as many jobs. I can understand how he started to run out of employment options towards the end of his career.It was nice to read a book from a rocker that was not filled with stories about self-inflicted drug abuse and over the top womanizing. Although he had his bouts with pain killers and had several unsuccessful marriages, that seems to be the extent of his wildness.Entertaining book, worth reading if you can find it at a decent price."
4,Backstage Passes,Very Interesting. I was surprised/diasapointed that he didn't have anything on that album he did with Shuggie Otis.
2,a no-one who despite his best efforts will always be a no-one.,"I read the book and still don't know why he is given any consideration and feel I wasted the hours it took to read the thing. I read many bios, rock & otherwise and just don't get it. Lots of people were around the rock scene in the 60's and have interesting tales. This man has none. Exept maybe the ability to write and sell 2 books. I don't understand the high reviewer ratings."
4,"Excellent, but pricey","We love these crackers, but I don't love the price. I'm not entirely certain why the price is so much higher than other crackers. We will likely continue to buy them though."
3,A light desert,"This is a crispy cracker with a light nutty flavor. When you have cheated on your diet and have eaten gluten, this is a wonderful satisfying snack for when you are back on track eating properly. Try placing 3 or 4 crackers on a desert plate, lace with maple syrup or honey and top with chopped pecans. Heavenly with a cup of tea or coffee."
2,meh,"The art is not what I expected from clamp. The book is small, thin, and a very short read. It has a few tiny stories that are several pages long. I'm a huge clamp fan. I love their work. Chobits. Xxxholic. Tsubasa. Rayearth. Ccs. I. Love. Clamp. I adore clamp. This book though did not meet my expectations. Its ok at best. Its just a bunch (correction: few) of unrealistic thoughts on love and relationships that would make any adult (and I'm only 21) scoff. Really? Maybe you have to be a hopeless romantic with a really open heart and an empty glass of wine to enjoy this.. whatever ill keep it fo the sake of collecting."
3,Luv Books,"The description online ""read chipped front DJ"". I was very disappointed with the condition of the DJ. It was much more than chipped. Torn would have been a more accurate word. I realize that this book is very old, but I expected the DJ to be in better condition. The good news is that I wanted a DJ, wanted it shipped from the U.S., and I didn't pay much for this book."
5,Fun movie,"If you like 80's movies with cheap plots and unnecessary nudity, then you'll love this movie. The acting is better than in Dolomite and the ladies are beautiful. It's a good movie to watch when you are bored with the usual Oscar winning movies."
2,Fun,"Ok. I can't tell whether the Invisble Maniac is intentionally cheesy or not. It is clear the film makers are poking fun at themselves and other ""B"" films, namely slasher movies, but this film is funny either way, simply because of the overacting and horrible special effects. But if you are looking into renting or purchasing this movie, overacting and horrible special effects should be exactly what you expect.If you're a fan of Troma films then you know what to expect. Rent it if you can."
4,Face the Nation,"Bob Schieffer, moderator of the last Presidential debate and moderator of Face the Nation, has written a second book of memories. In it, he recounts the successful CBS show ""Face the Nation.""It is a good read. Unfortunately, there's not quite enough meat in it. The book is over almost before it began. It comes with a 2-hour DVD that I am planning on watching soon. I hope it includes some of the remarkable stories included in the book; the McCarthy interview, the Ali interview, and most importantly, the great Martin Luther King, Jr.Schieffer has a natural gift to tell a story, and it's a worthwhile read."
2,Didnt see any growth and smelled like brunt bacon!,"I bought this stuff bc i was too cheap to buy the Mega-tek. Boy was i wrong, it stinks so bad and it would run down my face at night even day. I used it for a month and a half and decided to buy Mega-tek lol. So lesson learned!"
1,Makes hair fall out!,"Based on the reviews that MTG will help mane and tail hair grow, I decided to try it on my horse. I used it twice as directed, with 1 1/2 weeks between applications. 3 weeks after the first application all the hair under my horse's mane, tail, and forelock was GONE!! I don't know how they can advertise for a product that grows hair when in fact it causes it to fall out! He looks horrible!"
5,Wish it was still with us...,"I first got this book from the local library about 10 years ago. I made the mistake of returning it to renew it later - I say mistake, because the book was so popular that all the copies were susequently stolen! I searched for this fantastic book for years, and then by sheer luck I ran across Joe Oldham who graciously gave me a copy. If you are looking for one of the best sources for pre 1981 Firebird/Trans-Am information, this is it. There is a very detailed history of the car and it's builders (the people, not just GM!). As well there is a very detailed and technical wealth of information on chassis tuning, Pontiac specific engine work (heads to cranks), production numbers, casting numbers... the list goes on.If Mr. Oldham ever puts this book back in print, I'm sure there would be a flood of orders for it as the early F-bodies become more and more popular and collectible as time goes on.Firebirds forever! Thanks Joe."
5,Life science,The perfect slides to use in Life Science class. The students enjoyed seeing everything that were on the slides. Perfect for the child who loves science.
3,Not too bad,"I bought this for my 8 year old who had received a microscope for her birthday. This is a nice set of slides, and she found them interesting (and it brought make memories of 7th grade biology for me, lol). If I were to suggest any changes they would be to find more specimens that are common objects that kids are likely to be familiar with (she was much less interested in the slides if she didn't know what the thing was to start with). Also, the wooden box is a great idea, but it's a little too large, so the slides slip out of their slots and get jumbled/scratched up."
3,Broken!,"I had bought these slides for my 11 year old daughter who had just recieved a microscope. When they arrived, two of them were broken! Luckily, the specimen was not damaged, so they were still okay to use. I think those slides broke because the wooden box was a little too big for the slides to fit in. Each slide was labeled with the name of the specimen that you were looking at. There were some spelling mistakes on the labeling on the slides, but everything on the little sheet that had all the names on it was spelled correctly. For example, the sheet said that specimen #22 was part of a Dog's Small Intestine. The label on the slide itself said it was part of a Small Lntestine. Intestine was spelled incorrectly. Overall, these slides are a pretty good quality."
3,Mustard,"This is not bad, but be aware there is relish added to it. It tends to stop up, then come out in massive quantities."
1,lousy,"There is a very good reason this book is out of print. It does not even begin to come to current codes. I don't think it could have possibly came to code anywhere in this country when it was written. The illustrations are cartoonish at best. the instruction is cumbersome and a difficult read. The designs are the bare basic. Although there are many 'designs' they are all the same. The plans are all basically the same and by showing one or two of this type would have been enough for the reader to adapt to whatever positioning they needed. However it goes over and over and over the same plan with a tweek here and there rather than exploring different plans foundations, drainage and the like. There are much better books out there. Also the seller listed this book in good quality and it was riddled with underling and reader notations that were just...well. I would not recommend this book."
4,Very nice,"I've owned this book light for a couple of months of very undemanding use, i.e., 1-2 hours per session, 3 or 4 times a week. The light is strong enough for comfortable reading, but without producing any heat or waking my companions. I wish I had bought one of these long ago...."
1,never worked,"The watch never worked. I gave it to my 5 year old nephew, he was so excited to use and wear it. But when we opened it and tried to turn it on it would not work. Never turned on ."
4,The 1st review,Okay...well if ya dont Know....DCS is the Two Singers from Project Wyze and a new DJ. Thisnew band is allot different that P Wyze. Instead of rock...with Guitars....their using beats with maybe a little guitars...and if you like that..This is a good cd....Most of the songs are good....and the lyrics are close to the same as where in P Wyze songs...its a cool cd.4 out of 5 Stars
3,An OK Beach Read,"I purchased this book because the setting was in Italy and I was traveling there at the time. It was very predictable, but highlighted the countryside and traditions of the characters...would not recommend to my friends."
1,You are cursed with a curse? NOT!,"""You shall eat in the presence of the Lord your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe..."" Deut. 14:27 If you grow the food, you eat your own food, as a thank offering, 10 percent of it, in a feast. But on the 3rd year you should give it to the Levites AND the orphans and widows. Robert Morris happily skipped God's definition of the tithe in the Law, so he could curse you with a curse if you don't give your cash to the local church."
3,Impossible to do on your own,"I agree with other reviewers that without doing this in a protected area it can get very messy. I have assistance using the device and we use soft sponges to help even out the tan and it works much better. You can line your area with plastic before starting,I would suggest using it in the bath, still line the area with plastic, you can use a cheap shower curtain to hang on the back side of the shower and make sure you clean up immediately afterward.I give the product 3 stars because with the right assistance it can turn out just as good as a spray tan from the tanning salon."
4,A look at Historical Geography of the NC Outer Banks,"I was happy to receive this book from the early Fifties. So much has changed about the Outer Banks in the past 60 years that it was good to be able to look back and see the situation there as it existed at that time. The book was in good condition for a copy so old, and it had several areas of history inside that I was pleased to be able to read. It really helped put the development of the barrier island chain into perspective. I'm glad I was able to find a copy and purchase it."
2,Smaller than I expected!,This unit would work well in a very small car. Seems to be well made just to small. The vender I used also charges to much for shipping this product.
3,its true about the suction cups!,"I read all the reviews for this product and I was forewarned about the suction cups. I thought, well, just maybe I would be one of the lucky ones to get the suction cups to work. Nope. Great product, EXCEPT for the suction cups. It was the right price and the right size, so I bought it anyway and went to the hardware store and bought better suction cups for $1 each and am using them. RESULT: It has not fallen down since I installed it with the better cups. NOTE: the ring comes off the back of the suction cups and you can then pop them out. Take one with you to the store, it has a pretty small diameter that will fit back into the shade hole, so find one comparable. The ones I got were just a little bit bigger than the hole, but I was able to squeeze them in there with a little elbow grease. Was it worth the trouble, yeah, pretty much. I have not had a screaming toddler since I installed it because it does shield him from the direct sun in his face."
2,Anxiously awaited but ultimately disappointing,Sorry to say I found this not as engaging as Dream A Little Dream or It Had to Be You. Lady Emma was not a character I empathised with and the thread of the story was quite predictable. Liked the secondary romance. Please write another book soon Susan!
3,Made the Grade: Lady Be Good by Susan Elizabeth Phillips,"3 out of 5 stars! I lovedFancy Pants-- I was so excited to read this story (Lady Be Good: A Novel) since it takes the main characters fromFancy Pantsand made them secondary characters in this one ..... and when it's done right just makes it all the better! Lady Emma and Kenny have a good relationship and I love reading the chemistry between them. However, I think the end was a little rushed for me. But I did like how their final argument played out!!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny, Touching & Romantic",Lady Be Good was a very funny and informative book. Kenny's character as a pro golfer on suspension that was a very clever idea. His attitude towards the english head mistress was very entertaining. The rival going on between them was outstanding! I loved this book because of the originality and the spirit of all the characters. If you ever read any SEP's books than you know already know how talented and creative she can be. Be prepare to add her name to the other bestsellers you know. Guaranteed to enjoy again and again.
3,I wanted to like it more!,"I'm a huge SEP fan from the beginning of her career, but there was something about this book that left me lukewarm. I've loved all of her books. I especially loved the depth of her earlier books because you could always count on her to make you laugh and break your heart in the same book. (I actually enjoyed the more serious DREAM A LITTLE DREAM.) I understand her shift to ""lighter fare"" since that's what's selling right now, but LADY began to feel very formulaic in its approach. The book did get better toward the end, especially with the cameos from Dallie and Francesca from FANCY PANTS, but overall, it made me sigh. I hope this isn't the case of an editorial staff encouraging an author to write the same book over and over to be successful because that would be a tragedy in SEP's brilliantly talented case."
4,couldn't put it down,I couldn't finish reading this book fast enough. I read it in 2 days..I found this book to be very helpful for my situations with my 2 year old son.
5,Comfort while wearing glasses,"I'm not a stereophile and can't really speak to lack of bass notes, but while listening to the 70's classic ""American Pie"", I heard lovely high notes and tones I've never heard in 30+ years of listening to this song.What I like -* Nice clear sound that actually differentiates between ears.* Very comfortable fit in my medium-size ears. I use the sponge covers.* Around-the-back cord - I wasn't sure why the cord was asymmetrical until reading another review.*Ear hooks are super comfortable, even while wearing glasses, which I do all the time.*I can turn down the volume and answer the phone without removing the ear buds.I'm listening to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" while writing this - excellent listening experience."
3,so-so,"Hello, this is my first review. so i will treat it very seriousThis is a good earphone, nice style and good performance.However if you really do not need this, do not buy it.This one fits well in my ear. however the sound is not loud because it can not stick into your ears, and you may feel uncomfortable with it.be conscious."
3,"Good, but not great.","Notes:-Very comfortable, I can even wear these with my glasses (pleasant surprise).-Somewhat secure, I can jog with them. When I wipe my brow with a towel, sometimes it gets loose. Cord as usually gets in the way. Combining secure with comfort, I'd say it does a very good balance, moreso than most products.-Sound, better bass noticed compared with generic phones.Biggest gripe... sound is probably 25% quieter than my generic phones.Overall, very good phones. Pump up the sound and these would be a 4 rating. I paid twice as much for these at a chain store (in Cdn $)."
5,Great Resource for Anyone Who Wants to Be a Better Communicator,"Speak Like a CEO is a great resource for anyone who wants to improve their presentation and speaking skills - not just CEO's. Bates provides solid advice for people at all different levels starting with ""what not to do"" or common mistakes. This book is an easy read packed with tips and colorful examples. Great for leaders and future leaders alike!"
2,Not what I expected,"I usually listen to Dave Ramsey audio books and books like ""The Secret"", but this audio wasn't very aspiring. I didn't listen to the whole book and would probably give it away."
2,Heard it but did not buy ...,"In guided meditation the voice of the ""artist"" is almost as important as the music. Unfortunately, Dr. Gaynor's voice is a tremendous detractor that I simply could not get past. I liked the meditations, but would never be able to truly focus with his voice doing the guiding."
5,A Wonderful Book,"I have read this book many times in the past ten years. It is inspirational and very real.To a qigong practitioner, it is a moving documentary of our roots of healing, as well asglimpses into the sacred mountains many will never be fortunate enough to see. It is atrue experiential treasure, that takes you away to another reality, a very beautiful andstrong one, that is the roots of all of Chinese medicine.I am grateful the authors took the time to have this adventure and write about it, to sharewith others.As a practitioner of Chinese medicine, who has studied in China and also gone to Huang Shan,(not Hua Shan in the book, which is far more challenging!) I can truly personally appreciatethis book as well. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have an inside look and experiencethat is humble and heartfelt, and better understand the roots of the healing arts of China."
5,Great reading enjoyment!,"This book reads like an adventure story but it is all true...Bill Porter speaks Mandarin and has many friends in China so he could travel into territories where few Westerners are able to go without a guide. He won the trust of many hermits high up in the mountains of China and tells a wonderful tale of their survival against all odds...Sadly, they are a dying breed and the last of a generation who dedicated themselves to a monastic life of meditation and living without wordly goods. A really good read! Marilynn Seits"
4,Elementary Overview for the Newcomer,"This is a very basic introduction to equity hedge fund investing. the portion of the title ""The Easy Way to Get Started"" is probably a bit misleading - it is the equivalent to a ""Dummies"" level book on hedge funds - but written in a bit more serious tone. The information is pertty good - if getting somewhat dated given current events.I find it interesting that the author almost predicts the current hedge fund debate when this was written back in 2002. He also makes it clear that in his opinion, more regulation doesn't necessarily mean less risk.The book is good for the first timer in the space, or someone who is trying to get a basic understanding of what a hedge fund is and what equity hedge funds do."
5,Excellent Primer on Hedge Funds and the Industry,"This book delivered what I was looking for and more. I needed an introduction to hedge funds and the industry and the book does an excellent job of providing this information in complete and concise detail. In addition, the book also gives a good overview of portfolio theory and how it relates to actual practice. There is also a section that describes the prevalent hedge fund strategies with historical performances. I highly recommend this book to those interested in starting their own fund or wishing to work in the industry."
2,a little too simplistic,"Not my favorite cookbook. I love Rachael's show, and I don't own any of her other books, but I thought for sure I'd love this one. Way too simplistic for above-average cooks, in my opinion. Few photos and even fewer inspired ideas. I am reluctant to try her other books now."
3,SORRY RACHEL BORING,Im sorry Rachel Cookbook is Boring and doesnt inspire you to cook..Recipes Im sure are good however you didnt put any love into this book...feels slapped together...
3,photo quality- ugh!,"As a college instructor, I will be using this book for my class this spring. I am so disappointed in the quality of the photographs, I can do better on my home scanner. Many are indiscernable..........I see from the credits that the photos were taken by the author's son. Good photos certainly can enhance the quality of the textbook. I am unable to find any educational info on this author. The book and online bios state that she has 30 years of experience in her field (so do I) but I can't find any information on her degrees or education."
5,"Celestron 44412, 100 prepared microscope slide set","For use in home schooling a 16 year old granddaughter I could not have found a better selection of general biology slides for the price. Almost without exception, the prepared slides were equal to the quality I used in the classroom as a forty one year public high school science educator and coordinator. We use them with a Celestron LCD microscope also purchased through Amazon with excellent results. The slides are thinner than I used professionally years ago but of excellent quality. Thus, I cautioned my granddaughter to start viewing under the lowest power objective first before switching to higher power. The slides are are accurately labeled in general names and come in a well made slide box with a numbered list of the organisms. I scanned other science specimen sources also and did not find such a comprehensive set near the economical Celestron-Amazon price."
2,"I love Hax, but not this book","I recently started reading Carolyn Hax's daily columns and weekly chats. I really enjoy her wit and wisdom, so I came looking to see if she'd written any books. I am about half way through this book and I really don't care for it. She has so much more humility and compassion now than she seems to have when she wrote this. I know, it was 10 years ago, and that's probably why. But honestly, it felt a little harsh, and a little smug. I wonder what she thinks about this book now, looking back. It's not awful, just not _her_, at least in my opinion."
1,Down the Road,"I can only say that this is the first right wing, anti-government, tea party zombie book. And it is absolutely terrible. I am somewhat dumfounded by some of the high reviews. I feel that the author may have written this when he was 15 years old with advice from his crazy militia uncle. I will not even trade this book in at the used book store.I would feel guilty if someone else paid money for it. Straight to recycle."
3,Kind of dissapointing,"This book wasn't what I expected,its more about the residents of the town than the zombies.I had high expectations for it because I saw a lot of advertisements for it,but when it came down to it it fell short."
2,Inspiring....but not in the way you might think!,"This book is awful. When I said it is inspiring I meant it--it is inspiring to know that garbage like this can actually get published and it makes me realize that if a novel like Down The Road can get into print then hey, why can't I write a zombie novel and have it get into print as well?I am a better writer than this guy and I haven't finished college! I can write my own zombie novel, use every cliche ever imagined, throw in some totally asinine scenarios, incoherent subplots and ill-placed sex scenes, and la-da-da--I will be done! I'll even be my own editor and know my book will have less typos and misspellings than this one. Even classic band names are spelled incorrectly (""Def Leopard""????)It's late, I am tired and in a hurry so this is not one of my better reviews but damn, I saw all the 4 star ratings and only a couple lower so I had to do something."
5,amazingly amazing,"This is pretty much the best book ever written. It's awesome, period. It has all of the elements of a soon to be blockbuster feature film. This Ibarra fellow is the most astonishing writer of his time. ""Down the Road"" has inspired me not only to read books more often, but to become a better person all around. Thank you Bowie Ibarra...thank you."
1,Zombie porn?,"The story was decent but I couldn't get through it. It seems every time the author got a chance he would put in a completely unnecessary sex scene. Now I'm no prude, but zombies and porn don't mix. I love BBQ sauce and chocolate ice cream but I don't ever mix the two. A better title for this book might be, ""Dawn of the Head"", or ""69 Days Later"". RIDICULOUS."
3,Thoughtful stuff,"Like its forerunners, MOF turns on the notion of subversion. Unlike its forerunners, it forgoes a certain page-turning heat in favor of cooler, deeper analysis. This may put off some readers; it didn't put me off. Can you conquer social or political demons without conquering your own? I don't know, but I love this author for tackling the question.Foy writes with sensuality & immediacy; MOF has the same scary sense of place as his previous novels. He has an unsettling talent of creating scenes you can't forget even when you try to.This is a super-ambitious novel. For one thing, a male author is trying to create a credible female protagonist. For another, it's in part about music, and ""writing about music is like dancing about architecture,"" as somebody once said. These are high hurdles, but in my opinion, Foy clears them."
1,Don't recommend,"As a therapist, I have seen far more effective books. I was supremely disappointed by this book. Far better books on the market."
4,A good way to boost kid's confidence,"Since I read many good reviews on this book, when I got it myself, I was a little disappointed. I read for my 2-and-half-year-old a few times, then she does not want it any more. She loves books with more ""stories""."
3,Smaller than a quart,"Nice item. Solid and well made. But the volume is less than a quart! when filling with water, I can barely get 3.5 cups (to the brim) in there. It is not a quart. And I needed at least a quart. Otherwise great product."
2,Not impressed with Ipod so far,After hearing lots of raves of the IPod I finally broke down and got the new 4th Generation. It worked for approximately 1 1/2 weeks before it died. Maybe I got the bad one in the batch or maybe Apple hasn't perfected this new generation yet... but It had to be reset twice... wiped out my music library once and then after charging today.. does not respond to any button presses at all. After spending at least an hour with Apple Tech support .... They offered to replace it.. which is nice. I am still holding out hope that my next IPod will work properly but this first Ipod experience has left me very cold to the Ipod and Apple in general.
4,Good book,"I love Archbishop Pilarczyk, he is wonderful in his explanations and give a great amount of information to help one understand. This book did not read too easy for me, not sure why but I used the book as part of a online class that jump around reading certain chapters together and not in order, maybe that's why? My preference is the book ""This is Our Faith."" but I've just started it as a class followup."
4,Great for storing my lens filters!,"As an avid photographer, this filter case was just what I needed to store the various filters I use with my 35mm/digital lenses. I only wish that it had a built on belt clip and attached lid so that I wouldn't have to stop and open it, pull out a filter, put the filter in it's harness on the lens, then reclose the filter case before continuing to take additional pictures. A hard plastic case with a belt clip and attached lid would make switching out filters so much easier and I wouldn't miss as many shots during important moments like in weddings, birthdays, etc. Overall though, it's a great product to keep my filters from getting scratched, broken, or lost while being stored. :)"
5,So good it should be re-issued as an illustrated booklet,"Sometimes we need to read good and true stories. Reading C. Roy angel is a new experience for me. I actually thought he was out of print. I want to give copies to the grandchildren, for they could be re-done into illustrated short stories. The writing is so vivid, I can picture the scenes and the situations. Tried and true classic!"
3,"Eh, borrow if from someone, it's not worth buying","This book covers some basic info on the ""monologue"" and has many interesting pages about monologues and the audition process. The monologues aren't that great and it's not worth the effort to study them. I hope this helps..."
2,Not what I expected,"For the price it was fine. However, the ad did not mention that there were only 2 of the 6 disks for the program listed. Everything else was fine, I still would have made the purchase but would have been nice to know that it was just the first two disks in advance. Shipped quite quickly and looked in very good condition. Gave only two stars due to the incomplete info."
4,A Fine Introduction to Rumpole,"I had rather low expectations for this first-ever appearance of Horace Rumpole, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how well developed the Rumpole character was right from the get-go. Many of the hallmarks of the long running series are here: She Who Must Be Obeyed, the Penge Bungalow Murders, frequent recitations of Wordsworth, corrupt detective inspectors, and small cigars. Even son Nick makes an appearance (although he's in a bit of a foul mood). The only thing I found jarring was Rumpole's initial attempt to get his client to plead guilty, something the later Rumpole would never do. Still, Leo McKern nails the part right out of the chute, which makes this episode a fine introduction to John Mortimer's beloved barrister.The ""special features"" on the DVD are mostly worthless, but the real reason you're buying this is to see an episode of Rumpole you've probably never seen before. That alone is worth the price."
2,Broke after very light usage.,The ceramic holding the light bulb just crumbled to pieces. I used it maybe three times for painting in the house.
1,Fried Air,Computer viruses are code. And this waste of paper would want to be a book on computer viruses without any viral code? You must be kidding me....
2,"Complicated, Confusing","This book as a lot of good information, but it is seems to be more difficult than it should be at times. The examples are based in x86 ASSEMBLER. So if you don't have a clue about x86 assembler, it's going to be difficult.The book does NOT show the code to infect programs, just what it looks like before the infection and after the infection. I understand why. If it included the code, it would be a manual about how to write viruses. Clearly, we don't need one of those. But, it does make the descriptions more obtuse than they would need to be if it just showed the code.There are several typos in the book, but most of them are easy to overcome.--My big complaint is the physical book itself. The binding is not good, and the pages are starting to come loose from the spine."
2,"Easy setup, but lag problem","I have my router for a month. It was working pretty good originally until recently, when I connected to the wireless network with this router to play online game (warcraft 3), it lag so badly - it won't happen when I use wire connection. Changed every setting but with no luck."
4,great for the money and prob. in general,"Totally does the job. Worked w/ more expensive routers in the past, but I don't have thaT MUCH EXPERIENCE. If I had to base it all on this one, I've got no problems to report."
5,Doing the job so far,I have been using the Belkin wireless router for about a week. It was very easy to setup. I inserted the disk into an XP desktop that is connected via an ethernet cord to the router and followed the onscreen directions. Setup took less than 10 minutes including security setup. I am using both an XP laptop and a windows 7 laptop on the router and both worked immediately with no quirks. I live in a 1000 square foot apartment and have excellent reception throughout my apartment. The router is on one end of the apartment and there is signal even on the far end of the apartment.
1,DO NOT BUY if you use Windows Vista!!!!,"I purchased this product because of the strong customer reviews and compact size. I did not realize that the easy install software is NOT compatible with Windows Vista so you are supposed to manually install rhe hardware and software. After having to flip through practically the entire user manual, you get to page 78, where it walks you through the manual installation instructions that are still not geared towards Vista. I ran the entire installation process and my computer still couldn't read the wireless router. This router is a completed waste of time and energy if you have Windows Vista. Do not BUY!"
3,Not really sure,"I'm sure this would work great, but it turned out not to be what I needed, so I have returned it for a refund. Sorry I can't be of more help."
5,good value for price,bought this router a month back. has been working well. it's good value for what I paid for. dont expect some out of the world coverage but works well for a 2-3 BR apt or small home.
4,WiFi Router Works Well.,The Belkin ME1004-R works well and delivers WiFi fairly effortlessly and easily. It was easy to setup and it continues to perform.
2,Streaming live radio music,"This product did not stream live internet radio music properly. Music would play for a few minutes. Stop. It would start again. And, keep repeating the same song over and over again. I thought it was the modem but in fact it was the wireless box. I called Belkin two times. The second time the technical person had me do a firmware update. This did not help. So, I gave up and sent the product back to Amazon. The return was easy. They even paid for the return shipping. And after, I bought a Cisco Linksys Wireless router product instead from Amazon. Now, I can listen to live internet radio again. And, actually my web pages load faster with the Cisco Linksys router instead of the Belkin router. I guess sometimes it is better to spend a little more and get a better product and better customer service too."
2,DNS Function Bug,"There is a bug in this router that does not allow you to override the DNS servers provided by your ISP. The function is there in set up; it just doesn't work. If you disable accepting the DNS from your ISP and enter your own primary backup DNS servers, it keeps the primary and secondary from your ISP and adds the primary you entered as a third, ignoring the secondary you entered. Tech support conceded that ""this is the way the function works."" 'Doesn't work' would be more accurate.If you like to use a DNS service like OpenDNS (something everyone should consider), skip this router."
3,This router doesn't like cordless phones.,"The router was easy to set up and works great, as long as we don't have a cordless phone plugged in. When the phone is plugged in you can hear interference when on the phone and the wireless connection drops. I have tried this with two phones and both have the issue. I assume it is because they are on the same frequency."
1,Stupid method for training a mule that you want to work for you,We have mules and are training them for a four up and packing. I would recommend you look at Jack Strode's Mule School before you buy this one.
5,Awesome!,"If you like Evanescence, you'll like Within Temptation. They just get better and better with each CD they put out! I'm already looking forward to the next one."
5,A must read for horse lovers,"Julie not only captures endurance riding and it's spirt, she captures what it is to have life time dreams, and never lose them. One of the top horsewomen to ever ride the trail, I think even those who have never ridden a horse, or desire to do so, would love this book. A great gift for any of the above too!"
2,Too abstract,"First, I have to confess that I had different expectations about this book (I thought it may be about other feelings too, but it's only about anger). The examples seemed poorly chosen for my 3-year old, who, for instance, does not really know what it means for somebody to make fun of him or why the teacher may unfairly berate him for talking in class. The idea of teaching kids that sometimes we cannot control the situation that angers us is good, but again, the example (I think one in which a favorite team loses a game) wasn't great. In general, the text was abstract and the illustration carried the burden of exemplifying what the text described...May be more appropriate for an older child."
2,Is it broken??,"Not sure.. screen is not easily seen, making it very difficult to see to play. Not at all how it's pictured. Thinking may be broken, will consider an exchange or possibly return."
2,Every genre seems to try this format...meh.,"This is one of those ""documentary"" ideas where zombies are real...and cognizant. The premise is so-so (coming from a big zombie fan) but tries to get a bit deep and feels like a lot of the script was stolen from Blair Witch. And like the ""Paranormal"" and ""Exorcism"" movies, you only need to watch the last ten minutes.I really wanted to like this, but it simply never seemed to get going."
1,Terrible zombie flick cheap,I cant believe they even made this ridiculous movie. It looks like they made it with a home camera. The acting is amateurish and the story is just plain silly. I doubt this movie sells too much.
1,$2.99 at Target or this??????,"Let's face it. All-Clad is expensive. It may last for 100 years but I would rather buy a set of 3 (different diameter) splash guards at Target for 'cheap'.I did not realize it, but All-Clad is now owned by Groupe SEB (the Societe d'Emboutissage de Bourgogne), the French-based cookware and domestic appliance business, so, how long this expensive line will be produced in the US is open to question."
1,Another racebaiter selling victimhood,"This book is a racebaiters paradise. Having lived in Los Angeles since the mid 60s, when I immigrated from Mexico, I've seen thousands of people, especially ethnic stidues professors(probably the most worthless degree achievable-let's see Ms Pulido try to get a job at Burger King)exploit race for their own benefit.Victimhood is the root of all the problems we have in Los Angeles. This book is just another way to expand it."
5,Informative!,"This is fine writing. I was especially struck by the opening and closing pages in which Mr. Adair looks at Mann's story and Viconti's film and contextualizes them within the world of the real Tadzio. Just what is it that makes ""Death in Venice"" so remarkable? What are those themes that shake the public and mesmerize gay (and straight) men? Mr. Adair is an adept writer and thinker. Take the time to read this small tome. You will be glad you did."
5,Most realistic driving simulation gamesever!,"I have only had the game for a little bit. But I know a little. You get to drive around like a real city. There are cops and all. There are stop lights too. If you get cought by a cop, you better run. Sometimes the cops are stupid. You can hide behind someones fence and the cops will lose you."
5,A true classic!,"This if my favorite installment in the Driver series. When i first put this game in the PSX and found out that the circle button was a special burnout button i was like ""oh yea, this is the best game ever!"". Yes the graphics are a little rough after playing Parallel Lines but it's still a true classic and always will be. One thing is for sure, and that is there will never bee a game with crazier cops. Try getting full felony, and getting good speed with cops a good ways behind you and slowdown really quick over the hump bridges in Miami. The cops just fly over you, its awesome. Great game. Still a favorite"
3,driving lessons,"Looking at some of the other reviews here that knock this game because of its difficulty makes me a bit mad. I found the game to be hard (the briefcase mission took me dozens of attempts) but this is what makes the game last - I still go back to it occasionally, looking for new ways to get the president home safe.Try getting to the gas station on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge, or getting back to the hideout in China Town, playing ""Survival"" if you want impossible.By 2003 standards this is basic on graphics, all the roads are straight-line and the game fairly linear, but it still holds its own against its modern counterparts, and can be fun, and a challenge. Bouncing around those steep ""Bullett"" streets in San Franscico, or trying to get to the Hospital on a rainy LA night can still get the pulse racing and the palms sweaty!"
1,Viva la revolution de Bill House!,"They did not translate the song titles correctly for this album. It is ""You're no better than a Common (Thief)"" ""Love ha(s) got its hold on me"" and ""At(l)anta."" I had no idea Bill House had a fan! Actually guys, Bill House is nothing more than a novelty. I found this record in my grandparent's attic. The back cover is Bill and his ""crew"" leaning on like a railing or something with Bill looking like Mike Myers in Wayne's World with a pathetic face that says ""Give Me a Break."" I listened to this album once and I regret it. It is pathetic, average ""music."""
1,awful,I bought 10 sticks of this to put in 3 systems. All worked fine for a while. 4 months ago the failures began. Now only 1 of the 10 is working. Buy any other brand - you can't do any worse.
2,Decent Carrying Case,"The Cokin case is a good way to carry up to 7 P size filters. I found the internal velcro strap cumbersome and it is a little difficult to find the filter I was looking for easily based on the design. I'd probably considered a hard side plastic case if I had to start over. Overall though, it's a nice case."
4,Pure funk !,"For anyone who matriculated during the 1970's, this album will bring it all back. It was recorded and produced during a time in R&B history when instrumentation and vocals really mattered. These songs and beats will keep your head and shoulders moving even if you are listening to it in a hospital bed ! Buy it, listen, and get down with the funk !!"
5,Excellent,I put this wiring harness on my 2005 Dodge Dakota club cab 2wd. This wiring harness works perfectly. It was absolutely simple to install. I spent maybe 45 minutes installing it. Most of the install time was spent trying to figure out how to run the wires to make it look nice. I'd recommend this to anyone.
5,"Good Book, my friends!","I am currently working on my business plan and have found this book extremely helpful. It's amzing how liberating and invigorating writing stuff down is. Once you start, you can't stop! It's an amazing chain of events that's just as creative as writing a song... AND FINISHING IT!"
3,eeehhh!,"It has alot of info and facts. But doesn't help you make any decisions. Read: ""The Maui CEO"" by John Tennant instead."
1,Seller BREEZE a rip off,"Was GROSSLY disappointed. Received D.O.A. broken stick, roots had been balled up in saran wrap, and were rotted. I am a SC Master Gardener, so I can revive most things from the dead. This is an exception. We call it the $50 trash bin decor. Seller Breeze was completely dismissive."
1,buyer beware,"This product simply did not function with my computer (Compaq Presario V2000 laptop), either with internal Bluetooth or the Microsoft dongle. In both cases, the Bluetooth software recognized the keyboard and the mouse as being wirelessly connected. But neither the keyboard or the mouse had any effect on my computer, despite thier ostensible communication. They were simply dead. So I now must go through the hassle and expense of returning this ballast (you do pay for shipping on returns)."
3,Great mouse occasional keyboard,The mouse works great but the keyboard has to be re-associated with the system every two hours. I did not use the included bluetooth adapter so that might improve the keyboard performance but if I wanted an adapter hanging out of the laptop I would not have paid a permium for bluetooth. The situation is tolerable because the laptop keyboard continues to work and years of software development on windows boxes has taught me to expect to reboot regularly.
4,Great keyboard and mouse and range...,"Works great, but not too different (all same--almost exact layout) from optical wireless; however, I do enjoy not having any wires or receivers showing. It's awesome...if it had programmable key sequences I'd have given it a 5 out of 5. A must buy if you have BT enabled, also..if you don't cause it comes with a toggle!"
1,The Dongle is Junk,"The Bluetooth Dongle that comes with the Keyboard and Mouse is absolutely a piece of Junk!! The slightest pressure on it in the wrong direction and it is history. Microsoft does not sell the a replacemtn dongle by itself. You have to buy the whole shebang!!!!! If you purchase the Keyboard, mouse and Dongle be prepared to by a version 2.0 dongle from another manufacturer for about $40. Good Luck"
4,Still works great after 10 years,"I've had this product for nearly 10 years or more, and it still works great. The only part I don't care for is, I frequently have to ""re-sync"" the mouse rather then it just re-syncing on it's own. Also, there is no ""power"" feature to turn off the mouse when not in use. other than those 2 things, this has been the perfect mouse for 10 years."
2,Hard Part To Find,"Nobody makes a 14"" rear wheel anymore. Glad this site had one. Being hard to find = high price. But had no choice......."
5,Seperate But Equal,"Separate But EqualThis should be required viewing for all introductory Political Science, Government or US history students. The Brown decision comes to life on screen, including the thoughts and postions of justices reluctant to overturn the Plessy desicion. Justices Frankfurter's and Reed's comments provided provacative fuel for intellectual debate in today's race charged society."
2,great for wrist ache,"cheap plastic, cheap design, cheap feel, cheap controller. Thispad is crappy, no matter what color you get. I returned it and tradedit for the madcatz one. The grip is too wide and the controller feels hollow. Get this one for you kids that like to chew on the controller or let your friends use this while you play them in a vs mode to have an advantage. The reason I gave it a 2 instead of a one is that it worked fairly well, all the buttons work. END"
1,NOT WORTH IT,"The product isnt worth your money, it says it cleans the lens but after use of product i am still having the same problems with my electronic."
4,Good for Pokemon cards,I bought these for my daughters pokemon cards and she was happy with the purchase. They felt sturdy and durable. Once sheet holds 18 cards (2 to each pocket). Shipped when stated so we're pleased with this purchase.
5,great cards for pokemon cards,I bought two sets for my son's Pokemon cards and I was happy with them. The quality is nice and it does not tear easily as my son takes the cards out and in all the time.
5,In Pokemon Heaven!,My grandson loves these! He counted the days until they arrived--thank goodness they arrived on time!--and immediately began inserting his Pokemon cards in them and placed them in his specially decorated binder. He is now the coolest kid in kindergarten. :-)
5,Just as expected,The pocket page protectors fit perfectly in all of my 3-ringed binders i use. Up to 4 cards fit in each pocket.
4,This is perfect,"My daughter collects Pokemon cards, and this is perfect for that purpose. Her Pokemon cards were all over the place, but now they are organized and in one place which makes me happy."
5,son loves it,I bought a this for a binder for my sons football cards last year for Christmas. He filled them up quickly so I had to buy another set. He can be rough with the pages but so far the pages have not torn.
2,Be Careful When Ordering,"Read carefully when you order these, which I unfortunately didn't. These are from the Ultra Pro Silver series which is of a much lesser quality than the Platinum series.For the price difference, stick with the Platinum."
2,Too Expensive,"DO NOT BUY!!! After I purchased thus item I found it at Target a whole lot cheaper. You get 35 for $4.99., half the price."
5,Love it,"I am using it for holding my coupons. After watching extreme couponing, I need more pockets to hold them all. They are also great for holding club cards and gift cards.Love it!!!"
4,Page protectors,"I ordered these for the purpose of organizing my coupons, these pages are nice; however I wish the pockets were a little larger to accomodate the larger coupons that I have."
2,Watch out the cable plastic,"The headset have good sound, and it is the only way i found to hear music while making sports with a regular holding in your ears, STILL, the continuing movements of the excercises will make you to keep placing the headphones in your ears once and again, wich is not confortable if you are trying to focus in your excecises rythm. Another big con, is that the plastic of the cable scratches so easily that you can just use it like for a month before it starts breaking down.Maybe if the manufacturer could design them with a better cable plastic cover they could be a plus, but as they are right now, i dont recommend them."
1,Painful!,"I bought these headphones to run with. They had good reviews. I hate them! They are incredibly uncomfortable. After only 10 min, my ears were so sore. I have very small ears, but did not expect them to be so incredibly painful."
2,Decent product. Mediocre amongst others in its price range.,"Sound is decent. Expect as much quality as you'd expect from bundle earpieces that come with (brand name) mp3 and CD players.Not the most comfortable headphones ever. Also, expect the neckband to hit your shirt's collar at all times.Definitely a regrettable purchase.Would've gotten 4 stars as a below $10.00 piece."
1,Terrible!,The rubbers fell off the ear pieces within a few days and i couldn't reapply them so that they would stay. The sound quality is so-so
1,flimsy,"These broke faster than any headphones I have ever used. I put them on, plugged into iphone, put in armband, pulled sleeve over armband and that was it. I have never had headphones break by pulling my short sleeve over it. I was not overly careful but was not rough. Did the same thing I always do. I was really looking forward to running this morning and that just ruined it."
4,Let's go running!,"I had a RIO MP3 player that had wrap around earphones that came stock with the player. I enjoyed those earphones as they were stable when I went running. They were a bit heavy and sound reproduction wasn't all that good. I ended up using my Sony in ear's that were like $100 after I broke my Rio headphones. The Sony in ear's sounded awesome but one default, they wouldn't stay in my ear as I ran. Then came Sennheiser PMX70, such a great deal for $20 online. I picked them up in a jiffy after having looked at prices at Best Buy and the Apple Store. I put them on and they felt oooh so light and comfortable. Music sounded descent, don't think they could ever match in ear as that's not the design but nevertheless sounded good and great for running. I would recommend these to any sports minded individual. They feel great and no hassle exercising with them on. You forget you even have them on."
4,Overall a good buy and good quality IMO,"I purchased the headphones for running, biking, and general activities after reading a few reviews. Personally I find that they fit me well (but I had to get used to the wrap around the neck feature) and securely even when I wear eyeglasses or sunglasses. They actually hold my plastic frame glasses in better over my ears when I have the headphones on. As for sound I would say they are average and not for the high end audiophile techie. There is also a bit of wind noise while you are moving which I attribute to the design and fit of the ear buds in your ear. Overall for the price range its tough to find another set which fits as well, work as well, are secure as these fit/feel, and seem as durable as the PMX70."
2,Owwwwchh. Not for small ears!,These are not adjustable in any way. The speaker part is so huge and the hook is too big to fit snugly over my ear to keep them in place. After about 20 minutes I was having to take them off they hurt so bad. I would return them if I could! Love the Nike Vapor white plastic ones. Very adjustable and lightweight.
1,Not a good fit!,"The sound was great with these headphones. However, the fit was horrible. They hurt my ears so much that I had to quite using them after trying them on three different occasions and return them."
4,"Feel Good, Sound Good, Stay in place",These are the best headphones I have purchased. The band goes around the head so it greatly reduces the amount of sweat that travels into your ears. They fit good in my ears and stay there when I am running and do not cause any pain. These are a good buy.
2,Still looking for that Perfect Pair,"I read a lot of forums raving about these headphones but I found they have the same problems of all the other headphones I have tried! the cord is WAY to long, the buds don't fit in my ears and they are not comfortable. Also the description says they come with a clip and they do not. I think if you are a guy these headphones are probably perfect but for me they just aren't what I am looking for."
2,"Nice headphones, but broke after 6 months","These are very nice headphones, that i used to ride my bicycle to work every day and to also jog. But after about three months the sleeve connecting the jack to the wire came undone (i glued it back) and after about 6 months, the phones stopped working because, I am assuming, a broken wire near the jack. I would not buy these again."
4,"Purchased 4 yrs ago, and still going strong","Just ran with these headphones that I purchased from Amazon 4 years ago. They are working just as they did then.I recently purchased some Bose in-ear headphones, and the quality of sound is great, of course, but there is no volume to them, and they do not stay in place when I run, so I switched back to these for my runs. They stay in place well, have good (not Bose-like) sound quality, and have some volume to them.While on a 4 mile run last night, didn't have to adjust the fit at all, nor did they get uncomfortable. Have worn for years, sweated much, and ran through rain/sprinklers, and have had no durability issues with being waterproof.Would recommend these for anyone who enjoys music on a run."
1,Horribly painful,"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't even make it to the road to test these out; as soon as I put them on my head, they hurt. Granted, my head is not the smallest, but it's also not huge, and literally the second I put the headphones on, I felt like my head was being squeezed at my ears. I bought the MX 75 twist to fit ear buds instead and those are perfect for running."
5,Great Product!,The product is just what I was looking for. I had ear buds previously and they would not stay in my ears when I was running. These headphones are not only comfortable but they stay in place and aren't cumbersome when running. I don't even feel them on the back of my head or neck like some of the other products I had over the years.
4,sennheiser headphones,these headphones are great. they are reliable. every other pair of headphones that i had bought in the past failed in short time like the nike phones that are similar to these ones. the only problem with these headphones is the chord. it doesn't lay flat and is too long and the chord is run off of one of the ears instead out the middle of the back like the nike ones. other than that they are the best sport ones yet.
1,Not built for running!,"I had high hopes for these headphones. I have tried many different models and thought these might fit the bill. First of all the materials are of poor quality. The screws that hold the bud portion of the headphone began to rust (too cheap to use stainless screws). Shortly after the rusting issue that sound quality deteriorated. I have never run in the rain with these, but like most people I sweat when I run. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone!"
2,Not Good For Running,"I've been using these headphones for two weeks now. I like to listen to music while jogging; typically no longer than 4 miles at a time. The headphones are comfortable (at first), they stay in place, and sound great, but they don't work out well if you're going to be sweating.My right ear will fill with sweat, creating a suction cup effect with the headphone, this is INCREDIBLY annoying. Its just the right ear, the only thing I can think of is that the cord coming out of the left headphone pulls that side down, allowing sweat to funnel out on that side, thusly pulling the right side up and not giving the sweat anywhere to go.I really wanted to like these headphones; they will jump to the top of the non-running headphone rotation, but just another pair in a long list that doesn't work out for jogging."
1,"great concept, but just too tight","I am training for a marathon and while I love the single cord design, the headset is not adjustble and after 30 minutes of running, the ear pieces have become unbearably painful. I have a relatively normal sized head for a man and have tried stretching the headpiece, but I have gotten to the point where i am going to have to try another set."
2,Hurts like the dickens,"I got these to exercise with and found the sound to be good. Not as good as my in-ear Shures, but good.The problem is that the fit is horrible. The sit in your ear at an angle that makes the front of my ear start to hurt within 5 minutes and the pressure inward from the headand is significant making the center of your ear hurt within 15 minutes.My head is not that large, but the at-rest width of these headphones is like 5 inches. They don't work for me. Thankfully, they were cheap."
3,"Started out great, then sweat seems to have ruined them - got them warrantied","I was very please for the first few weeks, then found myself turning up the volume more and more and getting less sound quality. Finally one ear quit working all together. I do sweat a lot when running, and I believe that is the cause, but I thought that's what these were for.Sennheiser had me send them in and sent me brand new ones. The replacements have lasted longer, but I know I'll break them with sweat after a few months.Prior to these I used $10 sony ones that lasted longer. The sound wasn't as good, but seeing as I've gone back to them..."
4,Best pair of running headphones,"These headphones are extremely comfortable and stay in place during runs. I am a little disappointed in the sound quality at higher levels, but my overall purpose was a headphone that did not move around."
1,Trash,Ive had this product for 45 days and have used it less then 10 times. The cable has a short already making music impossible to listen to. Not worth $4 let alone $40.
2,very painful,Unfortunately these headphones were very painful for me to wear --- within a half hour my right ear was killing me. The sound was decent and they looked good but they were just to painful to wear.
4,no hiding the headphones,"i got these headphones because i was sick of a breeze blowing out my earbuds. i wanted something that would stay on and stop annoying me on my long runs. well, the headphones stay on, but the sound is less than exciting. If they are perfectly placed, sometimes i get great bass but other times it is just a tinny little speaker in the direction of my ear.They do stay on, and they haven't drowned in my sweat like the original ipod buds. they can press a bit on the ears on the longer runs. I am not sure whether they are supposed to go over or under the ear like glasses. over they pinch, but under and I will look like dumbo yearning to launch.I also wish the plug was straight and not 90 degree angled, but oh well.Cliffs: they stay on, pinch a little, and don't sound great."
