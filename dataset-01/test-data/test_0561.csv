3,Good information for first timers,"The book is fairly informative for people who want an introductory guide to the Singapore Real estate markets. This is a good book to get you started on choosing a good investment. However, the fast pace of change in Singapore, with a lot of new properties coming into the market makes this book a bit outdated by the time it comes out. Also, additional details on the laws related to real estate dealing and financing options available would have been invaluable.Overall a good buy."
1,A waste of money,"In echoing what other reviewers have written, don't waste your money on Averatec products. I bought an Averatec notebook. Within a couple of weeks, two of the cheap keys popped off the keyboard. Returned the notebook for repair, even though it was ""supposably"" still under warranty, was a herculean feat. For several weeks I heard nothing, despite checking the Averatec website for updates on the repair status. When I finally called and got through to a human being, they told me they were ""holding"" it because the keyboard was not included in the year warranty! I had to pay over $100 for a NEW keyboard, and $85 to have the computer shipped back to me. The Better Business Bureau should be doing something about this company."
2,Where is the rest?,"Well for a computer book on web design that touts this great web site to get examples and download scripts, it would be nice if the site was kept up. Not worth the money, and I for one would never recommend the book to anyone."
3,"It was informational, but I think it was too expensive","It was a good informational book, but also a ripoff for forty dollars. If the book was lowered to about, maybe Ten to twenty dollars, i think it would increase the company sales, but it helped me alot to create my own webpage"
3,Is this a recordable book,"This title keeps showing up when I search for a record-able book, record a story book, and the like, but the description nor reviews ever mention anything about the recording quality, etc. Is is record-able or not Amazon?"
5,Such a sweet book,We received this as a gift and this has to be one of my favorite books. The pictures and quality of the book are fantastic for a board book.
4,I like it more than my toddler,"This book is enjoyable to read together if my son wants to read it. It is definitely not a book he chooses to read on his own. But when we do read it, he loves to point to the different body parts and act out the walking, running, etc. It's fun to read, and the pictures are adorable. I just wish he liked it more."
5,Simple and sweet,"This book is so simple and the pictures are darling. I bought it for our son after he was born, and I love reading it to him."
5,Delightful evening read for toddlers and preschoolers!,I love the short stories on this book! It is such a wonderful way to end the day reminding our little ones of how much we love them irrespective of the day we've had. For parents of toddlers in their terrible 2s and 3s there is a story in particular that reassures the child that no matter how misbehaved they've been we love them through and through!
5,"""Turn that crap OFF!! I'm not kidding, young man!!""","How many times did I hear that? This album, along with ""Truth"" by Jeff Beck and Cream's ""Wheels Of Fire"" define '68 for me. While I can't crank this up like I used to, it's still a great disc. Plus, of course, it sounds one heck of a lot better through Yamaha, AR, & Grado gear than it did through Magnavox or Sears Silvertone ""stereo"" in 1968!"
3,Not that easy!!!,"There is not enough explanation in this book for people new to origami. Too many arrows and not enough words! I don't have alot of experience with origami, but just enough to know that there are easier beginner books on the subject. Quick & Easy for the most part, not so!"
3,worse than previous editions,"Perhaps in an effort to clean up the design, the editors of this edition have dropped many of the terms of historical interest. I suspect that there are far fewer words covered in this edition than in mine (the fifth). I just had mine rebound, because I didn't want to get a newer one -- not because I couldn't afford it, but because the older editions are preferable."
4,Better than using the online version,"In my opinion blacks online (through west) is too cumbersome to use. too many redirects and long paragraphs. But this book is not essential either. You'll know the phrases you need after your first month or so, and all the legal libraries have a bunch of these all over the place. Bringing it to class is almost impossible because it's so big. But it is nice to have also. I would recommend this over the 8th edition because it's so much cheaper. I don't see much difference between the two. This will sit in my office throughout my career. However it's use will continue to be limited more and more."
4,It Helps,"I bought this book for a class I took while I was an undergrad, and I used this book almost as much as I used the text for the class. I was able to find almost everything I needed, and in the end, it was worth having. I would recommend this for anyone taking law classes, however, I would buy a used copy because new copies can be a little pricy."
3,Its was good,"It was pretty ok, i was looking for a book to focus on how to interpret a birth chart.. Specifically by putting the pieces (aspects, houses, planets) together to gain perspective into a natal chart. This book did have some of that but it also did have focus on the basics of astrology(planet meanings,definition, etc) which i fwlt was negligable as u can find this information anywhere.."
2,"The Rains Came, But A Good Story Didn't","The Rains Came is an early example of the disaster films popular in the 70s, and unfortunately, like those films, this movie is long on special effects and short on story. Myrna Loy plays a woman with a ""bad"" past who falls in love with an Indian doctor played by Tyrone Power. George Brent stars as one of Loy's former boyfriends, who has romantic problems with a young girl (Brenda Joyce) who basically wants to get out of her parents' home. In the midst of all this, an earthquake hits Ranchipur and causes a spectacular flood, perhaps the only really interesting thing that happens in the film. Loy and Brent look bored and give bland performances. Power manages to deliver a performance that has more life in it. The special effects are good during the flood, although it appears that they simply shook the camera to get the earthquake effect! The story is trite and the movie is poorly paced. This was a real disappointment to me."
2,Good book. Lousy Kindle edition,"Catlin's book is a great read, but the kindle edition is lousy!! It looks like it was scanned and NEVER PROOFED! Lot's of errors, page numbers showing up in the middle of a page. 30 minutes of proofing and correction would have made a huge difference in this book, but someone didn't bother!!"
1,Eviten esta edicióm.,"Sinceramente recomiendo evitar a toda costa esta edición, la traducción es malísima: llena de faltas de ortografías, incoherente y simplona."
4,Good movie,"I saw this movie quite some time ago and very happy that I am finally purchasing it because I had the pirate version before.See, a guy like me, pirate verions actually helps me buying new movies that that is also helpful for film production companies because after watching it, if I like it, I buy it for sure. If there were no pirate version, I would have never known this kinda movie.This one was surprisingly simple but fun to watch.The director made a very well made zombie movie called REC before so I would say I expected quite much watching this one.The movie was solid and well made.The charactors are all good but most of all my surprise was because the main actor didn't showed a lot of emotions through his face but I still could felt clearly.It's a thriller like 'Pacific Heights' kida movie. The difference is that a man who loves a woman decides to destroy her smile.Go buy it since it's no more playing in your theater.Worth every penny."
3,Jimmy Buffett- Coconut Telegraph,"Have to listen to this one a couple more times, then I'll review my review.Bit reserved about it at this stage as to whether I like it or not."
5,Updated Buffette Collection!,I purchased this CD to upodate my BUFFETT collection! I've played the ORIGINAL cassette tape so much it was beyond use.
4,Witty and Satiric,"Prof. Garber's book is an insider's look at the foibles of the academic profession. She has three main themes: the dichotomy between professionals and amateurs, discpiline envy (she uses Freud to great effect here!) and academic jargon vs. plain English.Each theme is buffeted with ample quotes from literature and contemporary cultural critics. Prof. Garber's strength is her ability to weave together disparate realms of academic life to poke fun at (in an admiring way) the academic profession with all of its growing pains and characteristic paradoxes (the dilettante as professional; the professional amateur etc...).On the whole, an interesting, fast-paced look into the strange world known as academia."
2,"high on description, low on rigour and organisation","This is not a book you can use to rigourously learn the fundamentals of image processing. It's a good reference book for the techniques, giving formulas and some hand waving to accompany them - little is motivated, ir doesn't flow, is more a compendium of techniques used in the field accompanied by some text just to make the formulas less dry : the format formula/paragraph is repeated throughout; everything is treated at the same level hence the disjointed structure that doesn't flow. Low on rigourous analysis; may be good as a collection of magazine articles but fails as a textbook on fundamentals - reading this book you'll know the how but it won't help you grasp the why."
4,Probing study,I found this to be an engaging look at fatherhood among blacks. His use of the interview technique works well although it did drag on for a bit too long. What emerges is a rather compact and considered portrayal of fatherhood in all its diversity and complexity. I would recommend this book highly.
5,Great Pop-Rock Disc,Terramara scores big with this debut CD. The 1st 3 songs are extremely catchy and well-written and many of the other 10 cuts are also excellent. Great vocals and edgy guitar make this a must buy for any pop rock aficionado.
2,Boring!,My son received this toy for his first birthday. He has absolutely no interest in it. The only thing you can do with it is stick the little animals on the balls. There are a bunch of nonsesical attachments that don't do a thing. When the big top is spun it plays one of two songs. He hasn't touched the thing in weeks.
5,very good quality,"my 3 and 5 year olds loved the cars. runs well, no problem with build and wheel function. will definitely recommend"
4,Crystal clear voice,I have another of her cds and found her voice to be so perfectly clear that I began to enjoy songs of others that I had previouly not cared much about. Her every song is like a great performance. I only rated this a 4 because of the song selections but her voice is a 5 all day long.
5,Sauer Etudes de Concert,This is not the first time I have exhorted people to buy and listen to Emil von Sauer's music. This is an extraordinary reading by Oleg Marshev as are all his other recordings in this series. Buy and enjoy.
4,Tab Folders,Exactly what I wanted. Delivered on time. Good value for the price. I like them a lot. Wish there was a package of 100.
4,Worth it for the remixes,"This luxuriously packaged Lou Reed compilation offers superb sound quality. His most commercially successful songs are here, from the earliest nuggets associated with the Velvet Underground like Waiting For The Man, Pale Blue Eyes & White Light White Heat to his early solo hits like Walk On The Wild Side and Perfect Day, plus some classic album tracks like Blue Mask and Legendary Hearts. Of course, besides a box set, no Reed compilation could ever be thorough enough as the fans all have their particular favorites, but the inclusion of the two remixes makes it an essential album for completists."
2,As good as advertised?,"From the praise on the back cover, I was expecting great things from this book, but I was very unimpressed. I was turned off by the politically correct nature of the stories and characters. All of the womenare all-powerful and all-knowing and able to out-perform all of the men, who are almost without exception weak, dumb, and brutal. The story of the backwards county where all the men are rapists was especially offensive.Overall, the book struck me as just plain stupid. This is the only work I've read of Mr. Chappell's , so perhaps this novel isn't indicative of the quality of his work. I hope so, since for all the praise I sure hope he can do abetter job than this"
3,It's kinda dark.,I collect TV show soundtracks and added this to my collection. The music is kinda dark and sometimes scary. But I had to have it anyway.
4,Cornier than the Corniest,"This has got to be one of the most silliest movies I have ever seen in my life!!! The gore is cool and when the zombies rode the horses in slow motion,I'll admit that was a little creepy lookin'. But, I must admit,that this is one of the best film to DVD transfers I have ever seen.Extreme crispness and great sound clarity.Add it to zombie DVD collection it's not so bad...I guess."
1,Not good,I thought I would like this product because I like rice and I like raisins but I ended up throwing it all away. Too much spice of some kind made it just nasty tasting.
5,Adventures You Shouldn't Have Missed,"Here's a sleeper from the 80s that shouldn't have been missed. This powerful, valiant album from this U.K./Irish sextet deserved a whole sea of love and attention for this spectacular effort. Of all the strong tracks on their sophomore album, all written by guitarist Pat Gribben, my favorites are ""Drowning in the Sea of Love,"" ""Broken Land,"" ""You Don't Have to Cry Anymore,"" ""When Your Heart Was Young"" and ""One Step From Heaven."" On ""Broken Land"" you can hear the Adventures blending sweet and soaring Celtic sounds to their majestic pop stylings long before the Corrs and that titanic French-Canadien songstress. If you're a fan of U2, Big Country, and even Savage Garden, you will be happy to have this CD."
4,Toasty,I bought these for my husband who hunts and fishes in the winter. These are great to use. Put in your pockets or shoes. Keeps you toasty.
5,Heatmax Hot Hands handwarmers,these heatmax hot hands work great really come in handy when going to your childs pracitice games and the real games. They really do last for a really long time.
2,Smaller than those sell locally,"The price is really low. After I received it I know why. It is only half the size of those I brought locally at sporting goods store, Looks like a lot of these heat pad online are smaller too. It's alright for me because the bigger one gets too hot, I had to keep it in jacket pocket until it cool off then transfer to somewhere closer to body. With these smaller not so hot pads, I can just put it in my shirt pocket close to body right the way. But it doesn't last as long, then again, by the time it cool off, I'll usually be indoor already and don't need it anymore. Next time I will be more careful to check for the size and cost."
1,"Hot hands should say ""cold hands""",You get what you pay for with this product (they were on sale for a reason). I have now used these skiing & fishing and both times were a big disappointment. I have a case if anyone wants them.
4,HANDY ITEM TO HAVE ON HAND......PARDON THE PUN,Hot Hands are great to keep in your pockets on chilly mornings or evenings. Also once worked well to relieve my stiff neck.
4,need these for work in a freezer,Work in a freezer 0 degree They work pretty good . Dont get as hot as i would like .Little on the expensive side . But they do the job
2,They dont get hot,"Got these for my wife as she is a banker that works near a large window and her hands get very cold.I bought these to try to alleviate that issue, but they dont even get hot... they just kinda get warm.Only buy these if you have one of those gloves made to put these in where they can be enclosed and build up heat. Otherwise they are pointless."
1,No so hot,"I received a box of these for Christmas last year and they are totally lame! They barely get warm and only last about an hour. Try the ""Grabber""brand if you're looking for some hand warmers."
4,Excellent product,This product has helped my pain decrease by approx 50 percent however I find I need to use roughly five packs in two days which makes it very expensive for me to use as regularly as I would like to .Perhaps a better deal could be worked out if a larger amount could be ordered but yes I would recomend people try this product .
3,Not as warm as i thought,Just received these.....by the way second package received from Lasership in last two weeks and they were delivered early. Anyway bought these for winter golf and outdoor sporting events. Advertises up to 158 degrees. Opened one pack and measured only 105 degrees. Only a little better than putting your hands under your shirt and against your body. Still better than doing that but will look around for a warmer product.
3,I'd buy again,"this product keeps my hands warm for the round of golf, easy to use, will use them all winter. good"
4,Good but takes a long time to arrive,"The product works however it does not heat evenly, i.e. sometimes it is very hot while other times it is mildly warm. The product also took a long time to arrive."
4,The His. Hers. Theirs. Series Begins!,"Lindsay Dewitt's mom is getting married...again. Then one day when put on the spot about whether or not she has a date Lindsay says yes and a name slips out..Daniel Newman. Public Enemy Number One, at least in Lindsay's opinion. So Lindsay begs Daniel to be her escort and he agrees for a favor. So while waiting for the BIG DAY to roll around Lindsay and Daniel slowly become friends and pretty soon they are falling for each other.Good Book. Make sure to read the other His. Hers. Theirs. too!"
2,Cantor's greatness lost in book,"There is little doubt that Eddie Cantor was among the towering giants of the 20th-century entertainment industry. It is difficult to imagine a book about Cantor being boring, but Goldman has done it. Goldman likes to engage in armchair psychology and seeks to apply it to Cantor, with little success. Although Goldman's thesis -- that Cantor created modern stardom by cross-selling himself in different media -- is interesting, Goldman fails to articulate or support what is undoubtedly a very defensible thesis. Instead, he becomes mired in largely meaningless details of Cantor's life and does not capture the enormous impact Cantor had on American society.The pictures in the book are poorly chosen, sometimes inaccurately described and abominably reproduced. Cantor's later life is given short shrift, and we get little sense of the poignancy of Cantor's final years."
5,You have to listen to,"this CD of Novastar. If you like Coldplay or Saybia, you have to listen to Novastar from Belgium. Great (emotional) pop songs like 'wrong' and 'the best is yet to come'. A must have."
2,"Not Even Good ""B"" Movies","The reviews and description did not accurately describe this collection. I like old horror movies and I really like ""B"" Horror movies. But these aren't even Good Old ""B"" Horror Movies.I am sure there are some that will enjoy these, but this is nothing what I thought I was getting. The cool and modern cover had me fooled."
1,dumb movie,this is the dumb movie. would not waste your money on it. should of paid more attention to the reviews. do not buy
4,NICE BOOK,"I bought this book for my 4 year old after my husband and I seperated and he seemed more confused after I read it to him than he was before. I think it's a very well written book but in my opinion for chidren say above 6 years old. For under 6 years I would recommend ""Two Homes""."
5,"Wonderful book,lots of help","This book was great! When we spoke to our son about the upcoming Divorce, he got upset this was one of the books we used to help him understand. WE read this book and he asked questions, told us how he felt, and then took it to school to help tell his friends. He also asked if he was allowed to let a friend borrow it, "" Cause he is hurting and needs to know it is not his fault too"". My whole family loves this book, It helped our son identify his feeling and know that they were Ok, that he was ""allowed"" to be upset, and that the divorce would become ""normal"" to him in the months to come."
3,Good for small children.,"My 9-year-old listened, said that was nice, and left the room. I think she has decided to let the adults work things out. When we let her down, she let's all know it. I would recommend the book, ""How to go to Visitation Without Throwing-Up"" for the next step."
2,Might work but terrible smell,"I was looking forward to using the Thera-Band Flexbar, but it has such a strong chemical smell after I unwrapped it that I stuck it inside a plastic bag while I figure out how to get rid of the strong odor. Judging from the strength of the smell, it may take a while."
4,Great product for tennis elbow,"The theraband flexbar works GREAT for tennis elbow. My only problem, was the instructions that came with it did not describe the exercise for tennis elbow, I had to look that up online. But a great device."
5,my pain is 90% gone,I purchased this item after reading about it in Reader's Digest. It took me several week to get around to ordering one. It would have saved me weeks of pain if I had acted quickly. I used the exercise I found online and I have devised more on my own. I can drive all day again. Thank you whoever came up with this idea.
3,Good but with limitations,"I tried the soft (red) bar somewhere for twisting motion and liked it but it was too soft for me. I purchased the meduim stiffness one and after trying it a few times for twisting motion I gave up using it. The twisting motion creates too much friction on palm of my hands and after a few minutes my skin starts burning. Now I only use it for flexing which works better without skin irritation. However, the flexing motion range is rather small and starts too easily and ends too hard. It is just a small range of motion that the resistance is just right. This is a problem with all spring-like devices as opposed to dead weight resistance. So, not a total loss but not as good as I thought it would be."
2,"Ok, not great","I believe it works, just has not fixed my elbow problem.Have been using exercise program for three weeks, not much better.I was expecting more and quicker results."
4,Seens to help with tennis elbow,I bought this for painrelief in the forearm. It seemed to work over time with use. I also have used it to reduce foot arch pain but still like the tennis ball better for that. Green might be a little stiff to work if you are on the weak side or if in pain. It will be harder to twist so you might want to start with the red.
2,Thera Flexbar,"It is too firm, the seller did not indicate how strong it is, not a good choice of product"
2,Was there a second printing?,"I don't think the egregious errors were ever corrected in this book.I've been an artisan bread baker for over 20 years. Following Julia Child (first home-oven ""steam contraption"", Bernard Clayton, James Beard and the incomparable Carol Fields. I became rather obsessed with hydration to the point that I brought American flour over to France to see what they could do with it. I have shelves of bread baking books and I found ""The Village Baker"" to be an embarrassment; full of inaccurate and incomplete recipes. To see it being recommended all these years later, dumbfounds me. Have the people recommending Ortiz' book really tried to create more than a few breads from the book?"
1,amazing book,"If you love bread, want to bake it yourself and need information, this is the book for you. History, recipes and all authentic!!"
4,A Superior Death by Nevada Barr,A very interesting novel. A lot of information about diving and interesting information about Lake Superior. Read it yourself to get full details.
5,Terrific suspense-laden fiction,"Nevada Barr has the knack for writing novels that are hard to put down. My wife bought me the first one, lost me until I finished it, and refuses to buy the rest. I have happily read up through and am currently reading Ill Wind.The books all have the same highly-developed characters, hard-hitting human interest, and just the right touch that only a great fiction writer can acheive. Add Nevada Barr to your favorite author list."
1,Not Good,This is a huge disappointment. There are so many errors like the first track. It says main title and first victim but this is not the first victim music at all. And you can barely hear the the melody in the music. If you want a better cd get the Jaws Anniversary collectors edition. It is well worth it.
5,Great Old Book,"Wonderfully photographed. Great ideas for creating jared foods that look great and taste good. Basic techniques are pictured step-by-step with useful sidebars describing things like what ""warmed suger"" is and why to use it."
5,It's almost scary how descriptive he is,"BJ Teller is at his comedic best when he writes of his zany family and their exploits on the Gulf Coast. Even if you're not from the area, you can feel the sluggish breeze as you sit on the pier at Perdido Point, and fish the afternoon away with his characters."
3,Parker-lite doesn't satisfy,"This novel simply puts Spenser in a slip. It's kind of sad when an old favorite does his best writing about the dog. Perhaps that's because Parker no longer bothers to put the effort into his now trademark ""clipped"" chapters. The plot is merely fair, the dialogue often is trite or a rehash of ""Spenser"" novels, and the ending is decidedly unsatisfying.And the book can literally be read in 3 or 4 hours, which is certainly not worth paying $25 for, or even half that price.Parker has become an assembly line hack - not as bad as Tom Clancy - but not for lack of trying.The lack of effort put into this book is blatant, unlike, say, a Tony Hillerman mystery, which can be read several times and always has more to say or reveal.Parker is over the hill - in dog years or people years, whichever measure is used. And his books are a reflection of that.The dog in the book does sound cute."
1,"Really terrible book, not suitable for text.","This is really a terrible book on system theory. It can never point out the essencial points of the theory. Rather, the auther uses a lot of mathematics to make the book a nightmare. One can never easily get the idea. There is nothing but matrices. Well, those matrix techniques are not so difficult in the viewpoint of mathematics,except, complicated sometimes.This one may be okay to look at when you are fairly familiar with the linear system theory but definitely it is not suitable for a textbook. Unfortunately, our school chose it as our text."
1,Disappointing!,"Not sure if there is a design flaw, but no matter how windy it is these chimes are barely audible. I chose these based on the good reviews, so I am a bit confused and very disappointed. Perhaps the larger ones work better."
1,windchime,I purchased; 2 of them. One for me. One for my mother. I;think they sound great. For the these price. I would recumend these.
5,Singing Chimes,The Woodstock Chimes are the best chimes that I have heard in quite some time. The tones produced are both comforting and soothing. The melodies can be hypnotic as well. Highly recommend this and I will be buying more and different types of the Woodstock Chimes.
4,Excelent Travel Mug,"Is almost perfert, the only think that could be improve is that can`t fix in any a car cup holder"
4,Techno Necessity,"This a great release from a great series. It contains the songs that everyone loves such as ""Sun is Shining"" and ""Better Off Alone"" and then it throws in some mad German Euro-trance to knock you down then make you dance! There are a few cheezy tracks but when you listen to 40 songs in a row, you are bound to not love every last one. If you like happy, dancey house, then buy Volume 5 and the rest of the series!"
4,super glue,"It is indeed super. Dries quickly. But, you need to gather all your broken things to fix at the same time because once you've opened a tube, it dries closed. If you try to overpower the tube, it will open at some unexpected spot and you'll be peeling super glue off your fingers for the next seven days."
3,"VERY, VERY NICE","It is a great thing to read a nice book for a change.this is a compilation of short ?? stories / tales ??set in an IRISH BROGUE kinda way.. Some are very good---others I was scratching my head. There is no swearing,sex, drugs or murders---sorry. Just a nice kinda read."
1,THREW IT IN THE TRASH,This CD is infected with DANGEROUS DRM malware/spyware that can ruin your computer!!! Stay away from this CD!!!
1,sorry but it's not la vida loca anymore!!!,"oh... my... god!!! I should have saved my money!! I liked the first single ""I don't care"" so I wanted the full album but... it's only crap!! No voice, no music, not even a touch of sex appeal in the songs.. Sorry Ricky but you should stop singing or doing things like THIS!!!!! One sure thing: la vida loca is not in Ricky Martin's hands anymore!!! Sorry!!!"
1,"Musically, a FLOP!","Truly a disappointment. I bought this album and listed it for sale on eBay that same day. It attempts many things and fails at all of them. The lyrics are cliche in most songs. Those that attempt to be ""adult""-oriented are not edgy enough to merit the vulgarity. The music is generic, at best. The arrangements are predictable. It only took me 1 hour to chart the chords of all 10 songs. The so-called Middle Eastern influences are gratuitous, as they have very little to do with the content or the mood of the songs. Overall -- a boring experience from start to finish. Robi Rosa's musical genius is sorely missed in this album. It has neither the poetically raunchy lyrics Robi is known for, nor the haunting and hypnotic backup vocal harmonies only Robi can come up with. If you want to hear Middle Eastern influences used intelligently, check out Mad Love by Robi Rosa. And although I care very little as a ""fan"" for Robi's songs, from a musical standpoint there is no comparison."
3,A bit weak!,I own many of Ricky Martin's CD and I was a little disappointed in this one. Its not as up beat as what I expected.
5,Ricky did it again!,"I would say ""welcome back Ricky"" but he never actually left. He took a much needed rest and the time to work on his music. His time away was well spent. The 2003 Spanish language CD ""Almas del silencio"" was very good and the first step in a new and more mature, but still fresh and fun direction, and this album is another big step. He wrote most of the songs and the fusion of sounds he collected from all over the world and made his own are stunning. I think that Ricky could do without the Rap collaborations and do just fine on his own, but he really enjoys and believes in collaborations, or as he calls it ""exchanging ideas"".This album has something for everyone. A few romantic ballads, many hot dance numbers, one little naughty song, and lots of fun and feel good vibe.My favorite songs are :...well I love them all!Get this album and you won't be sorry!"
2,Ricky should stay away from Hip-Hop!!,"This cd has great beats, but Ricky Martin's voice didn't go well with the Hip-Hop ones, especially on ""I Don't Care,"" and please don't get me started on the video for that song. However, I do have to give Ricky Martin credit for his creative expansion into other genre's of music! Other than that, the cd was alright!"
1,Ray,"This album really does suck. I bought the album last night and there are only two songs that I stand listening to in their entirety. That means that I paid about $6 each for two songs. I bought the CD because I saw Ricky on tv talking about the lyrics and the style and I became curious. After listening to the CD, I realized that the lyrics really are cliche. I was expecting SOME depth but there's none to be found. Honestly, some of the lyrics are so cliche and you could turn of the CD and play complete that line and your guess would probably be right!"
3,I chose this after reading the reviews...and am not so happy,"True, you can super strap your wiggly kid in with this thing. AND, it has more support straps than all of the other major products of this type out there.However, it's not padded and it's a pain to put on the cart compared to all of the other major products of this type out there.So, you'll need to chose: padded and convenient but not very secure OR secure but inconvenient and not as padded.I wish we would have chosen something else."
3,A good story but....,"it was not what I've been waiting for. and I hope that the other stories are better because I do think that Ms. Kurland is a good writer and I've ordered the earlier works and looking forward to read them.In ""My Heart stood Still"", I didn't like the heroine because it seemed like the man was doing everything possible for her but she was not even sure about her own feelings...or maybe I've missed it when I was reading.Anyway, this was well written so it's worth reading."
3,Hmmm ... anyone notice ...,Now did anyone notice how this is almost the EXACT same story line as Stardust of Yesterday?? Except the roles are switched and now the ghost is female! I mean come on .. how far do you have to reach!
2,Too long,"A hundred pages could have been snipped out and the story would have been a better read. It was easy to see why Iolanthe would be attracted to Thomas, afterall, she was a ghost and had never received any such attentions from a man before. But, I didn't really see why Thomas fell so quickly and completely in love with Iolanthe."
1,Seriously Outdated & Uninspiring,"""You've got to be kidding me"" is what I exclaimed when I received this book in the mail. I was shocked that it had a solid 5 stars from all of the reviewers as I think this book is very outdated. If you are interested in current fashion and beauty trends, this book is not for you. Although the copyright is 2001, it might as well be 1986 -- that's what the photos look like. Yes, the diagrams are somewhat helpful but if you are a lover of current fashion photography, you won't be inspired by any of the photographs to actually use the techniques. I found the photographs and the art direction of the photographs to be a bit cheesy and tacky."
3,Portfolio by Ketchum,"Beforehand the book promised a lot. 100 photos analyzed. However, it turned out that many shots are done in a very similar manner with mostly 3:1 or 4:1 light ratio. I can not see the uniqueness that the cover promises in lightning or styling. Still, the book is informative and it has a good layout. Some worthy ideas.Worth the money? Hmm... I would not say the Ketchum book is wasted money, but you can find some more versatile lighting instructions/manuals from the sites of lighting equipment manufacturers (e.g. Elinchrome/Joe Graig). It's definitely not a bad book, but not a jewelry in its class either. For an enthusiast - yes, sure."
4,Delightful,"I think this is a delightful little book. It is intended for a general audience and fairly accessible. I enjoyed learning more about such things as Japanese aesthetics, waka, Lady Murasaki, and kabuki."
5,Very Satisfied Customer- Ms Wy,I ordered this watch and received it in three days. It is just beautiful. It was packed well in the original box with 3 year guarantee. I also received a lovely t shirt advertising the company who sent it. I'd recommend them to anyone for an overall 5 star rating.
1,very disappointing,"Sadly I did not feel that this product lived up to the hype. Also had a trying experience with customer service; on both ends; amazon as well as chaz dean, two weeks of pass the buck. In the end it did not matter because the item will be going back. Considering that I like the cleansing conditioner, this was a huge disappointment for me."
1,woah,"This is an embarassing piece of work. The spelling is terrible. The grammar is horrendous. The poems make no sense at all, because they're often just a few words per line that don't make any sense together. Would you like to buy a verb? Very, very immature poems and what appear to be an attempt at serious poetry really reads as very silly and nonsensical.On the bright side, you can quickly get rid of telemarketers by reading just a few lines."
4,Need new antagonist,Second installment of Splinter Cell series. Has more character development but still quick interesting read. Should stop picking on Middle East countries and find another target to demonize...
2,"Technically flawed, not up to Clancy standards","Most of the earlier Clancy (and Clancy-endorsed) work has had good-to-excellent plot lines, and the technical details have been razor sharp. This characteristic has been lost with this book. They've got Sam Fisher being flown back and forth across the Pacific in an osprey (unrefueled range 500 miles, top speed 240 knots) - Huh??!! In one scene, a character described as having his hands cuffed behind his back picks up a cup of coffee and throws it against a wall. Not too probable. I guess Tom was too busy to give this one a read-thru before it went to the printer. Sad."
3,Careful - Maybe Too Small,"I bought this bag from the advertised specifications. Tamrac states: ""This ultra-sleek and compact backpack carries and protects a digital or film SLR (such as Canon's 20D or Nikon's D70s) with a lens attached, an additional lens, a small flash and accessories.""Bullhot!I have a Nikon D50 with a 35-80 lens and it does not fit in this backpack worth a darn. I had to remove all of the separators and still have very little room for a SB20 flash. I do not see how a additional lens will fit. However, this bags fits my Panasonic digital camcorder just fine - no accessories [lens/flash] needed with the camcorder.The quality of the pack is great, it just doesn't size up for digital SLR cameras. I would either look for something else or maybe the next size up in the Adventure 7 backpack."
3,"Yup, Too Small","I bought this for my digital Rebel XT. I really loved the way the camera sits in the padded camera-bag portion at the bottom of the backpack, but it was a bit snug placing my XT in there with an 18-125 lens attached.But the reason I returned it was that the non-camera compartment was too small to fit in my paperback book ""Field Guide to the Rebel XT"" (ie, manual). There was room enough for my mp3 player and cell phone, and a packed lunch, but not more. The dimensions didn't allow the book at all and so I returned it. That main compartment needs to be bigger to have more utility."
3,"fun, but not amazing","I love all things kitschy and vintage (1950s especially) but this book was a bit off the mark. The pictures and things were really cool but the captions didn't correspond (now I know what the other reviewers meant by this). One would think they would edit it a little better, it seemed kind of heaped-together. Still fun to peek at once in awhile or to have as a cool coffee table book, it's a part of my collection."
3,Typical flat screen scroller,This one is pretty typical scrolling jumping game. My kids like the cartoon and that makes it cool to them. You can grind and change from skateboard to rollerblades to foot on the move.
2,Little music from this one.,"We bought a larger one of the Woodstock chimes and absolutely love it so we thought we would try another one with a higher tone to harmonize. Didn't work that way. This one just doesn't sound. The breeze will make the alto one sound so lovely, and you can see this one blowing too...but no sound. Very disappointing. Should have left well enough alone. I may have to return it."
1,RUINED my vacuum bag.,"I bought these from my local vacuum repair and sales dealer. What a waste of money. Every single bag has ripped, just touching it to see if it was going to rip again - it ripped. Each bag has blown open at the seam, which is a huge problem since I didn't realize it and now the interior of my vacuum bag is covered in dog hair. Lovely. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this brand. Other people have had the same issues. Try the Eureka brand."
4,good deal,"good price, decent product, shipped right to the door. Just the thing for living way out here with vacuum cleaners"
1,Not worth it....,"I think this item is very overpriced for it's size. I am very disappointed in it. The description says it is 15+ inches long, that may be, but the actual tubes are very small and dinky."
1,A sham!,"This is the album that real Sonics fans should ignore. In a nutshell, Sonics frontman Gerry Roslie decided to have another kick at the can in 1980 and gathered together a bunch of no-names to form a band that were the Sonics in name only. The result? An album that we should pretend never happened."
1,shocked us,"I got this watch for my son in Jan 2012, by the beginning of Feb it was shocking him. I didn't believe him and wore the watch and sure enough, every 2-3 hours I received a shock from the watch, I would not recommend it to anyone. Not worth the price at all."
2,poor band quality,"the watch was fine, no problems, but the bracket that holds the band broke so it couldn't be fixed"
5,Cant Beat The Price !!,"I use this watch for the gym and has not let me down, I use it at the pool, steam room, and regular workouts at the gym. The watch does feel light and has a good size number display. So far its been holding up really good, no complaints from me. Great Purchase!"
4,timex 1440,I bought this watch for keeping track of time and the stop watch feature. The count down timer would have been perfect if it was easier to use. I would use my phone but I train clients at a gym and they think it looks unprofessional to use a phone. My phone features a count down that is easy to reset and goes back to the set time. The watch count down is difficult to set quickly. You have to hold a button and then set the hour min sec. That takes awhile without a clear button to reset. Also you have to wait for it to finish count down or re-enter the time. Would love to have an easy count down timer that goes back to the set time after it finishes.Stop watch is fine. Watch is small and light. Works. Decent price. Free shipping.
2,Flawed count down timmer. Timex Men's Digital Sport Watch T5H091,I returned it to Amazon. The count down timer feature does not reset to the original start time. You have to manually reset the count down timer every time. That will never work for me for my refereeing.
2,Waste of Money,"Baby Einstein Stage 1 - 7-PackBaby Einstein stage 1-7 videos slog along painfully slowly, and the simplistic, paper-cut-out characters make you wonder why you didn't just make some puppets and act things out for your baby instead. You would be much more engaging to more of your baby's senses! These DVD's are for people who will never personally engage their baby with age-appropriate toys, songs, flashcards and books. Baby Einstein is drivel! If your baby is alert, attentive and active, you will definitely slow them down with Baby Einstein. You can do waaaaaayyy better yourself with your own version of live animation as you act out songs and stories for your baby (and involve more of their senses than just a simple DVD)."
3,Big and Loud,They are big and loud. Also they look nice but the tone sucks. The Sypathetic harmonics are beautiful though. They were much less in sound quality than I had expected from Woodstock. I would advise to not purchase unless you have a return after hearing offer. Over all I was disappointed. I would have been willing to spend more if I had too. Buyer beware I guess. I would return for a store credit in a heartbeat and upgrade if I could. Thanks -Richard
5,A Gifted Storyteller,"Grigor gets to the heart of many questions asked by spiritual seekers. The answers revealed by the weaving of his story, and its characters, show to me that he knows that of which he writes.This is a fabulous story that leaves an imprint on my heart, with imagery and contemplation that comes to me while reading, and days after I finished the book. I am comforted by the tale, as it confirms things I have always believed to be true about karma and reincarnation.Dream Maker deserves much acclaim. I am looking forward to Grigor's next book!"
4,I liked it,"I would have preferred a bit more character development, but all in all I liked it a lot."
2,worked good but then died,i loved this mic... it worked great with my harmonica but then it quit working... is it supposed to be disposable?
3,pretty but not practical in the long run,I bought one of these and I love the look! But I've noticed as the day goes on the earring wants to fly off and they are difficult to find once they have. I've tried several times to snug it up but it just doesn't work well.
3,Cubic Zirconium Geezers,"This look into the negative state of race relations on council housing estates in London and its' environs at the end of the last century is told from the perspective of an inneffectual housing officer called Jamie who is the quintessence of someone on the outside looking in. Jamie tries, over the course of the novel, to relocate a Pakistani family who have been receiving racist threats while he also tries to cope with a recent breakup with a long term partner and a new-found fascination with a Chilean political refugee he meets through his Spanish instructor. Overall, this book is a vivid portrayal of the hardships suffered by working class minority families throughout Great Britain, and it offers amazing insight into the elasticity of personal race relations, as brilliantly illustrated by Jamie's fears that he cannot help a Pakistani family he cannot understand while being drawn ever closer to his Spanish tutor's ""stepdaughter,"" for the very same reasons."
4,A Blast from the past!!!,If you remember tetris as a little kid then you will still get the thrill of the stack....
5,Long time fan...,"I'm always late to the gaming community - I just now asked for and received a Nintendo Micro for Christmas. I had a hankering to get my hands on the classics, and Tetris was one I knew I had to have.I really don't understand why everyone is complaining about the 'world' backgrounds that fill the screen behind the blocks. It's really not that distracting from the game. There are options to toggle on or off, so if you don't want to see the piece outline, or don't want the option to save a piece for later, or see what piece is coming up, you can turn all that off. There are multiple levels and variations to the game play, so it should offer something for every player.Great game, exactly like I remember playing back in grade school."
3,Decent,"The game settings are reset every time you turn it off, so that's kind of a pain. Plus, the instructions are confusing for the other types of modes. It's a decent time-killer though."
1,how dare you name this tetris,"This Tetris is as different from the real tetris as snood is from Bust a Move, except Snood is fun... This game just does not feel like real tetris, it sucks!!!!!!!!!! Give me Tetris not this artificial weird thing. The pace is off, its way too forgiving, and multiplayer makes no sense and is so far from real tetris multiplayer... It's sad that the DS cant play original GB games because this Tetris cant hold a candle to Tetris DX. Unless you have a DS, get Tetris DX, and if you have a DS, wait for a new Tetris game and we'll see if it doesn't suck."
4,Kept my interest throughout the book.,"One Time is an excellent account of the life of a young African American on the LAPD force. Reading the book, you feel like you are on patrol with officer Bentley. You feel the rush of the chase of a dangerous suspect and the excitement of the arrest. But you also feel the pain of Bentley's disappointment of not being able to bring about the change in his community he was so desparately seeking when he joined the force eight years ago.The book would make a fascinating movie."
3,Beware - not traditional Step!,"Beware - this workout uses a ""high step"" and the traditional step platform can't really be used (and you can't just buy the little top platform part without buying all of the steps that go with it). I adore Cathe's ""traditional step"" interval workouts (Basic Step + Body Fusion, Low Impact Step and Basic Step + Cardio & Weights); her energy and enthusiasm make exercising fun and I can continue doing Step after all of the gyms have replaced it with Zumba. But this workout isn't the usual ""step"" - just lower body workout, some very brief cardio intervals and upper body/weights. I couldn't readily adapt it to a lower intensity for my arthritic knees. The constant switching among 1/2/4 steps, light/heavy weights, barbell and floor is really annoying. Fortunately, Amazon makes it easy to return something that doesn't work out."
4,Good pouch,"Nice, comfortable pouch. Clip is slightly stiff to get on and off, but the pouch is very comfortable and doesn't chafe when worn on belt, like many clip ons do."
1,Big disappointment. Never again.,The chair was dropped off outside my house with broken legs. The seller (Mintra Corporation) claims it will try(!) to arrange pick-up of damaged merchandize and a refund in one month(!!).Poor quality. Service even worse.Nadya ColumbusNew York
3,Old maids and widows: book club topic du jour,"This compilation of essays is at times very interesting and at other times just plain odd. Being a semi-single woman on the verge of marriage, I find anything about the study of singledom to be fascinating. It was interesting to me to see the various situations that led to the singledom of these women and in many instances the stories were humorous enough to keep me reading long past my bedtime. In a culture where being single is both frowned upon and secretly admired, I was not surprised to see those sentiments reflected in the essays. Most of the stories are written by women in their 40's that live on the West coast. They are either single by choice, divorce, or death. Some don't want to be single at all and that is just their lot in life. This would be a good women's book club selection as it is sure to provoke discussion."
4,Greek mythology,A not-too-hard to read book about ancient Greece with a new twist on the Atalanta story. A good read; good action; straightforward plot.
4,A very good resource for character research,"For anyone wanting a well-written, detailed work about the characters of this period, this is the book to begin with. It provides valuable information on the life of the times, the relationship among the children, and further, it furnishes a wealth of valuable detail for any actor or researcher. As a portrayer of historical characters, I found this book to be exciting to read. The only disapointment was that it ended too soon; right at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. Perhaps the author believes that this ground has been covered by others, but there is never enough material for an avid researcher to digest. So, read her next book, ""The Life of ElizabethI"""
4,Another great job by Alison Weir!,"I read about Henry's wives, and loved Weir's writing, so I bought this one. I really loved the way she set it up, beginning with young Edward inheriting the crown, and the whole backstory about his disdain for Catholicism, then Mary and her bloody period of putting ""heretics"" to death. The book was structured with Edward's short reign, Mary's reign and her marriage to Phillip, and it ends with Elizabeth ascending the throne. She is pretending to practice Catholicism to placate her half-sister. Her next book, the Life of Elizabeth I, will be my next purchase! Excellent read!"
3,Don't let this book turn you off from a study of this era!,"Though I am absolutely fascinated by this era of history, this marks the second Alison Weir book with which I have struggled. While readingHenry VIII: The King and His Court, my wife was reading The Six Wives of Henry VIII. Though I found neitherHenry VIIInorThe Children of Henry VIIIto be written in engaging styles, my wife greatly enjoyedThe Six Wives of Henry VIII.This is an incredibly important era of history for understanding our own era! InHenry VIII: The King and His Court), Ms. Weir has recommended one set of videos and an academy award winning film:*The Six Wives of Henry VIII) (1970)*A Man For All Seasons(1966)"
5,Another Fine Piece of Tudor History from Alison Weir,"Alison Weir has created another fine addition to her group of histories surrounding the Tudors. The Children of Henry VIII will fit quite nicely between the Wives of Henry VIII and The Life of Elizabeth. This particular volume covers the period from the death of Henry VIII to the beginning of the rule of Elizabeth. It is a wonderful period to study and read about as it covers the reigns of Edward and Mary and the almost reign of Jane Grey (not a child of Henry, of course, but a fine addition to this history). This tumultous period is seen through the eyes of the children themselves and the religion confusion occuring at this time is truly brought to life. Ms. Weir does no disservice to this rich tapestry she is given and in her usual readable and exiciting style brings all of this royal madness directly to the reader. A wonderfully entertaining read. I was sorry when it was over."
4,Henry VIII- First Dysfunctional Family?,"I've read almost every book about this Tudor King. This one gets into the moral background of the family and Henry really blew it. I suppose Elizabeth I, his daughter by Anne, second wife, must be the winner for her strenght and fortitude alone. However, it is sad because that is when the Tudor Dynasty ended. She bore no offspring and wasn't a boy. That meant everything then-and now! Interesting read. I'd recommend it just to find out who was the mother to whom. He did have 6 wives!"
5,How does this get missed?,"I agree with the other reviewers; all of which gave this CD a 5 star rating. The music is skillfully played and tender. The only thing that makes no sense is why it is no longer in print and so few are aware of Marie-Luise Hinrichs and these Soler sonatas. I am currently living in Moscow, Russia and hearing this CD while forced to stay indoors during a dark snowy short day brings light and warmth into the house. I doubt anyone would be disappointed with this disc."
4,Works,I installed this on my son's crickett with a cheap scope. Worked great for a while but nearly fell off after a day at the range. Make sure you use loctite and let it fully cure before going shooting.
4,Small but sounds nice,"Although this wind chime is small, it is a good quality windchime and has a nice, light tinkling sound."
3,Ok tip video!,This video had good tips on how to play the piano. But it didnt really show many techniques. Would like to have seen the instructor demonstrated techniques and how certain pieces should be played.
2,Disapointed,"My experience with Woodstock chime has been good, but this one arrived and quite promptly two strings broke. Well, I repaired it but I am sorry they arent as good as they used to be."
4,Relief for cold toes,"I'm cursed with cold toes at night and these toe warmers work very well to keep me warm. They adhere to socks without doing any damage to the socks, but I do find that they don't heat through thick socks as well as I'd like. Nevertheless I no longer wake up with freezing cold feet, so they do the job."
2,okay,I got these to help with arthritis pain in my right foot. I had used the hot hands during the winter to help combat the pain which helped immensely. Thought these would be helpful but were not really...
1,Useless product,I bought these for my ski trip.The hand warmers worked fine but the toe warmers did nothing at all.It is possible that the box I received may be defective but then I can only review what I used.I bought another company product at ski slope (as I had to) that worked perfectly fine.Dont buy these.
2,Effectiveness of Toastie Toes,"I selected Toastie Toes over Warmers because they were less expensive. They are not nearly as effective however. They are not as warm, nor do they last as long."
5,The best,"This is the best in everything. I have tried other toe warmers and HeatMax has the best heat, the longest heat and the best adhesive. I haven't found any negatives."
1,worst toe warmers ever.,i had some of the 6 hour warmers before and they would last about 5 hours. these say 8 hours and last 2.5 hours if your lucky I'm vary disappointed in them and will never buy them again.
3,they work but not thin/flat enough,"These do the job - they provide heat for a certain number of hours. However I find them not as flat and smooth as another brand I like better. When they're under your toes and squeezed into athletic shoes or boots, you want them thin and unnoticeable. These could be better."
5,relieves toe cramps,"I suffer from toe cramps and cold feet, and am a medical mystery to doctors so far. I keep the Toastie Toes with me at all times, and am thankful for this product. The warmth seems to help ease my pain. I keep a pair in my pocketbook, and a few pairs in my car, overnight bag, and desk at work. On a recent trip, it was the Toastie Toes item that saved the day. My toes kept cramping while I attempted to walk through the airport. After attaching the product to the bottom of my socks, I got some relief. The warmth often lasts longer than the advertised 6 hours. They're helpful when shoveling and surviving cold winters, but I need these all year round...just in case my toes start to cramp up."
1,frozen toes,"So far, one package out of 6 have worked at all. I ride all winter and like to feel my toes, but these miserable things can not be called warmers. Maybe if I was hiking, but for riding they suck"
2,Not so Toasti,"Have used them twice - Did produce a little bit of heat, but not much and not for long.On the plus side the adhesive works well, they do stay put.DobroDog"
4,Encouraging advice for struggling writers,"Next to public speaking, I hear students tell me most often how how difficult writing is for them. But it is not only students who struggle with writing. Often doctors, college professors, and CEO's have a hard time communicating clearly as well. This little gem of a book is for those who have practical hurdles that fall outside of the scope of grammar and style questions. The authors give good advice to start writing and especially worthwhile suggestions about focusing one's writing efforts. It is a small book and the short chapters make it quite easy to read. I would recommend this to any high school, college level writers. I am presenting some of these ideas in an English as a Foreign Language composition class for Japanese students. The book addresses more of the attitudes of the stalled, hesitant, or fearful writer and presents 29 mistakes with very good insights that other writing books overlook."
3,Nice but too small.,"The workmanship on this chain was nicely done but the diameter was too small. Suitable for a woman, but not a man."
2,Should be sold in pairs,The lights are good however I had to order 2 pack since each pack comes with only one bulb... and there is no advice or notification when you place the order.
4,Decent read - a little slow at times.,"This book is all about the biological happenings in the brain and how they affect your behavior. Through reading this book, you will learn to acknowledge your behaviors as results of biological happenings, and learn the basics of neuroscience. It is interesting yet at times quite dry. Basic psychology principles will help you in understanding the content."
1,Brain pudding not brain science,"Lame, lame, lame... this is not brain science it's brain pudding... Felt like a succession of Wired article of deep personal thoughts on all the new brain toys. Has no structure and brings no insight, how can this be a bestseller?"
4,A read more fascinating than you'd expect,"I bought this book because it sounded interesting, but I expected a bit of a barrier with scientific terms. But, I soon found I had nothing to worry about, as the author writes in common language, and when a big scary term is required, he explains it clearly so that the real challenge isn't understanding what is being said--but pondering it days after you read it. I had a lot of fun with this book, and actually use the things I learned in everyday life."
1,whaaaat???,"Hmm, i would say this guy isnt able to do anything, in germany he was an ""actor"" in a soap opera, and now he tries to be a real tough mc, but his songs are that bad, wooooow, i dont think you should hear that !!!! So dont buy this record!!! Thats my opinion!!!!"
4,"A Good Conclusion, If Not What I Wanted","""Running With the Demon"" and ""A Knight of the Word"" established characters that I cared for and hoped to read more about. While it was sad that my wish was met in the final installment of the series, I did like this book best out of the three. I got to see what became of many of the characters mentioned in ""Running"". Certainly, not all the endings were happy. This is something I've always loved about Terry Brooks writing: as in real life, the good guys don't always come out on top. Nonetheless, I was still very content with how things played out.There were some loose ends, and ends that I wished had been otherwise, even though they worked well with the story. Overall, I found this to be a satisfying read."
5,A must-read for Terry Brooks fans,"Angel Fire East is a great example of what a masterful storyteller Terry Brooks has become. I believe it to be one of his best. He does a great job creating the stage where most of this story takes place. Hopewell, Illinois is socked in with an ugly winter storm which just gets worse as the events unfold. Brooks always takes time to give the reader insight to what is going on in the heads of these characters which gives this novel a depth and impact which is satisfying. Read the other two first then enjoy this great conclusion. Let's hope there's more in the future!"
4,This first album shines!,"This is the first album released by the Gufs - a modern rock/pop band from Milwaukee, WI (Circa '89 was a later release of early songs). Just listening to these tracks gives you an insight into the songwriting and musical abilities of this little known band. ""Under Breath"" is one of my favorite songs of all time - from any band. The band may not be breaking new musical ground, but it is much better than the repetitive sound that is on the radio these days. Take a listen and I know you'll enjoy!"
3,There is a sequel.,"The ending of this book bothered my as is did some of the other reviewers. Somehow it should have been made more clear that a sequel was following. But by searching on Amazon I see that the sequel is ""The Lion of Venice"". Hope this helps."
1,Mediocre at Best,I was disappointed by the reviews above which proved misleading. Very little in this book is original. It reminds me of other romances I've read and the Perils of Pauline all rolled up in one. I found the story predictable and frustrating; the writing mediocre at best.
4,Great beginning informational reference book on these dogs,"This book goes into detail about the history of the Mountain Dogs as well as a complete overview of each of the four breeds within this classification. There is not the geneological references that you may find with other books, and I appreciated that fact as someone who just wanted to ""get to know the breed"" a bit better. The referece delineates the four breeds and compares each. It can be difficult to find information about the three lesser known Mountain Dogs, so for those looking for information about the Appenzeller, this is a great start.Included, also, is some basic puppy rearing information, including tips on house training, grooming, basic health and breeding.If you are interested in learning more about these teriffic dogs, but dont want to spent a fortune on a coffee table book, this is a great purchase!"
1,Awful... avoid,"Awful... should have known for the price. The hat fit me better than my son, and looks like it was manufactured in the dark with highly unskilled labor."
2,Don't bother,"Couldn't last past 1st chapter! Found it ditzy,, no real story. If a novel hasn't got me in during the first few pages, it's not worth it. This was one such novel. Unimpressed. Won't be searching out this authors work."
5,One of Keyes' finest!,How is it that Marian Keyes seems to know the events that happen in my life??? Rachel's Holiday sums up the experiences of Rachel in rehab as well as pre and post rehab life. A very serious subject made thouroughly enjoyable. Keyes once again surrounds our heroine with a lovely cast of characters that support her on her journey.
2,I Never Got Close to the Characters,"Rachel Walsh's family sends her to what she believes is an exclusive rehabilitation center, but it doesn't turn out to be the vacation she'd dreamed about.I think the most difficult thing about this book was the fact that I didn't care about any of the characters. Rachel, the drug-addicted twenty-something, was a mess. I pitied her, but I didn't care about her. Neither did I bond with any of the other patients in the treatment center. As much as Rachel claimed that her boyfriend Luke, was an amazing guy, he seemed very cold emotionally as well as sexually demanding. Her bff, possibly the only likeable person in the book, showed up rarely. The nun who was in charge of Rachel's rehabilitation was a bully. Because I couldn't get close to the characters, reading this was like watching a train wreck.What I did like was the portrayal of Rachel's struggle to come clean. I also liked how she tackled her denial.Overall, it was kind of meh."
2,Rachel's holiday is no treat,"I love Marian Keyes, however this was my least favorite book of hers. It was a long drawn out read. Not very entertaining. Sorry."
4,Good read,"Rachel Holiday , was far better story line , and characters than a lot of the other chick type lit I have been reading.Had a very deep message when it was all boiled down, but a good up beat ending.so will read more of this author too."
5,excellent,"Très bon livre, très vrai, superbement documenté. Decrit parfaitement ce qu'est l'addiction et le processus de guerison.j'ai adoré et je le recommande"
4,The best of the Walsh sisters,"""Rachel's Holiday"" was the third of Keyes' books that I have read, the other two being ""Watermelon"" and ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married."" I decided to read it after hearing Marian Keyes at a book reading. Although depression and addiction were threads in her other novels, this book presented the most profound picture of a woman with substance abuse. Keyes is masterful using of humor to deal with dark subjects (Rachel's first impression of The Cloisters). Her skilled use of flashbacks made me both empathetic and angry at Rachel's behavior. Although the ending was too Hollywood and less believable, I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys women's stories."
5,My favorite of Marian Keyes' books,"I've read three or four of Marian Keyes' books and while I've enjoyed them all, this one is my favorite by far. Which is strange because I thought I was not going to like it that much, since I am typically not into books about addictions/drugs/drinking. But Rachel and the other characters are so fleshed out and universally relatable, and the story is both funny and moving. If you're hesitating at all, give it a chance and I don't think you'll be disappointed. I couldn't put it down."
4,BODY GLOVE SCUBA MP3 SUIT,OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT DEAL FOR AN ON THE GO CASE FOR YOUR MP3 PLAYER. THE ONLY DOWN FALL IS THE ACCESS FOR YOUR EARBUG HEAD PHONES DOSEN'T ALLOW YOUR ADAPTER TO FIT IN ALL THE WAY. BUT ALL IN ALL IS A GEAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE.YOU SHOULD UPGRADE YOUR EARBUG HEAD PHONES.
4,Excellent learning book,"I took a ""haute couture"" class at FIT in NYC, after taking that class, this book proves to be very helpful and a great source of inspiration. It was helpful to learning new techniques and see the old techniques from a different point of view. I like it and recommend it."
3,A clarification from the author,"Potential buyers need to be aware that this volume is a reissue of my 1996 book ""Raptors: The Birds of Prey,"" which the publisher has released with a new title and cover art, but with no changes to the content. I am embarrassed to see that they have promoted it as though it was a new book; while I'm pleased the book is again in print, I believe they should have been more forthright in making clear that it is a reissue instead of an entirely new work -- Scott Weidensaul. (Ignore the star rating, please -- the review would not post without it.)"
5,You Don't Know What Your Missing,"This is the best Gospel CD I have purchased this year. Every song is amazing and the production is faultless. I knew it would be good when I hear the snippets, but I never imagined that it would be this great. As a young Christian breaking away from the main stream secular music with the themes of pimps, money, and loose chicks, and replacing it with inspirational music I find this to be refreshing to my ears giving all the Glory to God and still appealing with a contemporary sound. I would recommend this to anyone that is open to hearing positive and uplifting music. I would give a list of my favorites but I love the whole CD so go out and get it you will not regret it!"
5,Awesome stuff.,"I have mild depression and anxiety. I have been prescribed zoloft, wellbutrin, and cymbalta - only to be a poster child for the side effects of each of these (especially the cymbalta, horrible stuff!). I decided that I needed to at least try a natural remedy before I moved on to the next prescription. I read about Perika and decided to try it although I wasn't holding out too much hope. Boy, I was wrong. I know it says to take it a month before you see results but I noticed results within the first week of taking it. It is kind of a bummer to have to remember to take it 3x a day but it is so worth it. It is literally my ""happy pill"" with no side effects. And although I am terrible at remembering to take meds on time, I can easily remember to take the Perika because my mood starts to dip after about 5 hours from the last dose. If you have issues with depression and anxiety I would highly recommend trying Perika before subjecting your brain to the awful chemicals of prescription meds."
5,tzedd,"Being a ufo buff, this dvd is amazing. Don't expect actual ufo footage, but the graphics and genuine witness accounts are amazing. The initial story of Frederick Valentich is true. I remember seeing the story on the local news when it happened. GO FOR IT!!!"
5,Best Marmot,"We own four in this style, and find this to be a very lovable stuffed marmot. Very durable. However, they will throw parties when you go out and may drink all of your single-malt Scotch."
4,Book review,"This book was very through. It covered all aspects of engine rebuilding. It only covered American engine types, no imports. But most techniques will carry over. I still would like to find a book that specializes in euro engines."
2,"Good with Spanish documents, but otherwise disappointing","This is an interesting read and Roberts does a good job with presenting the myriad and complex Spanish documents on the topic. Sadly, he's limited by his lack of knowledge of the native cultures of the southwest. There are some hilarious passages where he's bemoaning the fact that modern-day Puebloans won't talk to him...yet his relationship with these people seems to consist entirely of his showing up and asking pointed questions. He also makes some glaring errors, as in his reference to Peyote ""mushrooms"" and his suggestions about the kiva at Abó."
4,Enjoyed this,"If you love stories, you'll really enjoy this. My students did. Also nice to add to your collection are: Aesop for Children (Winter), Grimm's complete fairy tales (Grimm), Great Children's stories (Richardson), The Butterfly (Singh). There are many other great children's books out there, but these were the ones I enjoyed the most. Oh, and I almost forgot the two classics that no children should ever be deprived of: The Little Prince (Exupery) and Charlotte's Web (White)."
4,"direct intuitive treatment but much ""left as an exercise""","This assumes some advanced calculus and then introduces enough Lebesgue integration amd measure theory to explain and prove the basic convergence results for (generalized) Fourier analysis. Second half of second year and above.Everything is very well motivated and the book is not long, but quite a lot is ""left as an exercise for the reader."" This really hurts the book for self study in my view. If you have a bigger book on real analysis and want another treatment, or need a refresher this will do nicely. On its own -- you've been warned."
3,Great sound... but......,"it rarely chimes... that is, unless there is a gale force wind. The sound is beautiful, and has wonderful rich tones that resonates long after the chime has been struck. My only complaint is the frequency of the ""chiming"". Light, even moderate winds barely get the clapper into motion, and unless its a very windy day, or before a storm (which you dont want to be outside anyhow) it rarely makes it voice heard."
4,WoodStock Tibetian Prayer Wind Chimes...,"I bought this chime set and have enjoyed it greatly! As a result of my enjoyment, I've also given several WoodStock chime sets to friends and family to share the joy. The reason I rate 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because this particular chime set requires a heavier breeze than the others to get it to chime but I have no regrets and recommend it highly."
1,Worthless,"I purchased this drive just 13 months ago as a backup for my primary drive and to store my digital pics and video. Now all of a sudden, it just dies and disappears from my system! I went through all of the troubleshooting steps and finally ran the PowerMax utility from Maxtor only to find out, ""Your drive is failing."" Yep, I think I figured that one out without even having to run the utility. Of course, it's just a month out of warranty so Maxtor won't even touch it. How aggravating! Worst and saddest of all, it was supposedly my backup drive in case my primary drive failed. I had thousands of pics of my one year old, my documents, and the backup file on it! I WILL NEVER BUY another Maxtor product, and you should stay away, too! Somehow I feel Maxtor's 1% failure rate claim is bogus!"
2,"a little less fat, but alot less rewarding","The low-fat craze that was the rage in the 1980s and 1990s is continuing to wane, due in part to the increasing obesity and the realization that ""low fat"" doesn't necessarily mean ""more healthy."" This complete cooking light cookbook has recipies that, by and large, result in less flavorful and less ""competent"" cooking, with (in my opinion, at least) minimal ""health"" advantages vis-a-vis any reasonable cooking practices. Take the chicken pot pie recipie in this book, for example. Following this recipe results in a bland, very watery mess -- toped with hardened chunks of crust made with flower and butter. Neither the filling, nor the crust, will leave you satisfied. (Don't they test the recipes?) Anyway, I gave it two stars for some low fat desserts that were not terrible. A quick look through the Amazon.com collection of cookbooks will result in many better alternatives."
4,A winner,"Everything I've made from this cookbook has turned out well. Even the cheesecake that I used the blender on (not the food processer, resulting in cottage cheese lumps throughout) tasted good! I am a relatively inexperienced cook and frequently run low on time, but thankfully this cookbook has plenty of easy recipes that require just a few ingredients (I love the Crock Pot chili recipe).In addition to this book, I own several other Cooking Light cookbooks and adore them all. This one covers the basics well and is great for someone who doesn't want (or have the opportunity) to spend their life looking for hard-to-locate ingredients, mixing or chopping. Yay!!!!"
2,Worlds of Disapointment,Caveat emptor! Over ninety percent of the cover art images reproduced in this book are the size of bubble gum trading cards. I was under the impression that the images were all full page but no such luck. Once again quality is sacrificed for cheapness.
2,Zoe Trilling has big Juggs,"If you like big juggs, there is this fine woman on here named Zoe Trilling. I haven't been able to find any other movies with her in it but that is really the only reason to purchase this video. Other than that, it's not really that good. The plot stinks and there is no action."
2,Presenting...The End,"Welcome to the ADD format. The ""episodes"" are about three minutes long; two per download. Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over. Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row. An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format."
5,Beautiful Sound and Workmanship,We gave a set of these chimes to our daughter and son-in-law for their anniversary. The sound of the chimes is so mellow and the workmanship is outstanding. Our kids will enjoy their gift for many years to come.
2,not what i needed,"This is NOT the same as the solutions manual for instructors. This version only has ~every 4th problem solved. If you need the solutions for all the problems, this book is less than 25% of what you're looking for."
3,Solutions Manual for Students to Accompany Physics for Scien,"this book is good, help student to solve the problem on the text book."
3,There's plenty in there,"This was the first book I read in the Walsh family series but I recommend reading 'Watermelon' and 'Rachel's Holiday' beforehand. Both these books (about Anna's big sisters, Claire and Rachel respectively) give the reader a good sense of how Anna is perceived by others - a little kooky but kind, new-age hippie and zoned out most of the time.After that 'Anybody out there?' gives you an insight into how the supposedly zoned-out alien being sees herself and the world around her. It is quite heartening to know that she isn't exactly stupid, just has a different set of priorities from most other people. Through most of the first half I had no clue what her situation was about but was carried along in the pleasantly deceptive/self-protective world Anna creates around her. Even as reality sets in, how Anna deals with her personal crisis is the heart-warming story of 'Anybody out there?'"
2,A bit disappointed,"Read this one in a couple of days and it is fairly entertaining, a good mix of funny/sad, but I wholeheartedly agree with reviewer ""Jennifer L. Tilden ""Bridget Jones, Esq"". Not being a big fan of typical chick lit but still a Walsh Family fan (Rachel's Holiday is fantastic) I have looked forward to Anna's Book for a long time, but the Anna in Anybody Out There? would have been better of as a Sushi-girl. Of course people change but there is a difference between growing up and between completely deny everything about ones youth.But, being an optimist, maybe Helen's Book will be more true to the previous ones and not to far fetched. And I hope to never have to read about people obsessing over lipsticks and make-up ever again."
5,Do NOT skip to the end!!!,"I am addicted to reading the last page of a book before I'm supposed to (I guess so I can see where the book is going.) DO NOT DO IT!! It will totally ruin the book for you. Despite my curiosity, I loved the book. I had tears throughout the book and broke out into total sobbing by the end. I love the Walsh sisters and I'm sad there's only one sister left :("
1,Boring,"Usually love MArian Keyes books and I preordered this book, what a hugh mistake. Boring and repeative. Purchase her other books but please pass on this one."
5,great book!!!,"this is a book with unusual depth to it. if you have read marian keyes before, you will expect a humorous read and might be surprised by this one. it certainly seems some of the reviewers before me were.but like in all of her books, this one has characters you will just become obsessed with and a fantastic story line. yes this one is a bit dark but you will want to finish it as soon as you read the first chapter. it is different but great. great writer!"
3,Crying too much and searching for life after death,I like most of Marian Keyes books first of all because they are funny. This one was not like others. There were some funny spots but mostly it was about grief when someone dies too early and the heroine was hoping that he survived somehow if not in physical form and searching for contact. She's being cheated and used by all kinds of psychics and mediums. There was also another completely improbable storyline of her private investigator sister's involvement with mafia which (storyline) was trying too hard to be funny but was in reality just a set of stereotypes. I was a little disappointed. If you like to cry a lot you might enjoy it though.
5,Great read!,"I loved this book. It was sad, funny, engaging, and interesting all in one. The story begins with Anna at home and seriously injured. You don't find out why until halfway through the book. As the story unfolds, you find yourself having a harder and harder time putting it down. (Even when you need to get up early the next day for work!) I am a big Marian Keyes books, which started with Watermelon. This one may even top Watermelon as my favorite. I can't WAIT until a book about Helen comes out.Definitely read this book!"
5,One of their best,"I have listened to most of their music and find myself listening to this particular work more than any of the others. It has grown on me in a big way to the point where I will listen to it three times in a row just to absorb the creative songwriting, beautiful melodies, and psychedelic take on life in new and unexpected ways. Highly recommended."
1,Customer service???,"I bought this LG french door refrigerator with the freezer in the bottom and ice maker in the door. Was a real nice refrigerator at first. There is a nut on the back of the ice maker bin that keeps coming off. I just put it back on so many times...finally I had enough and I called LG. They politely said ""I am sorry that has happened. You need to buy a new Ice Bin. Here is a phone number to call for someone who will sell it to you."" Wow, thanks so much. 7 year warranty she tells me but not on that part, surprise. Looks like I am on my own. $150 later, thank you LG. I would not recommend LG for your big ticket items. If you spend your hard earned cash on an expensive appliance you need a company that will stand behind their product. LG is not that company."
4,Thanks Bomp,"Since most of these artist's LP's are out of print, it's nice to have a least one song by all these great overlooked bands. It's a shame that only big record company bands/artists are allowed to be heard on radio. If half these Bomp bands/artists had the big budgets behind them to promote them and keep them working and fed, we would have a ton of classic records flooding our record stores. To bad Greg Shaw (founder of Bomp) wasn't a very rich eccentric with and endless stream of cash to keep Bomp artist in the forefront of popular music. I'd much rather hear The Things and Miracle Workers new records every year (if they were able to afford to keep recording I'm sure there would be new releases from them ) than have to deal with new boring trends and lame bands to go with these boring trends every few years. The Things 'Everytime' still makes me wish they were still around making records. A GREAT band on a great compilation. Thanks Bomp!!"
5,Fabulous So Far.,"I'm at the end of my first discrete mathematics course and have struggled to find clear explainations of how to write a proof, meaning how to choose what method and how to choose what the next statement should be to lead to the desired conclusion. I'm only on chapter five and it is a breath of fresh air to read this. Rather than just showing the completed proof Eccles shows the ""scratch"" work that goes into making the proof, discusses the reasoning and alternative paths, and then has the final proof that is easily understood.An excellent supplement for a typical college text."
5,Very interesting narrative from a great writer,"I recently saw the original Jail Journal on display in Eugene, Oregon at an art museum. It was filled with excellent illustrations (very 60s, of course) and some wonderful diary entries by Kesey (who really has a way with words). I had a great time reading the pages, which were arranged on the walls in order, and am going to be pruchasing this book so I can have a version at home to look at in the future."
5,ITS ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING!,"If you have EVER rode a motorcycle , wore a leather jacket ,carried a knife, or was of the opinion that the highway was like one long endless adventure .THIS IS THE FILM TO OWN , CHERISH , AND SHARE in all its soap opera like glory!Classic lines delivered by the master Willem Defoe !"
3,more variety,"I really like these wind chimes, all except for the cat. I wish there were other options for the charm. If there had been, I would have bought it."
2,waste of money,this book was a disapointment. it was very basic and did not help much. i wish it would have more examples
5,Excellent,"One of those rare historical books which I was sorry to see end, Team of Rivals showcases Lincoln and his eventual cabinet in the years in which the Republican party was formed and overcame the Democrats in the election of 1860, and through the Civil War, culminating in the tragedy of Lincoln's assassination. Goodwin does show Lincoln as the 'political genius' of the subtitle in his dealings with both the radicals and conservatives at almost cross purposes during the war between the States; his ability to focus on his objectives of preserving the Union and abolishing slavery and maintaining a strong moral character throughout seem almost super human."
2,Second Rate.,"While good on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Gettysburg Address, this book is not in the league of McCullough, Caro, or Chenow works. Too much she is trying to control. Do we need to know how much Kate Chase, a trivial historical figure at best, spends on interior decorating?If the author took a character like Kate Chase and inserted her in an isolated subchapter, it might have been nice. But she pops up all over the book. One way the author kills narrative drive."
4,I like it,"I'm used to reading murder mysteries, so this is more difficult to read. But it is fascinating. It feels like watching history from street level rather than up at 30,000 feet."
5,Interesting book,"Haven't finished it yet but it is a very interesting read. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen the movie ""Lincoln"""
5,"When the facts are known, the author has to be special","Lincoln's life is well known, general observations about his Cabinet are usually short and focus on the conflicts. Doris Kerns Goodwin's book gives new, detailed insite on how Lincoln managed the conflicts to suit his objectives. This book is a particularly good read for any manager of any large group of people."
5,Well written book that is not always true.,"I read several books about Lincoln and then turned to reading this thick, well written and researched book concerning Lincoln and several of his life long friends, with the understanding that Obama had read the book and was using it as an outline for his office. It was interesting to see what he did and why he did it; how he made decisions, his personal decisions, and stuck with them. When ever he followed the dictates of his cabinet or other opinions, different than his own, he got into trouble. Lincoln needed to listen to his own council. It was sad to learn that Lincoln was the sole cause of the Civil War and all the money and lives it cost. He was not assassinated soon enough. His unconstitutional beliefs in the connection of the the States to that of the Union caused much trouble for everyone."
4,Enjoyable read,Very easy to read and good book for those who are visual readers. I will going forward view Lincoln and his rivals in a more thoughtful and educated way. Good read.
2,Not Much New Here,"Lincoln is, as always, fascinating. Seward, Chase, and particularly Stanton are figures well worth the study. Unfortunately, the book reads like a summary of what a bunch of other people said about these men. Kearns Goodwin has nothing new to say whatsoever, as far as I could make out. Not a waste of the reader's time, especially if you just want an introduction to Lincoln and his contemporaries. But to those looking for a good Lincoln bio, check out David Herbert Donald's Lincoln. Much ado about nothing. One of the most overrated books of the year."
2,Bogsville,"This book gets bogged down with insignificant facts about insignificant people and redundancy about the significant ones. The author could have finished this book in half the amount of pages. It's a pretty tough read if you prefer a more streamlined approach to history e.g., Joseph Ellis's books. You've got to really plough through it to read it all. It does have some interesting material in it but it's a really slow read."
1,A lengthy book report,"It is highly unfortunate that best-selling historical writing has basically become long book reports.Kearns Goodwin uncovers nothing new in this book on Lincoln and his key cabinent members. What the reader receives is Kearns Goodwin's editing and repackaging of many resources, comparable with a college composition, only longer.Save your money and try to find down Gore Vidal's outstanding history/fiction book, Lincoln. One will learn and appreciate so much more the life and times of arguably the greatest president at a paperback price."
1,Very Disappointed,"This book, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln was to be a Christmas present. It arrived with the jacket torn in one spot and upon opening the book, the entire left side of the jacket had a crease in it. It is permanent."
5,Closer to Lincoln than ever before,"As an enthusiastic consumer of presidential biographies I can without hesitation say this is the best I've read. Goodwin presents Lincoln in all his glory and vulnerability. The Civil War is followed without the usual complexities of the battleground, yet without detriment to the sacrifices made there. One comes to accept how very crucial it was that a man of Lincoln's caliber came on the scene when he did. The parallels between those days and today are unmistakable. The death of this great man, as told by the author, seems as stunning and heartbreaking in the reading as it must have been that fateful day. One wants to shake Goodwin's hand, or at the very least write a review filled with these sincere sentiments."
4,Goodwin's Take,"In general this is a splendid piece of work, largely because it embraces and integrates a huge amount of material, and gives the reader a fuller sense of the political terrain prior to Lincoln's election. Goodwin provides intriguing accounts of the lives, personalities, and political careers of the most important figures in the landscape around Lincoln and fleshes it all out in many details. If I had one qualm, it is that as I proceeded through this massive book, I became a bit impatient with Goodwin's occasional tendency to simplify, even caricature a few historical figures, especially when they are pitted against Lincoln, about whom she is reluctant to say a negative word. While the book is solidly grounded in research, at times it inclines toward hagiography. Since Lincoln's tortuous journey to greatness speaks for itself, there is no need to exaggerate it or protect him from his lesser characteristics, of which he was only too well aware."
1,Great book but Kindle sucks,It did not download to my Kindle. So I never got to read it. I will not try again and probably will scrap the Kindle.
5,Must Read!,"Well written and researched. I didn't like history in school but am very interested in it now, especially the way our country has deteriorated. Its good to see what was done in the past and hopefully don't repeat mistakes. I have even more respect for Lincoln and admire what a great mind he was. Wish we could have him back today!"
5,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,"Wonderfully written, easy to digest, filled with solid research.I'm a Social Studies teacher and here is a book that gave me additional insights into Lincoln. I have suggested this read to fellow teachers and other American History buffs."
5,Excellent,"I wanted to read this after seeing the movie ""Lincoln"". It was very well written and had information I never knew. I recommend it highly."
5,GREAT READ!!,"I am totally enjoying this book. Doris Goodwin writes a story, not just the dry history of the era. It isn't just Lincoln who is fascinating but all of the gentlemen who worked with him."
5,A transcedent learing expeirence,"Very good! Mrs. Goodwin is one of the best researchers and writers around and it really shows in this book. This book was not just a historical biography for me, it was also a total experience which made me unable to put it down. She brings to life Lincoln's emotions and sets the table for all of the drama that constantly unfolds in his life. Kearns involves the most important people in Lincoln's life and seamlessly adds their impact on our 16th president's story. If there is a fault with Kearns it is she tends to not mention her subjects faults but with Lincoln, he does not have many so it really works and you get you a riveting read. I cannot wait to see the movie that's screenplay is based off of this book. Terrific. Go rush out and buy it."
5,Team of Rivals,So far this one of the best books I've ever read. I am looking forward to reading some of her other books.
5,Great Service!,I received my book in a very timely manner. There was OBVIOUS care taken in packaging and delivering my book. I loved it!
5,Fantastic,"Can't say enough about this book. The first hundred pages or so are tough to get through which set the backstory of the Rivals, but once you get into it, you can't put it down! Highly recommend!"
3,Good but not great,"Ms. Goodwin has done a great deal of research in writing this book, you can tell because the footnotes stretch for over 100 pages. The problem is that she seems to want to share all of it with us.Too much of this book covers aspects that have no real conection to the interaction of Lincoln with his cabinet. Do we really need to know the spending habits of Mary when they never seemed to have an inpact on her husband?If you don't mind spending some time on irrelevant details, such as what the daughters where to their fathers' parties the book does give a great perspective on Lincoln."
4,very good history book,"I found this book very good becouse of the facts of history. I did find it hard to read due to the early English language, but I had trouble putting it down. I did see the move ""Lincoln"" during the reading of the book and found it more enjoyable."
5,You grow to really understand Lincoln,"Extremely well written. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a compelling story teller, and you are drawn in to the world of Lincoln. She obviously has a lot of affection for your subject, and, because of the book, you start to as well. Even though you KNOW how the story will end (if you paid any attention to your middle school American History class), it's still saddening, because your understanding of this great President has grown so much. Loved it."
4,Great for quick trimming when you don't want to get the chainsaw out,This is the second saw that i have bought. First was bought locally for a relative. Now i have my own that I've used to clear the bottom 6' of a row of pines without dulling or damaging the saw teeth. The curved blade makes cutting quite a bit faster than a straight edge.
3,Not Chainsaw Style Teeth,"I bought this saw assuming it had the chain saw style teeth, but it does not, it has the razor style teeth, which are fine, but it is not the chain saw style, which is impossible to find in anything other than the long handled limb pruners. Also, the product details section are wrong, this is an 18"" D-Handled saw, not the 10"" one that is states, just to clarify. But, overall, it is a nice razor style saw."
3,Subpar Entry,"Rosenfelt's first three books in the Andy Carpenter series were tightly written capers with lots of humor sprinkled in, and a minimum of overtly obvious suspects and plot twists. I can't say the same for Sudden Death. The red herrings are obvious, as are the suspected culprits. This would have been okay if Mr. Rosenfelt had kept the book as tightly written as the others, but the narrative went on for too long as Carpenter repeatedly went through a litany of thoughts regarding the possiblility of his significant other moving away from him, and his fears of being killed by a noted drug dealer. The humor that was so abundant in the other books in this series is also not as evident, and the text could have used more to compensate for the psychobabble.Enjoyable, but not as much as the others."
5,A WELL WRITTEN READ WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR EVERYONE!,"MONEY DRIVEN MEDICINE BY MAGGIE MAHAR IS AN EXCELLENT READ AND PROVIDED ME WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH CARE TODAY, ESPECIALLY THE FINANCIAL FACTS. IT GAVE ME AN INSIDERS LOOK AT WHAT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, DRUG COMPANIES AND HOSPITALS ARE UP TO. IT IS EXTREMELY WELL CRAFTED AND HAS A WEALTH OF INSIGHTFUL INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PEOPLE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE MEDICAL ARENA."
4,Great buy if you like Spacemen 3 and space rock...,"This is a great buy if you like Spacemen 3 and space rock. If you don't like either of the two, than you'll not like Alpha Stone and you might want to put your music taste under review. This cd even features Pete Bassman from Spacemen 3. I just got this cd yesterday and find myself enammored with the electronic beats and psychedelic guitar that overlaps and shifts the music, taking you to places in your head you thought only drugs and/or deep seeded meditation you learned from your guru could ever take you."
4,I loved Daniel and Identified w/ Lucy,"This book was one of the LONGEST books that I have read in awhile (over 600 pages) but I read it in a day and a half! I was so smitten for Daniel! You could tell that he absolutely adored Lucy, and why shouldn't he? Lucy was a lovable gal who makes the mistakes that many of us do, falling for the wrong man!For those of you Jane Austen fans, didn't this book remind you a little of the love story in Jane Austen's ""Emma""? This was a GREAT book! A must read for the romantically challenged!"
1,This book was a train wreck,"I found myself compelled to finish this book despite the fact that there was so little to like about the main character. She whined, she complained and she had little to make her compelling. There are many better books out there to read. This one is a definite pass."
2,A Bridget Jones Knock-Off,"Although engaging at times, Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married is nothing more than a poorly veiled take-off on the wonderful Bridget Jones' Diary. Keyes didn't even bother to change her characters' names from those originated by Helen Fielding. The annoying Lucy and pious Daniel deserve each other."
2,trite and predictable,Did Lucy absolutely HAVE to be addressed by her name in every single sentence?
1,Did not appeal on many levels,"Typically I love chic lit books, and, when I lived in England, I developed an appreciation for many British romance novelists. So I was looking forward to the arrival of this book, but I ended up hating it. I had to dredge through it, and I actually continued to read it only to see what I would hate next. I don't remember all the things that annoyed men, but I do remember one in particular. There's an American guy whom Lucy goes on a date with. He is portrayed as having every stereotypically bad American image. His character just seemed so unrealistic, and what's the point of putting in a character that's so terrible? We all know that Lucy couldn't possibly fall for him. Still, I felt insulted that an American was portrayed as such an awful character."
2,"not bad ,but not that good either!","I discovered this author when I found the book ""Watermelon"" Then I read ""Rachel's Holiday"" These books were great, I mean really great. Now on to this one. There are over 400 pages and after about 150 of them I knew what the outcome had to be but I read it anyway. This one's pretty boring even for Keyes. It's readable but I cannot recommend it. I would not give this one to a friend. But read the other two."
1,Glad I don't have friends like Lucy,"While the writing of this novel isn't bad (in fact, the characters were well-drawn), the people populating it are not even remotely nice. I so didn't want Lucy to get anything she wanted--she whined and judged her way right into my trash can. I couldn't even finish this book, I despised the characters so. I hope Lucy's marriage was a big failure, since that just what she'd wish on anyone else. I don't want to meet Lucy and friends anywhere."
4,I love Lucy!,"As a young woman who was stuck with an Irish beer loving chauvenist like Gus myself once (- and dealt with him in a similar way!) this book was like reading about me. This is a great, easy read for those who want a fun love story without the cliches - yes, you know what will happen once you read about 2 chapters, but you'll enjoy every minute!"
4,"Good, funny .. but with a real message.","What I thought would be a really swift read and a very funny book was that and more. For those women who are the adult children of alcoholics and who read the book, there may be some jolts of reality and some ugly truths. Good book!"
5,Go buy all of Keyes' books!,"I have read all of Marion Keye's books. Most were bought from Amazon I think she is my all time favorite author. This isn't classic literature folks but her work is so much fun and so entertaining. Do yourself a favor. Buy this book and if you have already read it get Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday, and Last Chance Saloon. You will be waiting and waiting for more."
3,Nice when they work,It takes a pretty stiff wind to get them to ring. In a light breeze the bells sway together and rarely strike each other.
2,Poorly made,"My old breuer chair seats make these Chinese made replacements look new. The workmanship and materials are not ""like they used to be"". For a replacement product, I would rather get the old ones recaned."
4,Good warmers,I did like the warmers but it did not last 18 hours like it advertised. I still will purchase again. I did recommend this product to a friend of mine and she also bought it.
5,HeatMax Hand and Body Warmer,"If you want some added warmth while your out on frosty morning or watching your soccer star then these are what you are looking for. I use three of these when out in the winter woods, one each for my hands and one at the base of the back of my neck. Make sure you use these larger body warmers and not the smaller hand warmers!"
5,Price is right!,In times like these it's good to get a little something for a reduced cost over normal 11 22 11
1,Junk!,"I bought the Heatmax product to use while camping, I used them just as the directions said to. They took an hour before any heat was produced and even then they only reached 99 degrees, far from the 126-144 mark that they claim. What little heat there was, only lasted 30 minutes and then died out completely, far short of the 18 hours that they claim. If you plan to use these in a survival situation, like I had plan to, youll be a Popsicle by mourning."
2,Gimme Danger,"Originally released in 1977 on green vinyl, what was essentially a demo tape recorded two years prior was given a studio tinkering by James Williamson for its sendoff on Bomp Records.The title cut is an Iggy classic, but the rest of the numbers is a mixed bag of mostly inferior material when compared with what the duo cranked out with The Stooges. A pair of Williamson-era songs with the legendary band - Johanna, I Got Nothin' - are interesting, but demonstrates how thin this collaboration was in a tumultuous time for Pop, who was attempting to get a grip on a number of personal demons.Firmly lodged in a time when The Stooges imploded and before Pop's comeback collaboration with David Bowie, the CD shows an tortured artist who is looking for more than a recording contract."
2,Not what You expict,"I paid 150$ for this book, expected a lot from it . Great picture gallery ,Doesn't show u haw to do it. It have some patterns but not whats in the picture .show u some easy stuff and never the cool stuff they presented."
3,Broken dreams,"I own two of these and both chopper bowls have shattered. The stem to the bowl sheds plastic particles into the food, undetected until someone bites it. My search for a replacement has ended in a corporate maze."
2,Died after minimal use,"We had this for about a year, and maybe used it once a month. Then it just stopped working while in the middle of blending something. It was a great product while it worked, but it is hard to recommend a kitchen tool this fragile."
5,"Nice book, but not what I was looking for",I ordered this book thinking that I would be getting more background on Mennonite cooking. It is a fine book though for anyone who just wants recipes.
4,A Cheddar Howl,"A crisp witted look into the life of Chip Kidd, circa his college years. With intelligent energy, rebel humour, and snarky banter between characters, ""The Cheese..."" is an wild, cognitional ride where smile and laughter are the hitch-hikers. You'll start the car, accelerate into full speed, traverse many miles of entertainment, and crash with an empty tank; so be sure to buckle your safety belts for this one!"
2,No doorway to graphic designer's thought,"I picked up the book hoping to learn about graphic designer's thought processes and techniques but was sorely disappointed. The novel contains nothing very insightful that anyone that has had a lit or art history class wouldn't sense ahead of time.Worse, beyond the critiques, the plot is largely dull, predictable, and pretty much preposterous. The affectation, which is supposed to be satiric, gets tiresome. The settings are often cartoonish so I'd say that Kidd's powers of observation are limited to visual items and consequently the novel isn't much of a sendup of academia/state schools."
2,Blech -- this is not a good book.,"The book begins well, but by the 2nd semester I was ready to drop out. At that point he had telegraphed the entire novel and the pages dragged by while I anticpated what would happen next. At some points I felt like I was reading a poorly re-worked version of Chabon's very fine Mysteries of Pittsburgh. Skip it."
5,Wild 'n' Evil,"Sinner is great band, true 80's style heavy metal. However this collection doesn't span over their 15 year career as it says here. It has songs from 5 albums that were made between 1995-2000 and one alternative version of the '93 album Respect. Still very good album, but I recommend buying those five albums instead because songs that are left out are quite as good as the ones choosen."
5,Best luggage I've ever owned,"Based on other more detailed positive reviews, I bought this bag for a one month trip in Europe. I have since taken it every time I fly. It's solidly made, supremely functional, and works nicely as a backpack for short trips. Highly reccomended."
3,Interesting Confusion,"""On Being Normal and Other Disorders..."" is in need of a good editor. I assume because of it is a translation as well as having such non-mainstream technical subject matter made editing impossible. That is unfortunate because the flow, logic, and structure has a very manic and almost psychotic quality as a result.Notwithstanding the struggle with understanding the author's idea development, I thought the Lacanian view of psychological development was very interesting. It provided an interesting and potentially workable link between Freudian psychoanalysis and attachment theory. I am intrigued by the possibility of seeing if there is a link between Lacanian theory and Shore's brain development work.Again, I wish it was more readable"
4,Inexpensive Replacement for Hard-To-Find Bags,"As the world moves to bag-less, jet engine machines, its hard to find supplies these days for one of the most powerful canister sweepers I've ever found. Bags fit, are fairly priced and function as required."
2,Open Bag,Mighty Mite vacuum bags were delivered on time but the bag containing the vacuum bags was open. The bags do not appear to be used.
1,Anatoli,"I have ordered it on Feb 25, 2010 and it was delivered on Mar 18 - looks like they used horses mail.In the Item Title they concern about 9 packages:Eureka Mighty Mite Style MM Vacuum Bags Microfiltration with Closure - 9 PackBut in product features they concerns about Bags:Product FeaturesMicro-Filtration Vacuum Bags for Allergy SuffersBags Style MM for Eureka Mighty Mite Vacuums by EnviroCareDesigned to fit Eureka Mighty Mite CanistersMay be they do not understand difference between 9 Packages and 9 Bags?I received one open Package with 9 Bags.Cons:1. Very slow delivery - 3-4 weeks;2. Tricky item description - they do not respect customer;3. Instead of the Eureka Mighty Mite Brand they sent the DVC Brand."
1,Music at its lowest,"Ok its deriviative, the soudn quality is bad and the singer stinks. What more is there to say? I think this band would be good if they at least pretended to care about the music but I think they are to busy trying to be something they are not....talented."
3,Nice but not durable,"I had no problem with the wind making them chime, and they're great to look at. But two of the stems have broken in the last few months. I don't know if it's metal stress or rust, but since our home is gated, I know that no one broke them. It would be great if the manufacturer guaranteed the entire chime, not just the tuning."
1,Dont waste your money!,I just got mine and it looks great...but...it doesnt ring at all unless you manually move them or unless its VERY windy outside.
1,Tinny and underwhelming,"The large garden bell has brass ""leaves"" that are meant to catch the wind. The leaves are sharp & could be a hazard in some situations. The tone of the bells is extremely tinny."
1,dissatisfied customer,"I am not pleased with the chimes as they do not chime; even in rain and stronger wind, I have yet to hear the tones I had expected."
5,Goth meets Prog,"I didn't see any mention below of the influence of the tradition of progressive/art rock on this band. But it is here, otherwise I know I wouldn't find it near as enjoyable as I do. I hope the baebes can bring the boys together now and again for another outing like this... If you like SUSPIRIA, other required listenings are IRIS, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, and FAIRYTALES OF SLAVERY (which I'm actually starting to think is better than SUSPIRIA). You can tell the personnel are into many kinds of music. I'm sure Katherine Blake was just bursting with ideas about this time. Her little affected snarl is the only thing sort of extraneous, beyond maybe once in a catalogue of albums. One more note: One review recommended we play this LOUD. Yep, that you almost *have* to do, the MSG records being in bad need of a remastering."
1,"Good grief, really?","Are we still harping on that same old saw? When will we grow up and stop seeing bogeymen around every corner? This book, like so many others of it ilk, is nothing more than ill-informed, poorly researched scare tactics. Like the 'rock music backward masking' craze of the 70s & 80s, this is just hype. This nonsense about role-playng games, ouija boards and such has been discredited over and over as balderdash. If you are looking for tabloid-quality sensationalism, you might get some good guffaws from this book. If you are a thoroughly credible fool, looking for a Big Bad Wolf to be scared of, you might just be weak-minded enough to be frightened by this trash. And by the way, of you're trying to understand a teenager who's into RPGs or the like, I have a revolutionary idea for you - talk to them and actually listen to what they have to say!"
4,"Good Video, but not what I expected","From the title ""Welding Techniques of the Pros"" I assumed that I would see a general welding video. Instead I saw how to weld aluminum which is a specialized area of welding. Nowhere in the description or title did it even mention aluminum. On the other hand the video did a good job of explaining the basic proceedures of welding aluminum and if that was what I was looking for I would have been pleased, but I was looking for general welding techniques and was very disapointed."
2,Welding Techniques of the Pros,"For nearly fifty dollars I expected much more than 32 minutes of video. The quality was ok, the little content that was there was good. They indicate in the video that there are more videos. At this price they should have been included. Unfortuately I had the video open before I realized that it was costing nearly 2 dollars a minute to view. The title is misleading but baced on the the previous review I ordered it because I am only interested in welding aluminum. For the cost I would not recommend this video."
4,Not Bad...but has small problems,"The watch itself is great and comfortable to wear, however, the buttons are a bit difficult to press and you can't turn the chime off when you are setting it up or changing settings. It beeps with every press of the button. Other than that...not too bad."
4,JVC VCR Head Cleaner,"The JVC DFC-2 VCR Head Cleaning cassette works great. I'm in the middle of transferring all my VHS tapes to DVD's, and this cleaner insures my heads are clean for the best tranfer possible. Great product, and by the way, Amazon may be one of the few places you can obtain VCR head cleaners, as the many electronic stores have stopped carrying the item."
5,Dack & Criminy Got to Go,"I enjoyed the books throughly and Ms. Daniels is a gifted writer. I agree with all of the other comments. Ms. Daniels if you're listening, please get rid of those made up words. They don't add anything to the plot and had kind of a negative effect on the flow of the words. I hope you make this a series."
5,Love it!,"I bought it to accompany my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. Since I have it, I haven't used any of my other pencils. It allows for comfortable writing without straining one's hand. It's stylish and of outstanding quality."
5,GREAT card for that price,"I bought this card 3 months ago, its outstanding, I have a 19"" widescreen in a Atholn64 3000+ and 1Gb dual corsair, and now my computer runs all the games 1400x900 that is the maximum supported resolution in my monitor, looks amazing, the 512MB let me load a lot of textures and the vivid application let you manage 2 profiles for gaming, 2 for photos, etc. it show you crisp and bright images, all my friends get astonished by my video card, that vivid profile manager gives you a plus that you just can get from msi, cause it cames with the msi drivers.Pros: Great price, great performanceCons: Runs a bit hot but it hasn't been a problem."
4,Sons & Daughters of God by Ken Wilson,It is an excellent book however it over price which makes hasten to buy more with you. Book price at $9.95 and you sold it at $32.95. ThanksMommie
1,expensive and quit working in 6 months,I've had 2 of these and both were constantly malfunctioning after 6 months. They just don't work and they're expensive!
1,Many False Alarms,This device has given many false alarms. When calling technical support they replaced the broken one. The replacement lasted about 6 months before it started giving false alarms.
1,8 Firemen Later,"Our CO/GAS detector has gone off three times with a reading of GAS, followed by a number in the 200's. The first two times that the alarm went off, we decided that it was a false alarm because we did not smell any gas. However, after the third time the alarm triggered we decided that we better call the fire department and have it checked out. The first four firemen that arrived asked me questions and walked around the house to inspect and look at the CO/GAS monitor. Then four more firemen showed up with a monitor to check the levels of CO and GAS. After inspecting the house and checking the CO and GAS levels in all of the rooms it was found that there was no CO or GAS present in my home. The alarm was again a false alarm. I wish we had researched this model number before purchasing this unit. We could have saved everyone a bunch of time."
1,explosive Subway sandwich,"After just getting my second false alarm for explosive gas in the last month, I decided to jump online and see if others have been having the same problem. I've been reading the reviews about how different odors are setting these things off, and now I'm chuckling because I think it may have been the smell of my Subway sandwich bread that may have set it off. I agree with a lot of the other posters - I think I will switch to a CO only detector."
1,"Yet another false ""GAS"" alarm","Allow me to join the ranks of those who have gotten a false ""GAS"" alarm from this unit. Since I have two units (one up and one down stairs) I brought the second unit into the room with the one that had the alarm and it didn't pick anything up. I called the local gas company and they had a guy out in about 30 minutes who couldn't detect any gas anywhere in the house. He assured me if the reading on the alarm was anything close to correct his equipment would have picked something up.Incidentally the unit that had the alarm gave it consistently until I replaced the battery (the unit was plugged into a AC outlet). I'll keep it a little longer but if it keeps giving false alarms I'm replacing it with a straight CO2 detector.Update: I got another false gas alarm and tossed mine in the trash."
2,Weird...just weird,"You can be sitting there and it registers ""0"" then all of a sudden it jumps up to 65 and the alarm doesn't go off. Plus, how the hell can you tell if its gas or carbon monoxide? (until its too late that is). It sucks when you go to bed and it's on ""0"" and it starts screeching at 65 just when you fall asleep. Too tempermental. I had to buy a seperate CO detector...this product is a POS."
2,Too many false alarms!,"This detector worked for about 6 months perfectly - then one day my mother visited my home and happened to spray Lysol in the kitchen (about 10 feet from where the detector was in another room). Well who knew that Lysol is an explosive gas! We were very alarmed at first and almost called the fire department to report a gas leak until I read the small print in the back of the instruction manual. This unit detects household gases such as those in hairspray, room sprays, etc as well as poisonous gases... I thought that knowing this I just wouldn't spray anything in the house -- wrong again! Once the alarm went off once, it continued to go off randomly and would not shut off (even when I took it outside it continued to go off for about 10 minutes until I removed the battery). Needless to say this became extremely annoying, and I will not be purchasing another!"
1,Throw it away!,"We had this unit for a year with no problem, then the false alarms started for explosive gas. The first time, I called the fire department, who responded promptly and checked the house from top to bottom. Everything was fine. They suggested that paint fumes might have set it off. A few more weeks and 2 more false alarms later, I realized it was going off every time I cooked with alcohol. Veal marsala, ribs cooked in beer, deglazing the pan with brandy, all made the alarm go off. Tonight, I realized the alarm was unplugged after the latest episode of the exploding beer alarm, and plugged it back in. Within minutes, the explosive gas alarm was going off again. What is it time? The full garbage can? Turpentine in the basement? Latex paint? Who knows. I think the real problem with this is that we are going WITHOUT a CO detector every time we leave this thing unplugged. I will go out TOMORROW and buy a CO only alarm."
5,Wonderful,"This is the best omelet pan I have ever seen. It has great quality, great heat distribution and wonderful color. A++++ Le Creuset"
1,A huge disappointment,"The cover says, ""The most secret things that the U. S. does...This book belongs in a vault!"" If you've bought it, the only place it belongs is in your recycling bin. I read every page, waiting for the excitement to begin, for the secrets to be revealed. Neither ever happened. I love submarine stories and have read many a good one, but this isn't one of them."
2,Of all the sub stories I've read...this is one of them.,"There are a lot of great submarine stories to read and this is one of them, unfornately it's just not told in the book. I never give up on a submarine book and I kept toughing it out untill the end ...hoping there would be some substance but it never happens. You keep thinking it's building up to a great finish but the last chapter is a give up and then it's over. Do yourself a favor.......do like the author did, skip this one."
5,Wow... dynamite,"Based on an earlier purchase from the same company, I went ahead and laid out for this video. I'm pleased to say it wasn't wasted money. This stuff is dynamite and beats the s**t out of what passes as karate today - these guys are out for blood. My only gripe is that some of the clips are a little too fast, but that's a small moan. I've watched it so many times now, I don't have to worry about missing the technique."
4,Better than I figured it would be.,"It's certainly not expensive, but it really performs quite well. I find the ear bud a little to large for my likes, but it's something I can tolerate. Sound quality is good, and the mic, while virtually unseen, works fine."
4,plane joe review,has a lot of features that i'll never use. but ill use a lot of them. big display easy to read keeps tract of importnat dates so u dont have to.
5,Ironman Watch with USB programming,"This watch has a lot of features, including phone and e-mail lists, countdown timer, alarms, etc. Only thing that would help is if it was made smaller for a woman's wrist. It's easy to program through a USB connection to a computer."
3,are they selling seconds of this watch?,"I had this same watch before, LOVED IT, but lost it. This one doesn't work as well - buttons take hard mashing to work right. Not so un-functional to return for a refund, just kind of a pain."
4,back on track,no more missed appointments or forgetting to take medication. easy to use and contains all the features you'd need and then some. only drawback is the cheap wristband
3,"OK, but not what I expected","Perhaps I didn't read the description enough, but I purchased this for an upcoming trip to Lourdes. I was expecting more about what to expect during my Lourdes experience, but this is more about one man's time in Lourdes and what he learned from serving others. It was written pretty well and an easy read, but not what I expected."
4,The Tamarack Tree Review,"This is a story of a girl named Rosemary leigh whos life has been misserable.Now an orfin living with her brother in London are moving t Vicksburg,America in the middle of a civil war.Someone may wonder how suspence and action is built in the story.It all starts in the begining of the book to the end. At first no one thinks Vcksburgh will be atacked, but as the story goes on Vicksburgh starts to be atacked.Next is some important events in the story. One is that Vicksburgh starts to be atacked. like supplies are being cut of such as food and cloths.The life of ""Rosemary Monica Stanford leigh, lived at the top of the Tamarack Tree. The wind blew strong and the wind blew free and toppled that Tamarack Tree, with Rosemary Monica Stanford Leigh,who fell kerplop and bloodied her knee"" Things are looking better as she moves to London with her brother and his new whife."
1,The Tamarack Tree A Terrible Book,"The Tamarack Tree is a terrible book about a young girl named Rosemary Leigh who was orphaned by the death of her mother. Rosemary moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi. She adapts to the culture of slavery whitch she still thinks that it is wrong to treat a person like furniture by buying and selling a human being because he or she was born with a different color skin . Rosemary learns what it is like to live durring the Civil War.In my oppion this book is very boring . Rosemarys house had a cannon ball come through the wall she moved into a wonderful mantion that she thought that it was bigger than Buckingham Palace . The book was a very boring book and no one should be forced to read it ."
2,Didn't Like it at all,"First Week one of the batteries blows up, leaving a burnt dock (and it said in the advertisement ""Switchis to trickle charge once the battery is fully charged"" so don't know what happened.Week 6th the Adapter dies.Week 7 bought a new adapter from local Radio Shack, with the same voltage and amp ratingweek 10 the Battery charger is dead now.Batteries on the other hand are still working. Ordered Maha-MH9000, lets see."
4,Cute but a bit of a gamble,"This frame is very cute and stylish. Ocean, seashell feel, but not cheesy. Downside, my first frame came in shambles. The shells had fallen off and the glass was shattered. The second one came in great condition. The second seemed to be better quality."
4,Best of Sara Evans!!!!!,"good cd!!!!!!!! looooooove it. the best songs on this c.d r: real fine place to start, cheatin, and you'll always be my baby."
5,This album is the BEST!,"This is Sara's best release so far. This CD is 100% her and 100% amazing. Her vocals are showcased and allowed to shine in each and every song. The first single ""A Real Fine Place To Start"" already has been at #1 on the charts for 2 weeks and the new single ""Cheatin"" looks to be a huge hit too! Every song on this CD is incredible but some highlights are: Coalmine, New Hometown, Supernatural, Cheatin', Momma's Night Out, and Bible Song. Do yourself a favor and get this CD today. You definitely won't regret it!"
2,Fluff,"While I like the title track a lot, and ""You'll Always Be My Baby"" & ""Missing Missouri"" are good songs. I thought the rest of the album was filler. I was disappointed with this CD. Previous Sara Evan CDs have had three or more songs the calibre of the title track, and the most of the rest of the songs have been of the ""Missing Missouri"" calibre. Sara Evan should have waited a little longer to put out a better CD. The biggest upside to this CD is the well-done photography in the liner notes."
2,Whiny,I love Joan Rivers but the beginning of this book seemed to be a lot of whining about her parents. I was turned off by it and didn't read any further. Don Rickles book is far more interesting and entertaining.
4,HAS VELCRO STRAP!!!,"This is a decent looking sports watch, but the thing I didn't notice when ordering is that it has a ""velcro-fast-wrap-strap""... had I seen that in the details, I probably wouldn't have ordered it because it won't be much good once the velcro starts to wear out."
1,"Great watch, bad seller (MrWatch)","I like the watch fine - if I had been sent a working watch, I would give it 5 stars. However, I received a defective watch (many of the lines comprising letters and numbers do not function). Unfortunately for me, I notified the seller after 26 days from receipt. MrWatch's ""warranty"" is only 10 days. I have to send the watch to Timex with a check for $7 for return shipping and pay for shipping to Timex - $14.00!!! It's hardly worth the trouble for a watch that cost $26.36. And I won't have a watch during the repair period! So I have to buy another anyway.Mr. Watch's 10 day return policy for defective watches is buried on the fourth page of the product description, AFTER several paragraphs devoted to Timex's one year warranty and a long presentation about Mr. Watch's 365 day return policy!So. buy this watch from some other vendor. IMHO Amazon should not sponsor vendors that have ridiculously short return periods, and engage in deceitful practices on-line."
4,Paints the Key Points of the Language with a Broad Brush,"Like so many of the books on the market, this builds up through a series of examples a simple RISC processor in VHDL. One of the key things to keep in mind, is that this approach may not prepare the user for some other types of VHDL tasks, and so other texts may be needed as well. For example signal processing concepts for VHDL are not covered, nor are Ethernet MAC concepts, or a host of other complex area's found in today's technologies. It does a reasonable job of covering the features of VHDL in a fashion such that one can implement a RISC processor or similar device. Many of the tool's presented in the book are getting a bit dated, now, and one may be able to download web-pack type software for free that does a better job with the examples. Realistically to get fully equipped for most types of design expect to need a range of books that cover the different area's that the Language has been adapted to."
3,need help,hi im looking for a air duct for a 89 camaro 5.7 thats 5 to 6 inches long the one i have is to long can u help?
4,Not too shabby.,"I bought this CD after having purchased ""Simple Times"" and ""The Rock and The Tide."" Although this CD isn't my favorite of the three, it is still true to his style (especially since it is his first CD)."
2,Joshua Radin,I saw Joshua Radin on the Ellen Show and Loved the song he sang so I purchased the CD.All the songs sounded the same to me and became monotone. Just not what I expected.I like a little mix-up in Tempo from song to song. He does have a great voice though.
2,Snooze Fest,All the songs sound the same. I wanted to like it more but it just didn't. I guess I'll trade it in at the local CD store.
4,Hidden gem,"A hidden gem filled with sentimental lullabies and heartful songs that evoke love and love lost. Priscilla Hartranft's vocals mix well with Radin's and make for sweet music. Must listen to Sundrenched World, star mile, closer, and winter."
5,Something new in haunted house films,"I thought I'd seen just about all the variations on the theme of hauntings that there were in film, but I'm happy to say that Mike Legge has proven me wrong. There is a twist to this one that I not only didn't see coming, but have never seen before in any other film. EVAN STRAW was not filmed in a studio, nor did it have a million dollar budget, and the film prospers from both factors, because it doesn't look like a ""hollywood"" haunted house film.The characters react to the proceedings in refreshingly realistic ways.Up until this film Legge has been making comedies ( HONEY GLAZE, DEMOCRAZY among them) but with this entry he turns to the serious world of the supernatural, and with amazingly chilling results. If you're looking for a new thriller to add to your collection, or for something different to watch on Halloween, I assure you this film is the perfect choice!"
4,Incredibly Unique Chopin,"Samson Francois was a French pianist who is often associated with the French composers such as Debussy, Ravel and Faure. Samson Francois is indeed a wonderful interpreter of all their works. If you have never heard Francois, and you are a lover of Chopin this box set is a must listen. Francois' Chopin is extremely unique and may even sound upsetting to those accustomed to the Chopin of Artur Rubinstein. From the Waltz's to the Ballades, Samson Francois' Chopin remains unique, incredible and he remains to this day one of the most underrated Chopin interpreters."
2,Ethical Problem,"I have been a fan of Susan Krinard. She's an original writer who has expanded the limits of romance, but this book was seriously problematic for me.The success of a romance depends on the reader believing that the primary couple are experiencing true love. When the primary couple are therapist and patient, it could be that what is happening is a phenomenon called transference. This is why it's considered unethical for therapists to become romantically involved with their patients. It bothers me that Susan Krinard doesn't even mention the issue of transference in her author's notes where she does go into the controversy over recovered memories. Yet the problem of transference is central to the novel. This is an ill-chosen concept for a romance. It makes me uncomfortable."
3,Not what I expected or needed,I heat my house with wood. I bought this to use while cutting and splitting wood to burn. It is useless to me as you can not use it at all for a hammer. I need a hatchet that I can use to pound in wedges while falling and bucking trees and to chop off small branches. It is not big enough to split anything but kindling. Looks and feels nice but if you need a full functoning hatchet pass on this one.
5,Awesome!,"Next to a GB, which will cost you at least hundred dollars, this is the best hatchet on the market at the price range."
5,My husband can't wait!!,He loves it and it looking forward to using it when the weather gets nicer. You can't go wrong with Fiskars
5,Work made Fun? Throw away your gym membership!,What a great axe! I had to split about 4 cords of wood so I was going to rent a log splitter to get the job done quickly when I came across this axe. I felt like Paul Bunyan spliting logs in one fell swoop. I was already in shape but using this axe worked out my core better than any ab machine at the gym. My whole body strengh increased after using this axe to cut wood an hour at a time.Buy this axe and get the sharpener that goes with it. Keep it in shape and it'll keep you in shape.
3,Grilling,I was disappointed in the grill.........the meat sticks to the grill even though it has teflon. I am unable to clean this grill properly getting all residue off.
2,Overpriced for a paperback,"Got this for my dad to replace his old one that was falling apart. The description said we were getting a hardcover for approx $70 and instead we received it in paperback. Since this was the specific edition he wanted, we decided to keep it, but feel it was deceptively advertised and very overpriced."
2,Should not be this hard to use,"I was so excited to get this MP3 player, but have had several problems with it. It keeps freezing up on me which once caused it to overheat and then I LOST all the songs I had painstakingly put on it. I have used it two times since I purchased it at the beginning of January 2006. I did not have a hard time putting the music on, it is just time consuming. When it works, it works well."
4,Expedition watch #T46141,"My husband wanted a new watch for Christmas and this is the one he chose. He's an average build, but has smaller wrists and this watch looks very good on him. It's not too big and bulky. He wears it as a casual watch for work on days he doesn't have to ""dress appropriately"". It's just what he wanted."
4,Every recipe has been hit from this book,"I have owned this book for over 5 years. Every recipe I have tried from this book turns out great. I agree with another reviewer on the oil part. I just ignore the amount of fat recommended in the recipe, I just use a small amount (2-3 tblspns). Recipes are very easy to follow. Some of my favorite recipes from the book - Almond slices, Spiced cream of wheat, Sliced Beef with yogurt and spices, Bengali Style fish, Fired fish in Gram flour. I highly recommend this book for beginner or experienced cook alike."
5,Damn just Damn.,"when i had heard there was another cd released before NO wings to speak of and satellite years i began looking for it. When i found The frailty of words in hot topic i couldn't believe it.This is undoubtably one of the most heavy, beautiful and chaotic hardcore albums out there. The opening song shines through just nails you with the guitar work and lament is such a masterpiece. Many songs like The broken heart of a traitor as well as A winter's rose those tracks just kick your ass with the sound of them. The frailty of words is an ablum you should buy if you can find it."
3,"Starts on fire, ends smoldering.","Have read Cornwell since the beginning and generally find her engagning if formulaic. She is grinding too many axes with her own problems with relationships (the lesbian thing). Plus her endings have become quite anticlimactic (ala Robt Parker). Still, she has promise and stands well above many in this genre."
3,Nothing New,"Much the same as any other PC novel.Dr Kay is superior,her neice is gay, and all men should be treated with utter contempt. Readable but certainly nothing to be read here that you won't have read in all of her other novels. As I said after the last one I would love to see a Marino based novel with no Benton,Kay or Lucy."
3,Why so quick??,"Once again I was captured by the writing of Ms.Cornwell. Unfortunately she has, once again, disappointed me at the end. Cornwell has the abitlity to keep the reader attached and always wanting more. The new topic of germ warfare was especially interesting. My only complaint is that what should be the climax or final showdown is just simply stumbled upon without any deduction. I feel somewhat let down by the ending of Ms. Cornwell's novels."
3,"Intriguing, suspensful...disappointing ending","I am a first-time Cornwell reader, and enjoyed this novel very much. I liked how she developed the characters (even the minor ones) and although the idea of a biological terrorist is nothing new, I felt she presented this one in an original way. The book kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, until the terrorist's motivations were explained. I felt like I was missing something. As a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman, whose Alex Delaware novels dig deep into the madman's reasoning for his crimes, I was disappointed at the ""why"" factor for all the mayhem. However, I was thoroughly entertained and look forward to reading another of Ms. Cornwell's books."
1,A Victim of Success,"Patricia Cornwell's writing has deteriorated in direct relation to her ascending fame. Isn't it clear by now that the character of Kay Scarpetta is essentially herself? Does Scarpetta really function as an M.E. anymore? The plot was as weak as the story was long winded. With each book, the characters lose another dimension of their personalities. It's time to take a break Ms. Cornwell."
2,This book leads to nothing,"The first part of the book had me interested. I was starting to wonder what was going to happen and thought that the plot was pretty good. That did not last long. It seems like the author either ran out of ideas or did not care enough to continue the book properly. Huge plot holes and a lot left unsaid. How can you drop a character that seemed to be rather important in the middle of the novel like that? That was weird. I will not read any of her books again, that was a huge disappointement. Too bad because the idea was really good, but poorly explored and the characters were not well developped."
3,Not Bad,"This is not one of Patricia Cornwell's best. It lacks the suspense and quality of some of her other novels. There are boring sections and too many subplots. Though somewhat of a disappointment, I did enjoy reading it. As mysteries go, I didn't solve the who done it, which makes it worth reading."
1,Complete Crap! Shame on Cornwell.,"It's a pity that an author can get away with publishing this poor a book just because she's written passably well before. Of course, she'll make money . . . but never again from me!"
2,Glad I waited for the paperback!,"I was really disappointed by this book. I find the rave reviews listed at the beginning of the paperback extremely hard to swallow, considering the sheer number of loose ends, disjointed information and just plain implausibility of some of the characters' actions!! I wonder, does Ms. Cornwell need a complete break from the world of Scarpetta? Perhaps she should take time off and try to come up with a new hero or heroine. She definitely needs to plug into Amazon.com and read these customer reviews. It might be an eye-opener for her!!!!!!"
4,Excellent!,"The gruesome detail in this novel keeps you wanting more and more. An exciting read, especially for those who like the 'technical' details of the autopsies."
4,nnatural Exposure by Patricia Cornwell,"This is written in her usual genre - that of forensic medicine/crime. It is a very good read, especially if the reader is interested in this genre."
2,Not my favorite...,I typically go between James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell books on my Kindle... after reading almost exclusively James Patterson for the past 6 months I went back to Patricia Cornwell and purchased this book. It took me over a week to finish this book (usually it takes me 3 of 4 days.) It just didn't hold my interest and the ending was way too abrupt.
2,""" FEEBLE CONCLUSION "" This reader feels vaguely insulted.","The feeble ending leaves me confused. Why would someone write so well and then show so little thought as to the conclusion of the story? Remininscent of a much poorer genre. I enjoy Cromwell's previous books and so I will suspend my judjement until I read her next book. BUT 2 such poor efforts would cause me to consider dropping her from my reading list. I currently read a book every FIVE or six days so I consider my self a good supporter of authors. WHEN YOU WRITE , PLEASE WRITE SOMETHING 'YOU' CAN RESPECT. Lloyd Thomas"
1,Has Cornwell Lost Her Touch,"It is inconceivable of someone in this day and age to use an e-mail identifier and profile as obvious as Dr. Scarpetta. People have tried to kill her before, why not torment her through e-mail. The story was very weak. Her attempt to lure female readers with the Scarpetta/Benton previously adulturous romance fails. The story is not compelling and is poorly developed. After the debacle of Hornets Nest I expected much more. I continue to be disappointed."
1,Marjoleine Felius reviews cornwell,"I bought this book for a summer's day in the park read, and just now (november) was able to finish it. This has, of course, everything to do with the fact that this book is awful. I thought at first this had to do with the translation (I read it in Dutch) but after reading the other reviews, I guess its just as bad in english. Unfortunately, it is the first Cornwell book I've read, and I don't see myself reading another one."
2,Enough Already,"I enjoyed the first Cornwell novel I read very much (Body Farm), but they have consistantly gone down since then. I read several of the reviews complaining about the ending and realized I couldn't even remember it. Not a good thing for a suspense novel. I believe this is my last run with Ms. Cornwell"
1,Save your money and time!,Unnatural Exposure is over-exposure of Cornwell full of herself. It deserved a rejection slip
2,Splashing in the shallow end...,"These characters are becoming disturbingly one-dimensional. Benton Wesley may as well be made of cardboard, Lucy is all attitude and intellect, with nothing left to make her human and loveable to a reader, and Kay has utterly lost her poise, self-reliance, quick and sure judgement, and all the other qualities that made us want to BE her in the first few Scarpetta novels. Marino never was complex, so he has changed the least. Not that it's ever been credible to me that he became a police captain! I stuck with this because I wanted to confirm my early suspicions about the sort-of parallel plots -- and I was right. Too bad..."
4,Patricia Cornwell Does Not Disappoint.,"This may not have been my favourite Kay Scarpetta, but I still enjoyed it to the point where I didn't want to put it down. I find that Dr. Kay is getting more and more human with each book, and that's a good thing! In my estimation though, Ms. Cornwell dwells too much on the homosexual angle with each book. This leads me to question Lucy's authenticity since she seems less and less real with each book. I think the books would be improved without her character. Ms. Cornwell tries too hard with her, and it shows. But Kay, Benton and Marino are real characters. In this book we don't see as much of Marino and that's a loss. The story is intense and gripping, and the tension really doesn't ease up. The book deals with biological terrorism, and that is certainly a hot topic right now. For those of us Scarpetta lovers who love a tense and gripping tale with lots of forensics, this book does not disappoint."
5,Great Novel!,"I personally loved the book. The involvement of mystery with the Internet and killings drew me to the book even more. Every time you turn the page you just have to keep reading to find out what will happen next. Cornwell is a very graphic writer, which makes you even more engrossed into the story line. When Cornwell wrote about the email messages and notes the DEADOC (the killer) it brought fear into you. At one point, I had goosebumps! All around this was another great book by Cornwell. I will continue reading books by her."
2,Boo,"Bought this product a few days ago, and I'm off to return it tomorrow. While I like the concept, and the design, i had a few problems:1- too many cords everywhere! i know this is probably unavoidable, but it was just annoying...2- poor sound quality. the speaker cut in and out3- microphone had major feedback, wherever i placed it in relation to the speaker.but it was relatively inexpensive..."
4,nice,"Could be better, the ""set"" is fragile. I dropped one time from .. one foot and the silver plate with the 2 indicadors of pressure went out of the gauge. (those thins are useless)The gauge is good, nice blue light."
4,Judy Moody Saves the World,"Judy Moody Saves the World, by Megan McDonald, is a great book about a girl who wants to make a difference in the world. Children will love this book because it contains so many feelings and ideas that they can relate to in their everyday lives. Judy Moody is your typical third grade student and sister who takes things to extremes. She is intrigued by science, and she is destined to save the world no matter what she has to do! Judy Moody enters contests, fights for endangered species, and comes up with a great idea to save the rain forest. She does all of these things because she has enough courage to stand up for what she believes in. You will find humor in every chapter. I even laughed out loud as I read the story. I think seven,eight, and nine year olds would enjoy this book very much!"
5,Little Amadeus,The product was in almost new condition. The whole process was very easy and convenient. We will definitely use this vendor again for future purchase.
5,We love this book!!,"What a fun and wonderful book this is. My 3 1/2 year old son loves it and even reads aloud with me his favorite parts (THE COOKIE! THE COOKIE!). We really relate to how Sophie feels when she gets really angry and what it feels (and looks)like to have a tantrum. There are no judgements in this book, only real feelings and patience and understanding from a mom. And it has a peaceful loving ending too. Bravo! to Harvey Stevenson and Deborah Blumenthal.... encore! encore!"
1,"Poorly built, Thin plastic design, not water tight!","Purchased for my two day ATV trip. Poorly built, NOT water tight! Two problems with the design of this box. There should have been two locks on this box (on the left and right sides). The single lock in the center doesn't latch down the side corners well enough. There is a 1/4"" gap at each corner in the front of the box when you latch the center lock. I ended up needing straps to keep the box lid tight.Second problem is the THIN plastic used for the construction of the box. And the ribbing design doesn't help much for strengthing it. For an ATV box it needs thicker plastic walls to get if a firmer design. My friend had the Tamarack ""Classic"" series box which worked much better."
4,Koplin cargo box,"I like the capacity of the box. It seemed like it was just what I wanted, but it didn't fit on my Sportsman, because it would have blocked removal of the seat. Again, a nice cargo box and the size I thought I wanted, but just didn't fit my machine."
2,Disappointed,"Le Creuset cookware is my favorite, but this grill is an exception. It is an absolute nightmare to clean. I worked on it off and on for 3 days. My advice is to skip this item, and use the other, enamel-coated cast iron that makes Le Creuset so great."
5,Great addition to any room for holding blankets and quilts,"This is a sturdy, easily assembled blanket/quilt rack. It hold8 of my decorative blankets and fits nicely into one corner of the room. The house is much neater with the blankets beautifully displayed on this rack."
2,Slow track to... nowhere!,"This book seemed really cool to me when I read the synopsis, but when I read it, it seemed to be going nowhere really fast. It takes a lot of patience to get into it. I love plenty of drama in my romance novels. Nice and juicy. It's not good unless you can taste it, and i get the taste of water. I expected more of a fizzy soda pop drink. Really, to me, its a disappointment."
2,A 20 year old rehash of old ideas,"When this book was first issued back in 1979, the information was contemporary and useful. Unfortunatley for this book, the world of Ford performance has changed drastically in the last twenty years. I have the original print of this book and was looking forward to this update. Boy was I disappointed. The cover says, ""Includes all Modern Ford Performance Engines."" I guess this means anything built after the flathead. The engine building techniques are old, the technology is old, even the part numbers are old. No information on the vast array of the new aftermarket aluminum heads and manifolds, fuel injection, ignition systems, etc. or anything on the new Modular engines is offered. If you want a nostalgic look at what it used to be like or general information on older hot rod Ford engines, this book may be for you. If you have the first printing of this book or are trying to build a cutting-edge modern Ford engine, forget it."
4,"Excellent book covering Windsors, Clevelands, FE's, & Limas","If you are building one of the above engines for the first time this is a must have book that teaches you the basic tricks you need. Another reviewer unfairly blamed the book for not covering the new 4.6L engines. It only says on the cover exactly what engines are covered, duh! So, ignore his comments and buy Too Tall Ganahl's book with confidence. The only thing I would have liked to have seen are a casting number list, otherwise an outstanding book."
4,An engrossing and entertaing novel,"Like Buckley's other novels, plot, characterization and moral satisfy. Interesting historical perspectives. This is light fare and easy to read in one sitting"
4,He Knows My Name,"As usual, Israel Houghton has done it again. God really used him on this dual disc. It was a service on this CD, not just music or a concert. This bad boy will take you straight into worship. I love the pipe organ sound on ""Alpha and Omega"" and the beats of the african drum beats on many of the songs. He allows a special blending of instruments that others seem scared to try on their CD's. The little girl singing on the last part of ""Not Forgetten/He Knows My Name"" was a beautiful touch. Let's not even talk about ""No Limits"". God bless you Israel and New Breed. Our praise team sings from this CD, not because it is you Israel, but because it is truly a message from God. THANK YOU for being a faithful messenger."
2,What a disappointment :(,I can't believe that Wendi and Richard sell their story like it was some cheap....@#$!*&^!!! They receive my ultimate praise for the first four compilations (the original #1-#20)which are the best fantasy epic that I have ever read but anything after that I do not bother reading. The quality of the artwork has gone way down and it is as if some giant tornado has come along and swept up all the characters I knew and replaced them with the X-men! Please Richard and Wendi save the characters we all know and love and bring them back to us!
3,Victor Carl returns,"First let me say that I am a Victor Carl fan. That said, although very readable, this is not the best of the Carl books. I'm sorry but the new investigator just isn't as good as the old one. As usual, Victor bumbles his way through solving the crime but the characters just don't seem as realistic as Lashner usually delivers"
2,Tedious!!,"Count me among those who miss the original William Lashner. While this book kind of pulls you through it by the nose, if for no other reason than to find out what happened to Chantal Adair, it turns out to be a rather dull conclusion. Not too many of the characters have any authenticity to them and the plot turns and twists turn out to be more tedious than energizing.The book jacket says ""It takes a deeply flawed lawyer to solve a perfect crime.""Victor Carl certainly qualiifies as deeply flawed. The crime, while unsloved however, is far from perfect. Worse than that, it isn't even very interesting.I'm afraid this is a non-starter."
3,a mildly entertaining mystery,"This novel starts out strongly, with a lawyer waking up with a hangover and a tattoo of a woman's name on his chest. The name is from a young girl who disappeared many years before. There seems to be a connection between that girl and another case that the lawyer is involved in. The novel is narrated by Victor Carl, a sleazy lawyer, who tries to deal with his dead-end life and career. At the same time, there are enough twists and turns in his investigation of the linked cases to keep one's interest. The author fills in for the slow spots with humor from Victor Carl's narration. Overall, this is a decent legal thriller."
3,Good book but lacks enthusiasm.,"The writer did an Ok job, but he just rambles off and makes it confusing and boring. His thoughts are all over the place, not organised. Unless you have very good knowledge on WW1 and WW2, do NOT BUY OR READ this book. The writer himself was confused! Despite the fact that the 3rd edition was published in 2007, there is as far as I can remember, no mention of some very key personalities like Karl Haushofer and many more. I promise you, if you read this book without Significant knowledge, you will feel that the author published this book just for the heck of it. Other reviews may inspire you to buy this book but they ALL have a firm knowledge on Wars thus their reviews. I wanted this book for a major book review and really regretted selecting this book, I hope you will have better luck than me."
3,Carnelian earrings,These earrings were a disappointment to me. Colors were off a little and one stone is slightly chipped and the sizes of the square stone are different. I've bought several other items and this is the only one that disappointmented me.
1,Bad Movie but good Soundtrack!,"The movie is not good at all, no real storyline, it's all over the place, but I would love to know where I can find the soundtrack, the songs sounded pretty good, it's sad when you pay more attention to what's playing in the background than to the actual movie. Good concept, but the movie felt like it wasn't finished, and there better not be a part 2!"
3,Confusion,This movie left a lot of parts out. People was coming in and out of the movie but with no connecting roles.
1,"To the person that said ""My Scene doesnt wear tattoos""","I hate Bratz Babyz, but the person who said that My Scene doesnt wear tattoos is an ignorant moron.Have you ever seen the Club Birthday My Scenes? They all have tattoos. Next time you say something like that, check your facts out. Friggin' idiot."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Excellent read. I laughed out loud so many times reading this. The characters were well rounded and fairly realistic. It is a romantic triangle complicated by the fact that one of the lovers is a ghost. This doesn't come off as hokey or sappy as one might expect. I didn't like the ending, though. Without giving it away, I'll just suffice to say that I felt one of the main characters was portrayed completely against his established personality.As with other self published novels, this one has spelling and grammatical errors. Fortunately, they do not detract from the story. This book is well worth the price and reading it was a pleasure. Ms. Druga definitely has talent."
4,negativland 8-10 place,"This albumn, from 1983, trys to tell a story. The story is in a place called pleasant hill, where the green slim can make you turn invisible. The whole album is based around this story.pretty classic negativland.includes a sticker, a map of contracosta county and a burnt piece of wood that is part of the story.pretty cool in my opinion."
3,A difficult read,I found this book to be obtuse and difficult to read. I'm glad others got more out of it. There are probably better ones out there.
3,THE PALE BLUE EYE,"Well written, well plotted (make sure you read to the very end before deciding the full mystery has been explained), and I give it points for taking very seriously an often-overlooked Poe piece that on its surface seems more like an essay than a tale or short story.I'm probably a little understated, some might even say stingy, on assigning stars -- have even been accused of writing a bad review when I thought I'd written a very favorable one. But that's just my way. As an aficionado of mysteries with Poe as detective and/or red herring, I enjoyed this one. -- Phyllis Ann Karr"
2,Gothic drivel,"Most of the other reviewers have summarized the story very well, so I will not repeat, but instead write subjectively.The book was given to me in a batch to read while recovering from major surgery. I read it completely, but was all the while wishing it had been better edited, and was shorter.The turgid prose and dense poetry did not appeal to me, but then I am not a Poe fan, either.There are too many just plain unbelievable elements. For instance, how was the disguised Lea strong enough to wrestle with Landor outside the tavern?If one likes Gothic romances, and can appreciate the dark atmosphere, this might be an enjoyable book. But for me, reading it was merely a way to pass time and take my mind off the ennui of post-surgical recovery."
1,Interesting But Poorly Constructed,"This book was given to me by a liberal friend.I found it interesting but full of factual errors. For instance,he states that American servicemen killed 23 Panamanians in the riots of January 1964. Most of the deaths were caused by the rioters setting the Pan Am building on fire and becoming trapped in the blaze. They were firing their weapons at Americans across the Canal Zone boundary. I know. I was there. I managed to get about half way through the book before becoming discouraged by the author's bias."
1,Informacion incorrecta,"Yo la compré porque dice contener 400GB de memoria pero no contiene ningún disco duro interno, es únicamente el Case para ponerle un disco duro, junto al conector USB y el de electricidad."
3,Summary of intros,"Well, a book serves as a summary of optical systems intro.Formulas pop up without derivations, some chapters are just a few pages long. Published 7 years ago, some pictures are hard to see the details or even the sketch.."
3,great picture not so good at keeping a charge,This is a great camera the pictures are wonderful.The options are so nice to have. As far as the pictures go it's right on... great pictures every time. Problem is the batteries just don't last even the rechargeable ones are drained real fast. If it weren't for this one thing I think it would have been a teriffic camera.
4,Good camera but can be had for cheaper,"This camera is one of the cheapest that offers image stabilization, a big plus to many people. Also, for 7.1 MP's it's a good bargain, however it can be had cheaper at $149 if you look at froogle dot com."
5,Comprehensive and Valuable,"Sufferers of pancreatitis and their families will want to have this book - it's a well-organized gateway to a broad range of seemingly-current sources of information about all aspects (one imagines) of the disease and its management.Price is high for its ""build quality"", but that shouldn't stand in the way of anyone who wants to begin learning a tremendous amount about this illness."
4,Good - but didn't destroy Platonism,"There's a lot for professional mathematicians, teachers, and students to chew on in this book. The authors are bold yet constrained in their theses, clearly enunciating their arguments point by point, and seem to be willing and encouraging a dubious reader to enter a debate about the origins of math, and from their the implications. Fortunately they reject the excesses of postmodernism, but for this reviewer they did not succeed in eliminating what they've called ""The Romance of Mathematics."" Even if granted that all of math starts out from metaphors, and even if it's accepted metaphors are only an anthropic construct, that does not make it so that x^n + y^n = z^n for any n>2. Recommended for the challenges it brings."
5,Great Women's Multivitamin!!,"So far I have been taking these multivitamins for 5 days. I originally purchased them off Amazon after reading all the positive reviews. I really liked that these pills were all natural with no added dyes to them. I've tried many different kinds of multivitamins in the past but so far these are the only ones that don't upset my stomach. They are a large pill but I have been able to swallow them just fine. Since they are not coated, you have to get used to the taste of them when you put them on your tongue but if you swallow them right away, it's not a big deal. The taste could be so much worse! My doctor has been on me for some time now to get on a multivitamin since I don't have the best eating habits ;) so I think she will be pleased to hear that I FINALLY found one I will be sticking with! Great product! Highly recommended! I plan on buying the men's version for my boyfriend soon!"
4,Great vitamin but stains!,"My 18 month old eats these just fine. Granted he has never had candy or any type of gummy vitamin, he finds these to be yummy. My toddler isn't the cleanest eater and the color from these will stain things that it touches. I had to color safe bleach some clothes in hot water to get the stains out. Overall, great natural vitamin that's derived from fruit and vegetables. These really don't taste that bad...not any worse than Flintstone vitamins which are usually full of sugar."
4,Good Ingredients,"I don't really like reviewing supplements because how do I know? I do like the ingredients in here though, and I had a healthy baby!"
2,Rainbow Light Nutri Stars Multivitamin & Multimineral Chewables,"I thought the little ones would take their vitamins if they were chewable and fruity.Turns out that the older one (3yrs) threw it up. Ok, maybe one's preference. Tried it on the younger one (2yrs), and that was victim #2. Without being influenced by the first victim, the younger one vomited it up too.Maybe it's the batch?I returned it immediately.Not recommended."
5,Love these,They are very small and don't upset my stomach like the big horse pills do. Really easy to digest. Great buy as my naturopath told me about them.
2,SLEEPY HEAD,"I'm not pregnant but I wanted a good organic vitamin and thought these would be the perfect one considering they're organic and had greeeat review. BUT PLEASE BE AWARE--ALLL I do is sleep all day especially on weekend when I am of from work.I need a viatmin that will give me strength to keep up with my daily routine not one that puts me in bed!I've try to take at night and do sleep like a babbby, however, regardless of that fact, I still am Sleepy ALL DAMN day.I wonder if I am the only one with this problem when it comes to this multi-viatmin.HMM?"
1,Great Product and Price but all vitamins were broken!!!!!!,All the vitamins were broken!! Great product and price but not if they are broken! Inspect your bottle on arrival! We didn't find out til we needed to open a new bottle.
3,Average,"I've been using these for a couple weeks now, and dont notice much of a change. It seems like there is lots of good stuff in them, and they seem like a good multivitamin however I dont see much change in my health since taking them."
4,Good product!,"It is good product and arrived on time. I thought it is one pill daily, however, it's supposed to take two to four pills a day. So its 120 capsules only work for about a month."
1,Beware: B vit levels much higher than most other multivitamins!,"All supplements are not created equal. I bought these because I try to avoid artificial colors and additives. I only realized after taking these for several months that they contain excessive levels of some vitamins. While it's hard to OD on Vit B's and other water soluble vitamins, it is not impossible. At these levels, some people might experience issues with prescription meds, their nervous system, or their kidneys. Better to stick to a more balanced multivitamin."
2,they float,"I purchased the Rainbow Light Women's Organic Multivitamin, 120 count. They FLOAT in your mouth when you try to swallow the capsules with water. I thought they would be like the Women's One, which I had previously, and thought I would try the organic. I think the contents of the vitamin is wonderful, and it has so much good stuff that I will continue to choke them down (I can only do two a day). Plus I already purchased it. I tried to open the capsules and sprinkle it on food, but wow does it taste bad."
2,As the kids would say... double yuck...,"Typically we equate ""Chewables"" = ""gummies"". Nope, these are slime green pressed tablets just a touch larger in diameter then a quarter and about 1/8in thick shaped in a star pattern. They are very fragile and taste like sugared chalk. Yuck.Added to that they kind of leave a residue/after taste in your mouth that's hard to wash away. Double yuck.Our kids (age 5 and 3) will eat them only if we sandwich it between something less offensive.On the plus side, it is real food based and does have iron so I do like the ingredients. Just wish the delivery vehicle weren't so noxious!"
2,Slow shipping,We like the product but it took even longer than the estimated shipping. It was almost a week longer than they stated.
5,The best!,"I've been taking these for about a year now and don't plan on ever changing. They give me lots of energy and more importantly, they don't upset my stomach (like most others of this strength)."
5,Plant based vitamins,I have had a lot of trouble in the past taking vitamins. Women's One has been working out just fine for me. I highly recommend this vitamin.
4,DECENT VITAMINS,I PURCHASED THESE VITAMINS AND I LIKED THEM. SEEMED TO DIGEST WELL AND THEY WORKED PRETTY WELL. I WOULD RECOMMEND.
4,Easy to swallow prenatal,"This multi-vitamin has never upset my stomach or made me burp. The size and shape of the vitamin makes it easier to swallow than many of the competitors. Be aware the vitamins are not coated though, so you have to swallow them quickly or they will begin to dissolve on your tongue--nasty. 4-stars only because it doesn't have much in the way of pro-biotics and does not contain any omega acids. Otherwise, an excellent choice."
2,Just a heads up!,"I ordered these vitamins through a different site after having taken the regular Rainbow Light Prenatal tablets. What I failed to realize (and I know this is my fault for not scrutinizing the ingredients) is that this formulation includes American Ginseng which is considered potentially unsafe during pregnancy when I looked it up and asked my healthcare provider. I mistakenly assumed that the organic formulation was comprised of the same ingredients but, from organic sources. I was also told during my last pregnancy not to drink a particular protein shake that contained Ginseng because of reproductive deformities that could occur in my child. There is conflicting information about the safety of this herb during pregnancy and I'm of the mind that its better to be safe than sorry. You can make your own decision. Just FYI, this formulation DOES contain American Ginseng. I will most likely NOT use this if/when I conceive."
5,Great stuff,"My kids have been taking this for several (10+) years, at the recommendation of my father, who owned a health food store. It's not only a really good multivitamin but also includes vegetable extracts, which can only help overall health. They are (I believe) above-average on the healthy scale, seem to get sick less often than most of their peers. Their diet is pretty good, but I look at this as a way to make sure I'm not missing anything. They are slender but not skinny, strong, and alert kids - this stuff may have helped.For a few months I ended up taking this when I ran out of my normal multivitamin, and I felt great. May have been coincidence, but who knows."
4,"Great Vitamin, Super Easy to Swallow","I have always had a hard time swallowing pills. When I told my doctor that my husband and I were planning on starting a family in a few months, she gave me sample of prenatal vitamins. The vitamin could be taken whole or chewed if I couldn't swallow pills. When those ran out, I needed to find an OTC vitamin I could swallow...Thank goodness for Prenatal Petite!! Imagine slicing a regular vitamin into thirds--they're thin and oval shaped. They have a funny vitamin taste but since I can swallow them quick enough it doesn't both me. I would recommend these to anyone has trouble swallowing pills. I cannot say if they are making me sick--I'm not pregnant yet!"
2,I am not sure...,"I saw the great review and bought this product, but very soon I noticed this product made me queasy. Also it has too much Vitamin-B (at least for me). My urine turned bright yellow. Does 1667% of DV sound extremely a lot??Maybe I just keep my healthy diet. No diet supplement can be better than eating healthyRainbow Light Women's One Multivitamin 90 tablets"
4,great supplement,Our pediatrician recommended a multi for son and these work great. DS (3yrs) chews them up no problem and reminds us when we forget them.
3,A rebel's rebel,"Given free rein to investigate anything about the company, its operations, finances, and history, Athearn uncovered some interesting tidbits. Although sponsored by the D&RGW, this book is an unbiased review of the legal wrangles which shaped the railroad, as well as of the operational practices which twice led it into -and out of-bankruptcy. A bit heavy on the intricacies of court documentation and testimony at the many hearings, ""Rebel"" still imparts the entrepreneurial spirit which created the Palmer road, as well as the pioneering attitudes which ensured the Slim Gauge would become an institution into the late 1960s."
5,A book that will gain momentum,"The Letters is a great piece of literature for those who believe that something outside of humanity is directing the universe. For Hanzelik and and millions of others, this reviewer included, that something is the personal and loving God of the Christian faith, made incarnate through Jesus Christ.Through a series of inter-connected stories, Hanzelik clearly evinces the way in which God is pre-eminent and merciful. The novel is wonderfully consistent and a quick read due to its short, fast-paced chapters.This novel is not meant to be mired in pre-suppositional difficulties or fraught with philosophical haughtiness. However, its themes are something the reader can ponder deeply.I would highly recommend it to those of the Christian faith or those curious about the Christian understanding of how God moves throughout His creation."
5,Review,"I think that this book is fantastic! If you like Buffy, the show, you would love this book. There are so many interresting stuff in this book. I never thought this book would be this great, but it is... If I were you, I would buy THIS book."
5,Does the job! Accurate and precise.,"This set does the job. It is accurate and precise. The wooden box is a nice touch. You don't wan these precision instruments rattling around loose in a drawer, and wood cushions them and keeps out humidity better than blow-molded plastic cases. Those blown plastic cases never fit the tools exactly right due to warpage and manufacturing variation, so the tools are not as well protected."
3,Bought this one first,"I bought this camera first and was very happy with it. Then I found a Casio QV-3EX Plus and it is the next step up and has a 340 microdrive, all software, cables, etc.(unless your computer has no USB port, then you have to get a serial port-USB cable), other than that, the 3EX Plus surpasses the Casio QV3000EX 3.34-Megapixel Digital Camera with 340 MB MicroDrive."
3,You would have to be an IDIOT to buy any other camera,"With all the storage space, I don't see why anyone would buy any other camera."
5,Best foundation building book out there!,"This book is by far the best foundation learning tool I've yet to come across. Everything is explained clearly and in a way almost all will understand. I've literally taken my playing-and my understanding, further in two months than in the last 15 years! The graphics are well laid out and promote the reader to keep up interest unlike many books with monotonous staffs or never ending pages of tabs. I believe this book would be a great pre-curser to the Grimoire Series. The Grimoire's are straightforward and a bit monotonous but also have their place. They pack a lot of information from cover to cover. The Guitar Scale Guru provides for that understanding that IMO is necessary before pursuing a more in depth series such as the Grimoire's. Great job Karl!! I would've given this book 10 stars!"
2,alright saw,So far I would have to say the wood blade is almost as good as my sierra saw blade. The bone blade barely gets through the chest cavity of a white-tail deer. I am hoping to try the very fine vlade in a deer as well. If that doesn't work I'd say the saw is a bust
5,Wow!,"I absolutely love this show. I first saw it at a sleepover at my cousin's house and I thought it was adorable. I started watching clips on YouTube and fell in love with the series. When I heard about this DVD, I immedietly added it to my wish list. I checked it out at my local library (along with Dogs 101, which was also great) and loved it. I have a Maine Coon Mix at home and I watched the Maine Coon part first. The charactheristics of the Maine Coon. Adorable and interesting, this is for cat lovers of all ages!"
1,Annoying game,"I rented this game recently to decide if I want to purchase this title. I'm a die-hard RPG gamer, and enjoy all forms of RPG. As has been mentioned, you can not stop the extended cinematics (it seems like there's one for every single room). The most annoying aspect of the game, in my opinion, is the banter between characters. It's a voice over game, which is usually pretty cool. But this one in particular is nothing but people yelling at each other in the most snide way possible. After a few minutes, I felt so on edge and upset that I was tempted to just turn it off right then. But I figured, hey, maybe it'll get better. It never does. Don't bother."
2,A bad review,"Normally i hate writing these but if it saves your money...... This game is a decent RPG, when you actually get to play, this game has way to many movies hardly moving the story along. Main thing I hated was the movies.. they are just filled with whining, and you get them every 3 minutes max!(unless you work slowly) The battle style is not ""stupid"" its just like Super Nintendo's RPG battle style (Zelda, Chrono, ect..) Well if you likes RPGs with alot of Cut scenes (with alot of b**ching WHICH REALLY GETS ANOYING!!) and Snes's RPG battle style than go ahead and get this other wise dont waste your time and money.It's not just my opinion.. but it doesnt mean its yours =)"
1,Very Cheap Horse!,"A cheap toy!!! When I received it for my daughter to give her friend as a birthday gift, the leg was ripped! We thought it would be durable and new, but we got a horse with a broken (ripped apart) leg!!"
4,ENTERTAINING AND WORTH IT !!,I LOVE VAMPIRE MOVIES AND MUST SAY THIS WAS WILDLY ENTERTAINING !! I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DUDS LATELY BUT I MUST SAY THIS MOVIE ROCKED AND KEPT MY ATTENTION UNTIL THE END!!
5,Thank GOD,"In a world where the mass consumer culture is driving the now ever-so-idotic vampire craze towards the end of a very dark and smelly toilet with Twilight written in poo at the end, Daybreakers is one giant roll of toilet paper working it's way to wipe up the mess. Although not really advertised for, this movie will definitely blow you away with GORE and real vampires, not ones that sparkle."
3,"Great Premise, Strong Lead Cast, Just Not As Compelling In Execution","Nice twist on the normal vampire story, where in this case, almost everyone around IS a vampire, and society is geared toward vampires, not humans. Makes for a good discussion: what would YOU do if most people were being turned?So, nice premise, and good actors in the lead roles, but the story is only OK, and there is some cheezy dialogue along with the good.Overall, worthwhile to see if you are in the mood for a vampire flick."
1,good idea but . . .,"This movie had promise in the beginning. Unfortunately Ethan Hawke was surrounded by characters that couldn't keep up. Even Willam DeFoe fell flat. Special effects were ok but it seems like the movie production ran out of money and certain scenes got the budget treatment while others didn't. Lastly, were the sponsors of this movie Chrysler and Marlboro because there seemed to be a good chunk of time spent on filming the car as well as everyone smoking. I don't care so much about the smoking but it seemed almost over the top, like Johnny Depp in the Ninth Gate. 1.99 would have been a fair price but 3.99 was too much. More and more these days I find myself content to wait for movies to be available for streaming on netflix."
3,It was ok,The Popular One was ok but not that good. The best love stories books were How To Kiss A Guy and Hard To Resist.
2,This book was kinda boring...!,"It's about a girl,Ebony and she has a twin,Ivory. And she has this huge crush on Charles. But the only problem is that he thinks she is Ivory. Ebony and Ivory switched places and Ebony is starting to fall for Charles.I thought this book was boring. I mean, the beginning just keeps on going and kind of dull. It wasn't really interesting but i was curious for the ending. I recommend just to check this book out from the library."
4,MURS is my best friend.....,"The illest cat from Living Legends hits us with another solid solo joint that is definitley on my list of top ten albums of 2004 so far. 9th absolutley killed it with the beats, and of course MURS drops his usual ill lyrics that'll have you laughing, or thinking, or sometimes both. The whole album is nearly perfect, best cuts being H.U.S.T.L.E., Bad Man, and This Is For. Every head should have this album in his or her collection, not that its an instant classic or anything, but its definitley dope, quality hip hop. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because its way too short, almost like EP short."
5,"The ""illmatic"" of today",Hands down this LP has to be one of the dopest to come out in a long time. His feeling & emotion stands out in every track with great wordplay & story tellin' skills. A++
5,"Explaining the Unexplainable, Deftly","Who among us has not wished to know more about the creation of our universe and the fantastic nature of how we all got here? Who also has not felt his eyes quickly glaze over and wanted to scream ""no mas"" when we actually enlisted the help of a scientific type to try to explain such a complicated topic? Well, Karen Fox has devised the magic bullet to slay such dilemmas with this book! Ms. Fox explains science's most well-known theory with a clarity and deftness that causes the complexities of the matter to be transparent to us curious laymen. With a thorough yet thoroughly readable style that is ceaselessly engaging, Ms. Fox rewards our curiousity by serving up a delectably fun and informative serving of information that goes down easy and causes no heartburn. Whether or not you were able to get past Intro Physics, if you want to know all you should want to know about astronomy's biggest mystery and enjoy doing it, this is the book for you."
1,Super Tuning and Modifying Holley Carburetors,"S-a Design's ""Holley Carburetors"" is great for part numbers and identification. It also is very helpful in the identifying the function of the parts. As far as 'super tuning and modifying', this book is of little or no help. I was unfortunately looking for assistance and found no help here!"
4,Holley Carburetors,Excellent overview of the Holley carbs and the inner workings as well as tuning of the Holley. Would liked to have read more on the performance side.Morgan
1,Completely useless,"I bought this book thinking it would teach me how to super tune and modify a holley carb. It does not. This book includes a history of Holley carbs, some old photos, some weak humor, and that's about it. There is not much tech in this book at all. There are some general, not very accurate, guidelines to follow when selecting a carb for your application (which can all be had for FREE by calling the Holley Tech line), and lots and lots of examples of what NOT TO DO, but that isn't helpful either. However, for someone trying to put together a carbed combination for a street car or a weekend racer, there is next to no useful information in this book, and there is none that isn't available elsewhere. Waste of time. Waste of money.Ironically, there is more useful tech applicable to Holley carbs in ""How to Tune and Win with Demon Carburetors"" by Ray Bohacz that Amazon also sells. I'm not joking, its a good book, even if you have a Holley rather than a Demon."
5,An album to buy,"John Conahan has been compared to the Counting Crows and Peter Gabriel. This album is one of my most prized in my collection. It fits any mood that you can possibly be in. Starting off this album with a power vocal performance, ""Trouble Down in Maryland"" and ""Finding Jenny"" are two songs that immediatly grasp the attention of any listener. This album is the showcase of an extremely talented musician at the early point of his career. Due to release a more mellow second album shortly, this cd is a must for any music lovers constantly growing collection."
4,Sherlock Holmes,"I think this book was very good. It was supensful, and ket me on edge the whole time I was reading. I couldn't put the book down. This book is filled with many suprises that you HAVE to read! I think it is a great book for kids and adults to read!"
3,'s ok,"I got it off a friend with no instructions but it was really easy to start. I played the easy level and i thought i was going to get through it with no problems until i got to a level when i the 'thing' on the skateboard disappeared every time i tried to get a certain deck. I managed it in the end though i think this games fixed or something cos i cant find anyway to control speed and so can never get to the required deck in the given time. Its like running for the bus with a sore leg. You go slower than you think you should be able to and just as you get to the bus stop, the bus pulls out. may be good if you've got good gameboy control. but if your that much of an expert you wont want to play it."
4,"quality criticism, well selected by Bloom","Perhaps the Seattle teacher should learn what the word ""editor"" means: Bloom's role in this series is an EDITOR, not a WRITER. What Bloom does in this, and many other series, is sort through chaff to find the wheat of criticism, and presents it to his readers so that they will have a rounder view of the literature at hand. As always, some of this work is above the heads of all but the finest readers, but in Bloom's collection there is very little of the self-serving nonsense that passes for criticism these days. Kudos to Bloom Brontosaurus!"
1,"A Boring, Silly Rehash","... The author gives an interminable account of the pitiful, repetitious behavior of a spoiled rich teenager who experiments with a plethora of drugs before deciding that OxyContin is her preferred method of self-destruction. Where this uninteresting young woman goes and what she does and whom she buys drugs from is described in sophomoric soap opera prose. The author then somehow decides her plight is really the fault of the company that makes OxyContin and specifically its founder who died nearly a decade before the pain medicine was introduced...."
1,It was nice....for a week,My brothers and I each recieved one of these players for christmas and within 2 weeks ene of them was not working. Then 3 days after that mine stopped working as well. The player would not recognize any disc that I loaded into it. I had no problem with the sound or the screen as others had mentioned though. I have also had a hard time getting customer service on the phone for a RMA. I would not ever buy one of these if I had the choice.
4,String of Pearls a delight that touches the soul,"String of Pearls is a delightful CD! The violin and viola sounds of Carolyn Osborn and Cynthia Morrow truly touch the soul of the listener as they connect the heart with the rest of one's being. I am glad to have found this creatively arranged and orchestrated collection of music. In the aftermath of September 11 and these times of so much uncertainty, fear and doubt, it is uplifting to hear these kinds of serene and calming melodies. I recommend spending an hour with attention focused away from the fear-driven news media, and focused instead on listening to String of Pearls and intending peace for all on our planet."
4,The American Short Story,Good collection of classic short stories; includes a good background of the history of the short story genre.
2,Spanish Peanuts,"I was not sent the correct product as advertised. Therefore, I am not pleased with it. However, I was reimbursed for my purchase, so I am not out any money. As a matter of fact, the picture and description that accompanies this survey request is still incorrect.That said, all-in-all, I am very pleased with the most of my experiences with Amazon.com.Thanks for asking."
5,Keep up the good work...I love Amazon,"Very interesting reading. It tells of many current finds that show, to anyone openminded, that many stories in the Bible are also verifable by know historical writings and acheological fines."
5,every poem is a gem,I have never read a collection of poems so consistantly funny in my life. The pieces included are all very clever and very quote-worthy. I could read the whole thing in a sitting.
3,Disappointing,"This game was a real dissapointment, especially coming from ""The Donald"".I expected a game with more depth, challenge, and closer to the type of assignments that are given on the show. The ""challenges"" were boring and juvenile. Did Mr. Trump play the game himself before giving the OK?"
2,You're Fired!!!,"I purchased The Apprentice computer game after having so much fun and excitement from the Law and Order computer game. However, The Apprentice was just not the same. The ""cheesy"" repetitive quotes from Donald and the others was bad enough, but the entire game lacked the excitement of the television show. There are only three basic ""tasks"" which happen to appear with marginal variation: 1-prepare some kind of food (burgers or spaghetti) 2-unscramble some picture 3-put together a lamp (or toy). And then, the boardroom scene is a word scramble. PLEASE! My cell phone has better games on it than this one! All I have to say to THIS Apprentice Game is ""You're Fired!!!"""
1,Lots of errors,"Well, I started doing the tests at the ends of the chapters. By Chapter 1, question 13, there were three clearly wrong answers. The concepts got more difficult as the book went on, so its hard to tell if there were more wrong answers, but I'm pretty sure I have already found one in the Chapter 2 review test. I'm not sure if I will even continue on to the additional tests."
4,Great collection,"This was a pretty good compilation of essays, both popular and lesser known. Very worthwhile!"
4,strange and disturbing and beautiful,"Thats it. I only read a little german as a Rammstein fan, but I have picked up enough to inspire deeper study. Messer is strange and deeply personal and a little disturbing.And its a great treasure. Its a glimpse into a deep dark well of clear water with something shifting in the bottom. Thought provoking and shocking to say the least!Its rare and I am very happy to have it."
3,Pretty Self-Evident,"Between media and politicians trying to boost their ratings, and drug companies pursuing new sales Americans are constantly barraged by things to be worried about. Recent examples include lack of flu vaccine, SARS, anthrax, West Nile virus, mad cow disease, Social Security bankruptcy, sarin poisoning, etc. This is not to say that we should be fearless - Dr. Siegel suggests concern over accidents, tobacco, alcohol, and obesity are health risks that ought to be taken more seriously, and terrorism involving nuclear suitcase bombs is another. However, the constant attention to seemingly everything is more likely to make one sick (eg. heart attack) than the innumerable worries themselves.Some good basic sense."
2,the real deal,"the first chapter that explains the amygdala over riding the frontal lobes is priceless , but the rest of the book is pablum!"
5,Solid from beginning to end,"The problem with some anthologies is that there is always one or two weak stories in the lot. While I have my faves out of the stories published, none came across as being weak at all. Other reviewers have already chatted about each story in quite a bit of detail so there is no need for me to do so. I will just end this review with, if you like fantasy, horror, undead, magic, romance novels then this is a must have."
3,Disappointing...,"This book was, for me, largely a great disappointment. I had hoped for something much more developed, or at least...sensual, sexy. It wasn't. The plots were, overall, fairly weak, and the romances fell flat. Still, one or two of the stories managed to be somewhat interesting...so it's more like 2.5 stars."
3,Dates from Hell,Short stories are not my usual fare -- good ones leave me wanting more and bad ones aren't worth the effort. The Kim Harrison story in this book is worth the read; the rest are empty calories.
2,Dangerously Stupid!,"My 2-year old loves this video -- we all enjoy the good opening/closing song, lots of train pix, and other little kid characters... BUT! The dialoge is irritatingly cheesey, and the ""Smokey Jones"" character is not only totally hokey, but shows little kids that it's okay for them to go away to ""magic train land"" with a strange man by holding on to his rear end! Who wrote this? Do yourself a favor and stick to ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" and ""Trains: Up Close & Personal"" !"
5,A delightful book that shares a rare intimacy with hummers.,"Hummingbirds : My Winter Guests is a wonderful little book. It is rare to have the opportunity to view hummingbirds so closely over a long period of time. The author conveys the personality of each of her little guests, and educates you about them without reading like a textbook. I fell in love with each of her guests, and was sad as each of them left. My only criticism is that she never finished the story of Peeper. She said that all of her guests eventually left and described each one's leaving, Peeper's healing and leave-taking were not addressed. Since he became my favorite, I still want to know more of what happened to him. I have 2 more of her books to read - I'm saving them for when I need a day of magic, which these books certainly present."
2,wrong tracklist & title,Sounds like a cleaned-up bootleg.This is not the Capitol Theater; it's Woodstock and New Canaan H.S.And the tracklist is 17 songs - completely different from what's listed.For the completist...(sigh) like me.
5,Death Rocks!!!,"The tag line for the movie TRACK 16 says it all, ""Death Rocks.""And so does this soundtrack. What a great accomplishment, especially for a movie shot on a low budget. This masterful CD was obviously cut to accompany the movie in every aspect. Once you get the soundtrack, you'll want to get the movie and vice versa.It's also for anyone who wants a fresh sound and a good mix of rock and blues."
5,"Fantastic device. Bait with a capful of peanut butter, be patient.","This is a Fantastic device. I tried everything from poison, to glue traps, to traps.I baited it with a capful of peanut butter so that the bottom of the device does not get peanut butter on it, place somewhere you can see the LEDs.I have caught 2 NYC sized sewer rats with this thing! I heard them at night but thought they were mice! SO glad to be rid of these pests. I love this device. Once you've trapped a rat/mouse, the led flashes red, Pick it up and dump the rat into the trash outside. No touching the rat, you don't even have to see it!Fantastic, worth every penny I wasted on other traps."
1,Didn't work for me,"This thing appears well made and all, but I think me maybe killed one rat with this thing. On the plus side, it's all enclosed and safe, and you don't have to worry about poisoned rats running off and dieing somewhere else putting children and pets at risk. Guess our rats were just too smart for this thing though. We finally got rid of them by cleaning up all of the bird seed my hubby was throwing around. Sorry birds! We miss you you, but we can't live with those nasty rats!"
1,Not reliable,"My first one didn't work, they sent me a 2nd one, it worked once. I got a 3rd one and it was a remanufactured one and looked it was poorly assembled. I gave up and went back to traps. Too bad, this is a good idea. I used all the tips they gave me to no avail."
1,Doesn't work,"I've had this out for months and we still have rodent's. Initially I put in peanut butter, then cheese, then sausage. Still no deep fried rodent. It's after the return timeframe so I'm out what I paid for it."
5,You have got to get this!,I was a bit skeptical that this could kill the chipmucks that were making a of my equipment. I put this trap out as soon as I got it and the first night; nothing happened. On the second day; it was totally different. I can home from work to find one dead in the trap. Disposed of him and reset the trap and had another one 2 hours later. This thing is awesome. My cat is now out of a job.
1,Mice n car n house n garage,"Well I have a terrible mouse problem. The fields have recently been harvested and whew the mice have sought shelter at my house, garage, and in my car. I rescue dogs from the local animal shelter so the mice have plenty to eat I am sure. So deacon really wasn't an option for me. I watched YouTube videos read the reviews and bought two! I have had them up and running for two months so far only one kill. Very disappointed. Still need a better option...."
1,waste of money,Buying this product is a waste of money! I bought 4=$200. they all malfunctioned after about 3-4 mice. the plate gets dirty and then you get a random blinking light. I had the older version and the most expensive version. thay have not solved the problem. the newer one died even faster. I did not get more than 3-6 months per product.
5,ExCELLENT RESULTS,The Zapper was delivered in quickly and I started using it the following week at our second home on San Juan Island where the rat population is in need of attention. Successful results started the second night the zapper was in place. I like the method of extermination and ease of use. Well done on the design and keep up the good work.
1,Rat zapper zaps nothing,"I bought this product due to other customer reviews stating that within hours your pests would be caught. I've had the rat zapper for over a month now and have not caught one mouse - and yes, we do have mice! Ended up using poisonous bait after all and have been watching the bait disappear. Don't spend your money on this!"
1,Didn't work,Followed instructions and the green light came on showing batteries working. Put food in as suggested. Next day food was gone but nothing found. This happened twice.Agri Zap RZUIR1 Rat Zapper Ultra
2,really smart rats!,"Ok, well this didn't work for me. Not, I think, because it's a bad product, but we apparently have ROUI's (rodents of unusual intelligence) and nothing worked for me - not peanut-butter in snap traps, not a plank to a trash can with dog food in it, not this trap, nothing. I think our only hope is a cat.It might work better if you never touch it - IE use latex gloves while opening the box, loading it and moving it into position.But the bottom line is I tried this trap several times in several locations with several different types of baits and never once did it trigger."
3,i'll buy this one if amazon refunds the price of the first one,"we bought the rat zapper about a year ago for over $40. we catch mice in old-fashioned traps all the time (we live in a very cold climate). in the rat zapper? we've caught ONE. total, in a year's time--ONE. it doesn't work at all, and i keep fresh batteries in it. the mice just walk in, eat the nuts and leave. if amazon will refund my $40, i'll try the ""new ULTRA"" model."
1,rat crap,this product does not even deserve a 1 star. Trap was set many times with different bait caught nothing. The zapper is a complete waste of money and a piece of crap.
4,Needs top of the line batteries,"Haven't used it yet but I tried to buy rechargeable batteries so I could run all the time, won't handle standard rechargeable batteries. mAh of 1800 or so is what I think you need. My rechargeable NiMH are mAh 1000. Red light blinks on full charge because batteries are too weak..."
1,Item was defective out of the box,"The unit is supposed to flash green briefly when turned on, but the one I received flashed red rapidly. According to the directions, this indicates that the batteries need to be replaced. However, but I tried two new, unopened 4-packs of D cell alkaline batteries. Perhaps I got the rare bad unit."
5,It works!,"My daughter kept borrowing my Rat Zapper so I got her one for Christmas, she wanted it early. A couple of pieces of dog food inside, a bright red light on top if there is a dead mouse inside. If a mouse gets the kibble and doesn't get zapped, a damp paper towel at the entrance gets their little feet wet so the zapper works. Seldom need that. Worth the money."
4,Really blasts your pests,"My first success with this was in my shed: I had moved some boards and found that something had dragged in a whole bunch of tomatoes from my garden (thieves!), so I baited this bad boy with tomatoes and put it in place. I thought that since the green LED is VERY bright, I would easily spot the telltale red blinking in a half-hidden location, but that might not have been the case. All I dumped out of the rat zapper after a while was a rat skeleton and some fluff.Until I loaned it out to a friend, I figured that I had just left a dead rat too long, but he told of a similar result with very frequent checks. So it seems that your friends get pretty thoroughly fried in the rat zapper, and that is just fine with me!"
2,"I'd give it one star, but it did kill one mouse....","I've been using it for a month now, near my chicken coop in two different spots, baited with both dog food and chicken scratch (both of which I know these rats LOVE) and NOTHING. nada. No kills, except one lowly little mouse. I am sooooo disappointed. Now that I'm on my second set of 4 D batteries (hello??? two years of battery stand by power, or up to 50 kills? Apparently NOT!) I have given up and bought poison. It's a great idea, and I really thought it would work. Oh well :("
1,Rats!,"It work the first time. Then the other times, the mouse/mice took the bait and left droppings but no body. Waist of money! Agri Zap Rat Zapper Ultra zapped my wallet!"
1,Overpriced,Stick with the standard rat traps. They did not come up with a better rat trap. This trap did not catch anything.
3,Great for chipmunk control,"I've got this trap to control the squirrel population in my backyard since these critters ended up eating all my flower bulbs & strawberries. I've baited it with bread, peanut butter and grapes, and got about five chipmunks in it within the first week - but no squirrels.Some days, the trap was overturned or moved by a foot or so, so I have a feeling that the squirrels got zapped, but escaped easily. Hence, I'm thinking that there's not enough juice in this device to properly kill/stun them and they get to escape and don't touch it ever again.However, if mice or chipmunks are what you're after, then it works great."
3,Jury not out yet...,"I ordered one of these and was looking forward to exterminating the little critters, but....The unit arrived in great condition, added the batteries and off it went. However, every morning the bait was missing with no rodent. I called Agrizap and spoke to Cathi who was very helpful and nice. We corresponded via email for a couple of weeks with her sending me tips and spark instructions. The unit produced the spark/charge very well so I continued a couple of more weeks with no success. I am returning the unit for a new one. My suspicion is that the infrared detection is not picking up the presence of a mouse, although the electrocution works fine. I will reevaluate the new one and update my comments. Right now, it looks like its backordered, since it says I will receive in August. I would love to give this thing 5 stars, and will if it works as it should. Stay tuned."
5,Something definatly wicked in this CD,"I would go as far as to say it is Iced Earth's best album. There is a lot of range in the songs from speed to power to ballads. ""Watching Over Me"" and Melancholy are the best songs, however the whole CD is good. If you are new to bands like Iced Earth, Blind Guardian, Demons and Wizards, and Helloween, then this is a good choice to begin a power metal collection."
5,Iced Earth are the real deal,"This is one of the greatest metal albums ever made. The riffs are classic, the vocals are passionate, and it all blends together to create the perfect sound. This band is a vision of what heavy metal should be. The whole album is a masterpiece, however, if I had to pick out a bright spot, it would be the ending trilogy. ""Prophecy"", ""Birth of the Wicked"", and ""The Coming Curse"" rock hard and show a songwriting ability that most metal bands lack. Something Wicked This Way Comes is a must-have for any metalhead."
1,Boring,"When I litened to clips of this album and read reviews here on Amazon I thought Iced Earth might be my next favorite band. I finally bought the cd. There seems to be a pattern of tracks The 1st song is heavy the next is a ballad, heavy, ballad, heavy ballad, and so on for the rest of the album. At first I liked some of the songs but then they quickly got old due to the simple song structures. Every song is the same verse, chorus, verse, chorus. Then I got sick of it and never listened to it again. This cd sucks! Sure it's true heavy metal and they have a good vocalist but if you want good power metal listen to Blind Guardian."
4,Stayed hard unlike so many metal groups today...,"I really like this cd, It took me a few listens to get really into it. Once inside I found the complexed music writing style of Jon Schaffer and the unbelivable vocals of Matthew Barlow. The whole cd is great and the bonus track is awesome. If you liked the other cd's you'll love this one as well. Don't miss it!!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product relying solely on the reviews I had read. I haven't used it long enough to tell if it truly helps extend the life and vibrancy of my haircolor. I do know that I will never purchase this shampoo & conditioner again. It is extremely over priced and after using it my hair still feels like before I washed and conditioned it, dry straw!! Pantene Brunette Expressions shampoo & conditioner works much better and cost a lot less!"
1,A Big Miss By Miss Eder,"There is a reason, a very good reason, why no one has attempted a tribute album to Judy Garland in the thirty-six years since her death. That reason, simply, is that, compared to Judy, no one's voice can handle the material properly. As much as I love Linda Eder's music, I found it extremely difficult to sit though this album once... and I highly doubt a second listen will be in order any time soon. Sorry Linda."
2,Does not hit the mark,"Linda Eder is my favorite but as much as it saddens me thiseffort does not hit the mark. Her arrangements lack the emotional high and the deseperation of Judy Garland. Her voice sounds dead and lifeless, maybe it was too soon after the divorce from Frank but it is just not there in this work. I so wanted to love the cd but Eder should stick to new music written for or arrangements that showcase the amazing timber of her voice. In all honesty, this is the first cd of hers that I have not loved the first time I played it. Usually her cds stay in my player for a month after I purchase them but this one I listened to one and stored it away. I will try to listen to it again at some point but not in the near future!"
3,hmmm you think so huh?,"Don't be fooled my brother. It's not 99.9% preventative. It's good if you do the withdrawl method consistantly, but once you bust inside, it's over. It's @ 75%, so 15 out of 100 women get pregnant if you use it by itself."
5,I knew the author when----,I knew Roger before he became a writer and was just a great fisherman and tyer. His wife was my next-door neighbor in Westkill and I took her on her first fly fishing outing!The book is very good! I have read it several times and have managed to now misplace it so I am ordering another one!Enjoy--it's worth the read!
5,Spiritual resources,"I always welcome spiritual resources on grief. This one is a valuable addition to my stack of books. I also am using Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal as part of a class that I am teaching. This is a memory journal filled with verses and daily prompts. For the children I work with I show the video, After the Tears, A Gentle Guide to Help Children Understand Death."
2,Hardly an expert,"I agree with the other ""thumbs down"" reviewers. This book is full of old info. and I detest its incessant cutesy girl talk demeanor. Frankly, I was shocked that Gavin de Becker endorsed this book. Safety Chick has great PR. That's the main thing I can say she has going for her, at least in terms of this book.Moreover, taking a few self defense lessons from a self defense pro hardly qualifies one as an expert. Some of her information, particularly regarding self defense, is downright dangerous and shallow - clearly the mark of someone with little experience.If you want good information on safety and self defense, read Sanford Strong's ""Strong On Defense."" I also recommend Gavin de Becker's book ""The Gift of Fear."" If you want to learn practical self defense and rape defense tactics for women, check out the Dr. Ruthless videos - Fierce and Female."
3,Inconsistent live recital,"After enjoying Montero's 1998 Chopin recital on Palexa, I got ahold of her earlier live recording (contrary to Amazon the all- Chopin disc is a studio recording). This CD is a less consistent in my opinion, like many live recitals. The piano is also a little plummy sounding, though the ear quickly adjusts. The Chopin noctures are wonderful, but the two Polonaises sound a little heavy handed. The Rachmaninoff is wonderful. I especially liked the Sonata performance--powerful and well controlled. The Liszt Rigoletto paraphrase is also beautifully judged. Enjoyable, but I sense quite a bit of growth in this artist between this and her second CD. If forced to choose, I'd opt for the all-Chopin recital."
1,This is a disappointment.,"Run, do not walk to avoid this product.What a disappointment.If I could return it, I would."
3,I wish the picture quality was in HD...,"It a must have if you're a hardcore Laker fan! Also, the price is not bad than what it was originally was for. But I expected an HD quality when I bought this bluray version, but unfortunately it's like popping in a DVD version; not very sharp and clear. The picture quality is just ok, now I know why they lower the price to $39."
2,questionable,"No sale or shipping slip enclosed with this item, not as good as it appears by add and it looked like it was either very old or used and retrurned. No manufactuer name on the item or packing."
2,Not enough information,"The product information does not tell you how many blades come with it. Other sellers do, and they come with 2 or 3 additional blades. Also, it costs less. The only difference is that theirs is clear and this one is white."
5,Good practical advice,This book lays out in clear concise language what needs to happen for you to plant a church. For the new planter it is a must read.
1,Sad,"Sam's book illuminates why Air America is a failure and why the Left and Liberalism is dieng in America. Thank God! The only followers they have ""left"" are the mentally ill and drug addicted. This book was too poorly written and amaturish to be interesting. Cheap attempts at humor and thoughtless ranting and hysteria. Pretty typical for democrats these days. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Complete First National Band Recordings by Michael Nesmith,"Of the first of two discs, the only good song on disc 1 is ""Joanne"" but the song is so beautiful that I haven't even listered to the second disc"
2,False Advertising,"Parents, do not make the same mistake we did. The picture of this tool bench that Amazon provides fails to mention anywhere that the Elmo drill below the table IS NOT INCLUDED in the product. This drill was a large part of why we bought the dang thing to begin with, as our toddler is obsessed with his dad's drill. However, in miniscule writing on the actual box (not the Amazon photoshopped picture, mind you), it tells you (after you've forked out money online for it) that the drill is not included.Thanks for telling us, Amazon. Merry Christmas to you, too."
4,son cant get enough,"he loves the tools and goes around ""fixing"" things with them. customer service is awsome about replacing lost parts."
2,Too basic.,"This book has inspiring case studies about companies marketing over the internet, but the rules and practices described are too general. All her instructions are common sense practices learned in college marketing classes. You could substitute the word ""e-commerce"" throughout the book with many other marketing channels and the advice wouldn't be much different.Also--the writing style is distracting. There are too many exclamation points and question marks on each page. It creates a false set of excitement for trite points. Disappointing."
2,A prime candidate for Cliff Notes,"Contains some interesting points but nothing earth-shattering. A boring read, with case studies filtered through the author's gimmicks - ""8 Key Success Factors"", ""Five Essential..."", ""Patty's Rx"" and so forth. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library."
5,Quite Amazing!,"This book was referred to my by the author of ""101 Ways to Boost Your Web Traffic"". I was skeptical at first because of the publication date. Most Internet books written in 1998 are out dated now. However, to my pleasant surprise, I find that Customer.com is still very applicable. It actually teaches me a number of good ways to improve my Internet business. I can also see the principles being used at successful Web sites, such as Amazon.com and Dell Computer. Excellent work."
5,The best pie cookbook ever,"This pie cookbook has techniques and recipes for everone from the beginning pie baker to the most experienced. The fruit pies cannot be beat, and the main dish pies are very good. Best of all is the section on crusts - different types, and how to produce a great-looking and great-tasting pie.My copy of this book is over 20-years old. If there is ever a fire, I'm saving the Farm Journal pie cookbook."
4,The Rules for Women,"As a former co-host of MTV's Loveline, Diane Farr has the qualifications to dish out helpful and amusing advice on the opposite sex. In this book, she manages to convey lively and clever tidbits of information about relationships and advice for women on how to play the game. Very cute book, although it was a little less substantial than I would have liked, but still a great little read for the plane or poolside."
5,Perfect for my needs,"Got this set to open up my cartridge games and video game systems and for that it works great. Not sure if these would stand up against heavy duty work, but for my purpose they are great."
3,"A good read a bit bloated,preachy and inconsistent.","At 880 pages it feels somehow bloated, I bought this book and I usually buy some sci-fi for outlandish premises with enough credibility to pull me into another world for a couple of hours.In The Swarm the sea turns angry against humans and tries to destroy earth as we know it. What makes it a good read is finding out the details of this; even the mayor twists are interesting.I personally didn't like the religious tones, as well as the little personal stories happening every now and then, as for sci-fi it makes sense, but not as a drama/thriller, it's full of clichés and stupid character moments.Still, If you like the premise, it's well worth the hefty, hasty read."
3,Interesting but not original,"The book had an interesting premise, but not too original. The author even cites some of the movies that he borrows from, namely, the Abyss and Contact. I probably would have rated it higher (maybe 4 stars) but the fact that this book was just shy of 900 pages and didn't really deliver annoyed me."
1,"Someone Forgot to Proofread ""The Swarm""","I was anxious to read ""the Swarm"" after a German friend raved about it and told me how popular it had been in Germany. Was astonished to discover numerous grammatical errors in this book, enough so that after 50 pages I could go no further. I even contacted the publisher to tell them about all the mistakes in the book and got no return call. Curious if anyone else has noticed these problems, and if the publisher plans to reprint this book with corrections made. Someone did a terrible job of proofreading this book, if they did it at all."
3,An interesting read that fails in many ways...,"This is a difficult book to review because it is essentially two books in one. There is an interesting story with unique characters and some memorable set pieces. Unfortunately the author goes on long tangents about marine life and technology without warning. It seemed like whenever things were getting interesting the story would abruptly stop. The sad part is that not all the facts presented here are true, and the author spends the bulk of the book throwing fact after fact at the reader. Honestly, any reader would be better off buying a biology textbook and some other fiction novel of their choosing. I think if you were to cut out the textbook like narrative this book would only be about two hundred pages."
1,"Interesting idea, but WAY too introspective","I really liked the first quarter of this book (English translation), plus the descriptive passages of the ""leviathan alien"". But the rest of the novel is too psychological / introspective / metaphysical for me. There is very little action.Certain events are described, which then are subjected to much analysis:""Did it really happen? Or, if not what do I think I saw?""The main character reads various historical books on Solaris. Some of the descriptions of these passages go on for pages and pages - way TOO long in my opinion.In a nutshell, I was totally bored by the halfway point. I forced myself to keep reading, but did not enjoy the rest of this book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A novel about really different aliens, and the struggles that the human psyche has in dealing with such concepts.A psychologist is dispatched to a station on an alien world to see what is going on, and finds murder and a host of mental problems when he arrives."
5,Deep,"I'd seen Tarkovsky's movie version of Solaris five times before I read Lem's novel. I enjoyed the book including the speculations of the Solarists on the nature of the ocean and also the inquiry into the amazing experiences with the ocean of the pilot Berton. The feeble efforts of the Solarists match what my efforts have been to grasp this book and Tarkovsky's movie. Perhaps Solaris leaves me feeling as Kris with Solaris' Rheya, quite out of my element but glad to be have arrived at this book.Despite all the visual power of Tarkovsky's movie, there is still an extraordinary power of the word that Lem uses to invite us into his head: accepting that invitation turns out to have been an experience similar to Rheya's effort to go thru the door without realizing how best to open it. Hopefully our recovery powers can match hers."
5,Tasty and Nourishing Brain Candy,"Quite possibly the best sci-fi novel ever written, Solaris goes deeper in its [too brief!] 200 pages than the entire output of just about any other toiler in this generally mediocre genre.It's a novel of ideas, and those ideas are as box-fresh right now as they were back in the day. Unlike most other sci-fi practitioners, Lem is never explicit about his dream technologies, and the science in his fiction is completely believable. Thus we are spared the laughably dated flights of fancy that occasionally pop up in the otherwise wonderful work of, say, Phil Dick or Alfred Bester (atomic teletypes, anyone?). And while the book is indeed a heavy piece of speculative genius, Lem's descriptive powers are truly awe-inspiring; the intricately detailed passages describing the various forms and structures generated by Solaris' living ocean are nothing short of psychedelic.Buy it, read it, savor it. Truly an amazing trip."
4,I Only Read The English Version,"I thought the wording rather poetic even if a little intellectually verbose, despite those who read versions in other languages. (After all, how many Americans who aren't scientists use words like oleaginous, colloidal, or calyx?) This probably stems from a combination of factors, a) those who interpret books are exceedingly intellectual and assume that their readers are likewise, and b) this particular text has at least two sections which are heavy on scientific explanations.On the other hand, the story remains sound thoughout and is as meaningful to read today as it was when it was written. This book could be a classic sci-fi in any language."
2,Very technical,"If you love sci-fi and love in depth, long explanations that detail just how everything in the author's world works, I would recommend this book. If you are more of a phillip k dick sci-fi fan like i am, I would not recommend this book. The story dragged on too long for me to add more stars."
2,weak script and over-acting,"Wow.. I just finished watching this and I must say, I just am really unsatisfied that I wasted all the time I took to watch this movie. The script was weak.. the lines were hokey and unmoving, though over-acted for drama and forced pain. The kid from the 50's that goes missing was poorly acted. Lots of continuity errors in hair, dress, actions, photos. I guess if you'd never lived in the 50's/60's, you'd never think of this stuff, but it ruined it for me in the flash-backs. Even the abductions/killings made no sense at all and they even tried to play a Silence of the Lambs thing with the killer getting into the detective's head until he hits him. I can't believe it was so well reviewed here on amazon."
1,"Bland, Uneven and a Waste of Time","This film fails to deliver on any level & the film felt like basic cable tv fare. The Script was uneven (especially in the flashbacks), it was predictable early on, and very flat performances. Some of the characters were either annoying or just acting to get a paycheck.. And John Hamm as a detective looking for his long lost son by going in and beating up everyone he questions was weird...I seriously don't reccommend this movie. But if you love Lifetime movies or need soething to fall asleep to, be sure to catch this & you'll be out within 10 minutes....."
3,Average,An average murder thriller with 2 parallel stories. The pace is slow and acting is just ok. Can watch once if there is nothing else to do.
5,Easy-to-make artistic & elegant cards,"I was very impressed by the artistry and sophistication of the designs in this book. They are definitely elegant, not cutesy or country, yet easy to make using simple tools and materials.There are 13 complete projects including collage, printed, fold-out and photo holder cards. Each of these will lend itself to many more varieties depending on the paper and embellishments used. There are excellent step-by-step instructions accompanied by full-color photos making assembly a breeze. Some, like the potato print card, would be great projects to do with a child. Additional sections include making your own envelopes and paper, and eight pages of paper samples.If you are looking for beautiful cards that are simple to create and that will impress your friends and family, this is the book to get. It is also a great addition to any rubber stamper's library because the structures in these projects adapt easily to decorative stamping."
1,retarted clips,very obnoxious design - clips are difficult to get on the sheets and they dont stay - they slip right off the min you put them under matters so you have to attempt to start all over again - very frustrating
1,Pop Off,"After much trouble getting these thing on, they pop off after one or two nights. These should be made with metal grippers."
1,Useful but low quality,"The ideia is good, but the quality of the product could be better. Some pieces I receive arrive with red corrosion, making them unuseable."
2,sheet and thin blanket holders,"This was to keep the blankets on my 100 -year old bed frame from coming loose at night as they can't be tucked in. I find it fine on thin sheets, but very hard to fasten on thick blankets."
1,Cheap,"Although these things were dirt cheap(definite clue), I at least expected to be able to see how well they worked or not(Not). Since both the gripper parts are Plastic/Rubber they are almost impossible to hook together. It took me a LONG time to try & try & try to hook them together & when I finally did, they would pop right off. TERRIBLE!! So...another lesson of ""You get what you pay for"". Go for a more expensive set(The shipping was more than the cost of this product-another clue) and don't waste the time or energy messing with these things!"
1,dont buy,The product is very flimsey did not work at all broke as soon as I tryed to put the first one on. Then tryed second one and wouldn't hold to sheets in little clips. This sucks don't buy
1,Horrible,These were horrible. I tried to put them on my bed and they immediately broke. I never got to use them. Please do not buy this product.
2,not what i expected,They are durable but a little hard to use and they came undone on the 2nd night. I like the concept i just wish they stayed better.
3,Good stuff,Quick seller.Cd is very good but the box was broken.Anyway I can say everything is good and the sound is nice.
3,Introduction to the owrld of phones,Had to read this to get a handle on new responsibilities at my company. I found this book to be full of information but the writing style is both dry and scattered. If it were put into a better format (easier to absorb) I am sure it would be much better.
5,Best Binders,"These Avery binders are my favorite. They have the ring mechanism on the back of the binder instead of on the spine so my pages don't get all jenky when I open and close it. These are the best binders in the world, and they're so inexpensive on Amazon. I buy multitudes of them on here and get free shipping and handling. This saves me money on the actual binders themselves and on driving to place ""X"" to buy them. BEST EVER!!!"
2,Safecracker gliches,"The concept of the game is great. I am still trying to finish it. I have downloaded a patch, but still lose my inventory on the middle screens. This is frustrating. Hopefully Dreamcatchers will be able to help me and I can finish it. Knowing that you have a time limit gives the game a different twist from others. I am looking forward to beating the time if I can proceed past the glich."
3,Great reference book,"I am an Environmental Scientist, living and working in Florida now, but was never formally educated here. I bought this book, recommended by a co-worker. It has proven to be a great learning tool. It contains historical information, along with a wide range of information about geology, geography, soils, climate and more current human influences on the ecosystems of Florida."
2,Terrible condition,"Great product, but I don't recommend to buy from this seller. The condition was terrible, and it wasn't carefully packed. I guess that's why it's a lot cheaper than other places."
4,Happyness,"In respone to the comment by K. Biro ""Puzzled"", the spelling of ""Happyness"" is purposeful because it is supposed to be in reference to how Chris Gardner saw the word spelled on a bathroom stall in a subway station he slept in(correct me anyone if I'm wrong). Otherwise, it's such a great story to read that shows the endurance of the human spirit. The trailer to the motion picture featuring Will Smith was only 2 minutes long and had me in tears."
5,Great Book!,A very nice read. inspirational motivational very touching experience some people would never think that someone actually have gone through this much of pain and hurt specially with a child to take care of.
3,Chris Gardner Keeps It Real,"""The book is better"", you hear that about most films based on novels. In my opinion the book and the movie balanced each other reasonably well. Im partly glad that certain parts of the book were streamlined and adjusted for cinematics. That left for pleasant, and not so pleasant surprises upon reading the true story.Gardner held nothing back, from the humility of his manhood being taken at a young age to his own infedility in marriage. I didnt read the book in hopes of finding a new hero so his morals or lack thereof dont concern me as much as his determination to overcome obstacles.I found inspiration and relativity in his life story. If he could survive and succeed the obstacles stated, in my own humanity...then so can I."
3,The Pursuit of Happyness,"This book was an interesting book to read. I really enjoyed reading about how Chris Gardner succeeded despite his many challenges. The only thing I did not like about it was the graphic language and sex scenes that were used in the book. I got the book to give to my Father-in-law for Christmas, but ended up not giving it to him due to these two factors."
4,Nevereach aero hydration system is very good,I read another review with disgust and had to post my experience. This system is the most aero I have used and no trickier to set up than any of the others.You always have to spend time making the set-up work best for your particular bike as they are all a bit different.I used a little duct tape and a little wire in places to provide additional security in case a screw came loose. So far a screw has not come loose and the bottle is very secure.If you can change an inner tube you probably have enough know-how to set up this system. Suits my bike fine (QR CD0.1 with Selle SMP saddle).The drink tube works fine and seems much the same as the Speedfill system which I used to use.
4,"Ed, Edd, 'N Eddy:The Mis-Edventures",This game is quick and easy to play while being faithfull to the nonsensical cartoon.
5,Not only against human attackers,Fortunately I hasn't been necessary to use it against a human mugger but it worked marvelously when a dog attacked me while I was riding my bike.
1,bad product bad service,"I have the same problem. So, I sent it back to Reebok 4 months ago. I did not get any response until now, It is not just a bad product, also bad after service."
5,Match Listing,Unforgiven 1998-Inferno MatchKane vs. UndertakerUnforgiven 2003-Last Man Standing MatchKane vs. Shane McMahonSummerSlam 2004-Til Death Do Us Part MatchKane vs. Matt HardyUnforgiven 2004-No DQ MatchKane vs. Shawn MichaelsVengeance 2005Kane vs. Edge
3,Kane in the Ring,"For fans simply looking for a collection of matches - and no extras - the five-match set featuring Kane may be the way to go.Taken from 1998-2005, there are three bouts from Unforgiven - 1998 w/ Undertaker, 2003 w/ Shane McMahon, 2004 w/ Shawn Michaels - and one each from SummerSlam (2004 w/ Matt Hardy) and Vengeance (2005 w/ Edge). The latter pair are with a then major storyline surrounding Lita. The highlight is the Inferno Match versus the Undertaker, which can be appreciated without knowing the back story of the ""half-brothers.""Like a quality house show, the emphasis is on the work-rate inside the ring, minus the nonsense of the soap opera drama."
5,Everyone considering serving in the armed forces should read,"Having read ""I Refuse"" was a mother's dream-come-true. Every so often, while reading, you get a glimpse of something in which God had to channel through the author--such was the case in ""life is a gift we nurture in harmony with all God's creations. Opposite is war. The sin is pride--We believe ourselves in charge of life."" If ever they consider all the hours mom spends in raising sons--they might ask mom, ""do you mind if your son is used for war?"" In this case, the book's author would be a mom's dream come true. Great Book!!! Well written, and not too much drama--just a casual, self-assurance that rejecting to be used as part of the governmental war machine is just the right thing to do. I would require it as a high school textbook--it could prove to be a massive life saver."
1,"Authoritative, Unbiased...? NOT!","I have searched for a straightforward, clear cut explanation of the world's major religions. Like many people, I tend to give weight to prestigious names like ""Oxford"" mistakenly believing that the name lends credibility and accuracy to the product.I am by no means a Holy Roller. I have problems with Christianity myself, but the anti-Christian rhetoric in the book is inescapable and vile. The author undoubtedly has an agenda and it's not to present a well balanced, unopinionated view of faiths in the world."
1,100% pure garbage,"So, I was on my THIRD one of these two days ago when this too broke. These things work just great for a little while, or if you rarely if ever need to actually pull the chain from the housing.However, it does not stand up to multiple extensions and retractions on a daily basis. This thing is cheap, Chinese-made, junk."
1,Painful,"My partner and I both experienced excruciating allergic reactions to this product. It felt ok initially, but as soon as orgasm hit, extreme burning sensation. I wish there were something other than nonoxynol-9 for spermicide. I'm somewhat familiar with this allergic reaction, unfortunately, but it was new for partner and was in so much pain it was hours before he could urinate..after calling the doctor and following doctor's advice. The packaging seems to acknowledge that a reaction can happen, but says only to ""discontinue use"". It says nothing about how to treat the symptoms! (He used Benadryl, ibuprofen for anti-inflammatory, and soaked in the bath a little while..was still painful but at least he was able to pee then, and was feeling better the next day or two).Aside from that, it's not pleasant dealing with the mess as it melts and leaks out all over. I plan on taking them up on their money-back guarantee, as there's no way we're touching this stuff again."
1,"Correctly titled the mis-edventures, they really missed on this one","Poor graphics, the Eds look really ill. Totally boring, no plotline, only 3 or 4 characters actually talk, and then won't shut up once they do. Missions are close to impossible to beat, to much interference. Don't waste your money buying this, rent it."
2,Take a class using this book--it'll be easier!,"I bought this book believing that making a kaleidoscope quilt would be easy to do. For people who can learn by books only--and don't need a teacher to help you figure this out--then it's okay.My quilt shop owner advised me to take the class she had for making kaleidoscope quilts, and I didn't listen to her. I went home and tackled it myself. Now I have a bunch of fabric cut up and some of it doesn't match properly at the points, which is one of the keys to getting the kaleidoscope effect. So, I won't get the kaleidoscope quilt I wanted. If I had taken the class, my instructor probably would have caught my mistakes.**This book has errors and you *should* be able to get a page from your local quilt shop with the corrections.**"
2,I'm still seeking to learn to fussy cut Lemoyne stars,"I am frustrated with this book. I find the directions confusing and unclear. Also, I don't want to copy exactly any of the author's quilts and am having trouble translating her instructions to the size and layout I want. For one thing I'm having trouble using her charts to figure how much material to buy.I'd previously purchased Stars by Magic by Nancy Johnson-Srebbro and readily learned to make eight pointed stars. Now I want to fussy cut them. I think that I need a class as this book alone does not do it for me."
2,Stack n Whack,I found the instructions to be difficult to follow. The pictures of the finished product were beautiful. However making them wasn't as easy. I tried making the Hexagon Double Quilt. Finding out how to cut the fabric took me 2 hours to figure it out. I'm sorry just too hard to follow!
3,Not good at titles for reviews,"Product did arrive and was in readable condition. I choose this company because they had a good price and promised that it was new. It was NOT NEW. First clue was when a paper showing someone else's pattern choices, then found writing on the pages. Might not order from this company again."
2,Stacking and Whacking is debasing good and proper piecing,"Ms. Reynolds grossly overstates the simplicity of ""Stacking and Whacking"". She further does herself and her readers a disservice by debasing a tried and true technique, template guided piecing, which she claims is greatly more difficult and longer than her inaccurate approaches. Buying a book for $ 20 and a clumsy ruler for guidance, is hardly simpler than the correct, precise tool-a good template."
3,Very Firm Pillow,"Pros: The pillow is very well made with high quality material.Cons: Because of my neck pain, I was hoping for that the named ""Stress Ease"" implied that it was softer & gentler on the neck. This pillow, however, is not soft or flexible; it is very firm! Also, the ""cradle"" portion in the middle of the pillow is very large, so the pillow doesn't really ""cradle"" your head in place (at least not mine!)."
2,Not that stron in compare w/ part 2,"1st I bought part 2 which was realy a good one then i decided to get part 1, in fact I found part 1 not that interesting ...!"
4,Interesting 20 years later...,"Having worked at Kennedy on Apollo, I eagerly checked this book out of the library when I saw it listed.It is very interesting to read what the moonwalkers thought 20 years ago and now 40-ish years after their flights. Their predictions of the promise of shuttle flights, Mars missions, space station operations and return missions to the moon are fascinating. I liked the question and answer format.As mentioned elsewhere, there are way too many typos and it is obvious that it was transcribed from audio tapes by somebody not very familiar with the space program. On the plus side, only a few technical errors."
5,Xlint quality at a fair price,"My son and i each got a pair of these to workout on a heavy bag. They are very good - no complaints. I have never used any other gloves so I have no point of reference, but these have held up well and have good padding. I only use them about 5 minutes, 2 or 3 times a week - that is more of a workout then it sounds. Perhaps if you were a real boxer, you might want heavier duty, better quality gloves."
3,Irish Soap Opera with familial tilt,"The Cripple of Inishman was, by far, the more preferable of Mr. MaDonagh's words. This interesting parable about a fortish plain Jane, her domineering mother and a milquetoast gentleman caller harkens more Tennesse Williams than James Joyce. Still, some moments have sheer intensity and the characters are richly defined to the point of complete empathy at the plays closing moments. Haven't seen the Broadway production, but was very pleased ""Art"" took home the Tony for Best Play as that has characters as complete and an object of conflict as well, but was much less drifting in it's own drama."
3,not tight enough,this cover looks and fits good but it doesn't tighten up enough on the draw strings to keep it coming off in the local automatic car wash.
4,spare tire cover,Very cheap compared to other sources. Easy to put on and off. Lasts about 2 years (unless it gets stolen).
1,Blurry,"The glasses look nice and fit well, but the lens is blurry. Can't tell by looking at it, but when I put them on, everything is slightly blurry with some spatial distortions. I figured maybe it's dirty and coated with oil, so I washed them. They are now squeaky clean, but the blurriness hasn't gone away."
4,very wholesome!,"...was actually very enjoyable for me, but was devoured four times over by my 11-year-old daughter! And I am so glad she devoured it because the human interactions in the book teach so much.I really enjoyed the way the author creates a family atmosphere, complete with humor and sometimes disagreements and cookies burning, etc.Also, a great introduction to boys for girls!...and would also be a great introduction to girls for boys if the boys could enjoy reading it at 11 years old. Come on guys, you might enjoy it! They have to flag a bull in the pasture!"
3,Does not rank with the classics,"I read this to my daughter after I introduced her to the classics of my childhood, like the Melendy books by Elizabeth Enright. Despite the hype, this is not in the same league. It did not create the same rich world. I found some things about the book to be odd. The father is so checked out that he did not seem like an engaging absent minded professor. I was creeped out by the extent to which the oldest daughter was a surrogate mother. For those of you who read the Four Story Mistake and other Melendy books, you will not find the same richly imagined world. The villainous mother and boyfriend of their neighbor were too creepy and unrealistic.Reread the Melendy books or the Gone Away Lake books--and if you haven't read them, buy them instead!"
5,A Rollicking Delight!,"I'll just say up front that I am a big Penderwicks fan. Maybe because I come from a family with four sisters, but I can relate well to the trials and tribulations that Rosalind, Skye, Jane, and Batty experience. I highly recommend this series to those who like realistic stories about the adventures of growing up."
3,"Great Book, Unsatisfying Ending","I absolutely loved this book, but I found that the ending was very unsatisfying. It seemed to end so suddenly and not even one of the characters seemed to have a pleasing ending. A sequel might clear up the somewhat confusing ending."
5,The Penderwicks,"I loved this book . Its perfect for children ages 7 to 12. I knew that the first time I read this book,it wasn't going to be the last time I read it."
4,The Penderwicks,"With its Latin-speaking father, spunky children and old-fashioned adventures, this book feels as if it could have been written 50 years ago. It's literary and insightful, and treats the subjects with dignity, something children will recognize and delight in. I would highly recommend it for any family bookshelf, though parents ought to know that there is some unrequited pining by one of the sisters and some other topics that may be confusing to very young readers, though not wholly inappropriate. Considering this is Birdsall's first novel, I am delighted to see what else she churns out. There's another Penderwick novel written, and three more planned, and I can't wait to see what adventures Rosalind, Skye, Jane and Batty get into!"
5,Amazing,I am very pleased with this machete. I bought the matching sheath and have not had any issues whatsoever so far. It retains an edge very well.
4,Well made,"This machete has survived many camping trips and seems to be ready for many more. It's a bit heavy for backpacking (intended purpose), but the quality makes up for the extra weight. The steel is of good quality and the black (powder?) coating has a couple of sap stains but no wear-throughs.I needed a machete (beats stuff down, makes paths) and not a sword (cuts through stuff). That said it does a fair job of cutting. I've never sharpened it past how it came, but it looks like the steel would hold a wicked edge if you so chose."
3,Solid as a rock,"This machete is the best constructed machete in this style that is that I have ever come across. It is very thick and extremely sturdy. 1095 High carbon steel. This thing feels like it well never break. I have used it extensively since i purchased it and it has held up great. The only cons to it, and depending what you are looking for can be big cons are: it arrives to you with sharpness less than that of a butter knife. I mean this thing had no edge at all. It took me a good hour to put a solid edge on this blade, and I have own a ton of knives, machetes, hatchets etc... basically I'm an active outdoors man. I know how to sharpen a blade and it took a while. The other con is the handle. It is uncomfortable. Very squared off and slippery. Overall though, you won't find a stronger and well built machete, after a sharpening and wrapping of the handle (I used hockey tape) this thing is unbeatable."
3,Helpful resources,"As one who suffers from depression as well as anxiety, resources to books and web sites are very important. This resourceful book is divided into three major parts: ""Adult Depression"", ""Adult Anxiety/Panic"" and ""Depression & Anxiety in Children & Teens"". Furthermore, the depression section also covers bipolar disorder, postpartum depression, seasonal affective disorder, and suicide. The division and sub-divisions make your research easy without frustration. The reason for only 3 stars is that the listed books weren't as updated as I wanted them to be. Regardless, I found a couple of very informative and helpful web sites from this book."
5,All Around Winner,"For my taste, Hold to a Dream is this line-up's best and most consistent effort. John Cowan's vocals became increasingly ""dramatic"" (bordering upon histrionic at times) on subsequent releases and stylistically, those records became somewhat of a hodgepodge, as well. There are plenty of songs I like on the later albums, but there are also plenty I skip over. Also, for my taste, some of the songs on the later albums are a bit too commercial, a direction Bela Fleck, for one, seemed to rebel against. No such ""complicatins"" plague this album, happily; I find it to be pure pleasure from start to finish. And it's emotionally uplifting-- always makes me feel good. Just great music,period."
4,Good for any Biker,"Bought this as a gift for one of our riding group and they all wanted to know where I got it. Simple, easy but useful item. Nice roll up case to keep all the pieces together. The guys in our group are pretty particular about their bikes - so high praise that they all want one now."
2,Brand not Specified,"I am just upset that the brand is not specified, I like to buy all my Deer Rears from brands with reputation."
4,Strong smell but it works!,I bought Bite Blocker because I wanted something that I could feel safe putting on my children. Although the smell is very stong it really works.
3,Underwhelming,"I just finished watching this on DVD. I generally like these types of films, but I didn't really connect with any of the people featured. Some scenes were pretty mundane - just day-to-day, nothing-special kinds of things. This DVD doesn't compare toBaraka, especially when Life in a Day movie is viewable for free online or available from your local library (I rented this DVD from a library)."
5,Awesome CD Set,"This CD Collection of Trance Classics Collection Series is Just Awesome Better Than The 1st CD Set.Anyone who is a Fan of Trance, should get this Collectioncome now dont be a cheap skate, buy this CDdont download it, or copy it from your friend, buy this cdyou will get your moneys worth, i know i did"
2,This is not Left Behind - The Movie,"I made the mistake of ordering this tape, thinking it was the Left Behind movie based on the popular Christina books series. I was wrong. It's an evangelistic tape is a news format to simulate what news broadcasts might be like after the Rapture. It's ok, but the production quality leaves a little bit to be desired."
2,The artwork is sadly not up-to-par with Wendy's talent.,"Catching up with my old friends was delightful, however, the artwork in this book was sadly lacking. Facial features were so unlike the original Pini characters at times that the only way they were recognizable was by their leathers. However, being completely wrapped up in the saga, I did enjoy reading about the trials and challenges new Chieftess Ember faced as she was forced to grow up quickly and lead the divided Wolfriders to a new, human-free holt. I would encourage new readers to read the early books first not only to understand WHAT is going on, but also to enjoy Elfquest from the author's own brush, as it was intended to be."
2,Pass on it,"I purchased the RZ1715 about six months ago, and it has already worn out---battery will not take a charge, before that it became unpredictable in its behavior, with a lot of soft reboots. In contrast, my previous PDA---a Toshiba that was awesome---lasted about a year. My first PDA---an inexpensive Palm, purchased simply to see if I would use a PDA---lasted two years. The RZ1715 is so radically limited on memory that ""Out of Memory"" errors were a daily occurrence; I had 64MB expansion card in it, but it only recognized the card about half of the time. This PDA is simply not built to last.Thankfully, I purchased a replacement plan when I bought it---now I'm only hoping that they replace it with something better. Wait for the sale and spend the extra $75.00 on something with enough memory to do what you want it to do."
3,I feel ripped off.,"I purchased this PDA as an impulse buy from a large store without doing more homework. I should've bought a Dell. For the same price, the Dell has more memory, more processor, and has WiFi.Now, this PDA works fine, but I'm already running out of memory. They advertise this as the multimedia PDA. How many MP3's do you expect to store on 4.23MB free memory allocated to storage? How many MPEG4s? Not much. With the low price of memory, I don't understand why all PDAs don't ship with 256MB of memory standard. This goes for all manufacturers. Get Real.The only other practical problem that I've had with this unit is the inking ability when jotting down notes. The ink doesn't flow as smooth as it should. Plus, it can't recognize even the most carefully written words. I'm not talking about ""transcriber""; it works fine. I'm talking about the ""pen"" function in ""note""."
1,its a commercial not a book,Any book has some information that is valuable. This one does but mostly pushes products and ideas by gert strand in sweeden. I have about a dozen books on brewing and making moonshine. This is the only one that i am sorru i wasted my money on.
1,"OK at the time you bought it, really bad after you used for a while","At the right beginning of my purchasing this laptop, it works ok. However, the body of the computer is so hot that is completely unacceptible. After used for couple of months, problems came out gradually: the battery completely died out, the body became very hot after you used for just half hour. The CDROM did not work any more. To my impression, Averatec product=cheap=bad quality."
2,Such a Pity.,"I truly wanted to enjoy this book. The subject matter was fine and the stories sounded intriguing. Yet, within fifteen minutes of having purchased this book I had to ask Amazon for a refund.The editing is terrible. Spell checker, anyone? There are capital U's where there should be double L's...and that's just the tip of the iceberg.I wanted to enjoy this book, but with the poor editing, it's not even worth the $1 I paid. People - just because you don't plan to charge much for an eBook doesn't mean that you can get away with not editing or proofing something before publishing it! Within the body of Christ, we're to hold each other to a HIGHER STANDARD, not a lower one!!!I would like to see this book edited, then re-released. That would make me very happy, indeed! :)"
5,Another MUST HAVE,"It seesm to me that in the land of Ye Oldie Englandie they still allow public executions. This material is not for the beginner in karate, thankfully this level of competition aint around anymore. It's the nearest thing I've even seen to what all Shotokan students would like to aspire to: one hit stopping power. A MUST HAVE - well done Tsunami."
4,Nice,"IIf you love Cole Porter music, you will love this CD. It has most of his truly big hits. I love it."
2,Disappointed,"Cole Porter's songs were written in the 1920's, '30's and '40s. However, all the cuts on this recording were produced in the 1950s (except one from 2003). I found them over-produced, with flashy orchestration, sung as if the singers wanted to draw attention to themselves, almost competing with Porter (Fitzgerald somewhat less than the others). If you like the '50s style, you'll like this CD. If you want the flavor of the '30s and '40s, you'll be disappointed."
5,forget the rest and get the best!,This is the best wax that I have ever use and I have spent a pile of money on other products that claim that they do the same. Buy it in the 32 oz size at Amazon for the best deal.nuff said!
2,"I would never recommend this thing, and I work for HP!!","It's been 3hrs now, and the thing is still ""warming up"" to make a copy. Buy a Canon Pixma MP780 and get your money's worth!"
1,Doesn't work with Windows ME,"I tried to set up the printer as explained on the poster. It wouldn't work. After I went through the manual and online help, I called tech support in Montana long distance(they do not have a tollfree number). I spent days talking to tech support, reinstalling software, trying new USB ports and cables, upgrading my chipset, and on and on. Finally I sent the printer back. I bought a Canon F50 instead. It worked beautifully right out of the box. And if I ever do have a problem, I can call tollfree. Get a Canon."
1,graphics and printquality is simply too bad,"The moment you open the book one has the feeling they are looking upon an old bunch of xerox copies. Sorry, but this is NOT what can be expected from a professionally printed book. This is really bad, difficult to read, and the graphics (I rather call them sketches) are very poor.The content may be ok, but it's just too hard to read and too hard to see what's on the pictures.There is better out there, NOT recommended."
4,A good rounded informative book,"I give Tim Boye, the author credit for explaining the entire process in easy to understanding format. I recommend this book as a stand by for all beginning knife makers. There is other books that go into much details on advance knife making, however all that information is worthless until you grasp the basics. I bought his book twice, the first one was way back in the 1980's then again the other day, It has been recommended to me, but I already have it, on an internet knife making chat-room."
4,Should get you on the right track,for the money this is a decent book and should get you on the right track with regards to making knives
1,not happy,The wrist bands along with headbands never arrived and it took a long time to get through to supplier. Ordering for Halloween costume will not order again.
4,Useful Headband,"I needed to replace my sweat bands and had difficulty finding some I liked that were resonably priced. I found these and bought several in different color combinations. They work beautifully and look great. Their only drawback is they are tight. Of course, after I wear/wash them a few times, they may loosen up.I recommend them to anyone."
5,Enjoyable for Adults and Informative for Students.,"I know that the World Book offering has fewer articles in it than Britanica or Encarta, but I grew up with World Book encyclopedias, and I became accustomed to their straightforward editorial style. When doing research as a student in elementary school, I'd always turn to World Book instead of Britanica. Then, I didn't know why, but it just seemed easier to grasp and simpler to cross-reference.This CD offering reminds me very much of my old set of encyclopedias (which I still have after 38 years). The articles are written with the same straightforward approach and the set makes a wonderful home reference. The menu system for subject selection is really well laid-out and easy for anyone to understand.This is the one that gets my vote (especially considering the wonderful pricing that World Book offers on this set)!5 stars!"
2,Great toy but stopped working after a few days,"This toy looks and feels great. It is heavy and feels like good quality. Unfortunately, it only worked a few times. My sons loved it, they got very excited to see tigger bounce. Now that tigger stopped bouncing the kids don't play with him anymore. We can still hear his voice but there is now movement...very disappointing considering we only used him about 5 times on Christmas day and never again."
5,Turbo Tail Tigger is a Hoppity Hit at our house,"We bought this for our 21 month old twins for Christmas and they LOVE it. It makes them laugh as much as Elmo TMX, but this is easier for them to hug and carry around then Elmo. It is a great toy and I will definitley be buying it as a gift in the future!"
1,Not Low Enough,"This must have been made by a bunch of high school kids, because there is absolutely no talent at all. One star does this a great injustice. Try to come back in ten years when you find some talent{hit the yard sales}. Being in California, I have seen people in Clarkville who have a better chance in the kindergarten talent show going on to stardom. Better find a real job now."
1,don't buy,"I have used this product in the past with good results, but not anymore. The product isn't as good as it was and I can guess they changed the manufacturing to China."
4,Duchess of Idaho,"Fun movie with great music, nostalgic train travel, and beautiful Sun Valley scenery. The story of a boss not recognizing the allure of his secretary or the ineptness of his cooking combines with Van Johnson's eager pursuit of Esther Williams in a ski resort. Then mix in some confused identities, fun characters and it will be a pleasant evening."
2,Soo disappointed,"I was so disappointed with this book. I got it thinking I would like to start the series, but I found that there were too many characters with the same/similar name and I couldn't keep up with the plot line. I couldn't figure out which characters to follow and which were just background images. For a book written in the 21st century, I found the lapse into idioms and speech patterns of the Black characters outdated and not true. I only finished it because I don't like to leave books unfinished that I've started to read. Took me a month to complete and I really tried to stay interested but couldn't."
3,Soccer,"Good book not great but good. Enjoyed learning about the Dutch and their development of total football. The author did a good job of obtaining information about the early players and coaches. I cant really recall the author discussing Catholics, Muslims or Protestants but for some reason he kept trying to tie Judaism into Dutch culture and soccer. Not here or there but ALOT. ?? I dont see what this religion had to do with the developent of Totalfootball to the extent of which he wrote about it? I thought I was buying a book on the development of soccer but maybe I was buying some agenda he was pushing as well. I dont know. If you can borrow it from a friend, its worth looking at. Ciao"
2,Too firm and doesn't come with the removable cover as advertised,"According to the earlier reviews, Amazon still hasn't changed its advertising on this item. The pillow IS covered by a stiff poly/cotton cover but this cover is not removable. The pillow was too firm for my husband's comfort but this is a preference and subjective. This pillow is also longer than most standard cervical pillows so the standard zippered covers we owned would not fit it. The item was returned to amazon at their cost due to the incorrect advertising."
1,picture is not reliable,"to small and unconfortable, different from the picture, i am really not satisfied next time i will not buy again"
2,Cervical Pillow,Ad is misleading. Pillow does NOT come with a REMOVABLE white polyester cotton cover. I had to purchase cover elsewhere and it costs $6 - $12 plus shipping. Who would want a pillow where you can't remove the pillow cover and wash it? Better to not buy this product. Pay a little more and get one with a cover.
5,Water Text,"Its a textbook, but interesting reading and moves quickly. Extremely valuable for the course at hand. The book arrived in very good condition and on time. Thanks."
3,all right,sinceramente el cd no es malo pero tampoco te digo que es lo mejor la primera vez que es lo escuche yo esperaba como dos o tres canciones que yo dijera wao it's hot but ninguna me llamo la atencion como (dame caliente o gasolina de daddy yankee)se puede escuchar
4,Da Bomb!,This Cd Is One Of the Hotest This Year In My Country PUERTO RICOIts Off Da Hook Every Single Track is HotTo me The Best is Sacando Chispa ft Trebol Clan y TainaIts Almost as Good as Haciendo Escante!SO betta Compt It!
3,Good songs,Lots of songs but they seem to be all in the same key (this creates a problem when every song is in a key that is too low to sing confortably). They should have recorded in the key the songs were originally written in.
1,Wrong Songs,I liked the idea that the words were on the screen and we could follow along but one of the songs was showing words for Jingle bells but playing different back ground music. I was disappointed in the quality of the music. Wished I had not bought it. Would not buy again from this manufacturer.
1,War fiction at its worst,"A blatant example of self-serving prose meant to whitewash the heinous crime that was committed at Son Thang. Based on a faulty premise, that the investigation was sparked by a report from a green lieutenant, Herrod's book reads like the whine of a child caught in mischief. The mischief this time, though, was the murder of non-combatants, all women and children. Herrod managed to get off with an all-star defense team. Maybe he should hit the lecture circuit with OJ"
4,I did like this!,"There are not a lot of ""family"" films like this out there...there could have been more character development but I will watch this one again. Great cast and characters...enjoy"
3,Great! until.....,"Okay so I don't have this, but I do own the first 3 seasons. And thats all I'm willing to get. The first 3 seasons will really make you just crazy about the show. But when the 4th season started the show began to go down hill. I suggest to only get the first 3 seasons and pretend the rest never happened and pretend everyone lived happily ever after. Because the ending of the series was a joke and could have ended it better. But if you feel the need to collect them all go ahead, but I just watch the bad seasons on netflix and see if they are worth it."
3,Little Disappointed,"I bought the complete series of mip/tuck for my mom's birthday because we both loved the show. But i found out as we were watching dics were not of great quality. One of the disc was scratch so big the ending of an episode was gone. Also on season two. Disc two and three are mixed up. The episodes which should be on disc 2 are on disc 3 , and the episods which should be on disc 3 are on disc 2. I love the series and i dont know if its amazon's fault, the seller, or the manufacturer who caused the scratch. The problem is a bought this as a gift for someone and could not open the sealed supposedly brand new seasons and check each individual disc for problems."
4,Resident Evil Bluray,i buy this trilogy very cheap only 15$. i have accept this package very good. but the amary case is very different. 2 movies with lock case and 1 didn't have it. it's look 3 movie collect from individual sale then collecting and new repack. but i have glad have this movie very sharp then my old dvd
4,Horrorbuff,"I really like the trilogy and will look for the next one. Have to see what happens to Alice, her friends and umbrella corp."
3,Drive OK but......,"The drive installed fine without any problems using XP Pro. Came with Nero 6 software (current version is 8)which is a pain to use. I updated the software to the newest release of Version 6, but it didn't help and took a long time over a dial-up line. Nero is not the way to go, other than putting it in the trash. Also, did not come with any instructions other than what is on the Nero disk, so if you have problems you have to go to the Samsung website."
4,Great Product! Good buy,This product is easy to set up with ur pc. Burns dvds really fast and silenty. Pretty much does what it says!!! Love the product
1,Terrible,"This never worked... I'm not sure if it is me, a software issue, or the burner, but it never worked."
2,Doesn't fit under my Keurig - Not leak-proof,"I bought this mug a couple months ago and it's been working pretty well as far as keeping my coffee hot.Definitely not leak-proof, even when tightened all the way. Don't even think about clipping it to a bag with that cute little carbiner clip - if the mug is full - your coffee will be everywhere but in the mug.Just got a Keurig for Christmas (yay!) but the mug doesn't fit under the brewer, even when the drip tray is removed (Boo!).Originally I was going to purchase a contigo travel mug, I had one in past and it was very leak-proof but when I bought this Thermos one because I liked that it had handle. I'm going to be looking for a new mug now - hopefully I can find one to fit under the Keurig!ProsKeeps coffee hotConsNot leak-proof (must be kept upright when full)Doesn't fit under Keurig (mug is just about 8"" in height) - if the lip of the mug was a 1/4"" shorter it would be ok, but no such luck."
5,Great mug but has REALLLLY cheap gaskets.,"I had this mug for 34 days and used the hell out of it. On the 34th day, the lower gasket on the lid fell off. I tried to get Amazon and Thermos to take care of the issue but now I'm stuck with a leakproof mug that leaks. So much for that 5 year warranty. Way to go Thermos and Amazon for dropping the ball on that one. I would have given 5 stars easily but the lack of service and general care about my defective product leaves one star.**Edit**Since I travel for months at a time, Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement for my defective mug. Thank you Amazon. This mug is five stars as well as Amazon."
3,"Good, as long as you're very diligent in its cleaning","This product does a great job of insulating.The problem is with the lid. If you drink coffee with cream, expect to have to use bleach about once a week to keep it relatively clean. It gets funk-ified really quickly with all of its nooks and crannies.It does what it's advertised to do, but it requires a whole lot of care if you expect to use it for more than a few months."
5,I can only think of 1 fault,"Why don't they make tumbler style mugs or larger sizes with the same lid?Other than that, this thing preforms as advertised, keeps my joe nice and steamy for upwards of 6 hours if it stays full and closed. Very easy to clean (dishwasher safe), fill, and drink from. It really is leak PROOF when the lid is closed and even when it is open, it is just as spill resistant as most tumblers I have."
1,Leak-Proof Only with Functional O-Ring,"I got the Thermos E5 Mug (E10500) for Christmas a few days ago. It kept my coffee piping hot for the last two days at work for about 6 hours, and I was as pleased as I can be to be a new owner. However, this morning, imagine my surprise when the ""leak-proof"" mug spilled coffee all over my suit on the Metro train ride to D.C. I realized that the bottom plastic O-Ring (smaller of the two) had fallen off the lid after hand-washing the mug last night. Even though the lid was screwed on tight, the perforations in the lid allowed liquid to spill through.I have been a devoted Thermos user since fourth grade elementary school when I had a Winnie the Pooh lunch box with a matching Thermos bottle. I am sad that after eons of experience that Thermos can't come up with a more ""Fool-Proof"" design. I've written to their Customer Service, and I'll report back on that aspect as well. Be very very careful with the O-Ring if you still decide to buy this product."
4,"Well, that's what money does to you","There is no doubt that this is a catchy, well produced, thoughtful album - but too catch, too well produced and way too thoughtful (mostly thinking about breaking into a US market I fear.) It's OK - it isn't risky, it doesn't break new ground - it should be by OLD ORDER. Having followed them since they wore long socks and shorts, I fear that we all become this predictably bland when we get near to 40. A very nice album - pity it isn't rougher around the edges."
2,Corny...,"I hadnt' read a Johanna Lindsey novel in many years and now I remember why. I picked this one up at a local library and promptly returned it a day later.Among other complaints is the fact that I really could not like this leading man. He was too selfish. Prime example...he snuck into the heroine's bed and divested her of her virginity while she was still asleep and half drunk because he ""thought"" that she was giving him come hither signals. He just said the equivalent of ""oops"". This was at a time when a woman's virginity was the key to the rest of her life....come onGraduate up a few levels and read Tempted by Virginia Henley for a truly remarkable historical romance set in Scotland. You will love Black Ram Douglass and get a taste of historical romance fiction for the more mature palate."
3,bland,"I read Man of my dreams before I read this book. Even though there were usual combination of villain, misunderstanding and all, the total story line was bland and not exciting at all. What is about Lachlan bedding Kimberly when she was sleeping so she didn't even know what was happening to her (and it happened only a couple of days after two meeting for the first time)? I would have given 3.5 stars if there is one. I would recommend Man of my dreams rather than its sequel."
5,Awesome book,River is home great read and angel city was cool because I grew up in south Fl. and I saw labor camps everywhere down.
1,This book reminds me of a certain Korean-American!,"The most appalling aspect of this book is that it makes a joke out of prostitution and glorifies pimps. I get the impression the book was written by Christian Kim under an assumed name. The content is remarkably similar to many of Christian's poetry books. It is clear, from this book, that the author views women simply as a exspendable tool for mans' pleasure. Do not support prostitution by buying this lewd, prurient and vulgar book."
1,disappointing recipes in this book!,"I was looking forward to some fun, new recipes from this book. The author owns a ""make and take"" store, and this is her cookbook. Not only did I find the recipes odd sometimes, but really not very ""family friendly"". I am really quite disappointed."
5,Thom Demijohn was Thomas M. Disch...,"It's not well-known that the co-author of Black Alice was Thomas M. Disch, the great science fiction author. (His collaborator on the book was John Sladek, another SF great.) Disch died on July 4, 2008, an apparent suicide. May he rest in peace."
3,Great passion but slightly forced sexual tension,"I do love Ms. Burton's writing and all the wonderful heat she generates between her main characters, but this one seemed a bit forced with the whole need for Max to ""find his mate."" Although I've liked the ""weather magic"" in the Storm family stories, I'm not a huge fan of the werewolf theme. And yes, while the ""passionate"" scenes are truly great, there aren't many in the book overall."
2,Neverending Story 3,Not as good as the original. A wrinkle in time has been seen by my grandchildren and they seemed to have liked it.
4,Stays with you all night,"You don't lose this one in the covers at night when you roll over. The foam could be a little firmer & for someone with a small leg the velcro strap isn't sized too well. All in all, though, I like it."
2,Knee Pads,This product did not help me at all. It was clumsy when I tried to turn over at night. I don't use it at all!
4,Leg Spacer,"This leg spacer is a bit small, but works in a pinch. I like the fact that it has a strap to go around your leg so you don't lose it while you are sleeping."
1,Gave it a fair shot,Not worth it!! Waste of money!! Won't stay in place through the night. Threw mine away after trying to use it for three nights.
5,Great for Mohawks!!!,"I have a 10in Mohawk, this spray is the best spray for keeping up my mohawk, it kept up my hair for 4 days in a row once. And thats with going to concerts and sweating to death! Use this with a blow dryer and watch the magic happen!"
3,"Hair helper, but not a hair holder . . .","Not a hair holder like I wanted. It's definitely a hair helper but don't count on it for spiking. I'm looking for a spray like Joico ""ICE"" spray that they've apparently discontinued. At least I can find it nowhere. I want a hair product that will cast my hair in concrete while still being water soluble. Help from anyone who knows will be much appreciated and USED. Tx!"
4,Funny Cartoons,"This book features humourous comic strips about rock and roll music. Fans of pop culture should dig it. Some of the jokes may be too British for Americans, though."
2,Different from the Vinyl,"This CD has 16 tracks rather than the 11 of the original vinyl record. 3 of the original tracks do not appear, being ""Love You Till I Die"", ""Feel Me"", and ""Don't Play Me A Symphonie"". Unfortunately, the first and last of these were the best two tracks of the album (my opinion). Without these, it loses that something that made the album worth chasing."
1,I'd rate it a zero if it'd let me,My daughter and I are HUUUUGE Grease fans and we were so excited when we came across this! It arrived and did not work. I thought maybe something was wrong with our karaoke machine (even though we have oodles of other karaoke cds that work fine) so I tried it in a friend's. No dice. So I requested a replacement and guess what...IT DIDN'T WORK EITHER!!!!! Don't waste your money.
5,"Mysticism in Poetry? You bet!, says Superchefblog","Can you imagine a cookbook whose every chapter starts with a poem by the greatest Sufi mystic poet Rumi -- and is actually about Food? Read more on Superchefblog at <a href=""http://superchefbloggered.blogspot.com/2006/02/sufi-cuisine-nevin-halici.html"" target=""_blank"">http://superchefbloggered.blogspot.com/2006/02/sufi-cuisine-nevin-halici.html</a>."
4,old spidies,I really enjoyed adding this figure to my collection.Thank goodness someone still carries this stuff.
2,Disappointed,"Superb Musicianship, tight arrangements, so what's wrong?If you're new to the work of the great Freddie King, considerinvesting a few bucks in the real deal. Most of FreddieKing's best work is still in print, e.g., ""Getting Ready"" or ""TexasCannonball"". His soaring vocals and wicked guitar phrasing arelike comparing a fine whiskey to this...I don't know...lemonade?I found the tracks with Mayall singing (most of them), immediatelyannoying. His straining, thin and unconvincing vocals pretty muchderail most of the material, which is too bad considering this isa lineup of musicians with talent to burn. The ""jump the shark""moment - Mayall doing the line about not being able to ""get a chitlin'pizza at any price I pay..."". I've never been a big Mayall fan as hiselephant sized ego always seems to intrude into his material and oftenpush it into the realm of precious and pretentious.This is a John Mayall CD that happens to cover Freddie King material.If you're a Mayall fan you'll probably like it."
1,Pitiful,"Don't misunderstand me... I own 46 John Mayall CD's and albums and I like his music very much. Many of his recordings are stepping stones in the evolution of the blues/rock/jazz fusion.Unfortunately, this album is not the case. After listening (just once - can't take anymore) I honestly think that this is nothing but a pitiful effort of an aging artist to make more money towards the sunset of his career...Too bad JM did not choose to issue some re-mastered/re-mixed, etc., compilations of his fantastic old material...I traded ""In The Palace of the King"" for Gloria Estefan's 1990 ""Exitos"" CD (a $1.50 value)...!!!"
3,sports wrap,"My son bought this. He is taking it back because it heats up so slowly. The wrap feature is nice. It also doesn't get very hot, so maybe the one we have is defective."
1,lack luster,"Its a nice mask, it doesn't show that its supported by a head band in the picture. Also mine came damaged and I had to pick off most of the feathers because they were broken. Will keep because of a lack of time before my mardi gras party but very disappointed."
4,Generally a good product,"I would have given it a 5 star, but the lid is kind of loose. Otherwise, the quality and size of the glass are great."
5,Just as described,This product arrived just as described and they were the perfect size for the candy buffet we are doing at our wedding. After receiving them and being so pleased I ordered 3 more!
2,Not what I was expecting,"I have entered ""glassine bags"" as keywords when I searched on Amazon. This pack of plastic clear bags should not come up as a result.The picture looks like they are white, waxy glassine bags. The product title says ""Clear"", so I should have caught that before I placed the order, but still I think this product shouldn't be included in a search for ""glassine bags.""The shipping and processing were fast and accurate; the product itself seems like a good set of treat bags. Just not what I needed."
4,Fast Service,The textbook came quickly even before it was deducted from my checking account. Having this textbook at home will help my son's back so he doesn't have to lug his school-issued textbook back and forth. It has come in handy several times already. The condition of the textbook I received was in better shape than his school-issued book.
3,"Fun, as long as you don't go to the Studio Town","I purchased this game about two weeks ago. I was having a lot of fun with it until the game started throwing me to the desktop ( just as another person mentioned in their review). I continue to play, but I do not go to studio town anymore, which does eliminate a lot of the fun. I would like to be able to play in the Studio Town, so if anyone has a solution to this problem, please email me asap at : Liz@Hallmanstudio.com"
3,Fun for a while,"When I got this game I played it for a while but now I'm too sick of it. I think this is another one of Aspyrs attempts to make money off of yet another Expansion Pack.This game is similar to Vacation. Its like; ""Cool, Superstars, now what?""So... You may choose whether or not you want to be influenced by me. If you want it, buy it! But now you've been warned."
2,Cute But Low Quality,"The gloves looked great online but in actually, the quality of the product was not what I imagined. The gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm. Instead, it had a thin sheet of nylon. The closure was not secure enough so I was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on. On the bright side, the gloves were pretty and I had no problems returning the product back to Amazon.com."
1,Don't buy anything with WinTV,"The box says that I need a CD drive for software installation. I have lots of them but they are on a network, not in the machine I want to install this on. Even though I have Hauppauge's hardware plugged into my machine, the system will not validate and allow the software to install. What a crock! Why should anyone sell a product that won't allow the software to install even when the proprietary hardware is plugged into the machine? Hauppauge tech support says that is how it is. Too bad.I am returning this piece of junk."
4,It works,"The installation went well. It actually works with Vista's Window Media Center too. The picture quality is not so great with my cable connection, but the digital over the air reception is excellent. I don't fault this device for the poor picture quality for cable channels, it's probably the cable. I like this product."
1,WinTV-HVR950,"I purchased WINTV-HVR 950 to use on my laptop that has Vista,2G RAM and a video card. The installation was easy. The picture quality was fine. However, this overtaxes my system and causes it to freeze up about half of the time. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
3,It's OK,"The tuner does an OK job. It gets some stations perfectly well, but not others. For example, I can't get NBC. I live in Nashville, so I'm sure that it is being transmitted. The channels that it does get look great, especially the HD ones.I bought this so that I wouldn't need to buy a TV. Now that I have tried it I would have gotten a small TV set. But if you are looking for something to use with your computer, this is a good option."
4,good USB HD TV Tuner,"I purchased this based upon other reviews and the Hauppauge reputation, as well as for the low price ($30 MIR from Hauppauge at the time). It works very well. The only thing that didn't work as well was the included Tuner software, but I downloaded the latest version (WinTV), which works much better and is easier to understand and looks cleaner. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone that wants to add and HD TV tuner to their PC without installing a PCI card."
4,Created problems with Windows Media Player,"I bought two of these for our laptops. After installing the WinTV-HVR-950, the driver, and the Hauppauge application software, we now have problems playing any mpg's (other than those created by the Hauppauge TV software) using Windows Media Player. Now, only the mpg's created by the Hauppauge TV software will play correctly...everything else sounds like Mickey Mouse on steroids at high speed, and the video jumps & stalls. Oddly enough, all the mpg's will play using another mpg player such as VLC Media Player or even CyberLink PowerDVD, but nothing now plays correctly using Windows Media Player except as noted above. We actually like the Hauppauge device & TV software, but cannot understand what it did to Windows Media Player after we installed the WinTV-HVR-950. If anybody knows a fix for this, we would appreciate it."
5,Working fine with vista,Downloaded the most up-to-date software from their web page. It worked just as it's was advertised to do. The only draw back is the very small antenna doesn't pick up much unless you're right in the city. On a second note the software identifies it as a 980 not the 950 are we getting a more up to date unit?
1,Causes my laptop to freeze,"I've installed this thing, it worked. Shut the WinTV2000 and brought it up again, it freezed my laptop. I have a laptop with Intel Dual Core in it and no other application running."
2,ouch,I like the idea but have had several problems getting the live tv tuner to work. I would recomend an internal card if possible.
5,tv tuner,"Excellent picture, good features. The included Titan program software is the best TV guide I have seen."
2,WinTV HVR-950 died in two weeks.,My Win TV HVR950 was working great for about two weeks and during that time i found the unit to be running very warm to hot and was thinking that was not good but then i plugged the tuner in and only the analog channels came in and them finally all channels failed. I tried a re-install of software but that didnt help. My advice is that if your tuner runs hot also then it may have a short life.
4,Good Spiritual Meditations,This is a very nice prayer book with good spiritual meditations. The morning and evening prayers are a bit less traditional than those in Blessed Be God or Lasance's My Prayer Book. I personally prefer those books over this prayer book.
4,ALWAYS A FAVORITE,"What first catches your eye is the bottle - it's a stunner. Wide and then tapered it is topped by an imaginative ruby tone shape - a pout, a kiss, a heart? All of these signify romance, which is most definitely appropriate for this subtly sensuous fragrance.Princess Marcella Borghese launched this scent in 1993 and like all classics it has withstood the test of time. Its floral fragrance is as fresh today as it was when introduced. A very feminine scent it has additional notes of fruit - plum, peach, plus musk and cedarwood.I never tire of Il Bacio - summer, winter, springtime or fall."
3,Pocket Stitches Falling Apart,If you love your My First LeapPad then you will probably like this item. It holds 3 books and cartridges. It is padded and seems like it protects the LeapPad well. Unfortunately the stitches on the cartridge pockets fell apart within a day or two of getting this with no major wear and tear. It is still usable but it does bother me that it didn't even make it from Christmas to News Years without 'falling apart.' Maybe mine was just defective.
1,Give this to someone you hate...,"I am not sure if they have changed the formulation since I used this many years ago, but they have kept the same name so I doubt it.This mass gainer will make you gag and has a strong aftertaste. You may force it down the first couple times you take it, but soon it will come back up, and violently!If you manage to keep it down, it will give you an upset stomach and diarrhea.This is if you take it in the recommended quantities (the amount needed to actual gain mass).Do your gut a favor and buy better quality mass gainer."
1,fujitsu f-5120c,very disappointed. there is no manual on this piece of equipment. you can't set up folders to save info in. would not buy this product from anybody but the manufacture from now on . right now it is worthless.
2,fails prematurely,"I've bought two of these.I bought the second one because the first developed a bad pixel, resulting in scans with a vertical black line on them. No, it was not dirt on the glass, I cleaned it carefully.The second one developed a bad pixel in the same place.(It's either a bad pixel, or dirt getting inside the glass in an inaccessible location.)"
5,I just got on exelente time and prize.,"I got the 72 Names of God: Meditation Deck by Yehudah Berg, exelente contition of use and on the good time."
4,MTV for Toddlers,Great video for Toddlers who like music and like to dance. Music by original artists that parents know and enjoy. The video is well done with lots of fun using kids and grown-ups. Our 3 year old daughter loves dancing and music. The visual format (watching other kids) keeps her attention compared with listening to music alone.
5,good holster my ruger lcp fits perfect,Good holster. Light weight. Very comfortable. I bought this for my ruger lcp .380 it fits perfect just enough padding to keep the gun from digging in ur waist.
4,Nice Holster,Does what it is supposed to do: holds a compact pistol. The soft outer material stays comfortable even in hot weather (sweating). The only complaint I have is that I wish the holster clip was fixed a hair higher up on the holster so it would sit a little lower inside the pants.
5,I use this with a S&W .38 snub nose.,I use this with a S&W .38 snub nose. This is the second one I have bought and at under $15 I would keep buying this as my primary IWB holster. Very comfortable!
3,Didn't fit the gun they said it would.,"I ordered the holster for the 3""-4"" medium sized auto (as recommended for my Taurus PT145 Mil. Pro), but it was way too small. Luckily, it was almost perfect for my pocket .380 auto. The holster works, but it is almost between sizes for guns. It is a little too big for the .380, but usable, and entirely too small for what it was listed to handle. I like the clip style and will still use it, but beware that it might not fit the weapon they say it will. If I didn't have another smaller gun that fit it, I would have sent it back."
1,Run Away,"Just to clarify - if you are cruise ship type or a resort compound type, this book is for you! For the rest of us that can find our way around a phone booth, forget this book."
4,How to enjoy your trip and know what your'e missing...,"I very much enjoyed this book. I bought it and read it and then used it the entire trip. I'm one of those people that like to know what is available all over where I'm traveling and I found the book simple and easy to use with the main high-lights. What I'd like to have seen were more recommendations on places and markets, dance etc. but that's really not the intent of the book. Besides the local paper has all that info in it in the Thursday edition. Very much worth the cost of the book."
1,not too happy,"I was not happy with this purchase at all. It is so thin that when you touch it while it is installed, you end up pushing a hole in the cover. I would not suggest this one at all, it is not durable in the least which you would think it would be where it is suppose to be out in the elements."
2,This is not a real Gauntlet game,"I bought this game hoping that it would be something like Gauntlet Dark Legacy, my favorite PS2 game. I was very disappointed.Pros: Better graphics and more special attacks.Cons: Where to start? The game isn't even fun. It isn't related to Gauntlet except in name and some background music. A small fraction of the rooms, no real information on the characters, just redundant fighting (kind of like the original Bards Tale). The special attacks aren't even useful because you get attacked by large groups in every direction. The graphics don't even stand out but instead all blend in with each other. What was Midway thinking when they designed this game?"
1,The eighth sorrow is when you buy it,"Don't do it! Save your money, and save your time. I think the other reviewer's estimate of 4 hours is overly generous - you can beat the game in two. Otherwise, I agree completely. It's a button masher with only one button needed - hit square until everyone dies. The levels are tiny, the story is non-existent, and there isn't even replay value since you've bought all the special combos before you clear the game the first time. I would have given this game zero stars, if I could.If you think you want this game, think again. Go replay Dark Legacy, or get one of the Baldur's Gate or Champions games. You'll be glad you did."
3,Gauntlet,"I have fond memories of playing gauntlet as a kid, and thought I'd try the newest one. If you are playing alone, the game can become boring and repetative. However, whenever I play this with friends, we always have a hell of a time! If you plan to purchase this game, make sure you have someone to enjoy it with, otherwise it's one long head bashing dungeon crawl. I will also say that the artwork is pretty neat!"
4,Fun & easy,"Not a bad game. It's fun to play but if you're looking for a challenge, not a good game choice, it's very easy to beat, it only took me a couple of days."
5,For that ugly mortgage.,"Haven't read it yet, but the ""ugly mortgage"" comment gave me a giggle. Here's my dollar!"
3,very nice read,"I enjoyed this book very much, it involves a dystopian society which is a common book theme- but a very unique spin on it. Fun escapism- but the reason for the dystopian society proffers good lessons for kids. I was going to recommend it to my nephew, as I think it might appeal to boys as well as girls.What I didn't enjoy is that that books 2-5 were not as good, but you're left with a cliff hanger so feel compelled to read them. I did not recommend it to my nephew for that reason. I would not have read the other books, but I want to know how it ends so I endured them, but I wonder when I willl learn the end. Throughout the series are several grammar / editing mistakes, which is annoying and not a good example for younger readers the book is"
5,Wonderful Escape,"I do most of my reading at work at lunchtime, so each day when I would read ""The Takers"" I got lost in the story deeper from page to page. I forgot for a while I was at work, as I was with Oz experiencing his nightmareous adventure. It was very hard to put the book down and get back to work! Can't wait to read the sequel and continue the escape!"
1,Not appropriate for Guinea Pigs,Guinea pig's spines are not made to bend backwards. Research has shown that running in these balls or on exercise wheels can cause permanent damage.I did not know this until after I had purchased one. It is sitting in my closet in the original packaging as it will cost almost as much to return it as it cost to purchase. It should not be advertised for guinea pigs.
1,Would give zero stars if I could!,"This type of toy is HORRIBLE for guinea pigs. Yes, good for other kinds of small animals, like mice, even ferrets I think. But guinea pigs do not have flexible spines. I always think of them like corgi dogs, you wouldn't put a corgi in a ball and force its back to curve the wrong way because it would hurt them! This toy will hurt your guinea pig and could cause long-term damage. Buy an X-pen or create your own safe, enclosed area on the floor to let your guinea pigs run around.It is really sad that this toy is marketed for guinea pigs because they really shouldn't use balls. But then again, many other products are marketed for guinea pigs that are inappropriate or dangerous--such as yogurt drops (first ingredient is sugar!!!) and anything with seeds or nuts. Do your research before buying anything that is labeled for a specific pet or breed!"
1,Horrible,It came broken. Then its so cheaply made it broke some more. You have to line it with tape just to keep the top on
2,A beautiful but poorly organized book.,"The illustrations are wonderful and the book is extremely handsome. However, the plates are sometimes of marginal relevance to the accompanying text. There is an amazing amount of information but it is hard to find, for example, a coherent discussion of all the tulip species. A personal gripe, virus infected tulips are undoubtedly beautiful but, unlike Ms. Pavord, I do not consider them to be more interesting than all other tulips."
5,"Both Amazing, First Was A Bit Better","Both of these books have been fast-paced, action and adventure filled with a great story and a likeable cast of characters. The premise is better in this one, with the whole going to school. I really enjoyed the twists and turns. However I enjoyed the first one better because it was more focused on action and this one is more about the story. I like a blend of both, but action appeals to me because of how descriptive it is. All in all they were both excellent reads and I encourage teens all over to read these, because you won't be able to put them down. They are excellent in every way.STORY 9/10 well done with a great plot, twists and turns, and a cliffhanger endingCHARACTERS 8.7/10 Likeable but lacking a little in personalityACTION 10/10 When there is action it's amazing and descriptive"
5,Love it,I chose this rating/ cuz this book was really good. I can't think of 're all my anytime who wouldn't lime it
4,"Extra info for Pullman's ""His Dark Materials""","For the ordinary person, this little book has pretty good coverage of the scientific basis for Pullman's trilogy. I am no expert, but from the info in the college courses I have taken with the Teaching Company, I think the writers have done well to condense so many items in a little space. It helps to understand that many of the ideas in Pullmans's fantasy have a bit of reality to them."
5,Love this pillow!,I absolutely love this pillow. For the first time ever I woke up without any neck pain. It continues to hold its shape and for the first time since I can remember I am sleeping on only one pillow.
1,No way!,Not sure why this has 5 stars by other reviewers. First it is made in China. If you are a side sleeper and looking for a supportive pillow pass on this one. I ordered this pillow at 5am when I couldn't sleep because of my neck and shoulder pain. So happy when it arrived yesterday but as soon as I opened the box and saw that it was folded in half I knew I would be returning it. I did give it a try but as soon as I laid my head on it my head was almost on the mattress. Not good for side sleepers at all!!! I think I am going to try the buckwheat pillow.
2,good for a while,"This HP PSC950 ""all in one"" was a VERY cheap solution to my small home office needs, but after 3 years, I am ready for another brand. Spent way more on INKS than I did for the purchase of the machine. Scanner quality was never that good & now I am getting scanner failure messages. Faxing is okay, if you power up from a cold start. Copy function won't work half the time, cuz it's busy 'warming up'. Fed up now... seeking something new & dependable."
1,Beware,"Maybe those using this for years like it, but if you're like me and may need help, beware! I had problems on Win XP Prof from the beginning. Phoned for support - their attitude should be criminal. 45 minutes on hold for a guy who couldn't wait to get me off the phone WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO FIX MY PROBLEM. He finally devoted 10 minutes to me and hung up with the product still hung up and not working. They have seen the last of me."
4,IT WORKS WELL; AND VERY COMPATIBLE.,"Although PowerQuest designed ""PartitionMagic 7.0"" for Windows XP, it remained compatible with all the Windows starting from '95. I was glad to see the software create, resize, and merge both big and small partitions on my hard-disk without destroying a single datum.Almost every claim the manufacturer labelled on the packet/box is true; except that the BootMagic utility (which is supposed to simplify the switching from one Operating System to another) is not very efficient. Also, I was disappointed to know that PowerQuest reserved her mail-in rebate solely for registered previous users who purchase this 7.0 edition. (They should have included new buyers)."
4,Cobra CB Radio Review,"Good Radio, Good audio, Good TX and RX.Small enough to fit where ever you want.Using it with my power Mic and it really screams."
3,what do you expect,"for the price, its a good little radio... if you want more extras you are going to have to shell out more bucksthe lcd screen works fine...."
1,pos,This radio lasted me 36 hours exactly 3days of work &now its shot.. i think it was a waste of hard earned money if u need a cb for work purposes do not buy a 19 ....cobra are awesome units all except the 19's..they are prob good for weekend warriors but not suitable or reliable for work !!!!!!!
2,not what i expected,The picture showed a pillow that seemed to be wide enough to rest both legs easilyNOT! it was not as comfortable as the one they gave for my cat scan. cheap and speedy delivery though. gathering dust right now.
3,Too high and not wide enough,"As another reviewer noted, this leg rest is not wide enough for the average adult. Just another 4 inches would make a difference, and I wish the manufacturer had had the foresight to know that. I also found it to be too high. I'm a short person and my feet were dangling. It would have been more comfortable if it weren't so high and my feet had touched the bed."
1,It looks WAY bigger in the picture than what it actually is....,".... but its tiny and small. Needs to be higher and way, way longer. Your legs have to be perfectly next to each other and you can't move at all or your leg, foot or whatever will fall right off. Just too small unless you look like Olive Oyl from Popeye. Some good photography work/enhancement there. Oh well."
3,"great support, but stinky","Great for under-knee support, but there was initially a very strong factory foam smell which wore off after we aired it outside for several days."
2,Duro-Med Elevating Leg Rest,"While the dimensions are accurate, the photo on the package is misleading. The rest is barely wide enough to use. It does not appear possible to remove the cover for washing. Does it work? - Yes. Would I purchase it knowing what I now know - No!"
1,Don't Be Fooled,"This pillow is featured to look long, which will provide great support when laying in bed. In reality, the pillow is barely a foot long, and you'll do good to get one knee on it comfortably!!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
3,it was ok,"It was the correct size, but the color was diffrent then the picture, and was softer then I was expecting"
5,Wonderful Music CD for the Holidays!,I love Maggie Sansone's music and this CD is beautiful background for dinner parties or just relaxing during the holiday season.
4,Compatibility issues,"Fine printer for older operating systems, but as of Dec '08 there are no drivers for Windows Vista or Mac OSX."
1,I am not happy with this photo printer at all,"I was very excited about this printer at first until I used it.For me it works properly maybe 1 our of 3 times, the photo paper jams frequently and the quality of the printed photos is not great.When I use mine I always find myself getting very frustrated and wishing that I had bought a higher quality photo printer so I am not pulling my hair out every time I try to print out pictures from my digital camera.The price is good but I would recommend buying a better quality printer."
5,easy,"very easy to use.just plug it in insert card and print pictures. i also like the size, about as big as a clock radio. going to bring to key west with me on vacation."
2,Forget printing envelopes,"I purchased this printer in Aug. 2001. From the start it would not print envelopes.Jammed every one or printed crooked. After numerous non toll free phone calls to HP, who put me thru the wringer on the phone,trying various things to get it to print an envelope, I got a replacement printer.Guess what? It won't print envelopes either ! Same issue ! I have spent over $60.00 in long distance trying to get HP to send me another printer.I have given up & am turning it all over to my state's consumer affairs office for action. Maybe they can get HP to stand by their product !Prints pictures great....just NOT envelopes !!"
3,Regarding spoilers in this volume,"Another reviewer notes: ""this one spoils the suspense of other volumes (Shards - Ascent - Reunion) by telling what happens to the elves who are fighting elsewhere while Ember is muddling through 'Huntress.' I'm amazed that the authors did such a clumsy thing!""It's worth noting that the reason for this is that the original comics of Huntress and Shards were being published simultaneously. References back and forth were to keep the stories current with each other -- but I agree that if you are reading them in this book format, rather than the original serials, there is risk of such spoilers.(Amazon requires that I give a rating, so I'll rank this book 3 stars, on a scale from 1 (anything Barry Blair did in the EQ world) to 5 (Pini art & stories). To one who spent decades with only Wendy Pini's art, the very different art style here is jarring, and the story sometimes clumsy -- but worthwhile once I got past that.)"
1,More nonsense from the crowd pushing phony Lyme treatments,"We bought this book shortly after someone in our family was diagnosed with Lyme. No question that Lyme is a serious infection if left untreated. However, readers and others interested in the subject need to know that there is plenty of good science and straightforward treatment for the disease; books like this one simply lead people to non-science hysteria and exorbitantly expensive (but unnecessary) long term treatments. Ignore books like this, check out reputable sources like the Centers for Disease Control, follow the standard short term antibiotic treatments and the disease can be effectively dealt with. That was our experience and it's worked for thousands of others hit with this bacterial infection."
4,When friends are not really friends,"Mondays were open mike nights at Cafe Heaven. The writing is good and the recipes are too. Heaven Lee is a former lawyer. She runs a cafe in Kansas City. Heaven visits New Orleans for the purpose of planning a benefit banquet in honor of the oldest convent in America. She learns that someone has sent anonymous notes that the waiters in her cafe are diseased. She collects the notes from the Kansas City Star and city hall on the advice of a hate crimes expert. Later Heaven feels better when she learns all of the chefs involved in the banquet received such notes. A friend's husband, Truely, is found stabbed at the benefit event with a stolen cross placed on his body. Heaven assigns herself the task of sorting it all out to find Truely's murderer. The scenes are lively and the plotting is clever."
1,this seller needs better color representation on web page,I should not have ordered based upon other reviews due to not really being able to see the color. It is nice makeup but will not cover tattoos as advertised and smears pretty easily. Good for some things but not all that is represented on sale page.
2,Decent Foundation...coloring way off!,"I bought this foundation hoping to get better quality and good coverage in exchange for a higher priced cosmetic. The product does have great coverage and staying power. It leaves a matte, velvet finish and resisted wearing off during exercise and high humidity. However, the color is very orange or red based. I have quite pale skin and when I put this on (ivory color) it appears like I have a red mask of makeup. I would recommend it though if you are looking for heavy coverage and can find a color to match your skintone."
1,Very unprincess-like behavior -,"I purchased this on good reviews for a friend's birthday. I was shocked to read this. Bad behavior, characters poorly expressing themselves, social and environmental irresponsibility, and yes with elements of a dragon and a paper bag there should be some suspension of belief, but this was scientifically implausible. In short, I didn't see any useful lesson or impact it would make on a small child. I didn't give it to the 4 year old for her birthday, instead after an attempt to return, forwarded it to a psychologist friend to get his insight. I would not recommend."
3,Should have read more carefully,"The story is great, and good especially for small girls who love princesses (and their parents who are frustrated with princesses who have to be rescued). However, be sure to look carefully at the size of the book you're ordering. I didn't read carefully enough and the first copy I ordered was 3 inches by 3 inches - not good for a 2 1/2 yr old!"
3,Too PC for me but an antidote to princess stories,"It's good that there is an inverse out there to the typical princess fairy tale but the story makes me a little uncomfortable. I'd like my daughter to read it once but it's really a drag to have to keep reading it over and over. The prince is too much a caricature of the insensitive male and I find this too unfair to my sons. Unless you're happy with having a strong feminist perspective in your children's books, you may not like this one."
5,"A must have for all PRINCE'S book collections, too!","I appreciated seeing another review from a parent who reads PBP to her boy. It's an important message not only for girls, but for boys as well."
5,Great girl book,A wonderful original fairy tale with a strong and smart heroine. Princess Elizabeth is a great example for little girls. Sometimes the prince is not worth having!
3,Great Book! SMALL SIZE,"I really love this book and so does my daughter, but I was extremely disappointed in the size of the book. I guess I should have looked at the size, but that's not always something one would look at when purchasing a book online - I know better now. It would help with such items as these to place ""pocket size"" or ""travel size"" which usually means that it's small. I have read this book to my daughter and son at night with great difficulty b/c they couldn't see the pictures/book at the same time. I will be re-ordering a bigger size of this book. I guess I should have known by the price as well, but I thought I had found a super-great deal, but found out otherwise! Very disappointed, but partly my fault; should have look at size. Anyway, great read:children and adults will enjoy this book. Check the dimensions!!!!"
5,One of the best shows on TV!!,"This is one of the best TV sitcoms I've seen on TV in a LONG LONG time!! If you have never seen it before, you HAVE to check it out!!The show is set in the 70's (obviously) but they deal with topics that everyone can relate to. The unique thing about this show is how they constantly go into fantasy sequences which are always hilarious!!The whole cast is outstanding!! I love the way they interact with each other and you can tell that the actors are having a great time. I've seen this show taped live several times and they have so much fun!! All the actors take the time to meet and sign autographs for everyone at the end of the taping.I enjoy watching this show over and over. I own the first two seasons on DVD, I watch the re-runs everyday, I watch the new episodes every week and I go to see it taped live every chance I get. I still have not gotten enough of this show. I would give this show more stars if I could.DEFINITELY BUY ALL THREE SEASONS!!!"
1,Poor customer support,"I'm very disappointed in Hewlett Packard as a company. My printer arrived missing parts December 24th. I have called HP Tech 3 times and was assured they would send the part right out to me. It's now January 25th and I still haven't received anything. In my opinion there are too many other manufactures who want my business, I don't need to deal with this kind of customer support."
5,Why COSMOS is no longer available,"According to PBS, the rights to this excellent series were withdrawn by the wife of Dr Carl Sagan following his death."
5,Availability,"The non-availability of the series ""Cosmos"" is definitely a disservice to the human race,no matter who is responsible."
5,an enlightenment process that impacted me profoundly,this video changed me. i want to see it again. why the hack is it not available!
1,This is a DOS application,"Even though Drive Image allows you to set up parameters in a Windows interface it is actually a DOS program, the disk image reboots in DOS mode and runs in DOS. Unfortunately if you want to create your disk image on a USB device, such as an external USB disk, The windows drive letter isn't known by DOS. So when Drive Image reboots you in DOS it fails. In my case it actually froze; so I had to manually reboot to get back to windows.Since this is a DOS application & there are a lot of removable USB based storage options available, this DOS based application is basically obsolete. Save your money , DOS is dead."
1,Running XP Professional? Save your money!,"The description says ""Support for Windows XP"", but that's only partially true. You don't find out until you read the manual that the included DataKeeper software for data file backups is not supported for XP. If your running Windows XP Professional you can backup and restore your hard drive with the Automated Sytem Restore and Automated System Recovery that you paid for when you bought XP Professional. ...."
5,"Great coverage of NT, Windows 2000, LanMan security","This book is important for anybody wanting to correctly understand Windows NT/2000 security whether you program, build or admin Windows NT/2000 networks. Security setup must be done properly in a production system, espically one serving the Internet. Keith gives a great overview of the NT/2000 security infrastructure in a style that gives you the right perspective to see why and how it works the way it does. Is the Guest logon in the Authenticated Users group? What and Why are NULL sessions? The tricks of Net Use lmsessions. The background to understand ticket based security and cached credentials. Its all covered very well in this very readable book."
4,A good buy overall,I just purchased this printer because I am tired of paying .50 a pop for prints from my digital camera. I do a lot of scrapbooking and I see now that this printer will help me in more ways than just photos.I previously owned a Lexmark 2050. It was very easy to install once I discarded the instructions from the cd and just let Windows find the printer and drivers. The photoimpression software does not put as good a quality prints for some reason as printing directly from a smart card from my camera. However I got excellent results whan I used Photoshop.The only minus is that when you use glossy photo paper it leaves very faint drag lines (not exactly scratches but similar) down the left side of the print. THese are only really visible when you hold the print at an angle and catch the glare of light off the print.
2,"Print quality is great, but why won't it print straight?","I like everything about this printer except for the fact that the paper doesn't feed straight. As a result, photos are slightly askew on the paper, just enought to be annoying and to make printing on 4X6 photo paper a waste of money. I exchanged the printer for a new one, and again the same problem. I just picked up my FOURTH 1115 printer and am keeping my fingers crossed. If this one doesn't work, I'm going to Epson."
5,Quiet and Good Quality,I bought this printer a while back and it works great. Very quiet and great photo quality. The ink is medium priced and lasts a long time. The photo quality is excellent and can use both Compact Flash and Smart Media Disks to store photos and projects so you dont need your computer to print photos.Great Buy!!
4,Very easy to use and set up,"I read the reviews and found out a lot of peeple have problemto set it up.However, I have no problem to set it up. My PC is running window2000 and I download all software from HP web site.I am happy with it."
3,Tiny but Cute,"I purchased this as a boobie prize for a Ham Radio (amateaur radio) club event. The pig is cute, but it's a lot smaller than appears in the photo.The quality is average. I have no idea how well it would work with a child."
2,Tried to like it....,"I really tried to like this book. I read over 1/2 of it before giving up. The main character got on my nerves. Every decision is a moral dilemma, it's amazing the woman can leave her house. The character was hard to like and seemed very weird, like she should be on meds. I got tired of her and the characters that didn't seem to fit in the story (the Italian and the niece's ex-boyfriend). I've tried to read the author's lady detective agency books and now realize that his writing is not for me."
3,Something almost happens,"I have to admit that, although I enjoyed reading this book, I was disappointed when I reached the end and realized that nothing much had really happened. There was the prospect of a juicy hit and run murder, perhaps the question of questionable transplant ethics, perhaps something supernatural and outside the realm of rationality - but, no - nothing really comes of any of it. It reminds me of Virginia Woolfs 'To the Lighthouse' with much internal rumination and complex social mores and not much actual action. I would prefer if there were even a small crime or mystery, such as those solved by the Botswana detective lady in the midst of her gentle African ruminations. This was more just leaping about to wrong conclusions, and Ms. Dalhousie is much too intelligent for that."
1,Worst book ever,"How did this ever get published? The author sets out several interesting premises and then, unable to work out any reasonable outcome to ANY of them, proceeds to shoot them down like in a carny's gallery. Shame on you, Mc Call Smith! I won't try to resell this p.o.c. I'll turn it into ""book art"" ..the binding, paper, etc. is beautiful."
2,What did I miss?,"A favorable review had me looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, the self absorbed narrator's fuzzy saga of a mixed-up friendship never seemed remotely real to me. Throw in plot devices to include a poorly explained antipathy from the father of the ""best friend"" plus an unconvincing infatuation with a new girlfriend and it all spells a novel in need of an editor or a rewrite. Luckily the late chapter climb sequence on El Cap redeems some of the early awkwardness. Still, I have to believe that Duane's next work will be more coherent and better overall."
4,California culture and a life in high places,"Looking for Mo is a traditional tale set vertically on a big wall. You know, the wild friend everyone has and wants to be -- you hear reports about his latest adventures through the grapevine, receive cryptic emails from third world countries about how the morning light there is otherworldly. And when he returns you have to come to grips with his wildness, somehow incorporate it into your life and make it yours too, but you can't steal it from him. My version of Mo is in Chiapas, Mexico, somewhere. But I need him there. Duane gives an honest rendition of what it is to have a friend like Mo."
4,A great puzzle book,"I found this puzzle book to be very helpful. The positions are realistic with realistic variety (approximately an equal mix of kingside castled positions and ""exposed king hunt"" positions with few queenside positions). Unlike the Reinfeld 1001 Checkmates, each puzzle in this book tells you how many moves you need to make to reach checkmate. I found that this forces me to look more deeply at the position because a lot of times you might see what looks (for example) like a simple mate in two but it is actually a mate in three. When this happens you know you've missed the opponent's best reply. Even though not knowing the number of moves would be more realistic, this is a very valuable exercise and it has actually led to an improvement in my ability to solve the Reinfeld problems. I deducted a star for a few errors but otherwise this is a great exercise book."
3,This stuff stinks to high heaven...,"Plan ahead. I have no issues with this as a fertilizer, but don't mix it indoors. If you are using it for indoor plants, mix it with water as instructed, then add it to your soil that you plan to use later (2-4 weeks). Leave the slurry you just made in the garage until it dries out. Be aware that molds and fungus will take charge of this evil brew until the soil completely dries out. Then, turn it over (till it up) and add your other ingredients like sand, dolomite lime, bat guano, Pearllite, etc., or whatever your normal mixture is for use in potting. I have used this product for foliar watering but only severely diluted, and it still brings on a heavy growth of fungus.Peter"
5,Something Different for Christmas,"As a musician, I greatly enjoyed this CD. The use of only acoustic instruments lends atmosphere to the tunes. All tunes are centered around the hammered dulcimer. Because I have grown tired of the synthesized instrumentation on many Christmas albums, this was a welcome change."
3,Something everyone should do.,I had as a kid and I still look back at the old pics and grade cards. Every kid should have one.
4,Loads of Fun,"I originally purchased this for my 6 yo, but it has grown to be loads of fun for the whole family. I especially like that it has differeent levels of play so that my children can grow with it. The availability of different music cartriges is another example of how this ""toy"" can expand with my children. Fast delivery from Amazon. Good Show !!"
2,"Not a teaching tool, just a game...then it stopped working.",Santa brought this gift for Christmas and my 5 and 6 year old girls started to play the games right away. The games are easy but it doesn't teach piano skills or musical notes. It is simply a game that has a keyboard instead of a joystick. There is nothing about his toy that will teach a child about music or how to read music. Then it stopped working after only three days and now it is going back to the store. I'm not sure if I will get another because I have read several other reviews about this item and how it has stopped working after a couple of days.
1,Very Disappointed,"We purchased this for my 6 year old who is very music oriented. She loves her toy keyboard, and plays lots of video games (lik vsmile) so we thought this would be a good fit.We were very disappointed in the quality of the software, and my daughter was finished with it in about 15 mintues. She didn't even like the freeplay feature, because it had annoying background music.This toy is definitely not worth the price, it's very poor quality. Also, the notes hardly matched up with the song, so you didn't even feel like you were learning the melody."
1,2nd Dead Piano,"I have tried all the suggestions from other reviewers--I've held the power button down for up to a minute, and it never comes on. I've made sure the ON/OFF switch on the back is in the ON position. The cartridge is in securely. The power cord is in. I have worked in IT for over 6 years, repairing computers and I cannot get this thing to work. We purchased the first one from Walmart, it worked about a week and died. I returned it and couldn't find another one anywhere locally so I ordered from Amazon. It arrived quickly, everything was OK and now, 3 months later it has died again. Unfortunately I am past the 30 day period for returns on Amazon and I am getting nowhere with Fisher Price, so for now I have a dead piano and I'm out $60. The concept is super cool, my daughter loved it, but it definitely has some sort of power problem."
1,outdated,"I had the Guia Roji map and the new Quimera map in my hands and after reviewing both extensively I decided to buy the Quimera map. Why? Guia Roji's map is about 12 years old, printed on cheap paper, many spots don't exist any more, even street names have changed!Quimera not only shows the center area of town but also Tlaquepaque's center, the metropolitan area, the surroundings, and Jalisco state - and is brand new.What would you choose for?"
2,Bad decision !,"It was working great at the beginning, but later it stopped working for no reason. I bought it six months ago, and now I can not use it anymore. It is little bit expensive, which I thought it is a better quality. But then, It turned out that it is very bad product. Do not worth it at all. Unless, if they replaced me with a new one. But it dose not worth the time."
5,A breeze!,I love this so far. Clothes that get so wrinkled- but don't work to iron are perfect- cotton etc. Well designed with the cord keeper and steam pause. The nosle is a bit awkward to put back on. I do think that you might have to iron once in ahile some severely wrinkled pants/jackets etc but this has saved me so much time and I look way better! Clothes I never wore are seeing the light!
1,Poor riddled with syntax errors,I don't usually feel strong enough to write reviews however don't buy this book unless you want to spend hours debugging someone elses code just for the fun of it. I could have written my own in less time that it took me to fix the errors found in the code. In addition you would expect the downloadable code to work and they don't either. They are not even the same code examples found in the book. Unless you want to pay for the ideas and what modules to use this book is a waste of money.
3,"Not ""Wicked Cool""","I'm going to be grumpy about this.I have nothing good to say about this book. I don't have anything bad to say (except maybe that I dislike titles like this), but nothing grabbed me, nothing excited me.Maybe that's because the kinds of examples presented are just what Perl is best at doing - the author demonstrates that a properly stocked toolbox can indeed be used to build a birdhouse, repair a sticking door, hang a picture. Yaaaawnn..If you know nothing whatsoever about Perl, I suppose this might be fun. But why would you read it if you knew nothing? I think that's probably the basic flaw here: it's not a ""Learn Perl"" book, and it doesn't explore the more esoteric areas. The subtitle says ""Useful Perl Scripts that solve difficult problems"", but there are no difficult problems here, just building birdhouses, hanging pictures, and so on.Just not my cup of tea, I guess."
2,Secret Lives of the First Ladies,Did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. Rather dry and not too much new information.
4,Secret lives of the First Ladies,I LOVE this book. It's full of interesting information. I love books like these where you get to learn something. I have given it to two of my friends that are history teachers and they have used some of the information about the first ladies in their lessons. It's something that the kids can find interesting. I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in history.
3,When it works it's awesome when it works.,"You need to use other software found on the internet.I had to search pretty hard to find it, but it's out there.The thing locks you out randomly, and if you have to stare at the keyboard when you type you're SOL.I think it's just a weak battery, but haven't purchased a replacement battery yet.When it works, it's awesome. I personally like the fact it doesn't unlock your pc when you come back, just in case someone snags the keyfob."
1,Quite a bad book.,A lot of bla bla in this book. This book is a collection of notes without a guideline in mind. The more interesting subjects of functional analysis are only superficially treated. Proofs are often quite shortly illustrated and in a proof I found a gigantic error. Not worth to buy this book.
3,Great Book,"I was a little disappointed since this book was a basic rewrite of others this author had done. Still, it was good."
2,Too cheesy,"I'm not sure why anyone would be interested in this item. If you're looking for original, out-of-the-ordinary songs for a wedding, then it's not appropriate, because most of the recorded songs are the classics. If you're looking for great new renditions of the classics, look elsewhere -- the ones here are cheaply produced. The book contains a list of songs, but then again that information could be found on the web or provided by any DJ. There are a couple of songs on the CD you might not otherwise think of, but they're too cheesy, at least for my taste."
1,Waste of money,"Like the other reviewers, I was also very excited to get this game. As a big fan of the Dark Legacy game, I am sorely disappointed in Midway for developing such a sorry game that resembles nothing of the ""arcade"" feel of the past Gauntlets. Definitely no replay value so a complete waste of money."
4,Avid Gamer,"IF you enjoyed gauntlet legends, then you'll enjoy this game. Its an easy beat if you are a good gamer, but a lot of fun play time. Each level and boss get harder and harder, with an ultamite boss that is the end of the game. But with a four player option, and four different playable characters, along with four settings: easy, normal, hard and impossible, creates a great challenege. I haven't discovered any unlockables yet, which is always a nice plus, to unlock a character or bonus level. Overall, a good game to have to enjoy with a friend or on a down day."
3,"An honest, descriptive account from a SEAL operator","Too bad Mr. Young retired with less than 4 years experience as a SEAL team operator.The accounts do get repetitive , but I do recommend the book. Other SEAL books such as First Seal by Roy Boehm have a much more historical perspective to it, and may present a better choice for the reader's money."
1,Technical Problems on offer of Download vesion of Page-a-Day,"Buyer beware. The promise made on the packaging of a ""free"" calendar for your computer if you purchase Audubon 365 Birds Calendar if not ""true"" at this time (late February 2000). The paper version is all you get!"
2,Not the best in tent camping,"I thought this book would be helpful in our move to socal, but I was not impressed with the selection of campsites, organization, or even the campsites featured. The first campground we went to that was supposedly the highest rated in the area had, guess what...RVs, concrete slabs, and loud radios. Maybe the problem is not the book, but southern california. I would suggest real tent campers find another book."
2,a little hard to use and often not true in the summer,"Some of the sites in this book are as advertised, but because of the way that it's organized, it's cumbersome to use while planning a trip. You can't really tell where each site is along different routes until you look up close, and the order doesn't help you.My biggest gripe is that some of these sites are FAR from quiet when you get there; RV's ARE allowed at some of these sites (and he doesn't say which ones).In my opinion, you're better off with a more comprehensive guidebook that tells it like it really is for each site."
5,Wonderful Music,"I purchased this CD a few years ago and have never grown tired of it. The arrangements are wonderful and it makes the nicest background music. Buy it now, you won't be disappointed!"
2,Utah baseball history,"Produced by Utah educational TV, this is a typical PBS-style documentary about the history of the game within the state of Utah, beginning with an 1869 visit from the Cincinnati Red Stockings that got the state interested in the sport. Should be pleasing to Utahans and baseball history fanatics everywhere; otherwise pretty dull."
1,It often requires hard resets - will NEVER buy HP again,"Too often HP IPAQs appear to have a reliability problem; apparently, HP has been laying off people, which may make the situation even worse. IPAQs get only a 90 day warranty and theie people will refuse to talk to their customers after that period of time."
5,Works perfect,This was a great price for the product and I received them fast. Recommend them if you can wait for the shipment.
1,Ehhhh,"Adapter doesn't work well, efficiently. Maybe it is just my specific phone, but I can't make any file transfers either way...which is the primary reason I purchased the adapter. I'll stick to the one built into my laptop for now I guess. I have an LG Venus (if anyone on here is buying it for their own).My advice like many of the others is to fork out the extra bucks and buy a quality adapter that will work and last!"
2,No Vista Support!!!,"This might be a wonderful product but I failed to notice that Vista is not supported. Drivers do seem to be available now from a third party (and must be paid for). Absolutely no product support. In fact, the box has no mention of the manufacturer."
1,Don't do it!,"Like Derek, above, I bought this with high hopes for an all in one unit. Nothing worked properly. I called a non toll free tech support number, finally got thru and listened to the tech read an algorithm. Nothing worked. We then did a swap. Guess what? Same exact problem! No dial tone, mixed ring signals etc. Tech support told me that the phone line frequency wasn't specific enough for their precision engineered product. PLEASE GIMME A BREAK!! 15 years of phone and fax machines on that line means the problem is with the HP and not the phone line. DON'T BUY this machine if you want to preserve your sanity."
1,inherent technical problem,"Had two machines with same problem of dialing 1 before all calls including local calls. HP technical support recommended returning this product because this is a frequent problem with this design. As with many support desks, help was poor, with friendly but, technically inadequate personnel. I expect that I would receive better answers than ""Try unplugging and replugging the machine...."", or ""Maybe it's the phone company..."". or ""Maybe it's your DSL connection..."", etc.... and YOU pay for the call too."
1,Dishonesty from Amazon & Pampers,"We've always paid extra for Cruisers with mesh lining and ordered from Amazon Prime. Neither Amazon nor Pampers websites provide straightforward information about the change in product. Amazon shamefully continues to show a box and a diaper that are NOT what I received when I ordered (no mesh lining- a purple non-mesh lining now, and box is slightly different). Shame on you, Amazon! And Pampers has dropped this diaper totally from its website and now features their ""new"" poorly rated version. Incidentally, my local grocery store carries the original mesh ones at a decent price. For shame! No way to treat loyal customers."
1,2 1/2 years of using Pampers and suddenly regular leaks and now a rash - bring back OLD Cruisers!,"Simply put, my 2 1/2 year old son has been happy in the old Pampers Cruisers, and over the past month we have had a surge in leaky diapers and, more telling, a new rash on his ""John Thomas""! Never had a rash before on his front side. And as for the leaks, I'd hazard a guess that the reduced elastic lining and mesh lining play a major part.I will be switching to Huggies even though they previously didn't fit him properly.I urge you to boycott these new Dry Max diapers to send a message to P&G; that they cannot make cost-cutting decisions disguised as ""product improvements"" when there wasn't necessarily an issue with the previous incarnation of the product anyway!If they have faith in their new ""improvements"", then offer both old and new products to their customers and let them decide!"
3,Submissive In Wonderland!,"Although I own all the Wonderland Series.I have some issue with this one.I like the story,just some parts of this book didnt sit well with me.She was to submissive to her man,which it was kind of annoying me a bit or maybe I just like heroine's with at least some backbone:),instead of"" Here slap me with a collar and make me beg for it!"".But other then that this was a great book and a good author!"
1,Worst Sound Quality Ever,"Despite the inclusion of a couple of highly amusing songs, most of the selections on this collection of Bollywood tunes are ill-chosen. Most importantly, this is the worst sounding collection I've ever bought (and I have LOTS of Indian pop music). Most of the Indian soundtracks on VINYL that I own sound better than this, and Indian vinyl, up until recently, is notoriously of poor quality. I don't mind mono, am not bothered by a little surface noise from vinyl transfers, and can even stand a little bit of distortion, but the scratching and hissing here is easily as loud as the music and the distortion due to a much-too-high record level is intolerable on a majority of these tracks. So, even if you collect Indian music as a specialty, avoid this one at all costs!"
2,to light weight,This would be great to used for starter plants but not strong enought to hold small potted Plants. did not fill my need.
1,terribly overpriced,"the shelves were adequate for my purpose, but i was insulted by the price. i dont need anything given to me but expect a fair value. if there was $5 worth of materials in this i would be shocked. would have returned it but was too lazy."
3,"Useful, but ...",It is a good book for good understanding of the concept but it has a major fall back. There are some mistakes and missing points in formulas and derivations such that you feel to derive every formula again.It would be nice if codes for the simulated images and etc. in the book is also included.
3,Consecutive Concertos...,"One can't help enjoy this over 3 1/2hr. classical romantic rompof some of the world's most beloved piano concertos! Most date from the earliest days of stereo. The well done EMI remasteringblends one concerto to the next seemlessly. Even the 1986 Tchiakovsky(the latest entry in the collection)dose not overshinethe rest. Technically the artistry matches or surpasses alot of recent budget CD's usually featuring obscure Eastern European ensembles and soloists. However, only the Karajan/Richter-Haaser Brahms is reviewed in the current Penguin Budget Record Guide. As usual liscensing company DISKY provides no annotationmaking this another half-hearted effort. Add a star if you have any particular affinity toward any of the performers. A bonus work of Franck's ""Symphonic Variation"" for piano and orchestra is included. If you can get this cheap, get it!"
2,"Hard as a rock, feet fall asleep","I have to scratch my head and wonder, did I get a different wedge then the good reviews? This thing was comfy for very short periods of time then my legs would ache and my feet would fall asleep. I have good circulation, no health problems (I was recovering from elective surgery when I used this). I really worried this could cause blood clots because it was so hard. I think the shape and height was good, but the hard material it was made from made it only good for short periods of use."
4,exactly what I expected,When a person orders something like this you don't know what the quality is going to be. This item looked and felt like the more expensive ones we saw at the health aids store.
4,Finally relief!,After having several years of back pain from a car accident this has finally offered me relief. I've tried everything from inversion table to physical therapy and nothing seemed to work. This is a simple solution. It's firm and a bit hard to get use to sleeping in this position the first night but I felt such relief the following morning.
2,Bed Wedge needs additional length to provide support,"The firmness of wedge is great, however with only 20"" of leg support, your legs hangover and pull on your muscles, added the weight of bed covers, makes this not very effective, and in fact painful. Look for at least 26-30"" of leg support rather than the 20"" offered by this item."
4,good lower back release,"Wedge is sturdy/firm and comfortable, providing leg elavation that I'd previously concocted with the used of a couple of pillows, which were too soft and slid around during sleep. Didn't notice any foam aroma upon opening packaging, but aired 24 hours anyway (just let sit out on a chair). Husband needs one, just doesn't realize it yet, so may end up ordering another."
5,incredible confort,"i was having pain in my legs 'cause a was overweight and when i bought this product and started to use it i relaxed my pain every day and every night,you dont need anything else but this pillow.very nice and usefull"
4,Duro-Med Ortho Bed Wedge,"This wedge is great for relieving back and leg strain! My only complaint is that I found the cotton cover somewhat scratchy. I would love to be able to purchase additional covers (in a choice of colors) of a softer fabric, such as French terry or cotton knit."
5,bed wedge is great,This is my second wedge purchase. I bought this for my father who needed to keep his legs elevated for pain relief. I like the fact that it comes with a cover that is washable. I would reccomend getting the smaller wedge for a woman as this one is rather large. I researched medical supply companies and the web and Amazon had the best price.
3,Only 2 new episodes,"I think the super mario bros. super show is great but I was disappointed to see that 3/5 episodes were already released on mario's greatest movie moments. The 2 episodes on this dvd that have not yet been released are Star Koopa and James Blonde. If you don't have mario's greatest movie moments then I suggest you buy it, but I still think they should have made volume 2."
4,Just as I remember,"My son loves this and it is just the same as I remember it. Though it is quite corny to watch, great show for kids."
2,Disappointing,"When used as a graduate level textbook, this work places extreme demands on the student. The lack of simple examples to explain foundation concepts places the student at a disadvantage from the start. The summary examples at the end of each section seemed to be confined to the author's research work and leave the reader more puzzled than enlightened. The endless stream of acronyms is initially annoying, but then becomes almost comical as the experienced reader (ER) becomes more accustomed to the practice. The text is a good resource for anyone specifically interested in risk management of water resource projects. For the rest of us, we'll have to look elsewhere."
1,What a gyp,"I've been waiting for over ten days for my disk. There sits my computer, unable to be set up with our server. This is holding up our entire office. Never again."
4,TKO Heavy Bag Wall Mount,"So far this unit has held up well; however, I noticed that they sell a better unit for about $10 more. The other unit is more robust and would have been a better option. This unit works well but you will need to mount it on boards to provide a more secure installation. I installed mine on (2) 2""x10""x68"" boards and lag bolted the boards to the four studs that they crossed. In this way the weight is better distributed and no solely focused across just two studs."
3,We want more midget's singing!,"Kid Rock was ok, bawitdaba is a good song and cowboy is definetely original. But the thing that stole the show was the midget rapping. If that would have been on every track this cd would be 5 stars across the board guarenteed. =)"
1,Go back to the trailer!!!!,"Kid Rock proves to us that swearing and loud music can actually suck. His album, Devil Without a Cause is a complete disgrace to both hip hop and rock. After hearing Eminen, I thought the whites had something going but Kid Rock proves to us why we put away those old Twisted Sisters and Vanilla Ice records."
5,Only God Knows Why... Britney Spears gets more fame.,"This C.d. is phat. It's so totally awesome! Even my mother thinks that this c.d. is great. This c.d is a great accomplishment from Kid, and I hope he will keep his standereds set high, higher than you'll ever believe."
3,he's allright,"I used to think Kid Rock was a chump, but I took a gamble and bought his CD, and was pleased. Kid Rock knows what is going on. I was proved wrong by him, and enjoy listening to his CD. I am not a rap fan at ALL, but enjoyed what he did with this CD, and for the people out there who call this trash, well lets just say, those with short attention spans, and a poor taste in music, are in my prayers. So if you aren't close minded, do yourself a favor, and take a risk. Buy it, listen to it, and enjoy. It is a upbeat album that will put you in a good mood, it won't make you feel as though you want to slit your wrists or anything. I love all music, Sublime is among my favorite, Clapton, Zeppelin, Stones, STP, Van Halen so on and so on. Good job Kid, job well done"
4,Kid Rock's Devil Without a Cause CD rocks the house!,"Kid Rock's CD Devil Without a Cause has some bumpin' tunes! Kid Rock busts some pretty good rhymes! When the CD first gets started it has some good songs, but once it starts to get to the end it loses it's edge. You can expect that to happen when this is his first ""big"" CD. But overall this CD is good to play at parties and stuff like that! It will get a crowd moving!"
2,devil without a clue,"while this may be slightly better than some of the other rap/rock albums out there, its still not worth the time and effort not to mention the money it takes to go to the store and buy."
1,Kid Rock is not a playa,Kid Rock is a bum that has no life. Hey Kid get more pot and smoke it. This cd is a BIG WASTE! don't this get vanilla ice Hard To Shallow Kid Rock can't shallow this!
5,One of the best rock albums in a while!,"Kid Rock's ""Devil Without A Cause"" is one of the best rock album's to come out in a while. Many hardcore-rock songs. You have to buy this C.D. because Kid Rock needs the support. Plus, Joe C. rules!!!!!"
3,Mr. Romeo Rocks,"The Kid rocks it up, but then again its the first effort and there is always room for improvement."
4,Kick A$$ CD,"This cd is great for so many people. if you dont like just rap, so what. if u dont like just metal, big deal. Because this cd does the best job of combining the two styles. the guitar riffs are great and so are the rhymes. its not in your face like korn of lb but its just as good. the rap isnt as street as dmx but it rivals the b boys.! check this one out."
2,"one hit wonder, but what a hit",The only good song kid rock ever did is bawwitabaw the rest of the songs he has done suck. But bawwitabaw is such a good song that it brings one of the worst albums ever (aside from that song of course) up to two stars
1,One of the worst CD's I ever bought. 2good songs. Terrible!,This album isn't worth the 12 bucks. There's like 2 good songs. And the rest is like some...weak country poop. Don't trust Bawitaba it is the only cool fast song. The rest is just weak. That's all there is to say.
2,Don't buy this CD!,"I gave it 2 stars for the number of good songs on it. The good songs are ""Bawitdaba"" and ""I am the Bullgod."" The rest is just him rapping about how many women he's had sex with and pointless profanity. You want a real Metal CD? Buy Limp Bizkit's Three Dollar Bill Y'all or any Korn CD."
1,Naughty lyrics,"I got this for my kids thinking it was rock for kids(kid rock,get it?).Sadly,I was mistaken.This cd is an absolute waste and I just want to go over to Mr.Rock's house and put a few soap bars in his mouth.I don't how he got the little kid to sing those bad lyrics,but I find that preposterous.Anyone who listens to this should be ashamed and if you're a kid who's listening to this,go tell your mother so that she may burn it for you....that is all I have to say."
1,"""hardcore rock n roll?""","This is to Kathryn in St. Clair Michigan. To call this music ""hardcore rock n roll"", is a huge insult to what IS rock n roll.I'm not a fan of rap/hip hop or whatever it's called, and to be honest i'm sick of seeing people like this idolized just because they were on Mtv. This isn't hardcore. Blood for Blood is hardcore. Metal fans, all you'll find here is a bunch of Mtv horseshi* Don't waste your money on this. All the girls that like this album, we all know the real reason you like this... If this is what rock has de-evolved to, then it's no wonder they say ""rock is dead."""
2,Great Song!,"This cd is like the best! not, This music he sings is like annoying...his voice is annoying. The music he sings is ok but if you turn it up so loud, you can't hear yourself think. There are other songs that are better then this, try Eve6, Blink 182, Lit, and others. Also eat at Dippin Dots instead of Baskin-Robbins..."
2,no good,This CD is no good. The only good songs on it are numbers 1-3. The rest is trash. Kid Rock is no good and I wouldn't recomend him to anyone.
1,"Is this what ""rock"" has come to?","""Rap-metal"". Isn't that an oxymoron? Of course it is, yet many of the so-called rock bands around today fit that description. Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock, being the most obvious offendors. Trash like this album simply do not belong in the rock section at music stores, it is an insult to good music. The only reasons kids are buying this album like hotcakes is because a)the antichrist known as eMpTVy told them to b)because it has ""cuss words"" in it, that makes them feel like they are rebelling (listen to real heavy metal with language instead, Pantera, for example), and c)because it's played endlessly on the radio. Bawitdaba, what the hell is that? Lyrics in music used to mean something. Kids should stop listening to trash like this and read some lyrics by real rock poets such as Roger Waters and Neil Peart, and while they're at it, they should chance a listen at some of the few good bands left today such as Dream Theater and Gov't Mule."
3,Worth picking up,"'Bawitdaba' is one of the best singles of the year and easliy the best song on the CD. It is worth shelling out the $ for it, since many of the other songs are good. I liked 'Devil Without a Cause', 'Welcome 2 the Party', and 'Only God Knows Why'. One star docked for not putting a pedal steel guitar on 'God Knows Why'"
1,Just horrid,"I didn't like this cd. All the songs were terrible and sounded the same. I haven't heard The History of Rock (and I don't want to), but who does this nut sack think he is sampling Sad But True? That used to be a great song. I know one thing that's True is that kid rock is Sad."
3,Kid Rock- Devil Without a Cause,"In my personal opinion, the ONLY way to buy a music CD/DVD, is to get the ""TRUE"" Original!! I just love it, you learn a few new things every time you listen to it.Keep it up, good work!!Lea Ann"
5,DAAAAAAAAAAA BOMB,"It is the tightest Cd and and it is at the top with Limp Bizkit and Eminem. The lyrics are so tight but the thing is you DON""T BUY A KID ROCK OR AN EMINEM OR A LIMP BIZKIT CD FOR YOUR 12 YEAR OLD CHILDREN.That's why there is a PARENTAL ADVISORY on the CD.It is for MATURE TEENAGERS 13 YEAR OLD AND OLDER,PEOPLES.Use your heads!! THat is for all you people who bought the Cd for your 12 year and younger children. JUST CAUSE HIS NAME IS KID ROCK DOESN'T MEAN HIS MUSIC IS FOR YOUNGER KIDS.Also JUST BECAUSE EMINEM'S NAME IS LIKE THE CANDY DOESN'T MEAN HIS MUSIC IS SWEET FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN.13 YEARS AND OLDER.I think have made my point now."
4,Almost Perfect,"I bought this particular item a couple times now, it looks great and very colorful. If your a casual collector this one is for you.I would have given it a 5/5 BUT it does have a couple flaws I don't like.For example the ""hair tips"" at the top of her head tend to show signs of oily crud(plasticisers) almost immediatle. I had one that had part of this piece ""split/cut"" slightly but still attached. I did all I could to avoid this(cool temps/no sun) but still it happened.Second her face experssion is alittle boring.Other than that this figure is an easy sell."
1,This computer is garbage,"I have owned this computer for two months now. A week ago the machine suddenly froze and the display changed resolution and gave me a message that the display driver had stopped functioning normally. Since then I have spent countless hours running recovery programs to restore the C drive to its original configuration, reinstalling drivers and reloading software. The problem continues and has gotten worse. Three lengthy phone calls with Sony have resulted in zero improvement and only shrugged shoulders as to what might be wrong with the unit. Now they want it sent back to them (a process that will take one to two weeks with no assurance that they will be able to fix it).I purchased the unit because I travel a lot. It was lightweight and small and could be used on an airplane even if the guy in front of you put his seat back. The problem is that it doesn't work anywhere. I will never purchase another Sony computer product and I recommend that none of you do either."
5,I've been looking for this for 10+ years.,"I sold my vinyl of this about a decade ago assuming that it would be something I could find on CD. Thank God I found it. It isn't as brilliant as the early EPs, but it is amazing."
5,4DaddysPrincess,My little girl loved the rod & reel and caught a fish with her second cast. Not a bad little set-up.
2,Although I finished it; an annoying read.,"Perhaps this book would not have seemed so difficult to follow had I read the others in the series. As it was, I found it jumped around quite a bit, dropped references that were not followed up on and kept going over the same dialog. If our hero said ""damn it"" one more time, I would have to have thrown the book out the window. More creative dialog and better pacing would have made for an enjoyable, though not memorable, book."
4,Contemplating organizational change?,My Board of Directors found this book to be very helpful as we restructure two companies (each numbering over 500 employees). We were able to put existing skill sets to new uses while still making drastic changes in our organization. I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating change in your company or organization. Read this first!
5,A Must for Early Music Lovers!,"I bought this CD about a year ago, and truly enjoy going ""back in time"" as I listen to it. As a collector of medieval manuscripts and books, I listen to this CD while studying and admiring my collection. Each track truly adds that special touch of actually being there at the time these manuscripts were created. The vocals are authentically done, and the compilation of music from each country and century are beautifully arranged on this CD. Listen, and travel through three centuries with this CD, and you will surely be taken back to the court dances held inside, and outside, the ancient castles of those times."
4,nice looking sunglasses,"I'm a woman, but I think these would look just as great on a man. They're very comfortable -- don't slip down the nose or sit funny. However, I wish they came in a hardcase instead of a cloth bag -- I feel like I'm going to break them. Also, the 6.99 s/h fee is excessive."
4,Worked Fairly Well,Have a low profile Foxconn box running windows home server. Wanted to upgrade from the internal 100Mbs controller to a PCI 1000Mbs controller. This one fit in the box (which was the challenge) and so far performs reasonably well. It is about 3-4 times faster rather than the theoretical 10 times faster.
5,"Should be added to television library. Good, clean humor.",This is the type of video that any member of the family may enjoy. Humor covered every kind of situation that any one of us has encountered at some time in our lives. Nice to be able to laugh at ourselves through Frank Spencer. Michael Crawford proves to be an all around type of actor. Wish we could see him perform in the movie version of Phantom of the Opera. END
5,The complete police equipment one source document,"Finally, an easy to read, illustrated authority on the plethora of police and security systems and equipment in use today. Should be on the shelf of every law enforcement team in the US."
4,Concordia Self Help Study Bible,This is an excellent tool to help understand the Bible. Each verse or set of verses has an explanation underneath to further help you understand.
3,Good product for those with patience,"Excellent product for the price. Relatively easy to install but time consuming. Be careful if you have a beige interior, the tan color is a lot darker than it appears online. Feels great on steering wheel while driving."
2,didn't last long,I bought a couple with different sayings. An excellent idea and marketable product however the apron quality is poor and both aprons began losing the hem and fraying after first washing.
4,Fit my needs perfectly.,"Easy to install, and the instructions led me through all the way. Perfectly clear picture and reception, I don't have to do a thing after it does its initial scan for channels."
2,Poor-,"Not as good as Rabbit ears.Had $4 rabbit ears taped to roof and got better reception than this.It might be good in a more city enviornment with stations in different directions all around the user.All my stations are in 1 direction from me- 30 miles away.Does work as advertised- does change directions of pull with remote-Be aware that you can only use this WITH the powerd remote box and that you use the coax as the ""control"" wire to the antenna.Therefore you can only use on 1 Tv- ar you need to attach powered box -before- any splitters--------------(in my attick- where I cannot access the unit via remote)"
2,good sound but awful ergonomics,"The extension cord (included in the package) is nice, but the default plug is so short you essentially have to use the extension. The added weight tugs downward on the left earbud and makes it easy to have it become dislodged while walking around or jogging. The style is behind the head as opposed to each earbud having an equally long cord, and this places all the strain and weight of wearing it on one ear. For these reasons, I've found these annoying to wear. I would definitely not buy them again.The sound quality, however, is completely acceptable and I love the inside-the-ear fit. It really does cancel a good deal of noise, and the included earpieces make the likelihood of a good fit fairly high. The good sound and fit of these cannot, however, overcome their awful ergonomics. Look elsewhere."
1,Cheaply made - poor sound - no low end - DON'T BUY,"""High Quality"" ... What a joke! This are unquestionably the worst sounding headphones I have EVER purchased. There is no low-end whatsoever. I have tried all 3 earbuds...it doesn't make a difference, the sound is crap. I recently also purchased a pair of Sony MDR-J11G for less than the cost of these headphones. The sound is deep and rich and full, but the clips hurt my ears. That's why I was seeking a good earbud style headphone, but these aren't it. Also, the right ear cable is 17"" longer than the left. Clearly, no thought went into manufacturing this...total crap."
1,Required reading?,"My school, George Fox University, recommends (""hint"": requires) that all students read this book upon enrollment. This book might have been a valuable contribution to the public's outlook on character in public figures, but is incredibly dry and dull in presentation. These historical figures were real people who deserve a bit...well...a life. This book was written for a great purpose, but will never achieve a lasting impact on many people due to the poor judgment of the author in his choice of style of presentation.by a discouraged Freshman"
5,The sun shines through in Washington State,"Considering the recent news from Washington, DC, with scandal, failed trust and broken promises, it is a relief to read of a true optimist from Washington State who focuses on making his home state a better place for his children.Following Dino Rossi's narrow loss in the 2004 governor's race, and after three highly questionable recounts, he took some time to write a book about his life and his vision. After the closest loss in American gubernatorial history, it would be easy to imagine a person becoming embittered and focusing on the ""why me"" aspect of such a loss.Not this guy. His life story is inspirational, his work ethic and belief in the American system unshakable, and his vision for the future is compelling.I was pleased to read this book, and recommend it highly. For Dino Rossi and his family, the sun shines brightly, even on a cloudy Seattle day."
3,Wilber has no uderstanding of Buddhism,"Wilber is an intelligent man, but do not take this book or anything else he has written as a guide to understanding the Buddha, who, by the way, was a lot smarter than Wilber. His inability to deal with Theravada teachings is the result of his a)lack of reading in them and, b)inability to understand them. The Theravada is not the Mahayana, and unfortunately for the Mahayana, the Theravada has the claim of historic connnection to the Buddha. All the Bodhidharma stuff is no replacement for the Pali Suttas, and Wilber's attempt to synthesize everything is ill-fated from the beginning. His own stance being primarily mystical (with a decided Advaita-Vedanta and Mahayana slant) he cannot understand the Buddha, WHO WAS NOT A MYSTIC. Sorry, but I think Ken Wilber is doing a grave disservice to the Buddha's teachings, and anyone reading Wilber's books should know that he is not the last word."
2,"Nice story, disappointing album","""Psychic Cat"" has a nice story behind it - singer Kelli Ali leaves the Sneaker Pimps, goes on the dole, does soul-searching and travels for a while, eventually recording a solo album. While recording the album, she meets a Santa Monica street performer with a pair of psychic cats - hence, this album's title. Unfortunately, Ali's second solo effort is a bland electro-pop affair, falling somewhere between Avril Lavigne and Depeche Mode. Her voice is largely wasted on prosaic lyrics and safe production that connotes rather than conveys attitude. Pro Tools may make a singer, but it can also break one."
4,worth adding if you like kelli ali,"This album isn't as good as Tigermouth but is still worth the purchase. I found this album to have a more rock edge to it. Tigermouth is alot more downtempo than this album. If you like Kelli, this album belongs in your collection."
1,horrible!!!!,"Kaput after 11 months. Said I needed new printheads-- bought them for $100+. I live outside continental US & the printheads took weeks to get here. In the meantime my warranty expired. After replacing the printheads, printer still told me to replace them. I tried to explain the situation to HP-- they were completely unsympathic & unhelpful. Even before printgate, the machine would eat about half the prints I tried to make. I do not recommend & I now feel great animosity toward HP as well."
3,"Good printing, very poor paper handling","We have used the printer for 14 months. Although it prints well, its paper handling is the worst of any printer this office has employed. The most common problem is its failure to pick up sheets. A failure occurs almost every time that one reloads paper. Fixing the problem requires that the operator open the back of the printer, clean and adjust the pickup wheels. Changing paper therefore is very cumbersome. The printer also commonly picks up two sheets simultaneously or mangles a sheet. These occur frequently enough that one cannot leave it working while unattended.HP's technical support has consisted primarily of offering unsuccessful suggestions and evading requests for a service call or exchange."
4,CP1700 working for a year and a half.,"It has been a good printer for me. I don't use it very hard; it is printing for a family of 4, and this is an office printer. Photo quality is good, although I bet it can be equaled for a lot less. Graphics printing and everyday printing are also good. The 17 inch capability has been nice for a few big jobs, and some folded newsletters. The big ink cartridges really do go for a long time- I'm still on my first set of color cartridges.My complaint is with the WinXP network compatibility, which is or was poor, and the lack of network setup software."
1,hp cp 1700 failed for no reason,"WARNING!!! Do not buy this printer. When new it works great but from other comments I've read and from my own experience, this printer has no durability and HP doesn't want to help. I got this printer to print maps in large format sizes. I hardly used the printer for anything else over the past two years. Recently I replaced the print heads due to very poor print quality and no color reproduction. The printer stopped working after that and HP technical support couldn't help me. They offered me a trade-in deal for a refurbished printer (same model) for $380.00 or a new CP 1700 for an ""upgrade"" price of $499.00 plus I would have to send them my printer. Of course, I could send it in to have it repaired in 7 - 10 days for $275.00. Whatever your needs, don't do it. Don't buy this printer. Shame on HP for making such a poor product and not standing behind their products!"
1,DIED IN 1 YEAR!!!!,"This printer went to the garbage can within 1 year of us recieving it at our small architectural firm. Oh yes, it was a dream come true for the first 8 or 9 months, then slowly started deteriorating little by little, then one day (about 1 month after our warranty ended) it decided to stop working. HP will replace it for $400 (I can buy a new one for that)...not that I would want to. I called Tech Support...they were no help, and after calling several local companies that work on printers I was told to ""just throw it away"" There goes $500 down the drain....THANKS FOR NOTHING HP....On to EPSON :)"
4,Good Stuff,"This group may not be well known, but they make some good hip hop music. This cd has a mixture of rap and r&b, but it's all with a message about God, which makes it that much better. They kinda have a cross movement style of rapping, which I like. I recommend everyone buy this album."
1,"DAV FC9, caveat emptor","I had my ""dream"" system for less than two years when it seized up, flashing ""Stand By"" and it would not reset. I called Sony and went to a local/approved technician who still had to ship it back to the manufacturing plant. I have been without a DVD/CD system for 4 weeks now and do not have a commitment to get it back. The latest estimate is $300 to fix it, not covered by warranty. I should've stuck with RCA, my previous system was 15 years old and still functioning. Sony's dream is my nightmare. Do not buy it."
2,very slow,"Overall the system is nice: it sounds fine for a low end system and the picture quality is fine. But I hate using it as a CD player. It takes forever to switch between disks, about 30 seconds. Loading or ejecting a disk take even longer. There is no way to tell what disks are loaded in the machine, and you cannot change one disk while it is playing another. These seem like minor things, but when you walk in to the room and turn on the stereo to listen to some music they add up to a 5 minute delay before you are actually listening to anything. Bleh. If I had it to do over I would get a system like my older one that just has a big tray instead of the fancy slot loader. I guess the people at Sony put looks ahead of function on this one."
3,OK but not perfect,"The caddy looks very nice and will be useful. But it has a couple of problems which weren't apparent from the description.It only holds about 8 of my forks, etc, in each stack. I don't think my flatware is unusual. The handles are thicker than the tines of the forks and the bowls of the spoons. So when I put them in the caddy, the stack begins to slant more with each additional piece in the stack. By the time I have 8 in the stack, the slant is steep enough that the next one tends to slide out.The knives are put into the caddy at an angle, with some pointing towards one side of the caddy and some towards the other. The problem is that there isn't a notch where the handle rests, so the knives tend to flop around when bumped even very gently as they are when someone picks up another of the knives."
3,Not the best.,"This secretary's desk is wonderful for small spaces. However, the writing area does not have sufficient support and it will begin to slant downwards over time."
4,Nice multi-purpose printer,"I bought this printer as a photo printer, everyday printer, and for the occasional newsletter.The photo quality is as good as I've seen on any printer in this price range and it prints relatively quicker than some.The text printing is exceptional and again doesn't take much time.The printer is much quieter than the Epson I had previously and the lower paper feed is a better design.Setup wasn't as easy for my iMac. It took about an hour to get it properly working vs. 10 minutes with the Epson. Although some of the config settings with the Epson conflicted with the HP, so most people probably won't run into this issue. Furthermore, if HP support was open I would have had the issue resolved much quicker.Overall, good quality printer, quiet, and does everything well."
1,Availability,This item was ordered 8/3/2002 and still have not received this item as of 8/27/2002.NOW they tell me it is on a first order basis!So how far down on the list am I?
4,Excellent story about a cop gone bad,"My interest in this story is due to one of the murders that Leasure committed took place a few blocks from my home. When the 1980 beauty shop killing occurred, it shook the community for how random and senseless it was. I also knew an LAPD officer who was close friends with Leasure and who was really shocked when all this came out. The story is full of great details, and is a must read for people who love true crime tales, or anyone who wants to keep up on any non-fiction having to do with Los Angeles."
4,Cecily blacksmith,when i first saw this series i like it but it just gave me a cliff hanger from episode 12 so i wonder if a 2nd season will be made
2,Not so much,"I could only read 60% and that was a struggle. I just couldn't bond with the main character Doria Lennox. She had no emotions and seemed very distracted. As a private detective, she never knew when people were tailing her and when she was going to get jumped. It made the book totally unbelievable."
2,Bad Shape,"The Dvds stiil play but when they were delivered to me, TWO of the four dvd set were out of the safety pocket of the box, so those dvds are truly scratched because of the movement."
1,VHS or DVD?,"Why are all the reviews here for the DVD (spanish, apparently) when the product description above CLEARLY states [VHS] after the title?"
2,Misunderstanding,"Not realizing that this Latin import was dubbed only in Spanish I had no choice but to return it. I wish that there was something in the description outlining this fact. I had to get the more expensive version which is in several languages including English & Spanish. Love the show, not the import!Wayne R. Boss"
1,When?,Still waiting....? Another failed post-cold war attempt at 'Mr X' (or Mr and Mrs X??) status...
4,"Good value, solid product","Purchased this keyboard because I was replacing a compaq wireless keyboard and mouse combo where the mouse had stopped working. The key placement takes a little getting used to if you had been using a non ergonomic keyboard previously, but it is not as bad as those split keyboards you see that are ""true ergonomic"". The mouse has a good feel and the buttons are well positioned to me, lots of options for button remapping, even by application, so depending on the program your using, each button can have a different function. The keyboard is super quiet, but has a good solid key feel and good feedback when pressing a button, you know that you've hit it. My only con for this keyboard, is that with the way the keys are recessed inside the trim bezel, I seem to accidentally turn on the caps lock or hit the shift key under the enter, I figure this is something I can learn to avoid as I use the keyboard more."
2,"Looks good, performs bad.","Mouse was erratic in response despite location of receiver and utilizing several different surfaces. Keyboard performed similarly, missing keystrokes or repeating them. Left control key is moved too far left and sunken causing issues playing FPS's."
4,Expensive little piece of plastic,"This expensive little piece of plastic does its job (paid $4). When my wife saw it she laughed and said, ""I'm sure we could have come up with something for free that did the same thing."" We probably could have, but we didn't. We got this instead, and we're satisfied."
4,Not sure how long will last.,"It is small on my door and I have to put some pressure to adjust it to the door. I'm not sure with a few pressure this will resist or will break, but for now it works just fine for me ."
3,You may need 2 packages,"I purchased this lock awhile ago and finally got around to putting it on my toddler's closet door. I was a bit disappointed to discover that I need 2 packages. You need a package for each fold in the door. Most closets have 2 doors, and therefore 2 folds. I read some other reviewers that were disappointed with the product because it sounded like they were trying to place the product where the doors meet. It won't work that way. They need to be over the fold. The first one worked perfectly, but I only have one door locked. So, here I am back to buy the second."
1,Bad Value,"Each package only contains one lock. Most bifold doors will need 2 of these. This makes them very expensive. They should come 2 to a package. Also, there are no clear instructions included."
3,D.B. Cooper: The Real McCoy,"I have not read this book, although I have done extensive research on D.B. Cooper and Richard McCoy Jr. and I had read in my research that Richard McCoy Jr. was sentenced to 45 years in 1972 for hijacking and endangering the crew. I never heard that he had been shot, and would like to find out more. I will most definately be buying this book, but I just wanted to get the word out there."
4,South Louisiana Indie Pop,"You get what you expect from Baton Rouge LA's latest indie pop export. Upbeat, hook laden, good times.GEAUX CAJUNS!"
1,WOW......,Cathy Burns is a wack job.. AA is a progam that saved my life ...Just as Jesus did.. she would have probably been right there crucifying Jesus for talking to the prostitute and tax collector..
1,Secular Psychologist Point of View,"A Biased account of what really happens in AA, which may not be for everyone, but it worked for me."
1,Attention fellow AA's. Read the 10th Tradition.,"The program of Alcoholics Anonymous has helped me stop drinking and start to lead a spiritual life. Ms. Burns must have had a negative experience with people close to her and felt it necessary to write a book to help sooth her mind. For my fellow AA's, read the 5th Tradition-the primary purpose of the program is to be sober and help other still suffering alcoholics, and the 10th Tradition-we don't get involved in outside issues. Dwelling on trashy books doesn't keep us sober. Go out and help a fresh drunk. God bless those of you with decades of sobriety. I'm 15 months sober and absolutely love the new way of life and so do all of those close to me. ""Let's Keep the Main Thing, the Main Thing!"""
2,Image problem: Sownward vertical shift via HDMI when up-secalling,"This DVD player had one major issue.When up-scalling to 720p or 1080i, which should be the reason why you are purchasing a DVD player with HDMI, you will notice a vertical shift. The image actually gets pushed down, from the top. On the top of your TV you will have a 1/2-inch to a 1-inch black line, depending on which resolution you are up-scalling to. This means that the bottom is getting pushed down, so you are missing part of the picture.People have tried to contact Sony support to no avail. Sony refuses to acknowladge the problem, and turns people away.If this issue did not exist, this could be the best DVD player on the market. The picture quality is outstanding over HDMI with upscalling, and it's also very good at 480p.Unfortunately, since Sony is likely to keep ignoring people, mine will be returned, and I will have to settle for a lesser unit.Hope that this has helled, and maybe even saved you a headache."
5,good movie,This movie made me want to go out and eat sushi. I did and it was great but I was left wondering what Jiros sushi tasted like.
2,"Quality Subject, Poor Film","The democratization of film making has led to a number of documentaries with great subjects made by sub par directors. I wish I could share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers, but I found this narrative felt like a bad soap opera from the 1980s. It felt like the director was trying to impose the story on the viewer and stretch the length of the film to a running time that would allow it to be shown in theaters. I only wonder what it would have looked like under more capable hands, like Errol Morris or Frederick Wiseman. They would have at least been able to draw out aspects of the lives of this extended family other than a second-rate Shakespearean tragedy."
5,Sushi lovers must watch!,Awesome documentary about a world renown sushi chef! One of the few restaurant in the world that has 3 Michelin rated.
3,Better if you speak Japanese.,"Jiro is very interesting, and so are his philosophies. That being said, this film did not live up to the hype. It is very difficult to read white subtitles for 80 minutes on a white background. Who's brilliant idea was that?"
3,Survivor Series 99',"WWF has for the first time ever done done a scrwejob to thier fanz! the advertising match waz austin vs. triple h vs.the rock.But 1 hour and ten minutes into the ppv, austin gets hit by a car.what's kool though, iz austin nor rock or triple h winz. who winz? find out for your self.the survivor series matches or 8 man elimenation matches,were all boring , exept the short ones and the posse , bulldog vs blackman,gangrel,m.henry,and val venis match.the main event iz pretty good , too!"
2,WWF cheated - the ref probably had his back turned!,"I can't believe it, the WWF actually tried to cheat their fans by promoting a match, Austin vs. HHH vs. The Rock, on every possible outlet available, RAW, Smackdown! and even one hour before the pay-per-view on HeAT... only to have Austin ""run over"" half way threw the event and being replaced by The Big Show. Thousands of people were cheated out of their hard-earned cash live, don't be stupid enough to buy this terrible video. The Survivor-rules matches were awful, each one being announced a week before the event with no apparent storylines or build-up. What a waste. If you wanna see great Survivor Series matches buy some of the earlier ones, if you wanna see great three-way dances for the WWF title buy Summerslam (both 1999 and 2000) or Breakdown 1998 - not this!"
5,Great Filter.,"I have A Nikon D40 and this filter works quite well. I haven't had much time to mess with it yet, but I have taken a few pictures, and they are coming out interesting! This is going to be fun!"
3,Computer Microphone,"This product is working just fine. For the price I paid for it, I did not expect any better performance.The micriphone was delivered on time and I was pleased."
4,Great powder! It's vanilla flavor,"I love this protein powder. Blends VERY well, and tastes great. It's unsweetened, which is good because I like to add my OWN sweetner (stevia) to taste. It's really hard to find unsweetened rice protein, and I'm very appy to have found this one.My only issues are:1) It's vanilla flavor (this particular Amazon product)... not chocolate. It would be nice if they specified that. I prefer the chocolate flavor.2) It doesn't include a scoopMy morning smoothie recipe:1 serving Jarrow powder1 cup of almond milk1/4-1/2 tspn of stevia1 tspn of unsweetened cocoa1/2 banana1/4 scoop of Garden Of Life Super Seed (fiber)1 tspn ground flaxseedsiceblendIf I didn't already regularly eat (too many) almonds, I would add almonds to it, too. If I'm super tired, I add 1/4 tspn of instant coffee."
4,Right On! Training in Personal Ethics Greatly Needed,"Great book, except for all the proofreader oversights in my copy, i.e., misspellings, extra words, transpositions, etc. I hope the next edition is much improved in this area.Callahan hits one problem right on the head: training in personal ethics, personal integrity, and personal character are greatly lacking in our educational system. The problem is perpetuated because many parents don't fully understand this lack of training. I wish the author had spent more time on this and how the development of spiritual values might be the answer for many who are brought up in a faith-based environment.I hope that Mr. Callahan will bring out new editions of this book every three to five years. It is that good!Business Ethics programs in colleges and universities around the country should find it to be a great resource."
2,Cut N Paste News,"In Robert Altmans ""The Player"", the brash new producer picks up a newspaper and describes how headlines could be used alone for movie scripts, rendering writers obsolete. The Cheating Culture reads like a cut and paste from headlines over the last 10 years relative to nefarious characters caught in the act. After a review of news items, the book descends into a laughable thesis of ""how to fix everything"". It's in this section that the author abandons the interesting material, reminding me of a passable cover band deciding it's time to play their originals. Do yourself a favor and watch or read the frontline.org programs on the same topics, with much greater depth."
2,Too many cheapshots,"Only a moderately good book. There are only a couple of chapters worth reading. Too much of the book is dedicated at taking cheapshots at people (namely the rich). David blames the inequality between the rich and the poor as the source of cheating, but what ever happened to individual responsibility? Also, he provides no reasonable solution to the problem."
1,Blatantly Political,"I was disappointed with this book because I was expecting a sociological, scientific study on this interesting topic, and instead read 250 pages of extremely politically slanted material. He basically blames cheating on capitalism, whines on every page about how it isn't fair that some people are rich and some are poor, and then spends the final chapter promoting ideas for a socialist government. Great - if you lean that way. This book is about politics and the economy - not about cheating as a scientific study."
4,Excellent Rock,"Paul Rodgers ""Live in Glasgow"", is an excellent concert. Paul's band covers many of the old hits from ""Free"" and also Bad Company. Paul is one of the best Rock singers of all time, and his band does a great job. You will not be disappointed."
5,Great light bag.,"The double end feature helps make up for the 40lb thing. I am used to 100lb so it swings a quite a bit. Very solid product, never had problems in a couple years of use. You'll love it if you can't have something heavier because of lack of a strong roof or if you are a smaller fighter."
5,Great bag,"I'm 240 pounds, and this bag can stand up to anything i throw at it. I even pound on it with a side-handle baton without worrying about damaging the bag. I've got it mounted to the ceiling in my garage with one of the Balazs Bag mounts, and since the bag is so heavy, it doesn't shake my whole house when I kick it. I had a 60 pound bag that was too light weight. If you can hit hard get a 100+ pound heavy bag or you'll regret it."
3,Gives you what you pay for..,"Not much of an advanced book, however if you are switching between programming languages and want to get back in java, it helps you jump right in. All the code typed in by me compiles without a problem. the answer lies at javasoft where you can check the current implementations to the java language. Those readers having a problem compiling the code should first check their code for minor bugs and if everthing is bug free, check at javasoft."
2,Somewhat amusing but not very helpful,The code used in the lessons is outdated and won't even compile in many cases. The so-called 1 hour lessons take several hours to complete. I usually just gave up and went to the next lesson! Not a very good way to learn programming.
2,A Bad Man,"I read the book because I had heard good things about it. I was disgusted by what I saw. I've always been a moderate, so this is not the ramblings of some right wing nut who just hates liberals. Ted Rall hates America with an almost satanic passion. After reading the book, I went online and searched for Ted Rall's cartoons. These cartoons are even worse than the book. He advocates the deaths of our soldiers and makes one cartoon actually claimed that ALL soldiers are rapists and sadists. Ted Rall is a sick and twisted human being. Do not send any of your money to this sadistic and anti-american nut."
5,No-holds-barred guide to Las Vegas,"A wealth of info presented from a fresh and cheeky point of view. Jordan Simon clues you in to what Vegas' many promoters don't want you to know, but don't get the idea that this ""Irreverent Guide"" exists solely to take potshots at the excess that is the essence of Vegas' singular charm; the writer duly awards praise where he thinks praise is warranted. As it happens, I personally have not been to Vegas in about 30 years, but Simon's style pulled me in immediately and I have no doubt his offbeat guide will prove very useful when I do visit.I have a couple of small quibbles - the info could be presented in more of an outline, organized form, but that's really a minor complaint, as the hip narrative style is very entertaining; and I'd love some photos, but one can get all the Las Vegas one could ever want various places online. If your preferences tend towards the unconventional, this is the Las Vegas guide to get."
2,somewhat helpful,this book was helpful only because it was the most recent book printed i could locate(and still not new enough). It is no better than any other book on las vegas i have read (which is about 4). i do like the size and shape however and the print is easy to look at. much of the information is repeated throughout the book 2 or 3 times as it is nicely cross-referenced.
3,"High School Students, this is a good choice to impress","a teacher or two...A warm book, gentle like steel. Excellent storytelling, enough historical fiction to warrant a multiple-read. A good group discussion book, begs to be talked about late into the night."
2,"Ok, we get it. You have nice hair.","She's pretty, it's true. And that's the extent of the good things I have to say about this DVD. I plugged it into the DVD player, walked off to grab something, then came back and stared as I watched what could only be described as something that made me say, ""really?"" over and over. The choreography consisted of a lot of hair flinging and cheesy moves. Period. I believe she has talent to an extent, and this DVD could have been SO much better. Maybe she MEANT it to look more like a stripper's belly dance? I don't know. It'll never be inserted into my DVD player again, that's all I know."
4,"Wonderful story, lovely family","I was fortunate to meet Julian P. Van Winkel III at a whiskey tasting in San Francisco. I tasted his whiskies, bought his sister's book (he was kind enough to add his signature to the author's), and then his wife invited me to ""come see us in Kentucky"". Friendliest folks I've ever met. Damn fine book, too."
3,"Interesting facts, not the best writing in the world...","I would recommend this book to anyone who is into bourbon, solely for historical reasons. If you can afford the coffee table book, then I'd definitely pick this up. If you are reading electronically, then I'd say it's short enough to get through in just a few days, so it's not too bad."
2,Poor Over-Bulky Design,"I bought several of these because I was looking for stain-resistant food storage ie. something that could handle tomato sauce. These monstrosities are ridiculously too bulky. The lids are unnecessary thick and large, and certainly not for you if you wanna space-save. I also don't like the design it self of these containers. There are so many unnecessary edges and crevices that make it such that water does drain off of them in the dishwasher, making for pools of water to be found on them at any angle or lots of water in the crevices of the lid. I'm storing food here, not plutonium. I'm going back to my Take A-longs."
2,Just wait untill the cracks start...,"I WAS very happy with these until the bowls starting cracking, one by one during normal (Microwave, dishwasher, fridge) use. Rubbermaid was not very helpful, you need to return the bowl for them to evaluate it (shipping cost is more than buying a new bowl). My 15+ year old Tupperware is still going strong."
2,Not as good as vols 1 & 2,I love running to the Marine Corps Cadence CDs. Volumes 1 and 2 are very good. Volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral. When running vols 1 & 2 are better synched for continuous running. The transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me. Others don't seem to agree and I still run to this CD; I'd buy 1 and 2 first if you don't have them.
1,Ridiculous,"It turns out this book is about anagrams; it is not a deep exploration of Lewis Carroll's life. Supposedly, Charles Dodgson AKA Lewis Carroll used anagrams to encode homosexual messages into his work. A quick trip to anagramfun.com convinced me that one can find anagrams for anything in anything. I even found a clever one for the title of this work, which amazon.com won't let me print."
2,Not the best,"My 11 month old got this for Christmas. Although Pooh does say her name correctly (and it isn't common) when he says it as part of play it is very distinct from the rest of the words (it kind of reminds me of ""Hello Clarice""). Though many songs and games can potentially be downloaded, Pooh can only remember any three at a time so be prepared to change them often. Also, the sound is just in a little speaker box inside the bear so it doesn't really seem like the bear is talking. Finally on a safety note, I think that any toddler will be able to figure out how to pull the speaker box out of the bear and break the wires. Not recommended."
2,most difficult ee book I have ever seen,This book literally has more equations than text. Maybe thatsthe nature of the subject but I think more spoken word wouldhave helped. Not a book for self study.
4,Good reference for new RVers.,"This book is a good reference for new RVers. Has a lot of good information, lists, and vacation plans."
1,for Dummies is Right,Guess you really have to be at the bottom of the rving barrell to get anything out of this book.
3,Same book as Frommer's book.,"FYI: This book and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764565958/ref=pd_sim_b_5/102-9284563-0390536?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance"">Frommer's Exploring America by RV (2nd Edition)</a> are identical books."
3,"cute, but not big enough","This was a really cute handbag, but we really thought it would be bigger. It barely holds a wallet, keys and one other item. It wasn't worth the $30."
2,Worked fine the first 4 months... then stopped.,"I purchased this adapter to use with my Slingbox. It was easy to set up and I was able to get it up and running within minutes after connecting all the cables. The unit worked fine for the first four months, then the power light on the unit would not turn on. I contacted support to order a new power cord, as it was still under warranty. They would not provide the part and told me to go to Radio Shack to purchase a new cord. After dropping another $20 for a new power cord, the unit is working again. I was not at all impressed with Linksys or their customer support. I do not plan to buy from Linksys again."
3,Good but drops signal over time,"You can read other reviews about setting this up. I have no issues with the product for over a year, but now it is becoming less and less reliable. The signal is dropped daily (it is 100% strength when it works) and the only thing that seems to work now is re-booting the hardware and getting the xbox to re-connect to the signal. Annoying.In addition, the box runs very hot. I am wondering if that is connected to the dropped signal."
2,Linksys Game Adapter Needs work,"I went the Linksys route for the same reason other did - the name. Don't let that sway you too much. Like many others I had a difficult time getting the game adaptor to talk to the router. I tried several of the approaches suggested in these reviews. After several hours of attempts, I gave up and decided to try another vendor. I went with a D-Link wireless router, game adapter and USB wireless adaptor. The PC OS' are all XP SP2 as well as a PS2 console.Total setup up time was 1 to 1 1/2 hours which included making sure all the connections worked without encryption and then going back and adding encryption. (To be fair, I didn't do this with the Linksys but I suspect it wouldn't have made any difference. The interface between the wireless router and the game adapter is very flaky.)"
2,Does not work with WPA-PSK,"I recently purchased one of these at the local Fry's electronics. It is the version 2.1, with firmware 1.16, Mar 29 2005.I configured it using the built in web interface, not the CD. The unit appears to work fine with either NO security, or with WEP.Even though there is an option for WPA-PSK in the configuration pages, IT DOES NOT WORK. This was confirmed by Linksys technical support. There is no firmware fix for it at this time. They were ready to give me an RMA, however I decided to return it to the store and find another product that does support WPA."
2,"Linksys needs to listen to the customers, not just their Marketing team","There is still no WPA2/AES support, even on the latest hardware version 2.1. Linksys site still only carries hardware version up to 2.0 with a firmware released in 2005. There is a lot of new devices out there today like Blue Ray players that can use a secure and affordable Ethernet to wireless adapter. That's an indication that they are still stuck with only gaming in mind, do not pay any attention to this development and the current market at all. Linksys tech support cannot help and obviously their engineering team isn't listening either. If you are serious about wireless security even for home, this is probably not the choice until they close this gap."
3,Setup is Hard. But don't give up.,Obviously if you are reading some of these reviews you can tell that the setup can be very difficult sometimes. However if you work at it it is very possible to figure out how to use. Once set up it works very well.
4,Simple solution for wireless printing.,"What do you do when your network capable printer only has an ethernet (RJ-45) port and you can't find a wireless print controller that outputs to anything other than USB?Plug one of these babies in. Spend a couple of minutes configuring it and then print to your little heart's content.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 becuase the sparse printed documentation makes no mention of the extensive .pdf documentation included on the CD. Configuration is easy once you refer to the .pdf manual, but it would be nice to have the printed setup guide tell you there is more info on the CD."
1,Beware of this product!,"My entire network at home is Linksys wireless, so I assumed this product had the quality of the rest of the components. After 5 hours of trying EVERYTHING, I called Linksys tech support. The person was polite, but spoke broken English. After 90 more minutes, we gave up. I am a Microsoft Certified guy with a pretty deep understanding of networking, but this wireless adapter just would not work.As for me, I turned off WEP, SSID hiding, and every other option. Yes, I also upgraded the firmware to 1.10 as well, but to no avail. The documentation is poor and the Linksys website is technically weak. If you have a lot of time, take the risk with this product. If not, then look elsewhere."
2,"Poor support, poor instructions but it worked finally!!!!","I brought the Games Adapter last week and I had been experiencing problems trying to configure it. I went through most of the difficulties described by fellow reviewers but in summary this is how I got it to work. Basically you need to run the CD!!! It didn't work on my Toshiba laptop at all so I tried configuring it through the web browser to no avail. I connected my PS2 to my modem directly just to check the damn thing was working; used all the auto settings an dit worked!! I finally tried it on my desktop and it seemed to recognise the games adapter using the CD. After that I was able to whizz through Central Station. Its working fine now but I want to know why Linksys Support is so poor and documentation so unhelpful.I hope you don't have to go through what I went through. Just make sure you run the CD successfully, even if that means going to your mates house!!!"
1,"A poor, brainwashed Canadian..","And ever since she got her bill passed, check out the crime increase in Canada.."
2,Better looking than they are wearing,"These are not so comfortable. After you go to the trouble to get into these it's as if they stuck a flat piece of cardboard inside for the footbed and another for the outsole, There isnt really space to add an innersole for support or comfort. Well let me stop here i may want to sell my hardly worn ones on ebay. Davey Daveeeyyyy crocket.."
2,Not very pleased,"I'm very dissapointed with the hype of Minnetonka. First I bought the color in black and when I recieved it, it was very dark greyish. The laces aren't even durable, they broke within a week for me. Also, I bought an 8.5 and it looked and felt two sizes too big.I'm warning you that these boots are hard to break in. I wore them for an entire month and I continously had blisters on my ankles. I couldn't even wear them for 4 hours without them hurting. I know that now I will never buy another pair of shoes from this brand. I always hear how great it is, definitely not worth the money."
3,Not an X-File,It was an OK movie but it wasn't the X-Files. It stars people from the X-Files but it really was it's own movie. I gotta say I was disappointed because I really wanted them to fix the whole everything after season 6 not making sense thing but alas I guess I'll just have to keep pretending those last three seasons never happened.
3,I was expecting more but it was good.,I was expecting more from this movie like the first one they made. This was more psychological and medical than extraterrestrial. It was a pretty good movie and not too predictable but it could have been more exciting.
1,bad x,I am a big X-Files fan but I feel like my time and money was wasted. The story was not a X-file story or anything thing like one. Thst must have made it just for the money.
1,X-FILES.... I WANT TO TURN IT OFF,"I am going to make this review short and sweet.I have rarely turned off movies and not watched the end.And being a fan of the show and the first movie I did just that with 30 min to go.Besides Mulder and Scully's characters this was some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a big screen film.This movie is NOT GOOD, do not waste your time or money, you will be extremely dissapointed."
3,Has Run Its Course...........Barely 3 stars,"Maybe its been too long since the X Files series, but I just couldn't get into this one. It seemed like a made for TV movie. Just couldn't get into the story line. The whole two headed dog thing was just too far out there. I think its time to say goodbye X Files, for good."
2,very dissapointed,"I didn't expect much, from other reviews, but still it was disappointing.Like watching a single x-files episode - one which didn't advance the underlying story line."
2,A Disappointing Sequel,"I have owned ""The X Files"" the movie for years on LaserDisc and have enjoyed watching the movie many times over the years. I was hoping that this movie could live up to the original but was very disappointed to discover that it was in no way equal and actually fell short by a wide margin.The movie falls victim to entirely too many clichés and winds up a rather pathetic horror flick. I will not watch it again and caution any fan of X-Files to proceed with great caution."
2,Disappointed,"If you were hoping for more ET, monsters, etc.....forget it. They are not in this movie. While the movie is not horrible I give it 2 stars because when I think X-Files.....I think of paranormal/ET/etc., not some nasty russians in a body chop shop. Worse, the mushy scenes between Muldar and Scully feel very forced and unnatural like they were forced into the script. I could understand this script for a TV episode but not for the big screen."
2,Very disappointing ending to the series,"I have been a fan of the X-Files for a very long time, own the entire series, and have a great love for the work of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson--but this movie was BAD. The writers made a huge jump in the lives of Mulder and Scully without ever satisfactorily explaining the events between this and the end of the series. Their attempt to make the relationship problems between Mulder and Scully dramatic was ineffective at best, if not laughable. I don't know if the two actors simply lost their chemistry or whether the internal conflicts ruined the idea that they could have fulfilling life together. The plot was very non-X-Files, the psychic character that was supposed to carry the movie was completely one-dimensional, and the snowy and frigid landscape for the entire movie made it especially sleep-inducing. I think I would rather forget that this movie was made than know it is the last testament of the X-Files."
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"After just having completed watching the series in its entirety, my wife and I eagerly anticipated the final movie ""I Want To Believe"". We avoided any spoilers, we wanted to be surprised by this movie as we expected it was going to finally answer questions about the December 22, 2012 invasion date, super soldiers, black oil, and aliens. Instead, we were supremely disappointed when the final X-Files movie had absolutely nothing to do with the series storyline whatsoever. It wasn't a bad story but it could have been alot better and it could have answered questions left by the demise of the series with Season 9.We are extremely disappointed that none of these questions were answered in this movie. -kd5-"
1,Disappointment,"I so looked forward to seeing this movie because I had been watching ""X-Files"" from the first episode and am such a fan. Unfortunately, I suppose the writers had done all they could do and explored all they could in the series because the plot of this movie is so dull, so overdone. I was expecting the big issues to be covered and all this movie has is a dime-a-dozen run-of-the-mill psychic. RIP, X-Files: you're done."
1,Worse than even the weakest TV episode,"This is the most disappointing, horrible thing they could have done with the X-Files. It has nothing to do with aliens or the supernatural or anything even remotely unusual. I can't express how bad this was. Seriously, this movie is like defiling a corpse."
5,A voice matured like a classic wine.,"The voice has matured like a classic wine and from the opening bars of ""Something Burning Out"" it captures the ear and the emotion. Tilli takes us on a journey through the powerful ""Train without a Whistle"", the out there ""Crazy by Myself"" and her own ""The Hard Way"". Unlike a classic wine you can consume more and more of this CD without getting a hangover!"
1,a terrible textbook,"This book was one of the worst text books I have ever read. Many of its sources were outdated. It failed to give a complete review of the field, neglecting several important theories. It also failed to discuss even the slightest hint of research that supports or challenges the theories it does discuss. Furthermore, it is not only biased but fails to give a comprehensive discussion of the subjects in which it has a bias preventing the reader from making an informed opinion."
1,Unreliable,"I own three Drobos. In the last 2 months, two of them have failed; one terminally so, taking with it ~1TB of data. (The other required a series of reboots and rebuilds before the data was accessible again, the whole process took almost 3 weeks.) The worst part: Drobo Customer Support is unreachable, non-responsive, and generally unhelpful.When it works, it's fine. When it breaks, there's nothing you can do. Unfortunately, it seems there is a lot that can cause it to break (even specific brands and models of HDDs seem to be incompatible -- although one can only find out after owning a Drobo and accessing the User Forums part of the website...)Great concept, lousy execution, even worse support. Avoid."
3,Good but Pricey !!.. Don't pay over $300 for this,"After using it for 2 weeks, I had difficult time justifying the price of $500 I paid.Wait and very soon, you will get this for under $300.."
4,Mr. B could sing,"""1947"" was obviously a good year for Billy Eckstine. it certainly sounds good. If you like Billy Eckstine's style of singing, you won't be disappointed by this CD. It contains such standards as ""What's New,"" ""Sophisicated Lady,"" and ""Fools Rush in"" with the smooth, deep tone that makes his sound so unique. Of course, he does that with all of the songs on this disc."
1,There's no accounting for taste.,"This album was being given away free at the Oregon Country Fair. We paid too much. This is the story of a ram being chased and eaten by wolves, told in recited poetry with singing interludes. The poetry is fair, the singing is abysmal. It has become a joke gift among our friends. We have 2 copies that make the rounds and are given for birthday presents. Not one person yet has liked it."
2,An interesting failure,"Trying to refresh the heavy sound of the band, Hammill tried to add a violin and a cello to the band. It was both - interesting and brave idea, but the result was... mmmm... how to say it... not worth more than 2 stars. In other words - this time Hammill failed and VdGG had much better albums than that"
4,"About bears, dignity, survival and a man with his demons",Doug Peacock drew me into his world with grace. He describes a female Grizzly protecting her cubs from the onslaught of a male rogue Grizzly where just before her neck will be broken by his bite she turns her head away and the rogue stops his attack and walks away. The author picks up on this and uses it to calm another Grizzly in his path. What stories!! Along with the adventure the author is honest enough to show his demons and I ache when it's obvious that he doesn't know how to continue in a relationship with his loved one. Read this book uniterrupted
5,An excellent book.,I thought that Doug Peacock's book was excellent it had great descriptions and excellent examples. Doug Peacock is a excellent writer and an excellent naturalist.
2,Introductory reading,"The book seems ok for those who want a basic, cursory overview of many blunders, but a well-read student of war strategy would be very disappointed. A large problem, especially in a basic text, is that the writings were not accompanied by sufficient diagrams and graphics. This is especially evident when the minutia of troop movements and geographies are discussed."
2,Incomplete book,"This book certainly has some very good parts, but others are incredibly poor. I have to admit that 'unleashing' Java must be a huge job, but still. Like a reader said, this book tries to be too many books in one.I bought it as a reference, but it's hardly usable for that purpose. When I look up methods, I often only find them mentioned in the text, without a single word of explanation.It's a good book if you only have very basic skills of Java, and want to find out what you can really do with it (if more than 1000 pages in 56 chapters don't discourage you). In that way 'Java Explored' might be a better title."
1,Makes a great book end to hold up your more useful books,"I purchased this book many months ago and have found that it is barely better than viewing the Java API docs on-line. Thus, it is almost never removed from the shelf to help in coding situations as there is always a better book available. I also purchased Jaworski's Java 2 Certification book which is also a disaster of a book with numerous errors. Given these two unsuccessful Jaworksi buys, I think I will avoid books containing his name from now on...."
3,a book with a conceptual error,"try the listing 17.15 on p453, you would get a compiling error: constant expression required."
5,Face The Music NKOTB,"I was pleased with this item. It was new, and unopened, but the inside of the case was busted. It did not cause any problems with the CD though."
5,NKOTB,"This item was the best CD!!! I do not understand why this did not sell as well a previous albums because this is FANTASTIC! Every track was wonderful and shouldn't songs be judged by the tempo, melody and beat, anyway?Track number 5 is the BEST!! if you go away has always been my favorite and always will.If you should happen to pass this CD someday, be sure to listen to track 5 and 7."
5,Artemisia will become part of you,"Artemisia Gentileschi was an Italian Early Baroque painter, today considered one of the most accomplished painters in the generation influenced by Caravaggio. In an era when women painters were not easily accepted by the artistic community, she was the first female painter. This book is a research in Artemisia's life and though it is a little bit fictioned it does leave a footprint in your heart that few other books do. It describes the life in Italy of a woman in those ages, the struggle of an artist and a genius, the difficult relationship that often men have with their daughters from the dawn of time. Artemisia and her story will touch you deeply in your creativity and in your admiration for the women that did make the difference for many of us in History."
4,DFM review,"We've purchased this book as part of an information package that we give to children who are newly diagnosed. Some of the issues are clearly outdated (for example, the child with DM having to eat the cake without icing whereas now we know that, using carbohydrate counting, this is not necessarily the case). There are positive aspects to the book-reinforcement that there are ""special things"" that you have to do to stay healthy-blood glucose checks, insulin injections etc... but above all, ""you're (still)a regular kid."" The book also touches on parental grief/anger at the disease, sibling jealousy, a child's perspective that diabetes means you'll ""die"" because of the first syllable of the word, ""diabetes."" In the eyes of our office staff, the positive aspects of this book outweigh the negative or ""outdated"" material.Maybe a revised edition or sequel could have info on the insulin pump!"
4,Even Little Kids Get Diabetes,"This is a very nice book for smaller children. I enjoyed reading this to my 2 year old. There are a few things that have changed since it was published in 1991. Children can now have some candy, ice cream and cake on special occasions and if it's sugar free or low on carbs. But overall this book was a nice way to introduce my child to the understanding that he is not alone and that there are other children who get diabetes."
4,Save your Chair seat,These pads work great for light incontinence and fit well on a dining room chair or a recliner. I would not suggest them for a bed as they are too small to help. They were great in regular chairs.
3,Pretty cool. Didn't think it was that invilved,Well. I'm an MBA student and always thought restaurants were kid's stuff. After reading this book I realized what goes into into. I learned alot and recommend this for everyone.
5,A very good book,"I love to cook and I love to read--this book is extremely well written and gives a very accurate portrayal of life in the kitchen (professionally). A ""regular"" person could enjoy reading this too--it isn't just for chefs or chefs-to-be. There are some very hilarious sections in here--I just loved it!"
1,Didn't Meet Up,"After purchasing this Cd, I was less than impressed with the whole thing, all the way through. Ann's voice just doesn't have the umpth to really stand out and be ""original"" as everyone is saying about her. A majority of the songs have the same dance beat, which becomes very annoying around the third or fourth track. All the tracks are all very similar and her high waif like voice doesn't capture my attention. There's absolutely no soul to this CD. 2 times isn't even that good of a start out single."
5,Great,"Is a Original motofcraft product and works perfect, have a escort 97 and is great, the old one was not working good anymore"
1,Fake,"I was really disappointed when my phaser arrived and, when I tried to stun my teacher with it, nothing happened. This phaser is fake, and doesn't function properly, but Amazon won't give me a refund. Severely disappointed."
2,"""BLOODLUST"" Is Subpar Power Metal","Sacred Steel is a German power metal band and ""BLOODLUST"" is their offering for the year 2000. I have not heard any other albums by this band so I cannot comment on their overall output, but if this particular album is any indication of the bulk of their work, then I have just purchased my first and last Sacred Steel album. The band may very well be a talented group of musicians, but this disc certainly doesn't show it off nearly as frequently as it should. A couple slightly memorable hooks and riffs here and there do almost nothing for the overall product and ""BLOODLUST"" pretty much just sits there and sounds subpar and amateurishly generic. Yes there are songs like ""Stormhammer"" and ""Master Of Thy Fate"" that have decent choruses and slightly catchy melodies, but the album is not nearly as good nor as memorable as say a Hammerfall or Nocturnal Rites disc. ""BLOODLUST"" may not be the worst of its kind, but it certainly could be better!"
1,What a waste of money!,"This is my first review on Amazon. Outrage and disappointment about the content of this book has driven me to. I was mislead by the many good reviews here when I purchased the audiobook. I have read and listened to a lot of self-improvement books, good ones and bad ones, but this one is by far the worst. It has no content whatsoever! Just have some one tell you ""best"" and ""optimal"" 20 times in one minute to you and you get what the audiobook offers. In addition to that the delivery of the audiobook is terrible! The author has a monotone and terrible voice and makes you want to turn off after 2 minutes.I have no idea how this book got so many 5 star reviews. Did I purchase the same book?Do NOT waste your money on this book!"
5,As good as the Harry Potter series all over again,"It make be called a children's book but it is a teenager-young adult book because not everthing happens how you expect it to like in the Harry Potter. I loved reading it! I always moaned when class was over because i had to stop reading it. But it is about a brother and sister who have just been sent to live with there uncle on the ship the ""Expediant"". Well on the ship they find out about a secret organzation called the Hourable Guild of Specialists (which there parents and uncle are voluntered in). And this starts an adventure to find an ancient tecnolgy."
2,Fair but not as advertised,"I received a US Mail advertisment for this book. I thought it looked interesting but didn't want to spend the approx. $30 to buy it outright. Very glad I got it used at Amazon. Not as advertised.A lot of mainline medical information. Not much that seemed ""Folk Remedy"" to me. Not recommended."
2,The Folk Remedy Encyclopedia,The book was in poor condition not good condition as stated. It was water damaged. The pages are readable but difficult to turn!
1,"the folk remedy encyclopedia:olive oil, vinegar, honey and 1001 other remedies by FC&A medical publishing","Terrible shape, the book is crooked and the front cover is coming off. Linda"
4,Get It Cheaper,"When choosing one look for a ""raised"" ""v"". I've found Revlon's ""v"" is too flat. You can get a good trimmer at WalMart for $.87."
3,Not as good as first one but better then most of the recent westerns. I say C+,"""The difference is justice, you'll know it when you feel it squeezing around your neck."" Judge John Goodnight (Perry) rides into a town to dispense his own brand of justice. When the town is attacked Goodnight captures a young bandit who turns out to be the the son of a local woman. When Goodnight uses the boy to find the head of the gang more secrets are revealed. After watching the first movie and actually thinking it wasn't that cheesy I went in expecting the same from this one. I was wrong. I realize that this one was also on the Hallmark Channel and I should have expected it but this was way cheesier then the first movie. The main plot and reveal actually made me hang my head and shake it at the ridiculousness of it. I will say though that when compared to the newer westerns that have come out this is still better then most. Which is kinda sad. Overall, not as good as first one but watchable. I give it a C+."
3,ehhhh,"The game was pretty cool, really. Theres a couple of things that dissapointed me though. Like really, all you need is a really strong card to win. If you get a Meteor Black Dragon (ATK: 3500 (DEF: 2500), you basically win, thers not much that can beat that card. Then if you add Mountain to that, your unstoppable. You could be Obalisk the Tourmentor if you wanted if you added a dragon treasure to that. And theres no really stratigie to it. Its not like the show at all. And theres too many cards with 999,999. Who the hell is gonna play that long just to get that many star chips. That would take forever. So if you really want strong cards, just use game shark and use the all cards cheat. Soo much easier. Too bad I found that out after I beat it."
5,It's a great game,"Firts i'm sorry for any mistake in this text, because i'm from Venezuela, and i know a little english, well this game is great and it's very funny."
3,ICE Complete Collection,It was fairly entertaining. It started out a little slow but once you get pass the first part it a little more exciting.
2,label patches everywhere,"in the picture it shows the jacket plain black with orange inside. when i got it it patches all over it saying the name brand, that were velcro so when i pulled them off i had velcro patches all over the outside of the jacket. i had to take it to a seamstress to have them removed. the kind of material would have been easy to damage if i had tried to remove them myself. i was very disapointed and will never order from them again."
2,enough Junie B. Jones,"I have read all of the Junie B. Jones books, both to my own children and to the children who visit my library. After 25 HILARIOUS books, Junie B. Jones' antics in Aloha-ha-ha are no longer funny---just plain annoying! Maybe 25 books would have been a good stopping point."
1,worst online purchase ever,"Warmish lather leaks all over my bathroom sink from the back of the ""hot lather machine"". It is very easy to use, but far more disappointing to use. The lather gets only a little warm at best, even on the highest setting. The piece which conects to the shaving gel can makes a poor seal and the gel leaks wasting more on the sink than on my face. The only thing that was a bigger waste was the amount of money I spent on this product!"
3,Free SF Reader,"The planetary Terran government at the time is oppressive and insular. This did not stop a few intrepid types risking the dangers and getting into space.When they explore the planet of the Astra, they find resistance, but eventually make a deal with the local aliens, and go exploring with them.They find people they didn't expect."
4,One of the better tributes,"I was only a casual BR fan when I saw this on Amazon.com and bought it at the local record store. After listening to it once, I was a devout Bad Religion fanatic. It's that good.To tell the truth, it's the selection that rocks, and a lot of the covers are really good. Here are the ones that I think are good:The Line ""Along The Way""Jeffries Fan Club ""Suffer""Mind Driver ""Generator""The Jeff Tucker Extravaganza ""I Want To Conquer The World""The Quadratics ""Pessimistic Lines""Pushover ""Struck A Nerve""Brotherhood Of Death ""Billy""Los Villains ""Atomic Garden/What Can You Do?/White Trash (Second Generation)""Cheater ""Faith Alone""Bullet Treatment ""Part III/Damned To Be Free""I excluded One Hit Wonder ""Two Babies In The Dark"" because it isn't just 'good', it is EXCELLENT. All in all, I would say buy this CD if you listen to BR or not."
5,Just what we needed,"We are a family of 3 with a dog and just went away for a week. We had a lot of stuff to bring and fit into our SUV. That being said, we have a small condo and dont have a lot of space to store a hard car top storage unit. This bag was the perfect answer. Held lots of our stuff, everything stayed safe and it folds up into a small box. Love it!"
2,Disappointed,This is a very comfortable bra but it is poorly made and not at all worth the price. The elastic in the first bra started to fray and tear within a couple of weeks so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement bra has held up marginally better but the elastic still isn't very good. I've had other Donna Karan bras for years but this particular model is not up to their standards.
2,Staples bend and don't go in,"Usually Swingline/Arrow makes a good product, but these staples are not it. For every 10 I try to put in, I need to pull the crumpled bodies of 6 of them. This was not happening with the staples I used prior to the Arrow ones."
5,Amazing Guide,This lets you see the ins and outs of Disney. It lets you look at Disney in a different way. It's just fun and it's great. So it's great fun!!!!!
5,So Much Fun!!,My daughter was doing the Disney College Program this past semester and we gave her the book about 1.5 months before she was coming home and that rejuvenated her visits to the Parks on her days off. She was passionate about finding the answers to the clues and tried her hardest not to run over the 3-yr olds that were in her way. :) We heard about her Treasure Hunting adventures regularly and had a great time learning which clues were still there and how hard it was to find some. She also had to ride some attractions multiple times to find all the clues. We visited her over Thanksgiving and the entire family got involved in Treasure Hunting!! Great fun!
2,This item does not fit!!,"I bought this car seat, and it constantly is comming off in the back. Never stays in place at all. Very durable material though."
1,Broke after one flight,"This cheaply made and assembled chopper ( I have three other choppers from a different company that are great, BTW) took more time than necessary to setup because of faulty threading on the battery door on the RC. Once it was finally ready for flight, I flew it once then the gear teeth wore away. Literally on the first flight the gears stopped gripping the rotor spinner.I would never buy from this company again."
5,The Icon,A slick edition of the book that brought these ideas to the English speaking world. To date the authors have still done some of the best objective research in this field. Check this book out:The Sacred Spring of the Blood Royal: The Secret Order of the GrailI just read it. Its a new novel based on these themes.
5,SICK AS YOU KNOW WHAT,MESS ALWAYS COMES WIT HEAT HES ONE OF OUR BAY AREAS FINEST ONE OF HIS BEST CDS COPE IT AND YOU WILL SAY THE SAME
5,necessity,if you have an ipod this is the best additional purchase you can make. My Ipod is 3 years old now and does not have a scratch on it. this case fits like a glove and has held up through being dropped multiple times. For 20 dollars you can insure that your ipod will be safe! well worth it.
5,INSTRUMENTAL SURF AS IT'S BEST!!!,"Slacktone in my opion and countless others that I speak with about surf instrumental music all agree that ""Slacktone"" is Tops in their genre. Go to Live365.com and then search ""surf"". Go to Devlar Surf Sessions for continuous Instrumental Surf 24/7. They play all of Slacktone's fine music."
4,A very funny book about an ordinary boy.,"The book is comprised of a collection of vignette-like stories that progress over time, as opposed to one main storyline. It is reassuring to find that Peter has the same problems as any older sibling. His little brother ""Fudge"" is adorable, but no one else seems to see how much trouble he causes. This is a good choice for anyone with a toddler in the family. Readers should not expect the usual laid out plot, but rather a sequence of memorable events."
3,A fun and easy to read book,"I loved this book because the author described the scenes so good! I loved the part when Fudge had his birthday and wrecked the house! Fudge and his friends walked on the furniture, destroyed the cake and trashed the house! I loved this part because they made it so interesting and fun!. Fudge and his friends are a real mischief, Fudge`s mother is really mad at him but Fudge doesn't get in trouble since he is a little kid. I also liked the part when Peter and his friends do their project . They do all different types of transportation like: trucks, monorails and planes. They described how they colored and decorated all the different types of transportation they made for their project. I didn't like the part when Fudge swallowed Dribble because first of all Fudge wasn't supposed to touch Peter's things . Fudge had to go to the hospital to get Dribble out of his stomach with caster oil.I really recommend this fun, crazy book!"
4,Funny and perfect for kids,"This book is perfect for ages 8-11. I teach 4th graders and used it as a class novel, The kids could really relate to the main character! His brother Fudge is always into trouble and in his things! This book flows nicely!"
4,Daughters book,This purchas was for my daughters electronic reading device. We downloaded this material with no issues and she has enjoyed reading this material.
4,Tales of a 4th Grade Nothing,"Fudge is a great character. Reading about him always makes me laugh every time. It is a book that is just perfect to share with a group, especially when there are other kids that do not like to read."
4,very pleased with my purchase,My experience was good. The book came with in the time allowed and was in good condition as promised.
5,"A fun, easy book for kids that just doesn't get too deep","This is a good book for kids to read because it's light, fun, easy, and interesting. Judy Blume does a good job of developing her characters. The storyline is interesting and appropriate for children. The book explores what children do, think, and feel. The main character in the story, Peter, is one of my favorite kids from children's lit, right up there with James Henry Trotter from James and the Giant Peach.This is another one of those books that you don't have to read before you die, but still, it'd be a shame to miss."
3,Haley,I liked the story because it's funny! If I was you I would read it. Tell other people about it too!
1,Didn't like the reading style,"This review is just on the audio presentation. I really liked the book, so I decided to try the audio book. Since it's narrated by the author, I though this would be a great way to hear the story from the author's perspective. I couldn't finish the book. She used a ""cute"" voice. It got annoying. I felt like I was being spoken down to. Condescended. While I am an adult, do children really like being spoken to like that?"
4,The Fantastic Book,I liked the book.It was a funny story to me.I can relate to all the characters in the book. I think the characters were belivable.I think other kids would enjoy reading this book.My favorite part of the story is when Peter gets his dog.I liked the way the story ended because Peter got what he wanted which was a dog.Those are the reasons I enjoyed this book.
3,Good with modifications,"I like the case very much! But when I got it, not so much. The thing is, with the design, you push in the left side to open it, that pushes the pegs in and releases them from the slot. But once you put your palm in, there's no room to push the side in anymore, so you're kind of stuck for taking it back out (if you close the cover it's incredibly hard to get it open again). HOWEVER! if you carefully sand off the pegs with a bit of sandpaper or a nailfile, then it no longer gets stuck and you can use it normally and as described. I like it this way! :)By the way, their screen protector is really good, it's very thin and comes with a protective sheet on both sides that you pull off to apply, I may have to order some separately. :)"
5,River Notes,"I am a big fan of the old slim version of River Notes. It has such a beautiful flow, like rivers. I have lived all my life near rivers. My soul belongs to them. I am so greatful for this writing. Lopez takes you down this path that borders on lunacy, but having spent plenty of alone time on rivers, working out the various troubles of life as I roamed, I understand this perfectly. Not a book for the faint-hearted, I've found out. I have given copies to several friends who didn't understand it. But when I do visit with someone who understands Lopez, I know I'm onto something."
3,"Good, readable period mystery","This was my second Matthew Bartholomew mystery. I found it rather formulaic to the first... the details coming at you with nothing going anywhere until they all physically spy on a meeting in a church. There is very little interesting in his teaching, the details of his profession are quite interesting to read about. But overall the plot was a little shallow to me personally in depth and character development. And where was his betrothed? The main protagonist doesn't have much feeling IMHO."
1,Overly used plot,"It's the typical story of the unpopular girl and popular new guy falling in love, then the unpopular girls popular best friend gets jealous and it ends their friendship.Only difference, there's a little bit of magick thrown in.But unfortunately, even that plot is overly used.Morgan (the unpopular girl) finds out that she's a ""blood witch"" (Meaning she's descended from witches) and she was adopted. Cal (The popular new guy) is also a blood witch and his Mother is a high priestess.The writer has talent though, I'll give her that. But she needs to come up with an original plot.If you really want some good and original books, try Isobel Bird's series ""Circle Of Three"", or L.J. Smith's series ""The Secret Circle"""
5,Good fun,"Okay, so what happens to the heroine is a bit beyond the ""practical"" ...this is an excellent series of fiction. I bought these books for my teenage son and neice, but ended up reading them myself as well. It is fun and easy reading while at the same time explaining some of the more basic concepts to young people in an entertaining way, as well as fueling their curiousity for more learning. And hey, even an old lady like me enjoyed it for the light reading! Though you have to start with book 1 and go through the series in order or you won't understand what's going on."
