5,Amazing,"Best garlic press I've ever seen, used, or touched. Researched multiple sites and they all said the same thing: this is the best out there. I've confirmed. Enough said."
5,"Thank you, ATK","I heard about this garlic press on America's Test Kitchen -- a trusted source of information. I love that the press is stainless steel so it will last forever, never rust and never transfer anything unwanted to the food with which it comes in contact. The swing-out mechanism is easy to clean thoroughly -- just as advertised."
1,This is ridiculous,"I can only reiterate the issues raised by other reviewers. Those who are looking for the print quality that Epson is known for are often professionals in graphic design, photography and other digital arts. Macintosh computers are the gold standard in this area. This marketing faux pas ignores professionals' needs and, when all is said and done, is limiting Epson sales."
3,I Expect Much More From These Musicians!!,"John ""JoJo"" Hermann of Widespread Panic fame, has come up short in his first effort at a solo career. This was something he has been waiting a long time to do, and I feel that this disc just does not meet the standard that is possible from a man of his talent. He has a great supporting cast behind him, with the Dickinson bro's of the North Mississippi All-Stars.This disc is worth the money but I think after a while of listening you can hear what I mean. Maybe without the skills of Widespread Panic, JoJo can not carry a band on his own. Hopefully there will be 2nd solo effort with more effort put into the final product."
2,Disconcerting and unsettling,The ending to this book was very disappointing to me because it diminished greatly the potential message of the story. It was as if it left you hanging. I felt it only reinforced current inaccurate views in our culture about mental illness.
2,The Novelist,The story line was very disappointing and left me with a weird feeling. I would not recommend this book to anyoneI love her writing in some of her books and most of the ones I have read leave me with a good experience..
3,Just OK,"I bought this stockpot last year. I have a huge collection of Le Creuset pans and I love them all. This stockpot, however, didn't perform nearly as well as all the others. I use it mainly to make big pots of soup which I then freeze in small containers as ""emergency"" meals. And I noticed that there is some ""crazing"" of the enamel inside the bottom of the pot. I rarely use the pot on high heat, but, that's what stockpots are for...making stock!Anyway, I'm disappointed that this pot did not work as well as all my others. And, the other pots I have in my collection include the wok (which is fantastic), 2 grill pans (terrific) and many sized Dutch Ovens (love them). I will continue to use this stockpot but I have a stainless steel one that works just as well. I'll stick to stainless in this area from now on."
2,Made in Thailand,"Just purchased this item in white. Was so excited about buying what I thought was a French made stock pot that I didn't think to check where it was actually made. I tipped the box over and saw that it was made in Thailand.After finding this out and reading some of the negative reviews, I will be returning this not-so-French stock pot."
5,DJ Magazine,"Over the years the name Guidance has become synonymous with sexy deep house music. More recently they've made some very positive moves in to hip hop territory, but it's house that's made them what they are today. The 'Hi Fidelity' series is testament to this quality and with the likes of Jazzanova, King Britt, Wamdue Music, Kevin Yost and Dubtribe all contributing exclusive tracks to this volume it's easy to see why it's so good. The vibes are spacious and groovy, the cuts ranging from straight-up house to jazz-tinged downtempo beakers. Great listening for mature heads."
4,Classic Lindley,"Although not quite as good as El Rayo X from 1981, this is still agreat CD. It is David Lindley at his classic best; catchy songs with wonderfulinstrumentation. Dave's later work goes more full bore into world music withexotic instruments of which he is a master, but for me these first 2 albums(El Rayo X and Very Greasy) are still my favorites."
5,Timeless comedian,Bought this as a gift for my nephew. He has enjoyed quite a few hours in the company of these films. He is VERY pleased.Recomeds. The tin box is very nice as well.
2,Item returned,Appealing design but the sizing is misleading. The item was returned because they were too small; I could not simply exchange it as the vendor requires one to return and re-purchase.
4,Thought provoking and solid,A collection of papers from the Boston Consulting Group from the past four years. They have not dated which is nice.Occasionally reads a little like a BCG presentation so can be a bit dry - but the CONTENT is great.Has chapters of related material ie. REAL brand management for the 21st century; dealing with e-commerce effectively and strategically without wasting money.Nice big picture stuff but with meat - you could actually use the material to kick start some thinking in your company.Good stuff!
5,Nice,"Nice shelf, just the right size and height, beautiful material. Easy to assemble, took only a couple of minutes. Will buy another in the future."
5,looking out for #1,"This is a really great book to get a different realistic viewpoint on my different everyday events. I have read this book 3 times. First when I was 23 years old, and my husband recommended it to me. It was hard to comprehend, but I read it again when I was 30 years old and totally understood it. Loved it and refer to it many times. When my husband passed away in 2005, I felt my life was off kilter and needed to find center, so I picked up this book again. This was the best thing I could have done. I love his writings, and laugh though out this book. Looking out for #1 is a vantastic book to read, but if you do not understand the point he is trying to make, read it again, and ponder on it. Open your eyes and your mind, then decide for your self what YOU want to believe. His point of view or the one that society tell us what we should believe. I have recommended this book to soo many friends."
5,want to remember the magic of being a child?,"Remember when everything was magical to you? Come on I know if you really tried you could. Yes that's right all the years ago when you were a kid. Want to remember what it was like? If you do then I suggest you let Robert McCammon take you on a little trip in what I feel is without question the best book he has written and one of the best books I have ever read. Classic is truly the way to describe this piece. I won't go indepth to the story itself, but the book follows the story of Cory Mackenson a young boy (11yrs old)in 1964 and his adventures in Zephyr Alabama, a magical town. I know that one line doesn't sound too thrilling, but this truly is a story that has to be experienced. I've recommended it to numerous friends and I have yet to have a single person tell me that they weren't touched in some way by this book."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","I bought this book after seeing it's 5-starred review and was very excited to read it. However, as I delved deeper and deeper into the book, I found myself wondering when it was going to get interesting. An excellent writer though McCammon may be, the plot was not interesting to me. This may be because I usually prefer sci-fi and horror novels to strait fiction/literature novels. I HAVE read King's ""The Body"" and ""The Stand"", as well as The Girl With ""The Dragon Tattoo"" and ""The Gargoyle"" (both are excellent fiction/literature novels, especially the latter) all four of which take a while to get going, but are somehow completely absorbing.BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking forward to the story of a young boy and a mildy interesting murder mystery, I'd recommend this book. But if, like me, you were searching for something with a supernatural element and/or excitement, I'd advise you to look elsewhere."
5,Thank you Mr. McCammon,"My mother gave me this book saying, ""This may be the best book I've ever read."" Having read it, I gave it to my wife saying, "" This may be the best book I've ever read."" Since then, we have given away many copies of this work saying the same thing again and again. No one has been disappointed. Thank you Mr. McCammon."
5,I give a copy to everyone I care about . . .,"Boy's Life is the type of book that, at any time or any place, can pull a person out of their life and make them young. The front cover says ""Recapture the Magic"" and I can't think of a more appropriate catch-line. At 21, closer to birth than death, hopefully, and having just begun to encounter the way real life pounds away and yanks away our simple loves, I think that we all need books like ""Boy's Life"" to help us keep that love simple. I give a copy to friends on any fitting occasion. I'd give one to you if i knew you . . ."
5,Cooking with Lard,"Excellent Country Cookbook, If you ever used Lard this is one that will bring back memories. Everything is so true. The only way to grow up. Can picture myself, carrying water to Clean the hogs when I was little. And the reciepts are excellent, Can remember mama cooking just like that."
4,Kill 'Em All,"Kill 'Em All being Metallica's 1983 release and their debut album is thrash metal and speed metal at its finest. Here we get well-written lyrics, amazing guitar riffs and intensity and anger in the singing. The booklet is quite simple with all the lyrics and a photograph of the band on the back of the booklet. The critics loved the album when it was released and Allmusic gave it 5/5. I think it is a great release but 4/5 is a more fair assessment. 4/5."
2,horrible remaster,"this gets 3 stars because the music is great but the sound is terrible and they took the 2 extra songs ""blitzkrieg"" and ""am i evil?"" off this version. PLEASE! why remaster such a classic album that sounded great to begin with? Black Sabbath waited till the 90's to remaster their recordings from the 70's why did they have to butcher this one so soon?"
3,Boring; but not to bad.,"I was all hyped when I got this CD because I thought it would really interesting to listen to, being Metallica's first album. And guess what... I was right, for a little while because I ended up finding most of the songs rather boring. Metallica hadn't discovered their talent to be epic, and when they did in Ride The Lightning their music improved as a result. Anyway, Jump In The Fire is a coooooool classic and is just about the best song on the album along with The Four Horsemen. Whiplash is also good and Hit The Lights.Goodbye"
3,"Good, but NOT Metallica's best","""Kill 'em All""--the Met's debut. And not a bad one!!! I am a big Metallica fan, and despite the fact that I love ""Kill 'em All"", I would place it at the very bottom of my favorite Metallica albums list. Yes, even under ""Load"" and ""Reload"", which are GREAT albums that need to be given more credit. The only song I'd say I really respect on this album is ""Anesthesia"", Cliff's legendary solo. The other songs are enjoyable, but they're a little too ""fun metal-ish"" for me. The way I see it, ""Kill 'em All"" was an album that was dedicated to hard-core party animals and metal-heads, but never-the-less, a must-own. It's probably best to buy this album after you buy all the others."
5,Where it all began,"This album signaled the greatness that would be Metallica during the 1980s. If you like metal, then this album is a must. Classics such as Seek and Destroy, Four Horsemen and No Remorse truly make this album one of the greats. Although it isn't as good as Ride, Justice and Master, it still ranks up there with many metal albums. Anybody who says that whitesnake and scorpions are real metal while this isn't doesnt know what he's talking about. Anything that Metallica released in the 80's is surely the best that the metal genre can offer. Iron Maiden and Megadeth should also be looked into"
5,One of the best Metallica albums,"along with master of puppets and ride the lightning, its one of the best albums. The best songs here areThe Four HorsemenSeek and DestroyBoth exceptional songs"
3,My least favorite Metallica album!,"many say this was the beginning of thrash metal. I agree whole heartedly but i think this was not a great start for Metallica. The real start of Metallica was Ride the Lightning, when compared to this album is the best album of the 80s along with The Clash's ""London Calling"". Two different styles of music but those are my two favorite 80s albums along with And Justice For All from Metallica..."
3,"Good, But Not KING DIAMOND or EXODUS","Personally, I lean more towards Exodus and King Diamond. (Possibly the 2 most grossly underrated groups there are. And while I'm on it, Hank Shermann and Andy La Rocque have to be the most grossly underrated guitarists there are. 2nd only to Yngwie Malmsteen.) Well, that said this is fairly good record. (Though I think the much less recognized Exodus' 'Bonded By Blood' is much better. Well, the subject at hand, ""Kill Em All"" is not as refined as their later ""Ride ther Lightnig,"" but it has good power and a good consistency throughout. From 'Hit the Lights' to 'Metal Militia' the record is never boring. Also, even though the lyrics are hard to make out at times, the music carries the tracks quite well. The bass solo was a nice touch. It's too bad that 2 tracks from the original recording were removed. If you buy this record and like it, be sure to get their masterpiece ""Ride the Lightning."" Also check out 'Bonded By blood' by EXODUS."
4,"good first album, jump on and try not to get metal up your A","A very good first album. It definitely shows the potential of these guys as being metal gods. It was very rough, yet full of energy. It led to more polished and better albums, but this one is great. if you can, try to find the re-release with Am I evil??"
5,Essential Metallica,"If you like Thrash Metal, you need this album. No metal collection is complete without Metallica, and this is a great representation of the band's core vibe before they changed their sound. When I first got this album over a decade ago, I put it aside and liked other Metallica albums much better, like Ride the Lightning,...And Justice For All, Master of Puppets, and the black album. KEA was a little too rough around the edges for me then. But I have seen the light. This album is back in the rotation for me. If you like Heavy Metal, especially if you like Thrash, give this album a try. If you like Metallica, this album is an essential part of your collection."
1,recycled pap,"Oh, another story of a whore with a heart of gold. Yawn! Yes, Nell, you were the protestant whore, that's great, just stir up more religious tensions.Hell, even King Charles grew bored with her, for a good reason, too. Shouldn't we get to read stories about interesting women who actually did something with their lives?"
5,"Biography, photos & designs!","This biography is rich and detailed. For anyone who has enjoyed the artistic works of William Morris and want to know more about his life and influences on his life's writings, and sense of design and talent. It is not a complete summary of his artistic output but you get a good dose of the different kinds of art & design that he's famous for."
4,Satisfaction,"Prompt service; quick delivery. So, once more, a very satisfied customer of Amazon.In fact I have already finished reading this superbly documented and generouslyillustrated biography by the talented Fiona MacCarthy. I am quite a fan of her biographies.I am a committed Pre-Raphaelite junkie, preferring to lose myself in this wonderfulVictorian art world. I have by now quite a library of books on the Pre-Raphaelites largelypurchased from Amazon both in the U K and the U S A, all arriving without fail in far offAustralia within the delivery time promised."
4,"Good Writing, way too short","I got interested in this after hearing the radio adaption on Sirius/XM radio. While the radio adaption was adequate and geared for an 1940's audience, the original story is darker and more serious. I like this book, although I feel that Mr. London could have expanded more on life after the plague dissapated - how mankind de-evolved into primitive societies, the civilization that they know with all of it's technological advances disappearing and if there was hope for them. I do recommend this book as a jumping off point if you are into that type of fiction."
4,Catchy groove,"This is a good dance groove with a catchy, while relatively monotonous theme (which of course is typical for this genre of music) Nevertheless, I find it very appealing. I would rate it as top 100, perhaps top 40 dance chart material, it stands out among much of the techno stuff I've been listening to lately. Good rave stuff."
4,"Bugs, dogs, and frogs","Young, naive Suzanne adventured through World War Two as a British civilian employee of a wild and wacked-out American Army news service in Algiers and Italy. She defended herself from amorous attempts on her virginity with the classic Victorian hatpin before meeting the -- well, I'm not quite up to that part yet, but I imagine he's a nice guy -- man she was to marry.As a child, she lived with one or both of her supremely odd parents and an even weirder nanny in the idyllic south of France and the Malaysian jungle, fearlessly encountering bugs, dogs, frogs, and more. At the copyright date of 2000, she'd have been 79 or so, but her book is easy and fun to read.Blessedly, this intriguing biography is well-designed, correctly punctuated, and free of typos -- unusual these days. The photos are okay, too, and what a head of hair she had!"
1,Not Interesting,"This is a poorly written, self-important excuse for a whodunit. I thought I would be interested since I'm a church musician, but really, there is nothing redeeming in this."
4,Bloody Fun!,"This was a lot gorier than previous Forgotten Realms novels I had read. That said, I enjoyed it. I felt that it would have made an excellent Ravenloft story. For those who enjoy visceral and bloody combat sequences, I would recommend this book."
2,Not one of the better FR books to date...,"I found this book to be lacking in numerous areas. Primarily, it seemed hard to follow and somewhat irrelevant to the Harper series. The main character, although she had a lot of depth, didn't stike me as very interesting and most of the supporting characters met untimely ends too frequently thoughout the story, making it more like a bad horror movie. The writing style was okay. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,SIMPLY GREAT !!!!,"That's pure rock with pure rythms. plenty of energy is given thru all songs. if you like strong and straigh notes, you'll love it."
1,buy something else,"this thing skips...badly. even if you're sitting still, the thing skips when you least except it even after it's played the cd correctly several times through before."
4,It's pretty good,"This camera is pretty good but you'll need to read the manual to really get what you want from it. The on screen menus can be a little confusing. Also, be prepared to buy stock in Energizer because it goes through batteries really quickly. The software bundle that came with it was pretty nice. There is a panorama making program and photo impression 2000 editing software. Downloading pictures into my computer is way too easy. I haven't printed any yet, but they look really good as wallpaper or e-mail attatchments. I wish it were a little smaller, although I wouldn't expect to get anything better for the money I spent. It looks modern, it's not to big or heavy to carry around and once you know what the buttons do it's pretty easy to use. If it didn't go through so many batteries it would have been a five star review."
1,no no no get a traditional cast iron,"I love my traditional cast iron skillet and got this for my husbands sake, since he had difficulty with the care of cast iron. I thought this would be the best of both world. Benefit of cast iron heating and the ability for my husband to wash it with soap and not be concerned with oxidation. However, this pan majorly sticks. Have tried using sprays and oils, but even still the pan sticks. I would definitely not recommend le creuset skillets. I would recommend a traditional cast iron skillet or if you really don't want to deal with the care of cast iron get one of the newer non-sticks that have apparently less toxic coatings than those of the past."
4,Skillet,"Love the skillet but things seem to stick and I have made sure that I fully understood the directions before I used it and I have never put it in the dishwasher. I have a 6"" omelet pan that I have had from LeCreuset for years and it doesn't stick. Any suggestions would be welcome - I am careful to have butter or oil in the bottom as carefully watch the heat on the stove - I have a ceramic top stove. Thanks for any help you can give."
2,Very disappointed,I purchased this pan about a year ago and I'm very disappointed with its performance. As soon as it arrived I read the instructions and was surprised to learn I should not cook with it at high temperatures. I followed the instructions at all times. I've successfully seasoned standard cast iron cookware in the past but had no success with this pan. Just about everything I cook sticks.
4,Impressive Debut,"Tracy Chapman's debut album contains three all-out, undeniable classic songs - ""Fast Car"", ""Talkin' Bout a Revolution"", and ""Baby Can I Hold You,"" the latter being one of the most subtle, beautiful songs I've ever heard. The rest of the album is also quite enjoyable and is arguably the album that brought about the serious attitude that developed towards female singer/songwriters in the 90s. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Peter Gabriel, Crowded House, Sarah MacLachlan, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, or other artists that deliver heartfelt, honest songs that also happen to be catchy."
3,Great Voice,"I love her voice and songs. They have a blues quality to them that you don't often hear anymore. I actually bought this CD by accident. The one I really like is her first one, ""New Beginnings""."
5,Love them!,"These glasses are wonderful! Everyone loves the slight green hue. They are also sturdy, so far in the 6 months I've had them NO issues in the dishwasher! I would recommend them to anyone. :)"
2,Disappointing,"Why didn't UFO ever make it big in this country? After hearing this recording I know. A really great band with great songs that just sound flat. They play all the hits from the Michael Shenker era albums, but Paul Chapman sounds like he's just learning the songs. Mediocre recording quality. If you want a cool UFO album you haven't heard, try The Early Years collection."
4,The Cars at their not very best,"This is the first and most recent studio album for the Cars since the release of THE CARS' GREATEST HITS in 1985. The songs are very good in this album. YOU ARE THE GIRL,STRAP ME IN and COMING UP YOU are wonderful. Since the release of GREATEST HITS,the late Ben Orr released a solo album and Ric Ocasek released THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. For their own reasons,the Cars decided to disband after recording DOOR TO DOOR."
5,Epson Premium Lustre Photo Paper,"This is a fantastic product. I use it to print pictures with a professional look. It is a matte finish paper and the finished product looks so much better on this paper than any other photo paper. I print at home, and it is virtually impossible to distinguish the photos I have printed on this paper from professional processing. I highly recommend this product."
5,A god product at a good price,"Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper produces great results on a variety of printers. I do try to match the photo papeer with the printer, but I have found Epson Ultra Premium which is fantastic on my Epson printer, works equally well on HP, Kodak and other printers. Ordering from Amazon was, as always, simple; the delivery was within 7 days and arrived undamaged. No complaints -- As long as Amazon continues to carry what I need, has the best total price and good service, I will keep shopping here."
3,"protects screen, no real glare reduction","As I said, this protects the screen, but there's no real glare reduction as I'd hoped for. fit my hp pavilion dv6 very well. pain to put on, DEFINITELY need TWO people."
3,Epson Ultra Premiums Photo Paper Luster,"The package came in very bad shape -- it looked very beat up. I almost returned it without opening it. However, when I did open the package, the paper was in excellent shape. Yes, I would buy this product again."
4,Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster,I was very pleased with the prints produced on Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster. The only thing preventing me from giving it a 5 star rating is the fact that the back has a slick coating requiring a photo pen if you wish to write anything. It also has Epson printed on the back of the paper and I prefer a plain back.
2,dsl,"this paper was recommended to me to use on my new epson printer, i wasn't extremely impressed with the product results had better results from a different vender."
4,"Astounding, coming from Waite",This is one of the better works of the author. A really in-depth study of the subject.
3,Her beginnings....,"You can see the author finding her voice in this one. It's jumpy with moments of sparking fire that characterize her later works. She dips a toe into the magic realism and fairy tale, and seeing these tentative steps should give all writers faith that they should pursue their weirdest ideas, mediated by the story.I recommend reading this not first but after you've seen her at her best, as in The Passion."
4,Very different but very interesting and quite good,"This book was part of an extracurricular reading assignment for a college-related book club led by an English prof. Regardless of the opinions of the 20 participants when they entered the class, when the 90 minute class ended, the majority agreed they liked it and found it quirky but quite good. I would recommend it for the experienced reader and I DO plan to read other works by the same author."
2,Oranges are not the only fruit,"Good, interesting beginning, but the rest of the book is rubbish. no point in the whole story - what do oranges have to do with the whole sorry tale?"
4,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic book, and I really like the fairytale aspect of it... I just wish the ending wasn't so abrupt."
5,5 out of 5!,"I knew as soon as I saw this product that I wanted it. If you are going for looks and want to save $5,000 by NOT buying Brembo pads, this is what you need. For me this was a 2 hour project and I had fun doing it. I recommend removing all wheels, cleaning all pads, and taping BEFORE you start painting. This way you can continually rotate from one wheel to the next getting an even 3 coats per wheel. Make sure you purchase a wire brush to scrub the pads clean and extra oil paint brushes. I would recommend 1 large and a couple small ones. This way you can get in those hard to reach areas.Anyway, bottom line. BUY IT. Cheap investment for a nice upgrade. See my before and after picture above!Best,Adam"
2,Coarse setting is too fine,"This grinder works OK, but not great. You have to hold the button down, and even at its coarsest setting it still grinds finer than I'd like for drip coffee. It also produces a lot of powder and coffee dust."
1,Avoid this one,"There are three key design errors in this turkey:1) It makes a mess when you use it. Dust blows right by the seals so you end up cleaning the work area as well as the grinder.2) The grind is uneven. You buy a burr grinder to get an even grind to get consistent brew results. You may as well buy a less expensive blade grinder if you don't care about consistent grind results.3) You have to hold the power switch while it grinds. There are plenty of grinders out there that you turn on and they turn themselves off when they're finished. Doesn't sound like much but in the time it takes to grind a brew's worth of beans, you could done everything else necessary to setup a brew. Holding the button effectively doubles the time it takes to setup a brew.About the only good thing you can say for it is it's pretty."
4,Great for Press Pots,"I received a coffee press, French press, for my birthday and had to get a coffee grinder to chop up my beans. Had one that met an untimely demise when the hubbie dismantled it to give it a good cleaning.... Yet, with grinders you can't use the spinning blade models, which have an inconsistent cut and make basically coffee powder. This model on the largest setting is perfect for the press pot and easy to use. The top lid has a safety feature so that if it's not closed completely it won't work. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is you do have to hold the button down during the whole process. But truth be told- I have only used it for my press pot and not for my espresso maker or percolator."
2,Broke within a week!,"My grinder broke within a week after purchasing it from Target. I would have probably returned it anyway because my BUNN coffeemaker filter overflowed THREE times with the setting on ""Fine"". Yeah, no more messes but yet, no coffee in the AM for now until I get my new one!"
2,Not good for Expresso,"I got this grinder last week and I'll return it today. It's good and quiet for regular coffee machines, but the finest it will grind would not work for espress machines.It's a great price and deal if you only brew regular coffee."
2,Just stopped working,* used for French Press - the button pressing thing - blows!* Only lasted 2 years.* Not worth $40 or even the $20 it is selling at now.I enjoy french pressed coffee. This did well enough for that. Was reading the other comments about it doesn't grind well enough for espresso - very true. But for me... I do not require the grounds that fine. It worked for a while (2Yr) and then it just stopped working this morning. This is my way of venting. I need my effing coffee. For $40 bucks would have expected a longer life out of this product. Meh. Looks like I will have to resort to Barstucks today - BURNT SWILL I TELL YOU!
3,Chapin Gold,"This is a double disc set of one of American's gifted songwriter who is little known, but his message is loud and clear. Disapointed that 10,000 pounds of bananas, the live version, is missing on here. The rest is good for a listen."
4,We need a Sequel,"All of Harry ""Mr. Storyteller's"" Chapin's classics are here with the exception of one glaring omission, ""Sequel"". This song was the sequel to ""Taxi"" and if you play them back to back,""Sequel"" seamlessly continues the story started by ""Taxi"". Sort of a mini series or music. At least ""W*O*L*D*"" and ""Cat's in the Cradle"" are represented here. We still love you Harry. You made us think. And Listen. You'll never be forgotten. Thanks for the music. It was great. It's a shame that it was cut short and silenced long before his time. Great tunes."
2,Disappointed,"I know I didn't spend a lot but the CD's were scratchy,and even got stuck. Really, should have been labelled poor not good."
3,a big disappointment,"when i first ordered this book, i thought i would get a detailed description of the Roman army's legions, wars, and campaigns, as the title suggests. but don't let the title fool you. its actually a rough summery of the Roman empire. very little on the actual wars, legions and campaigns. so if you are just getting into the Roman empire, and don't know much about it, buy this book. otherwise, you're wasting your money, like i did."
1,Unpleasant Surprise,"I have read some other books by this author that I enjoyed, so I was excited to get this one. However, I discovered that this is exactly the same book as one I already had by her by another name ""Bedtime Stories for Lovers III"". Why would you market the same book by another title??? I was very upset to have paid money for the same book."
2,For The Lackluster Marriage,"The stories, without fail, were tame and harmless as a paperplate. I would recommend this book to couples trying to rekindle some sort of bland passion, or to those who feel that holding hands is a type of foreplay."
2,Disappointing,"This books starts off really well. An interesting story, an equally interesting insight by an equally interesting insider. Unfortunately the book degenerates into a tale of I did this and I did that.This book failed to live up to my expectations."
4,Live your dream every day,"Story of an angel investor and ""want-to-be entrepreneurs"". Useful look into the world of startups and finance as well as the theory that you should live and enjoy every day of your life."
3,Didn't live up to billing,"I really liked the idea of this book, but I have to say it didn't live up to its billing. I felt the author could have said everything he needed to say in a single page. And don't get me wrong, his message is a very powerful one...which is that your passion when building a business should be the larger goal - be what it may, instead of just the idea of making a ton of money. As it happens another VC said the same thing to me all those years ago...and in a one sentence: ""follow your passion and the money will come"".So in summary, I think this books serves a purpose depending on the stage of your journey. If you are at the start and haven't heard this kind of message before, then this is worth reading. If you have...you are not going to gain any new insight."
2,Narcissistic Zen Drivel,"This book is intended as a mix Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Who Moved My Cheese. However, it does not work. The author seems in love with himself and his self-discovery that the world of Silicon Valley should mean more than just money. But the author's own experiences belie that. When did the author come to these self-discoveries about ""the journey being more important than the destination""? Probably after he made his own millions. He never tells the readers that. Give us all a break."
5,In the mood,"I ordered this recently because my original is somewhere in storage and I happen to hear one of the songs, by the original artist, recently and I just had to have it in my car. It's great music regardless of the language barrier some may have. Very romantic and easy listening."
5,Canciones De Mi Padre,This is a good album by Linda Ronstat. I think she has an outstanding voice and the mussic is absolutely beautiful. I recommend the album; you can't go wrong.
5,"Outstanding job, Linda, muy bien!","I bought this CD when I started listening to Mexican music a short while ago and love it so much I ordered Mas Canciones within the month, just got Frenesi today. I read one or two reviews putting her down for this...why? Putting down the 'ay ay ay's"" ...why? This is mariachi! I like her better doing this than country or 40's, it really rings true.The songs are lovely, lyrical, will make you cry even if you can't understand them. Try listening to Dos Arbolitos and you'll be won over! Her 2 brothers are also fabulous on this and on Mas Canciones. They should put out an album of their own. You'll love it. Buy it."
2,whisk,Didn't like this whisk at all. Everything sticks in the spring. I've tried many times to use it on different items and still have a difficult time cleaning it out.
4,Pretty good little bibs!,"I got these for my twins to use at about 6 months. The velcro in the back holds tight, the length around the neck is a little snug on them now, and they are 10 months. One of the bibs looks like the inside waterproof part melted and was all scrunched up and not fixable so I threw it out.Other than that, the colors are great! The terry fabric is great, and the waterproof liner that is inbetween is so nice for keeping their shirts dry. Really good bibs over all, I gave it 4 stars because one melted, and the necks are a little tight."
4,"Finally, a bib that doesn't soak through!","I have 5 month old twins that drool like Niagara Falls. I have tried so many types of bibs, it's ridiculolus. Like some of the other reviews said, these are the real deal. My kids drool, and while the front does get soaked sometimes, it does not make it through to the back and make their clothes wet.As another reviewer wrote, I also like the fact that these are solid colors, so they don't clash with outfits the kids are wearing. I am also hesitant about putting these in the dryer (even on low), so I do hang them. They are very thin and dry pretty quickly. And, like others have noted, I also velcro them together before washing because the velcro is very strong.I am hopeful that these will last me longer than other brands have, and will continue to be drool-proof!"
4,In need of bibs?,"So we were in need of bibs so I ordered these. They do the job. I much much much prefer the bibs with the snaps instead of velcro, but they seem much harder to find and much more expensive. The baby cant pull it off like they can with velcro, but the velcro irritates the back of her neck.So they work, great price, and do the job I needed them to do, just wish I had better options for the same price."
5,Fantastic Werewolf book,The stories of four fantastic authors in one volume. Each story is the first book in a wonderful and fascinating Werewolf Series.Moon Lust by Sherri L. KingLunewulf: Pack Law by Lorie O'ClareRunning Mate by Jaci BurtonWolfe's Hope by Lora LeighIf you are a Werewolf fan you have to read this anthology. The stories are fascinating and the heroes are so hot and sexy.
2,Not impressed,I purchased this to get the first installment of Lora Leigh's wolf breeds and was very unimpressed by 3 of the 4 short stories in the book. The second story was the only one that remotely kept my attention focused and sadly it wasn't the Lora Leigh story. Thankfully the future installments of the Wolf Breed series was a significant improvement!I do not recommend this book.
2,Cold Leftovers,"I'm a big Michael Connelly fan, reading everything I can find that's written by him. I expected this to contain stories of his experiences and their impact on him. Instead it was just rehashed newspaper articles, including mind-numbing repetitions. It's like sorting through old, old newspaper clippings that belonged to a dead relative.It's pretty much a rip-off for Connelly fans. Maybe his boat was about to sink and he urgently needed money for the repairs. Maybe the transmission went out in his Porsche. Whatever the motive it was an easy way to make some quick cash without doing any work. Hit ""Control C"" & ""Control V"" a few hundred times and the book's finished.I'll continue to read his novels, but I won't be buying any more of his memoirs. If you want a memoir try Road Work by Mark (Blackhawk Down) Bowden.HRColey"
2,News,"If you want to read of yore news read this book. So, many cases were solved and some others are cold cases, the question is: Where's the plot? Maybe is the story of why MC became a writer but this book is an out and out waste of time, paper and ink. Here you'll find no plot. No thrilling parts. You'll find nothing at all."
5,crime beat,absolutely love this book.... i have finally found someone to keep my attention all through out the book....i love michael !!! awesome!!!!!!!!
4,It Is What It Is,"Don't look here for the polished prose of an experienced crime novelist- these stories are all about the grit, the grime and the smell of death experienced during the ten-year evolution of a young crime reporter often meeting rigorous deadlines on his way to commercial and artistic success.There are minor distractions to be sure- as in the three or so instances narrative seems to be repeated in whole or in part. Yet these trivialities are greatly outweighed by the opportunity to ride shotgun with a highly skilled writer in his formative years.And for that one reason among many, Crime Beat is well worth the read."
1,A Cut & Paste Job,"I suppose that either there's such a demand for Michael Connelly's books (and justifiably so), or he had some sort of contractual deadline which required that he submit something to his publisher, but this is nothing but a cut-and-paste job consisting merely of a collection of his old newspaper reporting. I suppose this would be fine reading if you live someplace where newspapers are not available, but most of the material this book is no better than any other old news stories.What next? A collection of Michael Connelly's grocery lists?Obviously, this book is not worth reading, but if you've a taste for truly superb reporting about LA homicide detectives, the books to get areThe Killing SeasonandHomicide Special: A Year with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unitboth by Miles Corwin, a fine writer."
1,"Unfortunately, A Vanity Project for Connelly","Michael Connelly is probably the best crime writer out there, having written many classic novels such as THE CONCRETE BLONDE, THE POET, and BLOOD WORK. But this book is pretty much just a collection of old newspaper articles he wrote over 20 years ago. Many of the articles are repetitive, and Connelly has not bothered to edit or organize them a fashion to allow for a coherent narrative of any kind.If you're an admirer of Connelly's fiction, there's not very much here to enjoy. This is certainly not worth paying a hardback price for.Instead of this book, I would recommend two first-rate non-fiction books about how homicide detectives do their jobs in the Los Angeles: HOMICIDE SPECIAL and THE KILLING SEASON by LA Times reporter Miles Corwin."
1,No quality control,My sets arrived with numerous imperfections in the glazing. This is 99cent store sloppyness. I suspect that Pfaltzgraff has dumped low quality product on amazon and that earlier versions of these pieces may be better quality. One dinner plate actually has a knick in the the rim with glaze over it. I would never invest in anything by this company again. BUYER BEWARE.
1,Don't buy these dishes!,I've had these dishes now for about 5 years and regret the day I purchased them. They have fine cracks throughout every piece and are unusable in the microwave because they get SO HOT you can't handle them. I will never buy Pfaltzgraff again.
5,Perfect!!!!!!,"Thank you!! is the best solution for my shoes, I have a lot of humidity in my closet so I have to put my shoes out of it and with this rack is the perfect solution, and the seller sent it on time and perfect conditions"
1,Not sturdy,This Shoe rack has to be assembled. It's not sturdy when built. It could not hold my shoes without calapsing. There is no way it could actually hold 30 pairs of shoes.
1,Junk,This storage rack falls apart at the slightest bump. I used it for three days before removing it from the closet and replacing it with wall hung shelving.
1,................,"This item is a complete piece of crap... don't waste your money. While the order arrived promptly, the box the rack was in was dirty & mangled. Upon removing the shoe rack, I discovered that it was also dirty & in poor condition. Never ordering anything from CashCo1000 again."
5,Sturdy and Durable (Great Product - Great Price),"I have had a great experience with my 30 pair shoe rack! It is very sturdy, and seems quite durable. There were a couple key tips on the assembly instructions, that I would recommend paying attention to. I'd assume if you do that, you shouldn't have a problem with your shoe rack ""breaking"". All in all, I have found this to be a great product - and for a great price!"
2,Ditto on the shoe rack collapse...,"Well, we faired a little better than the previous reviewer; we managed to have our shoe rack for 3 months before it collapsed. I emailed the company this morning to see what can be done. The rack was certainly not holding 50 pairs of shoes, but now I have a huge mess in my laundry room. Spend the extra money and buy something more sturdy....I know we will."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I just wanted to let you know that it is kind of light weight and flimsy, so don't expect some solid construction like I did; that being said, it does its job and my closet looks a lot better!"
1,very bad quality,"I bought this shoe rack because I thought it would be cheaper than at walmart, well it was not cheaper and it was very difficult to assemble and even after it was assembled it always keeps falling apart I didn't like it at all."
3,It only works if you use it,"I have the 20 piece rack. It works if you don't have a fat cat trying to be a pair of shoe's himself on the top rack. It withstood his 20 lb weight so I'm going to purchase another set to extend the extra 20 shoes I bought this past year. I wish it was made out of metal and had an alternating size width/height so I could put BOOTS inside it too. I hate crushing my boots. I think I'll have to clamp this to the wall, otherwise, it tips over and there are shoe's everywhere. I've had the first one for almost 6 months and its still in one piece. I change my shoes twice daily, so you just have to learn to use it and not kick off the shoes near it, or else you'll have a pile of shoe's towering over the rack near by."
2,It's alright,"The biggest problem with this product is that for how tall it is, once you put all the shoes on it the shelves lean foward so you have to anchor it to the back wall :("
5,Super hot sauce with FLAVOR,"I brought this hot sauce from Ecuador because it tasted so darn great. It has a wonderful fruity flavor in addition to some heat which makes it far more interesting than the typical just hot sauce. I use it on eggs, fish, meat and almost anything and everything. So glad I can get it without flying into Quito!"
2,MMM,I sent this to my uncle and aunt in Holland and it took some time for them to tell me the truth. They did not likethe quality of the sound. Not recommending this. I am hoping they do not think I bought it at some flea market...
5,As good as it gets!,"I have a huge music collection, and would consider myself as well-versed in country music as most. ""Waylon Live"" was one of my top 5 country albums when it was an 11 track LP. Now, it's a 42 track, 2 CD set. I honestly feel that Waylon may have been the best musical artist in the world in the early seventies. He had struggled for years to find his sound (and the freedom to express it). When he finally did, the passion and intensity was amazing. As soon as he made it, self-parody, drugs and ""tongue in cheek"" humor took the wind out of his ""musical sails"". The peak of Waylon's powers are captured here, and (IMO)there has never been a release that is any better. Waylon had a completely unique sound, Ralph Mooney is amazing, and the songs are uniformly great. This is desert island stuff. Thank you Waylon for sharing your talent, and thank you RCA for FINALLY releasing this the way it should be (although I know, this would have been a 4 LP(!) set!)."
5,Essential For Your Collection,"As a Waylon fan, I am particular to his live recordings - so I say this is a ""must-have"". It is arguably one of country music's best live albums (like ""The Who: Live at Leeds"" is, for all you rock-n-roll fans), so make sure it is in your collection. You'll want to listen to this one over and over!"
3,"*** 1/2, Strong solo.","""Can't Look Away"" #111 (1989).Trevor Rabin releases his 4th studio album, hot of the heels of 2 classic albums with Yes, he release a very strong solo. You get the hit ""Something (To Hold On To)"", #3 MSR, the title track a epic progressive 7 1/2 minute number, the passionate rocker ""Sorrow (Your Heart)"", ""Sludge"", is a good workout and ""Promises"", is just a lovely pop-rocker. Great guitar playing on this disc. Yes fan's of the 80's, should get this album."
1,Terrible,This DVD must've been made in the 80s. My daughter hated it. I'd like my money back. Totally not worth any amount if money
2,If you need music scrubbed clean for kids...,"Then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else? The songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals, which arguably weren't that bad (""What a girl wants"" and ""Get this party started"" were fairly tame to begin with). Just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds."
4,Good guide to clothing organization,This is a well written guide to organizing your clothes. This book will give you a good basis to customize your wardrobe without breaking your bank account. This book is good for all time and not just the now.
2,Marginal disks,I had a hard time finding a player that would play all four sides without stutters and pixilation. Maybe a freak problem in production but it makes watching all chapters hard on all but one player.
5,THE KILLER SOUL CD OF THE EIGHTIES,"This is according to me Keith's first and best album with SlowKillers like ""Make it Last"", or ""The Rain"". Just listen to it andyou'll never get bored from this classical soul/New jack SwingCD with magic vocals from a genius. It's simply a MASTERPIECE.(A fan from Keith Sweat since 1987)."
5,Cab-Forward ~ The story of Southern Pacific,My husband just loved this book. There is so much information and great illustrations. He reads it often. It's a real Keeper.
5,Awesome!!!,"Anyone who is saying this CD isn't good because it doesn't have Tim or Brady on it is just crazy!! This is the best CD they have ever released. Porter sounds so much better then Tim. Brady didn't even do lead vocals that much and he isn't that big of a loss and the same for Tim. It's a shame this music isn't getting the air play with radio. It's a big loss for country listeners. I don't know about everyone else but I'm sick of radio just playing only the ""top 10"" over and over. There is so much more out there. Most of it sounds better then what is being played!! Good job Little Texas!! I love the song The Reason and Party Life.....and I could just keep going because every song on this disc is great!!!"
5,stained glass grape vine panel,I received this beautiful panel today in perfect condition! Was nervous due to several previous buyers reporting they received this item damaged. I like this so much I am ordering a second one! Please package and ship this second panel in the same excellent way.
4,Very good condition,"My book arrived at time and in a very good conditionn, only the cover was kind of damaged but it's ok, it was very cheap and the content is in a very good condition"
2,Not the best product from Adidas.,"Ive usually been very satisfied with adidas, but i was a bit dissapointed with these socks....though they look real good, i found the quality is not too good. After the first wash i got major lint balls on them !!! and now upon closer inspection i noticed the top mesh part is starting to fall apart (after 5 months), i think elastic is breaking down or something. I dont use them that much to begin with. since i bought them i may have used them 10 times or less to give you an idea...so save your money and buy something of better quality such as ""Thorlo"", it may be a bit pricier, but... in the long run will last longer."
4,"Strong character development, mystery is a little weak.","I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book was not a page turner. However, I still think it was a very good book, just not terribly strong as a mystery. The food descriptions, and Ms. Richman's knowledge of food and the industry is incredibly strong and accurate. The characters are interesting and realistically developed. It is a very enjoyable read, and I recommend it!"
2,Very disappointed,"Having read and re-read the first two Chas Wheatley mysteries, I was very disappointed with this one. Most books I can hardly put down, this one I had trouble picking up each time I would slog through a chapter. The murder comes way too late and the solution spins out way too fast. I'm looking forward to Book 4 and hopefully a return to the page turner category."
3,Great Classic Thrash,"No Place For Disgrace is a classic thrash album by Jason Newstead's former band.(At least no one ever accused Flotsom of selling out.) I am not sure if he played on this album, though. This is old -school, rapid fire thrash album with great songs. I recommend this album to those who enjoy old albums by Exodus, Anthrax, Death Angel ect. The only reason I rate this so low is due to the horrible guitar tone. Yuck. Very fuzzy and sounds like a Sears guitar and a ten dolloar pedal,plugged directly into the board. 3.5 Stars"
4,Where are the Scoundrels,I enjoyed reading this story very much.Although we have gained much with the freedoms in society; this book makes me wonder if we haven't lost something more too. One can only hope that we would all find a scoundrel that is also a gentleman.
3,"Slow, melodic and unassuming","I bought this album after hearing ""Heather Remind Me How This Ends"", which is shaping up to be my favorite song of the year so far (the song also reminds me of Mojave 3). Although the other songs on this album don't quite have the quality of ""Heather,"" they still are very sincere and quiet. The music is lazy (in a good way) and the melodies are effortlessly sublte.This album is for fans of Red House Painters and to a lesser degree, Mojave 3."
3,I have expected more,There are two excellent tracks on this record - Dominion and This Corrosion. But when guys lose pace and rhytm it sounds just like they were hundred years old with no lust to live. This kind of music must be like 200 octane fuel - when you can't take it any more it must burn and fire you up until you drop dead. This is no place for ballads and sentiments: this must be full time action - therefore sounds sometimes awfully misplaced. But two mentioned tracks gives you a hint how others are supposed to sound like.
3,Half a good album,"The first half of this album is absolutely wonderful, from the blase fatalism of Dominion/Mother Russia to the overblown theatrics of This Corrosion. But the second half is just sorta there -- it sounds like it was thrown in to fill out side-B after This Corrosion. Even worse are the two bonus tracks -- I like the idea of adding extra material to expand a 45 minute tape to a decent CD length, but in practice the extras almost invariably turn out to be material that didn't make the original album for good reason.Still, the first half of the album is good, and if I set my CD player to repeat after the fifth track it's as good as First and Last and Always."
3,Let the Punker Beware!,"This album was little more than a curio for me; a power trio where all three play keyboards. Weird idea. I decided I had to hear it. Most would have recommended buying STARING AT THE SEA first, but I wasn't having that. It would have to be one or the other. I'm wishing now that I'd gotten the other. This is far from a great album. Any one of the songs on it could appear on a great album, hypothetically, but when taken together it's ALMOST enough to sink the whole Endeavor. What gets me most is the drumming. Guitars, keyboards, the occasional upright bass--atmospherics they have in spades, but that whole 1982 thud in the mix just sounds hokey. The album's reputation likely stems from its ability to wig anyone out on the first listen (as it did me) no matter what their background, and is just a fragment of the Cure's unquestioned overall genius. Unfortunately that first impression is not reinforced by repeated play."
5,Genius!,"Weird Al --- The man is plain amazing.The parodies are classics. I know Eminem didn't want him to make a video for ""Couch Potato"", but I'd love to see a video for ""A Complicated Song"" -or- ""Trash Day"". The Billy Joel parody ""Ode to a Superhero"" is fantastic. There is no weak parts on this CD. Every track is pure comic genius. And Weird Al knows how to make the songs just like the original artists do them. He is fantastic. The original track ""Bob"" is a nice funny homage to Bob Dylan. I've been waiting for someone to make fun of Bob for quite some time. His polka track is cool. I must say Wierd Al saying ""Mutha"" in ""Down with the sickness"" is just worth about a thousand laughs. This CD is among the best in my collection. This is why Wierd Al is national treasure."
5,Is it just me or....,Does Wanna B UR lover remind you of the Flight of the Conchords? Whenever I hear this song I have this weird image of the Conchords performing it.
5,Great album by Weird Al yet again,"Weird Al ceases to impress the music lover of parodies and lighthearted music that makes you laugh. Between more 'serious' love ballads and absurd songs about Frank's 2000"" TV, Weird Al will always make you laugh. I believe this is an excellent album and worth the money. If you want a few more songs or just his greatest hits I would point you towards his newThe Essential Weird Al Yankovic. It gives you all the best songs of his without maybe some of the ones you might otherwise skip over."
3,Same Tired Formula,"Weird Al sticks to the same tired formula he's been doing for 3 or 4 decades in a row now and got the two big ones here- Backstreet Boys and Emenem. Don't forget Disturbed. These sell outs deserved to be parodied because once you lose your sense of humor about something, more people will laugh AT it, but Weird Al just seems tired. And of course Ebay. What he does is he dates subjects parodied really bad the year it was made."
4,"Tastes great, and less filling too","Wierd Al has released another disc half full of parodies with some original songs for filler. I rushed to the store this morning to get my copy and was not disappointed at all. I don't think that this is his best work ever, but it is loaded with fun little references, so who cares. I don't think it will end up seeing as much play time in my car as his previous CD did, but then who knows.. maybe it'll grow on me.I would get the CD if only for the Avril parody!!!"
4,Still got it,"Good disc. The production seems a little flat sometimes, especially on ""A Complicated Song"" - that just needs more punch. ""Angry White Boy Polka"" is funny. Couch Potato is funny, too. Buy it!"
2,Easily his worst,"This album makes me want to bash my head in with a blunt instrument. And I'm a pretty big Al fan. But darn it, I can't believe he actually did a Frank Zappa style parody on the last song! Whee!!! But seriously, Al really let me down with this one. After ""Running With Scissors"", this one takes another step down and will leave you shaking your head wondering what happened to the Al we all love. Come back Al! You're drowning in the shallow end of the pool!"
3,Weird Al wears one too many hats.,"Al displays a few gems in this new effort, but a few also miss the mark. ""Party at the Leper Colony"" has a nice driving beat and the parody of Billy Joel's Piano Man exhibits Al's classic trademarks, but others such as ""Genius in France"" are of the same genre as ""Albuquerque"" on RUNNING WITH SCISSORS and are, well, somewhat innane.The parody of Eminem's song from 8 MILE is probably alright if you are into rap, but I guess the feel is somewhat lost on those of us that find this form of music less than entertaining.One does need to give Al his due on remaining topical, with his song about auctions on eBay and current trends in television, etc. Credit is also due to Al, or whoever, is doing the auction style of speed talking during the obligatory polka medley."
4,Dori,I used to find Dori too mellow for me but seeing him live I gained an appreciation for his great rhythm guitar playing. he is one of the great masters of Brazilian guitar. As usual I prefer the upbeat numbers but this is a good record.
1,Rasta Jamz,I don't like this CD at all. I thought it was reggae.The seller did provide fast delivery.
1,Poor Quality for My Man Jess,The quality of this DVD set is horrid. It is worse than some all region DVDs I've seen.I love Laramie and will hold out for a better quality product as this is unwatchable. It was with a sad heart I had to return the set as I so loved Laramie as a very small child. Let's hope for a better product down the line with all the seasons.The one bright spot on this DVD set was the extensive interview with Robert Fuller. What a delight he is to listen to with his many memories. He deserves so much better than a poor image of Jess and that of the Laramie episodes.
2,Laramie the 3rd season,"I love the show, and the acting is terrific, however the video is terrible. I really do not think I have seen a worse DVD as far as quality goes. Timeless does give a disclaimer saying that they've done the best they could, but considering the money I paid for it, it should have been loads better than what it is."
5,Review,Character development is great. Can see both Jess and Slim developing through the series. Wonderful gift idea for anyone who is a western lover.
1,Amazon verified purchase,Never received product. Was notified by email that the order was being cancelled with no explanation. I responded with a request for an explanation and never received a response.
1,RAMY Eye Grow Brows- not really,There has been no improvement in my brows since using the product. I would not purchase this product again.
2,"Read one, you've read them all.","This was cutting edge years ago, but lately the magazine is repeating itself with old information. The art work is great and so is some of the info if you never read one before. There are a lot of advertisements for products that they offer in their online stores. There is nothing in these that is entertaining, little humor, lots of emphases on only production fishing and that take the fun out of it."
1,Where is it at?,Have not received this yet so I can't really give a any better review. When I receive the first issue I will adjust the rating. Thought it would be here by now.
5,Works great! Saved me alot of $$$ compared to canon chargers.,This charger works great so far.. charged my battery in about an hour! It was only about $8 with shipping.. A brand new Canon charger is about $40! This works just as well.
4,"Regina, Regina","This happens to be my favorite Regina Spektor song, and she added a second song to the single to make it even sweeter. Awesome single!"
3,One of the better ones.............,I have read many Elinor Lipman books and I found this to be one of the better ones. The characters were interesting and I found my self wishing there was more history on each of them. I wanted the book to go back 20 years and start the story there. I was very dissapointed with end and the revelations about Margaret - really didn't think it was necessary and did not add anything to the book or to the character.
4,"I liked it, even though it was very light reading.","I agree with the other reviews, in that this book didn't pack as big a punch as the rest of Lipman's work... but I really liked it anyways.She writes the best characters with the best dialogue, and that's good enough for me.The story revolves around the character's, Sunny's, mother's death, and the plot then spins out to involve everyone in this NH town with every character having their own fun quirks and mini-plot.Wait for paperback if you must, but it's a must read for Lipman fans. Enjoy!"
1,raja anwar is a lier,I KNOW THIS PERSON SINCE ALONG TIME. HE IS AN OPPORTUNIST. HE IS THE MOST SELFISH PERSON I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. HE WROTE THIS BOOK IN PULE CHARKHI JAIL TO SAVE HIS LIFE. THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME HAD DECIDED TO HANG HIM BECAUSE IT WAS PROVED DURING HIS TRIAL THAT HE WAS AN INFORMER FOR C.I.A AND THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN. HE WAS GIVIUNG INFORMATION TO GEN. SAWAR KHAN WHO WAS THE GOVERNER OF PUNJAB PROVINCE AT THAT TIME.IT WAS GEN SAWAR WHO SENT HIM TO AFGHANISTAN.HE WAS COUGHT RED HANDED BY MURTAZA BHUTTO WHILE HE WAS DELIVERING A LETTER TO THE CMMISSIONER OF N.W.F.P.THROUGH ONE OF HIS CLOSED FRIENDS (RASHEED)BOTH OF THEM WERE HANDED OVER TO KHAD OFFICALS. THEY WERE IMPRISONED IN PULE CHARKHI JAIL. HE WROTE THIS BOOK TO GET SYMPATHIES OF THE THEN MARXIST REGIME OF AFGHANISTAN. SAEED KHAN U.A E
2,Minor cracks,There are several minor cracks throughout the piece. Not real noticable though. Nice piece for the price.
2,Get what you pay for,Looked for an inexpensive laser pointer for my feline companion. Still functions but there is clearly something malfunctioning at the contact point of the button. The laser flickers if the button is not depressed at a certain angle.
2,Low Quality,"When I got it it worked just fine. After a couple of days, though, the screw that you used to close it to keep the batteries from falling out was becoming worn away, and eventually was useless, and now I have to hold it together with both hands to keep the top part of it from falling off."
5,Poewrful Laser Pointer,"I have rechargeable AAA batteries and this laser pointer works great. I would also consider it to be a heavy laser pointer, something I prefer. The laser pointer preforms great at work and the cats seem to enjoy it too. I do find myself recharging my batteries often however."
4,Best deal,The price is great for how stylish and solid the pen is. Shipping was fast. Feels good in your hand too. (That's what she said)Only complaint is that the laser is not completely straight but you would never notice.I would definetly buy this again.
1,Might be a good item... if mine had worked,The one I received failed to function with the included batteries. Thinking they might just be dead I installed Duracell AAA's and the thing started to smoke. Maybe it was just a fluke.
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!","I had this CD in college and wore it out. The songs on this CD are not available on iTunes and I've been dying to listen to them again. I was so excited to get this CD into my hands and I""ve been listening to it non-stop! LOVE IT!"
5,"Don't Gamble, get a brother's OEM","Had the same printer for years already.It is a good and strong brother's printer.In fact I have 2 fax machines and 2 printers by brothers.I have tried non-OEM brother's toner. You may get lucky and print a few hundred off them.But eventually they will turn bad one way or another.All in all I have gone through over 15 toners and drums.I no longer take the risk of saving money to buy non-OEM.I now only buy OEM Brother's and I am writing this review to tell everyone this.Don't be cheap and by another brand, because you might just lose all your money.Make sure you buy from Amazon also because other vendors tend to ship you the fake one.I have found these at Costco Business, but they are the exact same cost as Amazon.I have looked everywhere and Amazon and Costco are the best prices.Bite the bullet and buy OEM."
3,"Was hoping it would be better, but it gets the job done","I was hoping it would be a bit better. Gel based, but not quite thick enough and slides off of ""things"". As for with my stoker toys, still gums up after a while. I think the other ID glide stuff is better but both gum up and require more to be applied."
1,Bad product,"This product is horrible. It's not worth the money. I am not sure if everyone else that has posted good comments has only used horrible lube, so thought this stuff was good, but it's not. I have always used Euros. Works great!! I got Slipper Stuff because there was more for the money, but you have to use SO much because it keeps drying out!!! With Euros you only need a few drops and it goes a long ways and it does not leave a sticky residue like this product does.So, overall this product is sticky and dries out way too quick."
1,No better than water,"I know this stuff is priced cheap, but you get what you pay for. You're better off buying something more expensive that only needs one application. You have to apply this so often that it's not worth the price."
1,Beware: Chips easily,"I loved the pattern, but the edges of lids chipped the first month I had them. This is true of bowls and plates in this pattern also. I had collected an entire set of dishes over a year, but am now looking to replace them with a different pattern. Very disappointed."
3,WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY,"EASY TO USE, GREAT BATTERY LIFE. ONLY DOWN FALL... HEAVIER THEN I WAS EXPECTING.THE BELT CAN SLIP OUT OF THE PACK IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL WHEN IT IS NOT ON YOUR BODY SO JUST BE SURETO ALWAYS CLICK IT TOGETHER WHEN NOT IN USE. WHEN THE BELT SLIPS THROUGH IT IS A NUISANCE TO FEEDTHROUGH AGAIN. EASY TO CHARGE."
3,Be cautious,"Packaging was extremely damaged upon arrival but the truck and crane appeared to be in good condition. Being a christmas present i didnt open and fully inspect every piece , However on christmas day once my son had opened the package we found that the trailer hitch had been broken and no longer allows the trailer to hook up to the truck. 2 semi /w trailer and both are broken right out of the package in the exact same spot. more than a coicidence"
5,Excellent Center speaker,Great range of sound from the highest highs to good mid bass punch.PLays music and movies well.
5,christ mediation cd,I really enjoyed listening to this cd alotI t is really a nice cd tape about jesus I really enjoyed it alot
4,Shows promise!,"This first in the Mitchell & Markby series holds quite a bit of promise. It is certainly a modern version of the English village mystery. Ms. Granger writes a book with a tight plot and believable characters. We discover that Meredith Mitchell is a diplomatic worker who has come home to England for the wedding of her god-daughter who is also a cousin. She visits a poky little English village, and discovers that a whole lot of evil is going on behind the scenes. It results in a murder, and Meredith is thrown in with the local Police Inspector. She finds herself helping him with solving the puzzle, much to Markby's chagrin. The play between these two characters is interesting to watch, and I am looking forward to reading more in this series."
4,Thumbs up,"OK, let me start out to say that I'm not one of those die-hard Law & Order fans, just a casual fan. Surprisingly, the game is better than I thought. Easy to get into, but not made for dummies either. I liked that they tried to make things logical. (I have been annoyed at other games that solutions to puzzles required to read the minds of the people who made it, or even worse, an hour of trial and error.) The voices are good as it does seem like the TV show and the plot is worthy as well. Don't expect a lot of action, though (but would you really if you have ever watched the show?) as it's a lot of talking. But it works. All in all, if you like the show and like to think, I would recommend it."
3,A good short story for children,Who doesn't know the story of the good William Tell and the bad Baron Geischler? It is a classic animated cartoon on a classic story.
2,I had high hopes,"I had high hopes for this workbook, based on the sheer number of lessons, colorful cover, and price. At first, I was disappointed by the ""slick"" pages that don't hold pencil well. It doesn't matter how hard you push on the pencil, you still can't see the writing very well. Erasing, even with a good quality eraser, is impossible and just leaves smudges. I was going to use this (along with manipulatives) for our main math curriculum, but there was next to no instruction and I found it to be a little too fast moving. I ended up giving these books away. I would only recommend using them as a supplement by topic, not as a methodical, cover-to-cover workbook."
5,better than expected,"my kid works on this book everyday, she loves it. drawings are simple, well done, and help the task. she particularly likes the star reward system, she can't wait to finish a page to place one of the golden star stickers by that page number's spot. i recommend this very complete book."
4,Math Made Easy:Second Grade,"Good practices, BUT pages are not pencil-friendly (meaning you can't see the writing, but just an indent). Therefore, my child has had to write everything in pen, which isn't a good thing when you're ""practicing""."
3,Gramma and Me 8 bits a bit short,"I love ""Gramma and Me"" and so does my great-grandson. Unfortuntately, my computer does not! I knew it was old software, but didn't realize it was only 8 bits (this would have been nice to know beforehand)!I can live with it, but it re-sets my graphics each time we use it, and I have to re-set it.However, if you can live with that...this is a great interactive software program for youngsters and oldsters alike.Best with older technology!"
2,"It'd be great, only if it worked..","The interactive book is really well put together, and it was fun playing with the online book with my four year old, but the BIG PROBLEM is that the CD has lots of glitches. Every minute or so, the screen reverts back to the introduction page no matter where you are in the story, which means that you have to start the story all over, again and again and again..Not fun... but I guess you get what you pay for... at six dollars and some change.."
4,Compelling.,"I read this book about two years ago. This book has an ample amount of ingredients for success. This is definitely one of those types of books you can read over and over again for insight and inspiration. This book is not just tailored to RE/MAX and its concept but also structured to give one an adequate start or ongoing reference for ideas. I will save the gutts of the company's ascent for your on curiosity and review. This book is full of lessons on perseverance. Especially when at the brink of ruination.RE/MAX represents a model of bold innovation, constant change and improvement, high levels of persistence, energy and passion. At RE/MAX, everyone's truly in business for themselves and not for the company they work in. That's the difference!"
4,Servide,"Although I have ordered numerous generic replacement parts that worked well, I have never found generics for this printer that worked well. This one did."
5,Very good product!,"It works great, am still using it without any problem, and best of all I was able to get it at a really reduced price. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Great workhorse,This Brother multi-function printer continues to please. I print a lot of docs and this workhorse continues going about its business without a hickup...which is what I expect from a printer/copier/fax; no problems. And the drum unit and toner cartridge are very easy to change without getting toner all over the place like some.
3,Brother Drum Unit,Works fine but the print is lighter than with the original factory drum unit. Seems like a remanufacture to me.
3,"Traditional, Modest Architecture","I'm in agreement with the reviewer who wrote that this book is mostly about traditional not modern architecture and design. When I got this book, I was hoping that contempory would mean modern and upscale. This book does not deliver any of that and the book cover photo is not the type of designs that are found in the rest of the book so I was terribly disappointed. Eventually, I grew to tolerate the traditional design photos ( which are mostly of churches, huts, cane worker houses and store shacks), but if you're looking for upscale design ideas, select another book and relegate this one to a fond look at old, dilapidated island style."
5,Perfect bottle,"Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies. My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only. My second daughter only liked these, if it wasn't mommy (if ya know what I mean). You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well, to cut back on cost. Another bonus is there is less clean up. Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding."
3,They let in too much air!,The nipples of these bottles let in too much air in the corners of my childs mouth. I wish I hadn't purchased so many after reading all the good reviews. I ended up swithching to Dr. Brown's bottles and really love them. Although the Dr. Brown's bottles have a tendancy to leak even when filled below the green line as directed. My baby doesn't get so fussy with them though as she does with the other bottles.
3,"The concept is great, but the nipple is too flimsy","The concept of not scrubbing the bottles is just great, the plastic bottle and the disposable bags are all good.My baby does not like this bottle however because the nipple is too soft and flimsy and shaped a bit strange. The wide nipple for Born Free bottles is the best."
4,good bottles,"playtex is always a go to brand for bottles. its a brand that parents can trust. These bottles worked great, just as I expected them to."
4,Love the Bottle wish I could choose color.,"I love this bottle. We introduced it to our son at about 1 month and he has never had trouble with gas when feeding. I would rate the Bottle a 5 plus, but I would rate this particular pack a 3. I wish you could choose the colors. I ordered two packs and 4 of the bottles had the pink tops. I opened the packs because I was kind of in a bind and was running low on bottles. We hate to use them in public cause they are overly girly. One of the bottles has little girls dresses and hats on the side. I wouldn't mind the pink so much if it was a more neutral design."
2,"CUTE, BUT VARY HARD TO MEASURE THE WATER",I Love the origanel nurser so I tried theses new ones because of how cute they are; How ever the 'cute' curvy line and pictures around the numbers make it vary hard to accuretly measure the water. Also the new drop in bottle liners have clear numbers and lines. Put the two together and it's nearly imposible to see to measure the water. Playtex needs to fix one or the other.
3,How about some gender-neutral colors?,"I know it says ""colors may vary,"" but pink?!? If you aren't going to allow a choice, how about at least shipping these with gender-neutral colors?"
4,A Gift New Moms Will Appreciate,"The Playtex Drop-Ins 8 ounce Bottle System Nurser with slow flow nipple is for ages 0-3 months. These bottles mimic breastfeeding and reduce gas and colic because the pre-sterilized disposable liners keep air out.This 3-bottle pack nurser system was really designed to help the baby switch between breast and bottle. The slow flow nipple replicates the natural flow of the breast so that the baby takes in the right amount. The lids are easy to pop on and off, one-handed.The bottles are easy to store and freeze directly in the liner. This kit includes three baby bottle nursers, lids and nipple. The liners and breast milk storage kit, including pump, are sold separately. Replacement liners, though, can be purchased inexpensively. So if this will be a gift you might want to buy a box of liners and offer both as a gift."
1,wrong measurements!!,"very disappointed with these bottles. The measurements on the bags and on the bottle do NOT match up. We have been giving our daughter wrongly mixed formula, and couldn't understand why she wasn't finishing her bottles. only just realized how incorrect the bottle measurements are. Also, very difficult to measure how much formula is left, and have had the experience a few times of trying to take out the air, and having the bag collapse. big waste of $, would NOT recommend these bottles."
2,I love the system but the plastic warps and shrinks easily!,"I love the Playtex drop-ins system in general. My 2 1/2 month old does very well with these bottles. I had to go back to work full-time at 8 weeks so the convenience of this system is great. I have a Medela Freestyle pump and I bought thePlaytex Nursing Necessities One Step Breast Milk Storage Kitso that I can pump directly into the drop ins. It saves me a lot of bottle washing time. However, my big complaint with this system is the nursers themselves. I've had to buy 3 different sets because they keep getting warped. First my husband boiled them to sterilize them, not realizing it was just the nipples that were supposed to be boiled before first use. They shrank and warped. Then he put one in the bottle warmer (against my advice) and it also warped. I understand that Playtex advises against boiling these bottles, but would it really be such a big deal to manufacture them with plastic that could withstand a little heat?"
3,8 oz???,"I love these bottles for a lot of reasons. They're easy to clean, the variety of nipples available, and my little honey bunny doesn't spit up as much because of air. But, the so called 8 oz liners don't hold 8 oz. I found they barely hold 7 oz. So now that my daughter is moving into 8 oz bottles, I have to buy something different."
3,Great design but Amazon sent me three year old bottles.,"The product itself is great. I have used them with my older kids and have purchased again for my child due next month. I love the drop ins design, because it saves time and effort when cleaning. The only thing you have to boil is the nipples. The nipples themselves are great for a breastfeeding child. The bag collapses as the baby feeds, so she gets less air.My concern is that Amazon seems to be keeping older bottles in stock, so I have a concern that I may not have gotten the latest design of this bottle. The design of the cap is slightly different (not a big deal, I guess). The coupons included with the bottles expired three years ago, so I know they must have been on the shelf a while."
4,Prostate recovery,Amazon ships quickly and the product was less expensive than others with results that were just as good. I would recommend this for those that need artificial lube.
4,Not bad for the price!,"I bought this camera for a trip to the Galapagos Islands, and it was a winner.What I like about this camera:--Very sturdy.--Grippy rubber outside & lanyard (with carabiner clip), makes it easy to hang on to.--Video feature is fun, and having sound makes it even better.--Big buttons make it easy to operate under water.--Can't beat the price...this camera costs about half what my friends paid for underwater housings for their expensive cameras.What I don't like about this camera:--No viewfinder, just an LCD screen. That's fine indoors, but in the water, with glare on the screen, it's difficult to see what you're filming. I ended up just pointing and hoping for the best.--The color is a little off on pictures taken out of the water (admittedly, this may be operator error...)"
1,not happy!!!,I thought it was going to be great. I used this in the Caymen Islands and thought it worked great taking under water pictures while snorkling and visiting Sting Ray City. The next day we went to swim whith the Dolphins and I couldn't take any pictures!! Some how water got into the camera!!!I didn't do anything different so I was not happy it ruined all my pictures on the SD card...
1,There is not such thing as this CD,I ordered this because I had never heard of it.well guess what it's not real. It's a typo.
1,So bad it's fascinating,"Everything about this CD, from its bizarre muscial arrangements to Feinstein's smarmy crooning, is so strangely tacky that it almost qualifies as worthwhile. It's certainly unique, possibly camp -- to be placed on the record shelf alongside Bette Davis's last LP. Feinstein is a monotonous, untalented singer, and the heterosexual lyrics are laughable coming from his throat. A great gag gift!"
3,This cd is perhaps Michaels' finest contribution yet,"I may be wrong, but i think this is Michaels' finest cd yet. Let me try to explain why i think so. First off, he used Johnny Mandel to produce and arrange his music. Secondly, his material for this cd seems better than any other offering. Plus his voice appears as great as i have ever heard it. With all these plusis, i don't see how this project could not be his finest. I just wish Michael could turn out more quality work like this.I WOULD LIKE TO STRONGLY, STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS CD"
4,Great storage box,"The size and soft interior of this storage box makes it ideal for storing my men's jewelry and other small random items. It has a stylish look that works well with the contemporary decor of my bedroom. As noted by another reviewer, be careful opening up the top two compartments if you don't have anything heavy in the bottom compartment or it will easily tip over."
1,Does not work as advertised.,"I have owned this model circuit detective for nearly a year. I have tried multiple times and have NEVER had it detect a correct circuit. I have followed the directions to the letter to no avail. I have contacted the company and even sent my unit to the company (Hi-Tech) asking for a replacement under the ""lifetime warranty"", only to be told that there was nothing wrong with the unit and that I must be doing something wrong. It does not work as advertised. Save your money and find a helper to hollar when you flip the correct breaker."
2,HI-Tech HTP-6 Detective Circuit Breaker Finder,"The product takes some getting use to. It will give false readings at times which are distractive enough. The ON/OFF switch is extremely sensitive and will turn on at the slightest touch.The unit is accurate roughly 2/3rd of the time, so I guess for the price paid not terribly bad. Disappointed somewhat-especially with the microprocessor inside not providing reliable results."
4,A Beautiful Movie,"It is a beautiful movie which did get the spirit of Esther. It may not be completely biblically accurate, but there was nothing that took away from the story or message. It is much more accurate than some of the classics, such as `The Ten Commandments'.The movie is very well done. The acting was very good, the scenery and the sets were very beautiful. There was a lot of effort to use symbolism, such as a pendant, rain, etc. It was an effective way to portray loyalties, emotion, and drama throughout the movie.It was a respectful and worthy tribute to the story of Esther. It is definitely a movie worth seeing."
3,Do they own a Bible?,"While I thought this was an excellent movie, I was very surprised that it so loosely followed the Bible. I am wondering at this point, if the people who wrote the script own one, or if they even know what one looks like. The odd thing is that the Bible's version, the true version, is so much more exciting than the one depicted in this film. The sad thing is that many will watch this, thinking that it is from the Bible, but it is not. This movie would have been better if they had left the Bible totally out of it, or kept to the original script, the one written by God."
2,Boring,They spent too much time trying to tell the story and make it interesting when the story as originally told in the bible is exciting enough. It didn't need the hollywood spin that they put on it. Read the story as told in the bible. Read the story and skip the movie.
3,OUTSTANDING,"This movie totally blew me away. It was so stunning. The scenery, the writing and an actual plot with strong characters. I rate it up there with the 10 Commnadments with Charlton Heston. Luke Goss so humanizes the king it's so unbelieiveable and Tiffany Dupont a royal beauty.A movie with NO bad language, NO sex and strong charatcters. It can still be made."
1,One Night With the King,"The beauty and majesty of the story is overshadowed by a terrible screenplay and very poor editing. My family was constantly asking ""What is going on""? Some of the acting also lacks credibility. Tiffany Dupont is radiant in the role of Esther, but Luke Goss leaves much to be desired."
5,Amazing,We studied this in our bible study group. So I bought the movie for a fun night after the study was over. We very much enjoyed the movie and the costumes.
1,Wrenched,"I was quite shocked after viewing this DVD. The story is wrenched, filled with fantasy and magic, nothing near the original story.The Esther in this story has a special necklace (amulet/talisman) that shines stars of David when light strikes it. She loses it and gets it back a few times in the story. This special necklace is what finally comes to her rescue. If they really wanted to squiggle this shining light effect in, they should have thought up something with the urim and thumim.To me it's pure paganism. Although you don't see her literally worshiping the thing, she does often grasp it when afraid. An idol, no matter how small is still an idol. I would recommend the ""Bible Series"" version of Esther, which is very good.I give it one star because at least there aren't lengthy love scenes. Some ""bible"" movies like to stretch the amount of human flesh shown to the uttermost limit. This one is moderate in that aspect."
4,An accurate account of this film,"Before I saw this movie in theatres I didn't know what to expect.By the end I was pleasantly surprised by the big effort and obviously big budget devoted to this story. The Bible story of Esther leaves out some small details that, of coarse, when made into a motion picture, must be filled in. But none of the added details can be decidedly unBiblical, since we don't really know about those details in the first place.It does, however, add some interesting details to the story line that I doubt happened in real life, so it is a somewhat fictional account of the literal story. It's a movie!The film is cheesy and overdramatic at parts, but those parts are worth overlooking to see the main point of this story play out.In my opinion, it's totally worth ignoring the menial faults to see God's limitless power and faithfulness (on behalf of those who will trust Him) portrayed!A fine movie."
2,Really wanted to like this movie,"I really wanted to like this film. I love the biblical story and had looked forward sharing this film with my catechism class. Unfortunately, I am not going to show it in class because it's not a good film.The beginning is very confusing even if you've read the Bible. The dialogue is weak (why do they choose English accents for so many of the characters?). I was looking forward to more focus on the great feast Esther prepares for Xerxes following the period of fasting, but was dissapointed. There's a climatic scene with Esther running to the king, but the ending seems anti-climatic afterward.I wanted to root for this movie because I know the Bible has a rich treasure trove of dramatic stories to be enjoyed by everyone. This one unfortunately missed the mark."
2,One Night with the King,"I read the book which followed quite closely with the story in the book of Esther in the Bible, however, the movie was a great disappointment. There was a lot that wasn't made clear and many liberties with the story which were not along with the story. Very disappointing."
3,One Night With The King,"I enjoyed this movie although, as others have already pointed out, it does take a few ""liberties"" with the story of Esther. However, it seems to show the atmosphere of intrigue, mistrust, hatred and even love which must exist in any place of power and the acting is reasonable. Having said this I feel it could have been better if the producer and director had had a little more faith in the original story of Esther which doesn't need any ""improvements""."
2,Disappointing compared to the book...,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I should have known from the instant it was pronounced ""good for the whole family"" that it wouldn't be a filtered and weak version of the book. The book was amazing. I really enjoyed it because it went above and beyond the normal story of Queen Ester. The movie cut out half the book and took out all the violence in an effort to make yet another movie full of good, clean family fun.However, the costumes and the acting were very good. They should have had more of Peter O'Toole, though. This movie definitely had great potential, especially with Sharif and O'Toole part of the cast. However, by taking out half the book and editing it for content, we loose a lot of the story, and this movie just becomes one of the many Queen Ester movies."
2,One Night With the King,"If your looking to get the true story of Esther, look to the Bible not in this movie. Although the acting and filming were done well, the movie just took too much liberty with the story. I guess nothing can compare with the real thing! Watch the movie, but be sure and read the Biblical account first."
4,The story of Queen Esther,Impressive movie based on the Bible story is accurate and visually stunning. The computer recreation of the Persian palace was fascinating.
3,One Night with the King,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday (26yrs) and she has this to say. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Those looking for an accurate portrayal of scripture will be disappointed, however, this film never claimed to be that. I thought the acting, costumes, scenery and sets were all very good. (Sometimes I struggled to make out what was being said - but I look forward to watching it again). I would recommend this to anyone looking to pass a rainy afternoon with a tub of chocolate ice-cream. 8 of 10. Well done all involved."
2,Real Time management gets overwhelming,"The Battlechest is pretty good. You get both WarCraft3 and its expansion (the Frozen Throne) and 4 manuals: a base manual for each game (although the base manual for the expansion is tiny), and a quest manual for each game.I think I would have loved this game had it been turnbased. But it is real time, and managing a group of warriors here, your workers there, your buildings somewhere else, another group of warriors in another place again all in real time is a huge toll on me. Ok, there are hot keys (to switch among groups of units) that make your life easier, but it is still boring to have to care for so many things at once.I stopped playing this game very soon."
5,BEST GAME EVA!!!,"This game has got to be the best war game i have ever played. It has the best online features and awesome gameplay and graphics. It is fun fun fun fun fun fun fun!!!! I CAN'T GET ENOUGH WARCRAFT!!!!!!!! IT RULES!!! There are 4 races, Human, Night Elf, Orcs and Undead (my favorite). THEY ALL RULE...It is very strategic and fun fun fun to play. I suggest you BUY, I mean I WILL MAKE YOU BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Listed for the wrong platform,Although this game is listed to work as a Mac game it does not. It is not a Mac game. I had to return the disks because my computer could not read them. It is wrongly listed at AMAZON.I run Mac OS X 10.6.6. With this OS discs could not be even read out. The OS system could not even recognise the format of the disks. It just ejected them after 3 minutes of spinning. Checking disks up with a computer that has Fedora 14 installed showed that the only executable file on the disc was *.exe which is typical for the Windows platform. There were no executable files typical for Mac OS.
4,No documentation,"There were no instructions with this game. No Quick reference card, no game manual, just the disks. If you do not have the first game, Baldur's Gate you may have a hard time playing this one."
3,Definitely Circa 2001,"I'm new to the game but am pretty disappointed by the graphics and interface. This game was probably ahead of its time in 2001, but it pales next to more recent games such as Neverwinter Nights. The story line seems interesting enough that I'll play it a while longer longer and give it chance."
5,beautiful album!,"I listen to my local soundscape cable TV channel a lot. One day, I heard this incredible voice on a piece of music that was playing. I did some research and purchased the album. When I received the album and played it I could only wonder that the entire album was BETTER than the piece I heard on cable TV! Beautifully done!"
2,Deception,"It is not the show I was looking for. My mistake, however, it is NOT very clear. Ergo, a big deception once I played the DVD at home expecting the show..... Still have not found a DVD with the show itself. Anybody ??"
1,Not what I expected.,"Disappointed I thought this a DVD of his Comedy, but instead it is full of interviews. Not what I expected."
3,I thought this was one of his routines and I was disappointed!,"This is a tribute to Richard Pryor, NOT a comedy routine. I wouldn't have purchased it if I'd known that. It wasn't horrible, but I was disappointed nevertheless. I want some of Richard Pryor's actual taped routines on DVD. Guess I didn't pay enough attention when I bought this.C. R. Oklahoma"
4,The Great One,Very nice tribute. need to do a beeter job of packaging and handling your dvd movies this is the case for all the dvds i've bought from you guys so far.
4,A pleasant surprise,I really liked this effort by an old favorite. It's more of a pop sound than blues but I found it refreshing after listening to the same old stuff. His unique vocal sound is outstanding just like in the old days. It would be nice to see his other solo albums released on CD.
1,One good song and a lot of s**t,"For a whole decade, Nazareth had the Midas touch. But something very strange happened as the 1980's began, and gold turned to dirt with a few exceptions. I just don't get it! How can a band that gave us so many unforgettable tunes end up in this mess? ""No jive"" includes only one good song and that's ""Every time it rains"". Although that one is very good, the rest of the songs are just bad and clearly below average. If you want a dose of the great Nazareth you should invest in the albums between the years 1973-1977, which are:Razamanaz (1973)Rampant (1974)Loud `n' proud (1974)Hair of the dog (1975)Play `n' the game (1976)Close enough for rock `n' roll (1976)Expect no mercy (1977)Start with the masterpiece ""Expect no mercy"" because that is Nazareth's proudest moment. And even `tho the band were uneven and sometimes horrible throughout the 1980's and parts of the 1990's, they managed to record a strong album in 1998 titled ""Boogaloo""."
4,"buy it for ""The Big Parade""","Many good tracks, but ""The Big Parade"" always brings a tear; worth buying for this alone."
4,The slowest parde you've ever seen.,"""The Big Parade"" is worth the price of this album, alone. It is by far the best song on this album but it gets little attention. This is not a bad album, not their best. However, ""The Big Parade"" IS one of the best Maniacs tunes. It is so tragic and haunting. Natalie's vocals will bring you to tears. What an excellent piece about the war in Vietnam."
3,I preferred Rough Guide over older Lonely Planet Guide,"While I have not purchased or used this guide, I did use the older Lonely Planet guide for Rajasthan, Delhi, and Agra published in 2005 as well as the Rough Guide for the same region. I definitely preferred the Rough Guide. I've searched inside the new Lonely Planet guide on Amazon and see that it might have some more color and pictures than the old book, but it generally seems similar. For instance, the new book has less than 2 pages about Fatehpur Sikri while the Rough Guide has 8. So, I would recommend the Rough Guide book instead."
5,"Episcopal Choristers who love to laugh, read this book!","Anyone who's familiar with Episcopal liturgy will laugh at loud at this book...particularly choristers with a sense of humor. If your choir is as much fun as mine, you'll love to share passages of the book with others who rewrite hymn lyrics for jollies or get a chuckle out of the stereotypical ""stiffness"" of the church and its rituals. The Baritone Wore Tweed is a laugh a minute...and a good mystery, to boot! Enjoy!"
5,Not to be missed...,"...but not for the faint of soul. Angela Hunt wraps an eternal truth with an intriguing story and exquisite writing. You'll read Uncharted quickly and mull it over for a long, long time."
4,Met my expectations,"In comparison to its four predecessors, Trance Party Vol.5 is simply good but not great. I have noticed that there is a larger presence of female vocalists in this compilation which does add an effeminate popish taste to it. But the melodies are very enjoyable and the transitions blend the tracks very well. In my perspective, I was a big fan of the previous Trance Party Volumes (especially vol.2) and this volume did not harm the series in anyway. However, don't expect to draw new people into the genre of trance with this CD, pick up Vol.2 for that."
3,One Great Album....But,"This is one of Motley's greatest albums. Listen to these rocking songs, Dr.Feelgood, Kickstart My Heart, S.O.S., She Goes Down and Rattlesnake shake. All foot stompin, fist raised rockin songs. BUT! The Ballads.... I'm sorry but I find them lame. Hey I know people say rock ballads are lame, but I love a good rock ballad. Motley just sounds like, ""well we need a ballad...that'll work"" I find them to be what holds this album back from being their best work."
1,Motley FOOOOLZ,"Another useless record by a bunch of talentless fools who have been ripping off the teenagers for years. If these guys were asked to make some good music or die, they all would have died years ago."
4,Are men really sensitive enough to notice??,"OK, so who knows if this stuff will really attract the guys in flocks. And I'm an old married lady anyway, so it doesn't matter for me. The bottle has a roll on applicator rather than a spray top. I'm not sure how I feel about that yet, seems like they might be more likely to get gunked up. The scent is light and could even be coupled with your regular perfume without being too much. Overall, I'd liken it to wearing food related scents, if you smell good enough to eat, hopefully you'll get somebody to nibble on you;)~"
2,Good Idea if yours works,"Bought this one because it had nice features. When I tried to grind, it bounced around and the top became unlocked. Even holding it closed the button wouldn't stay down and grind the full cycle."
2,Cheap,This grinder has a design flaw. To activate it the 'on' switch is activated in a small crevice. Once the crevice gets gunked up with the coffee dust it stops working. For simplicity and good grinding go with the Braun.Adequate grinder but plan on replacing it within 1 year.
3,started strong,"this gets used 1 or 2 times every day. It started out working great. I have now had it for 6 months and it started stopping before it was done grinding the coffee beans. it is no longer ""hands free"" as I have to hold the lid so it can grind the beans with out stopping. I am just waiting for it to crap out all the way. I checked the warranty and it has expired ,of course."
4,"Saw one, had to have one","I was staying at my daughters and she ""introduced"" me to this new (to me) method of making coffee. I had never bought whole coffee beans in my life. After using hers for a couple weeks, I had to have one. She got me one for Christmas and I am using it every day and loving it. Still trying to get the measurements to my liking. So nice to have robust coffee instead of strained water. Couldn't be easier to use."
4,Works well for spices,"I got this exclusively for grinding spices, and it works quite well. So far the only time I was disappointed was when it didn't grind up a dried chili pepper very well, but perhaps I didn't grind it long enough.I got this over a similarly priced grinder from another manufacturer because I like the idea of being able to remove and rise out the blade/grinding chamber. The cord storage is also nice."
4,grinds cofee while you do other things,I have had 2 other Hamilton Beach coffee grinders and they worked well but didn't hold up well. So far this one does the job well and has held up . I have only had the product for 2 months though. Takes a while to get used to how the cord is put away.
2,Not reliable,"I bought this about 2months ago and was very pleased with the outlook and the fancy functions. I worked fine for a while and now it's hard to get the same quality of grinding. I can see more chunks of coffee beans when it's finished grinding and it seems that the problem is getting worse.My neighbor has a less than $10 worth grinder (looks very cheap, no fancy button,etc.) and it works much better than this one! I'm so disappointed."
2,Not for the long-haul,"I purchased this item about 6 months ago. My husband and I drink about 10 cups of strong coffee per day, so it gets daily, consistent use. About 2 months ago the top started jiggling loose during grinding. I have to hold the top in place...so much for the ""hands-free"" feature. Now, it doesn't grind the beans consistently or thoroughly. Coffee dust will be packed into the bottom of the container and the top will still have partially whole beans. I have tried grinding in two batches w/o any success.My previous coffee grinder was a cheap Krups which lasted about 10 years and finally wore out. I wish I'd stuck w/ a Krups."
1,Works well for 2 months,"I bought this as a replacement for my older Hamilton Beach coffee grinder which died after a year. This one was worse, as the blade fell off after only 2 months, and we haven't been able to screw it back on. Waste of money; put in a few extra dollars and get a more reliable coffee grinder."
4,works well,"Just received the grinder yesterday and already used it. Im using it to grind beans for my coffee press, so far so good. I love the design of the retractable bottom that hides the excess wire that you dont need for the plug that goes to to the outlet."
2,Nice while it works,"I've owned three of these. They're cheap so I just replaced it with a new one. It works well when it works. I find I have to set the grind up to espresso to get it fine enough for drip coffee. If I want espresso grind, I just have to run it through twice. No biggie. BUT, this is the third one of mine that has gone out. The first two had a little plastic piece on them that chipped and then it would no longer work. This last one just quit working this morning and I have no idea why. I've had it less than a year, maybe 6 months. All of the ones that I have owned have lasted less than a year. Right now I am searching for a new grinder for a little more money that will last longer. I will update with what I purchase."
3,"Worked Well, But I Broke It","I was pretty happy with this grinder. It worked well and wasn't too difficult to clean. I liked how I could set it, push the button, and walk away. Grounds tended to stick to the top and in the crevices between the stainless steel and plastic parts, but overall it did its job. Unfortunately, I was only able to use it for about 10 months before it quit on me, which was frustrating, but then I was trying to grind star anise when it died, so maybe that was my fault?"
2,Uneven grind / minimum cups to grind is 4,"This is my first grinder since I became a coffee drinker. I bought it because it met 5 of my criterias:1) Affordable price;2) Hidden cord3) Grind size is selectable4) Removable grind chamber5) Small footprint.One criteria it doesn't meet, however, which is also the MOST important criteria, is that the grind size is uneven.That is a HUGE problem because for someone whose needs a coarse grind for french press, I always get powdery grind mixed with coarse grind AND whole ungrind coffee bean. The result is a lot of sediment in my coffee after brewing.The other problem is it grind 4 cups minimum. I only need to grind about 1-2 cups of coffee at a time.Grind size can be more consistent if the beans are grind longer. In short, this grinder is only good if you need a fine grind. I think this is a consistent problem for all blade grinders.I am getting a burr grinder to replace this."
1,Died an early death... too young!,"I used this coffee grinder for no more than two weeks and it conked out on me mid grind and just died. There was no fluttering of the lids, just gone. We could ask why, but the coffee gods won't listen. I am just without coffee now!"
1,Stopped Working Within 2 months,"It worked fine the first month I had it.But then the locking mechanism started acting faulty. I would have to twist the lid on and off and on and off because no matter what, the thing would somehow not latch properly. Usually after working with it for a few minutes I could get it to latch properly and then away it would grind.But it just kept getting worse and worse until no matter how hard I tried, or how careful I was to turn the lid all the way, and no matter how certain I was that the lid had latched properly, it wouldn't work.So now it's in the trash where it belongs.What a waste of money. Gosh, I guess it's unreasonable for me to expect that it would last a year... maybe even two years. Or *gasp* maybe even 10+ years which is how long electronics would last back in the days they were made well."
1,Mine Broke Too,"Used it for flax only; lasted about a month. Dead. No warning, no strange sounds. It worked one morning and the next it didn't.It is truly galling to buy, and then have to chuck into a landfill, an item like this.Going back to Braun. Or maybe a non-electric mill or grinder."
4,patience makes perfect,"This is the first PC game I've bought for myself, usually I buy kiddie-level games for my 5-year old. Being an avid Tolkien fan, I thought it would be fun to try. In a word, I really enjoy this game a lot. It has a good mix of hack and slash plus puzzle-solving. But, let me warn you, there are times you have to die many dozens of times before figuring out how to get through, around, or just plain run away from some baddie. My daughter has watched me play and gets frustrated at me for dying so much, but I think it's a good lesson for her in patience when she sees me eventually figure it out."
1,Missized,"I received these yesterday and was so anxious to used them, I immediately put them on only to find out they were way too big. I fit into a XXL still pretty comfortably and these were way too big.They are also very short, so if you think they are going to cover your midsection, they will not and they do not go down all the way to your knees..not even close."
5,Aram of the Two Rivers,"This CD is yet another example of Jonas Hellborg's musical mastery. It has quite a different mood and pace from Hellborg's other works, but it is as complex and as beautiful as Hellborg's fans are accustomed to hearing. Accompanied by some of Syria's greatest musicians, this is a Hellborg CD not to be missed."
5,Love it,"Other than ""The Toy Job"" episode seeming slightly out of lip-sync I've been very pleased with my Leverage viewing experience."
4,Good show.,"This show is pure television entertainment. The characters are fun to watch, and the stories are lighthearted and entertaining. I recommend watching this show!"
5,Leverage,"This show it's absolutely amazing, entertaining, clever, and should never have been canceled. There is no other show /series with such a talented ensemble of characters."
3,Charm languishing in Season 5,"The first seasons of Leverage were wonderful. I've always enjoyed con movies with the twist at the end and the focused recap of hidden details leading up to it. The early seasons offered this in spades and it was a novel experience. I feel like it has lost its charm as the seasons have progressed and now it is making fun of itself. It is still good enough to watch when it comes out on Amazon Prime Free Streaming or Netflix, but I won't be paying per episode."
2,Review of The Sinner Madeline Hunter,"The other books in this series were OK. I found this book too slow paced to stay interested for long. It was very easy to put the book aside in favor of other books. I think the reason Fleur Monley desired the 'white marriage' was a weak excuse considering the extent of her fear. When her reason was revealed I thought,""That's all?"" As for Dante, I didn't care for him much. He seemed too juvenile to me. He was very irresponsible. While this book isn't awful, the others in the series are better. The only real reason I can see to read this book is that the reader would want to finish up the entire series, not leaving a book unread."
3,Top 500 Poems,"The Top 500 PoemsMore historical poems than last century poets. Many well-known poets. I was hoping it was similar to a poety book my Dad had that I enjoyed growing up, but it wasn't. Still, I spend quiet time reading to my dogs before bed and having some good quiet time."
2,somewhat disappointed,"Although I checked to see what songs would be in this 3 cd box set before ordering it, I was disappointed none the less to realize that some songs were not as I thought they'd be. I find I listen and enjoy approximately one third of what's on the cd's rather than the majority of the songs. My time is spent skipping over more than half of the tracks to get to a song I really do like. Some of these songs are not all disco either, but I want to make it clear that I listen to and appreciate all kinds of music. For the amount of money spent on this box set, I would have liked there to have been more songs that I would have been interested in."
5,"Good product, excellent service",The items arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. The product was as advertised and were perfect for their purpose. Excellent service.
3,Under 3 only,My son received this book as a gift and I was disappointed in the reading level. The story is not involved enough to hold my 3 year old's attention. In my opinion it is more suitable for children under 3.
5,Flashing Fire Engines~Cute Book!,I ordered this book for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it! Very cute book! Pictures are very detailed with soft- looking animal characters. The wording in this book is very suitable for children ages 2 to 5. This book would make a nice addition to any child's library!
1,hate this product,"I didn't buy this product from amazon, but when I first bought it from target, it worked horribly. It left my hair feeling brittle and dry ( I have relaxed 4b/4c hair) Hated this product, no matter how little or small I used I just hated it. I ended up giving it to my friend. However, she said it worked great for her"
5,Smells great!,I purchased this product along with a new (hot tools) curling iron. I use it on my towel dried hair before I blow dry and then again before I use my curling iron to limit heat damage. It never feels heavy or greasy no matter how much I put in my hair. It makes my hair shiny and it really helps hold my curls. My husband and kids love how it makes my hair smell too!
3,It's ok,"It's ok, nothing super special. Makes hair a bit shiny but that's all I see different. I should've bought it at a local store instead of paying shipping for it thru Amazon, not eligible for prime."
3,So far it's ok,I've only had the product for a week or two and I haven't used it everyday. I haven't noticed a difference in my hair but hopefully it's being protected from the heat! Smells pretty good too!
2,No battery back up and difficult to read.,"We bought two of these for the atomic clock feature. This works well, by the product has some very frustrating aspects.There are three light levels for the digital readout. The brightest two are too bright to sleep by. The dimmest cannot be seen in the daylight at all.Most frustrating is that there is no battery back up. With any power failure, the time resets with the atomic feature, but the rest must be completely reprogrammed - station presets, alams, brightness, etc. Very annoying!"
1,not so good,"This clock is being returned. The time display is virtually unreadable. You CANNOT read the time if you are laying in bed and the clock is above you. Plus, the auto time set absolutely does not work. Finally, no battery back up.For $50 this is a total waste of money. Sony should know better."
1,Poor reception,I'm afraid that the radio reception of this item tells you where it should be placed no matter how you hang the antenna. I know where I'd like my alarm to be but I don't want to have a big antenna on the wall just to keep the correct time. I returned it.
1,the time is green,"Very unhappy's review is on target. Looking directly at the clock, the display is essentially unreadable, enough to be considered defective. This is because the numbers are washed out by the green backlighting.Even had that not been the case, the display characters are so small, anyone who is near-sighted would need to keep this on the bed itself to read it.It's a bummer because it's the only clock radio I know of the displays both the time and dual alarms simultaneously."
2,Good but lacking,"I like the atomic clock feature, but I have had problems with the clock syncing-up. It can have a hard time receiving the signal and can take an hour or more to finally acquire one. I've also had the clock mysteriously reset to a different time zone, although I am squarely in the middle of the east coast time zone. Also, if the power goes out and comes back on, the clock may or may not reset itself and acquire the current time. And there is no battery back-up option. This has made me late for work a few times. On very important days, I need to set a second alarm ""just in case"". One last annoying feature is the backlight. To comfortably see the time, which is in black digits, you have to use the bright setting, which puts out a lot of light and can keep me awake. It would have been better to have lighted numbers on a dark screen rather than black numbers and a bright backlight."
1,Not the Usual Sony product,"I've had this Sony radio for a couple years and am not happy with it at all. I always purchase Sony products and have been very happy with everything I've bought. But this one seems to be very cheap. I already have trouble with the tuning knob that doesn't work right. The atomic clock feature does not work very well and often has to be reset. That could be a problem with the location I suppose, but I'd still never get another one with that feature."
2,"Fine in Principle, Faulty in Execution","How and why the Grail translation of the Psalms found its way into the prayer of the Church disconcerts me. The rendering of Psalm 110 (Psalm 109 in the Douay-Rheims Bible), for example, is grievious. Striking at the heart of the Church's prayer (i.e., the Psalms) strikes at the heart of the Church's belief. The insipid ""modernization"" of the Glory Be and other traditional prayers has me scratching my head, too: who takes it upon themselves to even do this, then publish it and disseminate it among the faithful, anyway?I eventually gave up on this volume, out of frustration, and began praying the Psalms with the Douay-Rheims Bible and the Latin Vulgate, learning a little Latin as I went on. God willing, I would soon like to get the Latin Breviary.In addition, due to similar dissatisfaction with ICEL's treatment of the liturgical texts, I've purchased the 1962 Missal and begun to attend the Tridentine Mass--thanks be to God!"
5,Changed my prayer life,"When I began to pray the LOH (morning & evening prayer) I began to realized what prayer was intended to be - Praise and Worship. The exposure to the Psalms, Canticles and scripture readings have helped make made God present in my life. Even when I pray alone there is comfort knowing that the rest of the church is also praying the same prayers. The LOH also helped me to experience church in a broader sense - (brothers and sisters in Christ). It has transormed my prayer life. I went from a laundry list of wants (me) and now focus on Him and my brothers and sisters. It takes a few times to get the format down, however it is well worth the effort. I HIGHLY recommend praying the LOH if you are searching for deeper waters."
4,"Master P is a wonderful actor. The movie foolish, The Shit.","The review of this movie is a very good movie and the actors that was in the movie made the movie. The movie that just came out Foolish was the best ever. Every movie that Master P makes keep getting better, pretty soon there going to be rolling out the red carpet."
2,This is the Best They Could Assemble?,"I read the first tale FRUITING BODIES by Brian Lumley and thought ""that was pretty good, but I hope it isn't the best tale in the book"". Unfortunately it was... There are a few other good ones like FOET by F. Paul Wilson, but there is also absolute rubbish like TURBO-SATAN by Christopher Fowler. Two other hidden gems were WAKE-UP CALL by David J. Schow and AMONG THE WOLVES by David Case. I advise anyone reading this to skip this book and instead buy any complete works by any of the authors praised above."
3,Kind of Amazing,"Being a Patrick Swayze fan, I purchased this video to check out his vignette. All of the stories in this video are interesting and well acted, but I wouldn't place the movie on my list of all time favorites."
3,Disappointing sound quality,"While highly recommended by The Gramophone, I found the sound quality on this recording to be disappointing. It feels as though the performers are playing behind a curtain. Much of he string playing seems to be softened by an enveloping fog."
1,Oh what a tangle . .,"I used to love all the different books written by this author, whether she was writing as Amanda Quick, Jayne Anne Krentz or Jayne Castle. Now they are all so dull - almost over-detailed. This book is no different. While the premis of ""para-psychology"" could have been interesting the language developed by the author to describe the different types of psychics is confusing and over-used. I found myself skipping huge chunks of this book just to get to the point of the conversation. Don't waste your money -borrow it if you are a die hard fan or wait for it at the local library. I only gave it one star because her heros are usually the strong, silent type - a personal favorite of mine!"
3,Decent,I like it a lot. I also like to think about being a bartender at times. i would love to serve drinks to people and stand on a bar.
3,OK soundtrack for a Fantastic movie!!!,"the song that you are looking for is ""shelter of your love"" by jimmy cliff. this soundtrack is pretty good, but it leaves out some of the better songs such as the one mentioned before and ""this magic moment"" by leroy gibbons."
1,"Ok, too electronic, is good if you are a begginer","This is a nice CD. Too repetitive in some songs arrangements, what makes it a little boring at the beggining. It's for me, like a wine that is too young and alcoholic to drink, and this makes it not enjoyable."
3,"If you're looking to ""buy American,"" don't buy this!",Naturewood pieces are made in China and Thailand.
5,Good Investment,"I am completely thrilled with this stoneware because it is beautiful enough for special occasions and sturdy enough for everyday. No more having ""good"" dishes and ""everyday"" dishes. This one set will serve both purposes."
2,Made in China,"Very disappointed. We have owned 13 place settings for many years. The original set was made in the USA(stamped on the bottom of each piece.) We have also been very happy with the quality. The pieces recently purchased appear to be cheap Knock Offs, made in china also stamped on the bottom. I find it hard to believe Pfaltzgraff would allow this through quality control. Plates don't set flat, when like pieces are stacked, the flaws are very obvious. If you think this a great deal, think again. You get what you pay for."
2,Not bad,The book wasn't bad it just wasn't good. There was too much inner conversations going with the H & H. I would've like to have read more conversation and more action between them.
4,friends to lovers,"Car-mechanic heroine has been friends with attractive Marine Hero for 2 yrs. She sets out to seduce him into losing a no-sex-for-90-days bet with his brothers as payback for him telling her he never thinks of her as a woman. It works so well that Hero can't get her out of his mind & loses the bet happily but tells her they're still just friends after their 1 night of sex. However, his plan backfires on him & heroine wants to make sure she's loved for who she is & not her seductive persona.This was a cute romance. Child's writing pulled me in to care for the characters & a good ending for them. I liked the heroine's strong & independent personality mixed in with some emotional vulnerability. Hero was also likeable. Although he was a playboy, he didn't act like a jerk or played games. He had a good sense of humour & got right to the point. Sexual chemistry was good. Love scenes were ok.Recommended."
3,"nice, but a bit heavy",I really liked the oil free much better because it didn't create such a heavy layer on my face. This is heavy enough to weigh down the delicate skin underneath my eyes which doesn't look good unless carefully applied. The oil free felt much nicer and looked better.
4,Great resource,"I have used this book and found it to be a great concise resource. It's a good ""how-to"" book, suggestions then many examples. One can tell that Asher writes from great knowledge and experience."
2,A lot of the same thing,"I was not exactly thrilled with this book. It seems that the author mearly published all of the resumes he has written for clients rather than show some different forms and styles. Granted, there are many ideas to be gotten out of the book, but I would have liked to see some variety in the styles of the resumes. They all looked much the same. I think ""Executive Resumes"" by Steven Provenzano has been a much more helpful resume book"
3,"Ummm, yeah.","After the reviews and description I was expecting a decent mystery type with innovative plot twists. If that's what you want try Death Note. I was expecting edge-of-your-seat suspense. I found myself browsing catalogs while it played instead. There were no real unpredictable surprises here, and the story line was kind of mediocre. The only really interesting parts, who are the Blade Children and who are the Hunters are never even answered. Quite a bit is left unanswered. In some stories that's a good thing to enhance the mystery, here it detracts as the writing isn't up there. In fairness, I have not watched the subtitled version. Assuming there is one. Package listed extras and I never saw a menu to access them. Didn't look real hard though. Maybe in a year or two I'll go back and find it better, once the expectations are forgotten. Then again, maybe not."
5,AWESOME!,"I have this CD since 1990 and had forgotton about it for quite some time. I recently updated my stereo equipments and came across this CD when cataloging my collections so I popped it in the CD play, oh my, I feel so sorry to let it sit on the shelf for so long!It is absolutely beautiful! Every song is exciting, romantic and beautifully done! The recording is also amazing! I don't own any other Gipsy Kings CD but I sincerely doubt they can even top this one.This CD is a ""must have"" for music lover and audiophiles, I am so glad that I have it!"
3,Good but SO NOISY!,"The card delivers what it promises: it is fast, really helps games like FS2004, and runs perfectly.However, if you are not a fan of jet engine noise levels, you will need to change the cooling of the card. It is quite impressive to see the amount of decibels produced by such a small fan...did BFG run out of cash when they made that cooling?Add $30 and get a Zalman or Thermaltake GPU fan, and the card becomes really perfect...and cooler!"
5,Great product,"Very easy and super fast set up. Instructions are simple and concise. I installed it for an older Toshiba desktop (Celeron 466 MHZ), under W98SE, and it works flawlessly. It sits in a bedroom behind 2 closed doors and 3 walls with 2 large storage closets, and gets a strong signal (over 95%) from DI-713P, which is set up as an access point (infrastructure) with 802.11b. It probably would be even faster with another Airplus 22Mbps product. No configuration needed, and truly PnP and running in about 5 minutes. It supports 64/128/256-bit WEP, and carries a 3 years warranty. The price, with the current rebate, makes it an even greater value. What more can I say about D-Link that I have not said before!"
2,"Giving You The Best That I Got...Well, That's Not Enough!","Some of the songs on this CD sound okay, but just okay. I personally believe that her last CD sounds better than this one. I know that she's not all that great of a singer, but I enjoy the type of music that she sings. I hope this isn't the best that she's got!"
3,A little disappointed.,"Sorry, I read just too many biz books to give this 5 stars. It does have one theme which is profound, as described by others above. So I will just say that, besides that, it seems to be a jumbled mess of miscellaneous content from elsewhere woven through and through with the same ""just do it, win, win, win"" and ""go for it, win, don't lose"". The content is not original and hardly gives the reader one lick of ideas for executing anything. The football and beer commercial references get old fast and after several chapters I began to wonder if these guys ever built a business from the ground up, or did they just go rah rah rah for someone else. Lots of hindsight ... so what."
5,I Was There! Rare...,"These guys headlined (closed) the show. Nobody knew who they were, just a bunch of session guys from California. My high school buddies and I were there all day and enjoyed all of the heavy, well-known talent. Then, from start to finish, these guys just kicked-butt. Perfect band at a perfect time and enjoyed them very much. Put it in your car, turn it up, and enjoy the ride...it's a real upper."
3,The Affectionate Adversary,"I enjoyed The Bachelor's Dilema by Catherine Palmer, but I found this book to be tedious and repetious. The heroine's constant fixation that only people who were destitute could enter Heaven was annoying and not entirely biblical."
4,Enjoyable Romance,"I actually think this might be the nicest of the Regency period romances that I have read. I grow weary reading of a perfect woman falling for a perfect man. I rather enjoyed seeing the very warped attitudes of Sarah and her sisters. I liked the Jane Austen type of writing where the attitudes of both Sarah and Charles were evolving and changed by all God allowed into their lives. I was pleased that Sarah loved her quirky sisters without trying to change them. This was a free kindle book but it will cause me to purchase the other two in this series. So free was a wise move for this author. I liked the humor that was there. I liked the surprises in the story and I thought the ending was just right. I appreciated the author's inclusion of insight into the pitfalls of wealth Well done Catherine Palmer.Barbara Anne Waite- author of memoir: ""Elsie- Adventures of an Arizona Teacher 1913-1916"""
1,Who's responsible for this...thing?,"This is bad. This is so bad. My friend listened to it and became physically ill. The synthesizer music is cheesy. Javert's and Valjean's voices are too high, while Marius's is too low. The singers, though on-tune, not only have no emotion whatsoever, but also sing choppily, with over-precise rhythms that make them sound like music machines. And to top it off, when they feel that a song isn't long enough, they'll repeat the last few verses. Hello. We want to hear *less* of your voices, not *more.*Don't buy this even if they offer to pay you. No, wait: buy it, take the money, then stake the CD and bury it at a crossroads."
1,No!,"I listened to clips from this- and I wish I could have seen my face reacting. Probably a mixture of disgust and terror! There was no emotion in it at all! There was no Fontine, or Javert- only people singing in the roles, just singing the notes if anyone knows what I mean. I shudder at how they would have done my favorite song, ""On My Own"". And I'm fairly glad it wasn't one of the clips. I would never buy this CD. It is not worth it.The people aren't terrible singers- but they are NOT singers that should sing Les Mis. I didn't think that the instrumental was too bad- but everything just sounded deliberate- it was not at all like it was real. I could name a few casts that DO make it real in case you are wondering. Go try the CD clips from a CD called ""Les Miserables: The Musical That Swept The World (10th Anneversary)"" or something to that effect. That is my very favorite cast- they bring Les Mis to life like no others! They are incredible! But this one: Sorry but it's a no go folks!"
1,This Album deserves to be critisized,"I am a loyal Wu Fan and have almost every Wu CD imaginable, including this one. ""Never Again"" was a great song that got me interested in Remedy. I anticipated his CD and was very let down. Some of the beats are tight, but (overall) this CD IS NOT. I hate to admit that the Wu has fallen out, but this CD (along with Cappadonna's The Yin and the Yang) proves that it indeed has. I will never lose my loyality to Wu...but it has fallen out. Let us find refuge in 36 Chambers."
2,Annoying problems with this sound card.,"Decided to replace this card, due to having to reboot the computer(Windows XP)to load the drivers each time the sound card is used. I gave it a rating of 2 only because it does sound excellent when it's working. It seems to be more trouble than it's worth. Also has the occasional synchronization issue while playing music, where you need to stop and replay the song. There are several forums regarding problems with this card. No help from M-Audio."
2,Should have known what I was getting...,I read all the bad reviews and I also saw reviews with flawless installs. So I tried it and mine was not flawless. I emailed the company's support address with my issues and never received a response. The output worked fine but there seemed to be a part of the driver that would not allow the input of the card to be used by the computer for recording in a DAW. On the monitor you could see the input into the card. I replaced the card in the studio system and everything is working well now. I may try it in a future new build.
5,So exceited to find the large platter!,"I've been looking everywhere for this platter to add to my new stoneware -- and of course, I found it on Amazon. I bought the 4-piece placesetting of Naturewood for 8 and was thrilled to complete my purchase with this platter. Everything arrived quickly and safely. I've recommended Amazon for kithchenware purchases to all of my friends!"
5,Fantastic service,"What a wonderful idea. Because it doesn't get hot at the bottom, you can use this as an insert for a larger patio firepit or fireplace and it looks really nice. I had purchased one, in which we burned paper logs, but with this unit there is instant off and on flames and no clean up. I have lots of ideas of where I can use one of these in my outdoor decorating. AND THE SERVICE WAS WONDERFUL. I had company coming and wanted it before they came. There wasn't any way to add faster delivery and I thought it would not get her until they we almost ready to go home. But it arrived 4 days after I ordered it! I then had a question, called their 800 number, and was greeted by a wonderful woman, who answered my question and was extremely friendly and fun to speak with. When my friends see this, they will have a lot more sales, that's for sure."
1,Eye shades,"For sure a cheap product where you get what you paid. The plugs are just a couple of small sponges which fall off the ears, and the shades work if you don't need to cover all the light in the room but just to dimm it.Would not buy this again, rather spend a little more money and get a better product."
2,This show should have stayed cancelled!,"I used to watch this show, but stopped during the most recent season. During its original run it was funny & unique. When it returned it wasn't as good & just got progressively worse. The show nowadays takes old jokes that worked before & stetches them out in newer episodes to the point where it is no longer funny. Often it looks like they add things just to fill air time (how was that Conway Twitty thing supposed to be funny?). It seems like Seth McFarlane has become so powerful that everyone on his staff is afraid to tell him when something isn't funny (This seems to be the same problem George Lucas had with Star Wars Episodes 1-3). Seth has also gotten greedy by splitting up seasons into 2 DVD sets to make you pay twice as much. I think I'll just go back to watching my Season 1 & 2 box sets!"
3,it's not even the right cover!,"Okay I didn't buy it from Amazon but that's not the point, I saw the pic , saw it was 13.99 an said to myself ""sold!"". well I shouldn't have, when i got it the picture on the actual case didn't match the one on the website and it was in a regular dvd case.( it had a horse and lincoln on the front not the usual family guy picture) no way can three discs be in here. So , i went to Amazon to check out reviews(cause Amazon peeps review the best). So, I found out that Seth Macfarland pretty much went cheapy on the season or volume ...whatever it is and jipped us, the viewers, his meal ticket, with this one. I just wish they would advertise it with the right cover and tell us exactly what i'm buying. thank god it was cheap!"
3,"not as great as the first earlier seasons, but still ....","you gotta own this if you already bought the first 6 seasons! but they are losing the whole funny thing....oh well, on to the next showSeth Mcfarlane..."
2,Overpriced and Under-funny,"Fox continues its practice of releasing 13 episodes for what they used to charge for a full (~24 episodes) volume. It's just not worth it until it goes on discount for around $20.But more importantly, the content of the show has suffered a serious decline in quality. There are far fewer laugh out loud moments, fewer genuinely funny episodes, and fewer plots that are even worth animating. There are several episodes that didn't make me laugh once (and that has never happened in any previous season). I hope this is just a hiccup and not a trend, but I'm losing faith.In short, it's too much money for too few episodes of declining quality."
4,1 CD has bad quality,I am not sure why one of the 3 CDs have bad color quality - as if it is a pirate version... everything else was great.
5,Family Guy: Vol 7 Review,"Brand new high quality condition. Speedy delivery, with plenty of time to spare for the holidays. GREAT black friday price, compared to Best Buy's $50+ price!"
4,Why does the volume number not match the season number?,"Reading some of the reviews and looking at my own collection of FG seasons it makes me wonder why Volume 1 is Season 1 and 2? I have just bought what I thought was Season 8 but looking on amazon, it would seem that I have bought 1/2 of Season 8 and the rest of it, screening now (according to [...]) will be released at a later date.It's frustrating that they don't just release the season at the end of it once they have all been screened - I guess this way they make double their money because people think they're buying the whole season but they're buying half of it because it's considered a ""Volume"" rather than a season (even though the sleeve says ""Season 8""!!)Please make up your mind FG - I really enjoy watching the episodes, unfortunately they're not screening on TV in Oz at the moment (on free to air tv, without HD) so I have to wait.Definitely looking forward to the 2nd Star Wars episode - ""Something, Something, Something Dark Side...."""
4,The usual good stuff from MacFarlane & Co.,"I don't buy the Family Guy DVDs to see episodes for the first time, I buy them to see the episodes over and over again because I enjoy the comedy. If you like Family Guy, you'll enjoy this set.The extras are pretty good. There's a tour of their offices, a mix of commentary (some with and some with MacFarlane), and probably the funniest part - footage of the crew's talk at Comic Con 2008, which reminded me a lot of seeing Family Guy Live in Chicago.I have only one complaint, and it's the same for the last several DVD releases - MacFarlane is screwing us with these half-season packages at a full-season price. Come on, give us an entire season!"
1,"wow, this show is REALLY lame... don't reward its creators by buying","family guy is way overrated. just as the writers of south park so aptly put it, the writers of family guy are freakin lazy and unimaginative. i mean, come on... it's obvious mcfarlane has never put the effort into creating a coherent plot for his episodes. any fool with half a lick of talent can create a cartoon that consists of ""flash backs"" and music numbers strung together with no real purpose or message behind them... not to mention the fact that half of the episodes just copy the plot and characters from other well known shows/movies (e.g., willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the twilight zone, etc.).that said, don't buy this family guy dvd. family guy freakin sucks."
2,Wait for it to go on sale for under $20,"Full season prices for a half season?Not including the Stewie Kills Lois/Lois Kills Stewie episodes and making fans buy a separate release to get these episodes?Wow, talking about buying the hand that feeds you. Didn't DVD sales put this show back on FOX and now the fans get treated like this?Well, not me.If I buy it, they are going to have to put it on the discount rack. I'm not paying full price for this. Sorry, Seth."
2,Hate it,"This book was very disappointing. The colours they speak of are not clear in the pictures. The page talks of one colour, but the Van Gogh painting's colours are sometimes so obscure that my 2.5 year old keeps asking me ""where is X colour""?"
3,Have not made up my mind.,"Personally I love this book. I am a huge Van Gogh fan so this book is perfect for me, however, it is supposed to be made for my son. He is not old enough to enjoy it yet, but I am not sure if he ever will"
3,British point of view thru British beer goggles.,I have a vast experience in Thailand going back 35 years.But I am not a Drunk so I see things thru different eyes.The book is a work of Fiction.
5,Audio caffeine,"This album is simply audio caffeine! If you play this album on your way to work, or while you're getting dressed, you will have no need for any coffee.If you looking for the album that gives you the most notes per dollar, you have found the bargain you seek. If you want to laugh because musicians are playing with such insanity that it's funny, prepare to be highly amused. I have no idea what the original pieces sound like, but it hardly matters. This album is its own thing. They could be playing any tune like this, and it would still be intense and amazing."
1,Not recommended for either Zorn or Coleman fans,"I've got about 30 Zorn albums, but sold this one. As others have said, it's a punk hardcore thrash-jazz take on Ornette Coleman's pieces, at about 200 mph.If it weren't for the incredibly angry drums recorded very high in the mix, it might have worked for me--as is, I get too aurally tired listening to this. Not fun. If you want loud, go for Naked City. Here, there's too much sameness from piece to piece.Listenproof, in my opinion."
1,"Faucet Handle Gets Loose, Some Repair Parts Discontinued","Yes, the faucet looks very nice. But I've had this faucet less than four years and the faucet handle is permanently loose. I would re-tighten the center screw every other day, but the handle continued to get loose. Then I looked up repair parts for my faucet to see if I could permanently fix the problem with new parts, but according to Delta's web site, some of the repair parts have been discontinued. Be careful."
2,Anti-Mormon Drivel masquerading as history,"The book is filled with speculative leaps and assumptions that leave the reader wondering about Vogel's mental and interpretive gymnastics. The author accepts without criticism sources critical of Joseph Smith, yet dismisses sympathetic sources out of hand. This book is basically an attempt to set forth Anti-Mormon arguments and bigotry under the guise of credible history rather than trashy expose like Ed Decker and his ilk."
4,Arcade Machines are Expensive,"And this is what they cost. Those whining about the price: THIS IS WHAT YOU PAY! Used machines are cheaper but for a brand new one, that price is about right. About the machine itself: I dont own one or have played this version but most DDR machines are sturdy and reliable. Especially for a machine that gets pounded on."
1,Poor quality product.,This item had a strong smell and very poor quality. My son could use it for two days only. It was like a joke.
3,Doesn't light up.,Keys too small. Mode buttons don't even light up. Fairly easy to program. Guide and menu keys are in a bad position and tiny.
3,Good value,"This universal remote was overall very easy to program basic commands. I was able to use it within minutes on my TV,Sat.,and BlueRay however I have had no luck with my RCA surround sound receiver. I have tried all of the codes in the book as well as the ""search for codes"" option on the remote itself. There are also several buttons on my Sat remote that the new remote does not have,but I really need to get into the more detailed programming yet. The shape of the remote is not a very sleek design and due to it's size and shape, my husband prefers to use our old remotes. I guess this means that for now, all 5 will stay scattered around the t.v. room."
1,Don't buy this album !,"This album has some really bad ""remixes"". The added vocal-bits don't sound like Kraftwerk's Ralf & Florian at all. The worst tracks are ""Computerlove"" and ""Detaku"" ... !Better buy one of the original albums by Kraftwerk like ""Autobahn"", ""Man Machine"" or ""Electric Cafe"" ! ..."
3,Not as good as expected,"I preordered this in January. My order was for a white dream machine. When it was delivered in late March, it was a silver one.I actually like the look of the silver better than the white, so the mistake was okay with me.It has a soft buzz that is constant when it's turned off. The TV channels don't come in well, so you need to be really close to the TV towers (we're 50 miles from the stations). It was very easy to install. The wireless remote is wonderful, especially with the magnet on the back. The sound of the radio stations is fine. The price was by far the cheapest around and the shipping was free. I'm glad to have it and will enjoy if for years to come."
3,A lot of childrens clothes patterns that I don't need,"I wanted a book with ladys dresses, jackets etc. But it also contains a lot of childrens clothes. Patterns I don't need.The enlargement system (scale) is a pain in the ....After enlarging you have to alter almost averything. I don't blame the auther, it is just the way patterns were drawn in those days."
3,Not bad,"He has talent, but for some reason his C.D's that I have bought do not really impress me the way his fathers do, but tastes do vary, and maybe mine will change if he varies his tunes to Blue Grass or Rocka Billy."
4,I only wish I had been in that club for this taping!!,"Ruben Blades is the consumate artiste...actor, singer/songwriter, politician. This CD absolutely FLAMES, and my only question is...how in the world did they ever keep that club from disintegrating when he finished up with ""Muevete"" (""Move yourself!"" for those who might not catch the political/social reference)?? I make a lot of tapes for friends, and this is one song EVERYONE demands on each tape...sometimes on both sides!"
2,Lacks Anything Original or New,If you've heard his program or read any financial advice books this book is nothing but rehashed material and based on old ideas when the markets were humming along. The advice won't work in the current economic conditions. Worse yet it's boring to read and poorly written. Very disappointing.
1,Still trying to wash the STINK off,"Whew! Unlike the others below, I hadn't seen ""Ghost Watcher One,"" but was unlucky enough to pick this up at the library. I think the only thing that works in this film (looks like it was shot on video) is the sound recording. Directing, acting, cinematography and story are all uniformly bad, along with ridiculous makeup. ""The Dude"" below, is one of the actors in the film as no sane person who would ever see this piece of excrement as anything other than a painfully low talented effort at filmmaking. And what's with the towel over the bedroom door??? Attention Aspiring Filmmakers: you should watch this as inspiration that you don't need an Academy Award winning script to get your movie made. It will make you feel like your Francis Ford Coppola, David Lean and Steven Spielberg all rolled into one. Wish I could write more, but I'm still trying to get rid of the stench this video left."
1,Great but not worth $99,"I love this product and just found out that I can no longer purchase in the stores. However, at the ridiculous price here, I will find another replacement."
5,Best Aftershave I've Used,"I've been using this Aftershave by Anthony Logistics for over two and a half years, and have never found a product that worked so effectively. The best part is that it costs close to as much as the stuff you can buy at a local grocery store (if you buy the Anthony through Amazon), and this product will work three times better.I use other pre and post-shave products from Anthony, such as the glycolic facial cleanser, and even the clay mask, and I've been really pleased with all these products."
5,My husband loves it and swears by Anthony products,"My hubby is normally a cheapo--would never spend the extra dollar on facial products, but he swears by this after-shave (and the facial cleanser and scrub)!We didn't buy online, but thought I would share the product review."
3,candles and absences,"This book represents a special path in the hoodoo-voodoo tradition mixed up with some Wicca and unnecessary informercial propaganda. It has as its companion, the author's book Charms, Spells, & Formulas. In general, it is good. The traditional botanica material on candle burning is very good. It also gives some very interesting correspondences between the odus (referring to the geomancy oracle) and the (Louisiana) Vodou Lwas. The main problem with the book is what is missing. There is a lot that screams for more development. The book has some obvious holes. It is not well written for that reason."
5,to add...,"""Minimum Wage"" is probably the best 30-second song ever. I also really enjoy ""Whistling in the Dark."" ""Now it's Turkish delight, on a moonlight night..."" I know that they didn't write that one, but they did such a great job on it that it has become the most enjoyable song on the album."
3,Apollo 18 was better,"The only really good songs on this CD were ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"" and ""Istanbul (Not Constantinople)"". I also liked ""Dead"", ""Particle Man"" and ""Whistling in the Dark"" to a lesser extent, but the rest of them were pretty uninteresting. Even though ""Birdhouse"" and ""Istanbul"" are the best songs I have heard by TMBG thus far (and it would probably be worth it to buy the CD just to hear those two), I thought Apollo 18 had more better-than-average songs on it than this one. It's really too bad that the good songs are spread out among several CDs. You'll just have to get all of them."
1,Terrible,"They Might be Giants is kind've like Hip-Hop for me. There really isn't any musical talent involved, from the simplistic ""music"" here to the beats there. So, when the music isn't interesting to listen to, you have to have good vocals to listen to. Well, the vocalist is downright annoying and boring, and what he's saying isn't any better. It's nonsense, without any redeeming value. This album really is terrible, and very, very boring."
4,"A great album, but why are there Flood-only-ers?","The first rock music I ever listened to was this very album: Flood. I was young, so what appealed to me was the silliness and fun they could have with sub-pop/rock music. THEY still appeal to me but in a different fashion. This album is terrific and if you like tmbg this is a band-defining album and a must have. But why would ANYONE sit around listening to the same 19 tracks and complaining about everything else TMBG does? I just don't get it. FS and Appolo 18 are definitely better than Flood, FS for its variety and Appolo 18 for its creativity. While I like Flood, it seems to be less stimulating than several of their albums."
5,Best of the live DVDs,"This is Kirk and the boys right around the time ""Grapes of Wrath"" came out. To see these songs live from a very young and vibrant Kirk is amazing. You can get the true feeling of the ""post-punk"" era from the crowd. ALL of Kirk's live DVDs are raw, this one let's you understand the others...understand? Kirk is forever young...like ALL good people."
1,Grizzly plug cutters,"If you're looking for cheap, this is the way to go. They didn't get past the test phase in my shop. I'll keep them though, as a reminder of the non-quality products that Grizzly sells. I cannot believe they stay in business selling tools as such!"
5,Great Workout,I workout in my basement and wanted to vary routine. Bought this book after buying fitness ball. Really only bought it to get to the $25 threshold for free shipping but glad I did. Many well explained exercises with pictures. Also a section for recommended workouts routines. Well worth the money. Doesn't matter male or female (I'm a guy).
4,Depends on Which Band You're Buying This For,"I wanted to give a little more insight into this release. It's a split between The Dirtbombs and King Khan and His Shirnes. I bought this because I love The Dirtbombs. That being said, I was dissapointed in this release from that point of view. I just feel that these Dirtbomb tracks are not as rememberable as their other work. This was my introduction to King Khan and His Shrines though. I really was into what they were doing here so I checked out some of their other stuff. With that being said, I think these are pretty good tracks from The Shrines. From The Dirtbombs though it almost feels like a B-sides collection where they stuck songs they couldn't put anywhere else."
2,Came in broken,"Looked like it would be a nice fire log. But it came in broke, like many others said their did. The packaging is really bad. Then it was out of stock. so I did not reorder."
4,Mecha Godzilla is Mecha Cool!,"I introduced my now 4 year old son to Godzilla a few months ago, and he has become obsessed. There isn't a lot of Godzilla merchandise in circulation at this time, but am very happy to have found this. This toy is great looking, and stands up to the abuse my son dishes out on it as he re-enacts battles scenes with this along with the actual Godzilla toy I bought from the same manufacturer through Amazon."
2,"Cloying taste, not as good as Bear Naked","Since there were many positive reviews, I thought I'd give it a try to see if I like it as much as I loved Bear Naked.Quite disappointed with the taste. Its a little sweet and cloying. While I had success in getting my wife hooked onto granola with Bear Naked, she can't eat more than a little of Udi's and leaves the rest of her bowl in disgust - it just tastes a bit too sweet. I'm a little more tolerant in general, but I think in the taste test, Udi loses by a mile.We're not looking forward to the rest of the sampler pack :( My recommendation to anyone interested in trying this out is to buy a single pack and compare it to Bear Naked.Also, the size is 13oz and not 16oz as mentioned in another review and my shipment did include the Hawaiian and Bananaberry flavor - didn't find them great as well. The only flavor thats good and not too sweet is the Cranberry flavor. I will not buy this again."
2,Navy Seals in Vietnam.,"As if we don't have enough books about Special Forces in Vietnam, here is still another one. Dockery's writings do not have the flow, and this short book takes longer than needed. The reader gets information about some of the missions, equipment, and the Brown Water Navy. The Navy Seals did not contribute as much as the Marines and Army in Vietnam. Still we get another book about Special Forces."
1,NO FUN,Purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren....This is Boring and absolutely NO FUN no matter what your age. I guess for almost $40 you shouldn't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting. Doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it.
2,Book was too marked up.,While the book is in good condition - it does have quite a bit of marks ups in the margins throughout. This was disappointing as the review of this book did not indicate the extent of mark-ups. Needing to use this book for class - I now have to erase notes throughout the book since most of these notes do not match notes I would record.
4,Saw this book at the library,I got this book at the library and had to have it. The book came in record time and it was in much better shape than the one from the library. I have used it yet but think I will make several of the patterns soon.
4,"Can't beat ""Still the One""",It's still one of the best rockabilly sounds ever. Great vocals and dynamite guitar.
3,Post Tropicalia gone off the deep end,"The Tropicalia movement consisted of a group of inconoclasts who took bossa nova and samba, deconstructed them, then put them back together, and in the process indulged in psychedelics, so what came out became a heady mixture of Beatles inflected Brazilian music.Tom Ze, an iconoclast's iconoclast, took things one step further and deconstructed the reconstructed Tropicalia and turned it into....well, Tom Ze....there's just no comparison, since his signature sound is just inimitable.I'd have to agree with the reviewer here who says this is ""not the place to start"" if you're contemplating your first Tom Ze purchase. This CD, which is ostensibly an opera of sorts about the subjugation of women over the centuries, is indisputably his most inaccessible. It's got some highlights, but ""Fabrication Defect"", ""Hips of Tradition"", or ""Jogos de Armar"" are much more catchy and listenable as a whole."
5,Amazing album!,"This is a fantastic album! Sweetly Broken was the reason I bought it, but after listening to the whole album, I'm not even sure it's my favorite anymore. There are so many laid-back praise songs on it. I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a soft male voice singing praises. It's a beautiful album."
5,Lost At Sea,"The two Craig's Brother albums sit at the top of the best albums of all time. Lost at sea stands to be the bands last work but the quality is amazing. The lyrical genius of Jonah Ted Bond shines through, as you have to have some intelligence to merely understand the content. The melodies are unforgettable and the harmonies never cease to amaze me. This is the mellower of the two albums but it cover the entire gamut of emotion and music."
3,Decent Debut,"Most of the other reviews were ""spot"" on. It's a good pop/rock/dance/r&b cd..In my opinion she's like a secular/dirty, dirty version of Stracie Orrico, which is a good thing."
4,UNBELIEVEABLELY GOOD ALBUM!,"This album caught my eye. I just happened upon it and gave it a listen. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very surprised. This album is deffinately something everyone should give a try. Those that don't like this album, probably do not like raw talent. It's not polished pop, it's raw. A lot of people who try, fail. But Kaci pulls it off quite well.It's not just pop, but rock, and everything in between. The balads are beautiful, and the rest are catchy and melodic.This was deffinately a surprise. Music lovers around the world will love this CD. Deffinately do not pass it up just because a few people give this a negative rating. It's a diamond in the ruff."
1,New Girl's Effort Comes Up Short,"I thought this CD would keep me entertained, but obviously I waswrong. This girl sings the most sticky-sweet lyrics, and her voice is somewhat nasally. Please refrain from this album.1. UNBELIEVABLE (9/10)2. INSTIGATOR (1/10)3. CADILLAC HOTEL (1/10)4. BODY LANGUAGE (2/10)5. THE WALTZ (3/10)6. SOS (1/10)7. LIKE 'EM LIKE THAT (9/10)8. MY BABY (1/10)9. YOU FOOL (1/10)10. MAKE YOU LOVE ME (1/10)11. THANK YOU (4/10)"
1,WAY OVER RATED!,"She sounds like a mix between Jessica Simpson & Mandy Moore. She has NOTHING unique about her voice.All she does is moan through her songs & sound nasly. Just because she is able to dance & is a pretty girl, does not constitute as talent."
2,not that bad for a britney clone......,"Ok i really only liked her singe Unbelivable, My Baby, Thank You, and Instigator was OK. The truth is her voice is pretty bad its a lot like Britney's. Sorry but Kaci can't sing"
5,great lyrics and tight cords,"This is a great CD. It was very impressive. Although it is not a amazing ""prima facia"" CD it grows on you alot. As soon as you delve into the CD you appreciate it a lot more. It includes the amazing song ""Do Your Feet Hurt"" and other great punk hits that all talk about ""Life In General""....."
5,THE BEST MXPX CD!,This has to be the best mxpx cd ever. It has a true punk sound to it and it is awesome to skate to. The lyrics are awesome and the guitar is really good. A must-buy for punx!
4,Good Punk Rock,Mxpx shows some growth in this album and it is very good. A must buy for all punk rockers
4,"Two really great songs, but his greatest times were behind him by now","No serious collection of Smokey Robinson music would be complete without the title track from this album and ""Just To See Her,"" which have enough staying power to give this album 4 stars instead of 3, but nothing else on this album even comes close to matching the greatness of those two."
5,A Must Have,"This is a must have for anyone planning on taking the PMP Certification Exam. I took a ten week course in Project Management in preparation for the exam, and would NOT have passed this test on the first try without this book. It is insightful, focuses your study, and really helps you understand the types of questions you can expect on the exam."
1,Not a good product,"Wanted this safe to keep anyone else but me out of it, and to open reliably when I needed it most. It will open for me reliably, but it will also open for ANYONE else. All anyone has to do is just push the button and it opens for anyone.Horrible product for keeping unauthorized entry, although, if all you want this safe to do is open whenever you push the button - it will do just fine.Don't buy into this company's Biometric BS for such an important function in your life.Very disappointed."
1,"Safe Now Opens Itself! Very Dangerous, find something else.","Length:: 1:00 MinsI've had this for about 3 years and just found today that it will ""open itself"" if I induce a little vibration by pushing it along my floor. Shocking and terrifying to say the least."
1,Disappointed After A Year,The idea behind the design is great. Sadly the vault buttons failed after one year. The vault only opens by key now. Thankfully my 1911 was not stuck inside. I'm buying a mechanical lock vault.
2,Disappointed,Purchased this safe and immediately had problems with trying to program. It would not accept the code I wanted to use. It also would not accept the keyto open it. I needed to return it. Disappointed because it was the perfect size I needed.
5,Perfect for protecting my protection,"With all of the crazy mania over firearms, this little safe provides the perfect protection for my boom stick. A must with little ones around the house."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband after reading a good review in a handgun magazine. We were both so disappointed. While it fit his handgun and a clip, one out of every three times it would not open properly. The light would flash green and we could hear it unclick, but it wouldn't pop open. A gun vault needs to open smoothly every single time. Maybe it was just our particular vault that had a quirk, but we returned it and won't be replacing it with the same type vault."
5,UPDATE: NEW ONE GREAT (first one arrived scratched),"first one of these arrived to me scratched. first impressions are very important to me. they were only slight scratches but there nonetheless. i just sent it back.NEW ONE ARRIVED: It's great. works as designed. just the right amount of room for my home protection pistol which will now be ready to go in a jiff. if i go out and decide to leave my carry pistol at home i can put it in there as well they both fit. i love it so far. looped the cable around the bed frame. you would have to break the bed frame or cut the cable to get it. just a deterrent, but no one is going to accidentally get at my guns. buy one."
3,no wimpy ballads here,"Stumbled accross this gem recently. Imagine, if you will, a cross between early RATT, CRUE, & CINDERELLA. Stir it all up, toss out any wussiness and you have ZAN CLAN. With the exception of ""Outro"" a 90 second waste of time that sounds like the theme song to a tv show involving cops and ambulances from the early 80's, this album is is a fist pumping, hair raising rocker. The guitarist, Pontus Norgren (sp) from Talisman and Great King Rat is one of the most unheralded players out there. Driving beats, thumping bass, great vocals and harmonies, this album is not reinventing the hard rock wheel, but it sure adds spokes to it. Take a chance on it."
3,go go go shotgun,"well, good ol zinny j zan is back with a bang, 2nd cd by swedish glamztres led by ex shotgun messiah man, the cd kicks of good, makes a kinda slow turn and losing speed. to be honest, the cd is good buy not great!"
3,forgettable,"Shostakovich's music from the film Alone (1931) suffers from the same shortcomings many film scores suffer - that being inadequate time to fully develop themes and continuity. Few composers seem able to overcome the film format that requires pieces to be short and numerous without becoming either repetetive or forgettable. Success stories that come to mind are Bernard Herrmann and John Williams. Unfortunately, while the playing is strong and nuanced, Shostakovich's score falls into the forgettable category for this reviewer."
4,Fantastic,"In my opinion this is the best Cure album. The writing, music and production are all fantastic and it all seems to come together seamlessly. Most of all, this album has loads of passion and desire so it comes across as very genuine to the listener. It's almost always in my cd player and never seems to get boring. There are no real low points but for me, Pictures of you has to be one the greatest songs of all time. The extended version on the album is soooo much better than the radio mix it's almost a completely different song.To sum it up, it's a great listen for Cure and non Cure fans alike."
5,Sheer Power and Melancholy,"This is the album of sheer power and melancholy. The standout track is Disintegration, for its incredible and annihilating hopelessness. The other tracks are moodily beautiful and remarkably accessible, occasionally verging on sentimentality. Only quibble - the Mixed Up version of Fascination Street is stronger, longer, tougher and better than the track here."
5,There is beauty in despair,"A soundscape fashioned from raindrops and purple velvet, Disintegration is a seminal album. Sombre yet ethereal, introspective yet universal, this album redefined The Cure's legacy. Plainsong, The Same Deep Waters As You, Prayers For Rain...these are as achingly wistful now as they were ten years ago. An album that deserves to be absorbed and then adored."
2,Accurate Title,"Do Not Disturb is a frothy and light romance starring the lovely Doris Day and the charming Rod Taylor. There was one thing about this movie that prevented me from fully enjoying it, however, and it took me a while to pinpoint what is was. Surprisingly enough, it was Miss Day herself. She seems to be taking the dizzy blonde American character to an extreme here, and comes across as trying too hard (almost frenetic in the last half) throughout the entire film. Rod Taylor, on the other hand, appears as relaxed and effortless as ever. The chemistry the two demonstrate in The Glass Bottom Boat is sadly not in play here, and the movie suffers for it. Great Sixties fashion and snappy dialogue still need well-rounded characters to provide that special interplay that can draw in repeat viewers. Only for hard-core Day or Taylor fans, although perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon while flipping through magazines."
1,boring mormon propaganda,"I was drawn to this book because of Enders Game (like most people who read his stuff), but this was BORING, tedious Mormon propaganda. At points it feels like he was getting paid by the numbers of pages he wrote, and, he figured that since he is the author of the highly popular ""Enders Game"" he has the license to subject his readers (listeners) to his views on Mormonism, while, ironically enough, MIScharacterizing non-Mormon ""religion"".This is the first time I've understood when people have said that characters in books can be caricatures rather than characters. The people in this book are most definitely caricatures. Real people do not act as melodramatic and over the top as his characters do.I 100% agree with previous poster about it being especially difficult to LISTEN to this book. I got to the point where I simply skipped whole chapters and found out I hadn't missed anything.Very Very disappointed."
4,Chinese Grammar,I'm a Chinese Language major in college so I need as much help as i can get. I retnted this book from the library and was pleasantly surprised by it's layout and the easy was that it explained grammar points. I use this book all the time and think that this book will definitely help me progress further into the Chinese Language.
4,Grammy winner lost?,"Lisa Fisher's steller debut ""So Intense"" produced the Grammy Award winning hit ""How Can I Ease The Pain."" Since that time we've been deprived of her masterful vocals. For me, the ballads are what really pushes this album. Tracks 3,4,5,9, and 10 are stunningly produced. Fisher's voice is as current and modern as anyone else's out there today. Fisher, who shared that 1992 Grammy Award with Patti Labelle (she for the album ""Burnin'""), is past due for a new release. Walden, Giles, and Mardin may not be as hot as they were back then, but there is still Michael J. Powell, Nick Martinelli, and even Babyface out there needing the work. So, Electra Records, what are you waiting for?"
4,What a talent!,"Lisa Fischer has a beautiful voice, but with the except of ""How Can I Ease the Pain,"" these songs don't do her justice. With better material, she could be a huge star. Right up there with Celine Dion and Whitney Houston."
4,Clarification of the Pieces on the Cassette,"The music on this tape was performed by the Orchestra of the National Music Institute of Korea, of which Kim Ki-su was director. A brief summary of the history of Korean Court Music is given on the inside of the cassette liner.The English names for the pieces on the cassette are as follows:SIDE ONE: 1. Confucian Music 2. Confucian Music 3. Springtime in Loyang 4. Long Life Immeasurable as the Sky 5. Two Instrumental Preludes for Cross Flute and Long ZitherSIDE TWO: 1. Lyric Song 2. Lyric song 3. Lyric Song 4. Military Music 5. Stone Chimes"
5,excellent resource for....,"This book is great if you are studying for the PCUSA Bible Content exam, for it has all of the old exams and answer keys. If you can ""master"" all of the exams, you will pass the content exam, and maybe even learn something!"
3,A sub par pair.,I have tried many brands of wheel chair tires over the years. These are not the worst I've ever bought but they are far from the best. Not worth the cost. Spend a little more and get a far better tire.
2,"Bad dye job, nice style","The style is so attractive that I really wanted them, but the left and right were two different shades of red so I returned them."
2,Used book for a class,"This book has some coding errors in it, but nothing I wasn't able to work around. If it wasn't the required book for the course I was taking I would not of bought this book. It is dated and uses HTML coding that has been deprecated and compares operating systems that are no longer suported. (Windows95/98). Find a book that is more current."
1,is there an error list on the web for this?,All I need is a sheet with the errors in it. I have found many myself!
1,Too many errors,The book covers only few of JavaScript concepts (surely not complete concepts and techniques). What bothers me are many errors. In lesson 3 I could get only rollovers to work properly. The book is too expensive for what it offers.
4,Good company,"I like Mark Schweizer's liturgical mysteries. His characters are good company, the things he finds funny about religious observance, I also find funny (and I speak as a believer). If what you're looking for is tight plotting, devious and deeply explored characters, or thrilling climaxes, look elsewhere. But if what you want is a pleasant way to spend time in your summer hammock or beach chair, any of the ""X Wore Y"" books will suit you just fine."
5,A Soprano's Slightly Skewed Sentiments,"I applaud this book. I can't wait to read the abuse he will heap upon the head of the poor misunderstood soprano. I enjoy the terrible writing, the awful puns and most of all the stories about choirs, churches and small towns. Hog and his chicken were my favorite characters thus far. The Tenor Wore Tapshoes was my favorite book of the three I've read. And everything I have read thus far rings true, from church politicking to children speaking their mind in church! This series is so much fun I laugh out loud reading it. I come from a completely different religious tradition, grew up in Hawaii and live in Canada. The characters may change location, but the humanity will out! Thank you, Mr. Schweizer, for writing these wonderful books!"
5,great photos,"great reference book with a good number of photos. if you like this architectural style, you'll love this book of house plans."
4,A fresh breath of air,"This book rings true to Jack London's character - strong, nobel and powerful. It is interesting to see how truly his character comes through even in the smallest characters or the smallest insignificant event. Very inspiring!The actual story deals with this couple who decide to leave Oakland. It is autobiographical and again its amazing to see how many books have come out of Jack London's rich and variegated life! Also the turning point in the character's lives comes through another character who must have been the young Jack London!The interesting side to this book is a potrayal of two women and feminine views (not to be misunderstood with feminist views). Its surprising to read Jack London talking about pretty underthings!On the whole a beautiful book, very varied in character!"
2,Can't get through it.,"Started reading Jack London lately and really like his work. This is way different from the London that I am used to reading. Very boring. No excitement. Must be another side of Jack London, but I'm not interested. Can't get past the the first four chapters. Don't think that I am going to try anymore either."
5,The Dance House: Stories from Rosebud,"This book is an incredible insight into a dance house. The stories will make you laugh and cry, sometimes on the same page. I enjoyed these stories. I read them from time to time when I am feeling down, or happy or just want to read them again."
2,Translator In Error,"This version of this book should not be on the list of greatiest religious books!Initially i was excited to find this text. Upon purchasing the book i discovered, from the authors introductory essays, an obvious lack of belief(even a hint of distaste) in the religion itself expressed by the author. Imagine an abject islamic scholar translating the torah. I would not trust the translations for the lack of heart behind the work. Try other more rare translations, perhaps The Holy Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib Vol. 1 thru 4 by ~ Kartar Singh DuggalThank you"
2,This is a Last Resort,"Trumpp has an obvious bias against Sikhs that he in no way tries to hide. He frequently cites the text in his commentaries as ""proof"" that the Sikhs are polytheistic and worship female, Hindu deities. Any intelligent person who has ever studied Sikhism, even at an elementary level, knows this is not true.I give this two stars because it is the only English translation - if it deserves to be called that - that I could find of the complete SGGS. if you can find something else, and can afford it, I would entirely recommend you get that. Otherwise, this should be a last resort."
3,disappointing,"Assumed this was made in France with an easy to clean coating like other French products but it's actually made in China and does not have the easy to clean coating. It was disappointing. If you want French products, try Appolia or Emile Henry."
3,Not made in France,"I received this today and was disappointed because I thought it was made in France but turns out it is made in Thailand. The color is nice and hopefully it does not crack as some reviews have indicated. If you are looking for products made in France, try the Appolia brand."
1,abba super troupers,this is not a cdg disk and i have no use for it !I want to exchange this for a abba CDG disk.Please E-Mail me ASAP
1,fraud,this is the 2nd time I have been burned by an advertised cd as being a karaoke cd. This has no lyrics. I bought if for a little ABBA - loving girl who was very dissappointed.
1,"MODERN MARVELS:"" ROLLACOASTERS""",Only got five minutes of show when downloaded! Most of it was comercial for Modern Marvels. It say's show should be 49 minutes!!!
5,This Product Is Awesome,"I Currently Work A Customer Service Position From Home, And I Live Right By a Train Track. ""Thomas"" Visits Quite Often.....LOL, And My Job Has A Noise Policy, ""You Know What That Means"". This Little Tiny guy Is A Lifesaver!!!!! I Didn't Know My Fingers Can Move That Fast...LOL"
1,Wow what a ugly pose!,Well i do like a new pose from mcfarlane but wow this pose is ugly. I wonder what other players they will reuse this pose for. Do not get me wrong there are 1-2 customs out there with a different player for this pose which looks darn good. Just that this pose looks bad for the colors or something. When you get it in person you will agree. Looks even worse opened & posed. This is why this one is one of the leftover ones last to be sold out when it first came out. It is not even good for a custom. I just hope mcfarlane scrapes this pose. I RB 3 pack variant of it is way to many of this pose.I can not wait for a cutler to be released end of the year. GO Broncos!
4,Antony Starluck's Positive Message Uplifting to Heart,Artist has an excellent voice along with professional arrangements provide a relaxing as well as energizing experience at the same time. In today's negative society with many music artists pouring out depressing and often suicidal messages it's reassuring that someone still has hope in this crazy world and gives back to society a little gift. Thanks.
4,Good book for students...,"This book is great! I bought it for a class I teach and it covers modern/current societal topics (abortion, death penalty, ecological issues, immigration) and sparked a lot of conversations amongst my students. It's a good book to use for debates (as it makes you choose one side or another of the topics presented)..."
1,Not a SACD,"This is not a SACD as it was said in the item description, it's a import cd from Japan, not the Mo-Fi rdition."
1,i would give this zero stars if i could,"I dont like the pixies at all, but this is definatly their crowning acheivement."
3,mixed business,"while i love the pixies, i'm not about to claim that they can do no wrong. personally, i object to the more accessible nature of this album and would urge all prospective pixies fans to purchase ""surfer rosa"" first. while some of ""surfer's"" discordant and abrasive punk spirit remains intact on ""doolittle,"" in tracks like ""hey"", ""gouge away"", and ""dead"", the album also features melodic pop ballads like ""la la love you"" and the mildly countrified ""silver"" which make me wince. the twisted passion of ""surfer rosa"" is lacking here, not to mention the humour.nonetheless, the intricate interplay of black and deal's vocals is still breath-taking. the good parts of this album are far, far better than the crap that masquerades as indie these days. and one has to like the opening track ""debaser,"" as it heavily references the surreal cinema piece, ""un chien andalou."" but there are weak parts, as well, and you can expect to be skipping around the tracks upon each listening."
5,I taught Frank Black everything he knows,"A girlfriend in high school turned me on to the Pixies as she was turning me on. After that, how could I go back to the way thing were before? It's been years, but Doolittle still sounds like I just heard it yesterday. Frank Black, I love you man."
5,Great Book!,great book! I like her style of writing! I went on to read others by her and was not dissapointed!
4,Great Ronstadt release,This is a great pop release from Linda Ronstadt. Linda has one of the best female voices of all time and in large part because of her range and ability to do so many different styles of music.
3,Not the Canon brand,Just a warning to make sure you know this is a replacement tank not by Canon. I mistakenly thought it was when I ordered it but I guess I should have looked more closely.
4,"Very nice performance, but no Ali Akbar Khan","This is indeed a very nice performance. But I wanted to rain on Deepa Mathur's parade a little. To say that Ustad Ali Akbar Khan's reputation is mostly hype (and that Tejendra Majumdar is near the pinnacle of Khan-sahib's achievements) is the height of silliness. Unfortunately, my opinion of Khan-sahib's opus is formed on the entire breadth of his life and especially the great recordings of the 1960's through the early 1980's, and I have long felt that the quality of his recordings has dropped off of late. But keep in mind that he is now 82 years old!Look into the Signature Series, especially Vols. 1 and 3 of Ali Akbar Khan. I predict that you will also be pleasantly surprised by the incomparable tabla playing of the late Mahapurush Misra."
2,Snake skin bucket seat covers,Not even sure if these seat covers are still around so I'll make this review short. They shed like a dog but look like a snake. And they didn't last very long before they ripped out. So if you want fuzz on your Butt buy these seat covers.
3,What Happened...,"When ""Tonight The Stars Revolt"" came out and I heard ""When World's Collide"" I actually left my house to by that CD. When I heard ""Transform"" hit the shelf's I left my house to by it (along with Evanescence), at least I wasn't disappointed with one of the CD's I bought that day. ""Transform"" indeed. It sounds like they took everything that made them original and threw it out the window. Maybe the more I listen to it the more I will get to like it, that's happened more than a few times. But I'm kind of doubting that this time. I normally love Powerman 5000 and I've even seen them live (with Korn and Papa Roach), but this album simply didn't sit well. If you're new to PM5K might I recommend ""Tonight The Stars Revolt,"" and if you do get this album and like it (it's all about personal taste friends, I'm just telling you mine), then don't bother with ""Tonight..."" ""Transform"", indeed."
5,awsome,"this cd is great, all the beats are catchy and the lyrics are great, theres not one bad or ok song on here, its a perfect score"
1,...????,"I dunno what these guys were thinkin with this cd but it sounds nothing like ""Tonight the Stars Revolt"". This cd is a huge disappointment. Powerman 5000 was one of my favourite bands because of their unique brand of metal with a space and electronic atmosphere. ""Transform"" sounds similar to a Smashmouth cd, which needless to say [is bad]. If you were a big fan of PM5K after ""Tonight the Stars Revolt"" skip this album and hopefully PM5K will revert or ""Transform"" back to the way they were for the next one."
2,Transform is dissapointing.,"Powerman 5000's relase of Transform is definatley one of the most dissapointing relases. All the good stuff about PM5K (the sci-fi themes, space suits, the nice vocals) have all gone away, and turned into just anothers simple alt band. PM5K should have relased anyone for doomsday, because we would have different to listen to that sounds like what PM5K should song like, other than the amazing Tonight The Stars Revolt. I am PM5K fan, and I hope they don't continue going down this road on the next albums."
2,Depressing.,I wouldn't watch this unless you have a specific interest in this type of film or are somewhat masochistic. Hard film.
5,JESUS ROCKS!,"My mom gave me this book for my birthday, and I read it, and I was like, totally, amazed! It's like so good, and it teaches you how to party with Satan! Rock on everybody!"
4,Just bought one today -- pretty excited about it,"Based partly on the reviews on this site, we just bought this unit at Circuit City (wanted to buy at a store rather than website for various reasons.) VERY happy we did, since Circuit City just put this item for sale for less than one hundred dollars, and it included a free dual LNB Dish! We can't wait for our installer to come and enable our entry to the DirecTV/TiVo world of TV viewing. We have a 2 1/2 year old and a 10 month old, and could really use TV at our convenience. I will update this review in a few months after we've used it awhile."
1,** Unsatisfied Customer **,"I purchased this product, and although I love the concept the TIVO has to offer I personally have had problems with bad reception! I have been on the phone with tech support, with level2 tech support, and I have gone through the returning and recieving of three different units. I have changed the cables and the connectors, I hooked up our old sat dish reciever and had no problem with reception, The last tech said "" It has to be something in the environment,try an in line amp.!""We did thatand still bad reception. All I want at this point is to return the unit and get my money back since NO ONE can seem to help me.I don't know where to go from here, I was told I can't return it for a refund it's too late, so are you gonna tell me I'm stuck with a unit I can't use?! I really hope not. I would appreciateany guidance you can give me. Maybe even credit toward another brand. We have been messing with this problem for the last 3 months.ThankyouSheri Cleary"
1,Doesn't work with cable tv,"This unit only works with DirectTV, it does not allow you to integrate cable or air tv with the same system. Seems pointless if you want to be able to record multiple programs from both sources."
1,Don't buy,"When I bought the Tivo set I thought it was great and really enjoyed all the features. But now after just 4 month the modem in the Tivo set is broken, which means it can't dial into the program guide etc. anymore. this means Tivo is pretty much useless. I thought this should be not a big deal until I found out [what it costs to] send in the set to Philips (plus shipping). Just to repair the modem!!! I get a whole new set for that price! Besides the fact that Philips seems to have a problem with their customer service (the average hold time is 45 minutes - I tried it every day during the last 2 weeks). Tivo is great if it works but the machine itself seems to have some mechanical problems that they need to fix before I will buy a set again. If you buy it, just buy it with a warranty."
5,This thing rocks!,"Before I bought this I read people's reviews and thought, ""yeah, right, like it's really that good."" Well, surprise...it really IS that good and then some. TiVo changes the whole TV paradigm. No more sitting down and thinking, ""gee, I hope something's on"" and channel surfing for an hour and walking away depressed. Now we sit down with TV and there's a ton of programs recorded and waiting to watch, more than we can possibly get to. We keep finding more and more things that we like about TiVo, more ways to search for programming that we like, and the TiVo suggestions are getting more accurate, even though we have eclectic tastes. The picture and sound quality are much better than our previous DTV receiver (Sony).Overall, TiVo tames the TV beast, especially the TV beast that having 200 satellite channels can be. Only drawback; I'm watch way more TV than I used to!"
4,Another great mudvayne album,"Let me start off by saying this is quite a change for Mudvayne and I know many fans of LD50 will be disappointed. I personally prefered The End Of All Things To Come over both LD50 and this one but anyway this CD took awhile to grow on me... unlike the last. It's quite a bit softer and shows a more ""mainstream"" side of mudvayne. I am slightly disappointed in this album but i think that it's because I had too high expectations for it. There are some instant classics on here such as Determined,IMN, Pushing Through, Just and I even liked Happy? (many fans weren't impressed by this). Overall this shows a more melodic and softer side of Mudvayne but don't get me wrong there are still some incredibly heavy parts reminiscent of LD50. If you are a true Mudvayne fan check this out and if you're not check it out anyway you may like the change. Great effort and I hope they release many more in the future."
3,3 1/2,"Mudvayne's ""Lost and Found"" isnt anywhere as strong as ""End of All Things to Come"" yet it is still a pretty solid release. The problem that I have with this CD, is that some where in the middle of the disc, the damn thing just starts draggin with some horrid filler material. There wasnt one bad song on ""End Of all Things"" I am hoping that Mudvayne doesnt sell out and change style of music, just because they are pretty popular . They are a very talented and creative Metal Band (I cant call them Nu-Metal, because I just dont hear that in their music) and I was really hoping for alot more from them. There are some really good tracks here, and even the overplayed ""Happy"" is a great song, yet some of this really fails, and I know they can do much better. Hopefully the next CD will be up to par with their other releases."
4,better than ever!,"i have always enjoyed mudvayne's more popular (radio friendly) singles of the past. some of the other songs on previous albums were just too odd for me. but 'lost and found' has hit the nail on the head. wow, this cd is fantastic (yeah i know its mellowed and not as hard as previous albums).way to go mudvayne, keep up the good work!"
5,So far so good,"Ive heard the entire cd a bunch of months ago and i loved it so much that i listened to it over and over (because my moron friend put it on repeat) Unfortunately i can only remember a handful of songs Like Determined, Happy, Fall Into Sleep, and Forget To Remember heres the stats for those fourDetermined 5/5 Short and sweet with an outstanding aggressive growl and a great pause (1 2 3 GO....) Its intense recomend for all metal fansHappy 5/5 Great song... no awesome song it headlined one wrestling event i cant remember and i was shocked. I heard it and OMG I loved itFall Into Sleep 5/5 Beautifully crafted in their own style. Its heavy and has melody just what i want in a songForget To Remember 5/5 For any Saw fans this was the first song off the ending credits on Saw 2 another great song. Doesnt have as much melody as Fall into sleep but its still awesome and kicks serious buttI will update this once i buy the cd and hear them all for myself"
2,"Like ""With Teeth"" of NIN, this is a major dissapointment","I heard this album, tried to get into but just couldn't. L.D 50 was good, The end of all things to come was good, but Lost and Found just sinks below both big time. I mean, it to me lacks SO MUCH of what mudvayne was, where is the heavy and complex bass of Martinie? Where is the heaviness that made them good. I feel as though they just took a different direction on this album and strayed away from what was Mudvayne. Even dropped the makeup, which is cool, but still play the killer music that you used too play and still can play. You have to have a REAL open mind for this album, and I have an open mind, lol. And you have to be a die hard mudvayne fanatic to like this album. This isn't the only album to come from a good band and turned out to STINK. ""With Teeth"" by nine inch nails was horrible as well. I hope Trent and Mudvayne get back to making good music again, at least that's what I think"
1,^Was not able to give this crap a O star rating...,"Yeah.. this CD was PRETTY SAD.. made me cry even. And no..it wasnt the subjects of the songs.. it was.. like.. ""where the hell did Mudvayne go?"" What is sad is.. their BASS is ALWAYS great.. but.. even it was horrible in this CD...I mean.. SADLY.. the best song on here is ""Happy?"".. and yeah.. its like the most retarded song I've ever heard. Actual metal fans.. DO NOT WASTE YA MONEY.."
3,three,"This album has some great songs, and I mean great great songs, Mudvayne is one hard music making band, but this album can't be compared to their previous works... Good album thoughBut if you're looking for something like their last works, not the best there is..."
5,Evolve or Dissolve!,"To anybody who feels that metal should stay stagnant in their progress of their evolution should then stay with Linkin Park, Trapt or Godsmack. If you do you won't ever be disappointed. For those of you who take great pride in watching some of your favorite bands take the next step in musical progress should then take a hardy bite out of this album. Coined with the category ""Math Metal"" by Chad Grey this band is as distant from Nu-Metal as Tool or Deftones as I have heard it described by some. This album blends the raw vocals and unpredictable time signatures of ""LD50"" with the melody of their follow up album ""The End of All Things to Come"" and then pushed the envelope a little more. Mudvayne is much more polished and for that I commend them. And also for that they are a much superior band than they used to be. So get your @$$ moving and pick up this album. You won't be disappointed!"
5,There best effort yet.,"Alright, I will admit I have liked several of the more popular songs by this band over the last couple of years. Saw them live at Ozzfest and liked them very much. However, I have not bothered to buy their albums up to now. Much like Slipknot, I have felt they were very good at the type of music that they choose to play (loud, aggressive, more screamed vocals than singing, less bass driven and melodic than traditional hard rock), but it was just not the sound for me. However, with Lost and Found this band has matured and I have to admit that I really like several of the slower, more powerful tracks such as 'Happy', 'Forget to Remember' and in particular 'Fall into Sleep'. Much like 'Duality' and 'Before I Forget' by Slipknot I find these types of songs which slowly build into a more powerful rift or chorus (like Cemetary Gates by Pantera or Black Lodge by Anthrax) to be great songs to listen to while I am at the gym."
5,An amazing infusion of old and new,"Before this album came out, LD. 50 was probably my favorite Mudvayne album. It had more complex instrumentals than End of all things to come, had some heavier parts, and i thought was just an all around tighter album. End of all things to come was good too in the sense that, while the screaming wasn't quite as good, the singing was better and the songs were a little catchier, though not as much fun to listen to. This album takes everything that I loved about those two CDs and combines them into Mudvayne's finest release yet. There isn't a single song on here that I don't like and just the right blend of heavy and more mainstream sounds. There's some of that good old mudvayne anger in songs like Determined, Stepping Through, and Imn as well as some awesome melodies on songs like Happy, Fall into Sleep, and Forget to Remember. A musical triumph."
5,Mudvayne roolz,"I own all of the mudvayne cd's, and this one is easily the best. this cd friggin roolz, the best song on the album is Forget to remember, which is featured in the horror movie saw 2. other good tracks are fall into sleep, determined, choices, happy?, and Rain. sun. gone., if your not a metal fan, YOU SHOULD BE! so get off your friggin [...] and buy this album!!"
1,Reads like a patsy high school year book,"A lot of sappy coverage on the pilots... reads like a high school yearbook written by a drunk cheerleader. A lot of motherhood statements and glorified rubbish about the Imperial Japanese Navy. Interesting that the writer claims that the IJN only had a few of its planes shot down during the Mariannas Turkey Shoot. If I were you, I'd just borrow it from the library, worth a laugh."
1,Hata is careless with sources and commits sloppy analysis,Hata writes a great book apart from the fact that the sources chosen are overly biased and Hata does not acknowledge this. Also the fact that Hata goes into this foray with a direct intention to discredit Iris Chang with her claims in the Rape of Nanking is damaging to what is otherwise a plausible extrapulation of a complex issue.
4,a present,"This was a Xmas present for my wife and she was very very happy with it. Audio and video were good. Installation was easy, BUT before you start go to Radio Shack and buy the 90 degree coaxle adapter, you will need it. Put adapter on BEFORE installing. Bottom line: I would buy another one."
2,Disappointed - Not at all like Karizma,"I bought this CD because I heard Landau for the first time with Karizma. He was great on that CD. There were no samples of this one on the web site so just bought it figuring it would be great too.Was I disappointed. I am a guitarist, so I was hoping for a guitar album. It wasnt. It is a bunch of so-so songs with so-so profuction.Music is subjective, so you may love this CD. But listen to samples somewhere first!"
1,Don't bother,"To be frank, I found this trilogy so be the absolute worst book that I have ever read (it was an omnibus). The 'hero' spent most of his time whining, and making everyone else suffer along with him. The writing was well done, but the plot and characters were hopeless. Don't waste your time plowing through it..."
2,"I loved this when I was 15, now I know better","I thought this book (and series) was great when I was 15 years old. I recently re-read Lord Foul's Bane and wondered ""What was I thinking?""Now, I simply cannot get past the whining main character. Thomas Covenant tries to justify raping a 16 year old on his Unbeliever schtick and pules and whines throughout the book. Frankly, I wanted to smack him. I suppose when I was 15, his excuses seemed reasonable. Now I know they're ridiculous nonsense.I suppose in 1977, The Thomas Covenant Chronicles were an epic fantasy in a genre with a wide audience looking for another Lord of the Rings. Today, there's a whole library of superior epic fantasy to choose from. Don't waste your time with this thin gruel."
3,Not as good as I expected,"After reading the reviews of this series plus other works by Donaldson, I expected great things from this book. I was sorely disappointed! Although the action is at times exciting, I got weary of Covenant's whining and self-loathing quickly. Yes, it's an important aspect of his character, but to hear it expressed in every sentence he utters was just a bit much. I won't be reading any of the subsequent books in this series."
1,"The ""hero"" rapes a minor.","It was frankly impossible for me to get past that, and find it hard to understand how any well-adjusted person could do so.The so called hero of the story has many deep character flaws, and I frankly did not find that entertaining. This world he creates is torpid and bland. I just don't see now anyone could consider this book entertaining."
2,Interesting idea....too much groaning,"I liked the idea; leper, outcast and unbeliever as a hero who causes more harm than good in some cases. That idea got me through some of the worst writing I have ever read. Everyone is groaning and spitting. No one says anything. They all groan through their teeth. After hacking through it all, there was a payoff of an idea. And that was worth the read to me. But the jungle of groans is hard to slash through. I do not wish this book on anyone. Go read Orson Scott Card instead."
1,Unbeliever? Try Unbelievable.,"I have never had to fight my way to the end of a book like I did with this one, and by the time I turned the last page, I wasn't sure that I'd won the bout.This was literary agony. I should have never even bothered finishing it. The main character is an unlikeable, self-absorbed whiner, the writing is plodding, the overall effect is depressing. Covenant himself is the most unlikeable part of this book; when he's not feeling sorry for himself, he's behaving abominably (won't say how, it's sort of a plot point ... at least as far as a plot exists here).I don't object to anti-heroes. They're valid literary devices. But an anti-hero always manages to have at least one redeeming characteristic, and Covenant has none.Save yourself the waste of time. Go read some Eddings, Duane or Stasheff instead."
3,Lord Foul's Bane -Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever,"This book was very interesting once I adjusted to all the strange names and places...the Glossary really helped.Lots of imagination, exciting at times, but dragged through too much descriptive detail. I will not read thenext to books in the series."
1,I wouldn't recommend this series to all,"Although Donaldson is a great writer, if you like a good hero and fun reading, this is not the series for you. I've read hundreds of fantasy books and by the end of this series, I just wanted the main character to die and end all of the depressing reading. So don't say I didn't warn you."
5,Excelent Starting Book for a Superb Story,"The story of Covenant is a great one, the way he stephen Donaldson writes, the form that he builds his character and unfolds the history, the events.., all. the way the reader feels, sure it is a series where the only thing the reader wont do is to stay calm. In fact the 6 books are So good. That are read tireless."
1,This book might be considered good if...,"... you consider the fact that many of us have coffee tables that need to be shimmed up under one leg. I hated to hate this book. I think that many of the side characters were interesting and deserving of living in a fantasy world where TC should never show his face. I read both TC trilogies hoping that somewhere along the way, TC would develop a spine and mature emotionally if not intellectually. My brother recommended the series only to tell me after I had finished that he had never made it all the way through as he couldn't stomach the depressive quality of the main character"
2,Decent Story - Bad characters,"The story is pretty good and all three books in the series are relatively fast reads, but the main and central character is so unlikeable and consistently annoying that it ruins the experience."
2,Only for anti-hero fans,"Donaldson`s Covenant trilogy is a very strange undertaking. He chooses an unlikely hero, a leper who is anything, but your average fantasy hero. In fact his major concern is how to keep out of things. Of course this doesn`t work for him and he unwillingly destroys everyone around him. For three long volumes we see him struggling. The choice of such a hero and the idea that whole story unfolds only in his imagination is exciting, but the ending is not true to itself. At the very end (after nearly everyone has died)the main character who has not been able to do anything positive in the past three books, suddenly transforms into a real hero, who defeats the enemy with his supernatural powers. This is a very, very disappointing ending to the story, because it goes against the whole plot of the book.One other thing. This book is strictly for native english speakers (even they will have difficulty)."
1,Beware...a Hero that wines and is unsepathetic,"I read this book some years ago and just thinking about it to write this review pains me. It's like trying to remember how it felt to have a stainless steel spike driven thru your skull.The ""Hero"" is annoying, winey and while reading this book, I longed for his death or disappearance. The book is a slow, hard read. If your thing is reading about people you'd never want to run into/ know (and that's our ""Hero""), then this book is for you!How this book has had a run as a series of books is beyond me. The story has no appeal to me. I can't identify with the main character and it's a horrible read. Honestly, I wish I had never read it. You have been warned!"
2,Denial is really tedious,"My problem with this book is the main character, Thomas Covenant. His self-absorbed denial gets really, really old after a while. For instance, he refuses to eat because eating would mean that he buys into the Land which ""obviously"" can't exist. Oh please, get over yourself! I think the story would have been a lot more engaging and zippy if the reader weren't forced to wade through his rotten attitude on every page."
4,Solid addition,"This is a good addition to any collection if you like reggae at all. One step forward, I chase the devil and Norman are highlights. Solid cd from front to back."
3,"Good book for kid, but the item is not clear","I bought this book for my son, who was 9 months, and he happy with this. One thing I feel dissatisfied that the book look like old and dirty. I hope the seller more attention to this."
2,Dissapointing,I was a little let down by the book. I find the subject matter extreamly interesting. I've always wanted to personally go through a mothball ship yard and explore the vessels. The book really doesn't do it for me. I wanted page after page of descriptions of layed up ships with information on how they were mothballed and being maintained. I did not like the way the book jumps from operational history to lay up. There are plenty of books about WW2 battles I can buy. I wanted to hear more about the process of deactivation and possibly more first hand accounts from the workers involved. I also wanted to know more about the reasons some were kept longer than others and how some were brought back to service. There is not enough info on more modern ships from the post WW2 era and almost nothing on current preserved ships. definatly a keeper but not all that the reviews so far have made it out to be.
5,Like riding a roller coaster.,"I have always enjoyed Davis Bunn's leisurely, but to the point, approach to his story telling. The Lazarus Trap breaks the mold, though; it is unusually fast paced. This is not a book you want to start on a weekday evening; unless, of course, you don't worry about calling in sick the next morning.Imagine waking up, hurting all over, bleeding from the forehead; you have no memory of anything, including who you are. What you do have is a wad of cash in your pocket and a driver's license that says Jeffrey Adams. Even with nothing else to go on, Jeffrey Adams doesn't seem right.In bits and pieces, fragments of his life start coming back to Val Haines; but the mystery is just beginning. Maybe an email in his computer will shed some light, so he replies to Audry. He was supposed to be dead. As it turns out, maybe being dead was for the best. A past that Val cannot outrun comes roaring back to life.As good as this novel is, it would make a better movie."
1,Milking it!,"Don't buy this if you even remotely like Holdsworths current stuff. Sounds like an unrehearsed, below average 60's bar/cover band. Unfocused hippie vocals with unrelated guitar nuddeling. The poor recording quality doesn't help either. Somebody's really trying to make money on everything that can be dug up with Holdsworth on it. Sad. ..."
2,Very cute,"Received in the mail promptly. It's very cute but does not cover light very well for me. The inside is pink also, usually it's black so that you would not see light shining throught he fabric. The strap is not adjustable so it's sort of loose on my small head. Did not do the job for me but it looks cute."
4,great debut album,"This I feel to be the best of the Lynch Mob efforts. A must have for all Dokken fans. I just wanted to write this review because I just stumbled upon a great album from Pure 13 called ""Numb"". After listening to it, I discovered it was done by Anthony, who was the bass player for Lynch Mob. Great album! Everyone here should start to check out that band. In fact, I heard rumors of Pure 13 and Lynch Mob doing a tour together. How sweet would that be???"
3,A bit like Badlands,"George Lynch left Dokken, brought drummer Mick Brown with him and recruited a great singer by the name of Oni Logan and Anthony Esposito (bass) to form his own band - Lynch Mob. In 1990 came the first album and it's obvious that Lynch wanted to break free from the radio friendly pop metal direction of Dokken since this effort is loud and heavy but still rather melodic. The opening groovy and heavy ""Wicked sensation"" is just a great heavy metal song and the same goes for ""River of love"" and ""All I want"". The music reminds a bit of Badlands (featuring Ray Gillen - R.I.P and Jake E Lee), and like Badlands, Lynch Mob's material have a tendency to melt together. For the follow up album (simply titled ""Lynch Mob""), singer Logan was for some reason gone and that's a shame because that new guy wasn't of the same calibre besides the fact that on the follow up album the material was a lot weaker."
1,Lost Gem,"I picked this up just yesterday on CD but actually had bought it on Cassette when it first came out in back 1990. This album as a whole is really good so I'm surprised that it didn't do better than it did. My personal favorite tracks are ""Wicked Sensation"" which I believe there was a video for), ""Sweet Sister Mercy"", ""All I Want"", ""Dance Of The Dogs"", & ""No Bed Of Roses"". So if you like ""Dokken"" or just like heavy blues rock 'n roll, do yourself a favor and pick this up..the whole album is good. I might also add their second album simply titled ""Lynch Mob"" is pretty good as well, they do a killer version of ""Queens"" ""Tie Your Mother Down"" on that one. I Give it five Five stars."
5,Billy shows that he can bring life to any musical form.,"On this release, comprised mostly of covers, Billy gives what equates to an eye opening history lesson. Yet this lesson is undeniably musical. High-points can be found in The Red Flag, and My Youngest Son Came Home Today."
3,Blake Vs Bragg,"Bring me another bard, the world is too small to breathe. Bragg relates the uniquness of being English and affords the illness of the French. Not an oustanding album, but Blakes Jerusalem will resound in the knaves should the king rise from the ashes. Oh, an Englishman and his naivety...long live Bragg..."
1,Zzzzzz,"This book is a snore. Frankly, I picked it up because it looked and sounded somewhat interesting and steamy - nothing could be further from the truth. I don't like the male lead, it's taken 200 pages to slowly travel for a couple of days - most of which the female lead is by herself in a small, enclosed, wooden wagon that has been likened to a grave... this is one big bore. And, one big false advertisement."
1,NO BATTERY BACK UP!!,"We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!! They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center! Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from. If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up?"
4,Transformar Fell Out of Receptacle,"Great gadget! I really like this full featured player. It is easy to operate in the dark because you soon learn what buttons are where, however, I'll be getting a small computer UPS to power it. I came home from work today and it was un-plugged. The big heavy transformer fell out of the receptacle. Maybe the cat did it. Not much there to hold it in. Any kind of household vibration could do it. No battery backup built in so the presets and the time go away. It flashes 1200 when you plug it back in just like a VCR. Must have been designed by a comittee. OOPS"
1,very disappointed,"As an elementary music teacher and voice teacher I am looking for good vocal recordings. It is very difficult to find recorded songs for children that aren't sung with quacky, phony voices. I bought this album hoping to have some well-sung songs, but instead what did I hear? Someone trying to ""style"" children's songs...and not very well at that; out-of-tune singing and phony sounds. Feinstein is often singing in too low a tessitura."
3,Well made valve but....,"Well made valve, finish is great but does not cut water flow off 100%. I bought this out of laziness to try and cure a slow drip on a shower head, unfortunately this valve does not stop 100% of the water flow and I still have a drip."
5,A Great Cover,"I own a 2003 Jeep Wrangler and have had issues trying to keep my seats cool, especially in hot, 95 and above degree days. These covers are so soft that upon sitting on them, your body slides into place- that's correct- SLIDES! It's never too hot to sit down anymore and goes over my bucket seats easily. It has a soft feel and enhances the intense blue exterior of my Jeep, drawing attention to my seats. Everyone complements me on them. A great bang for the buck!"
3,I'm starting to get into it !,"I picked this up 1996 or 1997 at a Best Buy in North Carolina. The album was sold without a jewel case, just a thin piece of cardboard resembling a miniature double-album LP package. It was a 20-bit ""Master Sound"" Japanese import. I had to have this ! It seemed rare to me at the time. I am enjoying the album again as I type this review. The music is intense to listen to, even when played at a low volume. I am playing it on my 5-CD changer, alone with the two disc Lucinda Williams ""Live at the Fillmore"" from 2005 and Lou Reed's ""Sally Can't Dance"" from 1974. I think I finally hit on the right combination. Feel free to follow my lead."
1,Music to Torture Someone By,"Oh my stars, this music is soooooooooooooooooooooo boring.I guarantee you,if you were to lock up some criminal and force him to listen to this, you would be in violation of Geneva."
4,Great,"Dr. Dhillon's interpretation of these timeless folk tales is unquestionably the best i have ever read. As a former student of his, i have had the honour and pleasure of actually having witnessed him tell one of his stories to an audience of which i was a member and i can only say that hearing him tell one of his stories completely eclipses the pleasure of reading it. I would recommend this and any of his other books to everyone."
4,Seller had no problems,"I erroneously entered the wrong shipping address and thus never received the product. I did, however, receive a quick refund once the product was returned to the seller. This is NOT the fault of the seller."
5,Listen Up Puff Daddy,"I love this album. It's absolutely impossible to put it on and not dance and sing along. This is what sampling is all about.I love Lady Miss Keir with her raspberry flip, chunky platforms and dee-groovey vibe. The perfect album to scare away the mean reds."
2,Seemed like a good idea at the time...,"I've tried two of these; the first lasted over a year but keys began sticking and it became hard to push some of them. Because I liked the idea and it's SO hard to get white keyboards (which mine was), I just ordered another. Within less than two weeks it started doing the same thing, and some keys were just totally unresponsive.Sorry--it IS a great idea, but apparently not great craftsmanship."
4,Good Choice for Easy Viewing,"The reason I got this unit is that I replaced my old keyboard with a new one and did not realize the new one had incredibly small and dull letters on the keys. I am not a complete touch typist, and have to look at the keys often, and I type in the dark a lot. So, since I hated my new keyboard and had to replace it, I figured I would go all out and get this. It meets and exceeds my visual expectations.The touch is a bit clickety and the volume control does not have the minute (that's 'my newt') graduations I enjoyed on previous keyboards. Hence the loss of the fifth star. Still, it's a good buy."
5,Great sthort stories from a master of the craft!,"Grubb's best known for his great novel 'The Night Of The Hunter' but he could write fine short stories as well and this collection, out of print for more than 40 years, confirms that. Gentle fantasy tales and creepy ghost stories, all written with a master's care and love. You may not love all the stories in this collection but you won't forget a single one. What more can you ask for?"
3,Not so much a Jackie Chan movie...,"My lucky stars does not have much Jackie in it, but the parts he is in are great. The car chase at the begining and the funfair fight that follows are amazing, and the end fight scene is one of the best Jackie has ever done! The rest of the movie is done by the stars of the 'Lucky Stars' series. The cast are very talented, so the absence of Jackie is only noticable if you are a hardcore fan. An all round good film."
3,Good Comedy but lacking the jackie chan Spirit,"It starts out that Jackie is on a police mission and requires the help of his orphanage brothers, so the Hong Kong police commisioner blackmails the five brothers in to helping jackie since almost all were in the life of crime. The story unravles mostly in Japan. although a good flick its only worth it if youre a diehard Jackie Chan fan like myself,"
3,Product Description,"I have not read or played the book in question, but thought it would be helpful to include the product description on the page. The following is taken directly from the book itself:They lurk in the shadows, invisible to thepowerful and arrogant eyes of man.Nothing is too small to escape their notice.Silently, they lay their intricate, complexplans. Carefully, they place their rubber-bandcatapults. Tonight, the cheese will be theirs!Big Ears, Small Mouse is the American animationand comic supplement for the 2001 Origins Awardnominated RPG, Big Eyes, Small Mouth.

Thissourcebook features dozens of player characterspecies templates, guidelines for scaling combatbetween small and large opponents, customized mechaand personal gear for tiny creatures, and much more!"
5,Brutal and Fantastic,"Love the reviews and different suggestions for bands they have in the magazine. I like reading about the album reviews because it helps me get a view about new bands and bands I've never heard of before. Flexidiscs are cool if you have a player for them, nice add-on that makes this magazine unique. Basically if you like metal and lots of it, your $30 a year is safe with these guys."
5,DECIBEL IS SO COOL!!!,I love Decibel Magazine. It gives you all the latest updates of many hard core bands. it is the best thing ever!!! I love the site where you can earn points to win prizes. It is very much worth anyones time. SO SIGN UP FOR DECIBEL MAGAZINE!!!
4,Very good video narration,"Its not a cheesy gospel movie. I have seen my share of those. Also, because of its word for word narration, it gives the teens a video, an image, to go along with scripture. As a youth minister I found this move to be an excellent teaching tool. It has a tremendous effect on our group discussions."
3,The Gospel of John - Visual Bible,"I think that the movie follows scripture very well. I sat with my Bible NIV and followed along. The version used was not much different. Only placement of some of the words. Basicly it is scriptural. The one thing that I find in the film is the portrate of Jesus. Ian Cusac did a good job in his portral until it came to the exibition of his body. I don't think Jesus would have walked around with his chest completely exposed as the actor does. There are several scenes where the actors tunic is completly opened to the waist. People in that part of the country, then and now, wore robes and wraps to hide the body and I don't think Jesus would have been an exibitionist as portrayed in the movie. In that respect I was disappointed in the movie."
5,Incredible portrayal of Jesus.,"This high-quality production provides a close look into the life of Christ from the eye-witness testimony of the Apostle John. Not only does this film do a decent job of incorporating the culture and atmosphere of ancient Israel, it achieves a natural depiction of Jesus' personality and character by portraying him in the way the Gospel account describes. There are some geographical aspects of the film that are somewhat exaggerated (e.g., the Lake of Galilee appearing like the ocean front on the Oregon coast, elaborate housing structures in villages where Jesus walked). But the message is maintained and this film does an incredible job at incorporating realistic graphics of Herod's temple in Jerusalem, the rolling hills leading down from the Mount of Olives, and structure of the wall surrounding the temple.This film is entertaining, but can also be a great learning tool to visually relate to the Gospel of John."
1,So glad I didn't buy it,"I was really thinking of getting this video because I read all the accolades. A friend of mine had it so I borrowed it just to see it before I spent the money. I'm so grateful I did. This is just above the quality of a high school play. Wooden characters all around. The claymation life of Jesus , (the title escapes me but Ralph Fiennes is the voice of Jesus) is even much better than this. As someone said, get it at your library first before you go and waste your money."
2,Doesn't include what is advertised,"I purchased this specifically because it had French subtitles in order to show it in Haiti. However, once the DVD was loaded... no French subtitles were available. Disappointing..."
5,Simply Excellent,"This movie is like great, nutritious food for the soul. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and will enjoy it again. The actor who portrayed Jesus, did a great job. If you have not seen it, you should. If you love Jesus, I think you will love the movie."
5,Excellent Movie of the entire Book of John,"I think the company's name is the best description of this product -- ""Visual Bible"". The producers have portrayed a word-for-word visual expression of the Book of John. I loved it. My wife & I the first time had to stop this video several times to look at our Bible to see if they were twisting things, forgetting things, etc but they did a faithful representation. Highly recommended!!"
5,Transforms ride and handling,"Installed on my AWD Sienna with 90,000 miles, along with airbags. Made huge improvements loaded and unloaded. I installed them myself with hand tools. Highly reccomended."
3,Elmira St. CD review,"This Danny Gatton CD isn't his greatest - but I liked one track, Harlam Nocturne, and that was worth the cost of the CD."
5,"As always, Hillerman is the best!!!","This book was impossible to put down. It is yet another example of how subjects thoroughly researched can be of interest to more than just the author. Thank you, Mr. Hillerman."
4,End of Story?,"This may not be Hillermans best book, but it is certainly one of the saddest.Chee is back where he started, not knowing wahat to do with his life and his carreer.Leaphorn is still painfully bored and lonely. Moreover Hillerman is doing a lot of looking back and lets his protagonists reminisce whith him.Characters from earlier books reappear and time has not been friendly to them either. On the posiyive side Chee and Leaphorn finally come to a kind of understanding, but this more than anything makes me wonder if Hillerman could be wrapping up the series.There is a sad, autumnal beauty to this book, that makes it stand out from the other ones."
3,I like this guy,"The first editor or agent, I forget which, to read the first novel in Hillerman's long series of best-selling mysteries said to take out all the Navaho elements. How stupid is that? Meanwhile you've heard so much about Hillerman, and you're looking at the library or bookstore, and there's a big pile to choose from. Where do you begin? Chronology is one way, but you know he got better as he progressed, maybe had a slip or two, and whatever else befalls the author of a long-running series. So, where do you start? I recommend right here. If you enjoy this book, you'll know you can spend dozens or hundreds of hours with this author, just enjoying. That's a great feeling."
4,Hillerman's stories are always intriguing,"Being a resident of New Mexico, I can visualize the locations of the stories,as well as the attitudes and beliefs of the characters. Officer Chee and Joe Lephorn maintain their specific roles in each story."
3,Disappointed,"After years of excellent writing and character development, Hillerman left us hanging with a severe break in Leaphorn's character. To be charitable, perhaps he planned to work Leaphorn out of it in the next book, but he can't do that from the grave. Too bad."
4,a question of eagles,"I am very familiar with this series, so I expected to like this book, and I was not disappointed. The mystery was deliciously complicated, bringing together disperate threads that, finally, wove themselves into a very nice, logical web. I especially enjoy the background against which these stories are set, and the Navajo and Hopi cultures are far more than touches which make this series unique. In fact, they are a necessary part of the fabric of the story, and the foundations on which the main characters stand. This book was written in 1998, but it is in no way dated. Recommended."
3,Ok.........,"first of all, im not a huge breaks fan, but i listen to a good amount of breaks. i think this album is ok....but nothing really special. its more for the serious breakbeat fan. the highlights of this album are ""someone"" by ascension, ""red alert"" by dj laz, and ""take me higher"" by tony allen"
3,Average at Best,"I was excited for this CD when the single ""Shortie Like Mine"" was released. However, that's easily the best song on this album, and most of the other material is far below that level of quality. I'm a big fan of Jermaine Dupri's production, but most of the beats here are pedestrian and very similar to one another. The one beat by Nitti and JD, ""Don't Know Bout That"", is a nice break in the monotony (though not by a whole lot). The lyrics are the typical pop rap stuff...rims, jewelry, girls, etc. I usually don't mind that, but here it just sounds so worn out; there aren't really any clever twists or anything to keep your attention. Basically, you shouldn't pay more than a few bucks for this CD, and I'm being charitable giving this three stars...I'm hoping it'll grow on me a bit more."
1,Weak,"Bow ain't from da ATL he can't rap he's done hang it up, no respect here, wack is what we call him"
4,The Cure - Mixe Up,"This CD of remixes is very good although I'm not fond of discs with songs remixed. The melodies could even pass as originals if they knew them. Not too many repetitive, well-made production and quality. The songs become just dancing and without excesses. Fans should not fail to have this record that sounds good to the ears. Worth the risk! Note 8.5."
3,A little TOO mixed up,Great singles in the original form. These remixes pretty much ruin the beauty of the originals. Interesting for a Cure fanatic but not so much for everyone else.
2,Where's the 12th track?,"I bought this when it was a tape back in 1990. The tape has 12 songs and the CD for some reason is missing a song. ""Why can't I be you? (extended mix)"" hmm I wonder why its missing?"
4,i love the cure,"I really enjoyed the cd. it has alot of great songs remixed, and it sounds great. you should really pick this cd up if you like the cure!! **"
4,Very interesting,I loved the history that went along w/ the story. The initial start of the IRA was interesting. Something we never hear about so much. The Irish have come a long way and they don't blame everyone for it...
4,Scratchy for guest towels,"First, these are way too small to fit into a guest towel holder. They are definitely designed for a commercial on-the-wall holder. I rectified the situation for the time being by stacking some vertically behind the flat stack to provide a better fit. They also are interconnected so I had to first separate a stack of them to place in my holder.Next, they are very rough feeling. My paper towels in the kitchen are softer!We are converting to single use towels in all our bathrooms to avoid sharing a towel and the associated germs. I will use some of these for cleaning uses in addition to hand towels until they are used up. They will do for now, but will not reorder for home use. I gave them 4 stars because they are probably okay for a commercial use, but still could be softer."
1,"Rough, hard to hear & understand; Berlitz's WAY better!","Maybe I've been spoiled by Berlitz' immersion approach, but jumping back and forth between English and German was distracting. Also the recording quality wasn't good, the voices were unnecessarily harsh and unpleasant, and worst of all, the parts of the book that would have been the most useful to have recorded were only in the book."
1,Here I am to Worship,"I would like to say that I have enjoyed this CD. I was really looking forward to listening to it while doing house work. However, the CD must have come damaged. I knew it was used, however, it skipped so often that I could not listen to it. What have I learned? I will never buy another USED CD again. Linda W."
1,Bad Service - Missing Parts,"I received the Clamp Buddy but with a bracket missing. Contacted customer service who told me that one would be mailed to me. In a week and a half, they left me a voice message telling me that they were unable to send the bracket but I could order a new Clamp Buddy, remove the bracket, and then return the Clamp Buddy with the missing part. This has been a horrible first experience and I never want to do business with them again."
4,I dig this.,"I knew what I was getting when I picked this up, pretty much your standard random-members-band with random vocalists and Paul Di'Anno the man himself from the first two Maiden albums. This is good, not absolutely earth-shattering, but that's not the point of these things, as they are tributes by artists who love the band. I gotta say that so far, the Steve Grimmett tracks have to be my favorites, he even comes close to Bruce Dickinson's greatness at times. Di'Anno's, while great, seem to be lacking something in the delivery, but that just might be the fact that he's older than he was when he originally recorded them. Then there's Bernie Shaw singing ""Fear of the Dark"" which was great to me because I'm a huge Uriah Heep fan and he definitely brings some of that spirit to the song. All in all, a pretty standard tribute, definitely recommended to all Maiden fans!!!"
3,"Half good, half bad, but still worth a read","This is a great book in the spirit of the zombie short story collections from Skipp and Spector. The stories contained in this volume give a wide variety of related experiences in a world overrun by the living dead: the lucky and the unlucky, even some from the point of view of the shamblers themselves. One of the main things you get tired of is the repeated explanations that the media, in some form or another, had talked about the dead rising, but the protagonist doesn't believe it until they see the phenomenon for themselves. A few slow ones but overall a book that deserves to be up on the shelf with Skipp and Spector's Book of the Dead and the Mammoth Book of Zombies."
4,Missed some of the target,"Mr.Blustein did a fair job describing the strategies of the IMF in the troubled countries: however he did not go deep in the specific data on how the IMF and the patrticular countries ""spend,or invested the aid"" to solve their problems. Was the Malasyan Government successful in their policy to freeze foreign assets? Why? and How?He also neglected the Argentinian problem which was brewing during his writing. I saw it coming for a couple years. The IMf needs more flexibility to help countries who suffers from monetary and fiscal policies. Each one it is very peculiar and standard formula CAN NOT BE APPLIED to every country."
1,buyers beware,"Even though these filters are identified as ""SKUTTLE filter part #448-1"", they are not manufactured by Skuttle. Genuine Skuttle filters have 22 pleats; these generic filters only have 17."
1,Garbage,I bought a spindle of this brand. Most of them ended up as drink coasters because they would either not write correctly or wouldn't play.
3,Foot Wear,"I purchased this shoe because I loved the first Propet I purchased. This shoe doesn't feel as good as the first pair. Seems to be sized wrong, but I kept the shoe thinking I would get use to the different feel."
5,LOVE LOVE COMFORT,"I just had total knee replacement 3 weeks ago, second knee is in 4 weeks and wanted a pair of shoes supportive and easy to get into. I just received them and they feel amazing. Size is perfect fit-easy to slip on-great support and comfort. This is my second pair and I love them. Propet seems to be the most reasonable price point for the awesome quality."
3,Too big,"I really like the feel and look of these shoes, but they are at least a half size too big. I'll be sending them back and ordering a smaller pair."
2,Propet Slip on,The shoe is comfortable except that the right shoe rubs in the back. Maybe I should not have ordered a wide. I might have to put a lift in the right one. I was very surprised at how light it is. I will probably save it for more dressy wear since it is very attractive.
4,Wear A Lot!,"I purchase this shoe in white or white with the blue collar (size 7W) for work about every 10-12 months. I rotate the older shoes to yard work or donate. I have had one pair out of about 6 or 7 split open where the upper and sole meet at the ball of the foot. That surprised me but I had gotten plenty of wear out of it. I also own a pair of blue suede for jeans. Overall, I've been happy with them."
2,Wish I had kept the box to return them in...,"These shoes run large, and are not as comfortable as described. I wouldn't dare wear these for work. They are large/loose in height and length, but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box. I've bought much better, much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost.I like the color and texture of the material, but don't know how they will look & feel after washing. They look OK, but they feel cheap on my feet, and I won't buy another pair. I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren't, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes. I regret that I threw out the box and cannot return them. They are a waste of my money."
4,secure fit,"I bought these shoes for my disabled adult daughter. She has difficulty walking and requires a shoe with a secure fit and easy on and off as her motor skills are also limited. I'm hoping that with a bit of wear the shoes will relax a bit, but otherwise they are perfect for her needs. I also choose them because they are washable although I haven't yet attempted that."
1,not sized correctly,"I was so looking forward to wearing these shoes.But the heels were much too loose, and the shoe didn't fit properly around the ball of the foot.I walked in them for 5 minutes on my carpeted floors and decided that no additions or adjustments to the liners would make these shoes fit correctly."
3,propet,"My old propet's are like wearing slippers, these new ones are a little bigger and a little slippery. Hard for me to get used to, maybe they need a little breaking in."
4,They don't wash as well as I'd like.,"I bought these originally for my going out shoes. Something quick and easy to slip on that look good. They are comfortable, but not for all day on your feet kind of wearing. Add another cushion for that.They quickly became my work around the house and outdoor project shoes because they were so convenient to slip on and originally washed great. Now though, after about 3 washings the leather has cracked or crazed (I didn't dry them in the dryer) and they never wash up well enough to wear out again. I have 2 pair of the white with blue trim and a pair of the mushroom nubuck. The nubuck ones seem to wear and wash better.I know I will eventually be buying another pair - they are worth it."
1,poor build quality,"I've moved on from these long ago but I'd like to share my opinion on these. I picked these up at Costco for about 60 or so dollars last year and babied them. I properly burned them in, as advised from ilounge. They were great, and scratched the bass itch that grew from using shure's se210. Two months later however, the left side started failing, as if I blew the speaker. Mind you, my ipod's volume max is set at 1/3. Bad habit of mine for throwing away the packaging and I was stuck with broken headphones with no warranty. I went to bestbuy and picked up a pair of sony mdr-ex36v for $30 that peform better, costs less, has in-line volume control, and is reliable as my 20 year old 19 inch crt sony tv."
2,Not Recommended,"I do not recommend these headphones. Sure the sound is great, bit after owning these little buggers for a short while the wire started to short out. i had to use take to hole the wire in place near the jack for the ear pieces to work. If i didn't do that it stopped playing. I suggest you research more and buy something different."
2,Disappointed,"Sorry to say that I'm disappointed with these headphones. I have purchased headphones from V-Moda three times before and they've been 100% awesome. But these latest headphones, the cord is cheap and gets tangled very easily. Very irritating. I do not recommend."
2,"Owned 3 Pairs, ALL broke with under 5 Months of Use...But good sound","PEOPLE BEFORE YOU BUY A PAIR OF V MODA VIBES READ THIS!!!!!I have owned 3 pairs of V moda vibes. The first 2 were from the 1st generation. I lost the channel in 1 ear IN BOTH OF THEM after only 3-4 months of usage. This is because the bend of the wire eventually caused it to tear ( you could hear in both ears only when you bent the wire back at a specific angle)However the sound quality was really good for the price so I decided to give the 2nd gen a try when it came out. They had made the audio plug at an angle instead of straight like the 1st gen, so i thought that the problem was fixed....What do you know...4 months later, I lost sound again in the left ear....same problemFolks, the sound quality is great, they are super comfy...but they dont last.....I spend almost 300 dollars on these and they didnt last over a year."
1,Countdown,"We have bought 5 pair of these headphones. They should come with a countdown timer that shows you the product's life expectancy. If you are lucky, they will fail within warranty, otherwise you can be out for close to (or maybe more than) $100 after the one year coverage period. There is no exchange or repair alternatives offered, if they break, try using them for fishing. Problems noted include: volume failure or volume reduction in one or both sides or overall deterioration of the item itself. It would be nice to have this cosmetically appealing domestic product outperform a Chinese derivative that costs less than $25, but this is not the case. Never again from this company."
1,Nice product but it falls appart and gets stuck in your ear canal.,I purchased a set of these and after about 3 months a piece of steel mesh fell of and got stuck in my ear canal. All V Moda had to say was tuff and send them back for a replacement. you think that we should put this product in our ears?? That was 4 months ago. Since then i have heard nothing from them not even a phone call. Jesus they should be calling me. They have totally ignored the fact that the product failed big time and now i am out of pocket by a $100 and they have not sent me a replacement. DONT BOTHER WITH V MODA simply because they sell to you and then wave goodbye. I would not put any stars if there was a choice on the rate bar.
4,Good but not Great.,"I got these headphones as an ""upgrade"" to my skull candy titan headphones that i have had for about a year they were still going strong but hey i was looking for a new look in my headphones. so i went with these the red roxx from V-Moda, i have to say they are really cool looking but they lack sound quality its good but it sounds a little weak especially when you are listening to a song that you know has bass its just not their. If your looking for a good quality pair of headphones i would go with the skull candy titans which here on amazon are like half the price and are pretty good sound quality and are built to last."
1,Good sound but poor quality.,"The pair I got lasted about 4 months. While it lasted, the sound was good.And the isolation is ok, but not great.The problem is the wire connection to the earbuds is not strong enough.Gradually, one side started to become on and off, then both sides wereon and off. I had since thrown it into the trash can."
2,"Great Sound, If You Only Need Them For 2 Weeks.",Sounds great but will not last more then a few weeks. I have ben through 3 pairs of these and each pair the right ear bud has gone out and then they sound like trash. Waste of money.
3,Not a great product as i expected but okay,"it works okay for a year suddenly one earphone do not work. i am sorry about it, i hope that the connections or the wires are weak.it gave me great look in my ears and light weighted but disappointed."
2,Sub-par sound performance,"These in-ear phones seem fairly durable, and it is helpful that they fit the iPhone without modification. However, the sound quality is way below that of the Shure model at the same price point. I would not pick these over the Shure earphones again."
2,Read the Reviews!!!1!,"First of all if you're coming form Sennheiser's cx500's (like i did)I do not recommend these at all. These, in my opinion, are a downgrade.PROS:Looks; sharp & sleeksurprisingly good soundstagegood midrangeCONS:bloated Bassoverall tinny sound and weak highsfit & noise isolation (for me anyways)Overall I was very disappointed in these; with the raving reviews and all I was expecting something punchier or sharper I guess. Quality HAS dropped, my guess is that incarnations of the phones before the switch of manufacture (according to some reviews) sounded much better.BTW: I use .Rockbox on an 5.5g Ipod Video if that helps at all"
2,Great Earbuds with weakness in the wiring,"V-MODA Vibrato In-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone with 3-Button Apple Control (Black/Chrome).One of the best noise cancelling ear buds I have ever used.This is my second pair and the weakness is still present.The wires at the ear pieces and/or the plugs always seems tobreak internally where you would lose the sound from one or bothof the ear pieces. I treat these ear buds carefully and yetthe same failures results, poor wiring durability.You would be lucky if it fails during the warranty period butluck has nothing to do with it, more so with design & material used.Good sound but what the sense if you have to replace them often.The cost starts to add up over time.No sense in trying for a 3rd pair V-Moda ear buds again...Just throwing money down the drain. Try a different brand."
1,Stay away from the third party supplier of these terrific headsets,"These are wonderful, wonderful earbuds and I have had many of the other kinds. HOWEVER, they are shipped by a third party Z-Electria in Ashburn, Virginia who use a fourth party ""Liquiana"" to do their mailing. They do V-Moda a great disservice with their insulting refusal to provide a refund. They provide no RMA information for the product and they send it via USPS. When I saw that I had received the wrong product, I immediately ordered the right one from V-Moda via their website and returned the wrong ones via ""signature required"" USPS to Z-Electria. V-Moda responds immediately and I had the right earbuds in three days. On the other hand TWO MONTHS after I returned the original set to Z-Electria, they are still arguing about not making a refund and saying the earbuds were ""used"". This is terrible treatment. Fortunately, Amazon assures they will ensure a refund is obtained. Thank you Amazon."
2,Great sound - while it lasts.,"Folks, take the advice of one of the elder statesman in this group; only buy these ear buds if you have a high threshold for aggravation.The sound VModa achieves is outstanding, albeit a bit heavy on the bass, but, overall, the listening experience is WONDERFUL - *while it lasts*.I had these ear buds for less than 30 days before the left channel went dead on a long overseas flight; nothing to do but break out the book at that point.I'm looking for something else, right now. There are too many reported instances for this to be a chance occurrence."
2,Small and comfortable but lack quality and durability,"Bought these in February 2008. At $80, they were the second most expensive headphones/earbuds I'd purchased. They broke last month. The left earbud just stopped working. I'd used them frequently with my iPod but not every day. I never thought they had the quality to justify the price, and even at $65, I don't think they are worth it. They were comfortable and I liked that they were small enough to wear while sleeping. But again, the quality of sound never was great, merely adequate. They are certainly better than the ones that you get with your media player, but not high end at all, in my experience. I have a pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 Noise Cancelling headphones and you just can't beat the quality of sound these headphones provide. However, they are LARGE -- too large to wear outside or to bed at night. Thus the need for earbuds. I will not buy V-Moda again."
2,Good Sound - BADDDD Durability/1 Year Warranty?,"I used these a couple of days a week. However, I would always ensure they were properly wrapped up. Either way, the black casing on the ends started to retreat, exposing the wires. Now, they will not work at all. And what is worst, I have only had these a little more than a year, so the warranty is not good any more."
2,V-MODA Vibe Earbuds,"I have used earbuds and headphones extensively for years. I found these to be well made, sized well and comfortable. The sound quality is good but so bass bias it sounded very unnatural listening to my IPOD. I returned them to Amazon and received a prompt refund."
4,headset sound quality,"I was so happy in the day I recieved the headset but so dissapointed when pluged it and heared the sound it is abnormal very low quality even I thought something wrong with my handset for that I changed it with another one but the sound quality was less than low(bad) even it is harmful to the ears,I couldn't hear the bass and the strange thing the sound looks like distorted and oes contains some disturbing eco,but still the shape of the headphone is very good but never can use it for hearing songs,if you gonna buy one of these you can use it just to say I have a headphone never to hear music with.so dissapointing and I can't say it is bad I wish there is another word wors than worse to describe the sound quality"
2,"Great sounds, terrible durability","These earbuds took a little getting used to, as the fit doesn't always hold. I used the smallest of the gel earpieces and they still popped out a lot. The sound, however, is amazing! I use them primarily at work to listen to books and drown out my coworkers. They made me feel like I was sitting down with the reader. They don't last, however, less than 5 months and they are already broken beyond repair. No good!! The sounds is awesome, but they aren't worth it unless you have $100 to throw away every couple months."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"These are extremely overpriced earbus. I have had 2 sets, on replaced under warranty and they both broke. I am really carefull abou them the sound is just so-so. Better bass that most but Female Vocals and piano sounds are just terrible- they can just a lot of boom boom and completely-un-HiFi tunes. They both broke at the jack, and there is a lot of cable rustling - there are others that are a lot better. I have had Bose Tri-ports, for Jazz Classical and Vocals -excellent. These are just Volume brain blasters. If you want your brain fried, these are it. But it won't hold up for long."
1,Buyer Beware!!,As reported by a number of other reviewers these headphones are not at all durable. Mine broke after just over a year of very gentle use. The coating around the wire disintegrated and they are no longer usable. Since there is only a 1-year warranty I do not have the option of replacing them.
2,Good sound but it won't last you 3 months,"I've been through two of these in the past 6 months. I listen to my ipod very often and these offer good sound, but the headphones started deteriorating in sound until the music sounded like it was coming from a different room. Something about the way this was built causes the circuitry to come loose, so eventually you have to twist and turn the cord to hear the proper sound. This isn't something you should have to deal with. Get a more sturdy pair and you'll save money in the long run."
4,awesome,"I love this can! When you have your hands full just stand in front and it opens.Every one that comes over thinks it's the coolest thing to have.We put batteries in it and so far they are still going strong, haven't had to change them yet. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Try a different product,This trash can broke down after just 2 months..the lid did not open. When I contacted the manufacture I was given the run around and then told that if I wanted a replacement that I would have to pay for the shipping (to and from) the manufacturer for the part ($25.00+). Save you time and money and look at a different brand.BT
2,Touch Free stainless trash can,"this trash cans motor does not last very long, thought it was the battery, but it was not...lasted about a year"
1,Good in principle - bad experience,"Maybe this is just my experience... I certainly hope so.I found this trash can because it was actually cheaper than comparable step-cans. About a week after using it, it stopped working. I assumed the batteries had just run out so I specially ordered rechargeable D batteries and a specialty D battery charger. It still didn't work.Then, my boyfriend had the horrific experience of finding the entire inside of the lid of the trash can COVERED IN MAGGOTS. Yes. Tiny white worms. Gross. We assumed they must be fruit fly larvae since we had seen a few (only a few!) in the past couple of days.I don't know if it's something about the charcoal system that allowed them to nest inside there or what, but it was terrible.Needless to say, it is basically now just a regular trash can that we have to lift the top to to put our trash in. No charcoal. No electricity.Kind of a bummer."
1,Worked for about 8 months,"After 8 months the lid would open and shut every 5 seconds. Per the customer service recs, I cleaned the sensor, changed the batteries, and left it without power for over 6 hours. Did work.They want me to send it back to them for repairs BUT I must pay shipping both ways. No good. Will not buy another from this company."
1,A mind of its own after five months of use,It was alright at first. Now the lid will open at its own will or not at all even two set of new batteries were changed.
3,Don't get if you have kids or have a lot of guests - update a few years later,"I really like this because I can run from the sink to the trash with drippy stuff and it opens and I don't have to open anything with my hands full. However, a lot of our friends have kids and our guests can't seem to figure it out. We've been through three of them because the lid breaks when people try to manually open the lid. It's kind of expensive to have that breaking so often. Even so, I'm going to keep getting them, I just wish they would make a better lid and that replacement lids did not cost as much as buying a whole new package.Update: Nothing changed about the above review. The third can broke too. I've since switched to the simple human step can with a quite closing lid and love it."
5,It's terrific !!!!!!!!,I love the ease of using my new garbage can. It is so easy and clean. I love it. If for any reason it will not open I have the option of a manual open and close which also allows you to leave it open should you wish. The price was right also. I have told everyone who comes over that they need to get one.
5,"Works good, except the cover gear broke","It looks great, functions properly, and is space saving. The bag holder is somewhat difficult to use but it works. We'll see if it lasts.Update: 7 months of use later and I just replaced the four D cell batteries. As long as you keep the sensor area clean, it works with no problems.Update 2: After about two years of use, the cover gear broke off of the cover, rendering the unit useless. I bought a replace cover from iTouchless for $40. The new one looks like they improved the gear, and the cover doesn't slam as hard closed.I like the unit, hopefully the new cover unit will work longer."
4,Great Touchless Can,"We purchased the trash can 4/9/10 and have been using it for about a month now. We have had zero problems with the lid opening/closing as it should. The trash bag stays secure and is hidden neatly away.The only complaint I have; the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it had two dents on the side of the can when we pulled it out of the box. I was able to push one out, but the other is still there. (not really a big deal since that side faces the wall). However, if it wasn't I would have returned the trash can for a new one.Great can for the price and stays clean f fingerprints because you're not having to touch it!"
1,Sucks,So doesn't work. Stopped working shortly after buying. Hard to get to open other than pushing open button. Waving hand in front when your hands are full defeats the purpose.
1,This garbage can is GARBAGE,"Length:: 1:07 MinsLook - this thing doesn't work anymore. This claim, ""if you open your can 20 times a day, it can last over 10 years. This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time."" is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product."
2,The lid stopped working within 6 months.,"After comparing step cans and prices at Wal-Mart, Kohls, Amazon and eBay, I found this can for $35 at Costco and went for it. We all loved it, it was so convenient! The infrared sensor was iffy, sometimes it doesn't respond, but I had no problem pushing the open button, which worked fine to me. After 6 months though, the lid won't open either with the open button or the infrared sensor. Fresh batteries notwithstanding, I have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it. Sure, the close button still works, but shouldn't I expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage?Thank goodness I bought this at Costco, I can return it for a full refund even after 6 months. I'm going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the $10 of batteries altogether. Good idea, but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end."
1,Motor and sensor stinks,"For the first couple months, the lid worked great. The sensor was a little too sensitive to movement, so we had to move it closer to the corner away from foot traffic.However, after a couple months, the sensor doesn't work at all. We now have to push the manual open button. Also, the lid doesn't stay open when you try the ""stay open"" button push. The motor seems to have given out and can't hold the lid open for more than a few seconds. Even with fresh batteries, the problem doesn't go away.We should have bought the step on lid opener... and so should you."
2,lid stopped working,Good quality garbage can but the lid stopped working after about 2 months.Its pretty much useless with out the automatic lid.I'll most likely not be buying this one again...
3,The cost to replace the lid within warranty period is $16 + $ 9.95 after working for 11 months.,"The lid stopped working after 11 months since purchase.The cost for replacement is more than I expected.Buying a new trash can would cost me more, so.....I decided to do it.For about 2 weeks, I had no lid for my trash can.The whole process is not super fast, but it was during holiday season.Therefore, it is fine for me.Here is the procedure to have a replacement of the lid.1. Call the customer service.2. Receive Warranty service request form in email.3. Send a copy of the receipt to the warranty department by email.4. The warranty department will reply within two business days.5. Once get the reply, send the product back within 30 days.6. I sent the lid by USPS, around $16.7. Include a $9.95 check to cover the return shipping and handling."
1,Piece of junk!,"I purchased this due to the majority of good reviews; however, when it arrived and immediately out of the box, the lid only opened maybe 30% of the way automatically, and about 50% of the time wouldn't close all the way. Was very disappointed in the overall quality of everything - it is made with what must be the cheapest of materials all around. It's luck of the draw whether you get one that actually works - and in my case even if I did get one that works, I wouldn't be confident at all in it lasting a very long time. I'd gladly pay $100+ for a quality touchless trash can - but it seems looking at both this model, as well as others, they seem to be all cheaply made."
4,Useful item for seniors,"I bought this for my parents to replace the ""step-on"" kitchen trashcan they were using. My father's balance isn't as good these days, and with this unit he doesn't have to balance on one foot while pushing a pedal with the other.They put their trashcan in a busy location next to the kitchen island, but the 6-inch range for the sensor is apparently just right since they haven't many problems with accidentally triggering it when they walk by. My mother particularly likes the button that keeps the can open manually while she scrapes the dinner plates - then she puts it back on auto for the rest of the day.This item definitely has a convenient feature. The only tradeoff I can see is a little additional work involved in replacing the bags."
1,Waste of battery,I ordered this product bec. I need to change a new one. But when i got it. I changed my mind bec. of the wastefull battery operated infrared feature. And the top cover is very sensitive and fragile. Looks like it will break when you are not carefull. Another thing no plastic container with handle inside to sanitize your hands when your unloading. I rather pick a step on with container since it comes with the same feature I like. This product is a waste not a smart choice.
1,It Looks sturdy on the picture but really is not!!,This garbage can is not as durable than I thought. I had one purchase from costco and it's alot cheaper than this one and it lasted for four years. Still works but kind a want a new one. After doing my research I found this garbage can with a good rating and thouht give it a try. But very disappointed. The garbage can material is so cheap. The sensor does not work all the time. I have to turn on and off the switch all the time and it's really annoying. Overall this garbage can it not worth it!!!
4,Trash can review,"I had purchased the same trashcan at Costco for much cheaper price. The lid gear mechanism is what breaks and is very flemsy. I contacted the manufacturer to purchase only the lid mechanism as the rest was ok. However, they do not provide parts for the lid and one has to purchase the entire lid for much higher prices than purchasing a whole new trashcan which includes the lid of course.That is what I did. the product is good. But, I wish the manufacturer would have local repair shops or provide parts to be purchased. Also if the manufacturer would think of a better gear that can be replaced would be appreciated.Cheers!!!"
4,Touchless Trash Can,"Item was as described. Great product and a good price compared to other local and online retailers.The only problem we have is...our little dog does not like it...every time we head to the trash can, she runs out of the room, and returns after the lid closes. Maybe she will get used to it. Have already recommended this product to others."
2,"was fantastic, until it stopped working","I LOVED this garbage can. No mess, no smells, easy to use with your hands full.Then, it broke, after just a few months. The lid stayed permanently open. We cleaned it, changed batteries, but the lid simply no longer functions.Yes, it is still under warranty, but we bought for far less than the price here, and it does not seem worth the money and effort to ship the lid back. I have a feeling it would just going to break again. I'd be furious if I paid anything close to what it is listed for now (nearly $100)."
5,Excellent Product!,"Excellent product, excellent price! In addition, would like to thank Amazon for prompt response to our complaint regarding the original shipment: the first item we ordered arrived with multiple dents on the sides, but after we contacted Amazon we've been taken care of immediately. Our replacement item arrived the next day and the same UPS truck picked up the damaged item - WHAT A SERVICE!!!"
3,touchless stainless stell hands free trash can,"We love it, but it a tad to sensitive. When we walk by, it opens, and uses a lot of batteries. Otherwise it's a great product."
4,Slightly troublesome to change the liner,"I like everything about this product except one small flaw. In order to put in a new liner you have to fit the top edge of the plastic liner around a removable springy hoop. The springy hoop fits snugly along an inverted ridge molded into the inside of the can. When you do it correctly the bag is contained completely within the can with no exposed edge, and the bag does not slide down along the inside of the can, no matter how much you overload it. This part is brilliant and works great.However the actual mechanics of putting the bag on the hoop and then getting the hoop lodged into the proper position in the can is a bit awkward. My wife complains about it and so I'm the one who always has to change the bag. With practice I've got it down to a quick and smooth procedure, but any sort of learning curve associated with a trash bin is problematic."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a breeze--it stays clean, hands stay clean, battery lasts---best trash can I have EVER had--"
4,Nice Trash Can,"After reading several reviews, I decided to order this touchless trash can and I really like it. It's not as big as I'd like it to be and it is a bit sensitive, but it works for me."
4,Pretty good,Can does open when you walk by it sometimes. my one year old loves to trow things away (this is not a good thing because I do not want them in the garbage) My older child does fine with it. It does open when you want to throw garbage away
1,The battery cover didn't fit,"I could no way close the battery cover. So I duck-taped it to hold the baerries. But the batteries were too heavy and they became loose and pushed the cover down into the can. This apparently happened when I emptied the can for the first time. (I ordered this on 1/14/2010.) Sometime after that I realized it stopped working, and found that the cover was permanently lost (to the town dump). I duck-taped the batteries directly into the slot, but after a few hours (maybe a few minutes?) the tape could no longer hold the heavy weight of 4 D-batteries, and became loose. So the trash can is totally useless. Had I bought this from Costco, I would take it to the store and they would refund me. But unfortunately I bought it through amazon.com (I had also threw away the box.) I'll just have to throw this trash can into my trash bin to go to the town trash tump. What a trash product it is. If amazon.com keeps selling products like this it will become a trash company as well."
2,iTouchless Stainless-Steel Hands-Free 13-Gallon Infrared Automatic Trash Can,"It took three attempts to finally get this product in the condition it was supposed to be in. The first two trash cans i received had large dents in the fronts of the cans. The boxes they came in had been punctured. Had to contact Amazon several times to get this problem solved. Other than that no issues with the last trash can, it is in acceptable condition. It has a dent in it as well, but it is minor. The Amazon Service Department was contacted regarding the dented trash cans, they responded promptly."
4,Excellent Battery Life,Length:: 0:10 MinsWe have been using this trash can for over 5 months with no problems and with the same batteries! This can is in a busy area and gets triggered to open several times every day. The only negative thing I have to say is changing the bags in it could be better: you have a plastic hoop that the bag goes around then you must fit it into the can..kind of a hassle.****UPDATE*****Still the same batteries for a little over a year now!This video clip is of the trash can after a year of family use.
4,automatic trash can,I purchased another like product about 2 years ago. It cost more and lost its electronic use. This Hands free 13 Gallon automatic trash can works well. I like its response and the cost was less than the one I purchased before. I wholly endorse this product.
2,Not Durable,"I will keep it simple. It works great. It looks great. This is the second one we have owned. Both have failed prematurely as the gear mechanism that opens the lid is less than a quarter inch wide and made of plastic. Each time it has failed the gear (i.e., snaps). The last trash can lasted 7 months. We are going to buy a step operated can next. The step trash can is more money but a ten year warranty. It is also cheaper in the long run. Take it from two engineers (wife and I), this is not a durable design. The Achilles heel is the tiny gear. Then the whole thing is trash (pun intended)!"
5,GREAT Value!,"I purchased 2 of these cans almost 3 years ago, and they have held up MUCH better than I expected. I run a daycare out of my home, and the kids are constantly pressing the buttons to open and close them, and it wasn't until yesterday that one actually broke beyond repair. The batteries last an incredibly long time- almost a year- and they are cheaper than most other stainless cans.You just can't lose with these!"
4,"Works as promised, but a little clumbsy to work with.","I am happy with the product. It works exactly as promised and it seems to be a well made item.The only difficulty I've had is wrapping the bag around the rather flimsy plastic insert sleeve. This insert doesn't always sit as it is supposed to....so you just have to spend a couple minutes re-wrapping the bag. Annoying, but still better than most cheap plastic cans I've used."
5,Great trash can,"This product is awesome. I had one that after 10 years bit the dust, so this one is a replacement. But the beautiful thing is that this one has a filter to help keep the smells at bay. The touch less part works great. So happy I got this!!"
2,"cool, conversation starter but really is annoying","The other reviewer's right - it's too sensitive at times (opens when anyone walks within 1 ft), but when you need it to open, it won't. It also just stops working at least once a day, neccessitating resetting it - too much of a hassle for something that everyone uses everydayI'm returning mine (which I bought for $53 during their 1 day sale, plus $20 credit with $79.99 purchase) - glad Amazon's customer service is great - they'd pay for return shipping. I'd stick with my original foot pedal trash can, it does the same thing - only less annoying, cheaper to operate (no batteries) & cheaper period. Reviewed by ebay's filipinagoddess"
5,Very Satisfied,We are very happy with the iTouchless Automatic Trash Can. It's stylish and operates quietly. It arrived quickly with plenty of protective packaging (so no dents). We've not had the problem some reviewers mention of the top coming up randomly. I would recommend this product without reservation to others interested in upgrading their trash receptacles.
1,Stopped working!,The lid on this trashcan stopped working. I only ordered it on December 17. It won't even open for me to put trash into. I can't easily get a hold of the manufacturer. If I do I will update this review.
3,Fair but forgetable,"Decent first attempt, overall this music doesn't stand apart from everything else on the market.Worthy of a few plays this CD quickly found its way into a box with all the other music that doesn't stand out enough to remain in rotation.Lyrically about half the CD is good and the rest just doesn't wow."
4,Excellent cd (minus track 4),"I've only vaguely listened to photek before this album, so Im coming at it from a different perspective than the rest of the hardcore fans. I really do like this cd. The first track is quite excellent, very different than alot of the generic crap floating around lately. track 2 is equally as good, and #3 could very easily be my favortie song on the disc...haunting vocals, driving beats, pulsing synths, and all arranged masterfully. Track 4???? AWFUL. I really dont like ANYTHING about this track (music is mediocre, vocals are terrible). Track 5 is cool, but I feel the crap male-house vocals ruin it. From hear on out the disc is a smooth ride covering many styles, yet keeping the same deep, dark, photek-tone (that i know of). I really like this disc, always sounds new."
4,Photek Solaris,"Comparing this to ""Form and Function"" is quite a big jump, but never the less the Photek soul is still visible. I wasn't all into diva singing...I almost regretted buying the CD completely, especially when I discovered the next track had the same deal once again. But I gave it another chance and they grew on me, and before I even realized I was singing along! Along with all the uniquely developed sounds, the song order rolls on very nicely. It beings quite chaotic, but positive, then aims towards love, gets aggressive, then very glum. People that don't like this CD are shying away from Photeks experimentation that's executed extremely well."
5,Good Artist,Photek is a good producer. If you only give him 3 stars- you are a moron. He has a true vision. A lot of thought went behind this album. He deserves 5.
2,Moyo Madness,"I've always enjoyed Keiko Matsui's jazz interpretations, but something got lost in translation on this one. Too out-of-touch for my tastes."
1,Don't waste your time with this one,"British authors Ferris and Bassett make sophomoric remarks and observations while traveling through several European countries. This is supposed to be humorous (and if you don't 'get' their juvenile brand of humor, why, that must be because you are American). The book is filled with little jabs at Americans, and one can only be left wondering why these Brits feel themselves to be so superior to the Americans and others they encounter on their travels. Surely it can't be due to their sense of humor or writing ability, which is junior-high level at best."
4,Stopped too soon,"Good history, great pictures, good section on care and restoration. Unfortunately for me, I have come into old sewing machines at the Singer 66 Red Eye point, and the Encyclopedia stops before it gets to those machines. The same is true for the Memphis models.(Could be that the ""100 years old = antique"" rule has been applied.)"
3,cheap batteries,They drain pretty quickly. I guess with batteries you get what you pay for. Besides that there's nothing really wrong with them.
4,Not as good as 1 and 3,But still a great CD! If God played the electric guitar I think Torben is as close as any human can come to it.
1,Not what I thought,This is not what I was looking for I was looking for only that only had audio not audio and Mic
4,tool is fine quality,"tool is fine quality. manufacturer spent a lot of effort making a tool case for the tool but it fell apart right away. again, tool works fine and compares with cheap harbor freight equivalent, etc."
2,Not for larger dive watches,"The tool itself seems just fine,and I like the idea of the 3 prongs, but it will not open large enough to fit the back of my Casio dive watch, which is the watch I bought it for. I'm having to buy one of those tools that just has two prongs, since that's what I've seen several jewelers use. If this one would open another 1/16th of an inch, it would have worked well, I'm sure."
2,Not So Good,"Got this to replace batteries, but it took so long and was such a hassle to take the back off my watch that I was ready to take my watch back to the shop and pay the $10 for them to replace the battery. Then the prongs kept falling out as I was trying to take the watch back off. The tightener threading is not smooth making it difficult to tighten or loosen the tongs. I bought the cheapest one and am now regretting having done so."
4,"SE Watch Case Wrench, Adjustable","This is very early days. So far I have not had a great deal of use for this tool but with all the various pins and adjustments it is proving very useful. Time will be the judge.SE Watch Case Wrench, Adjustable"
3,Good deal,This is not a high quality tool. But it is a Fair quality device for the price.It worked fine and it was delivered fast.
2,Only For a True Fan,"Take the marginal studio quality of Wishing Chair and then strip all the good songs and you have Hope Chest. This is a meandering collection of outtakes from a band that really did not have a long enough career to give them the right to such a fiasco. This stuff belongs on disc 9 of a box set. This is one for true fans only - people that lie awake all night wishing the band would get back together. This is their only hope, but if you have the choice, this band have put out some great stuff. Listen to that first."
4,Doesn't clean up as well as I'd hoped,"I got this pan because the Le Creuset cast iron stuff cleans up in a jiffy.The stoneware doesn't clean up as well. In fact, I used it to cook a roast and it was hard to clean. This is odd because I cook roasts in tin foil so very little gets on the pan. Maybe the dirt was left over from Thanksgiving when I made stuffed artichoke bottoms. My dishwashers then were probably a little tired. Still I like this baking pan. It's a convenient size and works well."
2,this is the best they could do?,"""purr la perla"" is an excellent song, but the other three tracks here are thoroughly weak, just barely passable as b-sides. As a massive Cocteau Twins fan who found Mono tolerable, I was hoping for much more, but it seems that Mr. Guthrie has lowered his standards tremendously. This stuff sounds like the barely-thought-out too-simple toss-offs that mar the Twins' final few albums. Innovative it ain't."
3,WHERE IS MY DVD? Why is it not here?,"I bought this and never received it. It said it was delivered, I was around all day and never received it. I would really like to write a review about this product but cannot. Where is my DVD amazon? where is it?"
4,AN INTERESTING READ,"I FOUND THIS BOOK EASY TO READ LIKE MOST OF THE BOOKS I HAVE READ ABOUT SEALS AND FOUND IT INTERESTING AS WELL. AS A YOUNG SEAL ENTHUSIAST I FIND IT INTERESTING TO READ ABOUT OUR COUNTRY'S GREATEST FIGHTERS DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST. BECAUSE I HAVE READ FACTUAL BOOKS ABOUT THE SEALS, I FOUND THIS TO BE BASED ON FACT AND A GOOD READ FOR ANY SEAL ENTHUSIAST."
5,On D. Morris' human fidelity conclusions.,"This book has been a great eye opener for me. It described so many things that we always take for granted in the woman-man relationship. At sertain points it had helped me to better understand those men I meet.But the book raises the eternal question of the fidelity of the sexes and how to keep a relationship together. D. Morris suggests that the bond between a woman and a man has to be strong but should be able to break in times of emegency. Morris explains this in terms of the sad loss of a reproductive individual if his partner dies. But I believe that this explanation is not complete.As Morris often compares human behaviour to animal behaviour, I wonder why this problem of 'bond -breaking' does not excist in certain animal species? (They make life long pairs and still do not look for new partners even after the death of their own. Hence these animals 'loose' their genes.)"
2,"Social ""biology"" strikes again","What a mysoginistic, narrow perspective. Some of his ""observations"" are [very] loosely based in science, but I was offended by his sweeping observational generalizations and gross stereotypes being presented in such an authoritative manner. The uncritical reader might accept his musings as a scholarly,scientific discussion of the current body of sex and gender knowledge. However, his writing is actually a loose interpretation of others' scholarly work (whose, we don't know as the references are uncited) viewed through a very male-dominant culture-status-quo lens."
3,ERR 4,I bought this product because I loved many things about it. I was very dissapointed when after only 4 months it quit working with what KitchenAid called an internal error. They replaced it quickly and the new one quit working with the same error in only 3 days. I called again for a replacement and they are upgrading to a newer model.
3,cute but overpriced,What do you do when the batteries run out? Nothing. These are SO CUTE but SO OVERPRICED!!
2,sounds don't work,i find this product to be lovely. i bought it some months ago for my baby and put it away until now that he is 7 months and we can play with it.but i just found out that the sounds of the bottom 2 rings don't work!! i am so pissed off!!! this is such a pity.
3,Benita Valente is an amazing singer,"Even though I have only been studying voice for a short time I can appreciate what an outstanding singer and performer Benita Valente is. I am in awe of her ability to create a dramatic yet sensitive vocal line. My favorite recording of her is Libby Larson's Songs From Letters. She is the wonderful thing about this CD!! I know that often one thinks of Dawn Upshaw, Kiri Te Kanawa, Renee Fleming, etc. as leaders of today's classical vocal recordings. After hearing Ms. Valente on any recordng she will be added to your list without hesitation."
5,How to read rhythms better!,"Pat Petrillo is a gifted educator....and this DVD is the real thing. How to read, had me thinking and playing in a place that would have been tough to find, had it not been for and the information he shares on this DVD."
5,The right book for the right job,This book is amazing for anyone really who want to improve their abilities at reading rhythms. It was not only a great refresher for me it took me beyond my abilities and brought growth from working it out. Thanks to Pat's book and DVD you can get right into it and have great improvement. This is a stellar book for young or old. I love it!!!!Thanks again Pat for all your input in the drumming community.Jim
5,Very happy with these for my purpose,"I purchased this set of stainless steel pots for soapmaking, and they are perfect. If I would have been buying them for cooking, I most certainly would have purchased a more expensive set. These are not thick, heavy pans, but they are great for my purpose. The lids don't all fit perfectly, they may dent if you bang them on something. I think for soapmaking or just boiling pasta, these work great. If you are going to buy these for overall cooking use, you will probably not be happy with them - in that case, spend more than this to get a nice thick set of pots. :)"
1,Stock Pots,"I love the concept, however I bought this because I do a lot of high volume cooking for family and church. I love the pots, except I noticed that they began to rust on the interior around the bolts, which is definitely not good as this can cause a severe health hazard to your foods. This definitely needs to be addressed and fixed as no one needs to be spending this type of money for a product that can potentially cause rust in your foods."
5,Awesome Board,"I had this board before but I lost it to the sea. For the price it works super good. It is light weight and thin. The only problem that I had with it was the size. I am 5'8"" 167lbs. and the board is not big enough to carry me out as far as I want to go. If Body Glove made the board a few inches longer than I would not even think about buying an Exile skimboard."
4,Not as good as the Mammy,"I enjoyed this book, as well as the rich characters some new some old. I still think the Mammy was the best out of the three!"
5,"Fantastic, BUY IT!","Had this on tape in 1997 and missed it so I replaced it with a CD. It is a classic by a group of fantastic musicians and vocalists. I love this CD, BUY IT!"
1,"Poor content, bad presentation","The movie itself is very run of the mill and humdrum.The video quality is slightly woolly and there are no subtitles or captions on the disc, so very poorly presented from a technical and accessibility standpoint."
5,Excellent Milwaukee,"I have used Milwaukee products for many years, with excellent results. This charger was up to expectations, excellent.Bruno Notari"
5,Spellbinding! Excellent account of a Lucchese victory!,"This book nicely illustrates the powerful ways in which the modern mafia operates. It is an accurate account of how such an omnipotent organization avoids confrontations with the Feds, as well as ultimate prosecution. It is a gratifying, realistic and at times humorous book. It makes us come to the realization that the world is not what many have idealized it to be. With power, anyone can be a leader. This book is a MUST READ for anyone interested in modern organized crime!"
2,A book only the author's mother could love,"The people who gave this book a five star rating must be related to the author -- or maybe its the author himself. Honestly, as someone who has read almost every mafia book out there, this book is just so so. People should know that it focuses almost all of its attention on the New Jersey court case and not on the street action. Its more about lawyers and the justice system than it is about criminals and the street."
4,great product.,"when you live in an apartment that has no venting for a dryer, this is the answer to a prayer. It is easy to install, easy to use and saves me from the laundromat!!!!"
3,Cheap in almost every way,"Length:: 0:13 MinsThis is not worth the $10.70 I paid for it. The hose is not the advertised 5'. It is 3'4"". the rest of the product is a simple plastic tub for holding water. All held together with plastic ties. Save your $ and make one of these at home for a %90 discount.Addition on 10/28/2010. After complaining directly to the company I was offered, and received, a replacement with the correct hose. The product works much better now. Rating revised to reflect superior service."
4,good product,If you have to vent into a bucket this is the way to go. Just put a knee high stocking around it to keep lint from flying out
1,disappointment,"I have had trouble with a basement dryer vent. After catching on fire, I decided to buy this indoor dryer vent kit. Yes, it's inexpensive, and technically does what it's supposed to do... It's flimsy, allows moisture to saturate the wall and floor, but worst of all it allows lint to accumulate all over the room. I put a mesh bag around it to try to stop the lint from flying out, but it still escapes. Messy, flimsy and heading for a moldy disaster soon. Save your few dollars and invest in something with more filtering capabilities (if it's out there). I am looking."
3,Average Construction Material,The vent arrived quickly and works relatively well. I would have preferred that it be more quality construction even if it was more expensive. We installed it just a few days ago and time will tell how it works over time.
3,lent everywhere,i would have been just as well off to have just put a stocking over the vent tubing and let it blow inside. this thing doesnt do a very good job of catching any lint you would be better off with a unit like i have seen before that you can flip a damper for summer to let it vent outside. i will put some kind of filter in this to catch the excess lint
3,"Good video, not the best","I bought many newborn care DVD's and this okay but it is not my favorite. It has alright content for first time parents, but it drags on a lot. I still prefer (Starting Out Safe and Sound: A Guide to Newborn Care and Safety) which has more concrete information on newborn care and safety."
1,Not as shown or referenced.,Ring design does not go all the way around. Not shown or referenced. Misleading and they only offer refund of purchase - not a correction or providing ring as advertised. Beware!! Most likely other ring designs too do not go all the way around.
1,A waste of money,I've lived 52 years and this is the worst book I've ever read. It has spelling errors and misuse of the English language on every other page. The book is double spaced so it's actually half a book. All this could have been forgiven if it had an interesting story to tell - it didn't. I spent $25 on this book and am writing this review to keep others from wasting their money. I ended up throwing it out - something I've never done with a book. Didn't anyone edit this book????
1,Short life span,"As others have noted, it is an excellent gauge which lasted around a year. Ridiculous. Replacing with a mechanical gauge. Roadgear is a company I shall not order from again..."
3,Comfortable but oversized,"I'm generally an 11 or 11.5 when it comes to shoe size, but based on these slippers I must be a bit smaller. I purchased the ""large"" size which is said to fit sizes 10.5-11.5 but unfortunately the slipper is much too big. The back of the slipper slips off the back of my foot constantly. Aside from this small annoyance, they are very comfortable and sturdy. Buy smaller than your actual shoe size and you should be quite satisfied with your purchase."
3,Memorable Read,"I read this book some time ago but I can still remember it. I read a lot, so that's a feat for me and for the book. There is a lot of texture to this story and it's well told. The writing is very good and story takes you on a journey that's memorable. Worth reading."
3,magnetic dress up dolls,My granddaughters love this product. They play with them pretty often. The reason I rated it 3 for overall is because I think the magnetic dolls/clothes should be a little stronger. The clothes don't hold onto the dolls very well.
4,Sloan for tone!,"This is my first intro to Sloan. Being a huge BEatle fan, I dig sloan. They have a very power pop vibe. Good songs, great guitar tones, nice vocals, great melodies. I also like the fact that they all four sing lead.Being a singer/songwriter myself, I really appreciate good work. My hat's off to you all. I have just ordered two more Sloan cd's!!-jp"
4,Fantasticly beautiful,"On ""Once Again"" John Legend provides vocals as seductive as Sade, as masculine as Barry White, and as sensitive as Al Green. This soulful album deserves to be in anyone's collection who admires quality tunes by contemporary artists who keep the future of Soul music alive."
4,interesting CD,"this CD has influences of motown combined with hip hop neo-soul. I especially like the songs will.i.am wrote and if this is the type of stuff he is writing for michael jackson's upcoming album, I can't wait!!!"
1,Vey Disappointed,"I was very disppointed in John Legend's second CD, ""Once Again"". I consider myself a JL fan after his exceptional first CD, ""Get Lifted"", but his second try just doesn't work for me. The entire CD has a lounge act sound to it, and none of the tracks are memorable at all. Overall, I would recommend saving your money and not wasting it in this one."
3,A legend in the making,"There are always problems with a sophamore CD. The biggest problem with ONCE AGAIN is GET LIFTED...after that stunning CD, this was a hard act to follow and it did not quite make it. Mr Legend is, after collaborations with Kanye West, Sergio Mendes and his contribution to the Luther tribute album, this low profiled man had us all aquiver with anticipation, there are no collaborations here however. In the main this seems to be contemplative and personal. A man and his piano, apparently obsessed with Maxine. An honest and sweet CD. Stand out tracks are ""Save Room"", ""Heaven"" and ""P.D.A (we just don't care)"" are fine pieces, but no ""Ordinary People"". There is much to enjoy, but you are advised to take it on its own merits and try not to compare."
4,Great CD,"CD quality was great, but the case was a little flimsy and not well made, this will be one of those cases that breaks after you've only had it for five minutes."
5,"wife likes it, it was delivered fast!","Ordered it for my wife, the price was fair, it arrived super fast, and it was in brand new condition. what more could you ask?"
2,What happened to the John Legend we all know and love?,"I am a big Legend fan, but I have to say I am really disappointed with this new cd. There we no soulful - ""bluesy"" over-tones that made his last cd ""Get Lifted"" over the top. Don't get me wrong, there are a few (maybe 3 at the most) songs worth listening to, but you just don't get pulled into his music like you did his Lifted cd. I just don't think he is Grammy bound on this one....."
5,Better than the Last,I bought this CD for my friend and she loves it. She said that she has looked forward to this CD for a long time and she is not disappointed. He keeps improving.
2,Thoroughly disappointed,"If you loved the first album and you're expecting more of the same as I was, you'll be thoroughly disappointed. He seemed to turn his back on the soulful,funky and edgy R & B that made Get Lifted great. This album seems like he's catering to the mass audience with predictable Barry Manilow like music. Too perfect production and boring at the same time. Ughh"
2,Hard to please movie critic,"I borrowed this book from the library; thought it would be interesting to compare it to Mick Martin and Marsha Porter's DVD and Video Guide. All I can say is, look up your favorite movies and see what Mr. Maltin has to say about them...he's one tough film critic. Some of his reviews even come off as nitpicky to me. I find the other book I mentioned is much more fair and the reviewers have similar opinions to mine. I do like the alphabetical film listing of both books and the paperback format, however. Glad I didn't actually buy this or receive it as a gift!"
1,Disappointing,This is the worst guide to DLRP. The author clearly hasn't done his homework and judging by the misinformation concerning the newer attractions must not have visited the place at all in the past ten years. His descriptions of the Indiana Jones ride (ie that it runs forwards and then backwards through a loop) and the Canal Boats (he says there is a guide cast member on board each boat)are just plain wrong. At the very least a purchaser should be able to expect such information to be factually correct. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss.
2,Quite lame actually,"Not bad to spin once or twice, but the whole problem with these remake/tribute/cover CD's is that many of the songs sound pretty much like the original recording, rendering the new version pretty much pointless. There's a couple of tunes on ""Punk Goes Metal"" that are a bit different and unique- ""Love Song"" by Ten Foot Pole is pretty cool and the Atari's version of ""I Remember You"" is fun. But most of the songs end up sounding just like the originals. The guitar and drum sound is definitely in that pop/punk vein but it doesn't do enough to set a song like ""Looks That Kill"" or ""Little Fighter"" apart from the original. And the only way you can tell the Ozzy covers apart are the American accents on the vocals. I can't really speak for the covers of Leather Pirate's ""Why Rock"" or St. Madness' ""Sexual Abuse"" since I've never heard of either of those two bands. But if you're not expecting much, it's a decent batch of '80s hard rock redone, but not all that exciting."
1,"Metal fans, avoid at all costs.","If you're a fan of metal, particularly from the 80s, beware. This CD is full of butchered versions of some of your favorite songs, by emo and pop/punk bands. I wonder if this is supposed to be a tribute to metal, or an insult.""I Remember You"", originally by Skid Row and covered here by the Ataris, is particularly bad. Once a sincere, emotional ballad with an awesome guitar solo, The Ataris managed to turn it into run-of-the-mill pop/punk garbage. I half expected the singer to scream ""let's go!"" at some point in the song. And speaking of the singer, he can't even handle the entire song, and is forced to sample Sebastian Bach's original lyrics later on.And as if that weren't bad enough, their are butchered versions of classic songs by Guns N' Roses, Judas Priest, Motley Crue, and ACDC."
3,Promising...,"Shapes of things to come...A young guitar wiz from Memphis,Tennessee,Eric Gales is in top form throughout,however the quality of songwriting is much inferior to his sophomore effort."
5,"dance, spaceman, dance!!","this is one whacked-out, transcendent piece of electronic noodle. it's an amazing japanese take on disco, surf rock, robot music and rock & roll, filtered through Tron and then taken to outer space. you know how in sci-fi movies they always show wormholes as these long, amazing suction tubes where everything zips by the characters super-fast, and you think ""wow! that looks pretty fun""? that's what listening to this album is like. zooming."
3,Not switchfoot quality,"This album has some great songs,Let Your love be strongAwakeningHead over Heelsbut the rest are pretty forgettable. Like Amateur Lovers, what in the world is the point of that song?Well, I know what its about, I just don't think its very well done.It seems switchfoot is trying to experiment as much as possible, and make ""new"" sounds, but I loved them for the old!!!!Like someone said above me, the album seems rushed, like they did a bunch of songs in a short time.If you liked ""The Beautiful letdown"" then this album is not for you(Hello Hurricane is more their old style)"
3,not so good,This cd is not so good as the last cd from switchfoot.The best song on the cd for me is awakening.
5,grew into one of the best,"I was introduced to Switchfoot with their excellent album 'The Beautiful Letdown'. Like a lot of people I have rated their subsequent albums on how well they mimic TBL.And so I initially was quite disappointed with this album. But after some months I think it is one of their best. It is harder music, but still very tight and thoughtful. I encourage people to listen to it not as a 'Switchfoot' album, but as an album. In that light, it is excellent and speaks very well of Switchfoot's ability to write excellent music that is not easy to pidgeonhole."
3,Follow the Road to Nowhere,"Not a long-term Rosetta fan, I picked this up on impulse at one of my favourite music shops, thought it was going to be brilliant when I heard the 'Road to Nowhere', and was horribly disappointed by most of the rest of it. Let me say this - the 'Road to Nowhere' version on this album is FANTASTIC. I never liked the original (one of the weakest songs the Heads ever did, if you ask me), but this incredible industrial version on this album is just amazing. Unfortunately, 'Are Friends Electric' sounds exactly like I remember the Numan original sounding, 'Synchronicity' is nowhere near as good as the Police did, and most of the rest are just decent. Why 3 stars then? 2 for 'Road to Nowhere' and 1 for the concept of making decent Euro synth pop sound fairly cool as goth/industrial music. Not very powerful industrial, though."
1,Awful,"If you are interested in masculine spirituality at all you will never, ever, ever buy the book ""His Story"" by Nicholas R. Mann.... it was absolutely the worst book I have ever read on anything dealing with masculinity.The first major problem with the book was the fact that the author was full of himself. There are a couple of passages in the prologue that points this out. Secondly it was unprofessional, and heavily opinionated, and wrongly so. It was almost reading a radical feminist's perspective on male mysteries and sexuality. Which would be kind of like a guy talking about what giving birth is like.None of his opinions are scientifically backed up, nor does he refer to any sources to show its validity either. And I loved the fact that he talked about great sources of information, but didn't really idolize them, or incorporate them into the book. All in all, it is a bad book. Do not buy it. Save it and buy HB Harris' book Emasculation of the Unicorn."
4,with the varnish off,"General St. John Richardson Liddell was a biased, cantankerous, violent man devoted to the Confederacy yet doubtful of its ultimate success. This is history with the varnish off; Liddell wrote this record immediately after the war and never expected it to be published in his lifetime. It's one of the essential texts for understanding the Confederate Army of Tennessee and provides great insight into the personalities of its commander. More importantly, it reveals in great detail the mind of one former Confederate."
5,A guide which gathers their diverse voices under one cover in order to present their views,"Drawn from the first generation of American Muslim women who have identified as being both American and Muslim comes a guide which gathers their diverse voices under one cover in order to present their views of how they live Islam within in a predominately Christian country. Reflections on God, religion, secularism and friendships both within and outside the faith provide unique first-person reflections on how Islam is lived in daily life. Living Islam Out Loud is simply a 'must' for anyone who would understand how these Muslim women practice their traditional faith within the social and cultural context of the every changing, secular, modern, non-Islamic world of America."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I have been pumping for my six-month-old son since he was born and purchased this book with the hopes that it would contain a wealth of knowledge and information that I was not aware of. I was wrong. This book does contain a good deal of information, but much of it is either common knowledge or readily available on the web (as mentioned in a previous review). The rest of it is a collection of stories from women who have pumped exclusively....I could get similar stories out of a magazine. I was hoping for some new, breakthrough information in this book, but it was not to be found. I would recommend this book to someone who has NEVER READ ANYTHING on expressing breastmilk. But for those of us who have been there and done that, there is nothing new here."
2,Disappointed,"John Varley is one of a handful of science fiction authors I still read (spent my 20s reading in this genre, then mostly lost interest) - I look to him for three-dimensional characters and imaginative plots. So when I saw ""Mammoth"" on the shelf of my local library, I was excited to discover a Varley novel I haven't yet read.I'm three chapters into ""Mammoth,"" and I actually stopped to see if it had been written as YA fiction - not that I have anything against YA, but surely adult fiction by a respected author would have graceful exposition, characters with depth, and compelling dialogue. Instead, this reads like third-rate Heinlein (and even first-rate Heinlein is first-rate because of its plots, not because of the quality of its writing).I might have enjoyed this back in my SF-reading days, but my standards for good writing have changed since then, and this isn't it. Back to the library it goes."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable Read,"As a long time science fiction fan, I have to say that this one hit all the right buttons for me. Well worth reading and enjoying.Sean O'ReillyEditor-at-LargeTravelers' Tales"
3,excellent writing weak story device,"After enjoying most of the book with Varley's masterful command of the english language, I was kind of stunned by his explanation of the creation of the temporal dislocation device. the time device was found next to a frozen wooly mammoth along with a frozen hominid wearing a wrist watch 12000 or 13000 yrs ago. Varley explains the device as being created by the speculations of the scientist hired to investigate the device, by examining and replicating the device. sort of a grandfather paradox loop,whereby examining a quantum device you might be creating it in the past. this plot device is patent gibberish.Also Varley's hero states that although held in isolation foralmost a year, he admires the federal government because theydidn't starve him or torture him, like 'other' governments do. Iguess John has been asleep for a couple of years. It's a shame because the author writes so well. oh well.........."
1,Utterly banal,"I've always found Ms. Anderson's work to be kind of maddening, if it wasn't so simultaneously narcotizing. She clearly has the chops, but I wish she'd inject a bit of variation into her playing, a bit more creativity. All the benign smiling and the bland and frankly ridiculous background graphics of jellyfish and starving lions won't cover for the fact that all of this stuff sounds the same..."
4,Interesting variety,"I ordered this book specifically for the chapter on noted Czech photographer, Josef Koudelka. The chapter is a wonderful concise review with several photos featured. Many of the other chapters provided interesting and well researched documentation of other noted photographers."
1,crap,"Firstly, the buttons seem to protrude too much, cauing them to be depressed unintentionally. After about a week a couple of the buttons seemed to jam up. A week later the display turned off completely. All this after only 2 weeks of wear. This watch is a poorly designed piece of crap."
4,great product!,"it took me forever to decide to buy these becuase i was low on cash, but one day i just decided to buy it, as a little splurge for myself, and im so glad i did! they gave an estimated arrival date but they came a week early, and it was a holiday weekend! i dont think it took more than a week for them to arrive! it was amazing! there so nice. its a velvity texture and looks so nice in any car! its got a thin back layer that covers the entire back of the seat, which i thought was so cool and fits so nicely over my 1995 toyta tercel seats. they wernt hard to put over the seat at all! it took less than 5 minutes for me to apply both of them....i just love em. my next buy is the matching stearing wheel cover"
4,PJ Toronto,"I was at this show and I think it was top quality thanks to the participation of the crowd. During 'Wishlist' the entire arena put their arms up during the line '50 million arms upraised...' which seemed to both surprise and thrill Eddie (I think you can hear him kind of chuckle right after the line). Additionally, the crowd participation turned Baba O'Riley from an appreciated cover into a real event. This CD really captures an imperfect, yet perfect show from one of the world's top live bands."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER !,"AMAZON, DO NOT SELL THIS PRODUCT TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER !Beware. This toaster is unsafe. I purchased this product on September 27, 2008 and on December 15, 2008, it almost caught my kitchen on fire. The 2 left slots will not eject the toast. Also, the special eject push button does not work. Had I not been in the kitchen, the bread would have caught fire. The bread ended up being so charred it was worthless. So much for assuming the toaster works properly. I have tried contacting T-Fal via the telephone and email. T-Fal sent me an email with ""incident # 081213-000013"" but to date, no one has contacted me back. The wait-time on the phone is ridiculous. T-Fal should have more respect for consumers. So now, I'm expected to ship the product to a T-Fal service center and pay for shipping on a product that didn't even last 3 months? Please Amazon, remove this product from your store and do not sell it to anyone else. Model # 572727 Ref # TT750150/4YA-4707"
1,BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP,"THIS UNRELIABLE TOASTER BURNS OR LEAVES BREAD PALE ON THE SAME SETTING. IT IS TOUTED AS FAST, BUT IS TERRIBLY SLOW. I RETURNED IT AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY INSPECTED IT AND DECIDED THAT THE BREAD I USE MUST BE ""TOO WET."" THEY SHIPPED IT BACK TO ME. AFTER I SAID I DIDN'T WANT IT I WANTED A REFUND, I WAS MAILED A COUPON FOR A FEW DOLLARS OFF MY ""NEXT PURCHASE."""
1,"Stylish, but that's all","I was excited to read all the glowing reviews of this toaster, but for me it was a serious disappointment.Half of the elements don't work in each slot, so your toast comes out done on one side and white on the other.It also tips forward any time you put the toast or lift levers down.I'd send it back but my wife threw out the box. Definitely not recommended."
3,Good Product....Bad quality control,"After receiving this toaster from Computer Brain I found that the right side lever would not stay down, making this four slice a two slice model unless you wanted to hold it down while it toasts. The electrical contact switch that engages that side was defective. Sent back, then looked elsewhere but this model is scarce at retail stores. So I reordered through Amazon again but from a different supplier. Should be here in a couple of days. Looked great next to all stainless appliances."
4,T-fal Avante toaster,"This model is ricketier than the one I bought just a year ago or so. (That one still works - we needed a second one for the travel-trailer). But I like the new feature of toasting 40% faster, and the bagel toasting offer. The 'lift' lever doesn't bring the bread up high enough."
1,"BELOW AVERAGE, BUT GOOD LOOKING","Bought the toaster because of its touted reviews of how evenly it toasts your bread.. HOWEVER, it does NOT,.. the top of the toast consistently is untoasted. Also, WHEN will someone make a temperature control that can actually take advantage of the full 7 digits? the temperature control knob is cheap plastic and will burn your bread at the 3 of 7 setting(like i said, don''t even know why they have 4-5-6-7 settings?)... OVERALL,,, if you are buying a toaster just for looks, it's great... if you are buying a toaster to toast, don't."
2,Single pieces of Toast fly out of Toaster,"I purchased this toaster because I loved my previous T-Fal toaster. I think it's great it's a little bigger than my previous toaster, but definitely more modern. It toasts quickly and very well, but I have one issue. If I only put in one slice of bread it flys and I mean flys out of the toaster onto the floor. I've positioned it sideways on the the counter and placed a plate in front of it to catch it. The kids think it's so funny. I think it's annoying...I'm looking into getting a replacement. :)"
5,Cute,"I love my toaster. I bought it about a year ago and forgot to review it, so I'm in love with how it works not just how it looks."
4,Toaster,"It is a little big but then again it is a 4 slice toaster. Toasts just fine, nothing extraordinary about the toaster in any way, good or bad."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this toaster based on the good reviews. I was tired of the cheap toasters that wouldn't toast on BOTH sides of the bread and thought this more expensive toaster would be different. It's not. It only toasts thoroughly on one side. What a bummer. I was willing to overlook the fact that it's a huge toaster IF it would toast on both sides. I do like the fact that the front is curved so that you can see into it and that it has a lever to lift the bread out; however, I would gladly give up those bonuses to simply have a toaster that toasts both sides of the bread simultaneously."
5,Hate Doing Reviews but Find Them Helpful when Im in Need,This is one great toaster. You will not be disappointed once you find the right setting for your family. We had a Kitchen Aide that was junk and I tossed it in the trash. The handle had even popped off so wasn't even worth donating....this is a good buy.
1,cold toast,"This particular toaster was defective. We had used this brand, but not model,before and loved it.It would actually toast the toast or bagel, but it was cold in milli seconds.The company again took it back and is replacing it with another. Apparently the thermostat and something else was wrong and not fixable."
1,Defective!!!,"I like that the slots are angled; which works great under my counter. That's the only good thing about it. It didn't matter what setting it was on, it wouldn't toast right. One time I had it on 2 and it barely toasted, the next it burned the toast. Now the toast won't even stay down anymore. I refuse to stand there holding it down; so tothe trash it goes!!"
1,"Well, it looks nice ...","... but I returned it. Every manufacturer of toasters specify how 'wide' the slots are for toasting bagels, muffins, etc. But, they rarely specify how 'long' the slots are. The first thing I tried was a slice of ""Levy's Real Jewish Rye"". It wouldn't fit lengthwise. Failing that basic test, I packed it up and sent it back without trying to toast anything. If I can't fit bread into it, it's simply not worth having."
1,Made in USA,"The description of this toaster indicates that it is made in the USA. We received the T-fal Avante Deluxe Toaster today and written on the box states Made in China, distributed in the USA. We are returning it."
3,the jury's still out,"I was excited about this toaster since my MIL has a T-FAL toaster that I really like. This is a different model but I was still expecting great quality...I'm not so sure that's what I got. The toasting is very uneven, I can see several heating elements that are not lighting up. Also, the buttons and levers just don't seem to be the best quality. Several people mentioned the large size but I don't think it is much larger than a standard 4-slice toaster, if at all. My previous cheapie toaster lasted over 7 years so if this one lasts that long, I guess I'll feel better about my purchase. I do like the middle levers that lift your bread up which means no burned fingers."
2,pretty nice except for actually making toast !,"The design and construction of this toaster was very nice, as long as you don't actually use it to toast anything. Maybe ours was defective... like many previous reviewers, we found it would toast one corner of the bread very lightly while another corner was burned. The adjustment dials did not seem consistent.. one day #four worked well, another day it had to be turned down to #two. Summary: it looked great and felt well made, had some nice design touches... but didn't toast bread well at all. We returned it."
1,Great if you like burnt toast and uneven toasting.,"My first mistake was to buy this toaster, the second was to throw out the box and receipt. We had a white Cusinart for years and had no problem, but then we redid our kitchen and got SS appliances so we bought this toaster.It has never toasted anything even, one side will be perfect the other burnt no matter what setting it is on and if you slice your bread thin forget it charcoal city is what you get. It is good looking and has some nice features and is not too big for our kitchen but when it comes to making toast it is a looser.Others say it is great, maybe I just got one that sucks, going to donate it to a charity and get something else."
4,Very good toaster,"We've had this toaster for about a month. We use it 3-4x/week. I believe it does a great job toasting bread, bagels, waffles, etc... It is a big toaster. It's the biggest I've ever seen. The only feature I'd change is to allow both sides to have a bagel setting. This model only allows bagel toasting in the 2 left slots. Other than that one issue, I think its a great toaster. Looks very nice as well."
3,Looks good Works so-so,"Fell in love with the looks of this toaster, but the settings on it aren't do great. No matter where you set them, the toast doesn't get brown before it pops up. So, I am still stuck toasting twice!"
1,Uneven heating - defective,"I received the toaster very swiftly. I am okay with the way it looks also. However, it would burn half and not toast the other half of a piece of bread even at the lower settings which makes it un-usable. The return policy was very short and I missed the deadline. So now i have to send it to the manufacturer. But at this point, i would like to just get a refund. I don't want the hassle of getting it repaired. I would like my money back."
2,Feels very much like part one of a trilogy,"...and I sure hope the rest of it is better than this. Parts are intriguing, but all the human characters are cardboard, the plot almost seems too limited by its own place in the grander scheme, and a complete lack of continuity (no references to Kressilac or the Coral Kingdom) bring it down quite a bit. I'm sure it will be much better once all three books are read, but for the moment, it doesn't stand alone at all."
2,Ok While They Last,"My second pair of TV Ears just broke. These were my second pair only because I had purchased my first pair with warranty. I will not buy a third pair. Both pairs broke in the same place. The upright that holds the earbud broke right where it joins the base. This is the area that gets all the stress when putting on and taking off the product. I recommend to the manufacturer that this area be built up with extra and stronger plastic or simply make the entire product stronger. In time, with normal use they will break. Also what I found annoying were the ear tips that needed to be constantly replaced. What's ironic is I paid $99 for a product that I can tell you is vastly inferior to the earphone type I will replace it with for 30 bucks less."
5,Wife Happy,Got TV Ears for my wife who is having difficulty catching all the dialog on programs. She loves them. Now she is enjoying watching movies with me again. She also loves the fact they don't mess up her hair!I sometimes watch and lisen to TV privately with a nice set of headphones. The sound quality of those is terrific. That's why I gave 4 rather than 5 stars to the sound quality of TV ears. It's relative. The sound is fine - just not superb.
1,Needs to build a better mouse trap,"product and service was a hugh disappointment. After following directions (video & paper) and calling serv rep I was left with headset that all I got was static. Rep promised to send microphone to correct problem but never received it. I sent back and am still waiting for credit on charge card. My advice is to stick to establish company, Sony, Samsung etc."
1,TV Ears A Disappointment,"TV Ears hold great promise, but fails to deliver. They are poorly made. I bought two sets and they have both failed in different ways. Manufacturer denies that there are problems. If they cost about half what they do, I might replace them."
2,You've been warned,"I don't often ignore the reviews on Amazon but I did this time. I won't ever do it again. This headset works great until it breaks. It lasted 5 months, just out of warranty, and the transmitter broke- by itself like magic. The company was sad that it was no longer covered, but offered to replace it for only $30, and then reminded me that I'd need a new battery soon (they're advertised to last 1-2 years) and offered to save me some shipping costs if I'd order it now for another $25. Obviously, these folks make their money on replacement parts and shipping and handling fees.Look at the Sennheiser. We bought it as a replacement and threw the TV Ears away, and it's cheaper, it's more comfortable to wear, has better sound, and the reviews from others gives me reason to believe that it's much better manufactured."
3,"A Want, not a Need.","When I saw this product I thought it was going to save a lot of headaches. It's a practical fix for the occasional problem. I found that if I have it sitting there I won't make the effort to use it. I often look at it and think if I had that cash in my pocket right now would I have bought this thing a second time, probably not. It works very well and is comfortable and all the things it says it is. The reality is when I want use it I probably should be sleeping or reading instead and the light from the TV is equally annoying to the person in the bed next to me. One problem is line of sight. It would be nice if could walk out of the room. I would like to be able to walk to the kitchen or bathroom and still hear but as soon as you get out of the beams reach the static hiss maked you turn it off.TG"
4,Very helpful,This product has been very helpful for my elderly mother as she can not clearly hear the tv while sitting her favorite easy chair.
4,TV Ears,"The TV Ears are a good item for helping to hear any TV program without distributing other people.thanks,Mike"
2,A lot of background noise,I have found that there's a lot of background noise - changing the settings (volume and tone) doesn't seem to eliminate the background noise.
3,TV Ears are great but short lived,"This is the third set of TV Ears I have purchased, not because I want them in every room but because the transmiter only lasts about a year. It is cheaper to just purchase another system. My other two sets were purchased at Costco."
1,did not work,My mother is in a nursing home and was looking forward to being able to hear the TV. She and I where both disapointed it did not work on her TV or 2 others I tried. It will be returned and I found out they don't refund the shipping and handing charges plus they charge a 15% restocking fee plus I pay return shipping. The bottom line its going to cost me over $25 to reutrn a product that does not work.
2,Setup glitch & $$$ replacement batteries a big minus,"When I first set it up all I could get was static; fortunately unplugging both cords from the base stand for ~15 seconds reset the thing and restored function. It works well enough now, allowing me to hear dialog much more clearly than with the unaided ear.I've only had it for a day now, and the biggest issue I have is the cost of replacement batteries. They're said to last 1-2 years and replacements are only sold attached to a complete replacement front plate for the astronomical total of $20/. This is something they don't go out of their way to make clear, but it's an unpleasant surprise in store for the unsuspecting consumer. I'm seriously considering taking mine back to Costco where the 2.3 is sold for $39.95 and looking for something that uses more reasonably priced consumables."
1,TV Ears,The concept of TV ears is good for People who have hearing problems and watching TV But That is where it stops After 15 to 30 mins The ear buds become uncomfortable After 2 hours of use the left ear bud fell off and did not snap back on as easy as instructed Sound Quality Med to Poor if someone walks in front of you and your viewing area Static and sound drop out occur also if you turn your head or drop your chin Also the high price you have to pay for this product is way to much I paid over $100 Certainly not worth the cost I own another Wireless headset That I have had for a few years made by Clearline concepts cost 29.95 Catalog Order not top of the line Works like Stereo headphones but not the problems I am having with TV Ears Hopefuly I will be able to send TV ears Back for a full refund Thanks for Reading
5,"ORIGINAL, FUN, COOL, ONE-OF-A-KIND!",Dave Alvin's unique voice...a more than wonderful rock/soulful guitarist...an awesome band...100% originality. This is one of the best rock albums of all times!!! There is nothing like it!!! WANT MORE!
4,The more you listen...the better it gets.,"Like the Velvet Underground, The Pixies were a band that never achieved huge chart success or got a lot of radio play. But both bands were very influential to a large number of bands that followed in the wake. No Velvet Underground would have meant no David Bowie, Patti Smith or Iggy Pop. No Pixies would have meant no Nirvana, Sonic Youth or Pavement.This was their last release before their break-up in 1991. It's really a Black Francis album. Every song was written by him except for the Jesus & Mary Chain cover ""Head On"". It a strong release that gets better upon repeated listens. There are 15 songs here and only 2 are over three minutes so if you don't like what you're hearing, just wait a minute. My favorite tracks are ""U-Mass"" which must have gone nuts when The Pixies this there, ""Palace of the Brine"" which sounds like a hard-rocking T-Rex, and ""Subbacultcha"" which totally apart rips hipster trends, with a punk attitude over a Peter Gunn like riff."
3,The Swan Song?,"I recall that when the album came out it was already known that this was going to be the Pixies last album together and one major clue was that Kim Deal's voice was almost nowhere to heard. At it's best songs like, ""Subacultcha"" and the jesus and Mary Chaine cover, ""Head on"" rock but seem a bit unenthused and pale next to the Pixies previous albums, Basanova, Dolittle etc. This album also cemented all beliefs that Black Francis loves aliens and UFOs. The noise is a bit too melodiuous on the final album, a bit too dreamy."
3,The end of the line and time to quit,"Come on Pilgrim, Surfer Rosa and Doolittle maybe were a little to good. Bossanova wasn't the half of any of those and finally on Trompe Le Monde they reach the end. Trompe is a much more aggresive record then any of the others and is more varied in style. ""U-Mass"" and the title track are both classic Pixies. ""Alec Eiffel"" and ""Motorway to Rosewell"" attempt but fail on the style Frank Blck would claim as his own on a solo carrer. The last piece in the most wonderful power pop puzzel ever."
5,cracker/crumbsnatcher digs this album,"let me say one thing first - i'm white and i really don't listen to much rap at all...but i have had this cd since '91 and it is the staple of my collection. it's mellow/funky rhymes and beats absolutely rock. it is one of the best albums i own and it is probably the only cd that i listen to constantly...buy it, you might like it..."
4,Good introduction to Ashtanga Sun Salutations,"This DVD is a good introduction to the most basic fundamentals of ashtanga yoga practice. As the other reviewers said, it contains only Sun Salutations, guiding you through the poses. There is a fabulous feature that allows you to access more detailed information about how to do a pose correctly if you need it, or you can play the video without that feature. If you know how to do Sun Salutations you may want to choose a more advanced DVD. One other reviewer mentioned that she was annoyed by Nicki Doane's voice. I don't love her voice either- she tends to speak in a gentle monotone- but her voice doesn't annoy me. Overall it is a great intro DVD."
1,not what I expected,"This DVD arrived a bit late, but that wasn't the real problem. It was in black and white and was very hard to navigate - I don't believe the entire instructional class was there. I don't know - I got tired of trying to figure out how to navigate the thing. I used to have the video of this and it was great - the DVD I got was not comparable. I won't be using it."
2,Mostly boring,"This album is so boring in most places. I don't know where Keith Sweat's head was at. It doesn't keep your attention on the second half. Keep it Comin' was okay, but the other songs Keith produced as well as Joe Public were lousy. He was smart to include There You Go from New Jack City, but the songs before and after it are so bland, It seemed like the formula that worked for Keith Sweat's first two albums didn't work here. I fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here? Sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs. If he had wanted to, he would have given these songs to Usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(Usher). But I warn you, don't get this album--it's going to let you down!"
3,Generic,"Don't expect these to stick to the timing belt cover on their own. You'll need some gasket sealant to make them stick and even that is tricky. Seems to be just some generic gasket. Not particularly fitted for my application, Lexus ES300 V6 1mz-fe engine. There is one long gasket that's needed for the upper timing belt cover. The rest of the gaskets are shorter. Not an OEM fit."
2,What was the expiration date?,"I LOVE the cereal, however, when I've purchased it at a store it was fantastic and what I bought through Amazon was a bit stale. The cranberries were so hard I couldn't bite into them."
3,"Good features, but one annoyance and poor life span","I'll echo all the positive things others have said - it controls all my devices (with some learning), battery life is fine, key layout is good.But two big negatives: (1) as others have noted, it is annoying that you have to hit a key to wake it up before doing anything, including using the hard keys.(2) the graphics on the illuminated keys are wearing out (going dark). The ""skip"" key (the most frequently hit) started wearing out right away, but isn't noticeable because in Cable setting, the worn out center part is off. Now (about a year), play, pause, and power are wearing out.one other gripe, but minor: it's a little short on buttons. Mainly, it lacks Day+/- or DVR tuner swap. There were unused keys to remap to those, but I can never remember which I used.I'll use it till it breaks, but I won't buy another Kameleon style. I'll stick with OFA, but with an all-hard-key model."
4,MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT !,"Recent Disney productions are not consistently all that good and I wondered about this one before buying it. Well actually it is quite good and my daughter who already knows a lot of the older Disney movies loves it! The animation (2D classic type) is convincing. The colors are good and even though we have here a very free adaptation of the original story, it is fun to watch. I like the many musical references to classical music in the soundtrack. That makes it a rich movie for kids to watch as well as being very entertaining."
5,One of our kids favorites.,Great Disney animated movie. One of our kids' favorites and one that its most usually played on our minivan on road trips.
4,My kids love the movie,"My kids really enjoy this movie. I wish I would have been able to buy the digital copy rather than just renting it, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 rating. I should probably just break down and buy the DVD! But it's a cute movie and has all of their favorite characters in it."
5,Fun for the Whole Family,"I really feel this movie is one of the better new Mickey films. We especially like the characterization of Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Daisy. Oh, and the kids love the Goofy-Clarabelle love story."
5,BEST COLLECTION EVER,SINCE I COLLECT MICKEY MOUSE PLUSH IT WAS GREAT FOR MY COLLECTION I'VE BEEN SEARCH FOR THIS MICKEY MOUSE ITS PERFECT IT WAS FAST SERVICE
1,Simply Awful,"Very sad to see the classic characters treated like vapid Hollywood brats. Yes, there is an attempt at a message of 'teamwork', but it's pounded in with a sledgehammer against it's will as the characters constantly try to one-up and insult each other before deciding, nonsensically, ""Oh yes, let's work together.""Like so much of the modern Hollywood children's fare, this movie is constantly choking on it's own wit as it makes fun (rudely) of the 'children's classic' genre even as it tries to become one.Suffice to say, if you're a 45-y-o adult child with a room full of Star Wars and Disney collectibles, you'll love this movie."
2,Save your money,"I wanted to like this, but it just doesn't hold up to the classic Disney shorts. You are better off getting The Prince and the Pauper or Mickey and the Beanstalk if you want to see a well made team up of the classic Disney characters."
3,"Entertaining, yet not totally explained","I agree with most of the reviewers. The book is well written and kept my interest, however, there are some plot twists that do not make sense. I recommend the book but not a best seller."
3,Give me a Break,"Yeah right, let me win 100 million tax free. No problem I can live in another country.I actually liked Jackson,(Jack's son)he was cool. I didn't like the stupidity of some of the other characters, like his sister."
3,"Complex as always, although not memorable","While not the best baldacci novel I have read, The winner is still worth reading for those of you who have really enjoyed his books previously. The premise is that a young, uneducated woman in poverty is given the chance to win 100 million dollars if she will keep her mouth shut about how her winning this money comes about. She accepts and the story slowly lifts off from there. Like most good books, the story unravels slowly at first, the stakes raising towards a decent ending. I do not mean that to be negative to the plot, it is very interesting, but I had trouble even caring about the characters. It is a good read,though, and I reccommend it to fans of Baldacci but for those new to this author, try Total Control or The Simple Truth first."
3,Suspenseful but so inconsistent.,"Interesting plot (dirt-poor single mom wins fixed lottery), but poorly written. Inconsistencies abound. Why would a man who kills indiscriminately NOT kill the heroine when he has the chance (several times!)? We're told over and over again of Jackson's omnipotence. Maybe he's human after all... LuAnn's superwoman instincts happen to fail her at the most convenient times! I found some of the action scenes quite hilarious (not the original intention I'm sure.) That said, I still admit I read it quickly, and there are a few surprises."
2,The worse of the Three!!!,"The Winner seems to be Baldacci's worse book yet. While it is seems to be intruiging as a mystery, it fairs poorly on other parts. He seems to combine action, mystery, and suspense into one book---it just doesn't work here."
5,Fun Fun Fun!,"If you haven't read this one, grab it! It was a light, fun read - kept a fast pace, and totally grabbed my interest. Wish I could win the lottery! hehe"
5,Entertaining Story!,LuAnn Tyler is a beautiful twenty year old who is also quitepoor.She eeks out a living working as a waitress.She also has an abusive boyfriend that further makes her life miserable.Shealso has a baby that is the love of her life.A mysterious figure offers LuAnn a chance of a lifetime.Shewill be the winner of a $100 million dollar lottery prize.Inorder to win this jackpot she has to change her identity andleave the United States forever.This is an offer that she daresto refuse until events force her hand.She then decided to takethe offer.She finally does the unthinkable act and breaks the promise that made her wealthy.Her decision to break her promise comes with consequences.Shenow has to battle the financial mastermind who has created herwealth.She discovers that the mastermind can take away her newlife at will.This is the challenge of a lifetime for LuAnn.Thisis a very good book that you will enjoy reading.
1,Baldacci Disappoints!,"It seems each of Baldacci's books is half as good as his previous effort. With a predictable storyline and shallow unbelievable characters, The Winner would have you believe that someone could fix a national lottery only to have someone else claim the prize. The entire F.B.I. is unable to solve any aspect of the case but a newspaper reporter acting alone solves it 10 years after the fact in a month or two. The only reason ther is a book at all is because the main character (LuAnne)decides that even with 100 million dollars, she must return to the United States from overseas to live in the town where mother was born. While I understand you must suspend belief for this type of fiction, Baldacci asked too much of me this time around."
3,"Good story, weak characters.","The Winner has a good plot. It is fast-paced and the twists and turns are unexpected. Unfortunately the main character is poorly written. She was too one-dimensional and I was never able to cheer her on or really care what happened to her. She was just too perfect. If you are looking to read a Baldacci book, read Total Control instead - it has a great plot and great characers."
4,I Liked it!,"This is the second David Baldacci book I have read, the first being ""The Simple Truth"". I enjoyed it, so looked to see which one was next. I thought this one was a bit long, but all in all, it kept me interested. Not too gory, not too prissy. I thought it was a good idea to write about, quite original. I liked the character development. The ten year gap was covered plausibly. And I liked Charlie - he was a sweetie.I do not like foul language, gratuitous sex or violence - and that's hard to find these days.Somewhat farfetched, but hey, it's fiction, right? A nice change for me! Easy to read. I will look for another D.Baldacci book to read."
2,The Winner,"The violence (and there was a lot of it) got really old, because it seemed to be the same thing over and over. I found the plot to be shallow."
5,Definitely a Winner,"This is a great, must-read book. A little confusing at the beginning but it all comes together for many suprises. I could not put this book down! If you liked Baldacci's others, you'll love this one!"
4,David Baldacci is absolute winner after wrting this book!,This is the first one I have read of him. And now I will read his all past and future creations. The characterisation of the main character i.e. Tyler is very nicely descrbibe and one can think as herself in all the situations of the story. The plot of the story is very rare and bold. So one just thinks how the lottery can be fixed. This is totally a new surprising story by a very well surprised author. I am waiting to read his latest the simple truth. I hope his all new coming stories will be more surprising and having fine new plot which no one can imagine.
4,Worth the read,"Although a slow start, The Winner turns out to be a highly exciting adventure story as LuAnn and those close to her fight for their lives against the devilish Jackson. The excitement and suspense of the end of the novel really puts this book above other action stories. Not knowing what is going to happen to LuAnn keeps the reader on her toes. I especially like the character of LuAnn, a poverty stricken young woman who defies all odds through sheer will, determination and natural strenght to protect the life of her daughter and survive the mess she was forced into ten years ago. This novel lacks the dominance of Absolute Power, but a great read nonetheless."
4,$100 million - yes please,"Baldacci really does know how to produce a good read - and ""The Winner"" is no exception.Not part of a series (as many of his books are) this one focuses on the winner of a fixed national lottery, the beautiful LuAnn Tyler, young Mum and Southern trailer dweller. With a great baddie in Jackson and excellent peripheral characters such as Charlie, Baldacci once again produces the goods. Enjoy the ride."
3,"Boring; Below expectations; Been there, done that.",This is my first Baldacci. Same old recycled cat chases mouse theme. Adds nothing to the old formula. The ending is obvious and predictable from page 100.
4,another best seller for baldacci,This has a different twist to the normal baldacci washington thrillers. It is something that could happen in the future and has been attempted by others in the past..
4,Loved it,"I wanted a quick, easy read for a car trip, it was perfect. I thought the story was clever. I would recommend it"
2,"""Predictable"" suspense thriller","Aside from the the villian dressing up (and cross dressing), this was a tried and tested and tired story line - beautiful and feisty heroine, hunky hero with a shady past (that just happens conveniently to be in the FBI) and crafty crimminal who is too clever for his own good (much like the master crimminals in the James Bond series). The overall idea of rigging a lottery is a good one for a thriller but the story line and the relationships and histories of the characters were so contrived and convenient that it made for predictable reading."
5,Fun Magazine,Was a gift. Person wanted it and really likes reading it. Also enjoys the pictures. Great for someone who likes surfing
3,Ok,"This movie is ok if you have a free afternoon, wasn't as funny as I expected but I liked it shows how kids can really change your life even in a bad way if you let it. The cast is great."
1,friends with kids,Did not get to watch it since amazon could not stream for some reason. Will watch another time on Netflix. Movie may be good.
2,not very good,"It's just not very funny, pretty boring and predictable, and sometimes even cringe-worthy. Jennifer's definitely weird. It really does all seem to be about her hair. I'm sure she's more interesting in real life. How does she get these things made?"
5,This is a good movie!,"The problem with unconventional romantic comedies is that they do not make as much money as conventional/repetitive romantic comedies. Wait, why is this a problem? Oh wait, it isn't, it is only a problem for studios who have programmed the public to expect repetition from their romantic comedies. Do not be persuaded. This is an original and highly lovable movie filled with the people we love. They should just stick together and make tons of movies with different scripts. They are all super talented and could do any script justice - luckily, this script is golden. Thanks!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"It appeared to have a pretty good storyline, but the acting was atrocious. The story went all over the place and overall it was just plain bad. 90 minutes of torture."
3,"Seen Worse, Seen Better",Somewhat entertaining from a middle age perspective. We paid 1.00 for the rental. Would not have wanted to pay more.
4,Cute movie,Nothing to track like in a murder mystery or intense drama shows ... just really simple and easy to watch.
3,Very predictable,"This is one of those movies where you look at the person beside when the movie is over and say ""eh that was good I guess"". Its somewhat funny and slightly entertaining, but a little annoying on some level."
3,Entertaining,"Entertaining movie. Funny at times. Realistic. My boyfriend would have hated it, so I watched by myself on a plane."
3,The cycle of different couples with chidren,"The cycle of couple relationships exposed, and the different effects children have on different couples. Does he love love her? Does he really know her or not?"
1,interesting premise ... terrible conclusion,"The cast was awesome, the premise interesting, the potential great, but in the end **SPOILER** the main character reducing his character's development to wanting to have sex with a girl he hasn't been attracted to for the duration of the movie is idiotic and deplorable at best. The entire movie is about his transformation to seeing his best friend as his true love, and the only words he finds to sum up his realization is ""i want to !@#$ your brains out."" It's a great movie until the last 45 seconds ... and that was enough to ruin it for me."
2,"Should have a caution ""For viewers without maturity only""","I could only endure a few minutes of this hobbled together farce. Of course our kids are 50, 48 and 44. Our grandchildren (8) range in age from 11 to 22, with the 3 oldest in their early 20's.Maybe its just that seniors can not relate to and enjoy this. Thank God none our children or grandchildren are as inane as the cast in the movie."
1,Not What I Hoped,"Thought it would be funnier, but it was really disappointing. Also, it's a movie that's basically been made many times already. What's the one with Jennifer Aniston & Paul Rudd? It's the same, only not as good."
5,Fun movie,"This movie was a lot of fun to watch. The characters were funny and believable. The ensemble cast was fantastic. I highly recommend this movie if you like movies about friendships, relationships, and the growing pains we all go through as our lives change."
3,It was ok,It was a cute movie and had funny parts in it but I probably wouldn't watch it more than once. I didn't cry laughing but a good movie.
4,Friends with Kids,"Occasionally hilarious, this speedy comedy is a fun, simplified version of parenting and relationships. Lead actors Adam Scott and the wonderful Jennifer Westfeldt are exceptional as friends and believable as soul-mates. The ensemble cast is enviable, but the individual coupling-chemistry is not quite achieved."
2,Didn't like it,"Great cast, but most of the characters were underutilized (Kristin Wiig, for one, was almost nonexistent). Main story labored and was very predictable. Disappointing."
3,Interesting Point of View,The movie was an interesting twist on life that made you think about things in a different way. The ending was somewhat trite but it worked.
4,Really solid movie,"This was definitely worth the money. Well acted, subtle, full of twists and turns. Very well done. ALl of the couples were treated even handedly. I would watch again"
3,Meh,Realized not too far into the movie why it was so cheap to rent. I was really disappointed by the characters-- I really thought this movie would have been a lot more entertaining especially considering how many good actors /actresses were paired in it but the whole thing fell a bit flat and landed short of where I was hoping it would. I found myself wishing it would end a lot sooner than it did and was actually excited to delete it off of my que. It was just meh.
2,to stiff,"item to stiff, no comfort, slides on shoulder. look for better.find one with padding,and rubber grip that wont slide on shoulder."
5,Just a good album,"I was introduced to this album when I was about 12 or so....I've been looking for it for such a while now...It's my favorite by N.C. The track that brings back such fond memories is ""When I Fall In Love""....OMG....The version on the Stardust album is NO MATCH for this song....."
3,Lack of research is the key to this book.,"From Mr. Chopra's book, ""He didn't know what the term meant, only that yesterday had been Ash Wednesday and tomorrow therefore Good Friday."" This quote was taken directly from Mr.Chopra's book ""Lords of Light"" a novel, page 219. Mr. Chopra, for your information, Ash Wednesday is not part of Holy Week. It begins the day after Fat Tuesday, 40 days before Holy Week even begins. Holy Week begins on Palm Sunday (March 28th of this year) continues on to Holy Thursday (April 1st), Good Friday (April 2nd), and Holy Saturday (April 3rd). This year, Ash Wednesday was observed on Wednesday, February 17th, as far away from Good Friday as 40 days can manage. I was disappointed at the lack of research which caused this error and the inability of the editing staff who proof a book in not picking up such a glaring mistake.. I do wish to compliment you on the accuracy of the Jewish traditions."
2,This Book is TRYING to Say Something,This book is trying to illustrate a philosophy but may lose a lot of people in the translation. I found the book scarey in that we don't often know who is good and who is evil or if good and evil even exist. I wish the point was more clear.
2,"Good product, not recommended if you want to retract your tv","I purchased this bracket to install a small tv underneath a kitchen cabinet, and it was essential to me to retract the tv under the cabinet. For this purpose--retracting the tv so that it doesn't interfere with the counter--this bracket is useless...unless your kitchen cabinets extend AT LEAST 15"" at a minumum from the wall, regsrdless of the dimenstions of your tv. If you merely want a bracket that will attach to the underside of your kitchen cabinet and aren't interested in retracting the tv under the cabinet, this bracket will do fine. But if you want to retract it under the cabinet it won't work with standard 12"" or even 14"" cabinets. The extending rod is simply too long. If you want the bracket to retract, find an alternative. Most kitchen cabinets, by the way, extend either 10"" or 12"" or 14"" from the wall, and in these cases this bracket will not work for retracting."
3,VERY SMALL,"I like statement kind of jewelry so if you are like me, this is not for you. Petite is what I would call this. Its nice but too small for this girl. The vendor is great with timely shipping so there is nothing wrong with the vendor so do not misconstrue that with what I am saying."
1,Disappointed!,"I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and after reading one of the reviewsthat mention Dr. Watson was treated intelligently and not like abuffoon in the English television episodes, I was anxious to orderthis collection. The sound quality is horrible. There is anunderlying hum that is maddening. But at $5.99 it would costmore to send it back than keep. Save your money."
1,Make Sure You Have the Right Version of iTrip,"This is iTrip is for the older units. I just ordered the latest 20 gig iPod and this iTrip and the iTrip wouldn't fit. I had to return it and order the 3G iTrip. And yes, this version of iTrip doesn't install on Windows XP. You have to open the CD and import the ""iTrip songs"" into iTunes, and then change the name of the album to ""iTrip Stations"" and you're ready to go."
2,"Good idea, but almost useless",The iTrip is a clever device that allows you to broadcast your iPod on almost any FM frequency so that you can enjoy it in your car or with friends at work. It's a good idea but my iTrip only has a broadcast range of about two feet which is not acceptable to me. I noticed on the Griffin Technology website that range is not on the FAQ. Now I know why.I've tried the device on all the clear frequencies here is SoCal (there aren't many) with my truck (standing outside the cab in case the windshield was interfering) and with my house stereo which has an active antenna. Neither could pick up the iTrip when it was more than two feet away.When the iTrip was within 12 inches the sound quality was suprisingly clear but what good is that?I'm going to return mine.
5,Presant for my father.,My father loves this band and asked for this.He is very happy with his gift.It was shipped quickly at low cost.
5,sheeba,"I read this book in 1 sitting, I could not put it down. I livein southern Georgia about 40 miles Albany, Georgia and I do remember the storm. This book had so many in's and out's. For anyone that want's a really good fast paced book to read this should be at the top of you list. PLEASE READ."
3,An exasperating conclusion to an ambitious trilogy,"Closer to two-and-a-half-stars. ""The Anatomy Lesson"" illustrates much of what I don't care for in Roth's writing (and I *do* like much of what he writes). Nathan Zuckerman--who, in the first two novels of the trilogy, comes across as a nicely-layered character, possessing both a literary-romantic's heart and a vein of silent suffering for the pain his writing inadvertantly caused his family--is rendered starkly one-dimension in ""The Anatomy Lesson""; he is, in fact, little more than Roth's stock character: sexually depraved, self-centered, fond of farce and farcical philosophizing, and obnoxiously loquacious. The ceaseless talktalktalk in this novel is irritating more than enlightening, and the various subplots and supporting characters are unconvincing and, frankly, often uninteresting. By the end of the novel, I could not wait for Zuckerman to zip his yapper; an unfortunate way to conclude what is otherwise a masterful trilogy."
2,My first book by Roth,"I must say, I never got engrossed in the book. I never stop reading books, no matter how uninteresting, but I just couldn't get into it and struggled constantly to figure out what was happening. Seemed to be quite a bit of ranting and raving and non-stop monologues or one-sided conversations about random stuff. Just wasn't impressed, maybe the reader would be better off starting with the first of the Zuckerman series' and working their way down?"
2,Not as good as the others,This is the third novel in a trilogy Roth wrote (The Ghost Writer and Zukerman Unbound were the first two) and is a bit of a let down. Zukerman is ill and most of the novel flat on his back. Apart from the sections where his lady friends cheer him up by sitting on him (well it is a Roth novel!) most of the book is too introspective and repetitive. If you have read the first two then you might want to read this one but frankly there are many other better Roth novels.
3,Decent for a summer read,"I did enjoy this book. It started out quickly with action. The heroine is a strong woman and the man with a past is written fairly well. The book doesn't require you to think. You might learn a little about firefighting and all in all is a decent, quick summer read. It shouldn't take you too long and the story is interesting enough to keep you intrigued to the end."
3,Baggier than expected,"My previous pair of Sevens were also bootcut, but were much more slim fitting. These were quite baggy all around, though fit nicely on the hips. Will go for the Standard cut next time."
5,Written with painstaking historical research,"Set in ancient Minoa, Voice Of The Goddess is an epic novel of two lovers who must struggle to protect their island home from invasion from Mainland Greece, and survive the catastrophic 1628 BC explosion of the nearby island of Santorini. Judith Hand has combined painstaking historical research with a flair for dramatic story telling that truly emerses the reader into a time of Bronze Age high culture and a sophisticated society of Mediterranean goddess-worship of Crete as it existed 1600 years before the birth of Christ. Voice Of The Goddess is Hand's debut as a novelist and we can only look urgently for her next venture into historic fiction."
2,Out of Date,"I couldn't get through this novel. I tried and tried, but it just didn't measure up. It's big failing is that it makes far too many assumptions about Minoan Crete based on Gimbutas' work. Most scholars don't follow her template for Minoan Crete...the hippie/peaceful artisan thing just doesn't hold up any longer. I also found the characters rather uninteresting, although the main female character war intriguing. Anyway, since I just lost interest in the book and couldn't finish, I'll just say that it just doesn't jive with what we know about Minoan and Akkhain society."
5,THE ROSE IS MORE THAN JUST A ROSE,"I'd never thought of refurbishing a sailboat. To my surprise this witty, informative tale of happy travail kindled envy, and made the task seem excitingly do-able. Through the non-technical (mostly) content, I felt I'd come to know the author in unexpected ways. This project, he observes, taught him nearly as much about himself as he learned about restoration of this Atkins Packet Sloop. This is an exemplar of popular non-fiction and an excellent How To book. It is beautifully produced with artfully effective color and black and white photos and drawings. It is much more than a Coffee Table book. At the least it is intriguing and engrossing. Bob Duff"
1,A huge disappointment,"This book is utterly nonsensical. It seems the poet sat down with a thesaurus and looked for the oddest words she could find. When she wasn't doing that, she made up words, which sound ridiculous. There's no rhyme or reason or beauty here. Very silly stuff, and often embarassing. Nice cover, though."
2,Is this a joke?,"I hope it is, because American poetry doesn't deserve to be treated like this. Forget about ""American poetry,"" actually; the English languga edoesn't deserve this. It's pretentious, hip to the extreme, and vapid."
4,Good enough blower,"Was sick of raking up the leaves twice every year from the live oaks in my front yard. Not only that, the trees shed leaves even in summer and in rain.I was looking for a leaf blower near $50. But, found this to be a good one due to the metallic impeller. The blower works OK for the most part. I only wish that when I pick up the leaves (from grass) it would pick up all of it.The bag is quite good.I wish I had purchased one without wires and with battery."
4,Great Item,The Toro Blower/Vac is great. The power is just right for either blowing leaves and grass or vacuuming. A high quality product.
5,Variagle speed blower/vacuum,"This product is very operator friendly, and with the metal impeller I don't have to worry about it being broken. Very good sucking power."
1,Good Machine but look out for the bag!,Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599Machine is everything that the company says about it but they lie about the zip of the bag and the bag itself being sturdy. In one seasonI've had TWO wear holes and the zips break . The machine is useless without a bag. They charge about $45 for a OEM replacement ... if you can find one! DH
5,Great Tool,This blower is very powerful but the variable control can change the blower action as desired. Easy to clean the garage at lower volume and completely clean driveway of pine needles and cones. I also use it to clean sand off the floor of the cars after visits to the beach.
4,Blower/Vac,"This item works quite well for the job intended, which is garden maintenance, especially for autumn."
3,Bag Sucks,"I got 1.5 seasons out of the bag. A hole formed in the bag at the point the blower blows in. I patched that. Now the zipper broke. The bags are cheap. Save yourself the hassle and order an additional bag, if you want to use the blower more than one year.The tool works well. It is very hard on the back. Best to blow them in a pile first, then vaccum them up."
2,Could be better,"I got this for Mother's day a couple of years ago, so I've gone through 2 fall seasons with it. I'm disappointed. The vacuuming part is good, but the leaf blower is not so good. It doesn't seem to have enough power to blow the leaves away in a steady stream. Once the leaves fly about a foot, they lose their push and fall to the ground. This is when it's turned up full force. It's almost impossible to blow leaves out from under shrubbery. I find it's easier to use the vacuum and just suck them out."
3,reliability,"I owned a Toro 51598 and it performed well for 2 seasons. the third season, it burned up and became landfill waste. It did work well, I must say and the bagging was easy.I own a Stihl chainsaw that is 20 years old and it still operates like a champ, so I purchased a Stihl leafblower this time around as I thought 2 + years was poor reliability.I didn't realize how much the cord got in the way and the Stihl performed perfectly this Fall. Time will tell if the Stihl will provide legendary reliability.Jim"
4,just awesome,Last year it took me about 10 hours to rake and bag. This year about 4. Nuff said. My only issue is that the bag is a bit small.
4,Toro 51599 Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller,Works well just don't try to vacuum up wet leavesA neighbor has a Black & Decker with a plastic propellerI just don't want to go through the hassle of a Black & DeckerReplacing the propeller every year if you vacuum up a rock or stick
1,Motor burned out after two seasons.,"Like many, my love affair with this tool burned out after two seasons of use mainly as a leaf vac.If you read the reviews, most five stars are written after initial use. With time the reviews go down, and result in one star as the motors fail.I was ""OK"" with this thing, never quite happy using it, but always liked the result. It worked best with small, dry leaves (birch, hackberry). Larger leaves (maple, oak) clog easily,especially when wet. I'm average height and always fought back pain using this. I developed work arounds. Ergonomics of this thing not good for avg to short persons.I might consider replacing with the new 51609, if I knew the motor had been improved for longer life. For now, I'm back to the old way - rake and scoop. It's faster, anyway."
5,Leaves be gone!,Excellent product. Am very glad to have purchased this as it's extremely efficient and easy to use. No more raking of the leaves. Bazinga!
5,hopefully as good,I had a Toro Blower/Vacuum for almost 11 years. It finally gave out and I purchased this Toro Ultra 12 #51599. I've used it twice and so far have found it quite satisfactory. It has enough power to blow over a tree!
4,good value for money,"blows really well.vacuum cleaner is adequate, may be somewhat underpowered, although it's expected for electrical blowers."
5,Moves leaves and gress just like it should!,It does exactly what you want it to do (move leaves and gress) with a lot of power. It's easy to use and not nearly as load as I thought it would be.
1,This product and TORO customer service sucks!!!,"This product was dead within 3 months & will not start. Called all the local service centers and was told they will not repair electric blowers (no wonder!!!). I called customer service & was told to pay for shipping to their service center, which made no sense as I am not ready to pay $10-15 for shipping on a $50 product.If the product worked for you then it's great, but if it dies, it's peace of junk. Spend your money wisely."
1,"Blow is just an expression, it don't suck for shi!!!!","After ten or so years of using both gas and electric blower/vacs, I can say it is the worst designed vacum I have ever tried to use. You can not make a good vacum by just turning a blower upside down, removing various parts that will get lost, and sticking a big cumbersom bag on it. If you really want a well designed blower/vac, try to find the Yardman model. It truely is a blower/vac that well designed and converts just by the flip of a lever."
4,make my leaves go away,"This blower/mulcher, vacuum pretty much works as advertised. The blower is quite powerful, while the vacuum is a bit tamer it too seems to work well. the canvas capture bag seems to fit awkwardly on my shoulder so i let it drag. the only complaint i have about this product concerns that collector bag, then again maybe it is the way i am built. The strap seemed to slip quite often making the unit itself awkward to handle"
4,powerful! - impressive so far,I have used this for about 2 hours both as a blower and a vacuum - works well so far with no problems. great as a blower. will need to spend more time to evaluate this as a vaccum. great price at amazon.
1,Vacuum is Poor,"I purchased a Toro to replace a Cosco purchased blower/vac that finally died after lots of use. That vacuum was excellent, but Costco no longer carried yard vacs. So, I purchased a more expensive Toro, thinking that I was buying a well-known yard product. Big mistake. The blower is great. The vacuum, which I need to pick up leaves as we have desert rock landscape is terrible. After a small amount gets in the bag, unless you empty the bag, the suction is no longer adequate. Plus, after only a few uses, the bag leaks air which is filled with dust particles. So, the user get filthy, and you definitely need to wear a mask. Very disappointing product."
4,Vacuum and blower combo,"This is a pretty nice blower, quite powerful, it's corded so no need to charge battery. Never used a blower before so I am blowing leaves, dirt and cut grasses everywhere, not sure how the gardeners do it, so I end up using the vacuum instead of blower for clean up."
4,Enough power for those who need an electric blower,"If you need more blowing power, then you need a gas blower. This blower is light and does the job of blowing grass clipping very well. Only use 50-75% of speed. Never used the vac portion. However, 4 stars because the cord could use some sort of locking/holding device. Have to tie knot with extension cord around cord stub on blower."
5,"This unit blows...... (that is, everything you point it at)!","I've only used this blower about five times and I think I'm influencing the weather around my property. Can't say I've actually created a ""cyclone"", but darn close. This things really can blow things out of the way. It seems a little noisy, but a set of earplugs takes care of that. I've also had trouble with the extension cord staying plugged into the blower. I have to use a small bungie cord to hold it in place when using it for long periods of time. I have not yet used the vacuum, but I'm sure it will work great also. I bought this item because it was a Consumer Reports Magazine recommended buy..... I recommend it also."
4,Good Blower,It is a good blower. However the sucking and shredding capability is limited and I did not use this feature
2,Very good Power,This item is good for the price. My biggest complaint only has to do with being attached to the electrical cord. I wish I purchased a gas powered blower instead.
2,"Toro Ultra: Mech Great, Elec Poor","This leaf blower/vac would get high praise from me if it weren't for two of them failing after just one or two seasons of use. The rheostat (power dial) is the culprit according to a local dealer/shop that noted that Toro doesn't offer a replacement. Once this component goes the rest is useless. Btw, Toro didn't even reply to my email. Once the warranty is up they show no interest. Beware of Sears Craftsman Model#74828; same unit, different handle."
2,"Great blower, not so great vacuum","I've had this product for approximately one year. As a blower it works great, very powerful. It has yet to fail me at blowing any debris off my patio or driveway. Unfortunately for Toro, I purchased this tool mainly for its vacuum feature. I attempted to use the vacuum almost exclusively on leaves and yard waste from mowing, and it regularly clogged up, requiring frequent stops to clear the tube. This made progress so slow that I eventually gave up using as a vacuum altogether. I also found the carrying position of the tool in the vacuum format very awkward and difficult to carry around for any length of time. Overall, not happy, and would not repurchase."
3,far better than expected - but short lived,"I ordered this blower/vac out of sheer frustration with gas motors that wouldn't start, or needed constant service. It proved to be more powerful, more versatile, and work better than I expected from it. It does a great job of blowing things clear, which is what I was really after, but when I gave it the first trial at sucking up and shredding leaves and debris, I was pleastantly suprised as well! HOWEVER, it should have lasted more than 2 seasons for the price.....Motor burned out mid Fall."
3,leaf bag,"The leaf bag got a hole in it the first time I used it. It was at the end of the day, so basically I spent $70.00 to use the product for a day since the replacement bags are $21.00! That is a rip off. They should make the bags stronger and the replacements cheaper. It works well, but definitelty not worth it because of the bags"
4,Great product for an excellent price,I have used it to blow leaves and then vacuum them it works great.If there is other stuff besides leaves that it sucks up it sometimes chokes but all we have to do is just reattached the vacuum and it works back great. Excellent product for this price.
4,Toro Ultra Leaf Blower,First Impression: Great job of blowing with one caveat. The air intake faces down and sucked on my shorts several times. I will get used to holding it slightly differently to avoid this in the future.
4,The Sucker Blows (in a good way),"I love this blower. It sure beats raking and bagging leaves. Why do that, when you can just blow them into the neighbors yard. I haven't tested out the sucking aspect of the blower as I have a sweet gum ball tree and that is how I fried my last blower. It just had a plastic impeller and a gum ball and lodged in there and burnt the motor up. I doubt it would do the same thing with this blower (because of the metal impeller), but I don't want to find out.I look forward to blowing my leaves with this blower."
3,Won't turn Off,"I have been using this model for a couple of years now and have no complaints except for the following: I have had two of these, the second was a warranty replacement for the first. The first one was replaced after about 16 months because it would not turn off unless I unplugged it. Now the replacement (about a year old) has the same problem. I wish Toro would fix the issue instead of just replacing them."
4,Great product for the money,I had the older model which I bought about six years ago and the motor finally gave way. I liked it enough to buy this one which for the cost is a great product. I would have given this product 5 stars except for this model doesn't have a clip to fasten in the extension cord so the extension cord may occasionally disconnect from the blower although making a knot where the two cords connect takes care of this pretty easy. This is a great product for the home. I wish it had a little more blowing power but you will probably need a gas blow to get much more powerful than this. Overall I am very happy with the product.
2,First year it was GREAT...all DOWN HILL since then!,"I bought this blower/vac because I read so many positive reviews on it. The first year it did work great, although the bag is tiny and with it and the cord, it was all sort of heavy. I kept the impeler cleaned out and cleaned it all up before storing it for winter. When I pulled it out for the 2nd leaf season it was like the motor action had been cut in half, barely blows any air out now. No way could I use it for a vac anymore, it totally lost its sucking power. I am now using it as a back up blower only for the lightest of jobs, keeping the leaves clear on my deck. No way can it be used like its intended! I really think they should rename it ""TORO WIMPY"" I wont be buying another one by TORO."
4,Toro 51599 review,"Product was good for the price. The Vaccum feature is a little cumbersome, but worked well in tandem with the rake. I will recommend this product."
3,It was good while it lasted,"when i got this leaf blower/vac, i thought it was ok in that it worked pretty well. with my height of 5'4"", i found it just a little too long, a little awkward to handle. not tall enough to keep it far enough off the ground sometimes. but using it as a vac, it is great for giving leaves their first shred before composting.i would have been far more satisfied, however, if i felt that i had gotten my money's worth. when i found yesterday (nov. 29,2012) that it was dead, i looked to see when i had gotten it. turns out i ordered mine in sept. 2010, it lasted til nov. 2012. about two months past the warranty period. i am of course disappointed, and not happy about having to replace at this time of year."
1,JUNK!! 1 use and it burned up!!,I was very excited about getting a leaf vac that would do gumballs. I emptied the bag 2 times. on the third fill of the bag the motor died. Apparently it does not like gumballs. too late to return. I'll have to check the manufactors warranty. very dissapointing
5,"Hilarious, as always!","Great season! If you love the show, you won't be disappointed. It's Always Sunny is always funny! =) Enjoy, bitches!"
3,Not the best season ever...,"This season played like one of those, ""it has it's moments"" comedies. Thankfully no laugh track added yet. The end."
3,It is an aquired taste,"While it is not my type of humor, it is an inventive, no holds barred with salty language style of humor and the the recipient of this CD Christmas present loved it."
2,Danny Devito has some funny one-liners,"Danny Devito's one-liners are the only funny thing about this episode. The rest of it is just disgusting. I needed a shower after watching what amounted to a string of grisly, and poorly thought out, sight gags. This show has been going downhill for a while but there are usually a few good episodes per season. I liked the actress playing the hooker but they didn't really give her any good lines. I know this show has always relied on a certain amount of crudeness, but when all you experience is one potty joke after another without wit or brilliant plotting in between, it just ends up falling on the floor. Glenn and Charlie and the rest of the gang could learn a thing or two from Larry David who uses just as much profanity and dark humour, but leaves you feeling that you've just witnessed brilliance and real comedic prowess. I'm a fan of the show overall so I guess I'll continue to buy these episodes as they come out, but I hope it gets better."
1,This is a strong contender for the worst sunny episode,"Save yourself the 22 minutes and skip this episode. We love Sunny, but we couldn't wait for this dreadful episode to get over. Come on guys, we understand that every show can't be a home run, but this one seemed like you phoned it in."
1,a shame,i think i neva seened this 1 b4. but peeps b talk bout it. a shame imissed it thearters. any yall no wear i get a bike i got 53 dollas ive been savin up but i dunno howw to get in the innrnet. is dat wut bankZ r 4? foreal but g2g LUNCH TIME lolool homsandwich n noodles.
5,All Sunny Fans Need This DVD,"This might be my favourite season of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. I have loved it from the very first episode and ""the gang"" seem to make each season, better and better.Just a clarifications that you might want to know if you are buying this DVD and you haven't seen any of the episodes of the 7th Season.- In the Jersey Shore episode, there is no appearance of the Jersey Shore cast. I thought there might be an appearance of maybe one of them, but the episode was literally just about the Jersey Shore location. It's still a very funny episode and one of the characters return for a guest appearance.They have great guest appearances and some of the moments of the 7th season are almost touching.Enjoy the DVD, it is one amazing season and I guarantee you will be laughing A LOT!"
5,NEED EXTRA BATTERY,"IF YOU WORK ALL DAY,YOU NEED A EXTRA BATTERY.A FULL CHARGE BATTERY IS 6 HOURS LONG."
1,Power Bug Swatter/Zapper,"Products were delivered on time. It did not work very well for flies from the beginning. At first, it would work moderately well for gnats. After about a week it stopped zapping them also. I changed the batteries thinking that perhaps that was the problem, but it still did not work with new batteries.I had hoped I had found the solution to the gnats, but unfortunately, it is junk."
1,you get what you pay for......,"I order 1 for us. It was a cheaper looking model than a friend of mine had, but I thought it was a cool thing. I ordered 2 more for my husband's father and my father. His father's didn't work and my father's worked one time then broke. I'm gonna pay the extra for the ""Original Bug Zapper"". It seems to be more durable."
2,"Fun, but not very effective; goes through batteries rapidly","This bug swatter gives a satisfying SNAP! when you swat a fly or wasp, and you can immobilize it in mid-flight -- very useful -- but the insect is often able to fly away after a few seconds, leaving you to follow up with an ordinary fly swatter, or shoe, or something.Also, I have only used it a few afternoons, and I am currently on my 3rd set of batteries, so it isn't very cost effective."
1,Doesn't Work!,"I own an old electric swapper and thought I'd upgrade to this one. I ordered one for my parents at the same time. Neither works. Tried different batteries - still not operating, and will be sending this back."
2,Cant keep it in tune,I have been playing guitar for about 10 years and never had a guitar that is untenable. It looks nice and a good quality craftsmanship for the price nice the neck and frets are all normal it’s just that it won’t tune and stay in tune I tune it and then start to play it and the tune is out I contacted the seller but haven’t heard back from them. Until I hear from the seller I have to give it 2 stars.
3,Pretty good guitar,"So I am a beginner. I needed a new electric guitar and wanted that hollowbody sound. Good price for an good guitar. Never played it on stage so I don't know its limits in that area. Other reviews say to change the strings and the pick ups. So do that if you got the time. If not, then just buy a better guitar.The paint looks good and the finish is ok. Sounds ok when plugged in."
5,Surprised!,"Must be a mistake!Dollar for dollar, this lens rates as possibly best among the many accessories I've purchased for my camera. I have the CP4500, which I bought about 4 years ago and although I have several other digital cams, including DSLR, the 4500 is the most used. It seems that a few years ago only the expensive version of this lens was available from Nikon, so I alternatively bought other (far more expensive than this one) brands. They were clumsy to use and produced disappointing picture quality. This lens is great! Built well and pic quality is excellent! Very happy to have found it, even so long into owning the camera. I can't say how it compares to the expensive version but for the money, it can't be beat.Pete V"
1,You better be sure this is the item you need,"I will never buy any camera item on Amazon again. You can not beat talking to a real person to make sure you are buying the right item. I have a Nikon Coolpix P5000 and this lens and adapter were supposed to be a fit for my camera. Well, they were not! About 8 hours later, after talking to the folks at Keeble and Shuchat Photography, I tried to cancel the order but it was too late. So, I refused the shipment and ended up getting only $30.00 back from my $75.00 purchase (including shiping, restocking fee). I couldn't be happier with the lens from the local camera store. I then when back and bought a speedlight from them."
5,"Linda...¡Ay, qué linda!","Linda Ronstadt es la Reina: Linda Ronstadt is the Queen!! What a beautiful, incredible voice!! This follow-up to ""Canciones de mi padre"" is full of classic, traditional Mexican music. Her vocal line is solid and she showcases her musical and vocal prowess on such gorgeous pieces such as ""Tata Dios"" and ""El crucifijo de piedra,"" two huapango jewels.There are so many wonderful Mexican singers, however, after Lola Beltrán, no one comes close to Linda Ronstadt. She is one of the most versatile and magnificent singers of this generation!!!¡Qué viva Linda!"
4,Better than I expected,"The handset lifter works better than I imagined it would - it's quick! While it's a little bulky on the side and almost did not fit my work phone correctly, I McGuyvered it and I can't complain about how it performs. Buy the CS-10 kit with the HL-10 included and send me a thank you note later."
3,"Works, but sometimes finicky","I've had this for over a year now, and it was relatively easy to install. I don't like the idea that I had to stick it to my current phone, so if I want to change phones, I'll have to find a way to un-stick the very well stuck-on lifter.However, its amazing to hear it working from my basement to the 2nd floor of my house.Sometimes, it over-shoots when hanging up the phone, and I have to adjust the lifter again(even though it was working fine for days before that)Overally, pretty decent - surprised at how well it works in such a techno-driven society - that such a simple concept actually does the job.I like it and would recommend it to others."
5,A must have!,"This is a MUST with the Plantronics wireless headset. It was easy to install and makes life so much easier at work. I researched prices all over the internet, and Amazon had the best prices for both the headset and the lifter."
2,Rock & roll teen idols,"A bit of this , a bit of that, quality not so good, songs are great but some of them are not even complete, you can see the cut when they change songs, like the Buddy Knox second song is not complete, a couple of other also,"
5,Rock 'N Rolls Teen Idols,It was good to watch my teenage idols sing and dance. The dvd brought back lots a memory. I loved every minute of the show.
2,Macbeth-Worst Acting I Have Ever Seen,"This version of Macbeth had the worst acting I have ever seen in any of the Macbeth plays. Some of the scenes were so [unreal] that you could see right through them. If you love this play and want to see a very good version of it, this is not the movie for you.I think if Shakespeare were alive to see this version he would have been most insulted and disappointed at the acting.I was very disappointed in this movie. I definitely would not recommend it to anyone. I would never rent or buy this version again."
3,flexibility but not as clear as orginal,I live that the headset offers the flexibility of beig over the head or just over the ear. However I am rather softspoken. I orginally purchasesd a used t10 headset nearly two years ago and it worked well with no issues. I was not a fan of the coiled cord with the orginal and it recently started to fray so I purchased this replacement headset. I notice my customers are not able to hear me as well with this headset and you have to have it lined up just right. I miss the earpiece on both sides but the single earpiece is not as much of a bother. It's mainly that I have to speak up much more with this headset then the orginal one that came with the phone.
2,Sound quality awful,This headset did not work well at all. I work for a work at home call center and people could not hear me when I talked. I had the volume all the way up on the phone and the headset both and I could barely hear them. I also like to have dual headphones. I would definitely not recommend this product.
1,Screaming Garbage,"Okay, you would think these guys could make a tight, cohesive metal album? How very wrong you are!!! I only listened to the sampler on amazon and I immediately get the impression that no one knows how to write a melody! It's crappy metal like this that makes crap like hip-hop and rap more popular with the kids and young adults. The only good thing about the CD is the band's name.If the lead singer could actually sing (and I use the term loosely here), it wouldn't sound so bad. However, the guy just screams like a child having a tantrum. Not very metal in my opinion. Hell, it's not even talented!All in all, I personally think metal bands today need to take a page from the 80's and 90's metal acts. People seem to like that type of music a lot more."
2,Smell Yeah...Reeks Of The Moolah Hustle...,"For you connoisseurs of metal art, and true originality in such, leave this alone. These guys played the name game to make a buck. You can't put a bunch of pit bulls in a room and expect them to crap in a purty pattern! Too many leaders. And, look at the name HELLYEAH!, What the hell is that? Might as well have named the band GOOBER COWGIRLS! It may work in the MORON market, which is sad. Maybe Kid Rock will open for them with his new CRAP!"
2,hell no.,"just because it has pantera members in it doesn't mean it's good.remember, pantera's reinventing the steel had pantera's members in it, all of them, and that sucked and so does this.biatch.if you want good pantera, listen to far beyond driven and the great sounthern trendkill."
3,Shipping took almost a month,"The product was in perfect condition, but I ordered this on November 30, and recieved it on December 23.Both attempts at contacting the seller for shipping details were met with no response."
5,Second Coming Of Panteraesque Muzic!!!,I have heard the released demo tracks on their website and the songs that I have heard have put me in a frenzy. This is definantly hard core old school rock that any pantera or mudvayne fan would love. I was amazed at how you can hear the pantera as well as the mudvayne sound throught out the tracks. I cannot wait for this to be released for this is a MUST HAVE!!!!!
3,just OK,The book is definitely not filled with technical knowledge but is useful for someone who is thinking of starting a nursery. If you are looking for reference manuals look elsewhere (I suggest The Reference Manual of Woody Plant Propagation). But if you want a book that will give you the Essentials on starting a nursery this book will give you some basic knowledge and help you decide what area of the industry you should pursue.
5,The otherside of the Nursery,"This book is not your typical ""grower"" book. It has little to do with actually growing, this is a business book. If provides you with details of the actual running of a nursery business that you probably have never thought of. If you are looking at starting a greenhouse/nursery/veggie stand etc this book would be a wise investment."
3,Some discs okay - but others are horrible!,"My daughter loves the Animal Field Trip game and the Arts and Crafts game. The Fundamentals game isn't as interesting for her - but it is probably a bit over her head (she is only 3). The Pet Playground game is horrible! There are only 2 games available - you have to play them many times just to buy a pet and then many more times to buy anything more for your pet (such as food, grooming supplies, etc). Plus, several areas of the game are locked out unless you have ""Jump Start World"" which costs up to $90! There is no warning or infomation on the box that implies that any additional purchases are needed to play the full game. I guess the 3 working discs we received were worth the $15 we paid."
1,$20 turns into $75 with no options,"I was very upset with this product. In order to even install the game, you are forced to go to their website and register requiring you give them your email address and childrens names. This name data is fed back to the game to create accounts on the local install.That's just the start. Turns out that there are really only a couple of small levels on the CD and that to get access to what would normally be a full version of a game, you must sign up for $8 monthly. Characters in the game tell your kids to ""get a membership online if you want to go further"".Freaking unbelievable."
4,"Good information, good pictures, lacks some detail","This book has good detail and coverage of the DC-9, MD-80, DC-10, and MD-11. However, there is not as much good detail on the very first DC-8s, especially the original turbojets. There also is not much detail on the MD-90. The text is generally good, although there are some factual inconsistencies. Overall, a pretty good book with some good pictures, but not a complete coverage of all Douglas types."
2,Reality,"Good job on the album.But I think that if you guys did not put on that accent then it would sound much better and more sincere.Next time try to be yourselves,we don't need to put on accents and try to americanise our music,lets just be real."
1,This is a total waste,"For Christmas, I purchased this item for my two and half year old son, who is fairly advanced for his age. The program is reccomended for 2-4. I was totally disappointed in this product. Before you begin to use the product, the child is given an assessment test, which was fairly good. However, it gave you the illusion that the program would be like that, when it is not. Your child is scored and based on the score, the questions are supposed to be geared toward the skills that the child does not know or needs improvement on. First of all the programs were difficult to understand for most adults (my husband and I are both college educated). Both my husband and myself sat down with my son and could not figure out the concept of the games. My son was easily bored with the product and seemed disinterested. He seemed to prefer some of his other computer software, (School Zone(preschool) and Disney for Toddlers. I would tell anyone to invest their money in another software."
1,Mixes up circles & ovals!,"I have the version that states it works with windows Vista as well. I have not yet gotten to the part where you have to purchase the on-line subscription to go past level 2, but I keep reading about it! If that's not bad enough, both the Advanced Preschool & the Kindergarten mix up circles and ovals and teach that they are opposite of what they really are! I called customer service three times, talked to a customer service person once who said he had vague rememberance of having heard of this problem once or twice, but was unaware of any patch or downloadable fix for this error. He said he would research it and call me back. I have not heard back after over a month. I also called after that two other times & left messages after being on hold for a long time, but never got any calls back. I bought both preschool & kindergarten as the 4 disc bundle pack (with bonus disc) at Costco & am planning to take them back!"
4,Excellent macro/micro illumination,"The accompanying instruction book is very complicated & hard to understand (for a novice). Once mastered, the product produces very reliable, good lighting for macro or micro work. BUT don't make my mistake...you only need an R1 if you have a D80 & some of the newer models (I think the D200) which have the capability of the controller unit (pictured on top of the camera) BUILT in. If you have a D40, or D70 & some other models then the R1C1 is needed. ALSO you have to go into the programming of the camera that has it built in (D80, D200) to make the correct settings for the control unit to fire the flashes. Overall, I'm very pleased with the thought and design. Plan to spend a good deal of time on the learning curve (where I am now)."
4,The kid loves the monkey,"Reasons why I like this show:1) We have several of the books that are episodes in the season.2) The 2 year old LOVE the ""Mumkee""I dont have any reasons to not like it but dont LOVE it enough to give 5 stars"
5,Excellent Resource,"""Introduction to Naval Architecture"" provides a unique approach to ship design. Although this approach is quantitative and mathematically ""intense"", Gillmer also provides qualitative description within certain chapters. Ultimately, for the purposes of clarity and a definitive understanding of basic ship design, this work is best coupled with ""Introduction to Naval Architecture"" (E.C. Tupper), which provides a ""descriptive"" perspective. The Gillmer and Johnson referenece is highly recommended for those individuals who have prior knowledge of naval architecture, and a strong foundation in mathematics; otherwise, the aforementioned coupling of two references becomes necessary.Please note: This is my opinion as a high school Senior completing an independent research project within the field of naval architecture."
5,Very Good,"This is a very good book. Not only does it contain a great deal of information about investigation techniques but the author also manages to convey, in great depth, the emotional aspects of the business. I definitely recommend this book."
4,RICH!,"This cake was a very rich chocolate in the middle.It was the family's first lava cake.So, if you love rich chocolate,this is for you.I am going to bake the next onelonger to please the family.It is very quick & easy to do,with a very good price!I bought this only for an occasionaltreat as we are attempting to eliminateprocessed foods.It just looked good, and it was!"
4,More nourishing some days than others,"I once took a book by Merton on retreat, having heard so many sermons praising his insights. It was a big disappointment. Merton seems, for me, at is best when talking about social justice issues. Otherwise, his piety is too intense for me.This book is designed for someone who cannot afford the time or money to go away on retreat. It is meant to provide enough food for thought and meditation for use at home. It succeeds in doing that, though some days are more nourishing than others.One of the best insights, which we need to remind ourselves over and over again, is that we are called to be ourselves, not someone else. Also, the desire to please God does in fact please God and that `All we need is to experience what we already possess'. `Without some sort of solitude there is and can be no maturity' and we need `to be converted over again each hour.'"
4,look for it,Mary Roberts Rhinehart was at one time as popular as Agatha Christie. She's a forgotten mother of literary suspense in America. I got into Rhinehart when I was a teenager reading old gothics and suspense paperback from the library. The biography is not exciting but it's a solid and overdue look into the life of a literary phenomenon.
4,Does it do what it's supposed to?,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep, so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders, there is no book overhang over the edge, due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
4,I like it,The workout itself is fun and makes you work. I love doing this workout. My one complaint is that the audio for her voice is no louder than the background music. It is sometimes really hard to hear what she is saying. I wish there was an option to turn off the music.
5,So much fun!,"This dvd is amazing, I've never done a workout that was so much fun before. I love how fast the hour goes by. The instructor is great and gives all the right reminders. I'll admit though, this isn't for people who've never exercised before. It's super hard, but worth it. I've already noticed a difference in my endurance after doing this dvd only five times in the past two weeks. Also there is some great instruction before the workout even starts on how to punch and kick correctly in all the different forms she uses in the workout. I don't think there could be a better kickboxing dvd out there."
4,"Great content, difficult to copy format","The album provides the musical content promised, however the DVD format is problematic. It will not play on a CD player and is very difficult to transfer to any mp3 application. It can be done, but takes a lot of research and doing."
5,The Best Blank On The Market,"I love these blanks, they are as close to perfection as you will get. I use to purchase them from a business that has gone out of business and worried that my copying woes were back. But I've found hope here on Amazon because they have just what I need. Even named brands will fail to finalize many times and I copy on the run many times. I can honestly say that I can count the failure of the TDKCD-R80TWN Music CDR on one hand. If you don't won't issues with your copying, buy this CD.Sam"
2,Disappointing,"In the past I have purchased TDK Music CD-Rs for use in a TEAC turntable with build in CD recorder. In trying to use these new TDK Music CD-Rs, the CD recorder does not recognize the discs. As a previous reviewer noted, these CD-Rs are not the same as the older TDK white label CD-Rs. I don't know what they changed, but the quality is lower."
4,World of Brazil,I think this is a really great CD. I loved all of the songs. The music is very relaxing.
5,Perfect,"I am a plus size woman who is VERY active and this is a real treat for me. An accessory that fits around my arm. It is plenty big for anyone I would think, and comfortable too."
2,Weightlifters beware.....,"I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons. First, I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt. That wasn't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve. But then I went to wear it for a run, and the arm-band was too small for my arm! I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training, but nothing outrageous. I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users. This is unfortunately not the case. So if you have larger than average biceps (say 17"" amd up), save your money...."
1,Not happy,"I bought this phone as a gift for my parents who are getting older and need the larger keys to see, but dont want all the other functions like an answering machine. It stopped working within a couple of days and i had to return it. Cheaply made product."
5,The Teutels behind the TV show,"This book is easy reading, you have no problem in understanding even if English is not your mother tongue. With this book you learn a lot about the private Teutuls. How they experienced the sudden fame and the show on TV. You can read about the live of Senior before, about all what he had to deal with and you hardly can believe that he made it to what he is today. Many other would have capitulated. You get a big glance behind the family of the TV show. A must have for all Teutul and chopper fans."
2,Big disappointment,"I'm not quite sure what I expected from this book, but it didn't live up to any expactations. The story is almost staccato, simply written and it's not captivating for one moment.Might be OK if you could borrow or hire it, but definately not worth your money..."
3,stupid mistakes mar enjoyable book,"It's disappointing and disturbing that three Teutuls plus two Zimmermans and an additional army of fact checkers and editors at Warner Books could let obvious errors get printed.On page 11, Paul Senior talks about his parents charging people to park in their driveway on Cooper Street in Yonkers, to watch horse races in Yonkers Raceway or baseball games in Yankee stadium, which were within ""walking distance.""While the track is just a few blocks away, the stadium is about 8.5 miles south. The 17 mile round trip is not ""walking distance"" for most people. I hope he calculates more precisely while building bikes.Twice on page 15, Senior mentions his house in ""Muncie"", New York. Muncie is in Indiana. The Teutuls lived in MONSEY (which is pronounced like Muncie).There are probably more errors, but I just started reading the book."
4,no compliants,I like the variety of color and the sponges are a lot of fun. Cleans up well. My son seems to enjoy it a lot!
2,franciscan,"It is important to remember that this book is a novel and not an authentic biography. As a novel it is a easy read, but not something I would recommend for formation."
4,Thrilling Story from the Beginning to the End,"Although,this sort of stories,are mostly unbelievable,is there still a basis for believing,realizing,that I guess,there are still people who think and feel themselves out of this world,anyway,Haylie Duff is really perfect,she plays very good in this role,as do most of the group,who go to thewoods for a paint-ball game,but they are soon in big trouble,with the big ""family"" as I might call them like this.The only thing,that is in my eyes not that good,is that almost everyone from the group dies,and certainly the most disturbing,the end,you must see it for yourself,but despite of a few minus parts,if you like such movies,highly recommended!"
5,Nothingface blow away the metal scene with Skeletons,"I'm a huge Nothingface fan. I never tire of listening to Everyday Atrocity, Violence or Pacifier, but I must say that Skeletons shows incredible range. Some call this album a softer release and it may be, but Matt's vox are so well developed that you won't care. I think to truly appreciate this album, you have to listen to all of the albums in the order of their release date. You'll see the changes that have gone on, but I have yet to hear one bad song by this band. My favorites are Beneath, Murder is Masterbation, Scission and Patricide. Definately pick this up, it's what real metal should sound like, no gimmicks, just soul and emotion."
4,This highly anticipated album doesn't disappoint,"I truely think Nothingface are one of the most underrated bands in the industry. But they do seem to maintain a pretty loyal fan base. This is probably because each one of their albums stays inside the same spectrum as the last. Nothingface haven't been corrupted by the Mtv generation, so they maintain a pretty recognizable and solid sound, without lessening their efforts to make a more commercialized brand of music. That's why Skeletons is an awesome album, just like the previous three albums released by them. If I were to compare the last albums to Skeletons, I'd say Skeleton's offers the creepiness and melody of Violence with the aggression of Pacifer. Definitely one of the albums of the year fore me."
5,works great,"Length:: 0:08 Minsi got this for my grandma, along with the easi twist jar opener, and they work great together.because if she's not strong enough to grip the jar, then she's probably not going to be able to grip the lid.the sologrip holds the jar in place and then the opener provides grip and leverage on the lid.i considered electronic jar openers like the one touch and the black & decker lids off. from what i read, the one touch seems to break easily and the lids off looks too complicated for someone that old. plus i think it's better for her to use her hands and arms a little.it's very sturdy and well built. i picked this one over the ""spill not jar and bottle holder"" because it looked easier to use and the youtube video demonstrated how easy it was to use on a variety of jars."
2,order was canceled,"my order was canceled after a couple of days so i didn't receive the product, but they were prompt in returning my money."
3,Does it work,"First Coffee Vac purchased 2 years ago and still working great. Recently purchased second Coffee Vac 3 weeks before my friends birthday and it would not hold a vacuum. Amazon would not allow a return or credit because it had been just over 4 weeks before we requested an exchange, or refund. My friend, the coffee lover, was so disapointed that I decided to purchase one more Coffee Vac hoping it would work. No such luck. That coffee vac was also defective. It would not shut off or hold a vacuum. I believe they have a quality control problem and I lost financially. I defiantly would not purchase another Coffee Vac."
4,it works.,It works as advertised. Air tightness I believe can be improved. The internal volume is still inadequate to store a regular bag of beans I bought from COSTCO.
3,"It broke, but after 2 years.","We've had this a couple of years and, other than having to change batteries, it's worked like a charm. Kept my coffee super fresh. But last week, it stopped keeping a seal. On close inspection, I discovered that the outer canister is cracked. It hasn't been dropped, just appears to have worn out. Some folks won't mind having to replace this every couple of years, but not me. Switching to the Vacuvin cannister, which includes a manual pump (no more wasting batteries for something I can do myself). Hopefully it lasts longer than 2 years..."
5,Don't Understand Bad Reviews,"Reviewers have suggested that suction is lost over time or that the unit consumes batteries at a fast rate.I have found neither to be the case with my newer, timer-equipped model. The unit maintains suction and bean flavor, and battery life (I use rechargeable batteries) is good. I have the timer set to its least frequent option for evacuating the canister and consider that fine for my purposes.Overall, the product does exactly what it says it will, without any of the problems some other reviewers seem to have encountered. I would not hesitate to recommend it to others."
1,Great concept - poor execution,"The idea of vacuum sealing coffee to keep it fresh is great. However, this canister creates a vacuum that lasts for an hour or two and then is gone. There is a button that will allow it to automatically renew the vacuum every 12 hours. However, that leaves the coffee without a vacuum for the bulk of the day. I could have gotten a silver-colored canister with an air-tight lid for about $5 and saved a lot of money. This is not a worthwhile purchase!"
1,leaks down all the time,"nice idea, but doesn;t work. I wish another company would make a electric bean vac. Pump runs and vacuums it down.. 2 hours later button is up meaning vacuum is gone. tried cleaning seal and all of cusr services suggestions.. No difference. Sent it back to Amazon"
2,queso,"Party Fun Action Committee is Def Jux's first wack release in my opinion. Up until this one, their release schedule was flawless. I mean...I know this album is supposed to be joke, but honestly who is entertained by this other than the people that made it. When I spend my hard earned money on a CD, I expect to listen to it more than once. Blockhead is still a dope producer so, I'll give this 2 stars."
5,Easy to Understand,Good study guide that is easy to read. Nice sample questions at the end that can help prepare one for the exam.
2,It takes all sorts,"I bought this thinking that this would help me blaze through the studying. Her approach is based on memorization and, to some, this is all that is needed to help pass the exam.This did not help me at all as her technique did not suit my way of thinking and learning.Here is my approach:a. go over the PMBOK, paraphrase the sections that you learnt in note form.b. Understand the relations between the processes; connect them together in your mind.c. Read Kim Heldman's book on the sections you just read.d. Answer exam questions (available on the web and from PMI) on the sections just read.e. Feel good about getting it right. If you didn't get it right, go back and redo the whole section again.f. Go to the next topic/process and iterate from step a.Remember, the more exam questions you get right in this time, the better your chances."
4,This is a good book.,"I used this book + PMP Exam: How to pass on first try, plus PMBOK to pass on my 1st try.This one is good but I think the other one is slightly better."
3,Representative of the exam,"I was not crazy about this book, but I have to admit it was very representative of the exam. The study guide portion of each topic was a useful summary. My main problem with the book (and the PMP exam) is that too many of the questions were overly subjective and depend on the particular organizational context. It would have been more beneficial to have even more discussion of the answers, especially when choosing between the best of several correct answers."
3,Okay but not as good as.....,"While this book is good, I found that Andy Crowe's book, How to Pass the PMP on the First Try, was far more helpful. I used these two books and did pass on the first try. However, Mr. Crowe's book is presented in a more logical sequence and seems to be more straightforward.The two together were certainly better than just one but if I had to choose one over the other, Mr. Crowe's book would be my choice.Good luck!"
2,Not for me,These don't have anything to keep them on your thighs.. they don't stay up all day.. I wouldn't buy them again
3,another boring Fantasy novel,"I slogged through this book to the end, although I don't know why. I bought it at the airport to pass the time, and it did pass the time better than looking out the window... but only barely. This is clearly the tired end of a five book series, and the author was either simply fulfilling contractual obligations or was sick of the characters.I gave it more than two stars as it skips the usual mysogeny present in violent fantasy, gives women real roles, and doesn't pretend that sex has no effect on life. Other than that, the story is a predictable bore, and the only main character who dies is under-developed.As a disclaimer, I haven't read the other four books in the series, so I may be missing the real point of this novel - to tie up loose ends. If you're curious about how things turn out, I suppose that might justify reading the book outside the library."
4,Voices of the Faithful,The daily devotions of people all around the world are astonishing. They make me want to go out every day and proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Great Read!
1,Horrible,"This gun is HORRIBLE you pay 50 dollars for the worst gun.the FPS isn't 230 its more like 150 FPS. The Clip size is only 16 bbs and you blow it in 5 seconds. Also the gun has a very short area of short. The only good thing about the gun is the design but everything else SUCKS, DO NOT BUY!!! And the HOP UP SUCKS TO!!!!"
1,Not a great stove,I am not happy with my Bosch gas free-standing convection range. One burner keeps clicking after I turn it off. This forces me to disconnect the stove. I just had it fixed for $200 a couple of months ago and now it is broken again. My advice: don't buy one!
4,Good,"The purchase/exchange went just as it should. The lid on the cage, however, is more difficult to release from its latch than it should be."
4,Best of Intentions,"This song is so sweet. It is a slower ballad, but the lyrics are very sweet. Travis Tritt sings and delivers the song very good."
5,Choc full of suspense and romance,"It is a pity that this book was not reprinted under Tom Huff's pen name - Jennifer Wilde - as this was the last gothic style book Tom Huff wrote which almost branches out to the historical romance which Wilde was famous for. So it's probably a mission trying to find a copy but it is worth the read. The actual story is set in 19th century India and the main character finds herself lost in the jungle escaping dreaded worshippers of Kali, who kill their victims with yellow scarfs for the goddess of death and destruction. This is filled with exotic color and excitement - a dash of mystery - a brooding hero and an intelligent heroine. If you like those old gothics and historical romances, it is definately worth finding a copy."
2,Flush-cut saw.,"This saw falls into the category of ""You get what you pay for."" When I looked at this saw I thought, ""Hey, this is just what I've been looking for, and for around $25.00."" The trouble is that it stayed sharp for only a fraction of the jams that I had to cut. I should have bought something decent. It may have cost a little more money, but I would have had something that was actually useful. As it is, I have a toy and not much more."
1,Bought 2 of these so I had a backup and it's a good thing I did.,I guess it all comes down to disposable electronics and the location where this was made. The first one failed in less than 3 months. Don't waste your money on this.
5,90W Adapter Cord,"I received this product the first time, very quickly I might add and worked so well I purchased another. Now I have a back up for the next tiem. Thank you, Karen"
5,Ac adaptor,"I actually bought two of these,; one for the office and one for home. They arrived quickly and have performed well. I had bought replacements previousy form another source and after a time, arter being wound up and put in my computer carry case many times, the wires failed."
4,Shostakovich's SQ #8 Live along with Beethoven's Grosse Fuge,"These are live performances from the Borodin String Quartet doing music of Shostakovich and Beethoven. Each work, it would seem, is essential in the string quartet repetory. The performances of these works is very good, but probably not the best on the market although to have both of these works on one CD is certainly tempting for the amateur and collector both. Unfortuately the total timing on this CD is less than 50 minutes which is probably why this CD when I got it was marked down three times and which I bought for pennies on the dollar new and sealed. Other than the poor value for the money this CD is very good and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the combination of the great Shostakovich string quartet No.8 and Beethoven's Grosse Fuge, op.133."
3,It's OK.,"For the price of the item, we were disappointed that it is all made of pressed board. It looks OK, but it is not of good quality. We also found that it came poorly packaged. The first shipment of the TechCraft never even reached us because it was damaged during shipping. When we finally received the 2nd shipment, the corners were damaged on the box -- thus the TV stand corners themselves were slightly damaged. It was mostly in the back where it doesn't show, and as we needed it for the holidays, we decided to keep it---but still good packaging would have helped made us more satisfied customers."
5,Great product,"HAVE 2006 JEEP LIBERTY, THIS REAR LIGHT COVERS FIT GREAT AND LOOK GREAT, WAS A GREAT BARGAIN FOR THE PRICE. GOOD DEAL FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO SPUCE UP THEY VEHICLE."
3,A decent movie,"This movie is drasticly overpriced, but if you can find it in a video rental place, rent it. To be honest, I was surprised. I am a big De Young fan, and rented this because of it. I think this to be his second best role. Robert Beltran did well also."
4,Works well enough!,"The Nady MPM-4130 was purchased to replace a VERY old TOA powered mixer used solely to rehearse vocals prior to gigs. Comments on other sites regarding overheating and blown fuses might be explained by mismatched Ohm input - the Nady can handle two 8 Ohm loads from speakers to create a 4 Ohm load overall. The DSP effects work relatively well, and volume is not a problem in a rehearsal room. All in all, the little Nady 4-channel works well enough for what it is designed to do, and for its low cost."
3,"Very Good Product, Bad Shipping",Really works well to soften clothes and smells great. But I will buy at the local store in the future due to leaky bottles in UPS shipping.
2,Bottle Opener is bad,"The blade is great for packages or cheese, but the bottle opener is awful. At first, I thought I was using improperly and then went on Buck's site for directions- nothing. It will stay on my keyring, but I'm not thrilled about it. What is the knurled eddge on the bottle opener for, fish scaling?"
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I ordered this mainly due to a low budget, thinking I could use these as room mics for a live sound. Although they are listed on Amazon.com as omnidirctional mics, they work well as unidirectional, barely picking up any sound more than a foot away from the mic. And don't forget you need phantom power. Some reviews here complained that the mic level was quiet. Indeed it was, but phantom power helped a lot. Overall, live on a PA system, these mics fare with probably any low-mid range mic. They don't feel cheap, and I like the on/off switch. I have seen much worse for much more, so if you're tight on money but need a decent mic for your own projects, this could be the one for you."
3,Get what you pay for,"I bought these for my karaoke machine about 7 months ago and am just getting around to review. They both worked fine, for about 4 months. Not sure what exactly happened, but come 4th of July, I have a karaoke party, and 1 of the mics just doesn't work anymore. I pulled it apart, put it back together - no go. Kind of a bummer when you've got 20 people in your house ready to karaoke."
3,"Cheap price, decent mic","For the price, this can't be beat. We needed a microphone for our reception, and this one performed well. For $15, what more could you want?"
5,The kids love it !,"I got this to use for our family. It is just fine for normal family needs for home, reunions, etc. I'm pleased with the product."
1,"Stopped working within 4 months, only used for 2 parties.","How disappointing! Bought this for Christmas/New Year's and when we went to use it for a birthday party 3.5 months later it was kaput. Seemed fine while it lasted, but beware. This not a good product."
3,"Great Mic, Lousy Cable","I ordered this and very pleased with the microphone-- would have given it 5 stars, but the cable had a short. I returned it and got another-- SAME PROBLEM! I am keeping the mic and buying a new cable- all in all, I can't complain that much because of the low price; but the product should work when it comes out of the box. In the end, it is a decent low-cost mic with a piece-of-junk cable..."
2,Don't Waste Your Time...,"I agree completely, the first day I had it it was amazing, I unplugged it from the amp and left it off on the mic stand overnight and the next day I had to put my mouth ON the mic and scream to to get a muffled sound."
5,The mic rocks!,It really is a great microphone. I like it because it is really sensitive to your voice. I don't have to scream in it to hear myself.
3,Goes with Ukelele Review,Works good when you've got the switch just right but sometimes it's tricky. Wish I would've bought a smaller one to just clasp on a shirt . Oh well!
1,Good for a day,"this mic worked well for a day, and then it just suddenly lost it's sensitivity, and you have to practically shout into the mic to get any sound."
3,Product Review,"The microphone works well but I had to replace the cord that came with it. After one night of use, the cord had a loose connection somewhere and the sound was cutting in and out."
4,Nice Surprise,We bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long. I hope it does because this nady sp-4c is a very impressive mic for the price. We our using it with our Roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a Roland micro cube also. I would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose.
3,Not bad for the price,"You get what you pay for. I bought this for karaoke, and it works fine for that purpose. The only issue is the plug for the cord is loose, so if you don't hold it tight (or tape it down, I guess), the sound will cut out. If I could buy again, I'd stick with a microphone with a non-detachable cord"
1,I would not purchase again,"This microphone arrived soon after I ordered it, but it had NO packing material to protect it. The plastic material used for shipping would have been perfect, but certainly did nothing to protect this item from any bouncing or dropping etc. during shipping. Bottom line is that I had paid over $8.00 in shipping and handling to purchase it and another over $8.00 to return it. That was more than the cost of the item itself! It never worked from the first time we tried it. I think I should have been reimbursed for this thing entirely. I would not recommend this to anyone. Go to a different store if you need one and you won't have to deal with Nady Systems."
1,Terrible,You can barely hear it and the cord broke in about 2 weeks. Need I say more?Save your money and buy another mic for 30-40 bucks.
2,This book is a mixed bag,"This was useful in getting practice on how the exam is structured and the basic content. I found some errors in the answer keys, though, so don't rely on this review as the definitive source. Toward the back of the book many of the practice exams were extremely outdated and not useful at all. Would not recommend."
5,Good stuff,This product can really help with canine oral hygiene! Cuts down on gum inflammation too! I use it on both my little dogs. They don't love it but they tolerate it. Definitely easier than brushing.
4,Tolerable,I have a small dog and after the recent teeth cleaning by our vet to the tune of $400 I figured any attempt to clean teeth would be better than nothing. I've always brushed my dogs teeth so I was disappointed that I wasn't doing enough to keep the tarter at bay. This oral rinse is very different and a bit challenging to use at first. My dog wasn't too keen on the long plastic tube and I've figured out that it's best to have the liquid nearly to the tip of the tube before inserting it in my dogs mouth. If I don't have the liquid in the tube the amount of air blowing in my dogs mouth leads her to shy away from it. All it takes is a quick squeeze on either side of the dogs mouth and you're done! My dog doesn't seem to be bothered by the taste if there is one. Overall I'm hoping that this well help keep my dogs teeth cleaner but I won't really know until next year.
2,Not recommended for cats...,"I used this on a two year old Maine Coon male with little success. Despite treating according to instructions, his gums remained irritated and red. When treated, he started coughing, much like clearing a furball. This caused us to stop using this product and switch to the CET mix with water. That has worked great."
3,good case study,"I found the chapters are not very in detail. I was using it as the textbook and the lecture notes are way better. I read the book at the begginning but stopped in the middle as it doesn't really help. However, the end of chapter case studies are pretty good."
3,Just same old story,I am using this book for a business valuation class now. Nothing but a binding many buzzy theories. Too many stories in a limited pages. This is not a good book for those who wants to deepen understanding of one subject.
2,Not a Panacea for Air-blown Popcorn,"I wanted this product to be great. I yearned for this product to be great. It turned out to be fair.If you use the recommended serving size, you'll find you don't taste is AT ALL. Nada. Zip.If you use three times the recommended serving, you'll find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar, and I do mean subtle. You'll have to hunt for the flavor. Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor. You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.Oh well. The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit. Too bad!"
1,kindle version,I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in the Kindle version of this book.I just bought my Kindle and there are a considerable amount of mispelledwords. The book however is a great book but I would advise reframing from purchasing the kindle version.
3,not enough real world examples,This book is kinda ok. It gives basic understanding of how WebSphere works. But this material is absolutely insufficient to help developers working with the product. I would probably better spend money on smth else.
2,Cable shorted in 5 months,"I purchased two of these cables five months ago when I expanded my set-up. I run a Mackie 802 board to a Mackie/Thump SRM1801 sub (this was my new addition) to two Mackie SRM450v2. I have used the cables once per week and have always taken good care of them during set-up, breakdown, and storage. A couple of weeks ago one side of the speakers starts channeling static and distorting the sound. I start checking my connections and wherever I moved one particular Nady cable, the distortion and static followed. I wonder when the other will fail... Proceed with caution."
5,Excellent learning remote at a great price!,"Was tempted to buy a Philips, Sony or some other more famous brands, but decided to give One4All a try. And I'm happy to say I didn't regret my decision. Aside from the built-in device codes, I use this extensively for learning. And this model supports between 50-70 learning commands, far more that some others that I have tested before. All in all, worth every penny!"
3,Is something missing?,"This book has a very imaginative story and is wonderfully illustrated, but I could not help but wonder if my book was missing pages. No missing pages, just very clipped story that prevents this book from truly engaging readers. The story reads as though Dorros produced a great tale, but an over-zealous editor got ahold of it and scratched out the magic that would make this story flow. There is so much more story that could have been included that could have made this an engaging story. Instead, the story is rather rough (over-edited?) and then comes to an abrupt halt at the last page. Even my 4 year old was left wondering, ""What did I miss?"" It is really too bad. There is so much potential in the story and illustrations. I will keep my eyes open for Dorros' books in the future, but I will check them out from the library before buying them. I just hope the author's editor allows more of a developed and fluid story to make it to the book shelves."
4,Dance with Lisa really works!!!,"Dance with Lisa is a great workout video. I bought the intermediate version and I think it may be a little difficult for people who have never tried Latin dancing. The down part is she teaches the steps very quickly and she doesn't go over transitioning from one step to the next but if you have a rewind button you'll be fine. Other than that the dances are really fun and up beat, the variety never lets you get bored. But most importantly after going through one of the dances you will feel like you had a really good work out without feeling exhausted and you'll have fun doing it. I personally love it!!!"
5,easy to set up.,I had it set up and going in 5 min. the (install) disk let me get up and running in 5 min. I purchased the wireless because i didn't want to run all the cables.Both my kids love it. Me Too
1,Ugly,"This was a really ugly product, it stopped transmitted when I was on the phone near by it, slow connection speeds, and it was not realible. Altough all those things it was a first generation product so you cannot expect the best rite away."
3,50-75 feet max range,"This product is an adaptation of the popular Linksys instant wireless network card for laptops. Laptops are subject to greaterflexibility of positioning than PC's. I pushed this product to the max. In a large mid tower case, on the floor, in an armoir, facing away from the access point, through several walls,closets, bookcases,appliances and about 100 feet away from the access point, I got a signal strength of about 0-6% at best.When I moved the PC to the living room, 50 feet away,no armoir, still on the floor,oriented towards the WAP11 I got 70% and a good Internet connection. So I returned the WMP11 for a WUSB11usb adapter. It is easier to install, requires no power cord. It can be elevated to the ceiling if you wish, while leaving the PC ""in the armoir where it belongs""-wife talking. I set it on topand got a 26-40% reading -enough to go! So I would only recommend this card for PC's at desktop level less than 80-90 feet away from the source."
3,WMP11 and BEFW11S4 Combo,"I just finished installing the WMP11 on a Win98 computer using the BEFW11S4 router. My other computer (win2k) is WIRED to the BEFW11S$ router. I followed the quick install for the router and it worked PERFECTLY. I did not even have to reboot my computer at all. The next computer (win98) that is using the WMP11 had a little problem. I followed the directions of installing the software first which ran smoothly. Hardware installation was also fine. But after I turned on the computer, it would not recognize the connection. I opened the program and had to REFRESH a lot of times before it would say i have a 72% signal. And once in a while the connection would drop and i would have to go back and refresh and even go back to change the settings to the exact same settings for it to work again. I read other post where they upgraded their firmware. I have not done so yet but I will keep you guys updated. Internet works fine w/ the WMP11 but it doesnt feel reliable."
3,Hard to install,"I found out that the one thing you should not do is install the thing using the linksys setup. Instead (win xp)go to the 'add hardware' section, look for new hardware and install it using that driver in correspondance with the linksys one."
5,A Wonderful Book,Here All Dwell Free may be an awkward title but it is right on. Mueller Nelson has an exquisite but powerful and compelling way of presenting complex and important psychological information so that anyone can understand and benefit.This book pulls one into that mythical land with devils and angels entirely compatible with any religious conviction because she is addressing archetypal issues which all humankind must address or avoid. Mueller-Nelson convinces one to take the risk of looking at one's dark side and points the way to the many individual and social benefits of taking one's life seriously. Another benefit is the lovely prose which leads one deeper and deeper into one's own inner world. Anyone interested in their religious and spiritual life will benefit and enjoy this remarkable book.
3,Okay,Really enjoyed her on Rockstar Supernova but not as impressed with the CD. Hope she puts out something else to compare to.
3,It's definately listenable,"I watched Rockstar:Supernova for my Rock-n-Roll Goddess Storm Large (of Storm and the Balls) and was surprised to find that there was another lady worth rooting for. Dilana's fierce delivery of songs on that show (Zombie & Lithium to name a couple) doesn't come across as strong on the CD, but that is not to say that the CD is bad. It is pop music - Dilana seems to write pop songs - but her delivery is made for rock-n-roll. I'll agree with another reviewer in that she needs to work more with a songwriter, but from a delivery and presentation perspective, she's got the goods. I'm looking forward to the CD that Gilby will produce for her."
2,Turn up the volume,"Purchased these headphones for my son to use with his portable CD/MP3 player. The sound was ok but the headphones are not very efficiant. To hear enough sound, you had to turn the volume all the way up. Even with the volume up high, the headphones just did not deliver."
3,what is lange amounts of data?,"it's a good drive for large amounts of data. However, I have had terrible luck using this drive to back up lange amounts of data. If you're using the drive for that purpose, you might want to look into some other options."
3,Surprisingly amateur,"I am disappointed by this book. I am left with the impression that the photographer simply didn't spend enough time in the woods. Some of the photos are quite stunning, but the majority of them are not. The lengthy captions only add to this impression. They often try to excuse lackluster images by lamenting the difficulty of the hike, the fact that his equipment malfunctioned, and how the weather didn't cooperate. Those are things anybody who's taken a hike with a camera has experienced. As a professional, his job is to spend the long hours to get perfect shots, discard the imperfect ones, and then not moan about how difficult the whole process was. It is also disappointing, to someone who knows the Adirondacks well, that the photographer limited his outings to the most accessible and popular summits. The views from these summits are wonderful to experience first hand, but as published photographs they border on cliché."
2,Nothing Great!!,This is good for one time or maximum two time use. Nothing great really. It was actually a waste of money .
4,Good for what it does,I'm a little fussy about the cleanliness of my system. This does the trick. The lint-free clothes are particularly useful.
5,3M Keyboard Cleaner system works well,I used this product against a circa 1995 keyboard. The solution and pad removed all the grime very easily. Plenty of solution is provided. I'd guess there's about 4-5 keyboards worth of solution in the bottle.
5,OEM works fine,"It is the OEM charger, so it functions exactly the same as the one that came with my motorola RAZR"
3,everything you need... except the door poppers,"This kit lacks the door poppers needed to open the doors, if you go on the companies web sight it shows that they are included but they are not. Other then that the kit worked as it should but gave very poor information on how to set it up to do anything other then open the doors leaving two buttons and 5 channels unused."
1,Author should stick to scholarship not memoirs,"A poorly written memoir of how, in the late 1960's, a nerdy philosophy teacher, Franklin Lears, changes the life of Mark Edmundson, a high school football tough with few future prospects. Even though Edmundson himself became a professor of English at U of Virginia and a prizewinning scholar as a result, this memoir veers frequently and wildly off the potentially interesting theme of the story into incoherent ramblings about high school life at the bottom of the intelligence chain. He even misses the opportunity of seeking out Lears as an adult to let him know the profound impact he had on at least one student during Lears' first and last year as a high school teacher. This book, which received a moderately positive review in Newsweek, turned out to be a real disappointment."
2,Too scholarly for an inspirational tale,"I love memoirs about teaching and so was anxious to read another inspirational tale about a remarkable teacher. Unfortunately, by page 50, little had been said about Franklin Lears and a lot had been said about the school, the students, and particularly the author. This probably would have been fine had the book not been written in such a scholarly, pendantic fashion. The writing is dry, better suited to academic papers than an inspirational book."
1,Academic dishonesty,"Edmundson's belligerence comes across in this book. He passes quick judgments on the academic establishment, traditional teachers, traditional parents, students that follow the rules, and traditions. What's lacking is a real feeling for the people, places, or times of the 1970s. He rarely connects with those around him, and when he does there's the uncomfortable feeling that he's making the subjects into something he desires them to be rather than what they are. It's a sad read for that reason. A few examples: he lashes out oddly at female students, who have rejected him for various reasons. I think that comes across clearly at several places in the book. He sexualizes people and places at weird times which is just a little offputting, especially because he's extraordinarily judgmental. He loves fighting apparently."
2,"All action, no plot","*Spoiler*So Angelina Jolie is exposed as a Russian agent...spends most of the movie running from her coworkers at the CIA because she swears she's not. Then she kills some guy as her duty to a Russian agent. She then watches her husband get killed by the Russians. Then she kills all the Russian agents. Because the Russians killed her husband she wants to kill them all. So the very gentle nuance is that she let go of 20 years+ of loyalty because her husband was killed. Oh, and one of her CIA coworkers is also a Russian Spy. That is the ENTIRE plot.This movie would probably only be about 1/2 length if you took out the action sequences. Not impressed."
4,Good action spy thriller.,"Fast pace action thriller was entertaining and the plot was solid. I watched the extended blu ray version. Fans of revenge flicks will like it. Some people seem disappointed that it's not more realistic. It's fiction. You want reality, watch documentaries. This was more realistic than most of the Bond movies."
5,Cool action flick!,"This was a really cool, action flick, full of interesting twists & turns. My husband and I both really enjoyed it."
3,Salt/ DVD,"This movie had a lot of action. Miss Jolie is a wonderful actress. I felt the movie was little over the top for me. I will of course see it again, but not as much as I see my other movies."
2,The spy who irritated me,"Angelina Jolie plays a spy with a secret - go figure. The problem is, that she may actually be a sleeper agent from the Soviet Union with designs on bringing down the US of A. The whole 'is she or isn't she' theme wore thin really quick and about two thirds of the way through, I nearly gave up. But I figured I had invested that much time and I needed to see it through. I should have quit, because the end took me from indifferent to angered. There were a few decent action sequences, but there's no way I'd recommend this confused film to anybody.I'm not a hardcore Angelina Jolie fan, but have enjoyed most of the action films that she's headed up. Salt was certainly the exception to the rule. Do yourself a favor and just tape the next Bond marathon on BBC for your spy fix. Salt will just leave you wishing you could recapture those lost two hours."
4,Fast and gritty,"One of the best American action films in quite a while. The action is fast and gritty. The stunts seldom blow past the limits of near-credibility into the realm of CGI cartoon as so many films do these days. The action careens along at such a clip and the plot is just twisty enough that you can't always see what's coming. Man, I wish Jolie weren't too big a name and too expensive to have joined the Avengers ensemble as Black Widow. She would have been spot-on perfect."
2,Too Salty,A bit over the top on human action capability. I felt like I was watching a mix between Spiderman and Matrix. Movie was somewhat entertaining but a little too far fetched. Bourne Identity much much better....believable and realistic.
1,Salt,"At this point questioning whether I make any further purchases on Amazon, because of Moral Hazard!The DVD Salt was sent to me, it was blank, there was nothing on the DVD.Sent numerous email's, I have not received a reply! Nor a Refund! Nor a new movie!So, at this point questioning whether this system actually has any purpose!At the point I will no longer put my information on the site and considering withdrawing all together!"
2,OK movie,It's ok - about a 2-2.5 star. Good for a rental only. Be better to just try and catch it on TV sometime.
2,Are you kidding me,"Just so bad it is difficult to point out exactly what is wrong with this film. Poor story, lame acting, terrible special effects, save you money and watch Jason Bourne again.."
4,Suspenseful,"It was a great movie, and I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. I just wish there was an actual end to the movie. With that said, I will definitely see the sequel."
3,Doesn't live up to its summer hype,"I think you all remember the marketing for this movie this past summer. I thought it was done well and had me interested in seeing the movie. What I finally did see was a letdown. I liked the idea of Angelina Jolie being a spy and liked the first half on the film, but it went downhill (SPOILER) after her husband was killed. Then, not only did Angelina turn into yet another assasin living only to get revenge, half of the cast ended up being secret Russian spies. They could have done better and I was disappointed."
2,So so at best,"The plot if it can be called that, unfolded poorly. For action and suspense, this was heavy on action and almost no suspense (plot). If you like lots of gunfire this may be for you. If you like some type of story to go along with the gunfire, skip this one. Two starts for ""action"" and zero for plot. I really like Angelina Jolie in the Laura Croft movies, she is not very good in this one."
3,Had to return the disc,"Careful.. I have a Vizio VBR 100 with the latest firmware update, and this is the only blu ray disc that will not play on it. It loads to about 80% and then stalls completely. I even talked to Vizio's tech team and they cannot find issue. Sony has some technology on it, and prevents from reading on some players. I've played Star Trek and Avatar special editions with no issues.I saw the movie in the theater and it was great, so I have to at least give Angelina Jolie a few stars. My disappointment is with the technology."
3,Meh,"I was very disappointed. I've no problem suspending belief..it's a movie..belivable isn't an issue. Acting wasn't that great honestly and by the time the movie got started - it was over and I was left with, ""what? that's it?"" Actually I like the premise of the movie but it left me wanting...and wtf happened to Jolie? Doesn't she eat anymore? She looked awful."
2,What kind of ending is that?,After all the excitement full of twists & turns it ends flat. They don't even finish it. It's like there will be a continuation; a part 2. The lack of ending ruined it for me.
1,"Mr. Bourne, you've got a lovely daughter...","Girls as tough as you are something rare... Or perhaps the song should be ""For she's a Jolie good fellow"". Angelina Jolie as Jack Bauer/Jason Bourne, leaping tall buildings with a single bound (almost), beating the stuffing out of numerous assailants, performing near-miracles on command through a particularly ridiculous plot. Ultimately such films are merely flimsy vehicles for the numerous high-energy chase/fight scenes, and as such I find them ultimately unsatisfying (except for the Bourne films - I found that Matt Damon was able to breathe life into Jason Bourne much more than Angelina was with Evelyn Salt).So, it comes down to taste. If you like things where the hero(ine) kicks the living daylights out of a series of baddies at regular intervals and can ignore the flimsy plot that allegedly connects these individual instances of utter mayhem, this is for you. If, however, you like a plot that makes some sort of sense in the real world, it isn't."
2,Not what I expected,This is the second time that I've purchased this movie and it still does not work on my Blu Ray machine. I don't know what's wrong with the movie but it will not play. And it's not my machine.
2,Over rated,I will not get into the specifics of the movie as many others have. I will say that the example given by one reviewer said it all in that it was almost like they didn't know how to make this movie's plot plausable. It reeked of lack of direction and some sense of realism. A Jolie fan might like it just because SHE is in it but take her away and there is almost no rason to watch this movie. There is a reason this movie went to DVD so quickly.
1,Salt ( Angelina Jolie ),Movie was flawed as if it were a bad copy or pirated copy. One scene or chapter in the movie wouldn't play correctly all the way through. Couldn't correct it. Movie purchased thru Amazon.
1,Disappointed and annoyed,"I bought this DVD under the impression that it contains a descriptive video track. If it's there, I can't find it using either my computer or a DVD player. Even more annoying, when I put the DVD in my computer, a window with PC_CLICKME popped up onscreen. Nothing happens when I click on it; pressing alt+F4 won't close it. The only way to get rid of it was to re-start the computer. Of course, the pc_clickme window returned each time I tried to play the DVD."
4,wall to wall action (4.5/5),"my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed Salt from the get go.it's basically wall to wall action.yes there are no doubt plot holes,and logic gaps,but it's all about the action here.and it's so much fun.plus it's so fast paced,you don't really have time to think about logic or plot,unless you really want to.we just went with it and had a blast.and actually the story is generally well written and has some very clever sequences.if you can just turn your brain off for the allotted run time,you should really enjoy yourself.but if you need you movies to have a high degree of logic and realism,this likely isn't your cup of tea.for me, though,i loved it. 4.5/5"
4,Well done!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Angelina Jolie did an excellent job! I loved the action and the suspense! Of course, I'm a huge fan of spy movies and mafia movies! Great premise! Great surprising action scene with how she accesses the President of Russia! Awesome movie!"
1,IT Stinks,"I had this card put in my hp that has windows xp and it stinks. I play everquest and it is blocky ,flickers and now I cannot even play it. I tried down loading new drivers and all that did was make me have to reboot. I totaLLY THINK THIS CARD IS A WASTE OF MONEY."
