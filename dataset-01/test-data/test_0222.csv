5,Toscanini wanted her to be his Lady,"The great maestro could think of only one singer to be his Lady Macbeth and even though he supported Tebaldi here he chose Callas. The former reviewer is a heartless, stupid basher who cannot even name ""Callas' Macbeth"". He writes one-star reviews on all her stuff. Even Callas' enemies were floored by her Lady Macbeth which she sang at La Scala in 1952, a time where her voice could do ANYTHING. And as for Cossotto: Her shrill and tasteless screeching as the lady is boring and not Verdian. Callas SINGS the role. Mascherini is quite fine as Macbeth, not a Leonard Warren but a good voice. Bing wanted Callas to be his Lady Macbeth at the MET! He knows better than some ignorant fool who spends his time bashing Maria Callas and Renee Fleming. The ONLY Lady!"
3,"Best voice ,but poor sound quality","am a big Callas fan,she played Lady Macbeth five times only in 1952 at Scala so no more integral record of the opera.You can find many records of Lady Macbeth's aria anywere but for the rest of the opera i don't think it is possible.She is on the top her voice ,she is here the fat and young Callas she is 29 years old.There is no vocal problem like in the records of the late 50's or 60's.Even the poor quality of the record you can understand why they name her ""La Divina""."
4,nice add'l to ur karcher press.washer,"it's easy to assemble and nice to touch. works fine as describe, especially at high area, since our house in attic side which hard to reach has been easy to clean, and no loss pressure even the barrel get longer. i highly recommend this."
5,Perfect Fit!,"The extension worked beautifully for our two-story home, and the description was very clear re: which models it fit. There was no trouble with mating or fitting. Highly recommended for high, hard to reach places."
1,Did not receive the product - out of stock,Product did not arrive. I contacted vendor and was informed that they were out of stock and had not been informed by the supplier. Refund was processed promptly.
4,More great music!,"I don't know that anything can match my delight of discovery at Sympathique years ago (and yes, I too have given tons of copies of it), but I am again taken with the group's world-spanning songs and styles. I was taking a commuter van to work today with the new album, popped it in, and had three converts by the time the ride was over. It's a great, fun album, a few more introspective songs this time but that's ok. In this time of ""American Idol-ized"" reheated pop pap, Pink Martini is a vibrant, original reminder of good music, well played and sung by people who love it. I can't wait to catch them in concert again, this time with new tunes!"
4,Pink Martini is wonderful!,I've seen them perform live and they are great. Their album is so much fun. They sing in so many different languages and the music is terrific. An absolute must!
3,interfaith polemics,"Winkler uses ibn 'Arabi to attack the modernist, fundamentalist and other such in his opinion wrong interpretations of islamic law, as opposed to the traditional scholars of law, whom he with 'Arabi champions as the good old upholders of an open and flexible view of the Quran and Hadth.Indeed a novel view of ibn 'Arabi, but yet again another defense of ibn 'Arabi with a personal agenda that is neither scholarly, nor entirely correct for that matter."
5,Timeless Mysteries,"Enigmatic and alluring, this is a masterpiece of metal. With epic songs of imagination and emotion, this album has quickly shot up my personal charts, especially in combination with their self-titled first release. Hansi's haunting lyrical style is a perfect fit for the spectacular guitar work of Jon Schaffer. The music as a whole embodies the latest evolution of metal, by far the most superior style of music the human race has created."
2,Boring cd...,"Very dissapointing album for true Iced Earth and Blind Buardian fans!!! Nothing like ""Heaven Denies"" and ""Blood On My Hands"" from their debut album. So the bottom line is, this is not worth buying!"
3,HARMLESS RETREAD,"This direct to video entry in the one-time imaginative series is mildly entertaining, although it is little more than an adult retread of the original. This time Rick Moranis (with a new wife played by Eve Gordon and only one kid this time) shrinks himself, his wife and his brother (Stuart Pankin) and his wife, and they find themselves confronting a giant cockroach as their main enemy, and a cute daddy longlegs helps the mommies out. It's not all that inventive but I found myself chuckling every once in a while. Might entertain the younger set."
5,A great movie!,"I haven't seen this movie in a long time. I enjoyed it when I first saw it and still would now. I really like it because it shows how older children (despite what their parents think) are abel to take care of themselves. Case in point, when Ricky drags Jenny away from the party to steal an unwanted kiss Jenny discourages him and calls off the party. A great and fun movie for the whole family!"
5,"1,000 pages cover basic to advanced shell programming and beyond",Mark G. Sobell and Peter Seebach's A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO UNIX FOR MAC OX S USERS is a reference the UNIX/Mac user simply must have at hand: nearly a thousand pages of reference material on everything from basic and advanced shell programming to Mac's OS X filesystem and utilities modules make this the best reference on the market for users who seek either a step-by-step tutorial or a basic browser's reference for problem-solving. Exercises to test knowledge boxed highlights of information make it easy to either refer to for at-a-glance troubleshooting or sit down and study for step-by-step methodology.
5,An entertaining read!,"I love local history and picked this book up out of the library to do some research for a murder mystery I'm writing. I was not looking forward to reading it as I'm not into technical stuff or battle stuff. From the first page, however, I was fascinated. I found my local history, I found a man who knew a great deal about a lot of stuff and could relate it interestingly, and I found a great man. No wonder the local base was named after him! This is a wonderful book!"
5,It's a great book!,"This book is a masterpiece. If you are into comedy just like me, you need to get you this book right now. It's not gonna transform you in a stand-up comic right away, but trust me, your humoristic skills will increase. I plan to go over it the summer and do all the required exercises..it is amazing how i make my friends laugh now. Get out there and buy it, it's not a waste of money. Take my word for it"
4,"Comedy Writing Secrets, 2nd Ed: The Best-Selling Book on How to Think Funny...","- I had found this book first in my local library. In all spheres of my professional endeavours, this book has been a godsend. I had to get this book from Amazon because, months down the track, the library was wondering what had happened to their copy.- It is not just a hand-/text-book on writing 'funny', it is an instruction manual as deep and as robust as Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", AND it's about the 'funnies', too. Learn and laugh, wince and chuckle, laugh and learn again. A wonderful textbook and a font of relevant, witty, and incisive observations about the 'why's and 'how's of people and their behaviour, and how to use their foibles to your advantage... ""Oh Lord, we beseech thee, never let politicians find this book! (Amen)"".- More effective, and a damn sight funnier than John Edward, Tony Robbins and Germaine Greer rolled into one - like Sun Tzu, but without the dignity."
2,Make Jokes Like Your Dad! Delight No One!,"Actual line from the book: ""Many of the masks of comedy, such as The Vaudevillian, The Old Timer, and The Ventriloquist, have not been performed on a regular basis for years, and no one can explain why.""A QUESTION FOR THE AGES."
1,Put this book back in the time capsule,"This book is an antique. I found this book to be completely dated and unhelpful. Unless your are Schecky Green and going out on tour on the Catskills comedy circuit don't buy this book. If you plan on opening with ""Take my wife, please"", then you will find this book very helpful, if not then don't bother...RKC"
1,"Old jokes abound, too many dirty jokes","Sure, people like dirty jokes or very old, dated jokes, but that's not what I want to learn. Instead, I want to learn how to actually be funny, not just crude or dull. Although I could wade through this book and use the techniques on other subject, I'm choosing to move on to other books on comedy writing written by other authors who actually teach how to write fresh jokes on a wider variety of topics."
5,Comedy Writing Secrets,"This book is extremely informative as well as entertaining.As someone doing a fair share of writing, and appreciating the use of humor in writing, I have found great value within these pages. I recommend it highly.It convinces you that trying to inject humor into your writing, without studying some of the actual structure and types of humor, puts you at a disadvantage. For anyone interested in adding some humor to increase the impact and lessen the boredom in their written work, this book is a must-have for your personal library."
3,ARE WE ALONE?,"I actually am a fan of the show UFO Hunters. I like the fact that they provide you with all the information that they have and then it is left up to you the make the decision if it is true or false. Some of the stars on this show were previously on a show called UFO FILES. Alot of the stories deal with the same UFO encounters that UFO Files has already dealt with. I like the fact that there is a skeptic on this show who tries to debunk everything. I think that some of the evidence this show provides us with is sometimes shocking. All in all I find the show very enjoyable and cannot wait to see a second season. From Rosewell, beneath the sea, black boxes from pilots to Betty and Barney Hill, the UFO hunters unravel the truth and leaves us wondering, ARE WE ALONE?"
3,not bad,visable eaaaasssly. great sound quality. has trouble staying in groove when back spining or scrubing.
3,Uneven,"Uneven collection of short stories, essays, and interviews by/with leading Iranian creative types. The personal stories are the most compelling, while some of the critical essays read like undergraduate assignments. One sometimes gets the feeling that all these people know each other and are presenting a very small picture of the state of current Iranian culture.Recommended for the good bits, but there are much better books out there on this subject (by many of the contributors)."
3,Costa Rica Map,The country is split on this map. One-half of the country is on one side and one-half is on the reverse side. This format is going to be rather inconvenient for use. The plus for this format is that it allows the text on the map to be a good readable size. I will probably try to find a smaller map of Costa Rica that has the entire country printed on one side of the map so it can be conveniently used for quick reference.
1,bad service bad product,"the headphone is bad icant hear the to headphone a onlycan har one, the sevice is bad 11 day to arrive pesimo"
1,FabTech spring,"I ordered the FabTech suspension set up as pictured. I also was surprised that I only got ONE spring. Nothing in the advertisement, (showing a complete front suspension (two spring sets, 8 U bolts, two front shocks, two spring stops plus two rear shocks) and nothing in the wording specifies only getting one spring. But I was able to send it back without too much problem."
4,A way of seeing history,"This effort at telling the history of the twentieth - century by eye-witness accounts of major events is at times illuminating and at times disappointing. There is an undue focus on events in Great Britain. There are omissions, such as that of the Six- Day War in the Middle East. There are moving documents such as the section from Anne Frank's diary.The material on the whole is not intensive enough to provide any major insight into a historical event or process. But as an impressionistic work , a survey work it is generally a good and fair piece of work."
2,Doesn't really work,"In its defense I have yet to find anything that will actually clean grease spills. My jeep leaked some motor oil on a brand new white concrete driveway so I used this. It may have faded the spill a bit after letting it sit and some intense scrubbing, but the spill was very much still visible."
2,Doesn't Remove Oil On Concrete!,"After reading the Amazon reviews, I anxiously awaited my shipment so that I can try removing some fresh oil stains on a brand new concrete driveway. I followed all instructions and tried applying and cleaning several times and the best I got was some lightening of the stains. Needless to say I am disappointed in this product and would not recommend it for 'oil on concrete' applications."
5,Removes Oil Easily,"Works best on fresh oil, but spray, let it sit, rinse. Works great on hands, concrete, etc. Takes a bit more scrubbing with set in oil, though. No toxic fumes."
2,Disappointed,"Some workers left some mystery stains on my concrete driveway, figured they were gas or oil. Tried some Simple Green didn't work so bought this stuff. I've used it 3 or 4 times so far and if it had any effect, it's pretty minor.However, I got some lubricating grease on my hands the other day and tried this for that. It did help in that case. So it's not totally useless, just not the magic potion I hoped for."
3,pretty good,"The music is good, but I guess I'm confused by this collection. Even the ""big"" CD choice of the 2 Winter's nights CD's here don't have everything on the iTunes selection, which is annoying. But, what you hear is great and a nice variety. ""God Rest Ye...."" is probably my favorite track and the reason I bought the album."
1,Too bad Amazon doesn't have negative stars,"I am a math major, and I bought this book, thinking that it would either be a humorous book, or what it claimed...a way to impress people. It was completely worthless. Do not bother with it.I know math is tough, and most people do not understand it at all. This book won't help you at all. It is wrong in places as well, and I mean basic stuff. Use with care!"
5,A Great Book and a Great Reader,"I purchased TITAN when if first came out, but never got around to reading it. When I spyed the title of audio cassette I was at first reluctant to tackle a book with 13 tapes in just the first part. However, it was an excellent decision.The narrator, Edward Holland does an outstanding job. He makes the story come alive.The book reveals a side of Rockefeller that I was totally unaware of. We all know he was a philathropist but did you know that his money cured hook worm disease in the American South and most of Central America? I was totally unaware of his contributions to the University of Chicago and that his giving virtually started research institutes in America.Of course there is a down side to Rockefeller and his trust and Standard Oil, but the amount of giving that Rockefeller gave in his life and through his contributions to the arts, science, medicine and social issue is so fast it can hardly be measured."
1,Stay Away,"Just downright awful. Amateurish, platitudinous, narcissistic blather. Just what Poetry Does NOT NEED! My advice is for Mr. Berman to study Whitman, Cesaire, Artaud, Vallejo,& Hart Crane (to name just a few) to gain some sense about the art's authenticity. Or, stick to strumming.It's clear he has a strong fan club, albeit, one that is very naive (to be kind) regarding the poetic arts."
2,Pop poetry - not that there's anything wrong with that.,"I guess that I am underwhelmed. This is fun, light-hearted stuff. But the accolades that it is given here make no sense to me. It is almost as if slackers have decided that ""real poetry"" is no longer good poetry because it was already there, and this new, laid-back style of poetry fits their ""new generation and we are better than the old generation"" attitude.If you worship Maxx Barry and Chris Moore (and I LIKE their stuff, I just don't think it is the best stuff ever written) then this poetry is probably your stuff.I think it belongs ""on the back of the terlet"" for light reading when you aretakinga squat.Look, I'm a poet too! I was able to put the words in a sentence on different lines and make it look pretentious!"
1,Woefully Inadequate,"""Fodor's Seattle"" lacks important information essential to a memorable Seattle area trip. For example, it does not even mention the Boeing plant tour and nearby aircraft displays, and while it does have information on some day trips (eg. Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Ranier, Olympic National Park), it lacks information on nearby Tacoma's impressive renovated railroad terminal and Chihuly glass displays. I'm left wondering what else is missing."
1,"Hitachi 12"" miter saw","I had to give the saw a poor review because I never got to use it. After ordering the saw, and looking forward to using it, when it arrived, the sub fence was broken, and the saw had to go back. Ok, they were very good about the whole thing, so I can wait for the replacement. The second saw came just three days later. I joked with the UPS driver that she should stick around so she could take it back with her. Guess what, the sub frnce on the second saw was broken! Back it went, but this time I didn't ask for a replacement. The saw looked good, but the thing was shipped with the bevel not fully locked, so it must have slammed into the sub fence during shipping, causing the thing to break."
3,I wouldn't recommend this for finish work.,"This saw has a powerful motor and makes a smooth cut. The laser feature is excellent and provides an easy guide for cutting and is easy to adjust to the left or right. However the left and right fences do not lineup for a square cut on both sides. I have to adjust the fences for a square cut for the side on which I want to make a cut. Also there are no instructions in the owner's manual for how to adjust the fences. I had to figure it out on my own. The bevel guages for the left and right do not agree when the blade is set square. The left bevel guage will read as ""0"" while the right guage will read as -1 1/2 degrees. The saw is heavy at 47 1/2 pounds so is difficult to lift for storage. If you have a space problem and will need to lift it to store it I would recommend the 10"" saw. This saw would be good for basic construction but I now wish I had gotten a 10"" saw for finish work."
5,Amazing,"I bought this book because i wanted to have all of Edgar Allan Poe's stories and poems. From what i know this really is all of them, there is even a few critic reviews he wrote. Most likely the best book of all his writings out there. The binding is strong and the book isn't heavy at all. Was really surprised with how fast shipping was (got to my house a day before it said it would). I would highly suggest this to anyone wanting all his works in one volume."
1,This book is the worst book by Poe I've ever read!,"This book was truely awful! Not only did it leave out some of Poe's best works, the format was confusing and irratating. My pet worm won't even stand it! And he eats dirt."
5,Awesome,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I loved it when I read it and now she too is in love with Edgar Allan Poe.
3,Took FOREVER to ship...,"If you order this from Amazon (as a seller), I hope you are not in a hurry. I had a paper to write on Poe, and it showed up just after I turned in the final draft. This was weeks after I ordered it. I'm sure the book is great, but I don't have time to read it now. I did have time a few weeks ago though... Again, this is only a reflection of the seller of this book, not on the book itself."
4,The Beatles...Enough Said.,"I love The Beatles, no matter what they do. I love this album. I like every song on it, especially Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
2,A sad addition to my previous commentary ...,"Just took a look at the digital waveforms on this compact disc. What a horror! Every track has been viciously compressed; the peaks are clipped to within a few fractions of a decibel of 100%, squashing all of the dynamic range out of the music in an attempt to make it sound as ""loud"" as the latest hits by Ricky Martin and Cher.This is improvement?"
4,Beatles Music----NUFF SAID!!!,"The music of the Beatles will be popular till the end of time. I never really liked the original Yellow Submarine album because of all the filler instrumental tunes. I greatly enjoyed this reissue on CD because it included more songs by the Fab Four. This is one great sounding CD. Everyone involved in it from the musicians to the engineers deserve many kudos. To all those people who say that it is a terrible thing that the surviving Beatles are tampering with their music, hey get over it. On CD it only sounds better and it was already superior music so why not enhance it?"
3,The catalog remastering starts off on the wrong foot.,"As I have been saying this catalog better start getting a major sonic overhaul. I also don't want all the CDs to sound like this Yellow Submarine Songtrack. The Let It Be movie DVD/VHS/CD anniversary is coming. Let's brace ourselves.Can't EMI know how to use the original multitracks (two track, four track, and eight track stereo) to produce a ""fresh"" stereo master? Or do we have to alter the way these songs sound.Sure, they needed to be mixed in surround sound for the movie. However, for the CD, I would have preferred a remastered original mix of the music. These songs have a clarity so glaring, so antiseptic, they sound artificial! The original warmth is gone!Witness the Byrds catalog. Fresh stereo masters were created from the multitracks identical to the originals. If other labels can do it right, why not EMI. If the rest of the catalog is radically altered this way, I may have a rock collection without The Beatles!"
4,"Worth it, sorta...","This CD is the new version of the one constantly struck down as the Mops' worst, known for having only 7 Beatles songs total with only 4 actually new. This re-issue has 15 of their trippiest, remastered and remixed (including the 4 from the original.) Contrary to press releases, the music isn't really all that much trippier, they just sort of cleaned up the songs, and fixed some of the occassions when the mono sound produced an annoying ""one side only"" effect. If this sort of thing appeals to you, by all means buy it. Also, if you don't have the original ""Submarine"" now is the time to hear ""Only a Northern Song"" ""All Together Now"" ""Hey Bulldog"" and ""It's All Too Much."" Other than that, don't waste your time if you already have the original. EVERYBODY needs to buy the amazing ""complete"" video though (I confess, I haven't seen it) enriched by the additions of the removed ""Hey Bulldog"" sequence."
2,"Nice Collection of hits , sadly missing the symphonic works","One attraction of the original yellow submarine soundtrack was the wonderful music of George Martin, the ""fifth Beatle"". The other pop songs originally presented, such as 'Yellow Submarine', were not truly hit material. This CD has some nice songs, some powerful music, but is sadly lacking the original drawing feature of the original. To package it this way is deceptive."
3,Good but overpriced,"The camera is OK -- 640x480 resolution -- but doesn't have a flash, which is critical for indoor use. Also, since it takes up the Compact Flash slot, I had to delete several programs out of main memory to store photos. ...."
5,So cute!!!,"I loved these socks. They were very cute, and fit well. They go a the way up to my knee. Also, the pink on them has sparkle in it which adds to the cuteness. Definitely worth buying!!!"
2,Hard to fly,"I got this for my birthday. It broke while putting together. Got a new one and ok this time. It was fun to watch fly for a couple minutes, then lost control and it went into a tree. It broke when it fell out. I taped it up like the directions said, but when I went to fly again, was fun to chase, but you really do not have any control. It needs a string so you can find it when it fly away."
1,If it was only possible to give no stars . . .,"this book would be a candidate. Waite's book is one of the reasons that psychohistory remains, undeservedly, on the fringes of the academic community. No, I'm not an academic, so please don't think I'm looking down on Waite's effort from that perspective. But even the most cursory reading of the literature about Hitler makes clear that Waite has taken only the most sensational, and almost totally unreliable, information that he could dredge up, and then molded it into an ""analysis"" of Hitler designed to sell books. It is sad to see the selective use of materials to produce a book like this. For those interested in a sober, exceptionally researched book on Hitler, which also happens to be very well written, Ian Kershaw's Hitler biography, ""Hubris"", is the perfect antidote to Waite's extremely flawed book"
2,Undo Speculation and Distortion,I've read this book twice to make sure I had a reasonable impression of it. I am a historian of Hitler since my Junior High days. This review may not help you because I will not belabor the absurdities and distortions contained therein; I only give it two stars because there are some interesting factsabout Hitler buried within the falsehoods that predominate.A good historian will be able to pick these out and laugh at the rest...
2,The dangers are clear......,of engaging in physcoanalysis of people removed in time and place. Wow. I'd like to see Waite's take on other historical figures. Exciting reading if nothing more.
2,Unimpressed,"This software is not very easy to use...rather lengthy book to go with it that didn't really answer the questions I had. In addition, as a homeowner with about 1.5 acres of yard, it seemed like it took way too long to get anything done, felt like I was better off just trying things outside and seeing how I liked it.And the most important, the rebate. I was ripped off. Shame on me for this being one of few times that I didn't bother to make a copy of the items I sent in. They claimed the UPC was not there and that is not true. They then let me sit on hold on a long distance phone call for 10 minutes. Then told me they could not check to see if they had made a mistake. So, if you buy, don't expect to get your rebate easily."
4,A Good Read,Patrica Gaffney is fast becoming one of my favorite authors and offers quite possibly the most complex characters in Romance today.Another Eden is the story of an unhappily married woman and the architect her husband hires to build their summer home. The hero is immediately charming but not particularly admirable at first. The heroine is admirable and long suffering to begin with but later shown to have her own flaws. As their friendship and eventual romance develops these very human failings endear them to the reader. Here is no card-board cut out of a posturing testosterone pumped male and no simpering ninny of a heroine. They are mutli-faceted and the obstacles they face are very real.I particularly enjoyed the period of the book whis is late 1800's or possibly just after the turn of the century. It's an era not often visited in historical romances and it was quite refreshing and very well done.
4,"Great, but not as cool as I remembered","I watched this as a kid and loved it. The special effects aren't as great anymore, but still a great story. I re-read the Jules Verne books that it's based on with my son who was interested in airship. So it was fun to see again. These Verne books are online for free."
5,Amazing Budget Microphone For On-Camera Interviews,"I purchased this microphone for on-camera interviewing purposes. Initially, I was going to buy a $150 microphone because I was nervous about this one picking up background noise (I was filming during a large after-party). I am 100% glad I chose this one and didn't spend the extra $100. It provides a crisp clear sound even when there is total noise all around you. You could barely hear the ambiance of the party and the interviewer and interviewees both came through beautifully. Definitely pick up this microphone if you are going to be interviewing people in a loud/crowded place. It's not too expensive and the Shure sound quality is one-of-a-kind."
3,"Sorry, Charlie.","I wasn't real impressed with this Mic. Granted, i didn't pay a whole heaping for it, but still. I gave it three stars because it hasn't failed me yet and it's made very well. The biggest drawback was the sound quality. I have a cheaper offbrand mic and it sounds just as good."
3,PG 58,"A good microphone for indoor music studios.I used this for the independant films for a few months and it DID NOT WORK RIGHT!It is all in 1 channel mono which is annoying as hell!It would often turn on and off automaticaly unless on a boom, the cords don't stay in correctly at ALL!It has really pissed off many of us in the productions.I would only perfer this microphone to musicians.$50 is a bad price when you can buy a condeser microphone for $40 that works 10 times better!"
5,Very good product!,You need to purchase another adapter to connect it to your karaoke system. I only noticed it after I got the product and had to ordered it seperatly. But the experience of using it is absolutely wonderful. Better than all the other ones I got so far
1,Boring and Unrealistic,"I bough this book, because I was boarded, and it was on the bargain table in the bookstore for $3.00. Now I know why the book was only $3.00. The plot and the character in this book seem very unrealistic. I guess it is suppose to be about every girl&#65533;s dream but it just too much. Not only are parts of the plots hard to believe but sometimes simple actions would never happen, for example at the end of the story Dancer lifts Mousie, the main character, onto his back and they jump over the 5 foot fence from a stand still, and Mousie being such a great rider isn&#65533;t worried that she is on a galloping horse, bareback, in a nice dress, with nothing resembling a bridle, improper footwear, and no hardhat. The characters were not developed, and became really annoying by the end of the story. The structure, and the development of story were just awful. The book felt like it was written by a 12 year old, not a grown woman who claims to know about horses."
4,Scarecrow for Halloween,"I bought this for my son who is 10 for Halloween. It is very cute, and it goes with the wizard of oz theme for my kids costumes this year which is great, you have to buy the straw and the face paint but other than that its cute a little bit big on my son who is really skinny but cute."
3,Susan gone bad!,"An entertaining enough outing for Spenser and Hawk, with the added bonus of Susan showing some flaws. She even seems to eat a whole meal at one point! The villian is extra-evil this time, and his wife is fat--therefore super-evil. One major flaw is a preposterous plot twist that has Spenser and Hawk hired by the all-knowing villian: what, he's too busy corrupting the planet to check references? Of course Susan goes back to perfection by the end, but a reader can hope that her penchant for Oedipal married men will crop up again in the future..."
2,Not up to par,"I've read about fifteen Spenser novels, enjoyed the series thoroughly, and this is the first one I've found disappointing. The story line is more unbelievable than the rest of the series, and Spenser is out of character when he murders a pimp just to get some working capital and hires on as an assassin to get out of trouble with the feds. Worst of all is the endlessly repetitive descriptions of his angst over Susan's affair (and a lot of similar angst from Susan), which read like something Woody Allen would have churned out. Other reviewers have praised this as showing his sensitive side, but to me it was mostly tiresome psychobabble. On the plus side, his smart mouth is still present, and the jailbreak sequence was right up to snuff. If you're reading the Spenser novels in chronological order you need this as a bridge to later (and better) ones, but otherwise it's expendable."
1,"Catskill Eagle - AUDIO VERSION read by, Michael Prichard","I read the hard cover version of this book and loved it so much. The best ever of all in the Spenser series in my opinion. I bought the audio version (read by, Michael Prichard),thinking it would be great fun to listen to it. I was very disappointed. The book was read, but with no character, (no emotion). I would love to listen to this one again, if read by Joe Mantegna"
2,cut into hose,Seems like it would have worked great if not for it cutting into my radiator hose. Not sure if it was damaged during shipping or not.
3,Buen producto si tu ingles es basico,"El curso esta bien presentado y las lecciones estan en diferentes pistas para poder escoger exactamente el topico que quieres escuchar. Sin embargo el nivel es bastante basico, como para una persona que nunca ha vivido en EEUU y esta buscando su primer trabajo aqui. Puede ser un buen repaso, pero no esperes una preparacion intensiva para una entrevista profesional."
1,Not for everyone,This may be a great cream for other skin types but it didn't work for my mother. She is 64 and has olive color combination skin. She used it only twice and it made her skin red and dry. Her forehead (which is normally oily) started to peel. Her face was itchy so she had to stop using it.
1,"Wow, bad to worst","This plot is so unbelievable and implausible that there was no enjoyment in reading it. Sure, as with every suspense novel you want to know what is going on and why, but this ""work"" just had me yelling into the night air ""It doesn't make sense! It doesn't add up!""Add to that all the creepiness (Spoiler alert that didn't make sense either: An intersexed person cannot impregnate themselves by masturbating into a turkey baster with their male member and then injecting themselves in their female member)"
5,Facinating!!!,"A twisted, bazaar tale that captivates you from the beginning through the end! Masterful characters! Loved It!"
3,"Not too bad, but kind of slow...","This book had a lot of likable and interesting characters in it. It has a plot that is a good hook, and make you actually want to know how it turns out. Unfortunately, as with most Koontz books I've read, it's marred by the fact that the writer has problems relating characters that talk and act like normal people. Too much information about minor characters, and main characters that seem to be well thought out, but not executed well by the author. It's worth the price of the paperback though, if just for a nice light read."
2,On the edge of my seat,This is a bizarre thriller. It kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through. I couldn't put it down.
4,Scale,"Unfortunately the product leaves a white residue or scale. Depending on your application, this could be a very good product or just another caustic base degreaser.Oil Eater AOD1G35437 Cleaner Degreaser 1 gallonr"
5,Excellent cleaner,Have used Oil Eater in our restaurant for all types of cleaning and it not only works great on grease but all types of food and cooking stains. Will even work on windows !
4,A completely charming little movie,"This is a movie about the crew who mans a gigantic dish antennea out in the boonies in Australia. They have been recruited to provide help in receiving transmissions from Apollo 11 as it attempts to land on the moon. The landing is the focal point of the story, but what is really going on here is the charming story of the local people manning the dish, plus one American from NASA, as they get ready for the big event.It is truly one of those small little movies that you get lucky sometimes and hit on television at the beginning at like two in the morning not expecting it to be anything...and then you find out, to your delight, that it is something...warm, moving, funny and human."
3,Hand-loom weaving,"wish there were some pictures or diagrams, haven't read the whole book, lots of tips and tricks, but again, wish there were some pictures"
5,Nice book!,"This book focuses on creating four styles of bags: the tote, clutch, drawstring, and beach bag - plus variations on these four styles.The book comes complete with step-by-step illustrated instructions for each type of handbag, which so far, have been pretty clear and easy to follow. Also included are all the necessary patterns, but will have to be enlarged with a copy machine to be of any use.At the back of the book there is a full-color ""gallery"" of various students' handbag designs. I found this to be useful as well as interesting.However, after making some of the bags I was a little disappointed with the results. I'm finding I have to make modifications to the designs to produce something I actually like. But overall, the book is worth purchasing if you are interested in making your own handbags. It will inspire you, at the very least!"
2,beware the ouija board,"This is about a group of friends who unlock a door and let out a demon called Djinn, which starts a killing spree, picking off allof them one by one. In the cast are Alec Newman (Tv's Angel, Children Of Dune) and Lukas Haas (Mars Attacks, Boys). It's a bit of this and its a bit of that. The killings are predictable and the girls are so annoying with the screaming. Didnt we get enough of those Djinn a-holes from The Wishmaster movies? A good time for a little bit then it turns into a dry ride. The end is great though. The special effects for the Djinn face as a little bit laughable."
1,"""You be careful out there among them English.""","A hugely promising concept marred by a wandering screenplay, silly editing, and a relentless string of tediously un-scary sequences in which teens are stalked by a boring demon. This is yet another lost opportunity to do something new and original with the horror genre - especially disappointing as it's an English film and therefore might be expected to deliver something beyond the Hollywood formula. As it turns out, ""Long Time Dead"" is only truly notable for confirming that, at age 24, Lukas Haas still looks precisely as he did in ""Witness""."
3,Luigi Miller Place NY,"I think this book was good book because it firsts takes place in 1997 when Higgens and his wife survive a plane crash in the English channel, then it jumps in to world war2 and Higgens is a ww2 polit.and lots of thing happen to him. I recomend Flight Of Eagles to anyone looking for a world war2 action book and this book also many twists and turns to keep you reading to the end"
5,Lots of old Jack Higgins characters at their best,"Fast paced,full of old Jack Higgins characters from previous books with a few great new ones. Exciting story, excellent tie in with past and present. I was sorry it ended, I wanted more."
3,My First Exposure to Jack Higgins' writing,"While by no means spectacular, this book had an interesting--yet cliche--plot. The twin brothers, son of an American WWI fighter pilot and German nurse, both are trained in their youth to become great dogfighters. After their American father's death their mother returns to her German estate with one of the sons. The plot develops as the two sons encounter each other on opposite sides in WWII. The audio tapes were ok to listen to, my complaint being that the sole reader tried to modulate his voice for different characters, but was noticably inconsistent, making it difficult on occasion to know who was talking."
5,"Excellent, up to his usual standards!",Higgins knowledge of WWII never ceases to amaze me. Be prepared to read this one cover to cover.
1,Higgins magic formula is missing.,"The concept of conflict within a family during the war makes for exciting reading. Len Deighton accomplished this with ""Winter"", the story of two brothers caught in the conflict of war. Higgins got carried away in his book with these two fighter aces, the same tactics where repeated over and over. Seems as the Higgins touch is missing and instead imitation of other authors is there especially the back cover looks a bit like Clive Cussler."
4,Bob Soriano TED 451,I enjoyed this book as a tool for children in the primary grades especially. The content and illustrations are not thorough enough for older children but are perfect for students in the K-3 ages. The length of the book was appropriate but it seemed to sometimes drag on for a while. I especially liked the timeline at the end of the story which is typical in this specific series of books. The depiction of Abe Lincoln was just right for the intended audience and it allowed the readers to understand why he is such a hero in this country.
4,ChristinaTED451-Simple Book for Primary Grades,"I found this book to be very short and to the point. The illustrations are ok, some reviewers thought the depiction of Abraham was not realistic. I think the total summary of illustrations of the man are appropriate enough for primary graders that aren't going to know the difference anyway. Hopefully, if this book is used in the classroom, it will be supplemented by URL sites or pictures of the real Abraham Lincoln and places associated with him during his life. I agree with one reviewer in that this book might bring up topics too mature for children under 8 with pictures of a slavery auction and assasination. If you know what your answers will be to awkward questions that might come up from your students about these topics, I think this is a fine book to use to at least introduce them to this famous American President."
4,Good weatherproofing plastic at a good price!,"I purchased this plastic to add an layer of insulation to some exposed windows in a summer lake property. It is a heavy plastic, although light enough to adhere to large windows with some two-sided poster tape and a few standard staples. It's better described as opaque, rather than clear. Once on a window, you'll get some light from the outside, but no scenery.The only problem I encountered during use is that first yards on the roll were not cut straight. The edges were almost scalloped in a few places, and I cut some sheets only to find out that this imperfection made the sheet to small to use in spots. Hence, the four star review, although once into the roll, this problem did correct itself."
1,You gotta be kiddin me,"Given the fact that this is the only edition available with all the short stories I wanted, took a chance! No TOC to jump to the beginning of each story, just a lump of words, then the first story starts suddenly.Amazon should be ashamed to charge money for this. not even an icon, just the ugly ""no image available"""
5,"Is there a ""Voice of the Century""???","If there is, the title goes to the Prima Donna del Mondo, Maria Callas. I never understood the bashers saying her voice wasn't beautiful. It's like always eating vanilla icecream and because that tastes good, one never gives other flavors a chance. And Callas had all those flavours in her voice. Innocent light colours, jealousy, love, hatred, madness, fear, anguish... It's all there. She's not a singing machine but a human being. Art is human, not mechanic science. Why isn't she forgotten her last performance being about 40 years ago? I'll tell you why with a quote: ""She, more than others, gave opera its truest meaning!"" Having a nice voice isn't enough, how many pretty voices have come and gone? This compilation is a timeless masterpiece and belongs in every Opera-Collection!"
3,ok,"split in the middle with this one great to see everyone again and you know what?, they are about to make a 3rd one didn't see that one coming"
2,"Skip this, not worth the time","Interesting start with Benedict coming after the Oceans and Oceans trying to come up with a method to get the money quick. From that point, it's not interesting. Just long and you feel it's building up to something but it never does like the original.DVD ""special features"" has 1 trailer."
3,Do You BELIEVE How Cool We Are?,"On the level of plot, the movie is mostly blurred. On the level of style, the film is way too slick to ever create any kind of real dramatic reality or momentum. This movie might have worked If it had put more effort into clarifying its complex plot, and if Clooney and Pitt had not both disappeared into a cloud of their own coolness. They are both so laid back & cool & suave that they become like Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat--all grin and no substance. It's a movie about tempo, style & cool; it's not a movie with a story that arouses interest."
2,"Rent, don't buy","Rent, don't buy this one. By the end of the movie, I was simply waiting for it to hurry up & get over with. Basically, it's just an ok movie sequel relying on an all star cast.The obligatory sequel enabling ending is included, in case you were wondering."
2,An even dozen isn't better,"Ocean's 12 lacks the fun of its predecessor, Ocean's 11, mostly because there really AREN'T 12 master thieves running amok....most of the cast spends their time sitting in a cell, an extremely poor decision on the director's part. Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for half the movie!The story theme is great: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around."
3,Good Follow-Thru,I like the sequel to Ocean's Eleven. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical. Most sequel to movies crash and burn. My favorite was Matt Damon who played a more dominant role this time around. The scene with Julia Roberts playing herself was hilarious. But overall I gave this movie three-half stars for the following reasons: The ending of the movie was awkward and silly. Soderbergh could make a better ending. Also the movie which borrowed from the movie Entrapment which Catherine Zeta-Jones herself star in which was overplayed. All in All good movie.
1,"A movie made for a paycheck - weak, dumb and silly","When a screen full of big names - many of them good actors - make a sequel this bad, they have to be doing it for the paycheck. I suspect that if any of them had read the scipt, he or she would have hurt themselves laughing.The plot - steal 97 million bucks so that the guy you stole other millions from won't kill you. DUH! Real bad guys shoot people who rob them, don't they?The sub plot - the world's greatest thief thwarts them because his reputation as the world's greatest thief is damaged. Geez, what were they thinking?Spare yourself - watch it on TV and donate the money you would have spent on the DVD to a good charity."
5,"Worth it just for ""the laser dance"" scene alone. WOW.","No long review here. All you need to know is it's a movie as good as Ocean's Eleven. More style, more coolness and better locations. The French Thief is the coolest person in the movie, in my opinion. The ""laser dance"" scene is fantastic! I could watch it over and over, and I do. Buy this movie.Alex Loughran"
2,Lacks the creative coolness of the original.,"Remember during the first ""Matrix"" when you were thinking how amazing and creative the whole idea was, and how the Wachowski brothers were geniouses? Then years later wondering why they ruined themselves by killing the coolness of the original with subpar sequels that failed to bemuse anyone but tricked you into giving up your $10.00? That's exactly how I felt when I entered ""Ocean's 12"" which despite it's awesome soundtrack (which earns it two stars) the film cannot escape it's feeling of: ""LOOK AT US ALL, WE'RE ALL BEAUTIFULLY RICH MOVIE STARS AND WE LOVE IT AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE WE'RE ALL HAVING SO MUCH FUN BEING BEAUTIFUL AND RICH!!!"" I honestly forgot the plot several times throughout the movie just hoping that one of the ""stars"" would wipe the smug little smirk of their faces...and Zeta-Jones, the queen of smug smirk...don't get me started."
1,1 Star was as low as I could go.....,"I loved Ocean's 11 and looked forward to Ocean's 12. I had such a hard time staying awake!! All I can say was HORRIBLE!!! I'm just going to try to forget it was ever made. And when it comes out on cable... break out the tarps & rollers, cause I'd rather watch paint dry, it has more texture and depth."
1,This movie was cra*p,"Need I say more. The only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because I had to. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie and go watch ""Ocean's 11"" instead. They should have never made a sequel.Ocean's 11 was such a great movie and did not deserve to be insulted like this. All of you giving this movie more than 1 star need to quit doing drugs!."
1,Pile of crap,"This movie was about the suckiest excuse for entertainment that I've ever wasted 90 minutes of my life on. Proof that the average movie is absolute crap. I disliked Julia Roberts before this steamer, but now I loathe her very existance. This should have ended Clooney's career."
3,Not Eleven but Worth a Watch.,"I think they tried for something a little different in the sequel. Seemed confusing at first but a second viewing proved to be beneficial. Interaction between characters (all) was very well written, although the plot seemed to suffer throughout. It is definitely not an 11 but it has its moments and is a totally different movie. I think if you enjoyed the characters in the first, you will enjoy this one, although most of the characters do not all have a central role as before. But the movie still proved to be a lot of fun to watch."
1,Taking a Masterpiece (11) and making a Dud (12),"Oceans 11 was so good in so many ways that making a sequel must have seemed like a great idea. The problem here, with 12, is that it suffers from character development drift: characters in 11 that were amusing and interesting, then develop themselves in 12 until they are smarmy, cutesy, boring, and worse. Matt Damon's character becomes even more milquetoast like. Clooney's character becomes even stupider in love with Roberts' character, who becomes even more entitled. It's really maddening. Finally the viewer throws in the towel, as what some body may have called the ""plot"" goes on and on and on and on. I threw in my towel about the time that Julie Roberts impersonated a famous movie star, Julia Roberts, who looked so much like Julia Roberts that her good friend, Bruce Willis, was unable to tell that she was an imposter. Right."
2,Snoozefest,"While Ocean's Eleven was fast-paced and funny with an interesting plot, this film plodded along under an unlikely story-line. No way I would recommend this movie to anyone."
2,One small performance,"I just bought this for the performance of Vincent Cassel, my imaginary celebrity boyfriend, after seeing him in Brotherhood of the Wolf. This movie was an awful letdown after the charm and breeziness of the first. What happened here? Who cared? Was there even a plot? I guess that's how you know you're a celebrity: when you film your get togethers with a friend, they call it a movie and people charge admission. The cast looks like they had a great time, but that was it."
4,"""Who died and made you Danny?""","Ok...Ocean's 12 was not like the first one and it's not a ""serious"" thriller...but you kinda knew that going in. This is a fun movie and I like the style of Steven Soderberg's filming used in this movie. My only thing about the DVD is that it doesn't have the director's and the actors commentary. I like hearing the ""story"" behind the scene or the making of any film."
2,WHAT!?,In this movie we find all the original characters and actors back along with a few extra characters we haven't seen before. THis movie is plain and drawn out. IT is pretty much the original but in a different country. A decent sequel never-the-less.
1,huge disappointment,"This movie is a huge disappointment. Terrible character acting, jerky storyline, rediculous ending. Go watch Entrapment if you want a decent musium heist, and not lousy aerobics as this one. Ocean's Eleven was a keeper, this is just trash. And, boy, what other empty character role Bruce Willis is eager to fill?"
2,It's no Eleven!!,"I was so excited to see this movie. Ocean's 11 was so fun and entertaining, but in 12 they were having so much fun making the movie that they forgot they were making a movie. The plot stinks and when they finally reveal to you how they did it, you feel like you were the one robbed. This movie would have been soo much better had they stuck to the original formula and not tried making a glorified home movie."
3,Movie stunk,I rented this movie and didnt like it at all. An all star cast still couldn't do anything for this movie. At least the ending was good. That's the only part that was.
2,Lumbering Sequel,"For starters, this film assumes that you've seen the previous one. That's not the end of the arrogance of this production. The principle actors appear to be on extended holiday and having a good time regardless as to whether we the audience members are in on the fun. All of director Steven Soderbergh's clever photography and editing tricks cannot compensate for what an empty enterprise this affair is. This film's sole redeeming qualities are an extended appearance by Julia Roberts, Cherry Jones playing Matt Damon's mom, and Bruce Willis in an amusing unbilled cameo as himself. A sad waste of time and talent."
1,Sequels always disappoint,Confusing. Disjointed. There's a limit to what good actors can do to rescue a poorly-written script. Save your money and pass this one up.
2,A weak derivative of the Flashman books,These were generally disappointing. I had hoped for a fun American knockoff of Flashman but they were not up to par. Id recommend against them overall if your goal is anything like a Flashman-level derivative.
1,Opined This Reviewer- Dreadfully Annoying,"I made the mistake of buying all three of these books at once, based on their often being mentioned as the ""American Flashmans"". Well, they certainly shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath. The author has an extremely annoying habit of trying to use a different phrase for ""he said"" every time he records a conversation. He breathed, he whispered, he raged, he mumbled, he moaned, he shouted, he queried, he twittered, he giggled, he asked, he wondered, he stated, etc. ad nauseum. Once you notice (which didn't take long) his text becomes unreadable. Literally- I read twenty pages of the first, and the other two have never been opened."
4,pretty earrings,"I think these earrings are pretty. As others have mentioned the stones are not red but more of a pink in color. But, that is fine with me.Added 12/27/2011: Just wanted to pop in to add that after almost a year-and-a-half these are still one of my favorite pairs of earings."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased these for my granddaughter's 9th birthday on July 29th. I opened the package and I thought this is exactly what I wanted. Closed them up and put them away. BUT when I opened them up to wrap them for the party they were all tarnished. Now, it's too late for me to return them. I'M NOT HAPPY!!!!!"
3,Leverback earrings,These earrings are very pretty but the flower is small and the plating did not hold up very long. It is now black on the back connection and difficult to clean.
1,disappointing,"When I saw the discription (RUBY), I assumed red...and the stones are actually PINK. Don't need or want pink earrings...need dark red. Also, very tiny, not worth the cost."
4,Pink not ruby red,"A little disappointed, the stone is not as bright and dark as it appears on the website. The pair that I received has more of a pink colour than a ruby red. Considering the price, I guess it's worth it. Overall, it has a pretty design. I gave it to my niece as a birthday gift."
3,All BUYERS READ BEFORE PURCHASING,"If you intend to use this book in school, buy it NEW. The License key that gives you access to the website for the class assigned tests is not transferrable or renewable. You cannot buy the license separately. I know, I bought this used for class and had to buy a new one even after calling Prentice Hall. They told me that they sell keys separately on some of their books, but not all of them. Also, if you still are buying it used, make sure it contains the 3 CDs that you will need.Overall, it's a very very basic book for someone who has little Microsoft exposure or is not computer literate. The office examples are thorough, but give only the basics. I'd give this book to my grandfather who doesn't like computers, or to a friend who is a Mac user."
1,Not good.,"It's a first edition, and it shows. Full of errors, typos. Good first attempt, but not ready for prime time."
4,FINALLY,"I finally have it in hand. Foundit a little drier than the previous ""Caesars Women"" and wish that we could have stayed with those fierce Gauls longer.All in all not her best one, but a welcome one and I can't wait until the next one. Pompeys fall and Cleopatra, what more could you want for our fave Roman Dictator."
2,Not as good as earlier books in the series.,"The first four books in McCullough's series of novels about first century BC Rome were highly enjoyable, but this one disappoints. There is too much summarizing and too little characterization. As someone familiar with the history of the period, I became bored at times by all the background information that was simply narrated rather than being worked into the plot of the novel. The quality of the writing was also inferior to that found in some of Ms. McCullough's earlier books."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,"Bought this thinking that I would learn something about this author. Turns out it is a 1173 word 1 1/2 page document, Half of which is the books she has written and the BRIEFEST sketch of her life for $9.95! I have purchased full length books for less money. Total rip off."
2,not that i didn't enjoy it...,"i have to say that the particular, edited-out moment in ""rhode to road island"" that is present in this edition is quite possibly the hardest i've ever laughed, back when i used to watch family guy on a dorm computer screen. purchasing the first and second seasons on dvd, i was admittedly disappointed, both by the deprivation of a hilarious moment, and by the blatant censorship. is it worth the whole new dvd, though? i freakin' don't think so."
2,Only for die-hards,"I'm a big fan of the show, and bought this despite having both DVD sets on the shelf. Primarily, I was interested in the ""Rhode to Rhode Island"" commentary by Brian and Stewie. It's a great concept, but falls flat in execution.The novelty of hearing Brian and Stewie use profanity wore out in about three seconds. What's left is just not that funny. There obviously wasn't that much effort put into this track, and that's a shame. Call this a missed opportunity.The remainder of the extras are marginally interesting, but unless you're a die-hard, must-have-everything kind of fan, you can pass on this without fear of missing something great.Instead, take that money and buy ""Greg the Bunny"" on DVD. Fox may have come to its senses by brining back ""Family Guy"", but they lost a gem when they killed off GtB."
4,Worth it for Road to Rhode Island,"Everyone who complains about this DVD being a ripoff need to keep in mind that they are releasing the UNCUT version of Road to Rhode Island, something that disappointed me terribly when the Full Season was released with a censored version. When the original episode aired on TV there was a section making fun of Osama bin Laden and airport security (well prior to 9/11) The DVD set was a travesty in cutting this whole section out. Those who are complaining are just these Johnny Come Lately fans that only bothered to watch it on TBS and DVD and have no idea how great some of the originals were before they were censored for DVD. 13 bucks to regain that episode? Worth it for me."
3,Purchase this?.............mmmmmmmmm.,"I am a DIE-HARD fan of ""Family Guy"", this is my favorite T.V. show and I own ""Family Guy, Vol. 1 & 2"". ""Family Guy"", but...is this item worth $15.00? I think the answer is: ""no"". I don't think this is worth it. This DVD contains all episodes of ""Family Guy"" that are included on Volumes 1 and 2, except the uncensored version of ""Road to Rhode Island"", I love this episode and to be honest: I haven't watched the ""uncensored"" one. So I would recomend instead of this DVD: ""Family Guy, Vol. 1 and 2"" so you will be able to live a whole ""Family Guy"" experience. Trust me.FAMILY GUY RULES!!!!!!!!"
3,"Atmospheric, but slow.","If you're interested in either Welsh folklore or politics, you might want to read this book. As a story, though, it failed to really grab me. Though the characters are very likable and Rickman gives us a good ""feel"" for the setting, the plot meandered far too much. Cut out the by-election subplot (which didn't seem to have any relevance in the end anyway) and the book would have been half as long. After building up the mystery of Y Groes with hints here and there, we never really learn anything. Kind of disappointing."
2,"CREEPY IN SPOTS, SHORTFALL OVERALL","This was an average book and if I had it to do over again, I probably would skip it. The basic storyline really had potential which it never seemed to meet. I was very excited about reading this book, set in Wales, but was disappointed throughout. The ""chill"" factor was low; although the kids and the Welsh schoolteacher were pretty creepy. Curfew was better. Candlenight almost seemed like it was written for Hollywood (B movie)"
1,awful waste of time,It was a jumbled mess that starts with a promise for good supernatural action and falls on its face. Terrible. Save your time and money.
4,Great stuff!,This product works fast. It's easy to put on and dries really fast. I was noticably tan with just one application. I am asian so I naturally have a golden color so I did not look too orange (I don't know about fair skin). I feel like the mousse dries out your skin though as opposed to the lotion.
3,Good Seller,"The book is good for any person looking in to start from 0 presentation skills, if you are looking to enhance your current skills, keep looking. other than that is a great product and the seller was professional (efficient and trustworthy)"
4,a real affordable gift,"Made a good gift for a child I don't know that well, and gives her a start on developing good reading habits as well as a lesson on being a good helper."
5,very good teachings,"A good book for portrait drawing,very practical,very accurate,I have found in this book many things that I did not find in other books.It is worth to spent time and money for it,thanks a lot to the author"
5,TRACKS ARE...,"1. If I Knew You Were Coming, I'd Have Baked A Cake 2. Li'l Liza Jane 3. The Cat Came Back (Again) 4. Piggyback Ride 5. The Bump 6. Poco 7. Ka-Lim-Ba 8. Never Smile At A Crocodile 9. Roller Skating 10. Joshua 11. The Rattlin' Bog 12. Julie Gerond And The Polka Dot Pony"
2,Eh.,"I bought this book back when it first came out, hoping for a well written dissection of the nineties music scene. What I got was a by-the-numbers retelling of the same ""How alternative music came to be"" speech we've all heard before. Zzzzz...The cover is the best part of the book. Trust me."
4,Impressive,Nice sounding recording. The tracks are authentic and is great for anyone interested in medieval history and it's music.
3,Better hinges please!,[...]This is a fun game and the kids are really enjoying it. The cups have a nice solid weight.
2,Poor Quality,poor quality.... the paper labels on the dice cups were falling off when I unpacked it. Also there are only 2 larger cups....the 2 smaller cups are really to small to be useful in hiding the dice.
2,A memoir of Ruth Kligman,It seemed to me that the book was more about Ruth Kligman than Pollock. The majority of the book was devoted to trying to convince the reader how important she was/is to the Pollock legend. I finished the book still knowing less than I wanted to know about Pollock and way more than I wanted to know about Kligman. It is my fault however; the title should have been my clue.
2,False advertising. Otherwise good product.,"This sale is NOT for a ""2-pack"", ""$4.22 / Item"". It is for a single 60-capsule bottle only.Twinlab and Amazon both refused responsibility when I contacted them. After a lengthy process, Amazon refunded me half of the balance. Communication was awful, no apology, and as of writing this review (two weeks later), the listing STILL has not been corrected.I've been a long-time fan of TwinLab's products, as well as Amazon's customer service. It was quite disappointing how I was given the run-around by both parties and made to feel like I was inconveniencing THEM. Although the product is of good quality (e.g. D-alpha-tocopherol for Vit.E), the communication and whole experience with both Amazon and TwinLab left such a sour taste in my mouth, I can't give more than 2 stars until this listing is ""fixed""."
2,A Classic.....snoozefest,"Why is it the so called ""classic movies"" or soon to be are always the most boring? The cover looks amazing and I thought it would be a nice movie, but no action, no comedy, no horror, no suspence.....whats left? Well Drama ofcourse and its not like ""Bad Girls Club"" drama, just a plot to tie the whole thing together, but I don't like it and am glad I found it online instead of paying for it which I almost did. Perfect example of not judging a book (or movie in this case) by its cover."
3,Useful practice kit but Iack of a CAT's version of the test.,The NTC's Practice Tests for the TOEFL is a must-to-have companion for the NTC's Preparation Kit. I bought this kit because I did need more practice material for the TOEFL. The practice exercises are very similar to theirs in the Preparation Kit but are useful in order to get expertise for the TOEFL. The most valuable thing in the Practice Kit are the casettes because for the TOEFL is necessary to listen a lot. The problem that I founded is that the exercises was easier that in the real TOEFL test. As a recomendation to the NTC people I'm strongly suggest to incorporate a CD-ROM with CAT versions of the test this will give a more realistic aproximation to the real test.
1,Not worth the money,I ordered this in hopes of it locking in moisture and after reading tons of good reviews I thought I finally found something that would actually work but to my disappointment it does not. It did absolutely nothing for my skin it actually feels like it dries it out more with the Murad than with just moisturizer. Also under make up it tends to look cakey.
5,Annie Lennox at Her Best,A great display of how powerful Annie Lennox is live on stage. This DVD provides a great mix of her talent & music recorded over the past many years with & without the Eurythmics. Hope she will do more in the future.
3,A song high above the tree.,"This is the third volume in theMaybe This Christmasseries. It features mostly alt-rock performers doing Christmas music. Most of the performances are decent, but not really anything special. But Lisa Loeb does do one of the better versions of ""Jingle Bells"" that I've heard."
1,DEPRESSING!,"I like kind of mellow, sentimental holiday music. But this was just plain depressing. I can understand now why it's no longer available."
4,Good,I made only one thing with it so far. It was apple pie filling. My husband and I both liked the finished product.
5,Couldn't find in stores for Canning Pie Filling,"It was impossible to find this product in Santa Maria, CA stores. I needed it in a hurry so ordered from this online supplier. The product was shipped more quickly and arrived before promised...I was a very happy camper. The product itself was beautiful! White! packaged nicely! looked wonderful! Worked great! Now I have to buy more in larger quantities...would buy from here if they had the larger size at a comparable price with competitors.Made some terrific canned apple pie filling...lots of excited compliments on how good it is! Thanks!"
1,This guy is a fake!,"Just saw him in Reno, NV. The music was canned, his performance was a real sham. The dancers were the only enjoyable part of his live performance. He just tossed his hair around and played air guitar."
5,A great mucis dvd of Roni Benise,"I'm happy with my purchase and with the music an concert of Roni Benise ""NIghts of Fire"", since he plays beautiful spanish guitar and flamenco music.Also I loved the availability of products in Amazon, and also the security and shippment of the purchase."
4,ONLY baby e-book I've found!,"I'm not a big fan of letting baby have my phone or iPad or whatever, but sometimes when your out and about or are using the device, baby wants to see what's going on.Right now, my 9 month old LOVES faces and LOVES books, so I was looking for any kind of picture e-book I could find that were appropriate for his age so I could always have the book with me.This was literally the ONLY book I found. E-books for children under two are practically non-existent. I 100% appreciate why this isn't a booming field, from a development perspective babies aren't supposed to have screen-time before two, so why would publishers bother?Well they should.Some parents like me actually want to use the device WITH my baby and not as a electronic nanny.I hope that more kinds of these books become available sooner rather than later."
2,Not Good...,"Another poster mentioned that this rack resembles the ""Leaning Tower of Pisa"" when full... and they are dead-on accurate. I tried to load up 80 CDs, but the stand was leaning so much it could tip over any second. To say the design leaves a lot to be desired is an understatement! Even half-full (as I have things now) the stand tilts dangerously forward. I have a cat and I would wager the stand will not last out the week before it tips over with all the discs on the floor. On the up-side, the stand *was* easy to assemble (taking only 1 minute). Definitely the negatives outweigh the positives on this one, and as such I don't recommend anyone buy this."
3,"Holds a lot, and recommended except for one thing","This is a heavy-duty product that has no trouble holding the advertised number of CDs. I have a fairly large collection of CDs, and I have filled up one 80-disk tower, so I ordered another one. This one works well and holds the CD securely.My only complaint is that one cannot push the tower back against the wall, and have the titles face directly outward. If you push the tower back against the wall, as I do, means the titles now face in an awkward angle.I suppose one cannot expect perfection, but I do wish the product could be redesigned so it could be right against the wall, and still display the titles straight out."
4,Swinging funky big beats,"Second time around the block for midland (Birmingham?) boys Mike Stokes and Richard March, delivering the same loopy off the wall sound as their first effort. There's not much in the way of singles material here but that doesn't really matter because the entire album is greater than the sum of its parts - a real joy to listen to a group with an original sound in a genre full of copycats."
4,Great Photos,"This book has some of the best photos I've seen in a football book. A true pleasure to view, and an excellent coffee-table book. Info is slightly lacking, but overall the book is a good buy."
4,"Nice 3D, next time just show me the animals","I am a huge fan of wild animal documentaries and it's exciting to see these critters in 3D. I just wish they would leave out the preview ad in the beginning, and the scenes with Hunter Ellis walking around. I don't want to see a guy walking through a village, just show me the animals. This is the top (and only) safari 3D blue-ray movie to choose from at this time so it's still a great experience!"
1,Chul Lee,"I am sorry for give you one star. one word disappoint, no story making. and story for the too high price. need more 3d action and own story."
4,Great experience in 3D,"I enjoy this safari in 3D. Is well made. Zero crosstalk. A great acomplisment, I hope for other trips like this."
3,3d africa,to much dialog from Hunter Ellis it seem as if he is the focus of the documentary. i think it would be better if his voice was in the background. theres is no need to see him or his truck
3,Good 3d movie,This was a good 3D movie to watch. Some of the animals looked like they could get you. It was a great learning tool. I am happy we bought it. There aren't enough 3d movies out there
3,scrub it yall,"so..here's the deal . been use'n similar products for 20 plus years. they work, get the job done. nothing like a good facial scouring tuh start out yer day . can't beat it."
3,"Better than the newer one, IMHO","This movie covers a lot of ground in the Dredd mythos: Mega City One, The Cursed Earth, The Angel Gang (!), The Long Walk, The Dredd/Rico relationship; 20 years of mythology in a 90 minute movie. Stallone's catchphrase never works, but Rob Schneider does bring badly needed comedy relief. I like it better than a lot of either people, because it's a big, dumb, comic movie. Still beats Superman IV or Batman and Robin anyday..."
4,The Law is the Word!,"The hit action epic is on video! Stallone is Judge Joe Dredd in a bleak future set long away from now. Capture the excitement! Based solely from the 2000AD comic strip. This is one recommended for sci-fi and action fans, and for lovers of other futuristic fiction such as Blade Runner. END"
3,BRAINLESS = Entertaining none the less!,"Judge Dredd is an actoin movie. Period. It's great brainless fun if you just want to see a bunch of grungy future guys shooting guns and blowing stuff up. If you want a thinking action movie, get Ronin or the French Connection.Visually, I thought this was one of the best comic book adaptations ever, up on the level as the original 1989 Batman. The unique armor and city style of the U.K. Judge Dredd series definitely shines through true to the comics. If this movie had sound effects written into the screen, it would easily come across as watching a comic. Beautiful.All in all, this movie is wonderfully bad. Cheesy lines, Stallone playing a role perfectly suited for him, lots of violence. Perfect movie for a night where you just want to let your brain rest with a bad action movie."
5,He is the law,"The movie had good effects for the time; also had a good mix of established actors and relatively new ones at the time. The story line was as close as a movie can get to the original comic story line and still be popular, set a good example for the endless line of comic book based movies that have been produced over the last few years. Great entertainment."
2,A waste of a great idea.,"I grew up reading the 2000AD comics which introduced Judge Dredd , and I remember really looking forward to seeing what could be done with the character.The timing of the movie appeared so right Stallone and Schwarzenegger seemed at the peak of their appeal to the movie going audience. Consequently a monosyllabic... law enforcer against a Sci-Fi backdrop couldn't miss, could it ?Unfortunately here it did, in the original comics ( to the best of my recall ) Dredd never removed his helmet, that part could have played by anyone. Instead of paying a ludicrous 'star' salary that money could have been spent on the movie, where it was really needed - am I the only one who cringed at some of the dialog, laughed at the special effects and blinked as some of the sets shook ?This could have been the seed of a great movie franchise, instead a comic strip that enthralled kids throught the 70's was pulped into nothing in an hour and half. What a shame."
1,"Great Movie,Lousy Disc","Get the movie on conventional dvd,save money,and be happy.The movie is great!The blue ray version,however,is a rip-off.No special features other than the trailer,and many of these blue ray versions of 'Dredd' are not region 1 (U.S.A.) compatible...I love the movie,I just wish somebody cared enough to add features like cast and crew audio commentary.When you've made a great movie,you should take some pride in it.Feature length audio commentary is the most important special feature.If you've already seen the movie many times,watching it with audio commentary allows you to see the movie from somebody else's perspective,which makes the movie new again...Sly Stallone's audio commentary for the first Rambo movie is a great example for making something old new again.Watching Rambo while listening to Stallone talking about it was almost like seeing the movie for the first time.You gain a new perspective that you didn't have before."
2,Sony Battery,The battery life does not even come close to the advertised listing. Save your money and wait until Sony does a better job. I am a big fan of all things Sony and this is my first big disappointment.Mark
2,A patchwork monster,"Another motley McGraw-Hill product. First copyrighted in 1913. The author appears to have died prior to 1976, and the book has been maintained by hired help. Don't try to use this as a textbook; treat it as a reference only. You never really know whether some item is up to date or 50 or 80 years old. Examples: There is a lot of treatment of two-phase (yup, 90 degrees) power, including at 25 hertz, and of multi-kilovolt series incandescent streetlighting, plus knob and tube wiring. Also, it is stated that the highest radio frequency in use is 30 megahertz, whereas in reality we're up to 1,000 or 2,000 times that just now. This book is a curiousity; charming if you have the cash, but if you don't, maybe you should be getting something more coherent."
2,Not a handbook,"I would NOT recommend this book to any electrician, engineer, or architect. It is extremely difficult to comprehend. Gaining any practical information from this book is futile. I have had the twelfth edition over ten years. I used it to study for the electricians exam. I hated it then. Since that time, I have found it to be a very poor reference book. The thirteenth edition is no better. I understand why some electrician training schools might use this book - it is very comprehensive. It would make a good reference for a classroom lesson plan, but not a direct teaching tool. If you want to learn the material in this book, get the National Electric Code Handbook (and related materials published by the NFPA) and appropriate textbooks. FYI - I am a licensed electrician and a registered professional engineer."
5,Basic Math To Algebra Presented In Puzzle Form,"A self-directed, hands-on approach to math that allows students to progress independently. If you appreciate academics presented and/or reinforced in game-form, you'll appreciate the 35 puzzles that begin with addition and end with square roots. As a gifted intervention specialist, the author welcomes all questions through her e-mail address noted within the introduction."
3,hr stopped working after 30 min.,"just got this watch about 24 hours ago. first it was working great.and i like it lots more then the polar rs200. i used the watch in my small water pool without the hr-sensor.after that the watch did not get any hr from the hr sensor.it the watched showed 00 for about 20 min.then it was working fine again.today i drove my car,the hr sensor in my trunk.the watch started beeping. so i checked it.watch showing me 230 bt/hr. i did't wear the hr sensor. remember, the sensor was in the trunk.tomorrow i will replace it for the same model."
2,not just Pompeii,"I found it interesting to learn years ago, that another huge ship had sunk before the Titanic. This work may interest many as it explains that Pompeii was not the only Roman town to be destroyed by the eruption.The work emphasizes that the tragedy for the people of the time is our triumph because we got to learn how they lived. This work shows that even bread was preserved by the volcanic elements. Researchers could even see that one victim was seven months pregnant.Still, if you've seen documentaries on Pompeii, then you've seen this. Since the same thing happend, the only original point is that it happened in a different place."
4,Good book,"The text is a little outdated, but the overall fitness concepts are not. Great place to start from as the routines start simple and then graduate. One thing I've noticed is the author's advice to avoid swimming for weight loss. I've recently dropped 30lbs and 5 pant sizes by swimming (aside from push-ups, sit-ups, etc.).Definitely a good place to start from anyway."
4,"never thought I would need a book to run!, but I was wrong","Well, I will be honest there is not much you will probably learn from this book that you can't find somewhere or already acquired as common knowledge. However, I was a first time runner for 10k, and it would have been difficult for me to complete the race with the time I did without the 13 week program in this book. If you can rent this in your local library, do it, but it was not available in my local library. In my opinion, the price is worth it for the 13-week program alone."
5,Great book for beginning runners,"I had been running for six months before reading this book. I was trying to train on my own and did not get very far. This book introduces a very specific program for beginning runners which is effective, safe, and relatively easy. I recommend it to anyone who would like to start running but is not sure exactly where or how to start. The book is pretty short and to the point, covering pretty much anything a new runner needs to be aware of. Highly recommended."
3,Too Advanced for a Beginner.,"This book is not for an absolute beginner. I've been looking for books that were geared towards the beginning runner and this is not one of them. The author assumes that the reader has some knowledge of running. There's very little mention about running in hot and cold weather, nutrition, goal setting, how to avoid injury or pacing. If you've never ran before, I don't recommend this book at all. It's a great book, just not for a beginner. Try ""Runner's world complete book of running"""
1,All Fluff no Substance,"This is mostly fluff. One hundred and fifty pages of feel good stuff before it gets to a running plan. I'm really not interested in running while pregnant or choosing the right stroller! Cameo's of runners take up about twenty five percent of the book. Again there's really no meat on the subject. Maybe it was my mistake thinking there would be more here,it does say BEGINNING, but the book suggests you are an absolute novice to running and maybe life in general."
4,JUMPSTART YOUR WEIGHT LOSS!,"Having trouble just getting started? Too busy, too tired, too whatever? GET THIS TAPE! IT WORKS! I even had a hard time listening to it everyday as instructed and after three weeks I'm ""automatically"" WANTING to and DOING things that after twoyears is finally sending my weight down instead of up. Yeah,you still have to cut down on food and you do have to do someexercise, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HARD. I'm pleased with mypurchase and will buy another one because I'm afraid my tape will wear out now. I'M LOSING WEIGHT! ME! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!"
5,A Jounery into madness,"Scene by scene ""Withnail and I"" take's you to the theatre with out leaving your chair. A very funny film, a great insight into human relationships at there best/worst."
1,This is a trap stay away.,"If you are one of those who entered the imdb.com recommended link and ended up here looking for a comedy or even anything remotely entertaining then I can promisse you that buying this or its sister movie will leave you disapointed. And I feel that it is my duty to warn you. Comon, drinking lighterfluid and rolling megajoints hasnt been funny for over thirty years, not since the days of the Big Bamboo record, with which this movies atmosphere bears no resemblance at all. Gay people, farmers, villagers, drunks, poacher, stoned people, dirty dishes, weekend in the country, DUI, contry animals, if this makes you amused and happy then go ahead, I completely missed the point. Two drunks rolling over each other and a weekend with their gay uncle in the contry. There, I just saved you 25 bucks."
5,"""If I spike you, you'll know you've been spoken to.""","This is actor/filmwriter Bruce Robineson first movie to write and direct. He won an Oscar for his script on ""The Killing Feilds"" and his talent of wit and diolouge gets a work out here.Grant plays Withnail with such charm and crisma you'll love to hate him but hate to love him. ""I"" is played by Paul McGann wonderfully also.This movie is a british cult comedy classic. The script and the acting realy hold this movie to gether. Upon eatch veiwing you will find more and more and pick up on other jokes you have missed.This DVD is worth every penny. If you liked Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas you will love this...this movie is slightly more enjoyable then ""...Vegas"" because the 2 charecters in the movie are friends not just a pair of drugies."
5,"Great, but the ""cut"" line is a misnomer","Just a little clarification - the film on video is not really ""cut."" It's the same as the film release from 1987, which I accidentally saw about 6 times in Toronto whilst skipping a 2nd year calculus class. The last video version (not the new one) was the first to include the bit about the thumbs, and I was surprised to see it. As it wasn't in the one I had seen and memorized in the cinema it didn't seem to fit."
4,I'd See This Set,"Wunschkonzert...Popular Concert. It should speak for itself what it entails. It's classic concert pieces. Material that mostly every layman should know. I remember as a child watching a Bugs Bunny short with music from von Suppe's Poet and Peasant. Everyone who's seen Raging Bull or Godfather Part III is familiar with the Intermezzo from ""Cavalleria rusticana"". Mendelssohn Bartholdy's The Wedding March needs no introduction, nor does Katschaturian's Sabre Dance and anyone who knows The Bad News Bears knows Carmen.These are songs that's infused with the public conscience and this is the opportunity to have them in a single collection apart from the Keystone Kops where you can appreciate them simply for it's musical genius. This is an album that is infectious, sometimes downright silly, and a joy for everyone who appreciates music."
3,Very detailed discography.,"I would like to see a lot of big full colour pictures intead of just a bunch of newspaper style black and white shots.I also would like to read more about Vangelis likes and dislikes.Being a musician and composer myself, I find really hard to believe Vangelis realtime composition and production techniques are true, given the high complexity of most of his work. Whit that I say that in this book Vangelis appears very idealized and a more realistic angle is needed.As a conclution: this is not a book to keep if you are not interested in getting vangelis complete discography."
5,Absolutly One Of The BEST...,"Melanie wanted to make a feel good album and this one is what it is. every song is good. this is one of the cd's that i can put in and listen to the whole thing. and the dvd is awesome, its like 40 minutes long, and it is neat to see her house and how she lives life in l.a. she truley did a wonderful job. it has a vary of styles from, rock, r & b, dance (80's style), & latin. a great buy, nice to listen to on a relaxing but hot summer day."
3,"Not good, not bad.","I must say that after listening the progress of Mel C, Emma, Geri, even Victoria in a few tracks I heard on the internet of her never released album, I think Mel B shows less progress doing an album like this.LA State of Mind has both good and bad, but is not as good as many Spice albums. It has great songs such as Beautiful Girl, which I think is the best and it could have been better as a single than Today. Other great songs are Stay in bed days, LA State of Mind and Hold on. But Sweet pleasure... I hate that song as the same as Forever's ""Time goes by"" and Hot's ""Hell no"". I consider Music of the Night a copy of Geri's Mi Chico Latino because of the style (and is not as good as Geri's).I'm going to say, this album is OK, but only for Spice Girls's fans, specially Mel B's fans."
5,Trickster Tales,"American Indian Trickster Tales is a great way to spend the time, be it on a train, boat or jet. Myths and legends about the Coyote, the Spider-Man, the Raven and Master Rabbit. Shape shifters, fill of greed and cunning, this characters are always getting into trouble. The stories are sometimes funny, sometimes gross and sometimes a tad kinky, but they are old as the first humans to come to America and play an important part of Indian culture, past and present. But NOT for kids."
2,pilates fan,"This should not be labelled as a pilates workout. There is really only a small section with a condensed mat workout. The rest is very flowy, dancy low-impact exercise. Some of which could be hard on the knees if done improperly. Lots of deep plie type stuff. It might work for you if this is the exercise you want, but if you are looking for PILATES, don't buy this. I wish I hadn't. Even the beginning Gaiam series with ""perky"" Ana Caban is better."
3,HELP,What is the answer to the puzzle posed in the story and featured on the book's cover? What is the 4th figure in the series:M Heart underscored 8
3,"a fun, math-ish mystery","As a math teacher and a fan of mysteries, I couldn't resist picking up this book and reading it. It's a short, fun, clever mystery. In it, a serial killer seems to be playing games with a prominent mathematician, leaving cryptic clues. Filled with mathematicians and mathematical ideas, this novel might not be engaging to those with little interest or connection to this world. I enjoyed that aspect, though. This story felt more like a puzzle, with the murders feeling a bit artificial, like deaths in a video game. This kept my interest, though, for all 197 pages. For those who like math and puzzles, you might like this."
4,An Excellent Resource,I used this book to study for the LAST and ATS-W tests--and passed them both with PERFECT scores. This book provided excellent preparation--the format and questions were even more difficult than the actual exams.
1,Not a good fit,"I just purchased an older style Palm and it came with one of these replacement styli. It really is too big no matter how hard you try to push it down. I looked around for other replacement styli on Amazon and found a Belkin version and another version that have good reviews.However, instead of shelling out for new ones right away, I just snipped the tip off of the one I have and filed it to a point again with sandpaper. Fits snugly, looks good and works perfectly."
1,"Worthless, do not buy!",Requires to be linked to a website that does not exist anymore. The thing is totally junk and is an utter waste of money. Dont make the mistake I did. AVOID!!!!
1,Don't buy!,"I loved this pedometer and have worn it for years! Apparently the company has gone out of business and now my pedometer is worthless. It only holds so many steps before you have to upload it to their website and it clears it. No website= inability to clear the memory. Well, not necessarily, I suppose I could remove the battery, but this is not why I spent this much money on a pedometer! So disappointed!"
2,Thank God I didn't Pay a lot,"The Black 6, about a gang of black, vietnam vets who fight racism in a southern town, after one of their brothers was killed was very phony. The Klansman I expected more from Lee marvin and OJ Simpson. Needless to say both movies were horrible! I would not recommend it."
4,A Dangerous Mourning -- Anne Perry,Interesting Victorian life style details along with Perry's usual women's right subtheme. Hard to guess whodunit!!
5,Valuable quick and handy resource!,This valuable and easy to handle and store resource has proven to be valuable to me. I have a green house and use it all the time.
3,Gardening Books,"Hard cover, simple, excellent book for kids. Not a trouble shooter fror experts AT ALL."
2,Rent It!,"Those expecting any type of insight on the lives or careers of Shakur or Biggie should probably avoid. While there is some mention of Biggie, most of the film is dedicated to the murder investigations.While the ""truth"" behind what really happened should obviously be the focus of this film, I felt that a lot more should have been done with telling the audience the backstory. There is little to no mention of the actual feud that these two had. If you don't know anything about Death Row or the artists in the title then you may have trouble following the film. Most of the facts are presented poorly and some of the information like the reports of Snoop being scared for his life are poorly-researched, one-sided, and very much opinionated.As a huge fan of this entire story, I was bored to death and those who would like a more professional-looking account of the events may want to check out the VH-1 ""Behind The Music"" on The Notorious B.I.G."
3,More holes than Tupac and Biggie,"The maker here claims the LAPD's rogue cops, moonlighting as Death Row Records security, helped kill Tupac because he was demanding $10m from Suge Knight, who commanded his dirty cop friends to shoot Tupac and make it look like an East Coast/West Coast rap feud. Biggie had to be killed a few months later to maintain the fiction. It may well be true. However, nowhere do we see the LAPD responding, nor any responsible attorney or any legitimate media, such as the LA Times, which got into trouble over this case. Still, it's an enjoyable entertainment, even if the filmmaker's ethics and medthods and editing are questionable. It doesn't really answer who killed either rapper. Suge Knight's prison interview never mentions the killings."
4,Very Compelling,I've seen so many Documentarys on 2Pac&Biggie&Read Countless pieces here&there.add this to the pile of Very Compelling&interesting Viewing&theory.funny how so many people have Cashed in on there far to young lives that were taken way before there time&yet nobody is willing to step forward with any answers on there deaths.this Documentary asks&has it's own take on things.this is a story that truly will not go away because these Two Cats left a Major Impact on Rap-Hip-Hop World&the Pop World at large as well.
1,"Thanks for trying, not worth buying","If you like ABBA then don't buy this CD. It is not worth listening to as it does not contain the same level of music and production. Skip to Agnetha and you'll find a more suitable sound, a better voice and better production"
3,good,"expensive, but that's the problem with printer cartridges, they are expensive and the color doesn't last long so I have to be careful when to use color."
3,"Helpful, but dated.","I bought this DVD in the store where I take the Wilton method classes. While I did find that this video had some helpful information, the vid was DATED! It looked like it was filmed in the early, and I do mean early '80's. Remember, this video serves 2 purposes: it shows the viewer different ways of building multi-level cakes, and to present Wilton's products. It would have been nice to see some of the newer products put to use to make some of the more modern cakes. However, the information provided was clear and easy to follow. The hostess demonstrated 4 methods of stacked constrution. If you do decide to buy this video, consider buying a book; Wilton, or otherwise with more modern designs."
3,opnion,"Cooks food twice as fast as a regular oven and can accommodate large food items. I am very pleased with this convection and rotisserie oven, it is multipurpose to no end. BUT I never tried the bake cycle (till last week), this the worst part of the oven ------- it does not have bake cycle ------- the BROILER goes on. It's hard not to burn something you wanna bake."
4,Useful counter oven...,"We were planning on redoing our kitchen and after our range broke we were in need of an interim oven. It does everything, We used it to bake cookie, pizzas, and even cook a small turkey for Thanksgiving. I have to admit when I received it, the size was larger than I had imagined, so it does take up quite a significant amount of counter space. The down side is that it gets very hot on the outside while in use so it can be very dangerous if in reach of small children. We ended up putting it on top of the refrigerator out of reach for this reason."
4,Great little oven.,I've never owned a toaster oven or much less anything this size. It is a great oven that looks nice sitting on our counter top. I also love using the rotisserie and it has plenty of room for a 4-5lb chicken (probably even a bigger). It does get very hot on the top and sides so keep anything flammable far away. I've only had it a few weeks so I can't speak for the durability but it looks and feels pretty solid. I highly recommend this product.
1,Worthless,"We bought this rotisserie to make our own rotisserie chickensat home. That was the only thing we really need from it.The manufacturer says it's rated for 5 pound chickens - ok,it's not exactly easy to find them then small, but we did. Fivepounds exactly. Trussed the bird, firmly attached to the rodexactly according to the directions - it spun reasonably wellfor about 20 minutes. But then it just stalled out! The motorwas groaning and the chicken was sort of flopping back andforth a bit. So we pulled it out and finished in the oven.We tried another time - this time managed to find a 4.5 poundchicken. EXACT same result. The last try was a FOUR POUND EVENchicken we managed to find.... SAME THING.It just went to Goodwill. Waste of money - cheaply built,and useless for the very thing it's advertised for."
1,Don't Bother !,"The oven came out of the box DEFECTIVE -- it did not heat at all! The rotisserie turned, the lights came on, but NO HEAT at all! I removed the chicken and tried plain 'ol baking -- NO HEAT. Now I have to drag the darn thing back to the store! No more Hamilton Beach products for me! If Hamilton Beach's ""quality control"" does not detect such a major problem, how can they detect smaller ones?"
2,disappointment,"I am extremely disappointed in the oven. I do not like the fact they say not to use foil....as it interferes with the browning...it does not seem to cook as fast as my old convection countertop. (it was a faberware and I loved it....took all size pans,) this one is very limited on sizes....and does not seem to cook as fast as my old Faberware. Perhaps I am comparing too much but I had it over 20 years, it finely gave up...and although I paid slightly more it did all the jobs you could ask for. This oven does not...have not tried the roterisserie and doubt that I will. Again I would not purchase this the second time...and the reason I did not purchase a Faberware convection was because Amazon did not have one. Be wary of if..and plan to be disappointed."
3,Lasted 2 1/2 yrs.,"I bought this at Sam's Club 2 1/2 yrs ago and it was a dandy little oven. A few of my friends bought it, too. Over the past three weeks, we've had a problem with overheating after setting at 325F or 350F, resulting in burned tops of food. The convection feature is questionable. I haven't continued to use that because I didn't see an appreciable difference in time saved or quality of cooking. Next purchase will be without convection. At least this performed well for more than two years."
2,was not impressed at all!!! and I am an engineer!,I don't know about everyone else but this thing was flimsy and the door didn't not completely close square since day one. Nobs are very cheaply built
4,"Larger, but Better?","I paid $78 for mine in late Nov. 2009, and so far it's worked fine.Nothing fancy, just larger overall size. The dual rack design sounds good,but I have found that if we cook (2) pizza's at the same time,the top one gets more done on top, and guess what, the bottom pizzagets more done on the bottom. This is while using the ""convection"" feature.I haven't used the rotisserie yet (and probably won't).Overall, this is has been a very good toaster oven, but nothing special...Go for the best buy when looking for a new item like this.Generally speaking, I've found most of them to be about the same."
4,Good product for the money,"This little oven saved me at Thanksgiving. My only complaint is that it would only take one inch more to enable it to fit a 13x9 pan. You can't make a two layer cake in it because you need to put the rack in the middle position but I have made pies, smaller cakes, meatloaf, casseroles etc. etc. in it and have been very happy with it's performance. I have not used the rotisserie function yet."
4,Pretty good,"This is not a $500 Cuisinart, but then it's not $500. I found mine at Macy's for about thirty percent less than most retailers, and at that price it was certainly worth trying. I bought mine to replace a fifteen year old toaster oven that I often found myself pushing beyond its limits. (It also caught fire while toasting frozen lumpia, but that's another story)Plusses? Inexpensive, large capacity, room to cook a small turkey or a couple loaves of bread without heating up the big stove. Minuses? It's kind of lightweight. The rotisserie won't handle much of a load. It's slow to heat up, especially compared to the typical toaster over. And it won't make toast.But overall, it's not a bad deal, and if you entertain with a small kitchen- as I do- it's pretty useful.---Followup: I've had this oven for two and a half years now, and it's still in almost daily use. You can't say that about too many inexpensive products these days."
1,On/Off control knob is wearing out bad after 7 months,"On/Off control is wearing out. Called Service Center, they want to send whole new unit for $20.00 and you have to send back the cord from old unit. So it may cost you a total of $25.00 for a part that should be available at no charge. I should give this unit a 5 but customer service to me is 95% of the product."
1,piece of garbage,"The oven temperature is off by 50 degrees! And if you can get it to the correct temperature, the 1st time you open the door it drops down 10 degrees and doesn't come back up quickly. Preheat takes a min. of 30 minutes. Overall, it's just a big hot mess!"
1,Someone stuffed up,"This cd is advertised as ""Spencer Davis Group"". Wrong. Sung by Davis only and, believe me, without the group backing, he is not the best.Not recommended.CheersBoris"
4,"Case is good, strap is not","I bought this case to transport C-stands for photography lighting on an overseas trip. The case is very sturdy but the strap that holds the lid on just has a simple plastic clip to hold it in place. It would have been better if it had a metal clasp that allowed you to place a padlock on it. To get around this issue, I bought a TSA approved strap with a lock on it and rivetted the strap to the lid and case to create a more secure solution. It held up just fine during the flight, other than the TSA opened the strap and didn't strap it back down tightly again, but that is a whole other story."
3,cute,"A very cute clock for my son's bedroom. Only problem is that it is very hard to see the small red hour/minute hands, even from close up."
5,This is a great CD,"If you're looking for new female talent, then Annie is a good start. I saw her when she opened for kd lang in Australia few years ago. The crowd was only interested in seeing kd and at first they were impatient with her, but she won them over with her pleasant manner and beautiful singing voice. This CD is a good showcase for her talents. All the songs are terrific and they lend themselves to singing along and dancing around the living room (well, that's what I did anyway!)I always play this CD when I need an uplift in mood or when I'm stressed from working all day. A glass of wine and Annie Crummer and suddenly the world makes sense once more.Buy this CD, even though it's an expensive import because it's well worth the money."
1,Copyright violation,"This edition breaches copyright and is published without the permission of the copyright owner and literary executor of Douglas Goldring,Polly Bird, PhD."
3,Read it at night,"Clive Barker is the poetic horror writer. This book starts out with a bang and continues throughout. Very short book which can be read in one sitting with no problem. Very entertaining, and somewhat thought provoking."
2,Diapponting game. Kid got bored quite fast. Has bug when using with GBA,"My boy really wanted to buy this game. Game turned disappointing. My kid achieved higher levels (too) fast and then hit a bug that prevent from continue into next level. Searched the Internet and it turns out the bug does appear on (some?) GBA devises.Anyway, not recommended."
1,PokeMon Leaf Green,The game itself is lots of fun but at a certain spot the game malfunctions and you can go no further. This did not show up until a week after I started playing the game.
1,Absolutely Horrible!!!!!,"The seller lied about the condition of the game, sent what seems to be a bootleg copy that doesn't even load the starting movie for the begging of the game. I bought the game for close to twenty dollars and should have gotten it for free with how horrible it is. I will never buy from this seller again"
3,Leaf Green review,"Leaf green is great for younger kids. I played it about 6 or 7 years ago when it came out and it was fun, then sold it back and bought a new one. I would recommend getting it if you're 8-13 but don't get it for the memories."
4,Great Idea,"I purchased the Kettler Sprint Balance Bike (Princess version) for my 4 year old daughter. I read the reviews before ordering so I was pre-warned about the poor installation directions (and they were). If you are not too handy you may want to have someone help you with the installation. But, I was able to put the bike together with little problem. I gave the bike 4 stars based on it's quality. I had to send it back however, because it was too small for my four year old (no problem at all with the return). This is a great product for a 2-3 year old however. It is a small bike however and will not work for taller children.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A5OS2K/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Go for a Roady XT,"I picked up the Sportscaster after seeing some pretty good rebate deals from XM. I got it and all seemed great: Smaller design, remote, easy to see screen, etc. It wore off after about a week. The mounting bracket is terrible. The radio hardly stayed on the bracket. The antenna jack also seemed pretty shotty. The antenna would be plugged in snug, but everytime I hit a bump or the car shook a little more the signal was lost and the 'Check Antenna' screen would come on. It happend way too often. Before I finally got rid of it the buttons on the unit began not working. I guess I pressed the power button on the unit too hard and it got in contact with the channel changing buttons because the channels would change by itself. I now have an XT and couldn't be happier. Better cradle, larger display and just a better product."
5,Wow,"Yossi and Jagger was beautiful. It was about the love of two soldiers. The acting was wonderful. Wow, the acting was amazing. You could really see the emotions of each character.It was, i guess, a cliched story, true, but really still a great film. It was short and sweet. It was also bittersweet. I mean although the ending was sad, I couldn't help but feel hopeful for the characters. This movie's worth recommending, and don't be surprised to be tearful at the end.I can't help but feeling that one particular character lost just about everything. They had a secret relationship, and in the end, it was like it never existed. There was no proof, nobody knew of it, and nobody would know ever of it, and that was what was devastating for me. To have a future, then to have nothing in an instant. (the ending with living room made me think this)"
4,Cramped but eloquent,"Eytan Fox's film about the unlikely love between two Israeli soldiers packs a lot, probably too much, into a small space--in its seventy minutes' running time there are more than half a dozen sharply delineated characters and several plot strands. Yet the film succeeds for two reasons: Fox's ability to convey the claustrophia of life in a military bunker--the obvious low budget is turned to advantage here--and the efforts of an Israeli cast that is not only attractive but talented, with particularly excellent work from the two male leads and the beautiful Aya Steinovitz as a wistful female soldier. Though the course of the plot is ultimately predictable and there are some uncertainties of tone, lurching between harsh realism and gauzy romance (a slow-motion snowball fight, of all things, is interpolated at one point), overall, the film takes a potentially explosive issue and makes it work through its low-key naturalism and refusal to overdramatize."
2,thank God it was short,"The only positive thing about *Yossi & Jagger* was that it was a short film, at 65 minutes.After having watched a considerable amount of foreign films, I expected this movie to move at a slow pace. While it was slow, I was waiting for story to pick up or capture my attention. It failed to do so.Yossi and Jagger are two soldiers in an Israeli army, monitoring the Lebanese border. Unknown to their comrades, they are lovers. They go off in little missions together only to spend intimate moments with each other. Jagger wants Yossi to leave the army but Yossi loves the military life.Things change for Yossi and Jagger when a colonel arrives and warns them of a possible ambush that evening. The ambush will ultimately decide the fate of their relationship.Fairly simple yet severely underdeveloped. You're not missing anything if you never get the chance to watch this film."
4,Great Purchase!,This was a great buy! I was a little hesitant to purchase this item but it came in a sealed package and works well.
5,Great strategy game.,"I enjoyed playing this game with my 9 year-old son. He had a lot of fun too and won. It was very interesting to play this game after playing Mancala. The placement of the tiles and scoring for the different designs created make it more complex and requires more thought. It also took us a little longer to play than Mancala. I thought I would have to go easy on my son, but obviously I was wrong."
1,UNIMPRESSIVE,"I was hoping to engender interest in Da Vinci in two grandsons with this game, but all it did was bore and confuse them."
2,Overall disappointed,"I really enjoyed Starsailor's first album 'Love Is Here.' I was a little excited to get this album. In the end I ended up being disappointed with the album. Some of the songs sounded a little corny to me. It seems like Starsailor started to have a more Travis sound to them and I'm not the biggest Travis fan. Some of their songs sound like something that would fit perfectly with Love Is Here which made the album boring as well. I don't know why Starsailor included the song 'Born Again.' I remember it being released as a B-Side, and the album version sounds like it's been downgraded compared to the one they released in one of their singles. The only song that caught my attention is 'Telling Them.' The strings in that song make it beautiful but sadly it's the only highlight for the whole album."
3,More Resources,"Ms. Martin seems to be knowledgeable on the subject & takes many oportunities to sing her own praises. I wish she would've spent more time pointing reader into the direction of helpful resources, people, references, etc. I finished the text feeling I had lots of good ideas, but no where to go for further support and information. Finally, compared to other similar books, the purchase price of the book is extremely high. (Maybe she needs to help pay for all those houses she owns :-) )"
5,Kudos for an original approach to organic cooking!,"How wonderful to find the work of Pamela McKinstry again! Over many years of using her superb receipes from her Nantucket cookbooks, which are no longer in print, you cannot imagine my delight in picking up ""Food to Live By"" and seeing her contribution.After having just purchased the cookbook, I delved immediately into four receipes which were simply devine. The ""Summer Berry Crisp"", ""Sweet Corn Chowder"", the ""Yukon Gold Risotto"" and of course (!) the ""Original Morning Glory Muffin"" all of which were gobbled up by delighted guests. The receipes,cooking instructions, photos and field guides are a joy to read and peruse and make ""Food to Live By"" a terrific cookbook for any level of cook, to enjoy and utilize for years to come!"
4,turbo jam,an excellent work out it should be double the time. But it is a fat burner. I have one week using it and I already lost 4 pounds.
5,Awesome Self-Study Bible Course,Just got finished with this self-study course and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a great introduction to the Bible and helpful to those like me that are somewhat familiar with it. Having to look up all the bible verses to answer the questions really helps in getting a handle on where each chapter is so you don't have to spend gobs of time just looking for the chapter.I wish Derek Prince had more books like this. It was very helpful and easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting more information on the Bible for both new Christians and those that have been Christians for a long time.The book is a good size with plenty of room for writing down the answers to the questions. Left me wanting more!
4,Entertaining and engrossing!,"This book was excellent! Mr. Malensek's book was an outstanding read. I found it every bit as entertaining and as much a ""techno-thriller"" as a Tom Clancy novel, but WITHOUT the annoying liberal-bashing and Ronald Regan worship that Mr. Clancy can't seem to keep away from lately. I found this to be refreshing. I literally could not put this book down. The diary style of narration, along with the ""news clippings"" really held my interest, and made it more fun to read. With the current events in the news of late, this book is starting to look frighteningly real. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys military fiction! I am looking forward to reading ""The Xmas War"" next."
2,Not really worth it,"I love Penguin's chocolate caffeine mints, but it seems they aren't selling them any more, so I tried these. The taste is pretty unpleasant, and to get any caffeine you have to eat several of them, so for me they really aren't worth buying."
2,Something for my daughter to teeth on...,"My daughter is 5 months old and loves to watch Rolie Polie Olie. My husband and I have grown very fond of it, too. Now that I am building her ""library"", I want to include books that will spark an interest in books throughout her life. I beleived that this book would be perfect because she is already familiar with Olie and the other characters on the show. HOWEVER...once I received the book and began to read, a feeling of ambivalence came over me. I was dissapointed that the words did not ""flow"" well and became monotonous. As a parent, (the one who is actually going to read this book), I had hoped for more. But, I'm sure my daughter will enjoy the art."
3,Nice COLD air,"It gets the job done, but its pretty big.The two fan speeds put out super noise, so I'm going to have to return it, I'm just trying to cool an avg size room, so this one just won't work for me.It does do a great job at putting out cold air, so if you got a big room and can take the noise, you won't be sorry...."
2,Loved the book...hated the television adaptation,"Loved the book...hated the television adaptation. But what else is new, I usually hate a movie or television adaptation of a novel. When will I learn to stop watching them is a better question. This one really sucked. The characters and the whole tone of this production were completely unlike that of the novel. Such a disappointment. The producers of this trash decided to place more emphasis on a character that played a much smaller role in the second part of the novel, and decided to build the entire story around her pathetic and uninteresting life. Then they inserted additional characters that did not appear in the book and drastically changed the plot. The main character is now an unsympathetic twit of a woman who cares only about her career to the detriment of all else. The wonderful story has been butchered...like a pretty woman who has a botched cosmetic surgical procedure and is now an ugly hag."
3,"Good general info,some good designs, no instructions","Good information on types of windows and styles of window treatments, hardware, trims. Each page has sharp color pictures. Some current styles, but some seem slightly dated. Instructions are not provided."
5,Hilarious,"Still the funniest play I have ever read or seen. As a high school drama teacher, I can use countless scenes and monologues from this show for class study and competition. Never a dull moment in the entire script."
1,Slooow Going,"This has GOT to be the slowest moving book I have ever read. To summarize it it sounds like a good storyline, but it was just so slow moving I could hardly push myself to finish it. It just kept going over the same ground again and again. You just couldn't wait for something to happen to resolve the stalemate."
2,Poor quality,"I just received this puzzle as a gift. Having another older-style Chunky puzzle, I am VERY disappointed in the quality. Instead of the designs being painted on, the front of the pieces are paper stickers and scratch off very easily. The old Chunky puzzles were much better quality and last longer. How disappointing that Melissa and Doug should make such poor quality puzzles!"
1,It's about as memorable as yesterdays dinner ....,"OK so I bought into the hype about a hot hot novel with super corruption revalations about American big biz tobbacco industry and instead I got a rerun of the A Team 'in print' no less ....To say that our hero, Shane Scully, lacks depth of character would be an understatement and I can understand why he's ready for the rubber room. I can't realy say that I even like the villan, Jody, another cadiadte for the funny farm. When we get to the tobacco conspiracy issues we are in the middle of the book and the author gets really pretty fuzzy here....I mean where's the big secret, a few years ago Colombia had a member of government that was known as congressman Marlboro ...Sorry the only thing biting and gripping in this book has to be the price I paid for it ....."
5,Great for uncooked fruit desserts,"The sauce used to hold the uncooked strawberries (blueberries, etc.) together is cooked, but not the fruits, so it makes great tartlets, etc."
4,Extra Moist for the Throat,"It helps add moisture to your voice when you talk or sing all day. You have to be VERY careful if you are purchasing it for singing as there is a numbing agent which would make it easier to sing wrong and hurt your voice in the long run. But it great for when you're teaching music all day. I wouldn't take more than 2 squirts at one time and you only need it every couple hours depending upon what you are doing. Just don't spray your tongue, spray at the back of your throat. Since there is medication in it you can taste it which isn't always that great."
3,ALMOST what I hoped for...,"At first I could not get much sound from this speaker so I thought it was practically useless.Then I realized that because I have a plastic cover on my iPod, the cover was not allowing the speaker stem to go fully into the iPod (as the earphones do).In order to get decent sound, I have to remove the cover each time - an inconvenience but at least the product does work - and before I discovered the 'cover factor' I thought I had ordered a bad product overall.I wish they had made the contact stem longer so I did not have to remover the cover."
5,Deep House Classic,"Dubtribe Sound System and Chillifunk have come out with many classics over the years, but combine the two recordings together, and you'll get something that's truely enjoyable. Another great must-have I recommend is True Spirit 2 (also by Chillifunk Recordings)."
3,Great True Story,Although this story is worth watching - the acting leaves much to be desired - Inspirational as the story is.
2,Not Hot Enough,I'm disappointed - this product takes a long time to heat up and then it doesn't get hot enough (and I have fine hair). I'm now looking for something else.
2,Disappointing,Very disappinting. The switch does not stay on because it is so loose. Unfortunately I didn't find this out until I was in Florida on vacation after I threw away receipts and packaging. Mine may be a lemon but I would not advise anyone to purchase.
2,Needs more,"I liked the 1-1/2"" barrel - it was exactly what I wanted. However, the follow through on this is poor. It feel cheap and not very sturdy. My hair (I have fine hair) kept getting caught in the little riser on the center of the iron. The iron itself never heated up well enough to set my hair and it took a good deal of time for it to even get to it's hottest point. I returned it and will be searching for something else."
2,Not hot enough,"I red complaints about the tip being too hot before I bought - the tip seems big enough to me, and I certainly didn't burn myself - it doesn't get hot enough even on high and the bristles are very short. Didn't think it worked well at all."
3,I watch this video again and again!,The sound quality is disappointing but Elton John puts on a masterful show to a very happy audience. All the hit songs are done beautifully and the backup band and effects are great! This concert video is worth your time and money!
1,skip this video elton fans.,"Thie live elton concert fron 1992 in Barcelona Spain leaves much to be desired. First, the music portion sounds muffled, secondly the video has a glare to it. I assume the spotlight has caused this problem. Lastly, the editing on the tape was too quick, it gave ma a headache. The video looks like it was slapped together."
5,Excellent light for the price,I needed something light weight and portable for a project in Guatemala. This light has exceeded my expectations. I'm more that satisfied with the image quality produced.
1,Just bad... awful!,"Movie contains a bunch of Filipinos and people whose lines contains the ""F"" word in every sentence. There was no story. Action sequences are awful."
4,Emotional Chic Rock,"I have never been a huge fan of girl singers, but I went to a Tegan and Sara concert in support of my cousin and have been listening to them ever since. I recommend this cd to anyone with an open mind. Listen to it all the way through about 2 times and it will be hard to take it out of your cd player after that. Every song is great, and they don't get old. The girls are talented and the cd is worth buying!"
5,Love Provide,I had a nutritionist recommend these and they are super. Give you everything you need in a multivitamin.
1,This Book is BAD!!!,"I got this book after my sister has taken the PPST test. I thought it will help me to do well on mine. I should have known better to get other books. Considering that not only my sister did not pass her PPST exam, I totally fell that this book did not help me perpare my exam. If you want to pass the PPST, I suggest you to get another book."
2,DON'T CHOOSE THIS ONE,"This book wasn't a good book to study from. NONE of the math material I learned in this book was reflected on the exam. The practice tests were a little difficult and they gave you explanations to answers, but the test did not reflect what I learned in this book."
1,Way too hard to be helpful.,"I used this book to study for all aspects of the PPST test and found it unrealistically difficult. There were plenty of exercises with no explanations, and the book was advanced to the point of knocking my confidence. I would not buy this book, buy the Cliffs notes review, very easy to read."
4,"Not normal Christian alternative,but good in its own respect","Quite a change from her first, but still good. The music has almost a computer music sound to it and at times sounds even like Nintendo music. The lyrics remain as always challenging in the faith. Half-singing & half-talking creates this unique style the she has. A different sound to add to your collection."
3,"The story of Ruth, Twelve moments in Every woman's Life","I was disappointed in this book. It did not speak to me at my stage of life. I feel it is a great book for younger women in the midst of their life,but as a senior person I had already passed most of the markers pointed out in this story of Ruth and Naomai. I would recommend this book to any woman going through the mid twenties through to the fifties age groups."
3,Not up to Sr. Joan's standards!,"Disappointing! Gosh, this book was just not up to some of the previous books written by Sr. Joan Chittister, OSB. It would be better if she wrote less but higher quality books. We know she is capable of doing greater things.The reflections on Ruth focused too much on activist social justice issues, and not what other women might actually think or feel. It was like the author is in a vacuum, and not able to even place herself in to the role of Ruth or her mother-in-law. After reading a few pages, I started to flip forward looking for the good part; faster and faster until I reached the end.Even the art work didn't save this book. The art was simple and one dimensional - childish. Great art can save a moderate book. When the art is stunning, rich in detail and content, the reader is able to ""read"" the art. And, drink it in with the eyes. A well written icon can tell a fabulous story! Alas, this was not to be that kind of book."
1,AWFUL! Don't waste your money,"This is horrible. It is MAYBE two inches tall and came without packaging and inside a plastic grocery bag, covered in dust. What a waste of money and a horrid seller with no return policy. Just gross. This is the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon. Could not be more disappointed."
3,light but only ok,"The dryer is light and easy to hold, but the speed and heat are not very adjustable (just 2 settings) and it takes a long time to dry my thick hair.For the price, I would not recommend it."
3,It's hot!,Two settings: low hot or high hot. It's really featherweight. Quick drying time but the motor doesn't sound as good as my old Italian made dryer. I wish I had tested it out in person first before buying I would return it but I got it for a song and don't want to pay the shipping cost and 15% restocking fee. It'll do.
4,Hairdryer,"I does not have a difuser, but is a very lite and comfortable grip. Leaves your hair shinny. Like it."
3,hair dryer,"I was very disappointed that the company would not honor the 4 year guarantee because I got this on Amazon. They said it was not a qualified seller. Amazon should also tell buyers that if you purchase this item on Amazon, the company will not honor the 4 year warranty."
5,"Full of life, love, laughter, and tears",A supremely well-done movie that evokes laughter and tears. It touched my heart and brought waves of nostalgia for the 50's and 60's in southern California. The characters and the story are deep and colorful. One of my all-time favorites!
3,Great film. Lousy dvd,"O.k. This film is about a Mexican-American family,right?So here is my second question: Why was this not dubbed in spanish? Some Hollywood studios are really that adamant that they only produce DVDs for the U.S. and Canadian market so they should therefore only carry English and French language soundtracks.With the exception of Universal,Fox Home Entertainment,and MGM which release 95% of their product with a spanish soundtrack, most of the studios will not even subtitletheir releases. Maybe Paramount,WarnerBros. and Columbia should follow this trend a lot more. There are spanish speaking people in Canada, you know? Anyhow, this is a great film and I believe that it would have been better done(and increase my chances of buying it by 90%)had it included a spanish soundtrack."
1,So THIS is the cause of so much crummy rock...,"I really wanted to like this. I really did. I've read so much about this band. Rolling Stone raved about them (that should've been a clue right there...). and then I pushed play....And, what?!? this boring tuneless toneless twaddle comes out! BORING!!! Thank god I borrowed this from the library! I mean! I was really expceting the second coming of rock here!! And it just did not happen. Then it hit me that when it originally came out I never heard one song on the radio, not even college radio (the second clue!). Probably because the stations knew they'd lose listeners.If you're looking for exciting, alive, jump up and down rock, look somewhere else, 'casue this ain't it.Extremely disappointing!!!!"
2,Hmmm...HAH!!!,"ok, this band is not that good.Plain and Simple.They sound like Beck trying to Cover Weezer songs!Whoever said that they are the 90's version of Sgt. Pepper or any Beatles CD is a MORON because this band has no talent compared to the beatles. They have some talent, but not enough to impress me. I must say that some of their tunes are catchy but other than that they are average underground to me.Also, Contuid for Sale sounds like Primus, but in this case, not in a good way.If you really want the 90's version of SGT. Pepper, it's RadioHead...look at their transformation from songs like ""creep"" to ""Motion Picture SOundtrack."" Anyways, yeah, Pavement is just another band that making weird music that doesnt sound good, and attracting alot of emo kids and underground kids to it...just Go listen to The Beatles, or Radio Head or Coldplay or even Dave Matthews Band if your looking for talent..."
1,Ingenious? Maybe. Pain? Certainly.,"Perhaps it is not fair of me to review a book that I didn't finish, but I bought the book on the basis of other reviews read here. The concept of a person born with out the capacity to feel physical pain is an intriguing one indeed. Unfortunately, it is the reader that really suffers the pain of this book. The first 20 or so pages were so stuffed with descriptions of autopsy, blood lettings and other painful and disgusting practices that I finally had to put the book down in revulsion. I still cringe thinking about it. Perhaps there is an audience that would enjoy reading this book, I however, am not among them."
5,Ingenious Pain,"I was fascinated by this beautifully written book several years ago. After a glut of generic crime books that pass for today's literature, I was struck by the original story presented. It was wondrous and put forth an idea I had never considered, a fascinating idea."
2,Asks more questions than it answers,"Such a promising beginning, but like a wet skrocket, this book just doesn't leave the ground. I felt the author was torn between interesting philosophical issues (pain and human nature) and telliing a good story and ended up doing neither particularly well. There is more than enough material in many of the chapters of this novel for a whole book. However by the end, I felt that the narrative had been stretched to fit the plot and I was hungering for more insight. By the end I couldn't have cared less about the central character. One would like the author to rewrite this book in 3 volumes. It could have been a classic. I hate to think Amazon would lose revenues when you don't buy this book, so try Perfume by Patrick Susskind instead. A similar idea, but much better executed."
4,Easily digestible,I loved reading this book as the language used is very attractive.Information introduced in a very reader friendly way and different colours are used to stop you falling asleep.This book explains even tiny things and avoids complicated pionts by referring the in depth reader to Appendices at the back of the book.I recommend this book for any body intrested to get significant information in a short time.This book is very useful and easily digestible specially if English is not your first language.
3,"Author pads book with repetion ""ad nauseum.""",The premise of this novel could be wonderful but the author's constant repetion of the heroine's same thoughts become increasingly tedious. GET ON WITH IT!
4,Very Useful Book,"The right book, at the right time!I wish I had bought this book 1 week earlier, it would have saved a lot of time and frustration."
4,dream .come true,"i like the book, from begining to end,marvelous.great style.i lo all patricia nell warren novelsthanks"
1,Another loser for Ms. Warren,"Actually, this review doesn't even warrant a one star rating. Again, Ms. Warren leads the reader down the road of unbelievable characters with an even larger unbelievable plot and expects a gay man like myself that it deserves a read - WRONG! I found the entire book a ANOTHER feeble attempt by this author to capture some essence of gay life which she fails, again - horribly!!"
2,Not worth much more than a plot summary,"I honestly haven't been terribly impressed with the text so far - I'm only about half way through, but I've lost the motivation to continue. I find the characters fairly obnoxious and the writing contrived - perhaps I missed out on the little bubble of Americana where 28 year old men told the sort of jokes that I would expect from my 80 year old grandmother, but the dialogue seems stilted to me. I think the raciest part of this text is the plot summary and wouldn't really invest time in much beyond that. I find the priest character smarmy and condescending, so much so that it's offputting - he always seems like the gay Richie Cunningham.[...]"
2,I wouldnt buy another Coby again!,"I bought this system about 4 years ago, it worked ok, the sound quality wasnt what I expected but it wasnt bad for the price I paid. Everything was ok until recentally the cd/dvd player went out. The tuner still plays...the bass on it isnt very good but it plays. Also the remote doesnt work the best unless u point it directly into the reciever. If u want cheap for a short period of time this is the product!"
2,Cheap compilation,"I found this in the bargain bin once. I wouldn't have gotten ""(What) In the Name of Love"" without it. I later bought more. As far as chart success, the two groups couldn't be more opposite. Spandau Ballet had struck ""Gold"" several times in the UK, but in the US, they're stuck as ""True"" one-hit wonders. Naked Eyes on the other hand, have had a handful of Top 40 hits here, but in the old country, the only one to chart there was ""Always Something There to Remind Me"" at a paltry #59. Now it's starting to sound like a Yakiv Smirnoff sketch!"
1,Bono is messed up,"I am a huge U2 fan, but this dvd was horrible because of Bono's performance. His voice was alwful and does not sound deep and vibrant instead its high pitchted and very chappy. He also missed many pants and looked like an awful mess and exhausted. U2 fans do not buy this dvd its the worst recording of Bono"
3,Good Vertigo Tour Souvenir- Not a classic Performance though,"Live in Chicago is an accurate documentation of the Vertigo tour and a great souvenir for a fan who attended a concert from the tour. HOWEVER, Live at Slane Castle is, so far, the ultimate U2 DVD with a performance for the ages sure to captivate fans and non-fans alike. That is a hard DVD to live up to, and this one doesn't."
2,Please retire - I can't take anymore!,"I bought this DVD for a friend, and, for some stupid reason, agreed to watch it with her. Just what I wanted to see - four middle-aged men prancing around onstage like a bunch of megalomaniacal idiots. I must admit that I respect Bono for his humanitarian work, but watching him onstage was like listening to someone rake their fingers down a chalkboard. I couldn't help but cringe whenever the camera was pointed at him. The worst part is that when he's gone, I'll still have to put up with Bono Jr. aka Chris Martin (Did anyone see the Grammys? Enough said.) It also doesn't help that their last album was horrible (Vertigo and Love & Peace were the only decent songs). Even the drummer seemed embarrassed to be a part of this travesty. Poor guy. If you enjoy nauseating songs and lead singers with God-complexes, buy this DVD."
4,Chicago DVD: It was like we were there once again,"My wife and I truly enjoyed watching the DVD filmed live from Chicago. We caught the first show on May 7th which we believe was one of the best shows ever. It was nice to see that Hamish Hamilton chose to add some of the burps (undedited footage) from the two evenings especially when Bono apologizies for having a 'frog in his throat' while singing during Elevation. Great camera work, it gave you the feeling of being there once again and it brought back great memories. I would recommend this to any U2 fan or music lover."
5,Staring at the Sun,"This is one of I think only four full length novels that Bowles wrote, and each of them satisfies in a different way.In this book one follows the central character, a New Yorker transplanted into a strange land to begin life afresh, having found no meaning in his previous boring existence. What meaning he will find, and what exactly his new job will be, or even if there really is one, is not clear, and he drifts in an alien society, reacting to what he finds around him. We are pulled onwards with, like him, no idea about where things are heading until out of laziness or ennui, he begins to make decisions that begin to build walls around him.There are several strong characters in the story who one can imagine beyond the end of the story, continuing their different trajectories, but mostly what stays with me is the way that Bowles unflinchingly takes Dyar on towards his fate."
2,Don't bother,"The Nikon original battery has a fourth contact to maintain the CMOS info. This battery does not. I was plagued by error messages saying the camera clock was reset until I figured out what was wrong. Using this battery, the D40 still worked and wrote to the card, though.The ""real"" Nikon battery handled 2 weeks of wildlife shooting in Africa with only one recharge, even with an autofocus and antishake telephoto. I'd get one of the Nikons instead of two of these."
5,LIKE IT SO MUCH.,"NOT JUST A COMEDY!IT IS THE MOVIE I LIKE THE MOST EXCEPT THE PRODUCERS.THE STORY IS ATTRACTIVE, AND THE ACTOR IS SO GOOD."
1,Birdcage [VHS],I had no idea My favorite movie was going to be a VHS instead of DVD. It cost too much to return it so I'm stuck with a movie that I have absolutely no means to watch. DHayes
2,Read the whole description before ordering.,"The DVD arrived on time but unfortunately I did not notice that the DVD was PAL or UK brand. Therefore my present was not viewable on our DVD player.SO, my advice is to read the whole red print."
2,One side of the DVD doesn't play,"I received this DVD on time as promised, however, the widescreen side of the disc doesn't play at the end. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
3,Not too bad,"I only watched this movie because my wife said she'd watch all 3 Naked Gun movies only if I would watch Birdcage. Simply put, this was not a movie I ever had a desire to see.Now, I like Robin Williams. He can make me laugh like few other actors. And, he does just that in this movie. His part is hilarious.The part of his partner (Victor), was borderline nausiating. I kept an open mind with the whole gay issue, but Victor went a little above and beyond. As does the houseboy.Gene Hackman as a straight-laced senator gives a great performance. Make sure you keep an eye on him at the end of the movie. He steals the scene.Other than that, I give it 3-stars because Williams and Hackman hold it all together."
2,Better than popeye the sailor,"Robin Williams is a talented guy, can do comedy and serious. This is not one for the family. The general theme here has been done better elsewhere. This is a 3 star -GOOD- movie, but I dropped it 1 star for the family friendliness factor."
5,"Fosse, Fosse, Fosse, Martha Graham, Martha Graham!","This movie is practically perfect in every way! By turns riotously funny and endearingly touching, this movie illustrates in a very lighthearted way that true love comes in many forms. (In fact, I consider the scene on the bench with Armand and Albert to be one of the most truly romantic scenes captured in modern film. Forget those phony sex scenes with airbrushed stars that you see in most of today's films -- Armand and Albert's interactions capture the heart of real tenderness in a long-term relationship!) Oh, yes, and did I mention it was funny? My husband and I have watched it at least 20 times and know every line, but we end up watching it again and again because it's just that good! If you're a hardcore ""red stater"", this movie may not be your thing, but for everyone else...buy it!!!"
1,Boooooring...,"I can't believe this movie is so well known. I guess it all has to do with the subject matter and not the movie. People think, ""Wow, drag queens, it must be funny."" I don't think I laughed more than twice during the entire ordeal. When this movie wasn't boring it was sentimental. Robin Williams does his usual mugging one moment and cries the next. I hated the character of the selfish, bossy son and the way everyone bends to his every whim. I can understand the character of Albert being a little whiny and needy but he was just overdone by Nathan Lane. The whole thing was just too stereotypical to me. It could have used a little slapstick or some TRUE absurdity. There are much better mistaken identity type films out there."
1,The Bird Has Flown,"This film isn't a patch on the original French film. Blanded out for U.S. audiences as usual, and Robin Williams totally miscast and allowed to run riot doing his signature schtick. Leave it alone and watch the original with the subtitles."
1,"Love the lifestyle, hated the movie",This politically correct movie is painful to watch because it's so much on it's target. I laughed until I cried from all the badly done jokes. Williams does such a splendid job in this picture that I started to wonder about him. Other actors didn't perform as well as Williams or the Birdcage. This movie is good to watch when you listen to the Village People.
5,"i, i ,,, i don't understand... PURE GENIUS!","I love this movie so much, such great comedy interwoven into a hysterical/ wild plot. Such a great movie, i recomend it for anyone who needs a laugh!"
4,The Birdcage should have better video quality,"I absolutely love both movies, but the reason this is not getting 5 stars is because the Birdcage looks like crap. I was hoping they would have converted it to a higher resolution, but imagine my surprise when I went to play it on my computer and it came up with a 600x800 resolution box. I put it in my blu-ray player and it was grainy. I understand the quality of La Cage, but seriously... The Birdcage was made in the 1990's, the quality should be there."
5,great movie,I would recommend this to anyone who loves old movies and loves Robin Williams. Easy to make this purchase. yea
5,a classic,This is one of the best movies ever! Entertaining time after time. An Oscar worthy performance given by Hank Azaria.
5,"Bird, Bird, Who's got the Bird ?","This is the best of the""La Cage "" films. The French versions are interesting but not nearly as comical as Williams and Lane. If you have viewed La Cage a Folle's 1 &2, you have missed the best, If you have the ""Birdcage"" you can forget the rest."
2,Way to easy,It takes no time for my kids 3 & 5 to figure out which eye doesn't have the frog on it so next thing you know one kid is zooming around the lilly pads while the other sits in boredom. Read the directions many times and there is just no way around it it's way to easy to remember which eye is blank. We have Pengaloo and that game is way more fun because the Penguins are all the same that cover the colored eggs so you must really pay attention. With Froggy Boogie once a child checks an eye if they do not put it back exactly right you know thats the eye with the frog or blank. Another Great game is Curious George get that one instead.
4,southern songwriter with strong voice,"Jennifer Daniles is a brilliant singer songwriter with strong influences in the Celtic and folk traditions. her singing voice moves from soft and lilting to strong and empowering. anyone looking for quality ""rootsy"" music with strong melodies and insightful lyrics should look no further. the one drawback to this CD compared to her previous ""Dive and Fly"" is the musical arrangements focus more on the electric guitar rather than the more atmospheric and textured acoustic arrangments of her earlier records. so while the songs are all beautiful, they can be at times lacking in intimacy"
5,Beautiful princess dress,This dress is very pretty and looks beautiful on my daughter. She looks like a real princess. Would purchase from this trader again.
2,Amazing playing but,"Glenn Gould has mastered the Bach, Goldberg Variations with out a question of doubt. His playing and style is absolutely amazing. The part that spoils the whole thing for me is when he starts humming. If you listen to it with the head phones on you can hear him humming away in the back ground. It is such a shame as he spoils his own brilliant performance."
3,Funny in a very heartwarming way,Richard Pryor is at his best as he drives a group of kids across country in an old school bus. It starts out as a punishment but he gets taken in by the kids and their problems.
2,I don't know what happen to them.,"I really, REALLY like Saxon, but this album is in my opinion just bad. There's no ""punch"" in the performances. If I knew I would listen to it a couple of times and forget it forever in one of my drawers, I wouldn't have bought it. Listen to Crusader and Power&Glory. After that, see if you can stand listening to this one. There is no way."
2,Saxon can do much better than this,"It's a mystery to me how anyone can give this album 5 stars! But since that clearly can be done, I just wonder how many stars are you handing out to ""Denim and leather"" and ""Strong arm of the law""?""Forever free"" is a mediocre Saxon album comparable with ""Solid ball of rock"""". It's not as radio oriented as some of their other albums (when Saxon tried to break into the American market) but it's far from the heights shown on the masterpiece ""Denim and leather"" or the more recent and excellent ""Unleash the beast"". On this album, you'll find a couple of good songs, especially ""Forever free"", but you'll also get to hear a lot of average tunes. The production is rather bad (at least on my not remastered copy). Although I like the fact that Biff and his gang refuse to give up, I can't give this release anything higher than 2 stars."
5,IT WORKS...what more do you need?,"I found the original book, Pigpen to Paradise, shortly after my husband was injured. I had three teenage boys at home and was working two jobs. This paperback book made my life easier to handle by tackling the hardest part to get in order.At this time, I have my third copy of the Pigpen to Paradise book, because I keep loaning it out and it never comes back home!Thank you so much, Pam and Peggy."
3,"Entertaining, outdated, but somewhat helpful","I just read this book and enjoyed it. It was entertaining, but somewhat outdated. The basis of their program is good. In fact, the detailed listing of household duties is helpful in putting together a personal program - using your computer. They did, later, insert some information about using your computer, but it is still outdated. I followed the recommendation someone else gave and purchased the book ""Sink Reflections""."
5,LOVE these pants,"I own 2 pairs of these pants. I wear them all the time, very versatile. They are everyday around the house pants or working in the garden, or hiking, or casual work day pants. Great addition to any active girls wardrobe. Buy them now. Prana makes quality clothes, tough and durable."
1,A Pityful Mind,"This 'dive' into pseudo intellectualism is a poor attempt to compliment the works of Wittgenstein, Kripke, and other Metaphysical scholars. Mr. Woodard's often obscure, and always inane analogies leave the reader confused and stupider for having read his novel. I recommend this piece of literature only to those with the feeblest of minds; or to those who enjoy masochism. Who published this garbage?"
1,this movie was... weak..... it sucked... dont buy ut,the plot was????? the movie looked like it was recorded with a handy cam... the volume was suspect... the whole movie was dumb...
5,"So magic, so serene, so Jennifer Berezan","As I said for reTurnig, this CD is just beyond words, you must hear it complete, it's soothing, it's calm, it's joyful, it's healing, it's serene, it's so beautiful, it's addictive-hypnotic, it's marvelous and uplifting, is like being surrounded by your mother's arms.So hypnotic, so addictive, so moving, so GREAT, God I love this woman voice and workAbsolutely 10/10If you like the good music you must have this CD""This CD is an invitation to open our hearts to the beauty of this amazing world and to sing, dance and work together for its healing. All the guests sang, played and spoke from the heart. In unique, authentic and profound ways they expressed healing, devotion and wonder for this beautiful and troubled world...But the holiest words I've ever read or thought or sung or prayedWere praises, praises for the world"""
2,Face cream,Very disappointed. Left my face greasy & I don't have oily skin. Couldn't return so out of the money. Its not inexpensive either.
5,Definitely a MUST read and then re-read!,"Like everyone else I was first exposed to this book in the early 80's. I wore my first copy out and then never got my second copy back and my third sits on my brother-in-laws shelf as he won't return it. I was able to get a (what I believe a REALLY rare) hard cover copy that was only for a book club, which I have just started reading again. If you get a chance to read this book, DO NOT PASS IT UP! The mystique of everything to do with this book and author only adds to the greatness. I only wish Mr Sailor would write again, maybe even try to keep up with my co-favorite author Clive Cussler."
3,"Way overpriced, but does the job.","In my business, you don't cut corners, which explains why I purchased this grossly overpriced 5v AC adapter. It is what the manufacturer specifies upon pain of invalidating your warranty on their ADVC-110 converter, so I bought it.It is nothing more than a 5v 3 amp AC adapter with an included and entirely unnecessary Firewire cable.That said, it performs as expected, but if you don't have to play by the rule book, you can find many other less expensive alternatives.Canopus makes excellent products, but overcharging its customers for something like this does not reflect well on the company.Jerry"
5,Good book for the times,"With the economy having a great deal more hamburger being brought to the family table, this book fills the bill for adding a great varity of hamburger meals. Time proven and timeless recipes. These times of ours are no longer an age of good grilled steak and baked potato every night, and for those who can still afford $4.00/lb hamburger, this book is the roadmap to some pretty good meals!!"
4,Love it!,This screen works very well. There is some washing out if the room isn't completely dark but for the money it is a great buy. Still haven't figured out how to adjust the stop position yet. I think we need to take the screen off the wall to find the adjustment access.We like the feature that raises and lowers the screen when the projector is turned on and off. We would recommend it.
5,Glory,"I must have read a review of this book in a newspaper as I reserved it from the library. And I'm so glad I didn't miss that week's review.There are so few books that are truly brilliant. And this is one. The writing is poetic. Ms. Wiggins' use of language is wonderful. And her storyline is unforgettable.This is a remarkable book. One that I will now purchase to share with friends. My only regret is the ending. Whenever I find a book such as this I never want it to end. And when it does the ending is a let down. In this case not because the ending is unrealistic, or seemingly cut short. In this case, because I just wanted more and more and more.And I would ask you not to read the cover, not to read to much about this book. It's better to let the author unfold word by word, page by page."
4,A little too tight for .177,"I've bought two of these products for .22 and .177 air gun rifles. The .22 version has coiled brush close to the middle. Both of them are good products and I personally find them very effective. Though I sometimes have a little doubt about pulling string being too thin.Also, .177 version proved to be quite a tight fit for my rifle. It does clean good, but leaves me worried if pulling too hard will break the pulling string. Other than that no complains."
3,"simple, effective","this is a simple product that works as stated, just like you would find anywhere else, except 20-30% more expensive than at a local sporting goods store."
3,"Very tight fit, use caution","I'm a big believer in the BoreSnake, as I use them on my shotguns often. However, there is potential for serious heartache when using a boresnake this small. The fit is very tight on my .17cal rifle(VERY tight)and the snake can not be pulled through the barrel without being wrapped around a screwdriver handle or other such device. I have read in several places on the Internet of people pulling hard enough to break the thin cord, leaving the boresnake stuck midway in the barrel. So far, the only person that was able to get it out ended up sending the barrel to a gunsmith that had to fire it in a kiln to burn out the boresnake.I would say that the .17cal boresnake has potential to ruin your day, but the boresnake I use for my 20ga shotgun I wouldn't trade for anything."
5,Great Product,I recently purchased this boresnake and it has revolutionized the way I clean my rifle and handgun. It has simplified the process and made what use to be a chore into an enjoyable experience. I will say the first time you use it the boresnake is a bit stiff. You will need to put some muscle behind it if you are trying to fit it through a .22lr caliber barrel. Other than that it's great!
1,DISAPPOINTED .17 HMR boresnake,"Bought the .17 HMR bore snake and it would not even fit into the barrel. Total waste of $16.00 and shipping. I have bore snakes in .223 and .308 that I really like alot and are great products, but the one I got for my .17 will not even fit into the barrel.Brandon"
5,A must addition to your cleaning kit.,A must addition to your cleaning kit. This is all I use to clean the bore after a trip to the range. Also I always buy the rifle length versions. You can use them in your pistols as well.
3,Not for PCP's...,I ordered 1 and it won't fit any PCP rifle because the brass weight is too long and can't go in the chamber.
5,Never disappointed with a Hoppe's bore snake,"Everyone should have one of Hoppe's bore snakes for every long gun they own. IMHO, it is a piece of gear that is as essential as ammo. Period. Why? Because the risk of damaging a rifle bore, chamber or extractor is greatly reduced by using a boresnake over a cleaning rod and far easier to ""pack out""."
3,meh,"cheesy romance novel version of the Camelot tale. a bit sluggish at times and a number of eye roll moments. overall, meh."
2,afraid my quest for a good movie about Camelot goes on....,"because here is another clunker. Richard Gere is just awful as Lancelot. You know, the legendary Lancelot is a NOBLEMAN, not a street performer. He is FRENCH, not...well...American like Gere. These legends have stood the test of time because they are good, just as they are. They don't need to be updated--you ruin what they're all supposed to be about that way. I like Sean Connery, but isn't he a little long in the tooth to play Arthur? He might be a better age for Merlin. Nope, this is not my kind of Camelot."
2,"Lots of people loved it, not me...","While I've always sort of cast Sean Connery as the epitome of King Richard the Lionheart, Richard Gere spelled a death knell for this movie in my book. Sure, he is handsome, strong, skilled, confident, and the talk of all the ladies, but it's just too bad that he knows it and isn't afraid to say so and act like it (in all of his films).I was really put off by the way he expects women to melt (and more) in his presence. Besides, his teeth are way to straight to be a convincing anybody in medieval times.Sorry, but this story of Richard, his queen and first knight misses the mark for me"
1,"Wretched movie, cute girl.","One of those wretched wastes of film that portray an unrealistic story based *very* loosely on a classic. They might as well have thrown Kevin Costner in there to add insult to injury. This movie took so many liberties that it made the story generic and unappealing to me. It was so weak and watered down that it wouldn't have made much difference if Arthur was played by Sean PENN instead of Sean Connery! Buy ""Excalibur"" instead."
1,Just Plain Bad,"This is one of the most historically inaccurate movies I have ever seen. It is certainly the worst King Arthur movie that I have seen. I can not believe how bad this film is. King Arthur was a fairly young to middle age guy, but Sean Connery is in his 70's and looks like it too. The other Knights of the Round Table were also about the same age as King Arthur, but in this movie theyare of wildly different ages. The acting is generally poor with several of the actors being just plain wooden. The script is pretty bad too.One of the worst aspects of this movie is the costumes and acting. All of the clothes look brand new and there are a number of instances where clothes that get dirty in a battle suddenly and mysteriously get clean again even though the characters are still on the battlefield. Evidently the actors could not stand wearing dirty clothing. Back in the days of King Arthur, knights wore chain mail instead of plated armor.The final word: avoid this flick at all costs."
1,"Bad movie, worse DVD","This movie was an insult to the Arthur legend. I knew that in the theatre. But then my girlfriend bought the DVD (she loved the movie) and I sat down to watch it again.It was worse the second time through! At least the first time I got into the costumes and stuff. But this time, even Sean Connery was bad. This film was worse than Dragonheart.And as a DVD? Useless waste of a 10 cent disc. ""Bonus"" materials? None. And the improved picture and sound quality do nothing to make the movie any better."
5,Swash and Buckle,"Yo, fellow yeopeople. (Must be PC, don't you know!) To sword, to lance, to horse, to buy. Ayup, add this to your collection of SB's. Well worth the placing on your shelves and watching any old time. If for no other reason than to fill out your Sean Conner collection. Do it, buy it. If you don't like it, give it to your library. They can always use good stuff. But, be good to yourself and get it.....cheers"
1,"A miserable, mis-spent two hours of my life","Notes from the pre-production team of FIRST KNIGHT:""Re: The medieval and modern literary texts of the legend of King Arthur""Frank, thanks for sending me all these books about King Arthur, but I really can't use them. I'm too busy trying to cast Richard gere, and I really can't be bothered to read them. Besides, some of them aren't even in, like, real English! It's all old and stuff.""I've got the script all done. You'll really like it, I think. I lifted it from a cheesy romance novel I read once, but that's okay, I don't think anyone'll notice. It's a lot more interesting than these old timeless literary texts.""P.S.: Who's this Thomas Malory guy, anyway? I've never seen him on the bestsellers list ... ""sigh!"
3,Solid Pucho,"This studio recording was done in LA when Pucho was on tour. Several selections are excellent: Happy Feet Mambo, Lena's Mood, Descarga Las Palmas. The only obvious filler here is Copacabana."
2,Worst of the series,"Ms. Shayne begins the book by thanking someone for encouraging this novel. But in truth, Ms. Shayne should smack that person.The novel begins with the main character finding Dante's diaries and believing they are works of fiction. She revises these novels into screenplays and eventually makes blockbuster movies.The story is much longer than I have defined and has winning moments but it is plagued with trying to do too much. Ms. Shayne was obviously trying to create another series from this novel and so there are more charcters than probably need to be. There is too little character development of the 'right'charcters, main characters, and too much development of sub-characters.If you are a loyal fan of this genre you might enjoy this book.If you are a fan of Ms. Shayne, as I am, you will probably be a little disappointed."
5,INCREDIBLE,"This movie is friggin amazing, it may seem slow at first but I assure you it definatly is not, and it pays off so well, the music with every fight scene is different every time and makes it all the sweeter. It wasn't extremely popular in theaters, but if you see it trust me you will be saying that too (why wasn't it?). This has quickly become one of the best and one of my most favorite movies I have ever seen and gotten."
1,Catering to our animal instincts,"I know that everyone loves the Boondock Saints, but I think it is a terrible movie which exposes our dark, retributive instincts, glorifying vigilante justice. Are we still so primal that we relish the though of eye for an eye, patting our stomachs at having been satiated by a vindictive shooting spree? Do we like this story because it lets us live out our fantasies of having the power to exact revenge from our transgressors? I think the popularity of this movie shows that we still have a good deal of growing up to do.Message aside, I also think this is one of Dafoe's least impressive films, although I realize that many people disagree. I would not recommend it."
1,one star because of the cat killing!,"The outrageous, nauseatingly graphic, gratuitous, obscene etc. killing of the cat in this movie was pointless and as far from being funny as anything could be.Because of this - the five stars that would have been given - are reduced to send a very important message."
1,Horribly overrated,"As another reviewer put it, this is one of those movies that is unintentionally funny. The acting is awful and the plot nonsensical. I originally got it because of all its rave reviews here, of which I no longer trust. This one has all the acting and plot of a late-night straight-to-TV flick. I had a hard time making it all the way through. This one is a real stinker, if you want Boston-style mob violence save yourself the trouble and watch the horribly depressing (but much, much better) The Departed instead."
5,"Great Campy, Dark-Humored Fun","This movie is not for everyone. If you liked ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" and ""Sin City,"" however, then there is a chance to will enjoy ""Boondock Saints."" Like ""Sin City,"" the story plays more like a graphic novel than a typical movie. Even the camera angles made me think of some classic graphic novels. Unlike ""Sin City"", however, ""Boondock"" is not based on any graphic novel of which I am aware. Still, the look, the characters, and the plot give it that feel. Everything's a little over the top, all the time. It's all great fun actually.As others have stated already, Willem Defoe, does a great job as the gay FBI agent, but all the actors do a good job with some very tongue-in check sort of characters. As I said before, if you are partial to the black humor genre, I think you'll really enjoy this."
1,Garbage,This movie is a stinker. Just awful. I'd be embarrased to be involved with this movie. Willem Dafoe is too good for this derivative nonsense. He should remove his name from the credits.
1,DONT GET FOXED,"If you think of buying this, this is a fantastic movie! But if you are from Europe beware, than FOX will fox you.This fox will cheat you, because this Company is the only one in the State, who will not let you see your movie,because of code two for blu-ray. NO OTHER COMPANY will do this to you. I hate FOX !"
2,Tarentino Lite,"This film is an obvious Tarentino-wannabe, which tries to be ""hip"" but fails miserably...from the corny attempts at humor (which more often than not are composed of outdated, groan-inducing ethnic stereotypes) to the completely implausible, hole-riddled ""plot"". A movie which has been done many times before with much better results, ""Boondock Saints"" deserves a miss. Its only redeeming quality is...wait, there are none, I should've given it one star. Trash."
1,Really strange...,"Maybe I watched a wrong version of this movie, but I could not see any of the great things all the people are talking about.The story of the movie is quite boring. Two irish boys taking the law into their own hands and shootimg some mafia, or other bad guys. One FBI agent is hunting them, and realizes that he thinks these guys are some kind of cool...Okay, can be that this story could be interesting if it would not have set in scene in such a bad way. You see stereotypes all the time! The bad guys are kind of stupid and the ""good"" guys are clever and lucky. Sound like a fairy tale. I guess it is.However, I don't want to lose too many words about this film since it stole enough of my time. Just wanted to warn you. I read all these could critics and though this could be a good movie. I really tried to find something good, but it was too hard!"
4,Release date of 12/18/01,"The Boondock Saints is a really good movie. I think that Willem Dafoe was not up to his usual great self (see Platoon, The Last Temptation Of Christ, Shadow Of The Vampire, etc.). His acting was a little too over-the-top for my liking. However, everything else about this movie is great! The brothers were perfect, and the supporting cast played their parts well. The action was hypnotic, and the dialogue is some of the best for the genre. If not for Willem's excess, I might've given the film a 5."
5,BOONiffic,I work at blockbuster video and i've seen everything. I've recommended this flick to about a jillion people and all have come back with only good things to say. Definitely one of my favorite movies.
4,TAKE IT HOW YOU WANT IT,This movie has such a following that most people wouldnt know why yes this is controversial yes this is overthe top bit vigilatsism is over the top the performances were craving and somewhat funny as the sean patrick flanery accent was dead on a as for reedus bare with me he looked like he was talking jibbirish i liked how some scenes were put toghther very thought of but the editing was bad in this film although this movie is a good flick and has its agenda telling people to fight for a good cause the ending would say it all all i got to say is its yours to choose either you like it or hate it as for me its was a good film but i cANunderstand why people would take offense to this just relax its entertainment folksCRITICS CHOICE: 6/10 FOR ACTING5/10 FOR THE WRITING8/10 FOR SCENE GRABBERS8.5/10 FOR OVERALL
5,Awesome Movie,"You HAVE to laugh the boondock saints. They are cool kick butt guys that make a great team. Great action, and there's even comedy thrown in."
4,Classic,I go through soo many emotions when I watch this movie happiness anger sadness. I cry soo much when Rocko dies *spoilers
5,Fantastic Movie,This is a fantastic movie. It has it all. I would highly recommend getting this movie.Anyone who loves action movies then this is for you.
2,"OK to rent, but wouldn't buy it","The directing and acting are both enjoyable, and I agree with other reviewers who say that, despite being a movie about vigilantism there are quite a few funny and tongue-in-cheek character moments. Having said that, while the style of the movie is attractive, there's not much substance behind it. I see a storyline that subordinates itself to the characters from the outset, and because of a lack of character development, a principal tenet of the story- the morality of vigilantism- becomes an unanswered cliche. (As an example, compare this movie with Dirty Harry in ""Magnum Force,"" a less stylized but more substantive movie.)As an aside, while watching this movie I was reminded of ""The Town,"" because of the Boston/Irish connections, and this was interesting.In short, knowing what I know now, I might rent this movie once for fun, but I wouldn't buy it because I don't think I'll watch it again."
3,It is what it is,"This movie was suggested by someone who knew I loved B-movies. It sounded interesting, and when I saw Defoe was in it, I gave it a shot. I can't see the 5 star ratings some people give it, nor the 1 star ratings. The movie is what it is, a pretty good B-film. Original, not really. Stylish, some what. Great, no. Awful, no. The flash forward, flash backward technique isn't new, but well used. The violence is a little over the top, but so are other films. Don't expect The Godfather, but it's not Ishtar either."
2,More style than substance,"I expected more...The acting is good. But the scenarios are so implausible, and the director is trying oh so hard to make another Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that it was hard to watch this film.My recommendation: see a Guy Ritchie or Tarantino film (again). And if you must see this film, rent it. So that you can be rid of it in 5 days."
1,more plot holes than bullet holes,"Everyone I talk to likes this movie, but I'm here to tell you that this movie is terrible. The plot is terrible. The characters are way out there - for example the guy that plays the best friend side kick is this zany, hyper-spaz who is juxtaposed with the two Irish guys and drags them down. And then there's the overtly gay Wilem Defoe who portays a gay FBI agent to stereotype-accuracy. The characters ... and the worst is probably the leather trenchcoat wearing long-lost father who emerges to join this circus train. There's more plot holes than bullet holes in this train wreck. Don't waste your time and don't let people sucker you into watching this film."
1,Truly awful,"I can only assume that the director (watch the far superior Overnight if you'd like to meet him) has enlisted his friends and family to plaster the internet with reviews for this film. It's rated well on here, well on iTunes, but -tellingly - it's rated horribly on Rotten Tomatoes. I hardly ever switch off films before they end. You've paid your money, right? But this was one exception. An execrable film: amateurish, pretentious, and trying so hard to be cool, it's agonizing. Don't say you haven't been warned."
5,Boondock Saints DVD,"This is one of the tightest movies I have ever seen. I give it a definate 5 star rating. Boondock Saints is not filled with gaudy SFX or anything, just a solid story with some tight shoot-outs. Not only is there action, but it's extremely funny too. If you haven't seen this movie see it....NOW!"
5,The Greatest!,"Dude!...My sister's b/f brought over some dvds and one of em was The Boondock Saints. After a couple of dvds we watched this one. This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen...It has everything in it....Suspense..Comedy..Non-stop Action..I definately recommend this movie to ppl who like movies like Snatch and Lock,Stock,and two barrels smoking....Buy it don't rent it either...Your gonna wanna watch this one over and over!"
3,An excellent product except:,"The costume was everything I expected. Absolutely beautiful. The problem was that before I got to the party, the buttons on the cape and the chain that holds the cape on came off. I spent the whole night trying to hold the cape on. Not a good evening."
5,"Where have you ""girls"" been all my life?","I bought this CD in the bargain bin at a mall music store and didn't expect much. It blew me away! I have played it over and over. I can't get enough of the smooth, sweet voices of Audrey Morris and Paula Castle.For the greatest jazz vocals this side of heaven, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed. There are two uncut albums on this CD, both recorded in 1956 and 57. Paula only recorded eight songs in her career and they are all here. Both of these ladies have voices any jazz singer of today would kill for.So order this CD, relax in your most comfortable chair, close your eyes, and pretend that you are in a smoky jazz bar of the Fifties. This is the real deal."
2,NUNSENSICAL,"The trailer for this movie is probably better than the whole film. Stuffed with oodles of atmosphere and some unique and spooky effects, the movie fails due to its frenzied plot, mediocre acting and a soundtrack that often overshadows the dialogue. Some of the accents also make it difficult to understand. The movie's twist ending is also rather forced, and it negates the basic plot of the film. Lions Gate needs to be more selective in the films it finances."
5,Review of Indian Crafts and Lore,"I have had this book since I was a child. The drawings are well researched and presented. The instructions for the craft projects are not what a Indian would do to put together the items presented. However, it is and excellent starting place for young people just getting started in Native American Craft work."
4,Miss John Crawford,"Yes, I was at the record store at the release date to pick up Voyeur. Is it better than ""Count 3 and Pray"", yes. Better than ""Love Life"", no. I certainly miss John Crawford's (Wrote almost all of the bands music) presence in the band.The music is still tight, I just feel something is missing. Ms. Nunn's looks great and sounds awesome (But can't seem to shake the title of a poor man Deborah Harry....ala Dale Bozzio (Missing Persons)).Should you buy it..........YES!Is it as amazing as ""Pleasure Victim"" and ""Love Life"", no."
2,Great router but......,"If this router had been working properly when it was bought used, it would have worked great, but it didn't work like it should have. I think I just got a bad one."
1,2nd router failure,i got this router twice it works great but both the times there is a hardware failure. i need to ship it back to dlink to get a replacement. Hope i get one that lasts for a while.
1,What a piece of crap,"Man, this router sucks. It works properly as an 802.11g configuration but not N. It's slow and it crashes all the time. I'll be sitting on my computer and suddenly I have to walk over to it and reset it because I have no internet connection, then wait two minutes for it to reboot. Usually twice a day or more. Even as I write this, I'm afraid my connection will go out on me. Yes I updated to the latest firmware, but it still doesn't work for me. Don't waste your money, keep looking for something that gets decent reviews."
4,What a journey!!!,"Until 2-3 weeks ago, I was very frustrated with this router. I purchased it from a retail store in June after my previous DLink (624) had completely failed. From that point on, I'd suffered from continuous connectivity loss. Our connection to DSL would stay up for 5 minutes - to 3 days (MAX). On a daily basis, I was restarting the DSL modem or router or both. I'd gotten to the point of purchasing another modem myself (ISP wouldn't help from their side) just to prove the DSL modem. Finally, I called DLink customer support and was told of the firmware update 1.1 [...].Installing this firmware update (for rev A routers only) has completely cleared my issues. Now the router performs as it should have the entire time. One bounce that cleared on its own since the firmware upgrade. Please do yourself the favor of upgrading ASAP upon use of this router!Of course, it sure would have been nice to have this severity of quirkiness ironed out before final product distribution, but..."
1,This router sucks,"I bought this router and upgraded to latest firmware. It worked like a charm for 3 days. After that connection keeps droping for both wired and wireless every 2-3 hours. The logs are not helpful, samething about dlink customer support. I am only using Dlink router and Dlink Network card. I have FIOS as soon as switch to another router everything is fine. The configurations are also anoying if you have to change you have to wait 20 secs."
4,good choice for home use,"I bought this router on the advice of a relative who has a home business. It works wonderfully, and I get great reception for my laptop on a different floor. The only problem I have, which may be the router, or could be AOL, is that every so often, I have to do a connective fix before I can use AOL for the internet. Otherwise, it was a great price for the quality of the product."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK,"D-Link router sort of worked for awhile; I would have to reset it once a week or more, then finally quit altogether. Tech support doesnt exist and boy you better not lose your receipt if you'd like them to tell you even the time of day. I'll NEVER buy another dlink ""product"" ever."
3,"Product OK, Support Awful","I had a lot of trouble connecting this device and getting it working. I was lucky enough to get a wonderful HP rep who was willing to help me out. Once I got it connected, it has been working fairly well but during the set up process I contacted dLink for help and I got none. They were rude and totally impatient. And it wasn't just a fluke. I tried calling them several times (because the set up got really screwed up and I had to restore my laptop of 2 years to original factory condition) and I got the same treatment from every rep I talked to. I finally gave up on getting any assistance from them. Customer service may not be important to everyone but I consider it very important and dLink gets about 0 stars from me on that side."
4,Needed Customer service,"After a day of frustration with configuration, I called the customer service number, and was up and running. I have had this unit for 3 weeks, and am really pleased. I have not yet used the N technology."
1,Better router on paper...,"Worst router ever. Hands down. First the software isnt compatible with Mac post Tiger OS apparently, second, this router is a pain to set up. I spend almost an hour setting it up. Once this thing was up, my speeds tanked from 35 ms ping, 10-15 megs download, and 3-5 megs upload to 115 ms ping, .45 megs download, and .94 upload. This router is disgraceful and a waste of time and effort. Avoid at all cost, this router is a waste of money."
4,Solid performing router,"I have had this router for 4 months and it performs solidly. The wireless signal can be wacky andf drop off periodically but I hardly use the wireless. I have had good luck with D-Link products. It was super easy to set up. I use it for my desktop computer, Vonage, TiVo, and laptop."
4,just so so,"The speed is really horrialbe: maxmun is 50Mb/s, average is 10Mb/s. But, the signal is very good."
1,Time you will never recover,"After comparing the instructions with the pictures, I finally lucked out and struck pay dirt. It worked after programing it fifty times. A real problem with the software. You get what you pay for."
2,Don't buy it if you need help,Delivery was OK. Couldn't get to work with my computer. Tech support was from some foreign place and tech could hardly speak English. Repeatedly ask her to speak slower so I could understand her to no avail. Finally gave up and returned router. Now have a netgear that works fine.
1,Even their own techs couldn't make it work...,"Perhaps the worst computer product I've ever owned. Spent nearly four hours with a D-Link tech, a tech from my ISP and a tech from my satellite provider. None of them could get this thing to connect to my modem despite trying every imaginable configuration.Took it back to the store where I purchased it and traded it for an older and cheaper Linksys Wireles-G router that was up and running in 15 minutes.Normally I like D-Link products, but this one is junk. Avoid this router like the plague."
4,D-Link 615,D-Link 615 router came quickly and it is doing its' job well. I have it hooked upto a broadband WAN connection. The first LAN connection goes to a wired desktop while the 2nd LAN connection connects to a wireless bridge which sends the signal to our house about 450' from the router's location in a office building. This router has handled these connections well and the setup was easy. The wireless works also though we have only tried it once with an I-touch. Pleased so far with this product.
1,Wireless? WHAT Wireless?!,"Okay, I took this out of the box, tried WPA2, no go, WEP, no go, WIDE OPEN NO SECURITY, no go. Would not connect to ANY wireless adapter or notebook computer no matter what I did. Wired works fine but I wanted a wireless router. Past the 30 days return time so can't send it back to Amazon, forget D-Link they won't even talk to me. Really disappointed in this thing."
5,Works fine.,"Works fine for my basic use.I have a home PC plugged in directly to the port and another laptop that uses the wireless.Setup was easy (I did not use the D-Link install CD) and my laptop found it on the first try.So, it is well priced and no problems for my basic set up.(I previously was using a D-Link ""b"" rated wireless router from 2003 and that power supply died last month.)"
1,Works OK,"So, I went down to fry's yesterday to buy a router. I'd never had one before, so this is all kind of new to me. (The wireless connection I used to leech dropped out). Set up was kind of a hassle, I would say if you know anything about anything, don't use their wizards, do it manually. Wireless N works fine. My only problem, the antennas are TERRIBLE. T E R R I B L E. And there's no way to replace them. My house is 1200 square feet (albeit with a lot of walls in it) and I get zero bars with signal to no signal at all at the far end of the house. Anything larger, i would go for something a bit more expensive. I'm using Version C1, with firmware 3.011/23/09 I've recently finally replaced this thing, and the improvement is out of this world. To clarify, this thing maxed out at about 30 feet. 30 feet. i get the feeling I got a defective product, but this wasn't even funny."
5,Recommend,I bought this router because my sister needed one and bought this one so I did too. It does the job and was relatively inexpensive. I recommend it.
5,Excellent For the Price!,"This is a terrific router for the price. Initial firmware flashing was iffy, but after a restart its been running with zero problems and zero networking drops. A terrifically great upgrade/replacement for my Linksys."
1,This one Sucks!!,"Took my son a few hours to set this router up. This junk router then worked 4 hours. Call tech support Monday AM. After the 50 questions and it all being my fault, I was instructed to return it to the store. This experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, I am still looking for router worth the money."
5,"Great Router, Easy Set-Up","Despite the many neutral to negative reviews, I'm having a very positive experience with this router. It was easy to set-up and install (I didn't have to use the install CD). I recommend using the install CD if you're unfamiliar with basic networking. I'm not by any means a network genius.My favorite features was the automatic recognition of my SlingBox Pro and XBOX 360. On my previous router (Actiontec) I had to find tutorials by the manufacturers in order to manually input the correct port forwarding settings. This DLink automatically recognized and I'm guessing set the correct port forwarding information because both work perfectly.For $39.99 (Amazon.com, Circuit City as of 8/24/08) this N router is a steal!So far so good, the only thing I'll be concerned about is the quality - some previous reviewers mentioned that it worked, but then it broke...Overall, highly recommended."
3,Not Bad for the price,I bought this router as my old linksys 54gc router got bricked after firmware update. The range on this router is better than the old router I had. The setup CD that came with the product had some issues setting up the wireless network and I had to pop out and pop in the cd couple of times to get the setup wizard working.My laptop sometimes takes unusually long time to acquire network address using this router. Apart from these issues the router is working well.
1,Not worth it.,"I guess you do get what you pay for. A wireless N router for $49.99, great deal, right? WRONG. This thing is garbage. After calls to support and reading up on it I have Rev A of this router and I cannot speak for Rev B. I lose connectivity, sometimes in the middle of long downloads on the wireless G and also lose connectivity on the wired port. Updating the firmware from D-Links website locked the ting up and required some sequence of holding down the resent pin while unplugging and re-plugging it back in. Now whenever i need to re-boot it to regain connectivity to my modem all the settings are set to default, including the admin password and the wireless network settings.This is getting returned tomorrow."
2,Wireless is intermittently horrible,"I bought the DIR-615 for my main gateway and for an N wireless network. For the most part it works well. The biggest problem is that the wireless connection is horrible. I have a D-Link DAP-1522 that I also bought to connect my downstairs Tivo and Boxee box to the router since there wasn't a way to make a wired connection. I get nowhere near N speeds. In fact, I have done multiple tests with multiple devices (THE DAP-1522, xoom, two different laptops, EVO, etc), and ALL of them get at most 1Mbps where they all consistently hit my 10Gbps cap from my ISP when going through my older wireless G access point. The DIR-615 has a lot of features, and as a router its great. Just don't buy it because it's wireless N."
1,Not better signal strength,I bought this N router to replace a G netgear so I could get better signal strength to a particular location. This N router doesn't get as strong a signal to that desk than the G does. I also bought a Dlink USB MIMO antenna for the laptop I use there and got 6.5 Mbps compared to 11 Mbps from G with built in antenna. N didn't help for this location and Dlink MIMO doesn't work as advertised for me. I will never buy Dlink again. I also had setup problems. I finally had to call tech support to get it working. I did have good tech support from them.
3,Stable once you find the right Channel!,"As others have noted, once you find the right channel, the router runs stable with good speeds. I would try channels 1,6,11 first and then the others if you experience signal dropouts. N runs fine in mixed mode for me.If you're not good with computers or don't like messing with settings, you'd be better off with another router that is easier to set up."
5,excellent value,"I bought this as a black friday cheap upgrade from my old wireless b system and it has been working absolutely great.don't use the cd that comes with the product - somehow that cd did not make any sense when i tried to follow instruction.installation would have been a breeze if I had just followed the 4 step easy set up sheet.Overall, the product is working great, signal has not dropped even once in over a month and I get much better reception throughout my hose."
4,"Works well, easy to setup","I purchased this item 2 months ago to replace my ehome wireless b router and it has improved my internet connection. Whereas before I frequently lost my internet connection (I have a sony laptop and comcast provides the internet service), I have not had that problem with this dlink router. Maybe other routers would be just as good, but this one worked fine. It was simple to set up and started working as soon as I connected it."
2,Works like a charm...when it feels like working,"i liked this router, it was my first, but after 4 months of having it, it kept having such limited access that i had to rename and reset the router daily, always making a new network name for the router. it get's annoying after the 9th time, so i kicked the old thing and got something better. the tech support was helpfull, but they can only help so much, they can't instantly make this hunk of junk perfection in a box. so i'd say it's good for the price, but if you want something that works good and you dont have to buy anything else, spend a few bucks more and get a netgear or cisco router. THOSE are perfection in a box. this is a silly toy."
4,Happy with price and performance,"Jusy went wireless a month ago, so this is my first router. Set up was extremely easy and coverage is good in a two story home. Pleased with the price and the performance."
4,Been working dependably for almost a year now,"I used the free trial of Network Magic to set it up, when the trial expired, it kept disconnecting. I bought the program and all is well. I wonder if that's built into the program....."
5,Fabulous,"Gene Ween is dynamite.There are a few lovely weenish ballots on his album.This is a must have Ween album.I had seen Gene Ween Acoustic Band here is Woodstock, NY and they killed it. I ran out and bought this album immediately."
3,Good- but not up to Ween's greatness,"White Pepper, is a pleasant album. And that's just the point. It doesn't quite hit at the creative highs the other albums hit at. But whatever, good album, probably won't listen to much in the coming years... but I'm sure there are more great Ween to come."
1,S_U_C_K_S A_S_S,"If you're a fan of The Pod, GWS, or Pure Guava, and that's the Ween you know and love, and you've become more and more disappointed with their later work, then I beg of you to close your browser right now, run far, far away, and never look back. This CD isn't worth borrowing, or even downloading. Don't even listen to the samples. It'll ruin your image of a once incredible band. The material on this ""effort"" is mature, well produced, and sensitive (which is fine, but this is Ween for chrissake). Buy another copy of the Pod if you really have to get something. Or if you've never heard it, get Z-Rock Hawaii (also from the Ween brothers). They're releasing another album under that name later this year on Patton's label, Ipecac. More info on that at ween.com. Hope that's at least cool."
3,a disappointing release from the best band on the planet.,"exactly where i'm at, awful song. just plain painful. fluits of chi, even if you don't and bananas and blow are all amazing. stroker ace and ice castles on the other hand are not. back to basum and the grobe are mediocre while pandy fackler is another unlistenable track. but at least the album ends on a three song high note. stay forever, falling out and she's your baby are all wonderful.my suggestion...doenload the good songs. ween is my favorite band but this album is just plain disappointing.check out quebec and pure guava for their best two albums. if you like those get the mollusk and the pod. follow that up with god ween satan and 12 golden country greats. chocolate and cheese and white pepper should follow. white pepper being last.all hail the boognish! keep it brown boys!"
4,Ween Bananas and BLOW,"Ween are back! After the amazing Mollusk I had my hopes up real high for White Pepper. Does W.P. meet my expectations NO, but what possibly can after the Mollusk! Is White Pepper among this years best, absolutely. This record is about the songs and not ""THE ALBUM"" as Mollusk was. ""Even If You Don't"", ""Bananas and Blow"" and ""Back To The Basom"" are among Ween's very best. ""Even If You Don't"" has hit single written all over it and heavily reminds me of Squeeze, MiNsTeR HiLL and XTC...a fantastic pop rock track. ""Bananas and Blow"" is Jimmy Buffet on coke instead of weed. ""Back To The Basom"" is a modern day Floydian. A wonderful release that has me anxiously awaiting their next record."
2,Huh?,"Maybe this book was little too young for me. I just expected more from the author of THE DOLLHOUSE MURDERS, I was sorely disappointed when the plot became immature and pointless. The book starts out exciting enough, when Sarah is forced to move out of her room for her cranky old Aunt. As always, the relationships and character developement are the highlight of Ms. Ren Wright's story, but that alone will not be enough to entertain a reader who wants a ghost story. The plot becomes absurd and unbeliveable evn for a ghost story. In this book, I wasn't very interested in the characters and Ms. Ren Wright seems to hope that the entire book with stand on that alone, but in the the end it cannot. The ending left me saying ""Huh?"" because it was simply pointless. It just seemed like there should be more to it. The already ridiculous plot was resolved far too easily and the ending resolution will leave readers feeling cheated, and disappointed."
2,Not a time saver,"This product eliminated one step. However, the one step took as long to do as two steps."
3,Not sure what to say,So this can be used for many things but what I wanted it for it just didn't work right. I bought this for keeping coffee mixtures together when I blended them with ice and it still came apart and looked nasty. It's def not a seller issue it's the product so I have to find something else that works better.
5,Excellent,This book should be in the hands of everyone that wants to know more about the Bible and is willing to grow in grace and knowledge.
5,Excellent charger,"With the red light off, after about an hour - if you quick charge - the batteries are perfectly charged. Although not an exclusive feature, i do appreciate that when the batteries are charged, even if you're away, the charger will shut off, thus not overheating the batteries."
3,very good,"SAXON finally found its way again since 1997's UNLEASH THE BEAST, their best record in years, much better than previous records. They are mantaining this good moment, with METALHEAD and, now, KILLING GROUND. Even with another line-up change (drummer Nigel Glockler is gone, the band delivered another solid album. But, please, don't believe the reviews that say this is their best album or better than POWER AND THE GLORY, for example. This is simply not true, nor even posible. Time can't come back."
2,Atrac Software Problem,"I really like the hardware I purchased, but the ATRAC software has been nothing but trouble for me. It does not work appropriately and has even crashed my system a couple of times. I would give the hardware 5 stars, but for SONY to issue such cheesy software is well below my usual expectations for their products."
5,"A ""must-have"" for Pavement fans","A friend just got me this as an early Xmas present, and I couldn't be more thankful. I miss Pavement so much it hurts. And this DVD filled a void in me that hasn't been filled in a long time.Included are many many interviews and back story bits about the band, and their evolution..from the beginning up and into the recording of ""Terror Twilight"". Very insightful stuff. Also included are all their videos, which is a nice little bonus, but what's more enjoyable are the myriad of live performances. There's live stuff from here and there, and then there's two full shows here as well.Yes, Pavement's gone. And it sucks big time. But this DVD does help you feel a little better about it."
2,Clear The Bridge,"I'm sure that the content of this book is more than accurate. Most of the book is a very dull read. I doubt that it was a dull life on board. My point is that most of the book is the grinding of daily life, only becomming interesting when action was about to take place. Unfortunately the action was sometimes days in between any action. See a plane, clear the bridge, dive, up scope, plane gone, surface, at least 50 times. I found myself turning pages for the cream of the book. I love history, the author just made it dull. I bought numerous books on submarines, and even had a electronics teacher who helped develope sonar as well as underwater submarine tactics that is still classified to this day. I have nothing but respect for the men who helped in the war effort."
1,Low quality product,"This case is flimsy plastic with thin aluminum edges. Mine came dented, and two of the little rivets had snapped off prior to my using it. Save your money and look somewhere else."
2,We found this very dull,"I played this with our 5 year old and 10 year old. Finding the items seemed way too easy (particularly for them!) and no-one found it challenging. It took only a few rounds before one of the boys said ""Can we play something else?"" and everyone swiftly agreed. I don't think this will be coming out again.It might be a good game for slightly younger children - maybe 3 or 4 year olds?"
5,Crazy Canadian cozy,"The Grub-and-Stakers, a gardening club in small town Ontario, receive a bequest--a house full of stuff, some worthless and some quite nice--to run as a museum. The Aralia Polyphema Architrave Museum, to be exact. But before they can get up and running, someone murders their new curator by pushing him off the roof.Dittany Henbit Monk and her husband, who writes westerns under a pen name, help the local police solve the murder. But first she has to solve an important clue--the bride quilt, embroidered with little multi-colored bees.I really liked this mystery. It is full of eccentric characters and a fun plot, even a little hint of romance. If you like Mary Daheim's bed and breakfast series, you'd probably like this."
3,Still Funny After All These Years,"This is a classic! If you remember the Kennedy White House years, you'll love ""The First Family."" Vaughn Meader, Naomi Brossart, and the other cast voices are splendid, clearly capturing the charm and panache of the Kennedy characters with a brand of style and wit that no one else has ever come close to. What a treat to find this on CD! The technical quality of this reproduction is not what I had hoped for, but that's the only aspect that keeps this otherwise fine piece of memorabilia from earning at least 4 stars."
5,My parents had this one on record!!,My parents actually had the first record of the series and not the second volume. I was so surprised to hear the second album on the second CD I listened to it for the first time! I bought another record album of the first one myself too!! I found Vaughn Meader really funny!!! My parents were big fans of John F. Kennedy when they were in college!!
3,A Warning,"The stories are a mixed bag but well worth a look. All I really want to add to other readers' comments, though, is that the book was poorly proofread -- it is riddled with typos. If as a collector that kind of thing bothers you, you should be aware of this."
1,"Big price, tiny doll",I was very disappointed by this product that is clearly exploiting the popularity of the Angelina books. It was sharp and hard and much too highly priced. My granddaughter forgot about it in a minute.
1,sooo small,the picture of the doll is bigger than the actual thing!!! I thought it was a doll and it was a figurine
2,Does not move,I thought it had posable articulated arms and legs. We were disapoointed with this doll. You should buy a Lolapaloozie instead.
4,Perfect tie but took a while to get here...,"The tie is great, just like the Harry Potter ties in all of the movies but it took a long time to get here. Was received is perfect condition. =)"
1,Upset with seller.,"This is a very handsome tie and I ordered it nearly three weeks ago in order to have it in time for the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows premiere. Unfortunately, it hasn't even been shipped yet. Poor service indeed."
2,Content does not stick to the book title.,"The writing quality is good, but the copy editing is terrible.This book seemed more like a junior SQL book than an introduction to database design."
4,A great introduction to database design!,"Jan Harrington accomplishes her task neatly, to clearly explain relational database design. I was very pleased with how quickly I was able to grasp fundamental concepts and I would recommend this book to anyone getting started with databases. I had hoped that the book would be perfect and would clearly explain every relevant concept but that was not the case. When it came to the three interesting case studies that concluded the book, the author used concepts that were never explained - control-break layout, parent entities, ISAM file organization, repeating groups, reblocking files. While not understanding these concepts did not stop me from grasping the fundamentals of database design it was frustrating and made clear that this is an introductory text and not the last book to read on the subject. There were also about a dozen typos but these were disconcerting rather than misleading."
2,Leave this one on the shelf!,"In a book named ""Clearly Explained"" , you'd expect to have a minimum of confusion. That is not the case with this book.Page(25) for example:""Other many-to-many relationships include that between a child and her biological mother. A woman may have zero, one or more biological daugthers; a daugther has only one biological daughter""Please correct me if I'm wrong but that does not describe a many-to-many relationship. There are other confusing examples in the book (pg 33 for example).I found myself reading sections over and over because the examples were not that clear. Coupled with the errors, I found this book to be less than helpful."
3,Passing was much better,"This book focused entirely too much on two characters. After a while, I got bored with both characters, especially, Lila Calloway. Unlike her first book, Passing, I never learned more about what the characters were all about. Their thought processes, feelings, and reasoning behind their actions lacked depth. Unlike her other book, there was not really a plateau, just a regular story line without many peaks. A decent book for book club discussion, but not necessarily an interesting book for reading ""entertainment""."
2,Was this really necessary?,"Do we really need 2 and a half hours to figure out that the rich lead aimless lives? Shallow message, shallow movie. Not to mention its also boring, although I assume that was the point. Filling a movie with shallow, empty characters and engaging in upper class bashing does not make it a masterpiece, let alone any kind of artistic statement of any worth or insight. Watch ""La Dolce Vita"" to see how this kind of movie should be done."
2,Nothing really happens,"This was the last straw for my husband, who now refuses to watch any more Italian movies with me. The story is that a woman mysteriously disappears while on a yachting trip with friends. Her fiance and her best friend search for her, and begin an affair. The premise may sound as though the film would be suspenseful or emotional, but it isn't. It's slow, meandering, and quite dull. It is perhaps ""realistic"" in that people sometimes behave oddly for no good reason, but this kind of realism isn't necessarily interesting."
3,I love Italian cinema but really!!,"I had heard how wonderful ""L'Avventura"" is and I can sit through Bergman and Fellini and Viscounti and never yawn, but Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" and ""Blow Up"" are both vapid and ostentatious at the same time. Who cares about the boredom of the upper Italian classes and the trendy Carnaby Streeters anyway? Give me paparazzi decadence and Roman debauchery any day."
2,This Product Didn't Help Reduce My Redness,"Okay, I'm not impressed with this products lack in ability to help rid my face of its redness! I have mild rosacea and thought this product would help reduce the redness, but it did get rid of the redness at all. This product is expensive and it didn't work for me. I thought it was pretty drying and stripped my skin of oils. I'm just happy it didn't irritate my skin by making more red."
1,Watch with someone you Hate,I saw this movie in a free preview and everyone in the theatre had free seats. Halfway through the movie someone yelled out is this movie over yet and when it was finished every clapped that the movie was over. This is from people who got in for free!!!!
4,Nice Lenses,"The glasses are great but when they arrived, one lens was out of the frame. I fixed that but then realize that one of the arms was also loose and slips off the frame if you're not careful. Maybe I just got a bum pair but I'm going to try contacting Bolle to see what they suggest."
1,SGI V MAC,"I have had a chance to use both PC, Mac and SGI . I have done 3D Animation on all 3. SGI is the best of the group. If you want a PC with power and very few crashes you should run AMD with linux.I can not recomned a Mac. It has made false clamis of performance it is not as fastas AMD 64 or as fast as SGI."
4,"Comfort, not flash","The perfect shoe if you are on your feet a lot. It is not a flashy shoe, but very comfortable and light. Can wear with slacks or jeans."
2,Not durable soles,"They are a great fit and comfortable, but the soles are not durable. My husband has been using these shoes just a little over a month and the soles are almost wasted. He doesn't even use them everyday. It was disappointing because he likes that brand very much."
5,NUNN BUSH MEN'S CAMERON OXFORD SHOES,I bought this type of shoe a number of years ago while on a USA holiday. I found them extremely comfortable from the first day you wear them.I have been ordering them online ever since.
2,Heels wore out in 4 months,"Fit was excellent. Uppers look nice and leather is good. Laces were a tad too long. My dad wore these for 4 months. He is almost 78 so he doesn't run anything into the ground these days but the heels of the shoes did not hold up. They have those hollow pockets in them so they are not solid, long-lasting material. He wore a pair of SAS shoes for 2 years before we decided to retire them..... The Camerons looked like a good match to the SAS shoe- style-wise but forwear, they did not compare. I got a replacement pair- customer service was good enough to offer that-- but I will never buy another pair. If you wear them inside 90% of the time on carpet, you'd probably be just fine with these shoes."
5,These are Fabulous!,I own both the course and fine micrograters and I love them. For garlic they are far superior to the usual press and there is just nothing better to grate zest from a lemon. Pop them into the dishwasher for clean up and they come out like new. They are super sharp so be sure to watch those knuckles when they come close to the grater!
5,These Microplanes Rock!,"I've had these babies for over 5 years, and I STILL love them. Really sharp, and they do a great job zesting citrus. Hard cheeses (I'm looking at your Parmesan) are no match."
4,Nice book...,This hard cover book looked like new and it still helping me a lot in understanding the Windows Internals. I am waiting to look for the latest edition that will be out sometime during March 2009.
4,Good starter book,Great book for those just getting into Rottweilers with info for those with more experience as well. Explains some very common behaviors and more
4,Loud Fans,"Pretty new to the Apple thing. After being frustrated with PC's I made the jump to Apple G4. So far I like the straight forward approach, and I'm doing really cool things on Pro Tools recording software. I'm also starting to learn a little bit about Flash, Photoshop, and Quark which is really fun. If you want a good computer for creative endeavors Apple is the way to go. My main complaint about the computer is the loud fans. There is a constant hum and it makes it impossible to do any quiet computing."
1,Waste of money,"This is a pamphlet masquerading as a book. It is a slim volume written in huge type with blank pages interspersing pages of text. I read it in about 15 minutes. There is very little information in it, and certainly not enough to justify the publication of a book. Do not waste your money."
1,disappointing,"I got this book after very much enjoying Thornton's ""7 Days in the Art World"". But this book is just about unreadable. I stopped after about 30 minutes. It might have made an OK long magazine article, but it is just too booooooring."
3,Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure,"Having viewed most, if not all, of Michael Palin's adventures, this one is a trip down a well-traveled memory lane. Mr. Palin's fresh and unbiased approach to showing us today's Cuba is a welcome relief from the usual tripe fed us by our media. He presented a Cuba trying to forget the old and irrelevant Hemingway's Cuba; one copying with the challenges presented by the US economic blockade and forging a better future for its people---and along the way showing some interesting tidbits. Mil gracias Senor Palin.Rolando Arango"
5,Exelent,"I whish to come in contact with the author, if she is still alive. Please, help me: fax.no., adress etc."
3,Baa Baa Black Sheep Vol. 2,"Along with other fans of this show, I'm glad that finally after a 2 year wait Vol. 2 was released on DVD.I bought this title a few weeks ago and must say that even though I'm very happy to have this show on DVD I'm also a bit disappointed in this DVD release out of the following reasons:No digital restoration of the picture (but I can live with that)What bugs me the most is that 5 episodes were crammed on each of disc 1 and disc 2 but disc 3 only holds two episodes. I think they should have divided it evenly up into 4 episodes per disc that way the studio doesn't have to compress the episodes so much and have a better picture quality. This might be a point that should be taken under consideration if Universal plans to release Vol. 3 of this show on DVD.No specials on the dvd set.The show itself receives 5 stars, but the DVD release only 3 stars because of the reasons mentioned above."
5,I like Baa Baa Black Sheep,I really like watch Robert Conrad in Baa Baa Black Sheep. This is a very entertaining movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,The Changing of the Can,"On this album, Holger Czukay quits playing bass and switches to the radio, dictaphone, and various other bits of electronics. Enter from Traffic bassist Rosko Gee and percussionist Reebop Kwaku Baah. Bad things occur. The fluidity of earlier Can records from ""Soon Over Babaluma"" is now dispelled, replaced with a turgidity that would hit its nadir with the next release, ""Out of Reach"". Nothing on this release stands out and amazes, although what Holger is up to throughout is worth note, as it forms the basis of what he was about to start doing on his solo efforts which begin not long after this project. But the rest of the pack seems lost here, and the focus of legendary Can albums is replaced by an improvisatory meandering...wandering in the deserts near Cologne somewhere..."
2,what a disappointment!,"I bought this product hoping that it would be a good accompaniment to the supersmile toothpaste. The floss is thin and breaks easily and if it whitens in between the teeth I can't see it yet and I've been using it for enough time for it to have worked, in my estimation. I'll use it some more just to make sure I've given it enough time."
5,It' ts so coool wish i could get more of this,I am a golf talk show host on South Padre Island texas kvpa classic rock radio. I use the music on the show every sunday and the people love it wish I could find more of this kind of jake trout and the flounders they hit em long and straight as if on the course love it boys would be nice to hear more in the future signed Diesel
3,Danger on Midnight River,"Danger on Midnight River by Gary Paulsen is an adventure story. Daniel was a strong swimmer, but the swift-moving current was too much for him. It was all he could do to keep his head above the surging waves. A couple of times he thought he heard someone yelling. But for now he had his own problemes. The river was freezing cold and it offered no way out"
1,Oh come ON!,"I'm sorry, but they're awful. There's no other word to describe it. Arrested Development are the worst group to ever grace the worst genre of music imaginable. In fact, they come close to being the worst human beings alive. They're not clean and respectable, just boring. Their music is more bland than a mouthful of dry Jacobs crackers (and even more difficult to swallow). What on EARTH were they thinking of? I mean - why why why?THESE PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY DEVOID OF ANY TALENT.Do not buy anything that they've released. Speech, Baba Oje, Sister Eshe and even the 'great' Rasa Don ought to be locked up in a 4ft by 4ft room for the rest of their lives and should be made to listen to their own music 24 hours a day. It's the only punishment bad enough for them."
2,reason for disappointment,"The book was fine but the cover was torn, badly. As it was a gift I was disappointed but had no time to return it"
5,Dennis Adler at his best!,"The long awaited book, by one of the best automobile photographers is here, and it is wonderful! Glorious photography, with compositions and setting are exceptional, and can't be beat.The 100 greatest are listed in alphabetical order, so you can put them in numerical order. There is even a list of the second 100 greatest, again in alphabetical order.This is a great tribute to the persons who envisioned,designed, built, maintained, restored and have preserved these marvelous automobiles.If you have Mr. Adler's other books, you will recognize some of the photos, but there are plenty of breathtaking new ones. If you love automobiles, this is a valuable addition to your library. This top quality book is a bargain.Thank You Dennis, for your beautiful, insightful work. I look forward to your next book."
3,Beautiful cars!,"The pictures are wonderful. My husband really enjoys this book, although he says there is not enough text. A great ""coffee table"" book"
4,Good album,"I don't really like most of this rapmetal crap that seems to be popular these days (Korn, Limp Bizkit, you know what im talking about), but I was actually surprised to find that the Deftones, unlike their untalented contemporaries, were actually pretty good. Chino's lyrics are usually short and unclear yet very poetic and can be interpreted in a lot of ways. The guitar and bass are heavy yet melodic enough to satisfy those who don't want five minutes of straight power chords. I also like the band's low tuning, it helps make it even heavier. The drummer is also good, although I really didn't notice the DJ very much. My favorite tracks would have to be the two slower songs, Digital Bath and Change, which both prove that Chino can actually sing and not just rap. Back To School is also a good heavy song. Overall this is pretty good for a mainstream album."
3,"I Love the Deftones, but...","...what was the point? This CD just seems like a marketing gimmick to me. They release the exact same album with 1 extra track and a new cover. You could just Back to School off the net... Seems marketed at hardcore fans and those who haven't purchased the CD yet, and it's kind of a kick in the .... to those who already have the CD and don't wan't to spend any more money. Saddest thing is, I'll probably end up buying it..."
4,very good with a differente approach,this is one of those cd's that seem to grow on me One of the first things that i noticed was that the cd had a mellower feel to it such as in the song change. The first time i listened to it i didn't like it all that much but it grew on me. I would recomend it to any one who will listen to it for a second before giving it up.....a very good cd worthy of 4 or more starz
3,Different deftones,"the deftones have changed their approach to their music. gone is the raw angst that was force behind ""adrenaline"". they still put a lot of emotion into the songs, it is just a more mellow emotion. I'm still listening, hoping the albumn grows on me. GET THE LIMITED EDITION ENHANCED CD (if you can). put into your computer's CD-Rom drive and check out the ""joystick"" game!"
5,WOW!,"i have been a fan of the deftones since 95 and each album gets better and better. yeah this album isn't as heavy as the last 2 but who cares the music is awesome. any band can play loud and scream, but it takes true talent to make a good song and the deftones made 11 on this album. they still have their heavy songs, but they wrote more well rounded songs on this album. definetly go buy this album cuz the deftones are gonna explode"
3,niiiiiiice,Its loud and brash and soft and sweet t the same time. Tool fans would like this. But wassup with the lyrics? Anyway i like it.
4,"Well Done, Deftones!",This album sounds little bit different from their other albums but it has interesting lyrics and the new sound is good especially on the track Change(in the house of flies). Even if you haven't hear their music before you will enjoy it once you have heard it.
3,"Good, not great...","Quite honestly, the songs on Adrenaline and Around the Fur are much more interesting than the ones here. Sure, there are classics like ""Digital Bath,"" ""Knife Prty,"" ""Korea,"" ""Change,"" and ""Pink Maggot,"" just to name a few, but this sort of thing isn't really what the Deftones are best at doing. Most of the songs are really predictable... there's no more of the agressive/melodic changes that made Adrenaline so great. I would reccomend this CD to new fans only; it's a good start, but not really up to the 'Tones' best potential."
5,Great CD!,White Pony is sort of different from Deftone's previous cd's. Most of the songs are much more mellow and soft then those of Adrenaline and Around the Fur. Still the songs are very good.
3,Different,"compared to adrenaline the white pony is very different and softer. while adrenaline is better this isnt a terrible change. this new softer sound gives the deftones more of a chance to foucs on melodies, such as in digital bath and rx queen. dont worry though, the deftones have totally lost there hard sound as shown in street carp and passneger featuring the singer from tool. the track pink maggit is a trippy and weird song but good. elite is just an awful song sounding like an industrialized type song but otherwise the white pony is a very good album just dont expect another around the fur or adrenaline"
4,more emotional than the first two.,"This album is more of a statement of this bands maturity over the last few years. It is still really heavy in spots, but these guys really want you to get what they're saying by listening to the words.. I love the first two records, and practically wore them out, this one will get there too, but it may take some time. If you are a real fan and want to get further in touch with deftones music this is a must have.. If you heard a song on the radio and think this is the latest and greatest thrash album you might be disappointed.."
4,Great CD!,"The new Deftones is really good. A lot of the songs are extremely well written, and it shows that the band has come quite away since their last success ""Around the Fur."" This is probably one of the best CD's to come out this year."
1,"Chynoe, sit down. You're no Fred Durst.","A pathetic attempt to create a unique album. Chynoe thinks that all of us will buy his music because he acts punk, but if he were really punk he'd have to buy cool clothes, like Tom from Blink182. And we all know that if we want to listen to hardcore underground punk/ska, we have our Good Charlotte. So do yourself a favor, and don't buy this album, unless you enjoy supporting punk posers like Chynoe. From the reggae ""Bak 2 Skool"" to the emo/punk ""Pink Mage-it"", this album is a sure letdown. If you want a good listen, go buy Aaron Carter's debut."
1,Save yourself a ton of money on cat balls (details w/in),"Save yourself a ton of money and search for ""rainbow ball golf"" on Amazon. You can get 50 or 110 of *firm* rainbow foam balls for much less money per ball (same size as Peek-a-Prize or Smart Cat balls). BTW, the firm foam balls last longer & don't disintergrate as easily as the dimpled soft foam balls (personally I wonder if the last could cause digestive problems).I've reviewed the rainbow golf balls tooA99 Golf Rainbow Foam Ball Practice 50 Pcs with BucketA99 Golf Rainbow Foam Ball Practice 110 Pcs with Bucket"
4,Tells an exciting story well,"I had never read a book about the drive for women's suffrage, and was rather dismayed to realize this was a book for ""younger readers"" but I went ahead and read it anyway and was rather caught up in the story. My time could have been worse spent, and if I were 60 years younger I would have given this five stars!"
5,Great service and great info,I eceived the item in a timely fashion and it was exactly what I hoped it would be!!
4,Who says Blacks artists can't do Rock and Roll. Hard Rock that is!,"Mother's Finest is my favorite live band since I first saw them in '79. The live album was always my favorite. I recently got Iron Age on CD and became reaquainted with it. In a word WOW! This band can move from Rock, to Funk Rock to Hard Rock without blinking. You gotta love almost every thing they do. I saw them do a lot of these tunes plus some from ""Black Radio won't play this record"" at a Harley event. It was a harder set than they normally do and it was perfect for the Biker crowd. These folks upstage every one they"
3,Good mask but............,"I have worn this mask for less than one week. I was very happy with it until one of the straps popped out of the seam. (It's pretty useless when it won't fit your head) :) However, I sewed the strap back in place and am hopeful it will stay. Besides the minor repair, I am happy with the mask. Additionally, I have a rather small head for a woman, so this may not be comfortable for those with larger heads."
5,Lennon is truly a Legend,"This is the best collection of John Lennon out there. How can you go wrong with 20 great tracks on 1 cd? It features some great songs such as Imagine, Instant Karma, Jealous Guy, Power To The People, Woman, Watching The Wheels, and Happy Xmas (War Is Over). Any fan of great music needs this in their collection today!"
5,the legend lives on.,"this has to be one of the best cd's that shows how talented john was. imagine if he was alive today, what he would have accomplished in the music world."
5,Wonderful,"Lennon's solo career was wonderful, and this CD captures the essence of it all. From Imagine to Cold Turkey, every song makes you feel something else. This is a great way to start a Lennon collection."
3,"Good, but nothin' new","Although Lennon is and will always be the trademark of rock n' roll, this Album is nothing new to Lennon fans. Several years ago, The John Lennon Collection presented the same songs (in a different order), although some songs here were not included, but this is no excuse for fans to not buy this one. Good for new Lennon-listeners, another one for the collection for old fans."
5,Great purchase - great price,"This is some of John Lennon's very best music.....I had to have this CD after watching the documentary about him on TV titled ""Imagine"". What an extremely brilliant composer/musician. I've formed a whole new respect for him and can only be sad thinking about the music that may have been written had he been allowed to live out his life. You simply must see the documentary - his love for people, peace & music was so misunderstood in the 60's along with his political views.. His life touched this world in a beautiful and long-lasting way. This CD is one of my favorites."
4,"Brad Paisley ""Missed a Gear""?","I love the album myself, but my wife says it just isn't as good as she thought it would be. I think it is a great cruisin' cd. She thinks it is a great snoozin' cd. I am the one doing this review, so it gets a four out of five stars!"
5,Some points to consider....,"A reviewer pointed to a review on MacWorld, comparing the G5 to an Athlon Fx-51, and Pentium 4 EE, with the G5 losing the comparison...... I also found a review on PC Mag's website, comparing the dual 2ghz G5 to a Dell Precision 650, dual 3.06ghz Pentium Xeon machine, and the Mac held it's own, and even bested the Intel box in some tests, even with a 50% slower 2ghz clock speed. Also remember that the G5 is using most applications in 32-bit mode, as most applications have not yet been compiled to take advantage of the 64-bit G5. I currently have both types of systems, several Windows 2000 PC's, and a new ibook G4. Personally, I'm totally fed up with seeing the ""blue screen of death"", to the point of using Linux at home for the past 6 years. Windows 2000 and XP are alot better than the older versions, but I still have funky problems with Windows on occasion. No problems at all yet with Mac OSX. Just my 2 cents...."
5,A vector marvel!,"This is a highly recommended resource for all you graphic artists that use Illustrator/Freehand for a living. It goes to show what a good program combined with a imaginative artist can produce.Don't let the cutesy cover fool you. Hughes' body of work spans from child-oriented graphics to R-rated in some cases. His style is a mixture of grafitti, retro, and cartoon reminiscent of house, techno and rave graphics.I noticed that I've seen a lot of his art in products and have enjoyed them even before I knew about this book. I purchased this book blindly and have to say that it is one of the best buys I've had in awhile."
2,Cheap in every way...,"These pans are not worthy of the Farberware name, unfortunately...They are far too thin -- this leads to burnt food, warping, etc. The Teflon coating is the el-cheapo kind, a far cry from the superior coating you find on Farberware's upper-end Millenium models..."
2,Can you say disposable?,"These pans do not deserve the Farberware name. The thin metal will torch your food if you are not careful, and the cheap nonstick material will not last long. This gets two stars because of the low, low price.Do yourself a favor, and instead buy one quality Calphalon Commercial Nonstick pan on sale. They aren't that much more than this set, if you look hard enough, and they last forever."
5,This video kicks BUTT,"First of all, Pearl Jam is the greatest band of all time. Secondly, if you love them, you'll love this video. All of the songs played in the video are off ""Yield"", another great album by PJ. This is a must have no matter how big a fan you are of PJ. Nothing else needs to be said."
2,Ok for the money,These struts were ok for the money. They ride is not that great and I would rather get a bit better struts.
2,Caution,"I think the poses recommended in this book would be difficult for some beginners to perform if not possibly damaging to already sore backs. There are not enough cautions or alternative options for easing into poses. If you are pain free and in great shape then you could keep your back health and strong using this book. I would not recommend it to anyone who actually is currently dealing with a sore back.At the time I ordered this book I also ordered Mary Pullig Schatz's book, Back Care Basics, and I much prefer Dr.Schatz's book."
2,"the fence moves, unfortunately","I have to return this saw because the fence moves. This is an unfortunate design flaw: when you use the vise to clamp your steel against the fence, it actually pushes the fence back by a couple of degrees. I do not know how this was unforeseen. I called customer service, and they were nice. The engineering department is aware of the problem. This is not the saw to buy"
5,Milwaukee Cutoff Machine,"This have performed very well. Seems to be well built and solid. A full swing of angles on the clamp to the right and left both would be nice. The quick release is great.This saw has done everything we've wanted it too for the most part. Been used on pipe, various sizes of tubing, channel & angle iron plus re-rod."
2,don't buy it,"i felt like this dvd was thrown together purely to... row fans(or in my case 2Pac fans) into buying it. i've actually seen many of the interviews from VH1 behind the music. It also... me off that they said 2Pac was just in the rap game for money, i think they oversimplified him, and obviously didn't do any research on his personality. Personally i thought the real kicker was when this one guy kept referring to him as ""2Pack."" Basically you'd be a lot better off watching VH1's ""behind the music""--its a lot less expensive."
4,If you think you knew the truth about Death Row...,"Welcome to Death Row is detailed in every aspect of looking into what really went on at Death Row Records. It also looks into the murder of Tupac Shakur and how he MADE Death Row Records. The only bad thing about this DVD is that Ruthless Records & Death Row Records refused to give music rights in the making of this documentary. This DVD is one of the best I've seen with 2Pac in it. It also has extended interviews, out-takes and if your looking for a DVD to keep you interested..this is the one. Even if you know nothing about Death Row you are going to love this one! And if you have doubts about how we rate it don't, get a copy now and see what all the fuss is about!"
1,"It has a weird, peppery odor and flavor that is not good.",I was very disappointed with this product. It has an unpleasant peppery taste and odor. I'm not sure how to rectify this and I should not have to.
5,"Well-written, interesting mystery","I was uncertain if I would like a novel with a journalist as the main character, but Jack McMorrow is not a typical journalist, which is one reason he left the New York Times and moved to rural Maine. It is more like following an amateur detective who happens to be a journalist.Not only was the story interesting, but the descriptions were good reading as well, whether describing people or scenery. In some books you want to skip over the descriptions, but not in these...I liked this one well enough to start reading the second book in the series, which I will finish today."
4,Another brilliant collection!,"Eleven classic 90's club tracks! The Lisa stansfield mix is actually a longer version than on the CD single, which is a suprise! The Alison limerick track is different and longer than another remix I had on ""Played In Full - The 90's"". I really like the Boy George remix and the awesome 12"" of Lulu's Independence! Overall, another great collection!"
2,not what i wanted,"I ordered this CD thinking it was like some 70's songs I like. The CD sounded very bad to me. So I decided to send it back. I emailed where this CD came from. And got information to return the CD. As of April 9th, the CD has not been picked up. I mailed this CD on April 1, 2010. I BELIEVE THIS IS TOO LONG FOR A SMALL PACKAGE TO BE SITTING IN A P.O. BOX? I don't have a phone number to call. And no paperwork came with this CD when I first got it."
2,I have tried to like this CD but it is 'Fundamentally' borin,"I have tried to like this CD but it is 'Fundamentally' boring and disappointing. Bonnie Raitt is absolutely one of the best, and I've loved her music for years - roll'in down the road blast'in Bonnie - lots of times, but honestly I can hardly get through this CD. It is just an echo of all her other music (the same intros, the same sound, the same mix) coupled with the imagination of a rock. You hear the same sound here that you've heard time after time, just different words - there is nothing new. She deserves better and so does her audience. I feel ripped off."
1,A hard lesson,"This WD 500 hard drive died after 2 months of flawless use. With no warning, Windows could not find it, then could find it but said it needed to be formatted. Critical files stored on the drive were lost. WD says the drive can be reformatted and reused, but I don't trust it."
1,Drive Failed after 7 months. >:(,"The drive worked flawless for 7 months then started to die. First the USB interface started getting errors then completely failed. I switched to the eSATA connection to get my data off which I was able to then it started to give me problems as well. I was very lucky to recover my data off this drive. It's still under warranty so I will get a new one, however I am forever skeptical about their external Mybook series drives. I have always owned Western Digital hard drives and they have never let me down and have always given me countless years of use. I recommend staying away from the mybook series hard drives until WD gets some of these flaws worked out. Their internal hard drives are excellent and have never failed me. Better luck next time."
1,dont waste your time,This product did nothing to help my dog stop licking his paws. I've tried medicine and a calming collar and nothing works.
2,Quick fix,I love our vet I just keep in case of emergencies also keep in may car in my dogs first aid kit
5,Good stuff,Did the job on my lab. Cleared the hot spot off his chest. I would recommend this product. Pretty darn good
5,Provocative - this one merits your attention!,"I loved this DVD! I loved learning about these 2 great American battleships and all the interesting little facts throughout the program. Stylishly presented with quality footage and tightly written in two separate sections; it's very easy to view. It made me proud of these monstrously powerful ships and the brave people who designed, worked and died on them. I highly recommend this title to anyone who loves American History."
3,Disturbing New Book,"This book was a bit too disturbing for me. I really don't want to think about if there is not a heaven or god, but still the author has a way with his words. He makes you laugh and feel anxious at the same time. It takes place in Albany, ""If you really need to know the name of the irrelevant city,"" was I believe how DeMarco put it. Still if you like supernatural stories it's worth a read."
3,A lot of a little but not a lot of anything,"This book is an ""ideas"" book and is almost like a brainstorming session to get you going. If you were looking for inspiration you might be able to find it in here, but you will find yourself needing another resource quickly as the points discussed in this book are very brief. I'd say on average 1 to 2 paragraphs on each item point. If you're going to buy this book I would look for a used copy."
2,meh,these are all ideas you could find on the internet for free. don't bother buying this. add the money to your wedding fund.
3,Good music in a totally unnecessary collection,"How can you buy a greatest hits album when 6 of the 10 songs are from the group's first album? (go figure, the other 4 are off their second, and only other, album). That being said, the music still sounds great, but with another greatest hits edition available (the other at least has some solo cuts from Chynna and the Wilson sisters, as well as a few remixes), and the girls only having produced two full length albums, you really have to wonder if this set is even close to necessary. I say ""no"", but if you're only going to get one CD from Wilson Phillips, I guess this could fill the bill. It just seems kind of wrong to me, and more marketing strategy than effort to give something to the fans."
5,"Helpful, Practical and Inspirational!","this book is easy to read and gives the reader a sense of the author's courage, caring and spirituality. This book is really uplifting and provides many practical ways to deal with a chronic illness of any kind. It is also good for the family and friends of a person dealing with his/her illness."
1,"Come on, what a disappointment!","I really thought this would be awesome when I first heard about and after great releases like From the Vault : Shawn Michaels . Mick Foley : Greatest Hits and Misses and the Ultimate Ric Flair Collection. This DVD only contains five matches with no backround or special features or extras or even good matches. THose are:v. Undertaker : the fake version from SummerSLam 94 which has to be the all time worst PPV main event from WWE ever.v. Kwang : a masked Savio Vega match from a very early RAW, not much here actually.v. Yokozuna : casket match II, the Survivor Series one featuring Chuck Norris. Pretty slow paced match.v. Jim Neidhart : Um why , why!?!v. Jerry LAwler : Probably my favorite bout on the 10 buck buy. But of course that ain't say much at all."
4,WHAT A DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are an undertaker Fan, this is dvd is for you, i give it 4/5 becasue it should have much more matches but however it was a great dvd..."
2,Very Disapointing DVD,WWF has had a lot of great DVD's but this one fails. Only five matches on the DVD. No story lines and No Interviews. The matches are boring and a waste for a dvd. But if your an Undertaker fan you might enjoy it. I bought it and will probally never watch it again.
3,Undertaker - He Buries Them Alive,This was just an average ppv and it is from his early ages so if you like the early ppvs this is a good one for you. very good macthes though
1,Not for an aggressive chewer,If your dog is an aggressive chewer do not purchase this product. I feel it is only recommended for a puppy or small dog. It is not as durable as the orka.
5,What a Pleasure,"I have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the Canon 20d now, what a pleasure to shot. The battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots, which should be sufficient for most anybody. There is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera.The lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers.For those individuals who are on the fence about this product I tout it to all I have spoken to. It turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot, it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash.The built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time. The delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package."
1,Is the price as listed a joke?,Why is this camera and lens priced at $2495? The camera came out 5 years ago and is now completely out of date. For the same price you can buy the same lens with the 18MP Canon 7D body that also shoots HD video.
1,The fastest computer? Absolute rubbish...,"I have used this computer and the G5 is not even close to been the fastest. It is not just overpriced, it is astronomically overpriced. I don't like a company that consistently makes gargantuan exagerated claims about their products. To make matters worse Maya (Alias) is not dual processor aware on the Mac platform, despite claims to the contrary. So everything takes at least twice as long to render no matter what model G5 you buy. If you really, really want to buy this model you should wait a little while, Apple plans to cut their prices sooner than you think. However, even at half price, the G5 is still overpriced and insanely slow compared to any Pentium or Athlon based computer."
3,"Good scanner, a little noisy.",Pretty good quality scans. The holder for scanning in film negatives works pretty well. Though you can only scan in 4 or 5 at a time. It is a bit noisy though.
3,Not enough coverage on endings with pieces involved,"While there is tons of K+P vs K or K+P vs K+P coverage, there isn't really enough of say, B vs N, or R endings. Ok for what it does cover, but not complete."
4,The Ennio Morricone of the Present Age,"Robbie Robertson can paint a picture of just about anything Americana in his songs...whether it be of injustice to the Tribal Peoples to New Orleans imagery to a Southerner's angle of vision of the Civil War. He is quite able to summon the most talented and gifted people ( famous and yet-to-be-famous ) to assist in his recording work.SACRIFICE far surpasses any song he has ever done, even when he was with The Band...the message of this song will inspire and anger you."
5,music and memories,"This was a gift I'll always treasure, so meaningful to me for many reasons. It's an incredibly moving testament to Robbie Robertson's genius and roots, a combination of various styles blended with terrific melodies, some knock-out arrangements, and superb musicianship. There's a compelling intensity to Robertson's soft and husky voice, coupled with his extraordinary guitar work, that go straight to my soul.For anyone who like me, can't understand how the land of the free can tolerate the imprisonment of Leonard Peltier, ""Sacrifice"" is a must...it's heartbreaking to hear his voice, so full of courage and pain.It's hard to choose favorite tracks. A current favorite is ""Unbound"", but this music is so multi-layered that I know that the more I listen, the more I'll find to like. This universal music can't be categorized or forgotten...it has great beauty, and many memories."
4,This was so good until ...,"I came to June Calvin not knowing what to expect from her, this being the first book I had read by her.To summarize briefly (without spoilers): the plain sister is the heroine - but the beautiful sister is not jealous, mean, nor petty-spirited. The family are all decent, and thoroughly believable. So is the hero Jack. Jack is brought along as a suitor for the beautiful sister, but as things fall out, he ends up offering for someone else.The problem: at the wedding, things started to go wrong... not just for the unhappy groom, but also for this reader. Reading the last chapter, I felt as if I were reading about a different heroine and a different family from the one I had encountered so pleasantly.Warning: Like Dorothy Mack's MOCK MARRIAGE, read upto about page 200, and then set aside. Contrive a happy ending for the couple then and there, by yourself.Rating = 4.1 ([points lost for hackneyed and out-of-context ending)"
1,(Everybody's Free) Not to buy this album,"Don't worry about the future or worry knowing that knowing that worry is just as effective as trying to buy this album. The song is cheesy, and has a beat with a dude talking. I have to admit that one song(wear sunscreen) has a great message. The rest is worthless Dont buy this cd, it will only make you feel ugly."
1,Everybody's free.... to waste their money,"Excuse me people, this is a column for the review of the ALBUM, not the novelty song. Don't bother plunking a single penny for this album. Instead, tape this on the radio when it gets played every hour or so. Everybody will forget the novelty song in a couple months or so anyway.P.S.: Baz, don't quit your day job."
3,It's pretty cool!,"This song/speech, Everybody's Free... Is actually pretty good. But, it amazes me at how many people still don't know the correct story about it. IT WAS NOT KURT VONNEGUT, and it wasn't at MIT either. But anyway it is good advice and I think everyone should listen to it at least once."
1,Sunscreen only worthwhile song,"If you are considering buying this CD in expectation of other 'Sunscreen' type songs...don't. The rest of the CD is a really, really, really bad group of remixed songs better left in the 1980's.Sunscreen is great, but buy the single or download the MP3...save your money for much better CDs."
2,"Good concept, but bad result","This album is a disappointment.....the remixes are not very creative, they're rather short, and on the whole everything falls flat. There are some worthy to mention tracks like ""Time After Time"" and ""Now Until the Break of Day"". As for the speech song - ""Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen"" - it's an interesting listen, but I wouldn't call it a song, and I don't understand what everyone's raving about.....I wouldn't recommend purchasing this album - maybe borrow it from a friend first and then decide."
4,"Refreshing, thought-provoking, and instinctive; great music","I recommend this Cd to everyone who is looking for something inspiring,entertaining,and refreshing. The song ""Everybody's free.."" may come across as unsolicited advice to the younger listeners, but to someone who has endured the ups and downs of life it is a wonderfully nostalgic reminder of the days and the opportnuties gone by. The song is somewhat dark with overtures of regrets as well as promises of the future juxtaposed against one another. And as you grow old (er) you begin to enjoy it more, I promise you."
4,Makes You Think,"The album is fair, but ""Everybody's Free To Wear Sunscreen"" really makes you think about what life is about. Lee Perry really tells the story in a great way. It's almost like all of the ideas said in this song were sitting right in front of you- you just never took the time to sort them out. The mood of the song is excellent as well. Great song, great lyrics, and a pretty good CD too. But Sunscreen is worth the whole 16 bucks."
2,Don't waste your money,"Okay ... why on earth this selection is listed under best sellers for general dance music is waaaay beyond me. This is one of those cd's that looks good, but is a huge disappointment once you receive it and listen to it. You are much better off with an MTV mix (and I don't care for those at all) than with this compilation."
4,Wonderful collection of our modern ideals.,"This CD reminded me of many good and bad things that have happened in my life. Though I still have a long way to go, I have not regretted one moment. ""everybody's free..."" is a fantastic way to get the message across to the world's next generation. The song from ""Lake Lost"" is one of the most beautiful and moving works of modern art I have and probably ever will hear. I have listened to that song at least 3000 times since I bought the CD and I'm still not sick of it. In fact it has sparked some interest in me on where the rest of that musical went. If I do have one complaint though, it is the repetition of the songs from the movies by Luhrmann. I was a bit disappointed to see this having already owned the sound tracks for ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""Strictly Ballroom."" (I have overlooked that now anyway.) I think this is a must buy for anyone with a taste for modern cultural music."
5,Very Powerful,"I too had to turn up the radio and listen to every word. I really ""felt"" the words. This Saturday I plan to play Everybody's Free at my Son's wedding and will hand him a tube of sun tan lotion as a symbolic jesture just before playing it."
1,Too Dumbed Down,"I'm only a layperson who struggles to understand the basic concepts of physics, but I found this Nova treatment of string theory completely lacking in substance. How many animations does it take to convey NO information? Apparently, a lot. This documentary consists of little more than image after image -- most of them unimaginative and unenlightening. Do I need to see apples falling on Brian Greene to understand gravity? Do I need to see those apples several times? No. The program is absurdly repetitive, and keeps promising information that it does not deliver. Save your money and read the book."
1,NOTHING like the book!,"Brian Greene has no greater fan (except maybe his mother), and his magnificent book The Elegant Universe is phenomenal. I expected this tape to discuss some of the perplexing issues relating to superstring and M theory. Instead I ended up with something made to appeal to grade school children--lot's of goofy special effects and only the most cursory treatment of the subject. If you expect to learn anything from this video, you'll be bitterly disappointed. The only reason I gave it even one star was because it was nice to actually see and hear the author--a truly brilliant scientist who possesses the rare gift of illuminating complex subjects for the general public. Get the book instead. After you read The Elegant Universe, get his next book, The Fabric of the Cosmos. Forget about this ridiculous, juvenile video. (I do not mean to be nasty--just want to spare other people from the cost and disappointment of this video.)"
2,eye candy and little else,"The production seemed more like an exercise in computer graphics ""eye candy"" than a serious study of string theory and the controversy surrounding it. The skeptics were given short shrift and, as expected, Green and the rest of the M-theory high priests proselytized as best they could (you gotta have faith). Try Sparkchamber (www.sparkchamber.co.uk/archive/elegant1.html) or do a Google search for ""Multiverses and Blackberries"" by Martin Gardner of ""Scientific American"" fame."
2,Very repetitive,"There is maybe 20 minutes of unique interesting footage in 3 hours of video here. It was unbelievably repetitive. There are definitely some interesting explanations, and the animations were great, but how many times to do we need to see the same animation or quote from a physicist?I kept waiting for it to get into the meat of string theory, and it never did. Obviously the math is very complex, so there's a limit to what they could get into on a TV show. However, all the information given here on the actual theory could be easily summarized in about 5 sentences. 3 hours is a lot to watch for that much information.** Edit: ** To be fair, I watched this on PBS, not the DVD. The PBS version was probably much more repetitive because of segment lead-ins and other promos (""Next time on Elegant Universe...""). This is probably why I saw the same clips over and over. Still, I stand by my statment that there is very little informaton here. This is nothing more than a teaser on string theory."
4,Excelente!!!,"Este es un video que te muestra algo mas alla de la teoria del big bang las explicaciones son tan simples que resulta increible que pueda ser algo tan complejo, definitivamente lo recomiendo, solo hay un pero y es que no tiene subtitulos en español solo tiene closed caption pero no te arrepentiras !!!"
4,Did not view the video,"I took this video out of the local library for someone else. They lost the video, so I had to replace it. It would have cost me more for the library to replace the video, so I decided to look for it on Amazon.com. I found your video at a good price and turned it in to the library."
5,Beautiful Presentation,The beauty and simplification of the universe's range and rules is well done here.
4,Wonderful book,"I received this book as a gift recently. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. The title of the book implies that it is a novel about St. Benedict, but he is actually just one of many characters in this historical novel. DeWohl does a wonderful job describing the Roman world at the time of St. Benedict, making it come to life.If you are a fan of historical fiction, read this book. If you are a fan of Louis DeWohl, read this book."
5,"""Real"" Haiti","After 3 years of paying close attention (i.e. obsession) to news and media about Haiti (and 4 trips to Leogane), this film is the best depiction of the country I've seen. It gives Haitians voice--subtitles, not voice-dubs. Honest about the country's desperation, but hopeful because the solidarity Haitians feel with each other underlies the whole film. A must see."
4,Manowar,"Well, well. What I can say, manowar is actually good metal band, and some composition are really awesome, but lyrics... I'm just getting tired of these lyrics- fight, fight, fight for the metal, fight to be a kings of metal etc. this is sooo immature. It's like a little kid - I want to be a king. Don't get me wrong though, songs like Courage are absolutely amazing. I think these guys need to find a good lyric writer. I gave them 4 starts just because of some crappy lyrics. I hope that in the future Manowar will change that ""fighting"" crap out and more good songs will be written."
2,"Man, what a joke!! But it has good songs!","ONe must be out of his mind to spend fifteen bucks in this album, which has, arguably, the worst cover art ever for a heavy metal album!! Unvbeliavable!! Four guys dressed in third-rate ""warrior"" clothes! Man, I almost died from excess of laughter when I first saw it!!!As for the music, there's a certain freshness on it that make it worthwhile at certain points, but not can disguise the fact tha MANOWAR is a very bad band, with good musicians, but thrilling the wrong path (""Death to posers"", ""death to false metal"", etc, etc, as if they were the best in what they do. Answer: they are not! THey can't even kiss the feet of metal bands like Maiden, Priest, Slayer, old Metallica, Motorhead, etc. They simply are not skilled enough!)"
1,What is the riddle of steel?,"When I first heard Manowar, I thought they were the greatest spoof on heavy metal since Spinal Tap. Then I realized that this was no joke - THESE GUYS WERE ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS. Apparently Joey DiMaio thinks that what the world needs most is a swords-and-sorcery anthem from a bunch of guys who have probably played far too much Dungeons and Dragons. This is ""Conan Metal"" at its most ridiculous. Funnier than Gwar - but only because they don't realize they're kidding."
5,Chating Online,I talk for a whole hour and get to E-mail people whenever I want and I can stay on as long as I want.I like to talk so much on Aol that's what I Like the best about Aol and I like E-mailing to people and chating to long online with my brothers friends when ever I can
3,Great watch but lacking...,"Compared to its sister release this month along with the horrible rushed put whatever Undertaker : He Buries them Alive its Cause' Stone Cold Said So. I really found this sixty minute video quite entertaining actually. Pretty great stuff before Owen broke his neck, so he is capable to work an awesome match plus he was really determined in his promos rising to the top. The problem I have is that there is no extra features which does not really make any sense since it is a Digital Video Disc. Nonetheless it's a quite entertaining watch. By the way Hell Yeah and What? or some good Austin videos as well."
5,Intriguing and Engaging,"I consider this novel special not just because the characters are interesting and believable, but also because the story, very quietly and cleverly, pulled me inside its plot. In various scenes, I would become intrigued with questions such as, ""How would I react if this happened to me?"" and, ""Could I do, or want to do, the same thing as the main character does?"" And, ""Could I live with myself if I did what Ben does?"" Very engaging."
2,"Nice effort, but...","Bought this album based on a write up in the Wall Street Journal and have to say I was a bit disappointed. A number of good tracks and a number of mediocre ones. The problem is a poor selection of material, not enough Willie and too much of his supporting cast. Johnny Gimble in particular can't really cut it in this type of music."
2,No Fragance,"I have used this product before for many years, I got this new bottle and it has to be a copy has no smell, no matter how much I put on does not smell. Original last for hours and it smells great! not happy with Happy by Clinique, which I could return, a waste of money!!!!"
1,Complete junk,"Worked for a short time before displays failed on both handsets. Base charger stopped working. If you can get these to keep working for more than a month consider yourself very lucky. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK."
5,Great Gloves,"These are very nice gloves. The leather is a good quality and the silk is very comfortable. I would buy more of these if I needed more. I don't like their cashmere lined gloves however, as the cashmere is rough--mine from Neiman's are really nice, so I had high hopes for those from this source, but it didn't pan out. The silk lined are great though."
2,Uses too much ink,I've had this printer for a couple years and it works but it seems like I'm constantly out of ink and I rarely print things.It runs through black ink very quickly. I also runs through the color cartridges suprisingly fast even though I never print photos or things with much color.
2,CRICHTON FANS GOT SNUCK ON THIS ONE,"How could such a great book be turned into such a horrible movie?? Congo is my favourite Crichton book and to see it butchered like this is painful. Tim Curry seems to know the movie sucks, and he chews the scenery to shreds providing the one thing that's reasonably entertaining in this film. Read the book."
3,Beautiful scenery...,"No, it's not a good movie, but the scenery and production design is inventive, exotic and invigorating! But then again, I'm prejudiced. J. Michael Riva, the production designer, used my travelogue, ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made"" as a visual research tool for the film!"
4,A fun and goofy ride,"Come on, this movie isn't so bad. I can name dozens of films that are far, far worse. At least this one is entertaining all the way through, no slow spots, a lot of humor, great scenes in Africa, a talking gorilla, decent cast. What's not to like?Tim Curry and Joe Don Baker overdo it on purpose as the greedy guys who just want diamonds and don't care who dies. Laura Linney sounds like she's on the verge of shrieking and her hair looks perfect even while she's on a safari. Dylan Walsh is very engaging as the scientist with the talking ape, Amy. Grant Heslov is the hapless assistant who is just along for the ride but wants to go home. Ernie Hudson is an interesting guide who turns out to be very resourceful.Don't take it too seriously. Just enjoy."
4,Good fun action,"I loved this movie!!! This is a fun, action movie not to be taken seriously. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it wasn't aiming too, although, it does have future Oscar nominee(for another movie), Laura Linney, who was terrific in this. She kicked major [rear] in this movie. She was tough from beginning to end. No simpering, whining or crying from her. What I really liked about it, was Amy, the gorilla and the search for the Lost City of Zinn. I love researching about lost cities, and of course this was a fictional movie, but that part of the plotline intrigued me. Ernie Hudson was a riot in this, serious and mostly funny, and w/ Dylan Walsh, Tim Curry and a cameo from Joe Pantoliano.I liked everyone in this film. Either you love it, hate it or have mixed feelings about it, and I love it. :)"
4,A Classic Book on Vocabulary,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in improving their vocabulary. Just remember to take each exercise (in the book) seriously. Also, it takes time to master all the words, so you need to be patient and disciplined. In general - a great book!"
1,Its not this easy,"Why do you want to increase the size of your vocabulary? If you want just want to show off then this may be a book for you. However, if you want to be able to formulate your thoughts more precisely stay away from it. The method that the author proposes gives you a rough idea of the meaning of a word. That's it. After working through the book you may be able to say the same thing in six different ways, but you will not be able to tell the subtle differences in implication. That the author likewise lacks this level of sophistication becomes abundantly clear, e.g., when he claims that a palace and a castle are 'the same'. In order to really extend your vocabulary I would rather recommend to read book by Joyce, Hemmingway or Dickens -- they also make a more enjoyable read."
5,Great diaper/pull-up for my toddler,"This is our current favorite diaper. They seem to hold up to the big wetness challenge a little better than the Pampers Cruiser which we have also used.. also it's convenient sometimes to be able to pull the diaper on like underwear insteand of having to secure it with the velcro (though velcro tabs are also an option with the Convertibles).FYI this acts like a diaper on the baby, not a conventional ""Pull-Up"", it hold the wetness away from the skin and keeps it feeling as dry as possible, so if you are in the serious phase of potty training then you might want to use a regular pull-up (which the child feels as wet against the skin)."
5,Holes in the floor of heaven.,"When my dad passed away in 98, on my drive to his funeral this song played over and over. On my drive back it was storming and I got nervous and I asked my dad to watch over me and low and behold Holes in floor of heaven played and I knew my dad was watching and I would be safe. And even 2 yrs later when I am depressed and low this song will play and I know my dad is watching. Thank you Steve for a very moving song, which will ease me for yrs on in."
4,overall a good cd,"steve has done it again. if you have evver lost a love, or a loved one this cd is a must for you. holes in the floor of heaven is one of the prettiest songs i haveheard in a long time. And ""big tops"" is another great song. Steve wariner keeps on writing great music"
1,good movie/lousy quality recording,"Constantly stopping & ""re-loading"" makes this almost impossible to watch. A real rip-off. Doubt I'll ever buy another movie on Amazon."
4,Great reference!,"I haven't gotten a chance to read more books by John Dee, but I am very sure this will help me understand the rest. I suggest getting this first before anything else."
4,AN EXCELLENT ADDITION TO THE RADIOHEAD REPITOIRE,"I am in awe of the stylistic variance of Radiohead. ""The Bends"" and ""Ok Computer"" are both fabulous albums, and each reflects a different arsenal of tricks, treats, and themes. ""How Am I Driving"" seems to be a glimpse into the next evolution of the band's changing style, combining the futurism of ""Ok Computer"" with a few entirely new sounds: the gritty brashness of ""Pearly*"" and ""Polyethelene""; the quirky lullaby ""Melatonin."" While ""A Reminder"" seems to recall the ethereal tone of ""Ok Computer,"" its subject matter, growing old, is decidedly divergent. As an EP, ""How Am I Driving"" does its job, complimenting the band's wildly succesful LP albums, while providing dedicated fans with an exciting collection of new songs and B-sides. The next LP should be smashing."
5,Some of my favorite b-sides,"A great Ep for anyone who enjoys Radiohead. Airbag contains some of my favorite RH b-sides in Pearly* and Polyethylene.Pearly* has a great riff, and strange lyrics. A Reminder and Melatonin is pretty good too, not their best work but listenable. Meeting In the Aisle is boring, I usually like insturmentals though. Palo Alto is quirky and would've fit in perfectly on Ok Computer. Polyethylene is one of RH best songs and will bring you back to listen to this EP.Great buy considering the price."
4,good OKC follow-up,"While somewhat lacking in the personality and melody that the extraordinary tracks of OK Computer all possessed, this EP is nonetheless worth the money. The rough guitar chords are reminiscent of The Bends; whereas the technological aspects and ambient effects make it more of an OKC companion. Palo Alto is perhaps one of the best tracks on this EP and deserves recognition. A good mini-album."
2,I was expecting so much more...,"Not as intersting as Into the Pandemonium. The 1st 2 tracks set the the expectations...but it doesnt progress.Pretty heavy regardless, and the remaster sounds great.Classic dark metal, slightly boring, dated.What I like about these guys is how they tuned the guitar and bass. Great tone..you only wish theyd dig into the wierd riffs more often, do some more time changes. They got the right sound...but not the best of material to play.Into The Pandemonium has a few killer tracks that pick up where this left off...and a few strange ones. I beleive Into.. is their best achievment."
4,Honestidad Brutal: Un L.P. descarnizadamente auténtico.,"Ya lo conocemos, Calamaro no se resiste. Su lúcida locura rompe la camisa por fuerza mayor. Este nuevo disco demuestra lo prolífico que es... 36 nuevas canciones que pasando por tango, bolero, bossa nova y hasta funk, nos hablan de amor desamor, fronteras e identidades y claro está, de banalidades, de la cotidianidad que también nos golpea y nos damos cuenta de ello cuando un hombre de tal sensibilidad nos abre los ojos y el alma con su honestidad brutal. No tiene pierde."
3,Not much to say - it's a filter,"Not much for rating a filter unit. It's just a replacement canister. It seems to work fine in it'sattachment, no clogs experienced in past canisters."
1,Filter bursts at the bottom after 8 months.,"I was very happy at first with this Culligan product until at about after 9 months, the filter bottom split open, flooding the kitchen floor and cabinet area. I thought it was a fluke thing and installed a new filter. The same thing happened at around 8 months with water everywhere. I called Culligan to report this and they said they have never heard about this problem??? The filter has a engineering flaw at the base where it is seemed together. I DO NOT recommend a Culligan water filtration system. Besides the water damage I have, they weren't even willing to send a new filter or acknowledge that they have a design flaw. The Culligan representative told me to try the EZ-4 filter, but after reading reviews, I found that it's happening with the EZ-4 filter as well. I have never had this problem with the GE filters, so I'm going back to them."
5,Get started on a great 5 book series!,"Unfortunately, Andrew Britton died in the prime of an extremely talented career. However, you have got to get this, 1st of four, exciting, heartracing, can't put down books about CIA analist Ryan Kealey who throughout the series saves countless lives, not to mention American interests at home and around the world. You will not be dissapointed with the books Britton has released. The only dissapointment you will have is that he is not around to continue an extraordinary thriller series.My sincere condolences to his family. To the readers out there that love spy/espionage books, get started now with The American!Followed by- The Assasin, The Invisible, The Exile, and his latest comes out in June 2011."
2,Don't believe the breathless jacket blurbs,"I only made it through about 75 pages before the predictable plot and absent editing did me in. An Iranian character is described as ""Arabic"" looking, the name of Iran's current spiritual leader is wrong, an FBI agent has a cellphone in each hand but suddenly barks into a walkie-talkie, the hero races down Connecticutt Ave. in his SUV (sorry, no can do, unless it's 2 a.m.). Does anyone edit books anymore ? There are also the usual stock characters- the hero with a terrible secret, the mindless killing machine as villian, the CIA analyst who just happens to be equally handy with weapons and looks great in low-rider jeans...please !"
3,Elementary Error,"I like this author, but oh what a factual mistake right in the middle of the book!Iranian Air 655 shot down over the Atlantic Ocean? I don't think so. Makes you wonder what else is wrong."
4,Les Hommes - Les Hommes,"If you know the 18th Street Lounge, you know what to expect from Les Hommes and their self-titled debut: mellow, jazzy, delicious. Tracks like the funky and luscious ""Intraspettro"" help elevate this album above some of its contenders, but, as a whole, it never reaches any new, dizzying heights, either. There's plenty of the cinematic music (the dark and moody ""Weegee"") and free-wheeling, Italian jazz (the bouncy ""Pousada Do Amor"" or ""Hommage"") that have become ESL's trademarks. What's not to like, really?"
3,Driven to Tears,"The Police are a great band. Just not as great as they were. If your looking to this as what's heard on the cd's, forget it. Some songs still sounded good but some were killed in some forced remakes. Wrapped Around Your Finger is a standout let down for me. Sounds nothing like the actual song, but instead a slow rythmic droning annoyance. Copeland plays great throughout. Andy Summers is good but somewhat hard to hear clearly. Sting is fantastic on bass, but awful singing. Not that he doesn't hit the notes but that every song as Sting moaning and ooooing way too often. In fact his over doing it made me skip songs. Pretty cheap and not too good. Unless you want to add concert dvd's to build a collection (like me) or are a die hard Police fan i'd would skip this one."
5,Funny as hell..Keep them coming!,"You guy are the man! We listen to yall every year at our hunting camp by the fire. We just sit there and laught til midnight! More volumes please, We can recite all the words the the other volumes"
3,What Kind Of Music?,"My sister and I were discussing this CD and could not determine what kind of music Brian Setzer has made this season brighter with...Is it rockabilly? Big band? What?The lyrics in this Christmas special argue that it's a form popularized in the mid-to-late 50s. It represents a transition into the rock and roll classic era, no question, but so many of those artists had by then abandoned the big band sound.Anyway, it would not be Christmas without the leering allusions of this funny, lively album. The production value is pure Cinerama, and you won't be bored with the adaptations. The only cut I had a too-hard time with was the Nutcracker variations; somehow they reminded me too much of the Spike Jones version which, by comparison, sounded better.""Tis the season."""
1,yuck,"this product didn't work for me, adult hormonal acne. i wouldn't recommend it for any female sufferers out there. l,"
1,Homeopathic medicine is no better than a placebo,"As it turns out, homeopathy is the practice of diluting a substance so wholly in water that there is practically none of the substance left. Homeopathic remedies rely on the water to ""remember"" the substance and incur the substance's effects, when in reality... it's just water! If homeopathic remedies worked, we'd all be dead from drinking homeopathic sewage from the water remembering our what we flush down our toilets!Don't buy this garbage!"
1,Did not work!,After I started using it - my acne has gotten way worse by having it on my back & shoulders. This has not happened with other medications - I will stick with Nature's Cure or Clearin
5,Unbelievable product!,"This product is saving my life, my face started to clear up after a few days I started taking this pill. I don't know if other people will have the same results, but this pill is sure worth trying. I've suffered from acne all my life and the topical over-the-counter medications stopped working, must be because my skin got used to them, anyway, I am feeling like a normal person again. I also recommend for you to use it along with a good skin care system."
3,Set is From the 1990s,"Buyers need to be aware this set was originally marketed in the mid to late 1990s, and it has pre-remastered versions of ""Help!"" and ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and two documentary disks-but no copy of ""A Hard Day's Night"". I bought mine for about $22 at a Fred Meyer store in Boise in 1998. As long as you understand it is a nice collector item, but has old versions of the two movies, you'll be ok with it. If you are looking for the new, Apple remastered versions of the movies, you will be disappointed. I was happy to see my set is now worth a lot more than I paid for it!"
2,????,"I don't understand why this magazine subscription is so expensive! I has good info, but not worth the money."
1,not properly presented,"This saw works great on light iron, such as purlin. When cutting heavy pipe or structural steel, the blade quickly overheats and the life of the blade is shorter than abrasive blades. Milwaukee does not tell you that this machine is not suited for hardened steel or galvanized iron. I made 10 cuts with this saw on 2 3/8 in. pipe and the 10 th. cut was the blades last. I was very disapointed in the life of this $100.00 blade. If you only cut light iron, this saw is the best. If you plan on cutting any shaft or bolt, forget it. The blade can not handle the heat."
5,Excellent Songs !,"if you like melodic alt rock buy this CD, you won't be dissappointed, for me it was a really pleasant surprise, the songs are top notch and the production quality is awesome, a lost gem ..."
1,Bad Purchase,I bought this CD as new one and I received it with the cd box opened and broken as if I had bought as used. Fortunately the CD looks like new and it doesn't have any scratch.Regards
1,Forget About It,"The first book of disappointment came with Sean's story and it has gone downhill from there and I don't think it can get much lower then Luke's story. The story is hard to believe, there isn't a story really, no chemistry between the characters, dull boring and an insult to Leigh Greenwoods readers. The Cowboys would and should have been a wonderful series. Someone else should have written it."
1,Beware of purchasing from Amazon,"I might actually have a review of this product if Amazon would ever ship it to me. It showed as in stock and I ordered this scanner on 1/15 and upgraded to next day shipping. As of 1/20, they still haven't shipped it yet even though the item is still supposedly in stock. I've emailed them on three occasions, each time Amazon responded with a promise that it would be shipping that day and each time it didn't. They refuse to cancel the order, telling me to return the scanner when I receive it if I no longer want it. They won't even refund the charge for overnight shipping even though it's been almost a week and has yet to leave their building. I've been an Amazon customer for a long time, but this experience has been so frustrating that I think I'll look elsewhere for future purchases."
4,My first scanner,"It's my first scanner, so I'm not the best person to write a review about scanners. But, for someone with almost 30 years of photos of trips and family (and many wonderful memories), this is a nice scanner. The photos look beautiful after being scanned. It scans pretty quickly, but if you have a lot of photos to scan it will take you awhile since you can only do one photo at a time. On the plus side, it's easy to use. It also does a good job with documents. For the price, it was a good buy."
3,Epson Scan software gets frequent out of memory error,"I have the same problem another user reported with Epson Scan. They succeeded in reaching Epson who said the software has a memory management defect. In my case, my machine has Gigabytes of memory and hundreds of megabytes of free hard disk. The Epson software will not even let me do a Grey scale scan of an 8.5x11 photograph at 1200 dpi. It says I'm out of memory. However I'm looking at my memory allocation when I do this and I have Gigabytes of free memory when this error comes up. I have the latest Epson Scan software and am having this problem. Great hardware, but software is not as good as what I expected or needed."
4,Epson Perfection 4490 Photo Scanner,"So far o good, it works great! perhaps a bit slow.I just attempted to use the Photoshop Elements 2.0 that came with it but the software is obsolete. That is part of the reason I would not give 5 stars and may have bought a Canon scanner if I had know the Photoshop was not up to date or if Photoshop were not included. I had to purchase a current version of Photoshop in order to be able to use it.I also wish it had film trays for older 110 negatives and Kodak disk negatives as I have may from the 70's and 80's I'd like to scan in...."
2,Not what I had hopped For,"I missed the window for getting a full refund, otherwise I would have returned this scannar. It does terrible work with color film scanning is poor. Epson software is pretty much worthless."
4,Fine product,"I purchased the Epson 4490 scanner to digitize 35mm slides & negatives. So far I have scanned about 1500 images with great results. It is easy to use for even someone with modest computer skills. Easy hook-up to your computer, I would recommend this to anyone with alot of photos to save & share."
2,Buy the Canoscan 8600F instead,"I brought this through Amazon. It was difficult to use. The software is not very intuitive. It was shipped with Elements 2.0, which is obsolete. The scans were unsatisfactory. After trying to get this machine to work, I gave up and returned it to Amazon.I have since bought the Canoscan 8600F from Amazon. It is a great product, and includes the current version of Elements, 4.0."
2,not a good scanner for negative films,"Our office bought this scanner mainly to scan negative films. The set up manual was easy to use but I can't scan negative film especially on panoramic x-rays. I bought this scanner because I manually want to scan pano x-rays. After having such a headache trying to figure out the correct settings on the scanner, I called the Epson's tech department. They have no clue regarding scanning negative films and was not a help at all. We decided to return the scanner instead."
3,Good scanner..but not for 35mm slides,The scanner itself seems to be very good quality scanner with good features but I bought it specifically to scan old 35mm slides to digital pictures. Even at the brightest setting the slides were still very dark and not accepatble quality. It appeared as if not enough light was passing through the slide transparency. I had to return the scanner and will be trying a low end dedicated film/slide scanner.
2,Deadly tea poisoning lady more like...,"Ok, let me start off with saying i'm actually disappointed in how misleading the cover art and title of this film is. If poisoning someone's tea is classed as being ""deadly kung fu"", hell everyone could be a deadly kung fu artist in no time. Here's me thinking it required some knowledge of actual kung fu... :/The cover art shows a woman in ninja type gear... Again, she doesn't wear anything of the sort. The story is actually more about an assassin male, who the ""deadly kung fu lady"" hires. There are some not bad fights, but nothing to really write home about. I'm sorry, i can't rate a DVD i bought decently when it's so misleading. Shouldn't be allowed to happen..."
1,Unable to get to work,"Very frustrated with this product and their customer service. Can't seem to find a compatible ""code"" to enter for my DVD player.. and thus the DVD game won't work until it recognizes your DVD player. I have contacted customer service twice and so far to no resolution. I will try to contact them one more time and if no luck then I guess I will have to return the game."
5,"A Spare, Intimate Challenge","Wagner's book has been compared to Jack Spicer's work and to the work of John Berryman. Both poets have clearly had an influence, but Wagner's poems are far more combative. I thought to say, put your hand in Wagner's book and she'll slap the tar out of you. That would be my blurb, and I mean it in the best way. Reading Miss America, you engage an intelligence -- much as if you were forced to really read a miss America rather than just look at her treats and snacks. The treats and snack are here, too, but you got to pay the lady her propers."
4,review from JEK student at MLMS,"The book "" Not without my Daughter"" was overall a great story. It was about an american women named,Betty Mahmoody who goes to Iran with her husban and finds herself traped with her daughter as hostages. Through out the story Betty deals with Iran culture and laws that she can not grow custom too. While Betty and her five year old daughter Mathob, were prisoners in a forein country her father in american was dieing from cancer. Betty tries everything to get out of iran but in this country the husbans have all the control of the wife and childer. She finally meets a man who helps get her out of Iran. Through a dangerous trip through the icy hills of turkery and Iran, Betty and Matonb escape the horror of Iran and its people.A good story but i would like to hear Moody,s side."
1,a review from B.D. from mlms,"The story,""Not Without My Daughter"" is the story of an American woman who marries an Iranian man. He takes her to Iran on a ""trip"" and decides to keep her there. I didn't like this book. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this story."
1,TKL at Student M.L.M.S.,"I think this book is the most boring book I've ever picked up. I hated that it went back in time. I thought that it was very discriminative to Iranians, one of my best freinds isIranian and it makes him and his family look like bad people. I didnt like that she wrote the book to complain I know she ahd a hard you dont have to write a book about it. I dont recomend this book to anyone.. Im not goin to even bother to tell much more. I give this book a one star."
1,"Unfair, false and trashy story!","With the artificial, fake story and political help of William Hoffer Betty made a chunk of money and her selfishness deprived a father from his doughter...very silly and absurd book. Doesn't worth a penny."
1,Based on a real lie,"A very boring story about a seemingly very vengeful woman. We all make mistakes in life, and try to learn from it. But Betty Mahmoody is making money out of it but making up a story in which potrayes herself as the victim. I watched this woman complaining on the Dr. Phil show recently, still sobbing and feeling sorry for herself and at the same time promoting her book and trying to squeeze the last couple of bucks out of her story.Thanks to the Finish documentary `Without my daughter' which shows us what really happened we now know that this book is just one big lie.Maybe they don't show you these documentaries in the US, I'm sure your government would like you to believe that all women are suppressed in countries like Iran.Do not buy this book, don't buy the DVD. Dishonesty should not be rewarded.Herman, Europe"
1,PROPERGANDA...........(obviously),"The story it self sounds abit TOO wierd cause I have travelled to Iran a lot and basically..I think this book was written on MARS....anyway ..besides that....it is amazingly racist...Iranian stinks.(bad smell)...Iranians don't really care about their children..and so many examples...We have to remember that we are talking about a country which is the home land to big poets like....HAFIZ, Roomy,SADI, FERDOSI...and drinking alcohol is very bad?...well just remember there is a city in IRAN called SHIRAZ...search for it.... and some of the comments in this pages are racist as well..sure....iran is a 3rd world country and not as great as USA... but there are many things that u find in iRAn that U can't find anywhere else in the world...read the BOOK....but personally it makes me so sad that the world (even today) can appriciate racism. I recommend you to read a book called My uncle Napeolon....that is my favourite book and MOVIE......"
1,Don't even touch it.,"I've read the book and seen the movie.A very common family problem has been turned into apolitical,social,cultural and religious degradation of a proud and ancient nation.The only reason that this type of litrature is allowed to be printed is the current political situation.You would not find a simmilar book aboutblacks or jews that would portray them in a negative way.But somehow it is an open seasonon Iranians.I am all for freedom of speech,but I hate it whenpeople take advantage of political climate and make money by insulting other poeple's culture.I find it to be nothing more than prostituting the pen when it's used not to educate but only to satisfy the public's thirst for an uncivilized andbackward enemy,so they can feel good abut themselve"
1,Again,Here we go. Another story about some poor woman who didn't get things the way she wanted. Now we write a book to make it all look like the fault of everyone and everything else in her life. It's a book that should say it's only one side of the story. It is presented as being some horrible event but it is a bit too much revenge sounding. Didn't like it. Didn't believe it.
1,Sorry,"Again I have to say sorry to this one. I am a reader only of Non-Fiction. As a fiction probably a good one, but as to non-fiction not one I would recommend. No proof and didn't sound likely to me. Sounded more like a book of scorned woman."
1,false perceptions,"The book and movie are littered with defamatory statements about Iranian culture, Iranian women, and Iranian people. Since the book is touted as being true, these false statements are particularly damaging.I really sympathize with all individuals whose lives were damaged by the trauma of divorce, and the particular complications of international custody laws.However, because the book and the movie contain numerous, broad, negative generalizations about Iranians, and because portions of the book are certainly false, I condemn the book and movie on the grounds that it strengthens false and negative perceptions about Iranians.At a time when the importance of tolerance is appreciated by all, it is sad to see that an individual propagates false information and targets for fame by defaming one of the strongest cultures in the world in such a trifling manner. Freedom of speech has seldom been mocked so carelessly."
3,"GLW-Student at Mace's Lane Middle School-Cambridge, MD","""Not Without My Daughter"" by Betty Mahmoody is a heroic story about a woman and her daughter's escape from their crazy Iranian husband/father. In the beginning, Betty goes over to Iran to please Moody, her husband. A two week trip turns into a year and half stay. Betty and Mahtob, her daughter, do everything in their power to please Moody and escape. The book was interesting but very dull at some points. The book was very descriptive helping us to imagine the filth that surrounded Betty and Mahtob. If you are a person that loses interest in a book when it begins to get dull, I don't think this book is the book for you. But, if you like adventure, heroic books. This book is for you."
1,American who has lived in Iran,"I am not so surprised by the book - Mahmoody had a bad experience and has the right, albeit ignorant and shallow, to condemn an entire culture and people. What surprises me even more are the thoroughly ignorant reviews written by the readers, most of whom I am sure have never had the privilege to visit a beautiful and ancient country like Iran. We Americans are generally an ignorant lot - the white trash of the world I guess. Most of these reviewers only know the derogatory associations of Islam, Middle East etc, and know nothing of a 2,500 history of a warm and friendly people. Best wishes to them all - and keep reading this type of trash. When vacationing abroad, stick to London, they speak your language and offer McDonald's and Burger King, just what you know and love."
4,Another winner from Multnomah and Robin!,"I just finished Echoes, and I loved it. Wren and KC were interesting and enjoyable people. I feel like I know them. I loved the way Robin used the Brownings poems in the book. What a great idea! I also loved hearing how Jessica,Kyle and Teri were doing. Keep the great books coming Robin!"
1,EasyCat,The EasyCat is too light weight. The buttons did not spring back after being clicked. The product was returned.
1,Weights & measures...,"The obvious evading of the weight of the content struck me immediately, packaged by politicians? Some good reviews, but come on, ""packed in large jars""..."
2,An ambiguous review.,"Samuel Delaney's Trouble on Triton is a somewhat disturbing book from the mid-70's. The Solar System has been colonized, and the various and many moons are in a war with the two colonized planets, Earth and Mars. In Delaney's heterotopia, anyone can find their pleasure by outwardly declaring their sexual preference (or lack thereof), by having said preference adjusted for them, and by switching genders at will. Hunger, homelessness, and lack of anything are pretty much eliminated.In this strange paradise, we meet Bron, a cringingly un-self-aware man who is completely unable to be happy. The book chronicles his wanderings and his pursuit of the object of his alleged love, a performance artist named The Spike.Interesting, well-written, yet also somehow forgettable, I don't think I'd recommend this one unless you're really bored."
4,Nice gloves for the price,"Kept my hands warm on my recent trip to Canada to visit relatives. Pay attention to sizing - they fit as stated. I was happy with mine, they were comfortable and the closure at wrist was helpful in the snow."
4,"Wow! Soothing, Relaxing...Very Suprising Purchase","When I first saw Mia Doi Todd's album listed as a ""similar artist"" when I was buying Alanis Morissette's ""Under Rug Swept"" I really had no interest in buying it. It looked a little too ""out there"" for me...Boy was I wrong. Mia Doi Todd is really talented. I found the music to help me relax after a hard day of work. Track 6 ""Autumn"" sounds like it was on a TV show or a movie trailer or something. I strongly reccommend this album."
4,Wow...Total Shock...I actually really LIKED this one....,"When I first saw Mia Doi Todd's album listed as a ""similar artist"" when I was buying Alanis Morissette's ""Under Rug Swept"" I really had no interest in buying it. It looked a little too ""out there"" for me...Boy was I wrong. Mia Doi Todd is really talented. I found the music to help me relax after a hard day of work. Track 6 ""Autumn"" sounds like it was on a TV show or a movie trailer or something. I strongly reccommend this album."
4,ChamberMusik,If you like Wu you'll like this. A collection of Mc's guest on mainly Buddha Monk produced tracks. A versatile album that will appeal to those fed up with the bile thrown out through the radio.
5,This Book Brought Medicine Into Perspective,"I was initially advised to get this book by a tutor. At first, I thought it was just going to be another review book with a lot of information. But to my suprise, the information is organized on a system basis which is exactly what's on the Step 1. I really think anyone preparing for Step 1 should get this book."
5,Great Product Quickly Delivered,This is another product I ordered for my daughter to be delivered to another state. This received this product quickly. This product is also one that I highly recommend. Both seller and product get five stars.
4,pretty good,I think the book was good but there were so many plot lines that never really end. The main stories good but when you read the PS you find out its really about justine when sara is the main chacter I think the book end in an off key but it was great to see what happened next
2,dumb,This girl didn't really do anything that bad. And it was just unrealistic with the whole parenting situation.
4,The Peacock Preens,"This is a very solid 4 stars. The songs have very good lyrics. They are for the most part softer and slower, but with real feeling that keeps the attention, rather than getting tiresome. Alice is a good singer and her voice blends well with the restrained insturments. This album is definitely not overproduced. It is a dignified album with something to say. That said, the album kinds of runs out of gas toward the end and is maybe feels a bit too long because of it. Had the second half maintained the strength of the first half throughout, I might have given this 5 stars. Some notable tunes:Alabama Boy - excellent thoughtful and moving tune about a boy who's a domestic violence survivor who did not succumb to his bad experiencesLeading with My HeartBlissI'll Start With Me - critique of American consumerismParallel LifeInto the Light"
3,Needs more old pictures,"I liked the book's written history about each neighborhood.However, I would have liked to see more historical pictures showing how the buildings, stores, structures, roads & overall genre of the DC neighborhoods have changed throughout the past century. For example, my Dad was born & raised in DC & describes the U st. Cardozza neighborhood during the 1940's as looking COMPLETELY different than what it is today. It would be nice to look at some of that history at the ever changing landscape of my city."
4,Very nice product,"The product does exactly what the description says....and does it very well. I recieve calls on my office phone and cell phone all day and can easily answer either without being tied to a cord or having to hold my cell phone to my ear with my shoulder and than have to switch to the other reciever. I plugged it in and used it right away without reading the instructions. I still have not read them and have no problem. I do wish the battery lasted a little longer. But than again I am on it all day, usually 7 hours before I get static. If the earpiece was a little smaller I would like it more as well but no real complaints here. I would recommend it for anyone who gets office phone calls and cell phone calls and needs to use their hands for writing or a keyboard."
3,Moderately Funny Send-Up,"Moderately funny send-up of Arabs and Islam that could be taken the wrong way if one were so inclined. The hero is a screenwriter hired to write a film about the life of Mohammed, the prophet of Islam (a problem when representations of the prophet are forbidden). Grenier succeeds in writing imaginatively about the antics of the international crew and their trials as they bounce around the Middle East as funding gets pulled out from under them time and again by various governments. Not nearly as compelling or amusing as Ray Connolly's Shadows on a Wall but interesting in its own way, especially for Middle Eastern buffs. Includes obligatory hijacking and hostage taking."
2,Disappointing,"After seeing Joy Fielding books on store shelves for a long time, I finally bought one, but if Mad River Road is typical of her stories, I won't be buying any more.The one thing she has going is the suspense. Yes, the story is plenty suspenseful, enough foreboding of future events to keep the pages turning. But the problem is, I don't LIKE any of the characters. The women make lifelong bad decisions and then we're supposed to think of them as victims? We're supposed to worry for them? Jamie, in particular, verges on criminally stupid. Emma is irresponsible, Lily is better but none of them provoke my concern, none really make me cheer them on. I truly do not understand why this is a bestseller. I'm guessing it's riding on the coattails of some of Joy Fielding's earlier books. Which I probably won't read."
3,"To quote Bette Davis ""What a dump""","So totally average that I am tempted to not leave a review---but here goes.Did I read the same book that the 5 star reviewers read? The story line is fairly engaging, but the characters are very one dimensional and we plod on to the eventual ""you-can-see-it-coming-a-mile-away""somewhat combustible ending. There is not much suspense because you really don't like the characters very well. The villain is a creepy psycho and the females Jamie, Lily and Emma are just plain dull.I wouldn't read this again for money."
5,Excellent.,"I'm on a Joy Fielding binge at the moment and most often wonder a bit about her women who tend to act much differently than I would or I would expect them to, so I have never given any of her books a 5/5 - UNTIL I READ THIS ONE. Cover to cover a spellbinding read, great characters, the story neatly finishes up. And the usual surprise is included. Hope the next one I read is just as good."
3,"only for collectors, for but 2 or 3 tracks","I only give this 3 stars because it links in well to The Kinks' golden years. God's Children and Way Love Used To Be make it worth buying, but it is thin after that (in my view). This is a Kinks fan purchase, not a starting point (Village Green, Arthur, Face to Face better places to start)"
3,decent but not great,"This headset is passable, although I found that the volume was less than ideal. I returned it for a Motorola H700, and am much more satisfied with the volume issue. Also note that although there are 3rd party volume workarounds (e.g., Volumecare) to increase volume for the Treo 700p (which I own), they are generally not useful except when applied to a wired headset."
3,Not the best headset,"I love bluetooth, but am looking for a better headset.The most annoying feature is the one button for every thing.I'll put it in my bag, and if it gets bumped, it redials the last person I called-without my knowing it.I've had several people say I called them and they could hear me talking in the background.If I turn it off, it takes too long to turn it on when a call comes in. It also seems to take a while to answer a call and at times, doesn't."
3,Ok,"This is my first bluetooth wireless headset purchase. I saw the other reviews on this website and thought that I would give the product a try. I've had it for a week now, and would say it's just ok. Static occurs probably 75% of the time, however the static is bearable, but still annoying. The one button does make answering calls difficult. I had to practice calling myself several times to figure it out. Let's just say I hung up on accident more than once. The product is not bad if you have a TREO 650, having another charger is a major plus. So i figure at $60, I'm getting a $30 wireless headset and a $30 travel charger. I can live with that.The good:CheapEasy to figure outSame charger as Treo 650good for first time bluetooth user.The bad:Static on occasion (not clear 100% of the time)Must learn how to answer callsI don't like the redial function, wish I could disable.Not good for veteran bluetooth user."
3,HEADSET REVIEW,"I have received the product with a problem in the microphone, the persons hear me but I could not hear them.The Palm One customer service answer my Inquiry and solve the problem sending a nother one new.Thanks"
1,Treo Headset letDown,"A charge doesn't last long and it sometimes won't work at all. Flimsy, cheap-like."
1,Need QC and QA,"I was totally dissapointed when I got this product. First, I got less than one pound of the prodcut. I happen to have food scale at home and was surprised it's about a quarter less. Look at the picture and the product is full-- but the way I got it was mostly empty and a lot of plastic. I have no idea why."
3,A mixed review,"I really was looking forward to hearing this double cd, in fact I opted for this rather than picking up his new release ""shaman"". Disc One is superb, all the old hits are there from the first three albums and beautifully remastered. However the second cd while having a number of great slower tunes and some jazz influences, in the middle, it gets bogged down with some very dated 80's stuff with electric drums- yechh.I will probably burn disc 2 eliminating 5 songs and will have a very nice package as a result. If you are looking for hits then I would suggest buying his first three remastered or get the two greatest hits packages. Disc one 5pts, Disc two 3pts."
1,stupid!,"I bought this book for a Christmas gift from the reviews it sounded good, but when it arrived I have since debated if I should give it as a gift as it is just plain stupid. I am sorry but one of the facts I know is just wrong, it says a man was in charge of the western Pennsylvania mafia, when he was based in the east not far from where I live. So if they are wrong on that what else are they wrong on???? just plain stupid the layout and everything, save your money and look at another mafia book."
3,A page turner,Jerome accidentally sleeps with his finance's twin sister on his wedding day. He soon learns of his finance (Denise) and her twin's (Dana) deceitful plan and he conjures his own plan that will change everyone lives.Although the ending was predictable it was a good story.Story does contain ménage and anal sex scenes.Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes
5,Incredible!!!,My girlfriend and I started reading Mistaken Identity yesterday and stayed up last night until we had finished it. What a ride! So very clever and the twists and turns were nonstop. We could hardly wait to delve into the next chapters we were so hooked on the read.A must read for all adults with a good sense of humor.
4,Sizzling Pages,This book Ms. Hubbard wrote is not your typical romance novel. It goes beyond the edges of risks and takes you to a sensual place. The books taps into the fantasy some women have. The book is not for the faint of heart or conservative prudes. LOL. So fasten your seatbelt cause this ride will not be smooth.
5,Just as good as previous version,"I didn't buy the latest version, and I'm glad I didn't because it's about the same when I compared them. Be prepared for this to be dense, and only black and white pics. If you are looking for animated, fun pictures this is not the book for you. For my purposes this book is very straightforward despite it being dense."
4,great in my dorm room!,"this is a sweet coffee maker for a dorm room. it is small [this is a plus, as coffe makers arent allowed in my dorm!], and has a cup WITH A LID [great to take to class]. one full cup is ready in 2-3 mins!! it is sort of noisy, thats my only complaint. and the black color makes it harder to clean when dirty. else, is great! imagine all the money saved instead of buying coffee twice a day from starbucks!!"
4,coffee maker,I love this coffee maker took forever to find something simple to just heat up the water that didn't take up 1/2 my counter. Had it a few months and its exactly what I needed works great. An auto shutoff would be nice but then the price goes up and more things to break. This is simple just the way I like it.
4,personal coffeemaker toastess,I love this coffee maker! My family is always on the go at different times of the day. Everyone can make their own coffee by personal tastes. We love the size of the brew basket and it is indestructible! Thank you so very much for a wondeerful product!
2,"Lifeless sound, lifeless performance","I am a fan of Gould (owning and liking many of his CDs) but occasionally he does disappoint. The Marcello concert is a complete disaster -- dry, emotionless performance as if played by a robot (you literally wouldn't tell the difference from a pre-programmed computer). Gould conveys none of the beauty and sensuality of this music. Reminds me of the terrible thing he has done to Bach's prelude #8 in Clavier I. The CD has generally poor, flat sound."
3,Duran Duran Remixes CD,"I have been looking for this CD set for a really long time ever since a sailor from a previous ship played The Reflex (Dance Mix) on a cassette he made (long before people can make their own CD-Rs). You will like all the remixes on the CD. But, there is a separate CD for New Moon On Monday (Extended Mix) and it's an enhanced CD. Neither my portable CD player or the CD player on my computer can play it. And I'm pretty sure it's a good CD. If anyone knows what I could play this ""I know it's going to be a great"" CD, please let me know."
5,Essential CD for Big Band,This was recommended by a friend who has over 2000 jazz CD's. He said that this is a must have and I agree completely.I love this CD and my wife and I listen to it often.
4,SCOOTER LIKES HIS BED,MY GREAT DANE LIKES HIS NEW ORTHOPEDIC BED. I ONLY WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LARGER. PART OF HIS LEGS ARE ON THE FLOOR. I THINK HE JUST NEEDS A TWIN BED!!!
3,"Petra Jean Phillipson, Extended play .","Only 4 songs,when i herd her sing with the Freestylers, i told you so,with such strong voice , i must check her out, some songs are ok, the others drag a little."
2,Makes good tea BUT SPILLS EVERYWHERE!!!!!!,This tea maker from Mr. Coffee makes wonderful tea. BUT it is ALWAYS spilling when pouring into a glass. VERY messy little carafe. I highly recommend NOT purchasing this model. I am very surpised this model even passed inspection.
1,Fielding Disappears,"Like many other reviewers I regret the passing of the Stats Baseball Handbooks, since I had stopped buying the Register after I discovered the Handbook. I therefore rather reluctantly bought the Register this year thinking the promised addition of On-base and slugging percentages would at least make the new Register better than the old ones. I was very disappointed, though, to find out that room had been created for OBP and Slug by dumping putouts and assists from the fielding stats. One of the few advantages the older Registers had was that they did not ignore a player's yearly fielding stats. (The Stats Handbook only provided them for the past season.)"
3,"Baseball Register, then and now","The stats are there, but the clarity isn't. The Baseball Register of the past--the 1950s and 1960s--displayed the trades individually, with asterisks, anchors, and letters, cited every trade separately, making it easier for the reader to know the context of the trade.The book isn't what it was--the information is packed in, in an apparent attempt to save money and space. There are no photos, which there used to be; the paper is flat, not glossy. In truth, The Sporting News is deliberately publishing a product inferior to that which it delivered 40 years ago, and that is too bad."
1,A complete mess...,"Sounds like rejects from the cutting room floor of any of his previous records. Some excellent musical moments, very brief, that are ruined by a lack of any kind of development. It's just thrown together. He seems overwhelmed by his own ego and thinking anything he puts to tape is a work of genius. Well, ""Incantations"" was. This isn't."
5,One of the Best in the Century!!!!,Oh!!!What can i say more tha has not yet told??I think that this album is one of the best of oldfield's along with Ommadawn and for sure one of the most under rated albums in music.
2,some cacophonous nonsense,"It appears as though Oldfield tried to patch together fragments of disparate pieces that he failed to develop into actual songs. As someone (Oldfield) who usually has a solid grasp on melody and song development there is precious little that's memorable here. On the rare instance where it seems he's on to something he abruptly switches gears into some cacophonous nonsense. What do I remember when this disc is over and done? That odd, annoying, spasmodic voice ""happy."" That's all I remember."
1,why can't i give it zero stars?,"(...) Thank god I didn't buy it, someone loaned it to me (who had in turn gotten it from someone else). One track, an hour long....not that there is anything wrong with that, just that its unlistenable boring ""mood music."" The only mood it inspires in me is suicidal."
3,Product just OK,Product has all of the qualities of Black Strap molassas but has a taste of diesel fuel exhaust but I do have a sensitive palate
4,Wonderful Volume with lots of profound thought,"Except for the numerous passages in Latin which are far above my rudimentary understanding of the language, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The underlying themes went far beyond the apparent murders in the monastery. The writing is at times scholarly but clear and profound. This does not negate the author's skill at presenting a good and engaging story. I enjoyed the movie but the book far surpasses it. I will confess visualizing Sean Connery every time the character William of Baskerville appears."
5,Last Page,"""Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus"" literally means ""the rose of yesteryear exists in name, we hold naked names."""
5,"Brain candy, a rare treat","This is one of the best books I have read in years! It is like candy for the brain. Reading it was a pleasure. Eco has carefully crafted the story with several layers of detail. Read it as a detective story. Read it as a narrative on Middle Ages history. Read it as a parable describing the search for knowledge. The book speaks on many levels and most readers (especially those who love books) will find this book has much to say. I would also recommend getting the Key to The Name of the Rose, a useful text that will shed light on some of the more subtle aspects of the narrative; but read the first hundred pages before buying the key. If you like the book the key will only enhance the experience (and if you don't like the book the key will probably only serve to remind you of why you don't like the book). Give yourself plenty of time to read--and do not expect to soak it all in at once. Stories this good should be savoured slowly."
4,A contemporary classic,"Deftly translated, superbly crafted and elegantly written, this is a splendid literary blockbuster. Eco marvellously displays his wealth of erudition in this towering contemporay classic."
4,You will need time...,"A classic! Interesting, exquisitely written, complex. Because of these you will need to have some free time on your hands to enjoy it thoroughly."
2,Not up to expectations,"While I found Eco's writing to be quite good, the book fell short of my expectations as a mystery novel. It seemed to move too slowly, and digress way too often. I had read reviews suggesting that the book is a mystery for history lovers, but that statement should be amended to only include the history of religion."
3,Labyrinthine,"I greatly preferred Eco's novel Foucault's Pendulum, maybe because it doesnt worry about being obscure and highbrow. However, with The Name of the Rose, it seems like Eco tries to present a long-past world to uneducated readers. The portrayal of the inner politics of late Medieval Christendom is illuminating but the overabundance of characters with similar names and religious sects leaves the reader confused and without direction."
4,When you listen with your soul the cd is very powerful.,I think that Sarah Mclachlan's cd surrfacing is a treat because you can relate to it on a different level of enjoyment. If one can feel the pain or the happiness I think that it will help you enjoy the songs.
2,pleasant but flawed,"A pleasant read, but Ms. Buck has some homework to do. First let me mention her command of English, or lack thereof. At times we know what word she meant, even when she apparently does not. Unexceptional, for example, is not the same as unexceptionable, nor is credible, at all the same as creditable. After a few of these, one begins to wonder what she does mean. Then, dear Ms. Buck, allow me to offer a piece of advice: there is no surer route to tedium than to tell everything. The Chester houseparty went on for weeks, but after a few pages detailing who sat beside whom to no apparant purpose, most readers must be willing to pack up and go home. That said, I ought to allow that there is a credible love story here, a young woman has jilted an unexceptionable young man whom, much to her credit, she now comes to regard with quite exceptional tenderness. What I found exceptinable, was the amount of tedium en route."
5,excellent!!,"Just completed 500 miles from southern France over the Pyrenee Mtns to Santiago Spain. Wearing Merrell Ventilators and Seal Skinz when it was raining. My boots were soaked inside a couple of times but my feet stayed dry. So, no softened skin or blisters. My feet did sweat a little more than usual but probably not more than on a hot summer day with a pair of liners and merino wool socks. I would highly recommend."
5,so far so good,i just got them today after about 5 days wait so i go camping a lot they should come in handy they also go up to my knees great :)
1,Did not work!,"Installed item, with great effort, Electroline EDA-2800 did not work. All my TV's had no signal. Rechecked all my connections still no signal. Removed item and reinstalled my old unit. It worked ok. Returned Electroline EDA-2800, still waiting for a refund."
2,Wish it had subtitles,"Wanted to like it,get thru it, but couldn't. I prefer most British films with subtitles cause my hearing isn't the best and here with all the noise of combat on top of the accents I found it impossible to understand what was being said. My rule is--if I can't understand it I let it go and watch something else which is a shame cause the Iraq War from a Great Britian perspective is why I bought this DVD. If your hearing is top notch--great, get this and enjoy. If it isn't like mine, don't purchase this DVD."
3,Enochic influence,"The book of Enoch, while not in the traditional Western Christian Canon, is in the Canon of the Coptic church. This book tells of its influence as a first century BC text. It is an interesting read, but not as good as some of Barker's other books."
4,Understanding chemicals,"Dr. Patricia Frank's revision of Alice Ottoboni's classic work on everyday poisons is a welcome addition to the field of literature about chemicals and the harm they may cause. It is written for the lay person and brings clarity to a subject that is so often adopted by scare-mongers. While the earlier edition focused on industrial chemicals, Dr. Frank has enlarged its scope to include food additives, cosmetics, drugs, and other products that cause concern to people who are eager to protect themselves and their families from harm. It is rich with examples and wise with advice. Anyone who wants to be smart about chemicals in the home, the workplace, and the environment would benefit from this book."
1,"If I could give this book negative stars, I would","I bought this because I wanted an introduction to toxicology. I should have looked at the authors' credentials more closely before I gave money to these people. One author works for ""a consulting firm . . . that assists companies in the registration of human and veterinary pharmaceutical agents."" In other words, big pharma. The other works for the California Dept of Public Health, in other words a captured regulatory agency. The whole book is just a great example of industry propaganda, systematically underplaying the risks of toxics. A very bad book."
3,"Not ""Like New""","I paid extra to get a copy of this CD that was described as ""Like New."" The CD plays fine, but the case was nasty and broken. It would have made a much better impression to spend the small amount it costs to replace the case before shipping."
4,Definetly worth your money!,"This CD is worth buying. There are very few songs on the CD that I don't like. I especially like ""To Make You Feel my Love"" and ""Chances Are""."
3,Maltose is healthier than Sucrose,"I am trying to avoid sucrose and fructose in my diet. Maltose would make a good sweetener. This product gets me halfway there. Because of the maltodextrin, it does not have the sweetness of high maltose, also the product has its own intrinsic flavor, so you cannot use as a flavor neutral sweetener.The only high maltose vendors I can find are located in China - it would be good to have a US retailer"
1,AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS,"This is not it.All boring tunes and all boring artists like three 6 mafia,Black eyed peas,Nelly,Chris Brown and Kelly clarkson.Unfortunately there is not even a single classic rock song on this horrible cd.Avoid.Get STEPPENWOLF GOLD instead."
3,"now, vol. 22 looks to be a good collection & investment but.....","there are some questionable choices on here. about 5 tracks estimated!!!. check on it, miss new booty, poppin' my collar, i'm in luv wit a stripper, & tonight i wanna cry sould'nt be on here. i would of replaced check on it with robin thicke's ""wanna love you girl"", and i would of replaced miss new booty, poppin my collar, & i'm in luv wit a stripper with busta rhyme's ""touch it(remix)"", t.i.'s ""why u wanna"", & pussycat dolls ""beep"". jamie foxx's ""unpredictable"" should of been on here as well. i can certainly do without keith urban's tonight i wanna cry. that should of been replaced with something else, like afi's ""miss murder"" or red hot chili pepper's ""dani california"". as a matter of fact, both of those should of been added to the list. other than that, this disc is good and well worth the time & money. get it."
2,TOO MUCH RAP,"I LOVE THE NOW SERIES BUT NOT NOW 21. NOW 21 IS TOO MUCH RAP. I LIKE NELLY ""GRILLZ"" BUT NONE OF THE OTHER RAP ON THIS CD. AND I THINK IT'S MESSED UP THAT ONLY ONE COUNTRY SONG IS ON THRERE. NOW USED TO BE ALL POP LIKE 'NSYNC AND BACKSTREET BOYS. WHAT HAPPENED?"
4,Good overall source for graphics,"A good source for an introduction into design drawing. As with all Ching books, simple and clean graphics go along with the text to help ensure the reader grasps the concepts being explained.Definitely recommend."
1,Haggerty's curse,I expected it to be a true story about the Donegal gene. And it gave me no info at all.
5,Exquisite,here is the roadmap to a floral and completely sensual landscape. Music that envelopes you like a fragrance and takes you to someplace more infinite and expansive. Beautiful...haunting...the vocals are like velvet and hard to resist. Enjoy.
2,good and bad,"Ive always been into change... i like to pay with cash and i keep my change because it builds up. i would look for wallets that have a coin slot... which results in a one inch in lump in my back pocket. this coin pouch is the perfect solution. its slim, can slide nicely in and out of my pockets.I ordered excited for 5... i promised my girlfriends aunts each one.. they like them too. i only received one in my package... and it was packaged as a single unit. I call amazon, they were helpful, but since they were a ""third party"" they couldnt do much. they refunded me two (2) dollars for the ""missing items"" ...whatever. product itself worthy of 5 stars."
4,Plastic Squeeze coin holder,"Very retro, just what my 16 yo son wanted! Product is easiest to open if coin holder is slightly filled with coins, Seller sent product extremely quickly."
4,I like it,"I was hoping for thicker version,sometimes when I bought this at a store,it was more thicker and lasts much longer."
3,Poor Ending,"Consider this 300 pages of good writing and interesting reading and 148 pages of off the wall, out of left field ending that will leave you shaking your head."
3,Not as good as he should be,"Lescroart wanders into areas he doesn't know well enough, to the story's detriment. He also displays a lot of the laziness he's prone to: bad grammar, often using the wrong word/s and not finding his end product important enough to warrant the effort of finding the right one. The worst failure is that he crams an entire sub-novel (and a lousy one) into the last moments of the book, rather than weaving it in or trimming it down in a competent way. I got the sense that, by the time he'd gotten that far, he just lost interest and wanted to be done with it. It shows."
5,Great story about a great artist,"Georgia sees the world differently. She drew things BIG so people could see how she saw things. She painted everything, statues, skies, flowers, bones, and the Earth. She loved to paint. She did it until she died at the age of 98. Now, her paintings are known all over the world, and through them, we can see what she saw.Why I liked this book - First of all, it has wonderful, I repeat, WONDERFUL, illustrations. Second, I like that it is nonfiction and about an artist I really liked learning about. It is written in the first person of Georgia. I like that. It is unique. I like all the drawings of what she actually painted (cartoon-y versions of her paintings). That was cool. I recommend this book to kids 6+."
4,For all ages,"While the text is simple, the message is suitable for children of all ages. Not just a book for budding artists, but a wonderful book for any child who has contemplated following his or her own dream instead of following the masses. The illustrations are beautiful and the book as a whole is inspiring."
4,DVD Bag,This is a nice bag and it was shipped very quickly. It was listed as a bag for a 7-9 inch DVD player. I have a 9 inch screen Toshiba DVD player and it did not fit in this bag. I would suggest that you include the dimensions of the bag as well so this does not continue to happen.
2,Krups can do better,"This coffee maker is simply cheaply made. I had the same experience as the other reviewer -- the water level indicator is erratic and inaccurate. More to the point, however, is that the part that holds the coffee grounds, which ""swings out"", does so on the cheapest of hinges. Mine just fell off. It is a plastic snap-on unit with one thin metal wire that holds that part of the unit together and serves as a ""spring.""I have had Krups products in the past and generally they are built to last, but this thing is already falling apart and I've had it for 4 months.Krups can do better."
1,Abuse NEVER makes a good romance Novel!!,"After he hits her across the face, they make love about two pages later.I usually really like this author, but I was sadly disappointed in this book."
3,Sweet historical romance,"This book has a mix of romance, mystery and England in 1808. The very sweet romance was a secondary story to the mystery of the why Sebastian killed his best friend in a dual and why someone is trying to kill his father. I would agree this is not my favorite J. Lindsey novel but was quick easy read perfect escape novel. If you enjoy historical romance novels check out `A Loving Scoundrel' by Johanna Lindsey and `Mightier than the Sword' by Peggy Waide."
2,tame,OK. The writing is obviously NOT Johanna Lindsey's style. There are just too many coincidences replacing an actual plot. There is no sense of the time period that Lindsey could embroider into her story. The humor is silly. The characters are just plain plain! The romance is shallow where you expect steam to rise from the pages -- if you read her earlier work.
3,interesting read,"Lady Margaret Landor remembers Sebastian Townshend as a tall, dashing, and charming bachelor. Never did she dream that one day she would hire him to save his father. Although Sebastian Townshend has forged a new identity, Maggie is certain he will come home, but Sebastian Townshend has vowed never to return to England.His own father banished him. His heartbreaking exile was the result of a tragic duel - a duel his father, the Earl of Edgewood, cautioned against - emphatically! Now living on the continent, Sebastian Townshend is 'The Raven' - a deadly mercenary and Lady Margaret Landor needs his help.Both characters are so caught up in the identities that they've created for themselves to be honest about how they truly feel for each other."
4,"Liked the game, loved the music.","The music from this soundtrack gets my imagination goin'. From Compy to Sarah to T-rex, 'tis great to play various energetic moods o' music from an old-school game. 'Nuff said."
1,0% success rate,"I've tried several times, using different methods and plants with absolutely no root growth. I don't know what works, but this does NOT."
4,excellent quality,These boots are really sturdy and feel good on my feet. I added a gel insole to help pad them since I am used to wearing sneakers that have much more padding.
4,Haba fish mobile,"I gave this mobile to a friend, and she said it was great, so I'm ordering another one for a colleague. It moves in even slight air currents, and keeps her son fascinated. Very lightweight, no safety issues. Wish I could say more about it, but she and her son are on the other side of the country.(Consider my numerical ratings to be guesses.)"
1,Junk,"Had it repaired once, under warranty. About a year and a half, now it's dead.No more Samsung for me!!!!!!!!!!"
1,TX-3079 is Defective,"One month after purchase, the Samsung Slimfit TX-3079 turned itself off, would not come back on, and had to be repaired. It is now nine months on and now every time there is a bright scene such as the sky or anything white, the entire picture goes way out of focus including on screen menus so you know it not a problem originating with the broadcasters. In addition, the picture has a noticable bowing along the bottom edge. I paid $1000 for this set at BestBuy and I have been ripped off. If there is no resolution, I will not do business with BestBuy or Samsung again. Do not beleive the glowing reviews some have posted. This television is junk period."
3,Not sure if it does anything,"Was hoping for a magic fix to some x10 issues, but this didn't help me out. My house is old, so the wiring is not the best for x10. The coupler might be helping, but there's no way of knowing."
3,A basic look at prophecy,"This book was apparently written for those of us who either want a quick reference to the most common prophetic passages in the Bible or for the new student of eschatology. Being a very short book, it is more suited for a coffee table or a briefcase than on a bookshelf. Dr. Van Impe professes a pre-tribulation rapture of the church, so for those of you who don't believe that scenario, then this book is not for you. This book is also not intended to be a study of much depth but merely scratches the surface of the world of prophecy."
4,"Still Waiting for that one ""Killer"" Album","Like all of Autechre's offerings this has a few outstanding tracks that leave you wishing that they could put together an entire CD where all the songs are of similar caliber. It's not nearly as abstract and non-rhythmic as the other reviews suggest, which is neither good nor bad, just an observation. It's very much in line with the group's other offerings. If hard core abstract techno is what you want then I would recommend ""Scope"" from Nobukazu Takemura."
4,This ain't no easy ride,"EP7 was originally released in two parts but has been put together for our enjoyment and well it takes a bit of getting used to that's for sure! Guzzling, clicky, fizzy computers that at first will only make itself heard better on computers since ( it seems ) that there are encoded sounds that will let itself be known to computers. It's not exactly easy listening for people - in fact people who like Merzbow might enjoy this more than those who liked Incunabula or Amber. But with repeated listening the songs come together and it proves that for all the probing and prodding and poking that Autechre do to the wires of their computer systems, the music comes out in the end. Well worth the slog in the end but don't expect something instantly accessible"
1,ugly trash,"This cd is some kind of joke. Autechre used to be one of the leaders of ambient/idm. Now they just produce this ugly noise. This is not music, it's crap. I have all of Autechre's cd's. But now, after the previous release and this new mess, I will never buy another of their cd's."
4,sureal etheral soundscapes,"Not since listening to captin beefhearts trout mask replica have I listened to something which has challenged my perceptions of music. Autechre have gave me a new hope for music, because they show how to be original yet somehow familiar."
4,"Hard, but good.","EP7 is a far cry from the textured ambience of Incunabula and Amber. It's almost certainly Autechre's most difficult listen yet. Even after repeated listens, I just cannot get my head round the tracks 'left blank' and 'zeiss contarex'. But having said that, 'rpeg' 'ccec' 'squeller' and 'dropp' are all fantastic tracks but you really need a trained ear to be able to appreciate this EP."
3,Dissapointed and a little confused,The cd came in good packaging and good shape however I was very upset to find out that while I payed $13 for the cd it had stickers on it from Half Price bookstore stating that it was only $3.99 Not only this but they shipping was delayed supposedly due to a death in the family. While I understand that is difficult to deal with as I have lost relatives very close to me it is very bad business practice to not at the very least allow a customer to know that due to circumstances that the product would be shipped late. I most likely will not due business with this company in the foreseeable future.
3,Rare CD. Rare Trax.,"This CD was apparently given away in 2003 with editions of a UK magazine called The Observer. It has 4 super-rare tracks found nowhere else. The live version of 'Me, White Noise' features Phil Daniels who played Jimmy in The Who's 1979 movie Quadrophenia. He also narrated the song 'Parklife' on the Blur album of the same name.It also features unique artwork by famed street artist Bansky."
5,Super Tasty!,Great for making a flavorful and refreshing Iced Tea or hot tea with cream and sugar. Super Yumm! The scent alone will draw you in. I like to mix a couple of these Apricot Tea bags with a couple of bags of simple black tea or Oolong tea for a mix and match unique flavor. Try sweetening with honey for a tasty treat!
2,Disappointed,"In order to increase my knowledge of women artists out there, my wife suggested I bought this album, but both she and I unfortunately fell flat on the ground of a dull, boring and monolithic sound that did little justice to the Lilith concept or to the women themselves.More of a 'live sound' would be appreciated in future releases and maybe more than just one song from each artist to create a better unity for each artist's work."
4,In Point...,"One major point of Lilith Fair is to showcase new and emerging female-headed talent, which this CD does quite sucessfully. I found a couple of the songs to be rather tedious (some folk music can be that way), but for the most part this album accomplishes what it set out to do. Kudos to McLachlan and Co. for giving the world a pop version of the Michigan Womens' Festival, something that those of us who cannot get there sorely need."
3,Only Worthwhile For Sarah McLachlan,"The only reason I purchased ""Lilith Fair: A Celebration Of Women In Music"" was because of Sarah McLachlan. Her version of ""Building A Mystery"" is good, although her live version is basically like the album version. Paula Cole doesn't seem to know where to take her ""Mississippi"" song (or however you spell it), and other than McLachlan, all these women are boring to listen to. The real treat on this album is ""Water Is Wide"", sung by The Indigo Girls, Jewel, and Sarah McLachlan. The four women harmonizing at the end is beautiful, but only because it's Sarah's high notes that shine."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this album the day it came out, mostly for the version of Building A Mystery, which sounds like every other live version of that song. I admit that I don't even like most of these artists, but I enjoy every artist when they play live and on this compilation disc of the first Lilith Fair, it just doesn't work. Meredith Brooks' song Wash My Hands is good, but her singing -or lack of- completely ruins it. The only songs on here that are worthwhile are Water Is Wide (gorgeous), Hold Me Jordan, Mississippi, and Wash My Hands."
3,"some good tracks, some pretty strange ones",Some songs that are extremely powerful. Some songs sound like a b**ch with an attitude. The procedes from the CD do benefit a good cause. The songs are very diverse and let you experience some artists that you may never have heard of.
1,Buyer Beware,Although the shoes fit as advertised the pair I received was blemished. The black dye on the left shoe (kiltie and tongue for lack of a better description)was missing. The area was gray.
4,Great product,"Fits perfectly in my 2005 Toyota Prius. Would have given it 5 stars, but I believe it is slightly over priced."
5,Great Stuff,"Mr. Engle has produced a masterful piece of art inspired by one of the greatest inspirations that any artist can have: His daughters.The music is, simultaneously, moving and technically impeccable. This CD is a true fusion of a great artist's love for his daughters and love of music. Musically progressive, this CD goes slightly past my comprehension, making it, amongst other great things, a wonderful learning experience. ""Two Trees"" takes you out of your world and into another, just like art is supposed to. Thank you, Mr. Engle, for the journey."
3,Mind Food for the Malnourished Mind,"Seems to me ""hit"" music is based on a good corporate push and gimmick. Well quite contraire to that rule, Positively Black bring a cosmic fusion of good music and conscious-based lyrics. With serious concepts and smooth delivery (even at break neck speeds) lead m.c. Prince Kharique delivers the ""nightmare on america's street"" with this self produced release. This album is a wonderful addition to any Hip Hop head or black upliftment collector. They had a video for the cut ""Escape From Reality"".Playlist:1. SOLDIER AT WAR2. ESCAPE FROM REALITY3. WILDERNESS OF SIN4. NIGHTMARE ON AMERICA STREET5. THINK LIKE YA ENEMY6. POSITIVELY BLACK (U.R.

4,"Outstanding, but overshoots the target audience a bit.","As with all of Jones books I have read, this book instantly grips the reader and creates a solid bond with the main characters. But unlike most of her books, this is a very challenging read! For one thing, there simply is no solid timeline. The reader begins the book at a half-way point, but does not even begin to discover this until chapters and chapters later. Characters are not who, or even what, they seem, and shift without warning. But beyond this, there are deep references not only to Arthurian legend, but also Beowulf. And while it is still enjoyable without the frame of reference provided by knowledge of those times and tales, the reader without it cannot help feeling that they are missing something.All of these tricks do serve to enhance and deepen the story - for the right reader. And that reader is a highly intelligent teenager or adult with an extensive reading background and a love of fantasy and/or science fiction."
2,"Light juvenile reading, fun without a lot of depth","I can't gush about this book as others have but it was fun, if not a little dizzying. Given past reviews, I had high hopes for ""Hexwood"" but the book is slow to get going and the ending was terrible; simply falling apart in its attempt to bring too many plotlines together. Also the characters were rather bland. This book was all over the map but it wasn't terrible and I'm sure that much younger readers may enjoy it."
3,Good like junk food,"One thing I learned from watching The Hills was I can be entertainedby beautiful people that say absolutely nothing funny, interesting, orcompelling. Just fill in the dead spaces between conversation, which aresignificant, with pop music that fits the moment. In fact, if the characterssay nothing it is sometimes that much better. The music makes one imaginethe sum of the parts are far greater than the individuals themselves. Justgive me the fancy back drops,nice restaurnants, and multi-million dollarhomes. Like junk food this feels good, but in retrospect I learnednothing, but again who cares as the empty calories felt good going down."
2,Just read the manga version...,"Maris the Chojo is one of renowned manga artist Ms. Rumiko Takahashi's early works. The original manga version is simple, short, and sweet. Unfortunately, the anime version I'm reviewing now is the exact opposite. While the zany plot is more or less retained, the execution is what kills the MTC anime. Things unfold slowly, and everything just gets so long-winded. There are lots of useless panning through scenes where characters traverse - whether walking on land or flying through space. I marvel at how they managed to extend a very short manga story to a 45-minute anime feature. The art and animation are okay. The overall look and feel are somewhat dated but it's generally not bad."
3,A Masterful Fake,"This movie stirrs a mixed reaction. On one hand, the tragic, no-way-out atmosphere of the Stalinist era is masterfully depicted. On the other hand, I do not believe in the naiveness and purity of the main hero, Kombrig Kotov.Brilliant acting, thou."
4,A Silly Start... Then Morphs Into A Powerful Narrative,"Starts out farcically, foolishly, and tempts you to walk away believing this is an amateurish, silly, foolish movie. Then the primary characters begin to interest you, to intrigue you... and one in particular enchants you. Then you begin to realize the gravity of what is happening, and that this particular story, involving but a few handfuls of characters, is a profound narrative on the madness, brutality inhumanity of Stalin's Soviet empire.(Minor defect: the English subtitles cannot be turned off... somewhat irritating for those that can follow the Russian dialog and don't want the distraction of the subtitles)."
1,They'we chosen the worst movie to give it an Oscar,"Imagine yourself the following plot for the movie: to the house of a high-rank SS/Nazi officer comes a jew. Long time ago he was a first love of the Nazi's wife, and still loves her. And was somewhere abroad, running away in 1933. And meanwhile the Big Nazi was building a bright future for all German people, the jew became the agent of Gestapo, and a right hand of Himmler. And actually has come to arrest the true national-socialist. Does this sound to you believable, or is it totally disgusting?This is about how the story told in Michalkov's movie is related to the true history of Russia in 1930s. Not only the plot is highly unrealistic, the good and bad are really turned upside down. It's a pity, actually, since practically any other movie of Michalkov is quite good. This one is even directed poorly."
1,DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF>>>>,You ever want to forget it. Its been 2 weeks and I can not stop thinking about it. If you have a young daughter DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Every time you play with your daughter you will think of this movie.
5,a music lover from the bay area,This cd is the bomb. I wish there were more out there like it. This truly is the best cd i have ever heard! I love it!
1,busters(nortenos) cant rap,FRESNO COUNTY BULLDOGS SANGER FARMERSIDE!! In time we will be representing in the music business
2,Hulk Rules?,The only songs you will remember from this cd are American Made & I want to be a Hulkamanic. The rest is forgettable. I give this cd a 4 out of 10.
1,In wrestling maybe...,but not in music. Sorry Hulk but this is lame beyond words except for the WCW Hulk Hogan theme which is the one star in my review.
1,British and American Band Classics (Purchased on 12/17/2009),"This CD never arrived. A CD of an entirely different style was sent by mistake. Numerous email from me to the seller remain unanswered. The wrong item did, however, arrive quickly."
5,Debbie Friedman's Best,Debbie Friedman is a master and Renewal of Spirit is my all-time favorite of her albums. I listen to it to for inspiration or if I just want something beautiful to sing along to. Her captivating melodies appeal to young and old alike. My mother listens to it to relax and I play it for my infant to calm him at night. You can't miss with this album.
4,Good,"I thought this was a very sweet book and I enjoyed it a lot. Am I missing something? This is the first and only book of Mary Stewart's I've read. It was very entertaining and the characters were likable and understandable. Maybe this is not a masterpiece, but I very highly recommend it as a feel-good, fun-to-read book. Especially if you don't know much about the Arthurian legends, it's pretty self-explanatory. Definitely, read it."
3,"Good, but not up to Stewarts standards.","Mary Stewart is one of my favorite authors, I have read almost all of her books! So when my mom told me about this book, I grabbed the closest copy and spent the next 2 days reading. It was a decent book and better then some I've read, but I was surprised it was the same person who wrote the wonderful novels The Stormy Petral, Wildfire at Midnight, and my all time favorite The Ivy Tree. I suggest that you read it, just don't buy the hardcover, It's way to $ expensive $ for this kind of writing!"
5,Williams Gold,Another Classic of John Williams scores. It can charm you and scare you at the same time. The last track is the best of all on the CD. A big musical flourish is great for the ending of this sci-fi epic. Who else to direct such a film then Steven Speilberg.
5,Brown: down and dirty,"This early work by Larry Brown is one of his best, a fine example of 20th century American literature. The novel is an intense, gritty and profound examination of the human experience in the modern world. As ususal in Brown's writing, the characters are vivid and very real; they are much like the people who surround us in our daily lives. The characters in Brown's novel are Southerners, but they are also Americans and could be from anywhere in the country, with the possible exception of certain major cities. Dirty Work is indeed a dirty work of art that forces the reader to deal with some very tough questions and hard realities that face people in modern America. It is, perhaps, not for everyone, but if you are looking for the best works of contemporary American literature, this novel, and others by Larry Brown, would be well worth your time."
2,"Good story, but dry in the middle","I read Cleopatra, and absolutly loved it. I even cried at the end, even though I knew what would happen to Cleopatra and Marc Antony. So I was excited to read George's version of Mary Queen of Scots.The story started off interesting, but soon became a drag. I understand Mary spent most of her time in confinement, but she didn't need to spend so much time over those years.I know when I don't care for a book when I am anxious to get to the end...not out of suspense, but out of boredom. Unfortunately, this book was the type I was looking forward to the end because I grew tired of it."
3,Good but long,"Like the Titanic you know how this ends. I enjoyed learning more about Scotland. For me this was the best part, but it was hard keeping up with all the characters.By the end of the book I was ready for them to execute Mary."
2,Get the July 2000 edition instead,This version is just so strange. It looks like it is made up of cheap black and white photocopies of the original book by the same name with a publishing date of July 2000. I'm not sure what the publishers were thinking by making this sad edition--a lot of detail of the photos are lost.
2,"ok printer, has flaws","Has been a reliable printer. I have needed to clean the heads often to keep from having many lines on my pictures. Big downfall is that, after a while, the pages started printing crooked. Pictures and text aren't very sharp either."
4,great,easy to read and informative. this book gave me a good idea on what to expect from the subject. I would highly recommend one reading this book.
1,"Save your money on this one, we were so dissapointed . . .","The only thing that works on this vehicle is the marketing. My 5 year old really wanted this toy and we searched high and low to find it for christmas . . . It seemed so cool, until we tried to fold it up, it was nearly impossible to fold it up correctly. The pieces were so flimsy that they broke. When we finally would get it closed up (to the hummer)stuff would pop open when we were trying to play with it. This is an inferior product and unfortunatly the company is not fixing it since they are re-marketing it this christmas."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"My 5 yr old son saved his money and waited months to get this toy. What a disappointment it was. After we unfolded it, it was hard to get back togethet(I had to do it). It is made out of cheap plastic and in turn breaks easily. We gave it away quickly and learned that toys such as this do not work as they appear on tv."
1,What a Disappointment!!!,"All my grandson wanted Santa to bring this year was that Hummer H2. So, of course, I got it the first chance I got! He was So excited that Santa remembered! What a frustrating toy not only to assemble but really confusing to put away. The ratings are for 3 yrs and above. That alone should be changed. The front of the truck keeps coming apart from the body of the truck. And when he tries to push it around as a vehicle, his hands hit the release buttons to unfold the truck and the whole thing comes apart. What a big disappointment but thank goodness I kept the box and receipt! Needless to say, like the person from PA, I have returned it to the store as well."
4,Rightly sized for 34T,"This worked very well for rear gears with 34T (there is still a good inch all around). The 3-prong connectors are versatile for spoke hubs, but just adequate, as they seem to allow the unpronged area to raise up just enough to want to rub on the inside of the freewheel when freespinning. Have had no problems with them coming unhooked though to date. Wish it was easier to find metal protectors still, as they simply just screwed around mounting hub (and were chrome.) Welcome to plasticville, these are not things you want to take the trouble to replace if they come off or break!"
3,not for everyone (but I like it too),"stripped down bare irish offering. June Tabor's voice is rich and full of emotion...but the production is poor and threadbare. ""the Scarecrow"" is one of my favorite all time songs..sad and an interesting mix of guitar and cello. ""the barmaids song"" is also excellent. Most all of the songs are somber odes or ballads. Very traditional Irish stuff. The acapella songs are a little much. Overall a moody, dark cd that requires patience and...geez I guess one of those ""I vant to be alone"" moods."
3,Here we go again!!,The sweet girls from Larvik are back again. They released an album here in Norway some years ago. I think that was better than the new. but it isn't bad at all!!
3,Stiff Robert Ludlum,"Two months of off-on reading, mostly at bedtime yet The Bancroft Strategy didn't deprive me of sleep. Because the story was so lengthly I'll be concise.Suspenseful, mysterious, murderous; romancing, spying, globe hopping; sometimes exotic; muscular handsome men, well appointed woman, genius philanthropic child; deceitful, lecherous, and cunning expose into the world of physical and digital espionage politics and more, more and more deceit, murder and lying.Even though I'd figured out the ending a quarter way through the multifaceted plotting, I enjoyed absorbing the entire novel. The epilogue was a little mushy but I'd expected that also.If you like what I'd described above go for the read. If you want a more reality based spy adventure, read my novel DUBROVNIK. It's available as an eBook at amazon.com."
5,A twist and turn adventure,I really enjoyed this book and will recommend it to my friends. I didn't see the ending coming. The minute I thought I had the plot down they twisted it. If you like this genre of 'spy action' books then I you will get your money's worth.
3,Unsure Ending,"The book had a most vivid narration and it was exciting in many ways up and until the end. The ending for me was a bit predictable as to the identity of Genesis and I had that figured out about halfway through the book. I was disappointed in the ending somewhat as it left some holes or rather some unexplained non-closure items with the legendary field agent, Todd Belknap that conveyed his character to be weak in the end showing a dramatic inconsistency as Belknap was so strong throughout the plot line of this novel. It was as if someone else stepped in and wrote the ending and ran out of runway with ""I am woman hear me roar"". If I knew how it would of ended, I may not have even started reading it. Attention! Tom Cain, Author of ""The Accident Man"", we need your new book, Part II: ""The Survivor"", and in a hurry!"
2,small cart,"I did not realize how short this table was, did not work well with the TV we have but ended up using it as a shelf for something else. This cart is probably good if you have a tv in a childs room and the child watches tv from the floor, otherwise inconvenient."
5,Ideal to use abroad,"I do travel the States a lot (I am from Germany), and I've often been looking for a cookbook, which would give me some of the recipes for foods I enjoyed in the States. Unfortunately, modern (standard) foods tend to be so much different in either country, that good results are often hard to achieve with more modern American cookbooks. But, the type of ingredients listed in the original edition are much easier to comply with here.I can strongly recommend this ""old"" edition to anyone, attempting American cooking in countries, where food standards have a taken a course different from the States in the last 50 years."
3,Disappointed,I bought this book because a lot of people said it was a great beginner book. I have never liked betty crocker books because they are old fashioned and I have enough trouble understanding cookbook lingo of my generation. The bakery sectioned seemed good but I don't think I want to cook anything in the dinner sections. I also bought the healthy college cookbook was perfect for a beginner like me.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this Betty Crocker cook book with high expectations. I was very disappointed in it's layout. The print is very small. I expected more color photography pictures, there were not enough in my opinion. Overall this cook book has a very congested visual to it."
5,"betty crocker, purchased from amazon","the betty crocker cook book was everything i remembered from the early 1950's. i lost mine a lot of years ago and missed it a lot. i am so glad you got it for me again. thank you so much. it has everything in it a person would want. especially ""old timers like me."" thank you again. sincerely alice giese"
5,What a great help!,"Good Old fashioned cooking!!! lot's of ideas and tips! I have my mom""s original one but has been used so much I needed a new one to see some pages that are worn and stained!!"
5,Made me wish I could visit,This is a marvelous DVD (originally aired on the History Channel) that gives you all kinds of interesting information about the twin towers. I really regret that I never was able to go New York and see the World Trade Center for myself. It truly was an amazing building inside and out. One of the sections has a man discussing that the tower could tolerate the impact of an airliner - and if you think about it - it did. It was the fire and heat that took the building down - so he was right.
2,Small internal diameter,When i received these i found that the internal diameter of the hose was about half the size of of those that came with the washer and dryer I just purchased. The smaller diameter added time to the wash cycles. The braid on the hose was not tight and I was concerned it would wear. Other hoses of this type have a clear vinyl coating. I returned these and received a quick refund; as usual.
5,Brilliant Story to Superlative Film,"""Brokeback Mountain"", as a story, is a miracle of concision and psychological insight. As a screenplay, it is a model in the art of adaptation and richly merits its Oscar. This dual text belongs in the library of every aspiring screenwriter and every serious filmgoer."
5,Powerful!,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone! This book has the original story, the screen play & three essays by Annie Proulx, Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana. As another review stated, I would have loved to read an essay by Ang Lee about his process of making the movie! But no complaints! A great read!"
4,Good Info.,"Good reading and the information was just as good. When your shooting Trap and Skeet you need all the help you can get.Thanks James,Bubba"
1,Terrible piece of garbage!,"I read most of the one star reviews, and my review is the same as theirs. Same problems as everyone else. Ink runs out ($40 to replace) like I am printing tons of pages, and I just replaced the black ink because it told me it ran out- and now it won't print black and white documents because the three color cartridges are ""empty"" Bull! BUY ANOTHER BRAND EPSON=GARBAGE!!!This is the third Epson printer I have had issues with. They DID replace one for free, but come on. Three strikes and you are out!"
2,Either print or copy...,"My Epson CX4800 gets stuck on Copy mode and then can not go back into Printer mode. It will be plugged into the computer and just doesn't recognize the USB connection. When you can get it to work, the print quality is good (but slow). Copier quality is good, but only have two options: color or b&w. It also goes through A LOT of ink."
1,Avoid this Printer,"There are two problems with this printer and the other Epson CX models. First, the printer will not operate if any ink cartridge is empty. If the black cartridge is full, and any other cartridge is empty it will not operate even if you want to print in black only.Second, these models have a tendency to clog from ink residue if you don't run cleaning cycles after each use, which exhaust your ink supply. This is a complete waste of ink and an expensive maintenance issue."
1,Feel Like Gambling? Buy This Printer.,"I just threw away an Epson CX5400, which is very similar to this CX4800. It stopped printing due to a design defect - an ink clog that occurs in a tube that is very difficult to fix. The bottom line is, it will last 1-2 years if you're lucky. Whereas an HP or Canon will last for many years longer.If you don't believe me, see the reviews for the CX5400, which has been out longer and has had time to accumulate a lot of reviews."
1,It's an Ink Monster,"I hardly use the printer, but it seemed everytime I wanted to use it it asked for Ink. I bought 2 packs worth $30 each in last 1 year and I hardly printed 15-20 pages, I don't know what to say, but i'm going to put it for Trash next Wednesday..."
3,"cheap, works fine, but it is annoying.","This printer is fine. It's cheap and scans. What more could you want for the price. I am annoyed that if one of the color cartridges runs out of ink I cannot print in black and white, but it's working. My last HP stopped working after a couple of years. My original Epson was fantastic. I guess I just need to get comfortable with the idea of buying a new printer every two years?"
3,The Authentic Catholic Woman,"The book is good if you are married, but if you are single I would skip it."
1,Unreliable machine,"I have purchased two of these coffee makers in the past year, and both failed. I just bought a Mr. Coffee machine as a change of pace.In both cases, the microchip/display in the Krups coffee makers failed and I couldn't get the machine to brew coffee. They just blinked ""8888"" plus other symbols, and no matter what I did I couldn't get the machine to reset and work. I tried unplugging the machine, pushing single and multiple buttons simultaneously, whacking the machine with my hand, etc. If there were a CLT-ALT-DEL option, then maybe I could reset and start over.I now have two Krups glass decanters if anyone wants them."
2,Not like my old one,"I bought this unit after having our previous Krups last 8-10 years. Aside from the poorly design water reservoir and water level indicator which the two combined make for a lovely time trying to fill each morning, I think my coffee is coming out weaker than I care for. I believe it has to do with the fast brewing that comes from the 1100W element. The coffee maker is marketed as having ""Cascading brew head delivers a shower of hot water to ensure even flavor extraction"". The head cascades a shower less than 40% of the total area of coffee, even for just a 4cup brew, and the speed of the brew combines for a weaker cup.Increasing the amount of coffee would only increase the volume of grind that falls outside of this shower. Tomorrow I am going to try the 1-3c setting to slow it down. If it doesn't brew what I have come to expect in a strong bold cup of coffee, I'm taking it back."
1,Avoid this one - it is junk,"I brought this coffee maker home less than six months ago. Right from the beginning I was disappointed. Programming the coffee maker was difficult and I am usually fairly good at these kind of things.The coffee pot lid always seemed cheap to me. The lid was made to come off in order to wash it, but after six months the thing was falling off quite easily.The bubble in the measuring tube was a constant annoyance, so it was difficult to determine exactly how much water was it the reservior.What made me throw this piece of junk in the trash was that the handle came off the coffee pot while pouring a cup of coffee on Easter morning. I spent 15 minutes cleaning coffee of the floor, counter, stove top, and side of the refrigerator. Nothing makes one angrier than having to clean up a full pot of spilled coffee first thing on a Sunday morning.DO NOT even consider this one."
2,carafe leaks,"need i say more. The coffeemaker is great to look at, has great features. I love the carafe idea, but IT LEAKS while it is brewing if there is the tiniest bit of coffee ground in the carafe top"
4,Nice coffeemaker!,"I really like this coffeemaker - easy to use, easy to clean - even dings to tell you the coffee is done! My only real complaint is that it's hard to see the clock when you do not have the coffeemaker on."
1,Krupps minor faults are not minor,"I saw the reviews by several people that panned this coffeepot for what seemed like trivial issues. I bought the pot. They are not so trivial. It is virtually impossible to pour coffee without spilling it. If you lift the lid with your thumb to reduce spilling while pouring, the steam can burn your thumb (somehow it gets channeled right to your thumb.) For right handed people, the number of cups in the carafe is on the wrong side. The timer is complex and unless you want to use the timer at exactly the same time every day, you have to not use the timer at all or reprogram every day.The pot had two features that made me replace my old, burned out Braun coffeepot: The 5 hour on feature, and the carafe itself is microwaveable (no metal bands holding the handle to the carafe.) It does make ok coffee, but is sure is messy. My advice - buy another brand. My old Braun was superb compared to this pot."
4,A Good Coffeemaker - minus one star!,"I just received this product recently after sending my old Kitchen Aid Coffeemaker back to the company for the rebate check. Krups FME2 seems like a good coffeemaker, but cause I am used to the LED display of my old Kitchen Aid Coffeemaker, this Krups with the LCD backlit display is alright, but I wish it had LED. You can set the Auto-Shut-Off from 1-5 hours plus you can turn the finished beep off too, if disired. It does make great coffee. Other than the lack of LED display, this is a good coffeemaker and nice to look at too. Works great too!"
2,mediocre coffee maker,"While this is a fast brewer, it doesn't make very good coffee and the programmable features are cheap and awkward to use"
2,The worst programming buttons ever!,"Have had this coffeemaker for about a year, the buttons already don't work. You have to press them 10 times on average to get it to work one time. Finally, the buttons are now failing so we can't program it anymore. Very confusing, and we are intelligent people who've owned many coffee makers in our lifetime. Don't lose the instruction book on this one - you will need it everytime the power goes out or you unplug it and have to start from scratch. Of course, that's if you can get the buttons to work."
3,Better than others but sure not like Krups of the past...,"Not the easiest to use features but it makes great coffee. I actually miss the old Krups that had a little less automation but gave one more control. The old glass water level indicator has been replaced by a cheap plastic tube. It kept giving a false reading because of an air bubble inside and then broke off up at the top of the maker. No more air bubble but we have to keep it secured to the maker with Scotch tape. They just don't make things like they used to but the prices keep going up, don't they? Too bad because I think Krups is still nicer than some of the alternatives."
5,"Fun, touching book!",I'm a very casual racing fan and absolutely loved this book. I felt like an insider with all the wonderful stories and photos. I just saw the DVD that accompanies the book - definately worth getting! Great footage.
5,So much fun for Family Guy fans.,"I always chuckle when i get Herbert the Pervert draw 4 card or the Meg card that is, yep you guessed, the zero card. It is just like UNO with some different bonus cards like the ""Obey Me"" card that pictures Stewie and when you use it you can see the other person's hand. The case it comes in shaped like Stewie's head has a place for the cards to fit tightly and even slots for two people's decks. This was a gag gift that turned into a lot of fun that comes highly recommended from my family and me."
2,Odd scale on handle does not match directions,The user guide shows an image of how to set to 140 NM but the tool has a scale on one side in fractions for Newton Meter and other side in Inch Pounds. One can not match the directions without some calculations as most tools of this type would have LBS or Foot Pounds on the handle scale. I now wonder if this whole shipment/production batch was a defect in Taiwan dumped on Amazon for sale ?
5,holy toledo !!,"Mike Lewis soared sublime on sax last night at Nomads in Minneapolis, along with the excellent Anthony Cox, and JT Bates.It takes one hell of a lot to keep my interest, and I was floored."
3,battlefront,this game is good at the start but very short. i was expecting more from it. you can complet single player in a few hours and is easy. its anoying when you change your colour to look difrent from the othersd it only last one match then everyone else changes into your colour. theres some pretty god graphics in it too.
3,Too Easy for 13-14 year olds,Gave this as a gift to a 13 year old and he beat it in 6 days. He was appreciative but not challenging enough.
4,great game,I turned 13 this past april and got this game for my PSP. It held my attention for a good week but I really have not played much with it since. But it is a fun game anyway.
3,"Entertaining, not life-changing","There are a few book in my life which I never stop reading--""Walden"" is one, ""The Little Prince"" is one, and ""Our Town"", also by Mr. Wilder, is another. The observations in these books,the lessons from these books, the spirit of these books. . .are ever fresh, ever pertinent.""Theophilus North"" is not one of these books. It is an entertaining read, however. A busybody--Teddie North--visits Newport, RI for a summer and changes the town. He is loved by some; hated by others. There's charm in the book and fun and sex, but not much wisdom.So it is time for me to shelf this book; it is time for me to return to ""Our Town""."
2,A let down arter reading A Very Young Dancer,"I have a copy of A Very Young Dancer which is excellent. My daughter loves it, has me reread it again and again. It is a wonderful depiction of a young ballet dancer. I was hoping The Very Young Actress would be the same quality but it is very disappointing, I wouldn't recommend it. It does not have the depth or detail of A Very Young Dancer."
3,All you need to know:,"Since it was recorded on 3-track 35mm film, the sound quality has been well preserved in The Nutcracker. Serenade for Strings, which is an even older recording, also sounds fine, but Dorati's interpretation is not as good as some of the more recent, more sensitive, more sonorous recordings. The audio splices in The Nutcracker are very obvious sometimes, and really detract from the listening experience once you notice them. Dorati is usually an ideal Tchaikovsky interpreter, as evidenced by his uproarious version of the 1812 Overture, but in this case, he charges through this score with overzealous tempi. The famous Trepak is unsettlingly (and undanceably) fast, and many of the quieter movements barely lack the magical tenderness they deserve.Recommendation: Look elsewhere, if only because of the splices."
3,"Epochal performance, poor remastering","The reviewer below expresses it best. Starker's Mercury set of the suites is, for most cellists, the gold standard. Technically speaking, they are flawless. Artistically speaking there is laser-beam musical understanding that arcs the entire recording. The later RCA recording is even deeper in understanding, but Starker's Bach is akin to Gould's in this regard: you want both the earlier and the later -- they are both that great.What a shame then that shoddy remastering has put these disks into the realm of the unlistenable. Anyone who is intimate with these pieces will notice immediately (as the prior reviewer did) that they are sharp. It is so distracting that I cannot bear to put the disk in the player. A next to criminal moment in the rush to cash in on the LP to CD bonanza!Performance: 5+ Stars; remastering: 0 Stars."
2,It's a crying shame,"It does sound a half-step sharp. I consider Starker, Rostropovich and Colin Carr as the very best modern cellists. This careless remastering implemented in naturally flawed CD format (same applies to DVD's BluRay's etc) is a terrible shame for such wonderful music.Check out ""Bach: Suites for Solo Cello ""Bach: Suites for Solo Cello. Both the recording and performance is betterEnjoy The Music"
2,wrong tital,"While this book does cover the work history of the main character, it could much better be described as how one woman found god. Preachy, sad, and totally lacking Alcott's normal humor and flow."
1,... Awful,This CD was absolutly PAINFUL. Beware future buyers this cd is full of singer wannabe's who have no business singing in the shower let alone on a recorded cd!
4,Great little product,This is a great little dryer rack for food products. It is simple and quick and easy to clean. It arrived on time and it works. What more could you want?
2,small cookies slip through cracks,"IT is nice for larger cookies, but smaller cookies slip through the cracks- wish i had bought a criss cross wire pattern instead. otherwise good product"
4,Space Saver,This is not the first product of this sort that I own but I prefer this one. I don't have a lot of space on my kitchen counters too cool things when I bake and this makes things a whole lot simpler. The tiers are sturdy and it is easy to clean and store
4,Cool racks,"Sturdy enough to securely cool two cake pans on each rack, easy to clean, easy to stack, saves miles of counter space if you like to tackle multiple recipes at once. I hang items like this from a pot rack over my island, these cooling racks aren't exactly suitable for such storage, but in a cabinet, they sit up on the edge well."
3,Good for the price,"As other reviews have noted, the racks are rather flimsy. Some of the coating on the wires is rough in places. My wife uses them just for cookies to help free up counter space, and for that they have been perfect. I wouldn't recommend them for anything to heavy. For the price they are fine, but you are definitely sacrificing sturdiness and overall quality."
2,Don't waste your money,flimsy junk don't waste your time or money on this. for small items the spacing is too far apart and falls over at the slightest touch.
3,Okay,Love the tiers and the size. The grooves between bars are too large and let cookies fall through. Definitely needs cross bars. Would buy different ones.
1,Terrible Racks,"I have no idea what everyone is raving about these racks for. They are poorly made with thin wire gauge, with a large gap between rows that allows food to slip through. The legs on all 3 of my racks collapsed very easily when moved around. When stacked on top of each other the legs would also collapse. Terrible product."
3,great concept with quality issues,"Overall, I'm glad I bought this cooling rack. It folds up to stow away easily and it frees up counter space when I'm cooling several racks worth of baked goods.The major flaw in this product is that the metal is slightly warped on all racks, so that when you set it up, not all of the legs touch the counter/whatever surface you've set it on. This is compounded when you try to fit all three racks together, resulting in a rocking, unstable tower of cooling racks. As long as you're careful and don't bump it, it works sufficiently and I haven't had a problem yet. It's fine for everyday baking, but I would hesitate to put anything really delicate on it.The concept gets five stars, but overall I've rated it three stars due to being fairly flimsy and uneven."
2,"Wilton, really?","Sadly this product does not deserve the Wilton name. I totally expected more from this company. The $10 price is ok for this product, but expect these to be VERY flimsy. I have a set of Pampered Chef racks and I thought they would be similar, since Wilton quality on other products is comparable to PC. REALLY not so. They are smaller and really unstable. I would expect these to have some random never heard of brand on them. They work fine as long as I set them up for my kids to be able to put cookies on, but they've dumped when I've let my kids stack them."
5,The best hip hop album in a long time (lyrically).,"This album is the bomb. Big Pun is a lyrical genuis that keeps coming back with raw lyrics that make you beg for more. I also like the fact that he went back to his roots by rapping in Spanglish. He did alot for the Puerto Rican community and still kept it real. This guy is here to stay and is already ranked among the best MCs of all time. His distinct voice and lyrical style is unparalleled and should not be copied. Keep up the hard work and the money will continue to roll. To my man Fat Joe, you're still the man! Still repping New York to the fullest. Dominicans 4Life!!!!"
5,"Big Pun is a great rapper.if you don't have it ,get it.","BIG PUN IS AWESOME.GET THIS CD.ALL OF HIS HIT SONGS LIKE STILL NOT A PLAYER AND YOU CAME UP ARE ON IT.THIS CD IS GREAT,WITH A CAPITAL G!!!!!!!"
3,I expected it to be better....,"Big Pun can do better than this. ""Still Not A Player"" is the only great song on the CD. He's got a few other good ones. Half of them aren't worth listening to."
5,One the best debut cds ever!!,"This cd joins the list of best debut cds ever. Illmatic, Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, Southernplayalisticadillacmusick, The Chronic, Doe or Die. Big Pun is the greatest of company and has a legitimate claim to the greatest rappers of alltime list."
2,Very disappointed,Our Paha Que Promontory tent arrived this week and we set it up as recommended. What a disappointment. We found the set up instructions less than helpful. They tell you how to deal with the 2 poles but nothing more. It took us at least a half hour to figure out how it all went together. Needless frustration when a few more instructions would have answered the questions. We were 2 stakes short and one of the snaps on the rain fly broke when we were taking it down. The divider fastens in the four corners and the top and is little more than a screen. There is only one small pocket on the tent wall which may hold a pair of glasses and you have to choose whether you use the loft or the room divider as both cannot be up at the same time. The floor looks to be everything they claim but the rest of it doesn't warrant the price. Buy a cheap tent and you at least know what you're getting.
2,BEWARE: Pioneer 8X drive writes these at only 4X,"According to Ritek's site, they are working on getting a full 8X out of Pioneer's DVR-107D and DVR-A07XLA, but they are not there yet. I'm disappointed because I didn't consult their site before buying them and expecting to write at 8X with my Pioneer drive.One would easily assume that a DVD writer, with a big fat 8X on the box (running the latest firmware and software), and media with that same fat 8X on the wrapper would be able to write at 8X, but guess what? Not true!"
2,Ritek Ridata 8X +R only burns at 4X,"Bought a 25-DVD spindle of Ritek Ridata 8X +R DVDs [these have the words ""Ridata"" and ""8X"" on the top side of the DVD]. However, these only burn at 4X on both of my burners. Prodisc and Supermedia 8X DVDs and Ritek 8X -R all burn at 8X. Even Memorex 4X burns at 6X on my burner. Don't waste your time or money on the Ritek Ridata 8X +R DVDs if you want DVDs to burn at 8X."
1,"For beginner, this is not the book to buy.",This book doesn't really help those who really want to air brush cakes. The book needs to be more detailed in how to do and make it more simple. This book would hinder those realy want to air brush due to its complex lay out.
5,Sends chills down your spine,"Wow, how do you describe a musical experience where chills run down your spine? I can't really explain it, but just listen to this Saint Saens and I think you will experience a thrill. The entrance of the organ here has never been as dramatic or overpowering. It is just awesome. You must crank your stereo up loud! The whole symphony comes off just as well and this has to be Paray's finest moment on disc (along with the Suppe overtures also on Mercury). Paray's own Mass is performed well, although it is greatly overshadowed by the Saint Saens. A welcome historic reissue."
4,My Thoughts on the Saint Saens.......,"Symphony #3 is among my favorite pieces, this perfomance conducted by an ""old master,"" Paul Paray. Current conductors in recent recordings have versions that are blah in comparison. I really like Paray's performance, but there are two annoyances that ruin it for me. In the Poco Adagio towards the end, one of the violins slides (sort of glissandos) into the high notes. Towards the end of the Maestoso, a violin makes a prominent sqeaking noise.I thought the Charles Munch BSO version was much superior both in sonics, recording, musicianship, interpration, excitement, emotion, and punch. If Symphony #3 is one of your favorite pieces, it is good to have both versions, both 'old masters,' and you make the comparison yourself. For me, Munch gets 5 stars and Paray gets 4. However, it just boils down to a matter of preference.From the below reviews, I am now going to give a serious listen to the Mass. Thanks for the reviews on that!Thanks, and cheers to all."
1,Does not work,No matter what I do this grider will not turn on. I followed the trouble shooting guide plus a few other tricks I know (I'm an electrical engineer). Still it just sat there doing nothing.Don't waste your money.
3,The mill owner has a name - use it.,"This was the first Carla Kelly I read and it was almost my last, which would have been a great pity as almost every other book of hers I have read gets 5 stars. Why 3 for this one? If the hero was referred to as ""the mill owner"" once or twice that would have been OK, but almost constantly? I wanted to scream. He has a name! use it! It got to be so distracting I almost didn't finish the book and that would have been a pity as the characters are terrific and the plot much better than average.If you reacted the way I did about this book, don't be put off (as I almost was) - try to find other books by Carla Kelly and ENJOY! I highly recommend them."
4,Not the original themes.....but still good,The themes on this CD are not the original recordings. They are all performed and recorded by different artists. But this dosen't keep it from being a great Halloween CD. Some of them almost sound exactly like the original themes to where you can't tell the difference. It's a great CD to get you into the Halloween spirit.
1,You get what you pay for.,"Loved the price, size, styling. But apparent weak workmanship. Couldn't get power. Batteries, except for 1 fresh set for about 1 minute, never worked after I tried 4 fresh sets. The cover for the batteries remains a bit loose, enough that there's no power. For that 1 minute, it worked fine with my Bluetooth-equipment laptop. Sorry Kensington. I'm returning it."
2,"Nice idea, but bad tracking","I have the usb version of this mouse, and love it. Unfortunately, the bluetooth one doesn't have the sensitivity of the usb version, and skips and flies all over the screen. It's very fussy about what surface you use it on. Good thing it didn't cost a fortune to find this out though."
1,quantum mechanical mouse.,"maybe...just maybe, if you're a quantum physicist you can appreciate how the tracking can be at 4 or more different places on your desktop at the same time, but even then you would never be able to write that important article that is going to get you recognized.in short, this mouse's tracking is all over the place. huge disappointment. i don't have time to chase after mouse trails because i'm too busy producing music and the fine adjustments that are required in editing renders this mouse completely ineffective.go for the microsoft bluetooth mouse. much more reliable."
5,Works as great as I thought it would.,This mouse has gone above and beyond. I enjoy using it on a daily basis. Whether I am working on a hard desk or just checking email from bed (yes it works on the bed with no mouse pad) it has proven to be a very useful tool. I haven't even changed the batteries yet. It's a must for anyone who is on the go because of its small size.
1,changed review-now 4 stars,"I've had two of them now and both quit working. The 2nd one was complements of Kensington (after a month of waiting) and within 2 weeks it quit also. The company won't answer my email now (however sent yet another mouse--USB, not bluetooth).Well, I did a little research and found out the problem is that batteries don't last too long on this mouse. I now have two working bluetooth mice and a USB mouse :-)))"
1,Does Not Work,"The tracking on this mouse does not work. After a few minutes of use, it will start to stutter. Even when it is working, it is very laggy. And that's not to mention that the mouse is pretty expensive. Not recommended."
1,Slipshod,The Kensington PilotMouse has Bluetooth on its side. But that's where its advantage begins and ends (Who needs one of those USB nodules hanging out the side of your computer?). I bought this mouse to replace my Mac infrared mouse that worked great until I dropped it on a very hard surface. There is no comparison between the two for control and precision. The Kensington is largely unresponsive on any surface from table top to dedicated mouse pad. I'm off to the Mac store to get the genuine article.
3,Should have bought the 14 in.,"I purchased this saw mostly because the price was right for a floor model bandsaw. It works well but after about 6 months it started knocking. I was talking to a fellow woodworker who had the same saw and he said it was the lower wheel bearing. I have just finished a big project so I'm going to take it in to the service center.I have gotten more and more into bigger projects and now wish I had purchased the 14 inch for several reasons. The table is to small, and is not as heavy duty, it doesn't seem to have enough power at some times, the miter gauge is flimsy, and it doesn't have a fence.For a hobbyist this is a great saw but if you are even considering doing more advanced woodworking get the 14 in."
5,Fun Learning,"I remembered hearing the countries of the world on the Animaniacs when I was in college and so now that I'm homeschooling, wanted to teach my 2nd grader. Found this CD and it was better than I had hoped! She memorized the states & capitals with no pain (reinforced with some interesting flash cards we already had) and sang that particular song at a Talent Show - the audience LOVED it!My favorite song is the Panama Canal. My only warnings are it has some of the now-typical-of-cartoons nastiness to others in the Drops of Rain song and some potty humor in the Traveling Maniacs song. We love this CD!"
5,This album is a classic! Must have,"Davina is one of the best albums of this decade!! It is good to see artist with real talent and not just fancy clothes and cars but no voice (ie Total,Missy Elliott) This is real music all written and arranged by Davina. Oh I forgot, and she kept her publishing rights too! Smart, Very Smart"
1,Does not tie like string,I ordered this thinking that I should use it as a heavy-duty form of string but that is not the case.
5,whistle,"i love this group they are awesome. I like their version of ""Always and forever"" better than HeatWave's the original. I ""Right here next to You"" R&B like this is exinct. Kids of today have nothing to look forward to when it comes to love everything is about drugs,sex,lies,money and disrepecting females and females allowing themselves to be disrepected. Anyway, I highly recommend this to my true R&Bers and those who grew up in the 80's-90's. I also recomend UNV,Hi-five, Kiara, Shai,Troop, New Edition, Boy II Men, Kut Klose, Luther Vandross, II the Extreme, Rude Boys, Surface,Tony Toni Tone, Mint Condition,Ready for the world,Intro,H-town, Portrait, Blackstreet and Guy."
3,good old book,This book covers all the basics of roof framing and using the steel square to frame a roof but I would recommend buying a copy of ROOF FRAMING by H H Siegele. It is more informative and better written. All that being said it is still a good book to add to your collection of construction manuals if you have one.
3,Be Careful of Color,"Just a friendly FYI, I thought this watch had a Blue face. From the listing description as well as the pictures from the site it definitely looked like a very nice deep blue.But when received I was really surprised to find a very shiny purple instead. Blue would've been nice understated color, but purple definitely stands out. So depending on what you want.Otherwise the watch was very nice watch and definitely a great price for something from Tissot. But the color of the face was the deal breaker for me."
4,Very good value,"These clamps are very well made and are a good value for their intended use. I have bar clamps with highly regarded names as well as those that are considered ""cheapos"". If these had been available at the time I bought those others, there would have been no doubt about buying the Denali clamps. They match the quality of much higher priced clamps and the price of the so called bargain clamps. I would highly reccomend these clamps to anyone as additional clamps to their arsenal or, as the only clamps in your shop."
1,Does not stand up to chewing,"My little 10-pound dachshund destroyed this toy the first day. The soft rubber side is easily chewed through to get at the treat. The plastic around the middle can be chewed off in pieces. The fabric loops can also be chewed off. Dogs could potentially choke on all the pieces that can be chewed off this toy. For us, is wasn't worth the money."
1,"This was not ""like new""!","Do not ever advertise a product as ""like new"" when it has been well used, highlighted, and has YOUR NAME written all over the side of the text book. This could be considered false advertising!"
5,pretty much the same as the current 12th edition,i have both this book as well as the current 12th edition. the materiel is pretty much the same as well as the questions after each chapter. the one thing to be careful with is that the questions are in a different order than the current edition but many are the same.
4,Excellent Honors and AP Chemistry Book,"I am using this textbook for my students in both Honors and AP Chemistry in Cupertino, Saratoga, West San Jose and Sunnyvale High schools. It is an excellent balance of explanations and problems. I also suggest this for 1st year college chemistry students.GFSouth Bay Learning Academywww.sbay-academy.com"
3,Chem book,"was well written,as far as definition and basic ideas, but didn't show solid, easy to understand,instructions for working out the formulas. probably will need a second book for that."
2,For Steve Reeves Fans Only,"Sandokan, Pirate of Malaysia was one of Reeves later movies. His build wasn't as massive as it was in his earlier films, but he still looked like a Greek god. Reeves was trying to branch out into adventure films, and turned in a good workman-like performance as Sandokin. These movies were mostly made in Europe and with next to nothing budgets. It's a shame that Reeves was never really given the chance to develop into the star he could have been. He had the drive and charisma, but never realized his potential. Still, he inspired a generation of youngsters to live clean and lift weights. This movie is for Reeves fans only. Sinister Cinema, from whom this purchase was made, is a great place to find old, hard to find videos."
4,"Nice machine, but don't overload it!","It's a cute little bandsaw, but it's motor doesn't have a lot of oomph! And the drive pulley is not well affixed to the motor shaft. Just because a thick chunk of seasoned oak fits under the blade guide doesn't mean that it will cut well...and if you jam the blade, you may wind up freewheeling the drive pulley, which is not well affixed to the motor shaft (I thought I'd fried the motor, but found that the pulley was slipping)"
4,Quite a life,"I found the premise for this book interesting: Heather Mills McCartney wanted to ""set the record straight"" once and for all, dispel any and all rumors about her past. It's a ripe one, all right. In just 33 years, she has lived more than one lifetime's worth of travail, and I personally admire her. Frankly, I think she is the perfect match for Paul McCartney at this stage of his life, and I hope they will be happy together. Hopefully, the press and paparazzi will leave them alone (fat chance...) and they can have some peace and quiet, which she most definitely needs after all she has endured. A pretty good read overall."
4,A Good Read,"When I first started this book I was lost, It seemed so busy, I was having trouble remembering which woman he had what with. But I stayed with it. I found it a nice slow read. I liked the story. It wasn't a hopping page turner but I don't think it was meant to be. It was a good story about love, friendship and growing together. I enjoyed it.DawnMBC"
1,boringggggggg!!!!,very very boring book if u need a sleeping pill here is the cure ..very pointless story and just plain stupid a waste of pages
1,Poor Design,"First problem. Getting the front and back pieces of the case apart without damage was somewhat difficult.Second problem. Putting the two halves of the case back together so that they snap together without damage is also more difficult than it seems it should be.Third (and most serious) problem. Although it's possible to operate the Zen without removing it from the protective case, the design of the case interferes with the proper operation of the unit. Pressing the Back button on the Zen activated the Play/Pause button instead. This happens because the plastic tab on the case that should depress the Back button on the Zen is offset from where it should be; so the wrong button gets pushed. You can fiddle with the case and the Zen to get things lined up, but they won't stay aligned.Because of these problems, I would not recommend this product."
2,Sorry Delta...,"Nothing personal,but Delta dropped the ball on this one.It will make a true mortise cut,but adjusting the chisel with the auger bit is a lot a work.I purchased this tool hoping to save some work.Tends to overheat.I'm a casual user of this tool.The Idea is wonderful,but needs some re-engineering."
4,Delta Mortising Attachment,This set appears to be good quality and set up is easy enough.It requires bit sets with 5/8 shoulder and those appear to be mostly delta bits. The Grizzly bits have 3/4 inch shoulders and do not fit.I am returning this item and ordering the delta set that comes with 4 bit sets.It would help if the descriptions of the bits and attachments included the sholder size requirement for the bit sets.
4,"Superb 3rd, decent 2nd","The Rachmaninov Third (and everybody, please stop refering to it as the ""Rach 3"" or, worse yet, the ""Rocky 3""!) on this CD is one of the very best; Janis was Horowitz's student, and this performance has both poetry and virtuoso fireworks. The recording quality itself is astonishing: the piano tone is excellent, and the orchestral sound is glorious. Unfortunately, the 2nd concerto is rather disappointing: it seems a bit too efficient, somewhat distant; the sound also lacks the bloom and richness of the recording of the 3rd. In any case, buy this recording for the Third!"
3,"A good introduction, but little beyond that","This book would serve as a very good introduction to the study of Pidgin and Creole linguistics, but is by no means an exhaustive resource on the subject. Granted, no book could ever hope to contain even half of the theory and ongoing debate on the subject, but this book often fails readers with overly short explanations and ill-backed suppositions. Lastly (and most importantly for any student considering this book as a supplement to their coursework) the reading is pretty dry. I found it hard to continue reading, and often had to force myself sluggishly through each page. Overall a mediocre guide on a fascinating subject in world linguistics/sociology/history/economics/etc. etc.(yes creole and pidgin linguistics cover that much ground LOL)"
3,"Before starting, read beyond the step-by-step instructions","I haven't used my new drill press yet. Why? Because, after following the assembly instructions and setting the machine up, the instructions THEN tell you to bolt a 28 X 21"" plyboard subbase under the machine's steel base to stabilise the machine! It takes two people to assemble the drill press; it will now take three to affix the subbase, something that could easily have been done when the steel base was first unpacked and the remaining 230 lbs. hadn't yet been attached."
5,Sturdy and attractive!,"This shelf took about 5 minutes to assemble - super easy with clear instructions. It is exactly what I wanted, matches the other items in the room and fits perfectly in the spot I had in mind. I don't have a real entry area in my home and backpacks and bags used to end up just in a pile near the door. Now they get stashed on this shelf, which is behind a chair. So now, instead of seeing clutter when you walk in the door, you just see a chair. But the backpacks and bags are still easily accessible. A fantastic solution! I'm delighted!"
2,cracked,"Large crack at bottom, that was actually stained over. I've been really busy, and was late putting this together, now I can't return it without a loss. Also, super short...make sure you measure first!"
3,Good book if you are in the UK,"This book is full of wonderful pictures and a complete history of the standard poodle. However, the author is a former show judge in the UK and spends a considerable amount of the book discussing British standards for show. The recommended diet (raw human food) is contrary to what most American vets prescibe. The information on grooming the standard poodle is quite informative and includes pictures of finished cuts. However, it does not include enough information for a novice like me to attempt the trims."
5,What a beautiful book,LOVE this book. Big hardcover coffee table style. Any standard poodle owner should have a copy! Brilliant!Product came promptly and in wonderful condition..So happy to finally have this ultimate s poodle book.
4,Good information in general,"This is a very interesting book, many good pointers and information. Gives the reader an understanding of the standard poodle. They are truly a wonderful and remarkable dog. Having lost the love of my life, Herschel, I could appreciate many things the author wrote about her loss. I now have a new standard puppy and this book has helped in many ways that one forgets."
2,Wrong size,"The heading says this is 1/4"" wide, but I got shipped 1/2"" and if you look at the enlarged image it shows 1/2"" too. Wish I could find 1/4""."
2,"""Wings"" it isn't!","""Wings of Desire"" is my favorite movie of all time. This sequel is not in the same league; it might be enjoyable entertainment, if you can keep your expectations low. However, I was disappointed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.,"I have purchased ""Event Horizon"" the book. It does not even merit the energy worth opening. It does work very well as a fire starter. I felt cheated out of my money. Trust me, the movie is better. The book was written after the movie just to make extra profits. If you want a good sci-fi book get something from the ""Aliens"" Series or my personnal favorite ""Doom"" (Books based on the game.)."
2,where are Scully and Mulder? ha ha,"Ok,I think I understand this. An astrophsyicist wants to form a new way of time travel(special theory of relativity). On top of it,his wife commits suicide,maybe she was mentally ill(poor thing) I keep expecting to see ""X Files"" meets ""Alien"" or ""virus"" Shame on Paul Anderson!"
3,Quilt book,"If you're looking for simple, country looking, beginner type patterns, then this one is for you. I only gave it three stars because it doesn't contain a lot of patterns, and they are very basic. I love Leisure Arts books for the most part, and adore Fig Tree Quilts a lot. But I'm glad I didn't spend a lot on this purchase because it's just not my style."
3,not quite as advertised,"This is the Revised Brief Thirteenth edition, not the full edition. The paperback version comes with a plastic ring binder that is not suitable for heavy use. In short, this is not the version that a professional editor would want, although it might be fine for students."
5,The Best Slow Cooking Recipes,"This is the BEST slow cooking recipe book out there -- especially if you like your food spicy. The recipes are easy to follow and nearly most of the ingredients are items you usually have on hand. So far, I've tried about six of the recipes, and all have been delicioso! I look forward to trying more. I highly recommend this cookbook."
4,Terrific cookbook.,I made the coconut rice pudding and it is very good. I would never have thought of making rice pudding in a crock pot! The other recipes look interesting and I only wish I had another crock pot! Mine is 3 1/2 qt. and now I want a second bigger crock pot!!!
4,Fantastic,"This series is great, and more thought provoking and interesting than any other fantasy series I have ever read. Although the books are long, I find this good as Kate Elliott is always building up more of her world and making it more believable. This series is not easy to read, but a good challenge. It does appeal to teenagers as both my friend and I have read the whole series and understood it.And changing from different characters is different but I found it to be effective, as some books are ruined by a boring narrator. People should read this book, and don't be deterred by its number of pages!!"
3,There is good potential . . . buried very deeply here.,"By the time G(h)ent is retaken, the reader feels like he/she has been wearing ""Frater"" Agius's hairshirt [for Daisan's sake!] in a sauna. (One also realizes why the real Agius was poisoned by his fellow ""biscop""). In short, unlike the novel, this would be a great yarn if only Eliot realized that excessive theology bypasses versimillitude and produces a laxative effect."
1,"Not a page turner, a page skipper","This is the third in at least a series of four, and proof positive that Ms. Elliott can milk a story as well as Robert Jordan: this series is going on and on and on...ad infinitum and ad nauseum. In order to accomplish this, she has so many storylines and so many characters going in so many different directions, one gets lost (the geneological chart at the front of the book is of absolutely no help at all). As one gets further and further into the book, you'll find yourself flipping over whole chapters and saying, ""end already!""The crime is that she has, in the tale of Bloodheart's successor, a truly fascinating and creative story-line that goes nowhere and has no apparent relationship to the rest of the book.For those of us who loved her JARAN series, this a real disappointment. Let's hope she will mercifully end it all soon and go on to something worthy of her talents"
3,"Not really a novel, just a preamble","In one word, wait. If Elliot keeps up then within the next year or so the fourth and final novel in the series will be published, then you should buy this book and read it. But not now. This novel sets the scene for the action in the next book. Where the first two books told an independent story, (The Kings Dragon -- the story about the fall of Gent; and The Prince of Dogs -- the story of its recapture) This novel tells no individual story. It merely adds to the charectorization and history of Crown of Stars saga. This book should not have been released alone. Better to publish a single twelve hundred page book, then to split this story in such a manner."
3,Altec Lansing XT1 Laptop Speaker System,I bought these speakers for my wifes laptop(dell 9300).First I must say that they are very attractive and very easy to carry.Also the fact that they do not need any additional power source other than the usb port makes them even more portable.However the volume of the sound from these speakers was not any louder and only a little better in quality than what my wife'sDell 9300 was capable of. If you have a laptop that is probably 3 years or more old or a very basic laptop these speakers could be an upgrade for you.Howevr if you own a newer multimedia type laptop these speakers are not worth it.
2,Not potent enough for a classroom,"These are nice little speakers to watch a movie someplace where there are no outlets available. I bought these for use in a classroom setting and they just aren't strong enough. Also, the feature of not needing to be plugged in can be an advantage in some settings but is not an issue for me. I guess I bought the wrong speakers."
5,An excellent buy,"I'll add my five cents to the generally very favourable reviews here. I've had the XT1 speaker system for three months now, and carried it all around the Americas with me. It packs up nicely in the carrying case, plugs in with no fuss, and the sound is amazing for such a small unit -- clean and clear, and easily filling an ordinary-sized room. I also use them as my standard laptop speakers at home -- while they don't rattle the walls like some of Altec Lansing's larger bass-heavy units, they also connect directly to the USB port, so they don't have the terribly annoying static buzz and interference of many cheaper Altec systems that plug into the wall. One of the nicest computer accessories I've ever bought."
4,A good tip for these speakers,"I just bought these speakers, and I was a little disapointed to find that they were only powered by the laptop itself. What, then, is the point of having the auxilary port on the speakers for an Ipod, when Ipods are essentially extensions of the laptop anyway? But I have found that Belkin makes a plug for charging your Ipod which plugs into the wall and includes a USB port on it. Using this works great to power the speakers away from your computer. Now you can play your Ipod on these speakers anywhere there is an outlet. That increases these speakers useability tremendously."
4,last in the series,"You really should read this series in order to fully enjoy the books and understand Brians character. Mr. Paulsen declares in the back of this book that this is the 4th and last in the series that begin with Hatchet, then The River, then Brians Winter, and now Brians Return. The writer also explains how the comparisons in his own life lead him to write this book. The Brian books are very good, and this one is no exeption, except that it is much too short. That is common with this writer though, his books are short but packed with fast paced adventure, the beautiful outdoors, and appealing characters.It seems almost like the writer intended to return to the series for the purpose of finding closure for Brian. Some readers do not feel that closure is achieved though. We do know that Brian does not want to leave the woods ever again."
4,The book Brian's Return on cassette,"I use this with my students who are reading the book as a class novel. Peter Coyote's voice is a little monotone, but the production values include some music and sound effects which help kids get into the story. We read three of Paulsen's books every year in my classes, at the start of the year to get students used to reading a lot and build their fluency. Reading along with the cassette is a great support for my ELL students too. They learn new vocabulary in context and use it in class right away."
2,BRIAN'S RETURN,The book Brian's Winter is the last in the series and in my opinion the dullest one of the series. It is about how Brian returns to the woods after he gets in a fight with some kid. He goes to this councler and decides he has to go back to the woods. The book is not as exciting as the other three and not as fun to read. It could have used a lot more action.
5,Great Book,"Great book, ...Reviewer: A 12-year old reader from Indiana.I thought this was a very good book. I like this book because it's never boring, and it's always interesting. I also think this book is educational about surviving in the wilderness. The only part I disliked about this book was the ending. I thought the ending could have been better. But over all this is a great book."
5,Ancient Airs and Dances,"This is a twentieth centuary interpretation of baroque music. I first heard Dance #2 as the opening round to Morning Pro Musica on NPR years ago and fell in love with it. Whenever I need great uplifting music to listen to, I reach for this CD."
5,"Brilliant, revitalized urbanized sound from the Kaiz...","This is (I believe) one of his better albums. I has a nice blend of contemporary, urban bluesish, with a hint of raw edge contempo!! And lyrically, by far a NO HOLDS BACK! The Kaiz puts the truth of reality into a raw, definitive perspective! By far, the most ""different"" sounding album he has done to date (not blues, not gospel, not REZ influence, not jazz {""Time Will Tell""})...it is different sound delivered in such a way that way that only the Kaiz could do! 2 BIG THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!"
3,This book was great!,Toad heaven was a good book it had a whole lot of comedy and dangers.It is a good book if yoou like animals or you have read one of the other cane toad books.The only bad thing about it is that it dosent have a good ending but of course there is a sequal besides that its a good book.
5,Men's shoe,"This is a very nice shoe. It fit great, looks just like the picture and is comfortable. Would definently buy again."
4,Just about what you'd expect.,"The first and foremost thing I checked was that it only takes a 40 watt bulb. Which puts just enough light to help and not quite enough if you have a bright shop. The other thing I noticed is that I went through my first light bulb very quick when I had it on the bandsaw. I think the vibration killed the bulb (get a light bulb for fans?), but since I moved it over to my drill press, the light bulb has lasted a bit longer. I haven't had any noticable issues with the magnet, it's strong enough to hold the lamp, but nothing else."
2,Over rated Underachiever,"I ordered this magnetic lamp with the intention of using it with a newly purchased Jet Bandsaw. The magnet is strong enough to hold the base to the upper wheel cover, but only with the lamp hanging down. If the flexible arm is angled to the side or up, the base rotates or slips and will not hold its position. This product might work better if the surface to which it is attached is rough rather than the type of smooth painted surface one finds on the Jet saw. Save your money. This one is a dud."
1,"And now, in 2011. . .","I am reading these reviews in 2011, after the worldwide economic implosion, after we've learned just how much the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer in this country. CEO's bonuses have been in the multi-millions while the poor and middle class have seen their wages stagnate for decades. Banks aren't making loans and the rich, after a decade of tax cuts, don't seem to be generating jobs for the 10 percent+ of our country who are unemployed.If God is on any side here, I can't imagine it is on the side of the rich, no matter how much ""delight"" they find in their circumstances."
5,Genio Musical,"Aunque mucho fue el tiempo esperado para esta produccion, Draco Cornelius Rosa, se distingue una vez mas con un exelente producto. El mismo esta cargado de mucho sentimiento y pasion y vemos una vez mas la gran influencia de Jim Morison(The doors) en su estilo. Una vez mas recalco lo exelente de la misma."
1,Epson deserves to go out of business,Epson gave me a good deal (I thought) on a CX7800 to replace a CX5400 because the CX5400 starting giving problems in less than a year. The CX5400 printed fine but used lots of ink until an ink cartridge got badly jammed up. Didn't take long for the CX7800 ink cartridge to jam and Epson replaced the machine because even with tech service help the jam couldn't be cleared. The replacement CX7800 is even worse. It thinks the paper is jammed when there is no paper jam. The small black cartridges quickly run out of ink and they are more costly than the color cartridges! When I try to clear ink jams in the black cartridge it also wastes ink for the three color cartridges! I think I'll put my old Canon BJC-4550 back into service because I never had trouble with it. I tried Epson due to the separate color cartridges and the multi-function capability but the good features are not worth all the trouble.
3,Can't rate yet- need to pick up a USB cable!,"I received this as a gift, and I was all excited and ready to hook it up. I was following the instructions step by step until I got to the part where it says to connect the USB cable. That would be the USB cable that ISN'T included with the printer. No where on the box, on Epson's website, or in the manual does it mention that you need to provide the USB cable yourself. The manual reads like it should be there. I was frantically looking in the box for something I missed, only to realize that I wasn't mising anything. Epson was just too cheap to include a (...)cable that probably wouldn't cost them nearly that much to include. But it looks cool, so I'll be dragging my butt to Radio Shack tomorrow for the cable. (It also doesn't tell you what kind of USB cable you need. You're supposed to be psychic I guess.)"
1,pure frustration,"Epson has designed their printers to malfunction without frequent replacement of their own extremely over-priced ink cartridges. If you try a more affordable after market cartridge you will need to send your printer to Epson repair for servicing. Another of the many examples of the joys of Epson: if the yellow cartridge, for example, begins to get low the unit will stop functioning, even if you only need to print in black. This is a real treat late at night when you're facing a deadline. I will NEVER buy another printer, or any device for that matter, from Epson again. If there was an option for zero stars - this would get it."
2,Not So Funn,Not as fun as some other money mazes I've used. Even with multiple correct attempts it tended to stick. I almost didn't get the money into it before the party because it would not open right.
1,Poor quality,"The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction."
3,Apologetic and Narrow,"The doc was interesting and somewhat informative. I thought the first half of the doc gave fair coverage to both the ELF and the law enforcement sides of the issue. The second half was lame. It focused too much on McGowan's personal story, and did not say much about how the injustices that ELF fought against are still going on."
4,Excited guitar Geek,There were bought for my son who is building a guitar and he is excited about the tuners. Only time will tell how well they hold up.
5,Best buy,Look I read all the reviews about these tuners from when they first came out and let me tell you they don't hold water today. They do everything they say. Honestly I play a lot and change my strings weekly so not having to break out my winder and nipper's was a relief but that's only the half of it. I mostly play a Stratocaster with a floating tremolo so I used to tuning often but with the lock down on these puppies I tune maybe half as much as usual.I never expected to to get twice the product at a significant savings.Planet Waves Rules!I'm gonna order another set for a guitar I'm building next year just to be sure I have them on hand.
4,Review of 35 mm film camera with zoom,This camera seems to be fine but I dont like that it said it came with free film inside the box and it was not in there also there were coupons in the box for film but they expired in 2004
2,Watch the shipping charges!,"The shipping for this unit was $11.27! Pay attention to the pricing, it's pretty outrageous."
2,"Flimsly construction, but it works.","This is bulkier than it should be.The controls are kind of odd, but not really complicated."
3,"decent, but not great","i bought this player a few months ago, and within a couple months of minimum use, it was already broken and unusable. one of the buttons got pushed in and stuck and i was unable to fix it. until then, it was a pretty nifty little thing. however, had i known it ran on batteries, i would've passed on it because i had to change the batteries about twice a week. a pain and expensive. this is good for people who rarely use their player but still want one, or good as a back-up player."
2,OMG ... so bad ...,"sorry to say, i expected my foot to be part of this movie, that's why i ordered it. but it does make brooklyn college look really nice."
3,Ray Barretto's second album with Ray De La Paz on lead vocals.,"While not disastrous enough as to merit a 1-star rating, this 1982 release from Ray Barretto does not live up to the standard set by albums such as ""Together"", ""Barretto Power"", ""The Message"" or ""Rican/Struction"". The New York Salsa scene of the first half of the 1980s was truly in a state of flux thanks to the arrival en masse of Cumbia and Merengue bands which took the city's dance music scene by storm and pushed Salsa to the sidelines and many Salsa musicians (including the genre's living legends) probably saw no other option but to make their music more commercial in order to compete. This album's high points are the hits ""Amor Artificial"", ""Indiferencia"" and ""Manos Duras"" but the other five songs are of average quality at best. If you are a true Ray Barretto fan you'll probably enjoy this CD but know that it's by no means his best work of the 1980s."
5,Misery's dark nightmare!,"You may consider a bit exaggerate this statement but with just only six notable exceptions in all the story's cinema I had not ever seen such portrait which showed with dramatic precision the real essence of the human misery.Thanks to an admirable cast and an overwhelming and realistic, you will feel since the first shots the portentous camera work and the sordidness of this underworld in the same heart of the sacred Rome.This movie is supported by smart Fellinian devices the black humor and the unfinished irony in this unusual family where the fight for surviving will seal its own codes.Nino Manfredi made one of his best performances ever.Watch this powerful movie to realize how far can the reality surpass the fiction.One of the top Italian films ever made!"
3,For doxie aficionados,I'm glad I added this book to my weiner-dog collection. It's not Earth-shattering and one you gotta have though and definitely geared to dachshund lovers/owners. Does have cute pictures of doxies.
2,where's the info,"The rafter jig idea was great, but there just wasn't enough info and detail to actually build it (I thought). I must admit, I'am not a pro as this book ""by pros for pros"" claims, but I guess if I was a pro, then I would probably find the information in this book to be too elementary. This book is ok for learning roof basics, but it's not enough info and detail to fully learn all that's involved with building roofs."
3,"Not bad, but not finish grade","I owned one of the original ""sidekick"", a 6"" sliding saw with almost a 15"" reach. Fantastic for framing (2x stock was a piece of cake) as well as finish carpentry, it was accurate, stayed true and square. Almost never needed to reset it at all. Anyways, after 8 years of use, I almost gave it away to my sis, thinking that I would trade up. After trying the newer ""sidekick"", I was sorely disappointed and have wound up purchasing the Hitachi c10fs. The Hitachi was the only one out there that I believe can handle heavy work as well as cabinetry and still hold true and accurate. The Hitachi is a little bit more than this, but it well worth it.Note- if I was only going to use it for framing and decks, this would be an excellent choice, especially with the stand included. But you would be sad when you saw what it does to oak casing..."

5,"Paul Paray, a French man in America.","Paul Paray (1886~1979), since his chief conductorship of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra from 1952 to 1963, has suffered a degree of neglect. This CD therefore is a splendid reminder of his unsentimental musical interpretations.Paul Paray's recorded accounts with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra of Dvorak's New World Symphony and the Symphony No 2 by Sibelius are invigoratingly athletic ~ typically French one might say. He does not dwell affectionately on moments of tender beauty, but propels the music in a no-nonsense approach which may appeal to many.The performances on this CD have been captured in full-blooded Mercury sound, amazingly belying its 50-year plus vintage.David Lloyd, Bedford, UK."
2,not designed to fit,"I was very disappointed with this product. Amazon shows this as an accesory for the Delta 10"" bandsaw, but it isn't designed to fit. It is definitely not a direct fit, direct bolt on accesory. The table for the 10"" bandsaw does not have mounting points for this fence, and installation is a lot of work. I've resorted to clamps and a wooden fence to make things easy... I would not recommend purchasing this to use with the Delta 10"" bandsaw...."
3,Not too great,"I really enjoyed reading The Millionaire Next Door. The Millionaire Mind, however, seemed to restate many of the things already said. At times this book was outright boring to read, whereas I found the first book fascinating. If you've read neither I'd urge you to spend your money on The Millionaire Next Door instead. For those of you who read Next Door already... honestly, I wouldn't bother with this."
2,Why have to be cheap?,"I've just read this book, and well.... has good ideas, but the bottom line is: become cheap. Why acumulate wealth and live cheap? Not much sense to me. Becoming wealthy for me is becoming wealthy in all aspects of life, not just economically. One of the teachings of this book was that millionaires ride american made cars, and most of them not luxurious ones. For me, that is a clear example of being cheap.There is nothing like a well made european car."
1,Weak and boring.,His first book was pretty good (The Millionaire Next Door). This was quite repititive and boring. Don't bother.
4,Good Continuation of The Millionaire Next Door,Would have given the book 5 star rating but Tom Stanley will never win an award for great writing abilities. The book could have been a lot easier and quicker to read if Stanley did not repeat things as often as he does. Technical content is great with studies explaining why SATs and college grade point averages do not accurately predict your net worth later in life. Over-all a good read.
4,An interesting look at the lifestyle of millionaires!,"A complete study on the lifestyle of millionaires, nothing glamourous as we used to see in movies. By this study you can see the most ""millionaire makers"" entreprises and you have a good idea about the different habits of the millionaire. Which mean, the kind of house their live in, their favorite pastimes, the products their consume, and even the kind of shoe their wear.This book can help you getting richer by emulate the millionaire mind, but it's not really a get-rich-book.It's better than that!"
4,Good Read,"This book had some very interesting information. I expected it to be more of the same info as in The Millionaire Next Door, however, this book covered a different set of millionaires - the decamillionaire! Some very interesting info on education and how we program our children for success or failure. Definitely worth reading."
5,Awesome Book!,"I love that this book teaches you that people who borrow money are basically slaves to lenders - they work for the banks and other financial institutions that loaned them money to buy ""whatever."" And the lending institutions make a fortune off the borrowers. If you can re-train your brain to become someone who accumulates assets, instead of debts, as this book suggests, you too can create a tremendous amount of wealth. Highly recommended!- Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
3,If you only read one of Stanley's books . . .,"Read the Millionaire Next Door. The Millionaire Mind was informative, but it was dull at times and rather repetitive. For example, Stanley spends the first hundred pages demonstrating that good grades in school don't necessarily translate into financial success. Duh! That shouldn't take so long to explain. One point he doesn't make enough, though, is that performing sufficiently well in college WILL open doors and provide opportunities. Doing so gives an indivdual a certain degree (no pun intended) of credibility. From there, it is largely up to the individual to make his or her future. (For a college professor, Stanley seems a bit anti-intellectual at times.) In conclusion, The Millionaire Mind will help us all understand further that there is so much beyond appearances in our hyper-consuming society, but don't expect it to jolt you like the Millionaire Next Door did."
2,Disappointing,"The Millionaire Next Door was well-written and enlightening. This book is a rehash of that book with constant repetitions of the same few conclusions the author has reached. Even at half its length, it would be overlong."
1,Everything you need to know is in the first chapter,"The first chapter contains all the statistical information you need to know, and the rest of the book just rehashes it. This book repeats itself over and over and over, and the examples often contradicted the advice given. For example, the book said that millionaires often rely on themselves for financial advice and don't follow the herd mentality. Then it provided examples of how selecting financial advisers was extremely important. I'll give you some advice: walk into a bookstore, read the first chapter, and then put the book back on the shelf. The rest of the book is BS--an obvious attempt by Dr. Stanley to become a millionaire himself without providing anything substantive. He ragged on economists for not contributing actual work--he should take his own advice."
1,Boring,"The Millionaire Next Door was great. This was a tedious, hashed-over version of it. Should have been titled, ""We Wanted To Make Some More Money Without Actually Having To Write A New Book."""
4,Very thorough,"Quite an impressive collection of reference material in one book. Very well organized. It is basically a whole library in one. The only downside is it's size. The book weighs something like 10 lbs, not something you can take to the coffee shop for a read. I didnt find the checklist section very useful. It contains many scenarios that will not come up in the normal course of business. This book is better suited for libraries and academic institution use. Perhaps if they broke this book down into several volumes it would be more useful. Having said all of this, the book does appear to be very well written and researched. For all of the information that it contains, it is a real bargain."
1,Garmin 2610 training DVD,"For the price I expected more than 30 minutes of instruction. It only touched only the surface of using the Garmin 2610. It is an utter waste of time and money. Thirty minutes with the owner's manual would be more productive. In example, the few seconds devoted to selecting maps to download did not even show how to select multiple segments, it suggested clicking on them one at a time."
1,I came away from this dog with renewed disregard for the fi,"""The Culture of Japan as Seen through its Leisure"" is one of those books that I bought immediately based on the sexy title - and regretted. (I struggled through quite a bit of it, so this review isn't based simply on skimming a few chapters). Reading essays with titles such as ""Golf, Organization, and 'Body Projects' - Japanese Business Executives in Singapore,"" I couldn't help but wonder how these writers manage to acquire so much free time. I came away from this dog with renewed disregard for the field of sociology. Don't buy it, unless you really have trouble getting to sleep at night"

1,Incorrect advertising,Do not order this knife if you are looking for the original superknife with a screw to hold the blade. What you will receive is a knife with push button blade release that releases the blade when you least expect it.
3,It isn't any fun,"I like this album. It is a fine work by a talented poet. Lou Reed explores the demise of a relationship. It procedes from falling in love at a bar, through the excesses of sex and drugs, alienation and finally, suicide. If songs about these subjects is not your cup of tea, this album is not for you. Although the subjects are sad, I enjoy hearing Lou Reed successfully evoke these emotions. The problems with the album appear when he surrounds himself with a cadre of, otherwise, fine musicians. The songs which feature Lou Reed with only a guitar are the ones I feel are strongest. If you are interested in poetry which explores topics of intense emotion or you would like to hear what Lou Reed does when he is not after a hit record, this CD will be interesting to you."
3,Regular Tea drinker,Very good quality product.The only problem I have with this product is that because it is made of metal it becomes very hot if you touch it after the water boiled.Other tea kettles from Krups that are made of plastic do not get hot much.Other than this the quality is excellent.
3,Krups Stainless-Steel Electric Kettle,Pros:It looks good and it works as advertisedCons:It's very loud.It takes a long time to turn off after the water's already boiling.The outside gets scalding hot when the water boils (just like boiling water in a metal pan).The filter in the spout keeps falling out when emptying the kettle for refilling.
2,Not safe!,"I was originally interested in this kettle because my house mate has a similar Krups kettle (the plastic FLF2). I thought this stainless steel kettle would be more attractive, which it is, but it also has the horrible problem that it becomes too hot to touch once the water is hot. The plastic model is safe to touch even when boiling, but the stainless steel model simply heats up too much to be able to use safely.Other problems:- The cord on the base is too short - something like 8"".- Not suitable for the elderly as there is a complex pouring mechanism involving a small trigger underneath the handle that must be pressed in order to allow water to flow.I highly recommend that people interested in this item choose the black plastic version instead."
5,Krups Electric Kettle,This has been a wonderful addition to our kitchen. It is amazing how quickly the water comes to a boil. There are now three of them in our family.
1,Why did Everquest do this?,"Everquest has put out Shadows of Lucin without warning us(the old playerbase) that major system modification would be required.NOTE: this also comes right at christmas when most peoples hard earned cash is being spread thin already.I have heard from some of my fellow players spending up to ($$$)to upgrade things like memory, video cards, and even new p.c.'s just to play at the old level.As far as I am concerned this was uncalled for just to put in 1 minor feature that was not required for play.Thos of us who chhose not to upgrade(or cannot afford to) or locked completely out of the game."
3,massive hardware upgrade necessary for the Luclin expansion,"I have enjoyed playing EQ for quite a while and have a couple of fairly high level characters on it; I looked forward to the Luclin expansion, but the dreary computer hassles (still not resolved) associated with the expansion (and the socalled help line from Verant/Sony is a cruel hoax, their boilerplate automated responses to questions are clear evidence they have not put in the technical resources to help at all) have sorta soured me on the game"
1,Bloviating,"What a piece of badly written bilge. Rohr certainly enjoys pontificating about life and its many mysteries. He is fond of taking familiar quotes completely out of context or misinterpreting them fully in order to support his postulations. I for one put little stock into any proclamations about maleness and relationships, particularly those as they relate to women, when the the author has had no serious physical or emotional relationships with women other than family members. This book is for men who are afraid of what Rohr calls the deeply feminized culture. You know what guys? We are born, we live, we die. Make your piece with it. Enjoy the ride while it lasts. Rohr tries to make these basic truth into something much deeper and profound without offering scholarship and through a very narrow prism of experience."
4,Usually performs well,"I haven't run into many the problems that some of the other reviewers have written about here.However, I almost always use this mouse on a solid single-color surface at work or at my kitchen table. From time-to-time I have found that the mouse laser seems to turn off, and I think this has to do with the batteries getting out of position inside the mouse. When this happens I open the mouse, pull out the batteries and then put them right back. This has always solved the problem of the disappearing laser.The rubber grips are comfortable and four-year-old son is easily able to manage the device due to its practical form. I've never used this at any significant distance from the RF receiver, so I can't comment on the reception from more than 7 or 8 inches."
3,Not the best method to learn Kana,"This workbook is decent for trying to learn kana, but much of it focuses on building vocabulary and starting to learn the Japanese language, which can be done better from textbooks or other sources. I recommend printing off sheets of squares (not sure what they're called, kinda like this [...] and stroke order guides and just using those, it's really just as easy, and I think it works better than this book.Textfugu is a great (online) textbook which I recommend, I got an old Japanese for Everyone book for like $4 but if you really want to learn Japanese get Textfugu rather than taking a class."
4,Great advice,I have given this book out many times as closing presents to first time homeowners and have heard back that it saves money on simple home repairs.
1,not so marvelous things,"i recently went to see the snow patrol and heard that a band called eisely was opening for them. i quickly skimmed amazon to check out reviews and maybe pick up an eisly cd. i now regret buying the cd. eisely is a very very untalented band. their music is uncreative, bland and almost unlistenable. the female singers in this band will make you regret every second that you spend listening to them drone on and on. i swear that they sing each chorus a million times.in the first song the lead singer wails to the point where i've never been able to listen to the entire song. this e.p is so bad that i heard it playing in the dentist office during a root canal and THIS EP was causing me more pain.i've heard that this is a christian band or something and i suppose in the VERY shallow talent pool of christian rock this might pass as something other than pure audio diarrhea but to someone who enjoys talented musicians with female singers i would suggest Bjork or Portishead."
4,A bit disappointing but still a good EP,"The order of the tracks on this EP is really the order of the best songs to the not-so-good songs.""Marvelous things"" is a wonderful, I immediately fell in love when I first heard it. It is definetly the best song on this EP but when I listened to the next track, ""Memories"" it struck me as one of those not-so-good/not-up-to-the-par-of-Eisley songs. I admit it grew on me after a while, the lyrics are great (a little muddled at times though) and the vocals at the ending are superb, a song that really gets stuck in your head. ""Sea King"" is a song that isn't all that distinct and could easily be confused with the tune of ""Memories."" It is a nice dreamy song but not a great song. ""The Winter Song"" has yet to grow on me, it's nice to listen to as background music maybe to study or read but one I rarely hit the repeat button on.It's a good EP to have for all the Eisley die-hard fans but ones that enjoy only their best songs I'd wait until their full CD comes out."
1,Poor Performance,"I saw The Airplane many times at live shows at the Fillmore, winterland and Avalon ballrooms. All shows were exelent. There is something missing on this CD. Very dissapointed. If you like Jefferson Airplane, you will be dissapointed."
2,Unresolved to the max,"Characters unresolved - plot threads hanging and 'talents' who behave like undisciplined children. Sorry to all those rave star reviews, but this book was virtually of no interest. If I wasn't an Anne McCaffrey fan, I would not have finished it, but silly me, I kept expecting something to resolve or evolve or...."
1,this cd is pointless.,"if this cd came out 15 years ago, it might be worth listening to. basically what this band did was put 3 of there favorite records in a blender..."
2,Standard Fare,"Nothing new or exciting, just another wanna-be grunge record. I can't believe people have rated this album as high as they did. I for one am sorry to have wasted money on this very average offering."
5,Buy this CD and you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!,"I really cannot understand why more songs on this CD aren't played on the POP heavy radio stations. For one: Open Road Song - a killer tune to crank up and listen to as you're driving along ANY open road. Just listening to it makes me want to speed. Another excellent song, that WILL be played on the radio eventually, is Leech. It will probably be played a lot when school starts again. Listen, and enjoy. =) I Love S.E.H."
3,I'm going to buy it!,"I haven't even bought or heard this cd, but I have heard Inside Out on the radio and the song sample right here, and I've also heard the other song samples, too. It seems okay, so, far, but I'm going to buy it And when I do, I'll come back and write an, ""After I Bought The CD Review."" Until then, bye-bye!"
5,Amazing!,This is such a great album! The songs are great and the lyrics are amazing! This is well worth your money. I hope Eve 6 is around for a long time.
3,O.K.,"This CD is okay, but it has some songs that are bad like ""Inside Out"" and ""Shower Head"". The truly key to me giving this CD stars at all is ""Leech"" don't buy it."
2,worse than you'd think,"a lot of people are into this type of ""reality"" music. this band is the wannabe Everclear.they have this annoying type of music that's hard to take. it's like eating tastey s***!2 best songs: superhero girl & inside out2 worst songs: small town trap & open road song"
1,Nothing,"This did nothing to bleach, lighten or anything that I was looking for it to do. It was a waste of my money."
1,Dangerous,I haven't tried this product but i did many researches on different bleaching creams and this product can be dangerous. It contains Hydroquinone which can cause skin cancer. It also was banned from other countries.
2,"Good sound, poor durability","I purchased these in August 2007, and was initially pleased with them. Reasonably good sound and comfort. However, one side completely dropped out after a few months. Ultimate Ears replaced the earbuds, and the replacement pair just failed today - they lasted about a year. Bottom line: good sound, good comfort, good customer service, lousy durability. I don't think I'll venture down this road again."
2,Okay headphones,I think these headphones are over-priced. The sound decent but are not very comfortable and the sound quality is not much better than the cheap/generic headphones. I am not an audiophile but enjoy listening to music and appreciate quality music products. I would not purchase or recommend these headphones.
2,There are better earphones out there...,"These don't really fit well in the ears, like others have said. Also, the audio isn't especially clear (especially base and midrange), which for the price they go for is a shame."
3,"Fun short stories, not as good as Sherlock Holmes","I read somewhere that Arthur Conan Doyle wasn't as happy with all of the attention and fame being on his Sherlock Holmes stories, that he wrote other great stuff as well. After reading this, you can see why people felt that way though. These stories are fun, with a few fun plot twists, but they don't nearly rise to the level of Sherlock Holmes. The first three stories are about Capt Sharkey, an old school, classical pirate. They're fun, quick reads with some nice twists. The other stories are all similar: Short stories during the times of pirates and the height of British sea power. They might be a bit too nautical for some readers, as he goes heavily into details about sailing and ship terminology."
3,British Isles Specific!,"I didn't realize, as it wasn't immediately apparent in the book summary that this is quite specific to the UK. I'd assumed that he was going to be covering temperate regions in general. This largely renders the book non-useful for anyone outside of Britain as the species covered appear fairly localized, even if they have close relatives in the US, the varieties are different enough to cause confusion if going upon the info in this book.The biggest bummer is that I've got nobody I could give this book away to since it would cost as much to ship it to the UK as it would cost someone there to just buy it new.No obviously this is partially my fault; I should've known that since it was a UK publisher it wouldn't be useful to me, but it would have been nice for Collins to describe it's region-specificity in the book description submitted to Amazon."
1,Book is great but CD was shipped totally broken! Can I download it as .iso image or .mp3 ??,"Book is for advanced tabla players, Alla Rakha, as always, is great. Many good material. A lot of work for analyzing..."
3,Good movie about a dysfunctional woman,"Movies about dysfunctional women always make me uneasy (OK, they make me downright mad! LOL). I can't help but think ""What are you thinking!?!"" My mom was a bit like this and I refused to be, but then as I got older, I realized I had my OWN set of dysfunctions! hah, joke's on me!The one thing that I genuinely disliked about the movie was the ending (but then I am a bit of a romantic) ... the minute she finally finds a guy who is NOT a dysfunctional mess, THEN she decides that maybe, just maybe, she doesn't NEED a man to have a fulfilling life. gaghhhh Are we against men-women relationships altogether!?!Janet McTeer (who is actually British) did a fabulous job of portraying this Southern babe. Kimberly J. Brown did a great job portraying a normal, average kid ... loved you sweetie!"
1,I should know...,"I'm sorry but I despise this. It's nothing above standard idiocy/chick flick mentality. I was one of the first people to see this too, as I was at a screening at Sundance '99. Let me tell ya, there's something wrong with the intolerant screw-ups who like this."
2,Poor Quality,"(2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for???My husband really loved this bag because it wasn't 'girly or babyish' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle!"
2,not much effect...........,"I followed directions for use in both the clothes washer and in the carpet cleaning machine, but noticed little difference in removal of urine odor.......I'm not impressed with this stuff."
5,Sublime,"Each of these is a lovely work. All range from Romantic to Impressionist. Each is special.Hanson takes works by Eastman students and makes up a restful compendium. Rest assured, these aren't current--the original LP came out in the late 50s, so this is an outstanding document of what was going on in composition at Eastman during that period.Taken either as history, or strictly as music, this Mercury classic is one every serious lover of American music should have. It's pure, sonic balm."
5,Great deal all around!,"This is a great product, for a great price, and I received it in a very timely manner! I highly recommend it!"
2,Ok for one time use,This product was good the first time we used it but it rusted after the first time we used it.
5,"Get the series, they are great, classic children's books","John Dennis Fitzgerald intended to chronicle his youth in Utah for adults, not children. His publisher thought otherwise and the result are these gems. I don't even call them children's lit gems because I find them just as enjoyable as an adult. Before I go on, you should know that Fitzgerald wrote one book about his youth that is for adults, called ""Papa Married a Mormon"". It is one of the most amazing books on the American west that I have ever read. Sadly, it is out of print, and you may, like me, have to pay an exorbitant sum to get a copy. Trust me, save up and do it. Now back to this book. Every single Great Brain book in the series is pure gold, and the entire set can be had cheaply, so I say buy them all at once. I ""put my money where my mouth is"" as Tom the Great Brain would say, and bought the lot."
2,Way bigger than I thought.,"I bought this for a stocking stuffer. Lo and behold, when it arrived it was nearly a foot tall! There are no measurements (except weight) in the products description. Since it was labeled as a toy, I assumed it to be at least as small as the drink it mimics. Now that I bought this for my mom, I'll never hear the end of it!"
2,Gender-biased,"This book is heavily biased toward girls in its use of feminine pronouns. 90% of this book refers to your child as her & she. I would have expected the he's and him's to be evenly split 50/50 with the she's and her's, but they aren't. I flipped through the book looking for male references. When I found them (rarely), they were under negative headings such as ""If your child has a problem"" (p. 150), and ""Signs of low self-esteem"" (p. 137). We have a son and we find this book to be very insulting toward boys the way it is written."
3,This one won't grow on you...,"Seems most everyone else is defending the album, even if they like it. I'm not going to defend it. It's production, as usual, is sharp, but the songs are lacking the feeling and fun of other DMB discs. Reading reviews of the ones who like it, I think they are struggling with it. It's not DMB's best and it's attractiveness will wear off soon and I'll be back to the previous two studio discs."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"Dave Matthews has talent he knows what to do with. I have never been disappointed, and ""Before These Crowded Streets"" is probably his best to date. It's perfect dorm-room makeout music ... but these are songs you can take with you wherever you go and automatically imagine yourself relaxed in a coffeehouse. DMB is fabulous."
5,Just sets the tone,"The very first track on this CD totally explains the way the rest of the songs are. Dave has an incredible way of creating and showing emotion and feeling in his songs, his tones arent always mellow like with some other artists or raging with others. I could listen to this CD over and over and find new sounds and thoughts, it is just like a movie you could watch over and over and pick up new plot developments and such."
3,What the Hell is Dave Thinking?,"Okay, I've bought all the albums, and I admit that I love the DMB sound, but am I hearing things on the fourth track? Who the hell are those ladies singing in the background?"
1,Before these crowded streets i present...,The Vomit machine! This album could make me sick. All the songs are 10-minute long ballads. This is not worth my timw nor yours.
2,He's had better!,"There are a few good songs on this album, such as Crush, Stay, and The Dreaming Tree, but this in no way comes even close to the amazingness of their other albums. While their style and music is different than b/f, the most significant change is his voice.. what happened there? He seriously sounds like Adam Sandler!!!"
1,Not feeling it,I have listened to this CD over and over and I just dont feel it. I would not recommend this album for purchase.
4,"As great as the rest, but something's missing","DMB never lets us down and keeps spitting out tunes that I'll listen to endlessly on my stereo until I wear it out, but this seems to be missing DMB's usual zip in their songs. Other than that it's a total sing-along fun wagon."
1,um.....,this cd is really good.... as a frisbee. nothing more. it does have some great aerodynamics though.
5,STOP LISTENING TO THE RADIO!!!!,"Radio has killed what is truely divine about music...... controlled variety. If the same 20 songs weren't being played in succession those of you who claim to be fans would understand that a fan isn't someone that just knows the words to the songs, but is genuinely moved by the music. DMB is by far the greatest collaboration of talented musicians I've ever heard (considering Tim Reynolds as a member). Dave's songs are more than words set to a funk-driven beat with whispering flutes and amazing strings (inc. guitar) it is a mood, no better displayed than on this album. This album is a must get and when checking it out listen with an open ear, some of the deeper tracks are the best."
2,Too soft for my taste.,"Too many woodwind solos, lyrics in songs are way too political, such as ""Don't Drink the Water"". This album is okay, but it is way too soft, and Dave's voice is getting worse as it sounds. I prefer that you get their older stuff."
3,"Good CD, but far from DMB's best.","This CD contains some maturation of the band, but it lacks the ingenuity of earlier DMB cd's. Songs like ""crush"" and ""Dont drink the water"" have the make the listener want to listen over and over while the others leave us wondering, ""what happened to the band that we all know and love??"".If you are a diehard fan of DMB, i don't recommend this CD for you!!"
4,"I Think, it is a really good set of licks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I think that Daves previous albums were in fact superior to this on. I think that in order it Goes Under the Table, Remember, Crash, and the Streets, but still, it is superior to the average music of everyother band. It is headed up by the great sounds of Stan, and Don't Drink the Water, but Crush, is perhaps the most emotionally and though provoking sound on the Album, resting mainly on the strength of the time between 4:48 and 6:30. Other good songs that don't get quite as much acclaim as this are the spoon, and the remake of Haloween. Overall, Dave made huge strides with this album, and hopefully he comes out with even better ones in the future. (P.S. True fans are willing to critisize, not just stand their and say, ""its the greatest ever man"")"
3,Rock Hall of Famer Allen Toussaint alert!,"Allen Toussaint's Brickyard Blues is a composistion he wrote that was a hit for Frankie Miller and 3 Dog Night in the 1970's, and this version here is great with Allen himself singing. I'd add that some of the tracks are a lil too ""lite"" or ""easy"" jazzy for my goofy gutbucket groove tastes, but overall the spirit of New Orleans is in here."
3,I'd rather pocket the $25 and make my own bank...,"This is a nice and attractive bank, but it's just tin, and in retrospect, since I shopped for this item in an attempt to help my son save and manage his money, a wiser move would have been to save the $25 and create our own bank using empty cans or jars. You could decorate three cans or jars with felt or fabric and they would do the job just as nicely. At 5 my son could care less if the money were kept in a fancy or man-made bank, but he would've had fun creating his own bank and I would've felt a little less guilty not having spent $25 + shipping and handling on this. The plus is that the 3 sections fit together nicely and thus do not take up much space. I'd give this a higher rating (for the value) if it cost $10 less."
5,Excellent,"The book arrived within the stated time frame. It was in excellent condition, brand new. It is the correct book and what I needed for my law school course. I highly recommend purchase of this book and I will purchase from Amazon in the future."
1,"Looks great, works great but only for a short time",I bought my Delta Model 11-990 for occassional project use. While using the handle the cheap brittle metal of the handle disintegrated in my hands. A fine example of taking a well engineered and well designed product but made with cheap materials. I now have to be suspicious of any Delta manufactured product that I would consider purchasing. I still haven't ordered the replacement parts for the drill because I'm so mad....considering putting it on craigslist just to be done with this piece of junk.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I purchased this unit a few months ago, I'm not happy with it. Like so many recent reviews of Delta products, the quality just isn't there any more. My biggest grip is the chuck. I followed the direction to the letter and the first time I use it, the chuck fell off. It destroyed the piece of wood I was working with as well as the bit before I could turn the drill off. I had to replace the chuck because it was bound up after. I spent the $$ (...) to buy a good one from another company. This is my last Delta product!"
3,So So Sequel,"Typical of all series, I hesitate to start one because quite often they fail to deliver the pizaz of the first.This one did not disappoint. The characters that mesmerized us in the first book were overshadowed with new characters leaving unresolved scenarios unresolved.For the life of me I do not understand a female writer continuing to cast a female lead in such a subserviant role. For goodness sakes, everyone in touch with Liath is impressed with her as a stand-up for yourself person, yet whenever she gets near Hugh she becomes a doormat. I know it's all in the hands of the writer but please continue to give Liath the tools she uses in her relationship with the rest of her life and allow her to nueter Hugh with a very dull blade soon. If not, I don,t know if I can wade my way through the remainder of this series.The new characters of Anna and Mathiue are intriguing as long as Ms. Elliot allows Anna to remain and grow from there and not become the milqtoast she allowed Liath to become."
3,prince of dogs,"The book was good, but there are way to many people in this book. Many really interesting story lines. Some very boring story lines. Many story lines that never really turn out to be anything. The book is more enjoyable if you skip the dead end chapters. Good luck this series is all written in this form. Book three was the last for me."
5,"Lovely melodies, complicated harmonies and rhythms","I have 600 folk music CDs and this one is my favorite. River of Love may be the most beautiful love song ever recorded. When Amy soars with the line ""You and I are one, we shine as brilliant as the sun"" you will be moved if your heart is alive and beating. I Am Seen is a terrific song about the ""big questions."" Lovely melodies, complicated harmonies and rhythms. Just flat wonderful from begining to end."
3,Angels Among Us,"I bought this mostly for the Alabama song, did not care much for the rest of the cd."
1,Boring and Terrible D Movie,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am still trying figure out why anyone would use A list actors to appear in such a poorly directed horrible D (not even B) movie. Do not waste your time or money...I wish I could get my $6.99 back from Amazon on the lousy rental!
1,Awful!,"Don't waste your time or your money on this pig. Not good enough to be called an average ""B Movie"". If it's a choice of this or nothing....do nothing!"
4,Delta Delivers,"I was unsure as to which model dust collector to get. They all have the same price in their category, similar specs. Only the paint color and motor seem to be different between models. Ultimately what sold me on this one, was the Delta brand name and the 5 micron bag. Upon delivery (free to my door) setup was a bit involved but nothing a big kid wouldn't enjoy putting together in an evening. Peformance is good, not as powerful as I expected, but I'm using a second stage dust collection separator. I do recommned that as it keeps the main dust collector bag clean of large debris. Also it benefits if you suck up bolts or pieces of wood. There is no protection to the fan blades on the DC. So having a second stage could save you from repairs later."
