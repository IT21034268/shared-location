2,Tough going,"This is not a reference work for beginners. The ""definitions"" are densely written, by scholars too used to reading some dense writing themselves. It's quite possible this is a useful resource for those with at least moderate exposure to the field--as evidenced by the other reader reviews. But I would warn those looking for quick overviews and accessible summaries of difficult concepts to eschew this one. I'm an amateur, and I didn't find this helpful."
5,Very useful reference,"Entries on just about everything, this book has been a very important reference for various philosophy classes."
5,Life Rules is Life Changing,"""I purchased this book for my 13 year old son to read. When it arrived I decided that I should read it first, just because I check everything out that affects his life to make sure it is something he needs to internally process. WOW, am I glad I did! This book is a wonderful, positive, powerful messsage for all the world to read. Since my family has read the book, we have loaned our copy to other family members with hopes of it bringing a change to their life. If you have never read or heard of these two words...Proactive and Reactive then they are something you must know about. They have the power to change your life and to change the lives of those around you!By the way, this is a PROACTIVE statement :) !!!"""
2,Laptop Problems,I bought a Toshiba Satellite A-15 to go to college. I was great for about a year and half. Last spring it overheated so much that it cracked the modem disc in half. Ever since last spring it has overheated at least once a week. I haven't been able to run virus scans because this would cause the computer to shut down. Therefore about 2 weeks ago I had enough viruses and spyware so that I could not use my computer. I took it to the shop and got the viruses and stuff removed. The shop researched the overheating problem and said that their is a class action suit on the model. I called Toshiba the next day and they said that their is no such problem. Does anybody know whether this is true or not? Because I have now taken it to a Toshiba authorized shop to get the overheated fixed.
1,worst laptop ever,"ok, so i bought 5 of these for my business. they all have the same problem. after it works great for a few months, it starts overheating and shutting itself off. not a good laptop to buy...i lost a lot of money. it's a design flaw and there are class action suits against toshiba. the processor fan is underneath the laptop so it can't take in any cool air to cool the processor."
2,toshiba warranty support,"Toshiba's warranty support is awful. My computer has broken down 4 times in its first year, and each time the repair has taken from 2-4 weeks to be completed when they its only suppose to take 3-5 business days. Each time the same problem of the computer shutting down randomly occurs. Thus, be very careful of buying Toshiba products because there warranty support is terrible."
5,Perfect Space-Saving Wine Rack,Just as described. Holds 18 bottles of 750ml wine securly to the wall. You can work in a couple larger sized bottles but they are not as convenient to get in and out. We installed this to store our overflow wine in the cellar and it has been perfect.
5,Nice products,"These are nice, softtouch and sturdy garden tools. I used them all spring and summer and they stood up very well to the tasks at hand and still look brand new."
3,Fiskars?,"I'm sure that these tools will scratch and dig the earth just fine, but I was disappointed that nowhere on any of the three tools was the Fiskars name imprinted, as it is on the handle of the ""Big Grip Trowel,"" and each of the other Fiskars products that I've bought (loppers, axes, log splitter, the big grip shovel/trowel). The only thing imprinted on these tools was ""China."" I thought Fiskars products were made in Finland. Silly me.Oh, well, as I said, these will likely scratch and dig the earth just fine.Still kinda disappointed."
4,Real Artists,"I saw them in a NY concert opening for A Perfect Circle- I will say that being the opening act for a more popular band may make you look less appealing- but their sound is not to be ignored. Being in the mosh pit- people weren't going completely crazy, but there was a general vibe that their stuff is good (heads bobbing, etc). I've also had the chance to listen to their promo CD, and the electronic experimentation is very tasteful. Maybe in a few years, they'll be where A Perfect Circle is- who knows? But regardless, this CD looks promising."
5,It's good!!!,"I really love this CD. It has a great mixture of music, from hard tracks, soft tracks, to tracks that groove along. The CD also has the video for Vulcan on it, a nice little bonus."
3,its generic,the bristles aren't as stiff. The genuine ones clean a lot better in my opinion. Its better than having a brush that wore out though
5,Fantastic replacement for old roller brush,"We have had our Dyson DC14 Animal for 5 years now. The roller stopped working because the clutch died. While I was in there, I notice our brush's bristles were mostly broken off and missing. This would certainly explain why the vacuums rug cleaning performance decreased. Upon reading the reviews for this ""Crucial"" brand brush wasn't an exact replacement, I was skeptical, but went ahead with the purchase. Upon receiving the roller, the plastic construction and quality was equal, but the bristles were thicker and in slightly different locations. Did this affect performance? Absolutely not! The brush works extremely well and brought back life into my Dyson. So, if you are hestitant because it's not an ""Official"" Dyson product, don't be. You can not go wrong with the Crucial Vacuum roller, plus the price is fantastic too!"
4,"Fits DC07, fewer bristles","While this brush bar did fit the DC07, it had far fewer bristles than the original brush. The brush was all black, with the purple bristles that are further apart than the original on my DC07 Animal. It doesn't seem to affect performance, however."
2,letdown,want to hear real techno? try plastikman(richie hawtin) or Adam X. they kicks as*. I have seen Green velvet live a couple times and he rocks but this cd is disappointing.
1,an appointment with disappointment,"I've been collecting house music for over a decade now. I own tracks from Genesis P. to Carl Cox and everything in between. And just as any avid music collector, there are times when you by an album with the hope of finding the next phat groove for your audio enjoyment. I cannot relay my disappointment when I picked up this CD.The tracks never really seem to take hold. It borderlines monotonous at times. I love phat DC, Philly, Chicago house. But this lack of feeling and over all vibe, if you will, was a stark contrast to everything I love about house. I've heard GV's tracks on many other compilations and each sounded promising.Since my initial time of purchase, I've only listened to it 4 or 5 times, just to be sure my tastes haven't changed and my ears haven't deceived me. But alas, it sits among the rest, out of my personal rotation, collecting dust.Perhaps another listen is now in order."
3,Long Awaited Collection,I must have searched for 'Green Velvet' on Amazon about 200 times waiting for a CD release before this appeared. It's a 'must have' for any Green Velvet fan but is largely disappointing as all the tracks are the 'vanilla' versions not the more 'Oh my God my feet will not stop moving' remixes.Good but not as great as his music truly is!
3,Good Energy,"I like this vitamin bc it has good energy and i just looove vitamins anyways. I used to take vitamin C for my energy but i got up to 4000 miligrams a day and started wrecking my stomach since i wasnt eating carbs to soak it up. This vitamin made me instantly feel like ill throw up but i hold it down for exactly 2 mins and it passes. i dont hav any side effects the rest of the day. im only 19 but i would think if it was bad on your stamach it would effect me harder since i now hav a weak stomach. however i think it is the coating around it tht pisses off ur esophogus bc pills/vitamins can NOT effect u instantly like tht. Ill be taking it until i actually vomit then ill probably get turned off on them but for now its better than Acai Berry diet pills, vita C, and laxatives.Ps. if ur stomach is upset take Tagament. its a miracle worker."
1,Terrible,"My daughter tried this vitamin. First day it upset her stomach, and second day she threw up immediately. Not worth getting sick over. Won't be using this vitamin again."
1,makes me sick,"I've only taken this twice (two mornings in a row)and it has made me throw up both times, about 10 minutes after taking it. I eat a decent sized meal before taking it, like the directions tell you too, but I still threw up. Now my mom thinks I'm pregnant because it seems like morning sickness, but I'm 99% sure I am not pregnant. It's good to know that I'm not the only one this vitamin makes throw up or feel sick."
1,One A Day Active Metabolism for Women,I thought I had a stomach virus the last few days and have decided it is this vitamin. I didn't take it for a couple of days and this morning I have nausea again after taking it. There's obviously something in this vitamin that triggers nausea and even after eating oatmeal for breakfast
1,Vomit.,"I have been taking this for 3 days, the third day I haven't gone into class as I'm feeling so ill. Now I know why.After taking them for the first 2 days I felt sick a few mins after and after anything I eat, today it finally caused me to vomit. Not a pleasant experience."
1,Petersen Folding Music Stand Sucks,"We ordered three of them. They were supposed to be Xmas gifts. It took well over two months for delivery. When they arrived, we discovered that something had been ""re-designed"" in the legs, which would suddenly collapse in the middle of your playing, no matter how light the load of music was on the stand. I contacted Petersen, which promised us ""replacement parts,"" which were, of course, on back order. That is some two months ago, and there has been no trace of the ""replacement parts,"" and no reaction from Petersen when I've written to complain. The idea of this stand is good, and I have a couple of friends who have older models that have worked very well, but, as of now, I wouldn't buy anything else designed or sold by Petersen."
2,How to feel what schizophrenia is like,"I wasn't ready for the intensity of the movie. Being protected in an all white bringing up made it difficult to watch the deterioration of what might have been a promising young man. I suppose the author had a rightful message to relay and I felt privileged to be able to sit on my comfortable couch and view the film. I believe there was abit of redemption at the end, but the scars of the mental trauma of childhood remain as reminders. I did like the consistency of Dark ,no wishy-washy stuff."
3,Good light but has a design flaw.,"I used this for a couple of years and it does a good job of illuminating the keyboard, but the bezel ring that protects the LED eventually worked loose and came off, and now the LED wires are exposed. It is just a matter of time before it snaps off..."
1,"So Many Peter Pans, So Little Time!","In 1904 J.M. Barrie wrote & directed his new play ""Peter Pan."" In 1911 he wrote & printed the same story as a novel sometimes known as ""Peter Pan"" sometimes known as ""Peter & Wendy."" Since that time there has been much confusion between the 2 editions of ""Peter Pan."" This product is advertised as a ""Fantasy in Five Acts"" that is, a play. It is an excellent revised/adapted version of the original 1904 play. But if you are a REAL Peter Pan fan, you will also want to purchase the original 1904 version of the play, currently available in the Oxford Drama Series as ""Peter Pan & Other Plays"" by James M. Barrie. May this 100th anniversary of ""The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up"" inspire us all to ""think lovely wonderful thoughts""!"
2,Kaplan CD 2005,The service from the seller was great very quick! But I can not use the disc on my laptop because it is too old:(
5,I think this Lady is a treasure known only to the cognoscenti,"I'm a Christian - but, let's be honest, 99% of ""Contemporary Christian"" music is an oxymoron, not to even mention it being syrup-ridden drek. And suddenly, out of nowhere, here's this Lady. She makes her love and belief for Jesus Christ honestly, very musically, and you don't expect to hear Barry Manilow come halfway whining in as seems to be the case in most other of the genre. Sort of (but not really), ""from the aublime to, etc..."" Ms. Cleveland's rendition of the greatest Rick and Roll song of all eternity, ""Gimme Shelter"" is superior to even (gasp!) the Stones, now that Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, and Ian Stewart are not part of the equation anymore. Fine, FINE music, folks - trust me on this one."
2,Look Elsewhere,"I don't know about you but I have a serious problem trusting the written words of someone who can't even bother taking time to proofread what they write. This book is so filled with grammatical errors, misspellings, and just bad writing that I found it incredibly distracting to read, incredibly disrespectful of the reader, and just plain unprofessional.The content barely scratched the surface on many issues. There are much better books available from Amazon. Try ""21 Things I Wish My Broker Had Told Me"" by Frank Cook or ""Your First Year in Real Estate: Making the Transition from Total Novice to Successful Professional"" by Dirk Zeller."
4,Writer's Digest Review,The sound practical advice this book gives makes it a real must have for salespeople new to the real estate industry. It is easy to follow and lays out the pitfalls and trimphs of the real estate industry.
2,pretty but not too durable,"I bought this dress for my daughter's 4th birthday she adores it however five minutes after she put it on the little rose buds around the waist started falling off, and she was just dancing in it! I was really frustrated with the poor quality of it and how it made my daughter cry minutes after first putting it on."
5,One of the best albums I own,"The Ponzi Scheme by Firewater is a grand work of eclectic sounds and passionate vocal performance. The instrumentals (Ponzi's Theme and El Borracho) pack the same wallop as those with lyrics. The mixing is excellent and the music is very well written and performed (particularly beautiful are Drunkard's Lament and Isle of Dogs). Knock 'Em Down mocks Christian based beliefs while holding the sound of a televangelist gospel song (only a lot better). So Long Superman captures attention from me merely for the campiness of superheros, I Still Love You Judas is very well built. The vocals of Tod A. are full of emotion and anger while still sounding jaded. Though they are rough to the untrained ear, they mix eloquently with the music. The lyrics themselves are some of the best I've ever read or heard and could stand alone on the page were they intended for that."
2,"""Chicago for U.S. newcomers"" would be helpfully descriptive","My rating - take it for what's it's worth - is based on the book's use to me, as a U.S. born Chicago newcomer. There are portions of this book, devoted to entertainment, dining, weather, and neighborhoods, that I found useful. Even the sociological aspects of America, as discussed in this book, were a bit of an eyeopener (seeing ourselves as others see us). Still, this is less of a Chicago guide and more ""Welcome to America"". For those of us who are already familiar with the logistics of opening a checking account, or the difference between a condo and an apartment, the definative published guide to Chicago culture remains to be found."
5,Informative and interesting,"Well done to the author of this book. The book is very hard to put down once you start reading it. The author has a complete understanding of what life is like in Chicago, the book makes enjoyable reading, and the author covers all aspects of working life in Chicago. The book is complemented by including pictures in and around Chicago, and gives helpful advice on working life in the city.Well done for producing such an accurate description of Chicago!"
2,the downward spiral,"This is one of the first Americanized albums after they hit there peak with DISILLUSION. A very pale comparison to Disillusion. Anything you can find by Loudness up to and including Disillusion is some of the finest hard rock of the 80s ever produced. Anything after Disillusion is generally medicore and not worth seeking. Some will disagree, but the truth is what it is."
2,Pure Entertainment,"This book is pure entertainment, not accurate history. It's written in a style that fits the tabloids, not serious works. The author repeats myths that had long been discredited to weave his interesting stories.Overall, it's worth reading in bed late at night."
5,"""If you can't stand the heat, then get out of the kitchen!""","It was about time this album was updated and re-released into CD format. The title track, ""You're In My System"" and ""It's Passion"" were the only singles released from this album and all three were way ahead of its time. I also like ""Stand Up and Cheer!"" This album did'nt do as well on the charts as it should, because the world could'nt stand the heat! Anyone thats a fan of 1980's R&B music and New Wave should get this cd or download it on itunes. Outside of the black communities and New York City, not many people knew about the System when this was released because Sweat was hardly marketed. They were limited to an 1983 appearance on Soul Train and a music video for ""You're In My System"" that was rejected by MTV (meaning lack of exposure), which was the only effective music video vehicle in the U.S. since BET was not a 24 hour channel back then. I guess most of the public could'nt stand the heat of the group, so they left the kitchen (lol)!"
3,basic science of a not well known field,In this book I learned about the pycnocline zoneand the deep zone and that there was a lot less circulation than one might expect in the oceans.Ocean currents and wind currents are very basic in navigation of the world's oceans.The realization sets in that as big as the ocean ishumans can get it dirty with their wastesjust as they have the atmosphere with co2.
1,"All Hype, No Hope","I purchased Avatrol in utter desperation! I saw that the price of the product was decidedly cheaper then Hem-Relief and the ratings seemed to be better. I developed a hemorrhoid in the past week and a half and it was the worst and most painful one I have experienced to date. Unfortunately I ordered on a thursday night and my order didn't get to me until Monday of the following week and I had already endured the worst of pains.When the product arrived I began taking the recommended dosage [one a day for 14 days] and am now just about a week in to my usage without any noticeable change. My hemorrhoid has shrunken, but because of my own application of witch hazel and neosporin and yes, the awful bleeding. This product hasn't really done anything as compared to Hem-Relief which stops hemorrhoids in their tracks.I do not recommend Avatrol, it's all the hype with no hope.J.M. Prater"
4,Take a little 'starch' out of your golf and play better!,"Many of the top tour pros are seeking out Stockton for short game advice. Instead of molding yourself into a posture that would withstand a 100 mph gale and maybe put your brain into the same frame of mind, Stockton will guide you to focusing on your line and the balls ultimate destination. You'll build a stable stance for sure, but you won't be so rigid in mind and body that some of those 'cookie cutter' young guns maintain.He'll provide you with a short routine that you can personalize and build on. I found his instructionals on YouTube to be a good starting point, but you'll need this book for a more detailed account on why he teaches and thinks the way that he does.Dave also has a few personal stories in the book. He grew up with a driver and a putter as his only clubs. I can only imagine having a kids frame of mind and the time and curiosity to practice and become really good at putting......but I'm going to give it a try!"
5,Fun and easy to use,"It took a little work to get it put together, but it was worth it. I have a hard time staying motivated to diet and excercise, but this certainly took away my excuses. It is quiet and the gliding motion is fun. I use some of the techniques from the video and try to lean forward and back and change the pace to get a better work out. The resistance settings are pretty hard, and if I had it to again, I would just buy the one without the resistance that can fold up."
1,Dangerous product,"I had this for a about 5 years, I used it for about 6 months in the beginning, and just last fall I got back on it. Maybe 4 months after I started using it the cable broke. NO, I am not over the wright limit. The cable hit and injured my foot when it snapped with amazing force. A friend had the same thing happen this morning to her. I think there is a design flaw. Unless you like massive bruises on the top of your foot and having X-Rays, I'd pass on this thing. If it had been continuously used I could see how it just wore out, but less than a year of use? My friend has had hers for about 19 months she says but didn't use it the whole time. We tried to contact the company but the website doesn't work, 800 disconected. Anyone have better contact info??"
4,"Tony, Me, and a Great Gazelle","When I first purchased the Gazelle, my partner Jim was very skeptical. But once I showed off my new nice tight buns courtesy of Tony Little, he became an instant Tony fan. Now, we both have our very own Gazelle and we are having a blast! yeee haaaaa!!!I recommend this to all people; little, small, fat or big, Tony will get you pumped up! So buy this thing, and rock out LITTLE style! oh yeah.Thanks Tony!-Bill & Jim in PA"
5,Ratt,good albem must have. Every one should have one in there home to lisen to. Go buy and others now.
4,Swing like it does,"The fourth album from INXS was, along with ""Shabooh Shoobah,"" where they really began to explore their voice as a band. Nowhere is that more telling then in the lead song on the disc, the bittersweet tale of interracial romance ""Original Sin."" Causing more than a little controversy at the time of its 1984 release, it both celebrates love and shatters idealism, all in the context of Nile Rodgers' ""Let's Dance"" styled production. It was a bold move and was worthy of the attention it attracted.But then, the band further experimented. In addition to the funky ""Original Sin,"" there was the spacey ""Johnson's Aeroplane"" (which I thought, for years, was called ""Japanese Garden""), the quirky ""I Send A Message"" and the soulful ""Burn For You."" It was still a mild mannered affair if you compare it to the harder rocking (and more popular) ""Kick,"" but next to that breakthrough album, this is probably my favorite INXS album."
5,Missed Treasure,"Had this on Vinyl years ago and simply loved the Music. The album Never caught on in America but was Huge In Australia. America missed the boat on this one. Simply some of the best dance rock ever layed down. Maybe a little too Funky for some folks but check out Dancing on the Jetty, Melting In the Sun, Original Sin and just about any other Track on the Album. Bought the CD from the BMG Music club In the 90's but Bought the Target Version of this Disc from the Seller. Cool Looking Disc. CD was delivered on time and in very good shape. I'm Happy with the sale. Do Yourself a Favor and check out this album in any form you can get."
5,"Great, yet also fun","A collection of some of the ""must-have"" recordings in the world of jazz. Superb playing from everyone, with jaw-dropping work from the two leaders, guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist Stephane Grapelli/Grappelly (it is spelled both ways on the packaging). As far as GREAT recordings are concerned, these are among the most fun. The interplay and invention are exciting and the effect on listeners is palpable, producing joy and probably even some dancing. Highly recommended."
2,Too much sameness,"This CD was a big letdown for me because the reviews I read led me to believe this was something extremely special. While Kate Wolf has an incredibly rich, full, and beautiful voice, the material on these CD's seem to have a monotonous sameness -- once you've heard one you've heard them all. Very little change in tone, tempo. mood from song to song, and not much expression or creativity in interpretation or arrangment of the pieces. Her voice is awesome but I was disappointed and bored with this CD."
5,movie,i am trying to replace all of my tapes with dvds and this was a greate movie.i liked it when it came out and i still like it
4,Wonderful acting by Sigourney Weaver,"Sometimes you see a movie with such great acting in it, you can never forget it. I can't imagine anyone playing Dian Fossey other than Sigourney; throughout the whole movie, you can feel her rage, her loneliness, her determination. I also think this movie did a good job in not making Dian look like an angel, because as devoted as she was, she had her flaws. Years of isolation in the remote mountains of Africa hardened her. Sometimes I think it would have been better if instead of endlessly fighting with the hunters, she had changed her approach and helped give them job oppurtunities so they had other ways to make money besides hunting. However, despite her flaws, Dian Fossey still deserves to be recognized and remembered for her selfless efforts to protect gorillas. This movie does just that."
3,I was surprised,"I am a fan of The Wilkinson's and absolutely loved every song (except the last one) on their first CD. I bought this CD and was kind of dissapointed because there is only one fast song (#1: Jimmy's Got a Girlfriend) and every other song on there is slow, pretty decent, but slow. There tends to be a single theme throughout the whole CD also about love and breaking up.. Kind of a negative vibe. BUT....I do think it is OK and worth a purchase, If only for the first song."
5,The Wilkinsons is what we all need Here and Now!,"The Wilkinsons have done it again and even better. Their first single from the album, Here and Now is 'Jimmy's Got a Girlfriend'. This teen oriented song is so taking and gets you singing along before you know it. 1999, is my personal favorite song and it is very nice. It is about a girl who is with this guy who isn't over his old fling. She tells him to get over it or she's is not in the picture. The whole album is very creative and challenges everyone of their voices. Steve co-wrote almost all the songs and Tyler and Amanda wrote one together called 'It was Only a Kiss'. Tyler has become a heart throb to teen girls all over and takes more of the leads on this new album. It is really worth the money and just great!"
4,"A fresh ""Clinish"" sound that envelops your music senses",I was listening to Public radio on AM on a trip across Texas. They played samples from Mandy's new album. I was definitely moved by the very smooth quality and sound of Mandy's voice. Mandy is most impressive on the slow songs that have lots of feeling. Patsy Cline may be standard for this type of music. Mandy will make her mark on Country. It is just a matter of time.
4,Not a Country Music Fan,"I don't really listen to much country music, but I have to admit that this disk caught my ear. It was a gift from some Tennesseans who had seen the Pasty Cline act starring Mandy. The production quality is near perfect, with mixes that allow the character of each instrument to be heard AND allow Mandy's wonderful voice to stand out. I like to listen to it in the car, especially at night or when it is raining. I'd give it 5 stars but I'm not a huge country music fan."
4,If you love Patsy....,"A friend of mine recommended Mandy Barnett to me. When I listened, I was blown away...and I thought Patsy was dead! But heres the thing....Mandy has a great vocal range and ability, but because she sounds so so SO much like Patsy Cline, it will be very difficult to musically produce any of her vocals away from a classic Patsy arrangement, to make way for Mandy so she will not always be defined as a Patsy clone. I look forward to hearing her new album, and wonder how the song production is going to work out this time. I dont mind the song arrangements, I rather prefer the older sound of country, but something can be added to the mix to spice things up."
5,"A MUST READ - wonderful, historic, and important story","I wish to thank Sharon for writing her story. It is a great example of the forced cultural assimilation for many Native Americans around the 1950's. It also brings along many light-hearted, funny, passionate, solemn, difficult, and challenging stories and tests of the soul. I highly recommend this touching and quick read."
5,this is a great album,"this album is great it has heart and it's strong. darryl worley very tallented singer and songwriter he has a nack for picking songs everybody will love like Awful Beautiful Life, if something should happen and wakeup america. you'll love it!!!"
4,Purchase was awesome - Movie was good too!,"Purchase was hassle free, product arrived on time and as indicated. The movie itself definitely tells one side of the story - but it's the side less heard, so it was interesting to get another perspective on history!"
1,out of date,"This book is really out of date. Norbeck, an anthropologist who did research in Japanese fishing villages in the late 1940s, did additional research in Osaka in the 1960s. This book is the product of that research. Possibly some antiquarian interest, but even that is stretching it."
2,Horrible shipping,"The shipping box came to me broken.The order was supposed to be a set of 3 books. The books came from a broken set, two had a plastic protective wrapper and were in good shape. The third book did not have the protective wrapper and it had a big gash on the front cover. I am not happy with it, but I couldn't return it because I needed the textbook."
2,"Pretty,but not that great","This doesn't hold a lot of hair and my hair gets caught in the scroll design and pokes out. I don't like this Barrett very much. It is beautiful and looks fine if you are using it more in a decorative manner, Like to adorn a chignon."
3,It is What it is,"It is what it is and that is listings of various ""strange"" ways people have died. Some of these are really far out and at times I found myself laughing out loud while reading this. If you have a morbid sense of humor you might get a kick out of this."
2,It is of poor quality,"I would not buy it again,It leaves horrible results.I would not recomend it but you canbe the judge for your self."
3,"Good mystery, skip the romance","The romance angle of the book left a bad taste in my mouth. Thankfully it only gets a few pages toward the end of the book. You will find out the reason why very quickly. Rather awkward. I could have put up with the fairies, but not this.The mystery plot was a heck of lot better. So read it with a tolerant eye."
2,"Promising, but weak","An older work republished, The Love Talker is a weak romance/mystery that has touches of the wit and humor that mark her better works. I found the plot to be simplistic and predictable, which isn't always a problem if the ride is still fun. However, I couldn't get behind the romance in this, and it seems the author couldn't either, as she only puts it in play in the last 2 pages. So, no real suspense... no real romance... no real read.Peters best work is in her Vicki Bliss and Amelia Peabody mysteries, which I have read and re-read over and over and are worth the price."
4,Short and satisfying,"I really like this book and have been waiting (im)patiently for the next one. Although it is very short, and doesn't have a lot of literary ""filler"", I never got lost. Adrien and I must just think alike.This book had just the right amount of hurt/comfort, tough guy with a heart, not-so-tough guy with a brave streak.Now, if they'd only ship me the next one!"
5,Robert Plant Transcends Zepplin,"Despite what many fans out there believe, Robert Plant, like a fine wine, has improved with age. This album is probably one of my favorites in that it shows Plant's versatility as a serious artist. This in and of itself is a challenge to anyone playing in what is so commonly referred to as ""heavy metal"". The track ""Sixes and Sevens"" is absolutely haunting, and ""Trouble your Money"" demonstrates just how much Robert Plant can sing even what I would term a more ""jazz"" tune and put forth a fantastic delivery. This is a must own for anyone who is a fan of Robert Plant."
3,MC 900 Ft Jesus meets Poe,"Laika is what it would sound like if Poe performed vocals for MC 900 Ft Jesus: half-hushed, half-sung lyrics floating over electronic beats, fluttering bass clarinets, muted trumpets, and the ever-present tremolo of the the Rhodes piano. ""Black Cat Bone"" is ""Falling Elevators"" with a voodoo vibe, ""Widow's Dream"" has the same somnolescent vamp as ""Bill's Dream"", and the beat poetry of ""Badtimes"" is a Facebook-era update of ""The Perfect Gun"". Whether you interpret this high degree of derivativeness as homage or something less flattering depends upon your point of view. Personally, I like this album. ""Good Looking Blues"" is a pleasant spin, but I believe this group of excellent musicians is capable of more originality. I hope they prove me right."
2,Disappointing!! dont waste money on this....,"the only ""eh well"" song is the one everyone knows..""uneasy"" the others are really bad!! i tried hard to love the whole albume but useless..as they claim, the laika gang is not producing the space sounds even though their Russian dog was sent to space...they could have learned more from Alpha that used dog barkings in their ""come from heaven""..it is so experimental and scary..i dont even know how this albume was in everbody's favorite list?!...anyway it will just stay in my cd collection and one day in 40 years maybe i will feel listening it again;...(..."
1,Don't support this release,"What fans need to know about this unauthorized release is that this is a bootleg, pirated version and the poor quality of the colorization and 3D conversion results in a terrible presentation. Worse, the talent who made the film will not receive a penny from this release. If you want to spend $12 and support the original film you can do so by going here [...] and donate where your money will go for a good cause and be appreciated!!PS. it forced me to rate this!"
4,Promise Wasted?,"On occasion, God will grace an individual with gifts almost beyond measure and although things start off well enough, at some point, the wheels come off. We are currently seeing the wheels wobble and the cart heading for the ditch with Amy Winehouse. She has a voice I haven't been able to capture in words, and a personal life that is so rife with self-destruction and psychological co-dependency that disaster can't possibly be far off. Her boyfriend (Blake Fielder-Civil) is akin to kerosene near the flame and reading of her cutting herself with the words ""I love Blake"" while being interviewed for SPIN magazine made me want to call Bellview and initiate an intervention.Very sad. I hope she gets some help, pulls herself together, gets rid of additions in her life, realizes that using the word 'f**k' every 10 seconds doesn't make you bad, it justs makes you sound low-class and I hope she hangs around long enough to sing the title song for the next ""James Bond"" film as planned in 2008."
2,Absolutely unoriginal,"Unless you are Rip van Winkel who went to sleep in 1959, or under 13, just race through the book and see whether you notice anything you haven't seen at least 10 times before. Occasional insights, churned out by a competent hack."
5,"Excellent quality, comfort, and style.","This bed looks as good as the manufacturer's picture. It's all made of 100% polyester, but looks just like suede.It's fully machine washable - both the inner removable pillow, and outer bed. My cat jumped right in and was sleeping in it within an hour.This is a great value and an excellent bed that should outlast more expensive beds I've bought before."
3,Not all are the same,"I have purchased 3 of these laser pointers, the first 2 where ok, but the third one even though it was supposed to be stronger than the other 2 came with a defect and is far less powerful, the dot allso has a halo around it where i think the power is going, i dont know why these is but was a little dissapointed with these third laser."
2,Poor performing pointer pen <|;-(,"This pointer was purchased for guest speakers to use with their presentations to a Community College service organization.It performed OK when tested fresh out of the box when it arrived from Amazon. However, when put to use in the lecture hall, the beam comes on bright, and quickly fades to barely visible.Since I was satisfied with the initial performance, the box was trashed and I fee I am unable to return the unit. If Amazon could grant permission for me to return this for exchange, I would be delighted; PLEASE RESPONDGreen Laser Pointer II (Purchased on 06/11/2011)by Mpo"
3,NOT in a metal case,"I bought this laser pointer as a gift because the picture shows it in a neat, sturdy metal case (which my pointer came in and it passed the practice test). I'm not happy that it came in a flimsy cardboard case instead and the lid is held down by a weak magnet, not sure how this will hold up for traveling. I could have gotten a pointer with the flimsy case for way less $$$. The pointer itself is bright though and seems to function as expected, as far as one can judge from briefly trying it out."
1,I'm Sad It's So Bad.,"What happens when you trade in geek ethic for euro-rave/britpop chic. Ever wonder if those annoying ex-patriates you see on vacations have a band? The first rentals album had true artistic statement ... the second is nothing but mimicry. Strained-faux vocals, delusions of european romanticism, self-induced exile. say it ain't so."
3,"Getting Better, Getting By","I bought this album simply because Weezer has not released anything in so long. It's no ""Pinkerton"", but it is a drastic improvement over ""Return of the Rentals"". If you like European bands such as Ash and Blur, you will probably love the Rentals improved sound. The moogs are still there to keep their electric sound, but the overall sound just rocks a little bit more than before. If the Rentals continue to improve I may start buying their albums for reasons other than Weezer withdrawl."
4,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","This book was a truly wonderful read! I found myself drawn into Judith's world and kept forgetting that this was not actually her long-lost journal but rather a tale written by a modern-day author. Amazing! Ms. Tiffany's choice of language was very authentic and the story was most compelling. There were enough plot twists to keep the story intriguing and keep me turning the pages late at night. I was rooting for Judith during her many escapades, and while everything did not turn out as I thought it might, I found the ending to be thoroughly satisfying. This book has renewed my interest in Shakespeare's work and I look forward to reading Ms. Tiffany's future work as well. I definitely will be recommending this book to friends and family!"
5,"Different, but worth it","I've been a huge fan of Billy's since the old ""Stroke Me"" days, so I was very excited to see he had a new cd. When I first listened to this disk, my first response was ""what the hell is this?"" I put it away and didn't pick it up again for weeks. When I finally gave it another chance, I totally fell in love with it. It's not the Billy Squier you know and love, but in some ways it's better. A few months later, I still listen to it constantly. This is great acoustic music and Billy has shown us all exactly how talented he is! Try it, you won't regret it."
3,Sigh... time has not been kind,"Vastly different from his other CD's - solo acoustic guitar - but I expected that from reading other reviewers. What I did not expect was his voice. The songs themselves weren't bad, but they were totally ruined for me by his screechy, off-key singing. Fingernails on a chalkboard is not too unkind of a description. It's a shame, b/c some of the tunes were quite nice, and the guitar playing was good."
2,BILLY SHOULD STAY TO HARD ROCK,BILLY IS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED GUIRARIST OF HIS GENERATION. BUT AN ENTIRE NON ELECTRIC ALBUM IS A LITTLE MUCH. I WOULD LOVE TO HERE MORE OF HIS MUSIC. ESPECIALLY IF HE RETURNS TO HIS ELECTRIC GUITAR.
2,2nd Worst Beck Album,"No way! couldn't take this same way with ""Stereopathetic Soulmanure"" it just plain sucks!"
5,assassin review,"Lo-fi,dirty genius....No need for a long winded review here.Why? Because i could write all day about how good this album is.I have a deep love of music eg:Radiohead,Portishead,The Doors,The Beatles etc, and this album (for me)ranks well up there with some of the best efforts from the afore mentioned.Beutiful chord's and lyric's,simple arrangement,and an overall sound that give's the impression that it was recorded in his garage(it probably was).A must buy for anybody that consider's themselve's a true music lover."
4,beck gets acoustic. a good album for the walkman.,"in 1994 beck dropped 3 albums. his classic major label debut mellow gold (you know the one with loser on it). and 2 others on indie labels (one foot & stereo). stereo was the weird odd and ends of early beck stuff nicely put together on one disc. and one foot was the low key acoustic one. this is a really great laid back album (except for Burnt Orange Peel of course which is about as punk as beck gets. lol. how weird he would throw that on here, eh). anywho this is a great album to put in the walkman and go for a walk around the block to on a sunny day. it's great for doing that in fact :) i've done it many times."
3,She'll do anything,"This is a low-fi recording by Beck. It's mostly acoustic, with a few electric performances. It has a feel like ""Beck got together with some of his non-professional friends and played some songs"". This album could actually be mistaken for a collection of demos. It features Beck's usual kind of oddball songwriting. People that are already Beck fans should enjoy it, but other people might not find it too interesting."
4,Beck is a low-budget Genius,"This album sounds like Beck dug a guitar out of the trash and recorded this album one afternoon. The brilliance of Beck is that he can make the trashiest songs very sincere and passively genius. At first listen, ""One Foot in the Grave"" sounds junky and contrived. However, upon closer inspection, each song has a personality of its own and undeniable sincerety. If you like Beck, you must have this album. It transcends its outer surface of being low-budget, and Beck has some interesting background vocals from random friends of his on various songs. This album is simple,funny, and sincere."
2,"Very Superficial, Dated and Basically worthless","Did you really think Allen Dulles would give us the beef ? This book is akin to a joke as far as content goes and I really think it is meant to hold coffee tables down rather than be read. Revelations such as ""Most countries have 2 intelligence services rather than 1"" and foreign hotel rooms reserved for dignitaries are usually bugged in the Soviet Union are shocking deep revelations typical of this poor excuse of a book. Buy it used if you must or better yet, peruse it at a library first and you will see it is worthless."
1,If you want to see how stupid Allen Dulles really was,"read ""Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA"" by Tim Weiner. He uses declassified documents to write his book. It's quite unflattering to Mr. Dulles and the CIA as a whole."
4,Russian time.,"Most negative reviewers of this book do not understand the time it was written in. This was a time whenthe USSR was on par with the USA in terms of political influence and military might. If you read this bookthrough this paradigm, you will see why the USSR absorbed DCI Dulles' attention so much."
2,Disappointed,I have bought this sneaker before and thought it was a good running shoe. It was the black/smoke/gray one but i recently bought these white/blue ones and the quality of the shoe has really gone down. I still have the black ones which feel alot better than these brand new ones.
5,Excellent mix,"Paul Oakenfold's CD alone deserves 10 stars. If you liked Tranceport 1, you might like this one even more. I am not kidding; it is that good. Very melodic, accessible stuff. Techno purists might argue that it is too mainstream (whatever that means). Who cares? It is awesome. Track 7 is one of the many highlights; it is based on the ""Adagio for Strings"" which also happens to be one of my favorite classical pieces. The Fatboy Slim CD is good but it does not even come close. The best way, in my view, to think of FAtboy's music and his mixes is to think of it as experiments in sound. Essentially, that is what they are. Fatboy takes literally every conceivable style of music and puts it all together. The result is not that great but, once you are used to it, fun. great deal."
4,"Good, get Essential Millennium instead","If you're buying this just for Fatboy Slim, go get Essential Millennium. It has the exact same FBS songs, 15 Paul Oakenfold, and 17 Pete Tong songs. I suggest Essential Millennium, although more expensive, it is a better package. Have Fun!"
4,"Come for the Oakenfold, Stay for the Slim (or vice versa)","What marketing genius thought up this two disc set. Anyone who knows anything about electronica knows that the two featured DJs don't exactly have the same following. It's almost like having a two disc set of Korn and Backstreet boys (ok so that's an exageration.) But for some sick, twisted reason it works. If you like trance listen to oakenfold, then for kicks see if you like FBS. Or vice versa. Both are strong mixes and have some great beats. Oakenfold has some strong buildups and lots of swirling mixes. FBS has a very odd but compatable series of booty-shaking funk and big beat. Of course Oakenfold is the better mixer, but FBS holds your interest by putting songs together that should never be put together (like Born Slippy and At the River) Either CD is probably work the whole price. If you don't like the other use it as a coaster or give it to a friend."
5,Excellent product,I can't testify to service or warranty from Swann but the product is great. I have installed five about six months ago and have had no issues. I am now helping a friend install four at his house. I tried the Swann Max Day/Night camera because it had 66ft for IR but it was no better than the Bulldog 33ft of IR. I would highly recommend the Bulldog.
5,Esca-fan!,"The first espisodes are slow and it takes time to build up to the plot. But once it picks up, I could not turn it off. It is beauiful and romantic. It is by far the best anime out there. I enjoyed and watch it many times. I am an Esca-fan for life."
5,Best Overall movie,"Saw this in the movies and who knew that HD-DVD culd look so amazing even compard to the theaters and thats also counting the amazing sound quality. The movie itself is a great ending to the Bourne Trilogy and if you liked he last ones even a little bit then this movie will be sure to amaze you. Action and unbelievable chase scenes makes other movies just plain boring. Great if you got an HD Player but considering the format might not last its not the greatest investment. My only problem with this is the soundtarck, which is has great quality, but the songs do not live up to the movie. Being OK to a great movie. RECOMMENDED IN ANY MOVIE COLLECTION"
4,a heart rending sequel packed with action,"Action, Action, Love and loss, more action, aliberal dose of suspense and more action. Boredom, not going to find it here. A great follow-up to the original."
1,the bourne ultimatum,"Having so much enjoyed the first two ourne flicks I pre-ordered bourne ultimatum as soon as you made it available.. Oh my! What a non story! The chase scenes, fight scenes were taken right out of the first two films.. I suggest you do not waste your money on this production."
2,Bourne Again,"Just like the others in this series, this is totally not like the book. In and of itself it is sort of ok, but still the book series is still better. I would have preferred that the movies stuck to the stories in the books."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the first two Bourne films. A violent, intelligent, multi-talented character who doesn't remember his past or who he is, Bourne provided irresistable, intriguing escapism. I found it easy to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. This third effort, however, insults the viewer's intelligence on too many levels. The plot is nonsensical and full of holes and the camera work is irritating. Unlike the first two films I didn't engage with this at all. At the end my reaction was an underwhelming - so what? The makers have gone for an easy option, formulaic hotch potch - a ""this will do, it's only an action movie"" product lacking in character, motivation or even thought. This could have been a great series. A series it will still probably be, but any pretence at quality has gone with this poor effort."
3,Series,This series keeps getting more exciting. the transition to the legacy was different but good. I forgot how this movie ended so not show how the hollywood style of the book set will play out. Also never compared the two either..
5,Best one . . . yet,"This is the best of all the Bourne movies. Non-stop action, for one. HD quality is great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies but remember this is the third in a series. (Note: you need an HD-DVD Player to view movie)"
5,"Get some sleep, Pam. You look tired","Matt Damon is superb in the third Bourne film and I hope there's a fourth. Some of the best stunt and fight work I've seen in years. The intrigue keeps you on the edge of your seat (okay, my couch...) and is worth the nail chewing. Buy it!"
1,Bad F/X,"The director, camera man and editor should be fired. They took a ready-made blockbuster and had to play cute. The jiggly camera was totally unneeded. The MTV cutting made the picture a mere blur. The director OKed the whole thing. Very bad choices."
5,AWESOME,"I do not discuss plots with movies. Better to not ruin things and let people watch without knowing what is going to happen.Absolutely awesome. The best Bourne yet and maybe the best action flick of the year. If it isnt number 1, it is very close!!"
5,Worthy Sequel,This is a worthy sequel to the previous two films in this series. Well done and well acted and the stunt scenes are fast moving and action packed. They also even left open the possiblitie of a fourth film.
5,3 for 3,"Usually when you see a hyped up movie, you walk in with high expectation and a film very rarely rises to the challenge. But Bourne Ultimatum exceeded my expectation and left me wanting more. Damon is so good as Jason Bourne, that one would argue that he was born to play this character. Sure this man flies around the world at the speed of light, but the action scenes are so intense and feels so real. I especially love how they tied the ending to two into the third act of three. Just excellent writting. Overall: Highly, highly recommended."
4,Fantastic Action,"Jason Bourne is THE new action hero.From beginning to end this movie kept me engaged and interested. I watched this on a long, crowded train trip and it kept me fully engrossed and perfectly distracted. I found myself wishing it would go on longer, and hoping for a couple more films in the series if they have this same pace and action.I enjoyed it completely."
1,DVD Nightmare!!!!!!!,"I think that the story follows the first two, and it has some good action. My problem is with the DVD itself, it would freeze every two minutes and at some point it just froze so badly that i couldnt even get the DVD out of the DVD player, extremely bad quality DVD, very frustrating."
1,How is this related to the Bourn Ultimatum again?,Follow the link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_Ultimatum. Read it. That way you fully understand that the movie you are thinking of watching is not the book adaptation. It is poorly thought up cliches that were vomitted from the bowels of someones cobwebbed imagination.This is the third installation of a horribly adapted movie. The entire Bourne Franchise should be given the Worst Adaptation to a book ever. I will say this - for the first time I really appreciated the Bourne Character played by Matt Damon. He has always played Bourne really well. However - who are the rest of these characters? What is BlackBrair? Who is Nicky Page? Who is?.... the list goes on. What happened to Carlos the Jackal? What happened to Moe Panov? What happened to Alexander Conklin? Who in the world are all these characters? The series sucks because the deviated so far from the book that the beloved character no longer exists.Truly. Truly. Truly dissapointing.
3,The Bourne Ulti-nauseum,"Intense action - checkBombastic score - checkNauseating, jerky camerawork - checkNeverending cat & mouse chases - checkThis time around the Bourne franchise is a bit big for it's britches. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is near indestructible and although the agency trying to catch him gets incredibly lucky tracking him, time after time, they're always a couple steps behind. Don't get me wrong, still an interesting thriller, but I really hope if there is a fourth they try to come back down to Earth.And one last thing: Why must they save the dope theme music to the very end just before the closing credits?"
2,Too much camera movement,"It took me almost the entire movie to try to ignore the style of camera shots on this movie, and not even then I got accustomed to the filming style.It remind me of typical first-time amateur home video movies where the camera never stays still.I understand that sometimes the camera needs to move fast to follow the action, but even then it should be done following a movement path with a panning that is not shaky and well calculated to stop accurately when it finds the target sitting still, without continuing the camera movement and then returning.Almost all the camera takes of still people and objects, were done with the camera moving up/down and left right in a constant motion, which was distracting and unnecessary because there is no need to fake action on a scene that is suppossed to be still. Any action movie needs those kind of pause breaks, this was a non-stop style of camera work.I liked the movie, I feel sorry for the poor camera choice by the director."
4,"Good movie, Great series!!","...everyone has already touched on the good points, however, I do want to know what the director was thinking with the use of the camera during fight scenes as well as some rather dark scenes. Kind of lost me there... but other then that. A good flick and overall GREAT series."
5,Love it.,"5 stars because mint condition, arrived quicker than expected and an ultimate all-time favorite movie for all guys and gals. It has suspense, romance, and travels around the world. My teenage boys love the unique hand to hand fighting techniques. Borne doesn't tell you why he's going to do things this way, just does it and is amazed how he knew it would work! After the escape or conspiracy or scene, you go ""now it all pieces together""."
5,Great Book,Thoroughly enjoyable and informative. I would recommend it to any lover of thoroughbred race horses and anyone who likes a good read.
1,Microtek is Mediocre,"My Microtek i900 arrived on Feb 1. Six WEEKS later is was completely broken and I had to send it in to be replaced. Along the way, Microtek customer ""service"" was anything but helpful. In fact, they have ONE technical support person on staff--I know because I spoke to him several times.The scanner itself produced fine results. Even if it produced the best scans ever seen, I would avoid Microtek at all costs due to their awful product support and performance."
3,"scanner good, but.......","When I first got this scanner, it took me about ten tries to install the software so that it worked. This is a known problem, and all they tell you is to try reinstalling the software. Their flowchart for troubleshooting pretty much says ""if anything goes wrong, reinstall software."" When we installed it on a NEW computer that had next to no software, I bet my husband $100 it wouldn't work, but surprise of surprises, it installed the first time. Maybe this scanner just likes to be first.Also, don't trust any money-back rebate from Microtek. We are still waiting for ours, and we bought it about 9 months ago. We sent the form to Microtek using Delivery confirmation, they said they didn't get it, fax the stuff. We fax it, they said they're sending out a check. That never came. Now they say they're sending out ""another"" check. Let's see if we ever get that one."
5,Felicitaciones!!!Estamos encantados!!,"Es fantastico este DVD. Los titeres, la musica, el colorido son maravillosos. Yo vi el video con mis hijos como nos lo recomiendan en la guia para los padres y ha sido un exito, tanto en casa como en el day care.Ahora mi hija de 5 anos sabe todos los animales que aparecen en el video, los colores , las figuras geometricas, numeros(y lo mas lindo es verla ensenandole a su hermanito las cosas de donde nacieron los papas!!!!). Bailan y aplauden con la musica. Y a medida que mas lo ven mas lo disfrutan.Los valores familiares y culturales que nos muestran son increibles.Gracias por producir una producto de calidad el cual nos permite que nuestros ninos conozcan y disfruten Latinoamerica."
2,TooMuch information for Child,"Saw this book on Ellen tv show and wanted to get it for my niece. The concept is great, but there was a section that had a gun in it. Having this discussion with a 4 1/2 year old was more than I bargained for. Again, a great concept, just not ready to go over this yet with her."
5,Parakeets love this large cage!,I had a difficult time deciding whether or not the bar spacing would be close enough to keep my two young parakeets in and the cat out. It is PERFECT! The quality of construction is very high the birds love it. If you have a parakeet that needs more room - this is THE cage for you to order. I highly recommend this cage and the vendor shipping was fast and reasonable! Thank you!
4,Nothing's Gonna Change-,"It's pretty cool stuff. Denki Groove can mix some great beats! If you like techno, I suggest you look into getting this cd."
2,Several things,"Several things- I don't think it's too hard to borrow off a classic story to try to make a cute book- so I would not go overboard stating this book is super creative.Another thing- I don't like the language and tone of the book, and just think it's wierd. I know it's a kids boke, and a joke, but it's got odd lanuguage for a kids book...and I promise I am not a super-conservative...but the underlying tone is violent....Here for example:""Now I am usually a calm fellow....I go a little crazy""""And do you know what that little porker answered?""(About the 1st pig) "" he was dead as a doornail, it's a shame to leave a good ham. So I ate it up""""And your old granny can sit on a pin""I think it's negative, and crass.I have to give it atleast a 2 beacuase the illustrations are phenomenal though!"
5,Such a cute book,I remember reading this book when I was young. My students love it and it's great to talk about idoms and puns.
4,Fun to read over and over!,"This book is as much fun to read the 100th time as it is the first. (Trust me, I have...) My 5 year old got it as a gift and neither of us can get enough of this delightful ""twist"" on the classic tale."
4,The Lying Wolf,"I really liked this book because it was funny! This book was funny because it all started with a sneeze and some sugar. He needed the sugar because he was making a cake for Granny. So he went to the piggy's house to borrow some sugar. The first piggy's house was made out of straw and the second piggy's house was made out of sticks he sneezed at both houses and killed both of the pigs. Finally, the wolf went to the last pigs house and he was the smart one and built his house out of bricks. The wolf sneezed there and the house didn't even budge.Then he had to go to jail,but he still didn't get his sugar!I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO KIDS MY AGE AND I'M 9THE TRUE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS!"
5,The best kids book,Do you really know the story of the three little pigs? How would you feel if you got thrown in jail because you ate a dead pig or because you stood up for a family member when a pig made fun her. Read this exciting and hilarious book that will have you laughing on the 1st page and you will know how the woolf felt. This is a book that you will read over and over again. Somthing even your kids or your grandkids will read. The book is just one of a kind so buy it.
1,Inferior product,The inferior quality of the mounting and preparation of the slides made these almost useless with a microscope.These seemed like they were hastily prepared and never inspected. The educational value is questionable and likely to frustrate any student that uses them.
4,Very nice,I bought this product and a microscope for both of my grandsons for Christmas. They still enjoy them. They are both 8 years old and it introduced them to a whole new world.Nushka
5,A great idea for the first microscope,These area great idea to get with the first microscope you buy your child.My boys are 5 and 6 and were too excited on christmas day to take the time to prepare their own slides with the kit that came with the microscope. A box of these and they were satisfied.We can try preparing our own one rainy day!
1,"Horrible, awful!","This is a piece of crap. That is the best I can say. Half the time the monitor didn't work or the video was bad. Our handheld couldn't pick up a clear video when we were standing next to the camera. We got the manufacturer to replace it, which was a ton harder than it needed to be. The new handheld device we received worked okay for a few days but then the channels would no longer change and it started picking up both channels at the same time. DO NOT BUY EVER!!"
3,Good but disappointing after their concert,"I purchased this CD after seeing TSO play Beethoven's Last Night in concert. TSO needs to re-record this CD because the personnel and the music has changed considerably between the years 2000 and 2011. The concert was 5+ stars (see TSO live when the opportunity arises), the album after seeing the concert only rates a 3. The first 9 tracks are not great however tracks 10 - 22 are excellent. If you want to get the full flavor of what TSO is like this decade check out the Night Castle CD. That's 5 star music."
5,"classic TSO, but a little darker and edgier, perfectly blended with classical Beethoven","I really liked this album. I'm a pretty big fan of TSO, having seen them them for the first time on PBS during a pledge drive. I loved the darker tone of the vocals and the lyrics. They told a story, with a lot of the songs being ballads. However, the thing that shines the most in this album is still the thing that makes TSO so great, their expert blending of classical and rock."
4,Best TSO album ever,"Fans os TSO won't be disappointed in this album. Read the album notes prior to listening as this is akin to a rock opera. Knowing the story behind it makes the songs more enjoyable.This is heavier on the rock, as opposed to some of the more mellow Christmas albums.The tracks that featured a rock treatment of classical music were outstanding."
1,Where's Beethoven?,"Don't order this cd thinking you're going to hear a lot of Beethoven because you are not. There are only bits and pieces of his music. It's mostly talking over dark, nearly frightening music with only smatterings of intelligible Beethoven pieces. I would have sent it back. It's just not at all what I thought it would be."
5,Wonderful music,I saw this live in concert and had to get the music. Trans Siberian Orchestra produces great music and puts on an amazing show....must see live
3,Good Album,"I have overlooked this album for quite some time. This is easy to do when you have most of this great band's stuff. I listened to it this morning and was pleasantly surprised, it was much better than I remembered. While probably for hardcore Earring fans only, it is a godd album that drives all the way through. Jane Jane and Quiet Eyes are two notables. Glad I played it again, re-discoveries are always nice"
2,Heroine deserved better,"Altho I try to avoid such books, I have read a handful of romances where the hero was actively in love with another woman before finally turning toward the heroine. I rarely believe in the HEA when a book starts this way and this one was no exception. The hero was in love with the Other Woman for 3/4 of the book and there is plenty of narrative shown from his POV so that there can be no mistaking where his heart lay.And despite, continuing to carry on an affair with the Other Woman, he had shown a dog-in-the-manger in regards to the heroine, his wife in name only right from the start so that when he does decide he is in love with the heroine, I didnt find it at all believable. Because he's a dog, period.The heroine was funny, lively, and upfront. I really liked her and thought she was wasted on the 'hero.'Tropes: Marriage of Convenience, Makeover"
2,Real Disappointing. (Age 12),"I'll say this first. DL fans, if ya wanta read this book go ahead but I bet you'll get sick of it after the first 150 pages or so. I'm still half-way through this damn book, its getting nowhere! The book drags on, I'd advise you to rip out the first 150 pages. Anyway there are also alot of editor mistakes. Forgetting the periods, changing around names... Doug why'd you write this book?! Non-DL fans, never start of with this book. I gotta go. Duty calls. See ya."
5,Some great grooves,"Billy is a great groove drummer. I like to crank this up, put on my headphones, and play along on my drums. A great learning tool."
5,Great!,Fabulous to know you can get these for the Kaboom product at such a low price! Theirs are much more expensive!
3,Smells,I have read reviews that state there was no smell but as soon as I walk into the bathroom I can smell it.
5,Better price than in stores,"This is a great price, and so easy to have it ordered and just delivered. Saved me a trip to the hardware/pool supply store! Works great, and lasts a long time. We have a smaller sized hot tub, so they last longer than if we had a larger one, though."
3,Still needs seasoning,"I like this pan, and use it often, but I still feel like I need to season it after every use, and I still use oil or spray when using it. I don't feel like it has that perfectly seasoned coating to make things just slide off it. I'll keep using it and seasoning it, and hopefully at some point it will be like that, but don't buy it thinking it really is pre-seasoned."
5,Love the lodge!,"This is my second Lodge pan. I have a huge one for big stuff, but I needed smaller one for bacon and other empty-nest type meals! I love the helper handle and the preseasoning although, I still seasoned it the way I did my old one. These are just great all-American pans!"
5,Cast Iron,"Love it, Love it, Love it. Buy it!!!!! You will not be sorry. Just follow instructions about never using soap and alwasy greasing before and after use either with oil or grease, and you cannot go wrong."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED!,"Look at the picture, it doesn't have ridges on the bottom like the one you sent me. Plus I paid extra shipping to make sure that I had it delivered in time to use this weekend. That option's out now. IF you happen to actually have a smooth bottom square skillet I'd still like to have one, but please NOT A GRILL BOTTOM! I'm using it for baking!"
5,Excellent!,"Excellent! Read the book, watched the documentary film. No doubt he was innocent, the real killer admitted as much in a death row documentary interview. Adams was indeed innocent and the system failed him at every step. Until this book I always believed ""innocent"" death row inmates were anything but. Now, I believe different. If you are a police officer you MUST read this book. Guarantee it will give you pause and enhance your investigative techniques in future endeavors...... I never thought it was possible a completely innocent man could be within hours of execution but it happened in this case. Watch the documentary to supplement the book."
3,review,"It is acceptable. I don't know how it will holdup as the material is very lightweight...time will tell..anyway, it was reasonably priced and shipped quickly."
3,"Not a cookie cutter, actually","Can't say anything about the cost and shipping but I believe this is not a cookie cutter. Japanese cooks probably use it to cut thin slices of carrot or radish into pretty shapes and float them in soup. I think the product is mislabeled, as it is paired with other cutters that are also meant for the same purpose, most common being the sakura shape. I think it should be labeled as a garnish cutter."
1,Tiny!!!,These cutters are much smaller than they look in the picture on the web site. I am very disappointed.
1,"Tiny, tiny, tiny",This set of cookie cutters is soooo small. I actually laughed when I received them. I also received them 2 weeks later after a screw up with the seller of these cookie cutters. Do not buy these. They really are awful.
3,Wow! How cool is Amazon?,"You can still buy Loudness? Too cool. It's been a long time since I""ve heard Loudness. Fifteen years ago they didn't speak very good English, but man could they rock. What Loudness cd has ""Lines are Down"" on it?"
5,Photography as Poetry,"I saw this book alongside more than fifty kindred at the Denali Visitor Center. We chose this for our table display book because it alone showed Alaska as the word itself defines - ""The Great Land."" This is the book Robert Service would have chosen to illustrate his poetry about ""the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder...the beauty that thrills me with wonder, it's the stillness that fills me with peace.""If you can't go, you are the poorer for it, but this book will enrich your eyes and your spirit.Lee in Tucson"
4,What I'd do for 45 minutes more!,"I'd say most other reviews have nailed it pretty well. But, you watch this and when your screen goes blank you say ""give me more Year of the Cat, Past, Present, Future or Modern Times."" (And even prior) You become so aware of the body of work he had those long 23 years ago, that this could have made for an incredible concert back then. Watch this with your very favorite significant other, adult beverage and all your CDs because you will want to have an evening with Al . . . . and wonder how all that time flew by us so fast!"
2,Not comfy at all.,"I have really bad feet even at the age of 36 and these shoes are not made for anyone that stands on their feet more than 2-3 hrs a day. Your feet are the most important part of your body and you need to support your weight with them. Change your shoes out every 6 months if you wear them everyday. Get over it, plan to spend no less than $100 on a good pair of work shoes if you stand all day."
2,Skechers for work,"I am a part time waitress who needed not a only a shoe that was slip resistant but also something comfortable. The shoe is in fact slip resistant but offers no arch support and feels harder than a rock to walk in. I would not recommend this shoe for anyone who has knee, leg, back, or foot pain."
2,Shoes Shoes they're made by a kid,I think there is a factory employing children made of plastic making other things made of plastic and these shoes are one of them. Very cheaply made. Not comfy at all. Would be probably better suited as a planter for begonias or a little place to store rocks or bugs.
3,Cute Shoe But Small Openings,"I just recently purchased these shoes. I really like them and they're cute shoes, but in my case, the openings of the shoes were way too small. I was unable to slip my feet into the shoes. I don't have huge ankles, but they're not tiny either. So unfortunately, I had to return them because there's no way for me to get them on my feet. The opening doesn't stretch either. This is the only reason I gave them 3 stars. Had I been able to get them onto my feet, I think I probably would have given them a 5."
2,Not true,"They run very small and its almost impossible to get your foot in your true size. If you order these, order a larger size."
5,A hard look at reality.,"I chose this book with the slight hope that I would gain a greater insight to men. Even though I have had only 3 relationships in my 46 years of age, times have changed. My last relationship of two years ended but in reality it never was sound.I felt this book made all the excuses I had been given, become so much clearer now. When I wanted to believe the lies and give him the benefit of the doubt, I should have listened to my instincts.This book has given me a new insight to what men are really saying behind the words 'committment and I love you' when their actions are saying the opposite.I'm not synical of 'men' but next time I will remember what I have read and will move slower in a relationship to make sure the men I date are Keepers and not Losers.This is a book worth reading. Thanks guys, I appreciate your honesty."
1,Much better books out there,"I am a woman who bought this book looking for more details on exactly what the title says: What Men Want. What this book gave me, unfortunately, was what I would hear from a group of guys at a tractor pull, not from men I really care about. I've read the other ""hot"" men's books out there, like What men don't want women to know, and they seem to be much more potent (maybe because those guys are anonymous!). I guess it's hard to write a book when you know all of your future girlfriends, present girlfriends or wives, etc. are going to be reading it! Anyway, I wasn't impressed with this book at all."
2,"what ""some"" men want","While I appreciate that this book reveals what three men want to share about their understanding of men's minds, bodies and feelings I would rather have the book be titled ""what some men want"". And I'm not sure that as a woman myself that I'd want one of those ""some men"". It reflects men as adolescent, insecure, entitled to their ""ways"" and suggests that professional men deep down have needs that are just plain old there and that's it. The book left me wondering where the decent, hardworking, genuine men I know fit in. They are out there too. The book is rather two dimensional in this regard. It looks at men rather superficially without an appreciation for the depths of their psyche. I'm not sure I'd apply some of the ideas to Canadian men either. If the book reflects typical American professional men, then it's a sad state of affairs (sorry about the pun). But then, I'd be leaning towards calling them ""boys""."
3,"sometimes true, sometimes less so","As a single, straight male I am one of the people the authors are writing about. So as I leafed through it, I asked myself: to what extent are the authors' generalizations applicable to me?I thought the first few chapters made sense; these chapters focused on general statements that I think would be true not just of most men but of most women as well: for example, that men fear rejection and like women who like them.The second half of the book is a little more culture-specific. The authors write, for example, that women should accommodate ""a man's need to be out with the guys, his sports fanaticism, his craving for staring at a variety of naked women, and his gift shopping panic."" Perhaps these generalizations are true of the authors and of many other American men; but at least some of them don't apply to me, and I suspect they don't apply to plenty of others. (And no, I'm not saying which ones!)"
2,Can you say.....DOORMAT?,"This book is great if you really want your relationship to consist of responding to every irrational whim of your mate, dress like (and look like) a barbie doll, and not have any opinions or needs of your own. If you thrive on relationships where you are not valued and are relegated to the role of trophy, I guess this is the book for you. If you want to develop a somewhat healthy relationship with equity, I would look elsewhere."
2,PLEASE-TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,"SO,MEN WANT WOMEN WHO WON'T CALL THEM AFTER THE FIRST DATE, WHO WON'T BOTHER THEM ON THEIR GUYS NIGHT OUT AND WHO WON'T HAVE SEX UNTIL THEY HAVE GONE ON A SECOND DATE. GUYS LIKE TO GO TO BACHELOR PARTIES, GIRLS WHO DRESS SEXY FOR BED AND WOMEN WHO KNOW WHEN TO BACK OFF AND NOT GET TOO CLOSE AFTER A FIRST DATE. I DON'T NEED 3 ""PROFESSIONAL"" MEN TO TELL ME WHAT I'VE KNOWN SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS FUNNY IN A WAY, AND MANY THINGS THEY WROTE ABOUT WERE TRUE, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ""PROFESSIONAL"" MEN NEVER MENTIONED CONTRACEPTIVE. ARE WE WOMEN TO ASSUME THAT IS STILL OUR RESPONSIBILITY? COME ON! BEING PROFESSIONAL MEN, YOU SHOULD SHARE EQUALLY IN THAT REGARD. GO CUBS!!!!"
3,"Some good, some horrible advice","I bought this book to learn more age-appropriate montessori skills for my toddler. For that purpose, it is a good book.The problems come when the authors start talking about Cry it out and abandoning small infants. Terrible advice, and has been decried by every expert in the field. They also attempt to tell breastfeeding mothers to never nurse an infant to sleep, and to go ahead and wean by 9 months (which is against aap guidelines of at least one year, and who guidelines of at least two years)It seems these authors have taken the independence thing way too far. They should stick to advice on toddlers, since they obviously know nothing about infants."
5,"For $15, a great intro to montessori education for infants","This is a $15 book, not a $3,000 Montessori certification program; so my expectations were not that high. I think it delivered what it promised---it gave me a different way of approaching how I interact with my baby that I think is both nurturing and supportive of her independence. A great introduction to Montessori education, as far as I'm concerned."
4,What a great voice - reissue again please,Johnny was a star before N.E. and this voice showcases the adult feeling and emotion...great lyrics and he moves a man to want and love a woman.
2,Description does not say how small it - really is,I bought these for my 12 and 10 year old grandsons - for the beach this summer. The description did not say exactly how small they were! They were way too small for their heads. Should have had in your supply and description - sizes: S _ M _ L!Very disappointed! Grammy M.
2,Pick something different,It's been a while since I have used this dvd but I was not impressed and I would recommend buying a different hip hop workout video.
1,Not realistic,"I've followed quite a bit of adoption stories that a bio parent contests from the start and this movie fall short. In many real life cases (the Vaughns, Baby Emma Wyatt, Baby Jessica and Baby Richard) the father's right were not terminated. The prospective adoptive couple fights for years and eventually has to hand the child over (in one case the child was 7). There is no happy ending for them. The real parents don't give the child back to the prospective family after fighting. Many (not all) prospective adoptive families get divorced. This movie glosses over reality to make it something that it is not."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this movie with high hopes, only to be very disappointed. The book was wonderful and showed the power of the Lord in a wonderful way. The movie had nothing to do with the Lord, it is like they took the heart and soul out of the book and made a movie of what was left. Wish I could return the movie. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY! If you get a chance to read the book do it, but save your time and money and don't bother with the movie. Karen how could you allow this to happen???"
3,So Disappointed,"I read this book and couldn't wait to see the movie. I missed the showing in my town and was working on driving 1 1/2 hours away to see this movie. I was so excited. The movie was pulled before I could see it. When it was released on DVD, I thought I'd buy it because I knew the book was so good. I must admit, the movie is good but not near as good as the book. So much is left out that draws you to the adoptive parents. I also felt much more Christian emphasis was in the book than the movie. I still love Karen Kingsbury and will continue to get her books but I may rent future movies before buying them."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the book, I was really looking forward to seeing the movie. While the acting was good, the screenplay was adapted too much to try to appeal to mainstream audiences, thus losing its message. There is no reference to faith, especially Joey learning to pray and using prayer to help him through the stays with the Porters.This film is okay but, it is too far from the book for fans of Karen Kingsbury."
4,Pretty Good,"As far as getting a good cardio workout in this one, you do! You do sweat and feel it at the end. BUT when it comes to kickboxing, this workout is more dancey and not so much drills. I prefer more martial arts and drills than something with choreography. But I do like some of the segments like jump kicks and the ""kick walk walk"" --the lunges at the end too are good.Not my favorite with kickboxing, but I do use it and definately sweat!"
3,"I'm not a fan, but I could see someone out there liking it...","This was my first Amy Bento DVD and I'm not a fan of it. I could never really get into the video because the music did not go with the combinations. Amy is sloppy with her moves and coming from a background in karate I was really disappointed. If you could get over the poor form, bad cues, and over crowded set then you can get a decent workout from the video. Maybe it's just me and not liking her style, but I was not a fan. It is definately more of an advanced video, and if you can get over all the flaws you can get a good workout. If you want a decent video look at Cathie Friedrich, Katrina Barillova, or even some of the Firm videos. Billy Blanks is also decent and has somewhat of a different style than the others."
3,"Amy, What are you Doing!","I do like this DVD and feel that it provides some great workouts! However, this is not for beginners and Amy makes technique changes pretty quickly. Its upbeat, fast-past, and will give you a terrific workout...if you can keep up!I think it would be great if all DVDs such as this had small segments that could be viewed prior to purchase. And, to be very superficial, they could have gotten some better people to stand in behind her."
1,A total JOKE!,"Although I read the customer review on this, I still went ahead and purchased this book on-line. What a waste of money, this book is an insult to the average human being's intelligence! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I wouldn't even give it one star, but this system will not let me submit my review with less."
1,"100% Generic, 100% Useless","This title has no specific information on Property Management. I bought the book looking for information and advice on how to start my own company so I could take my own landlord business to the next level. What I got instead was generic information on registering your business and time management, then a brief appendix on Property Management. I promptly returned the book. Don't waste your money."
4,Finding your way through life. - Urban Teenager,"The book reads like a diary and covers many topic 12-15 year old kids might experience growing up. A good read with urban flavor. The setting in New York City in one of the poorer areas of the town. Things many not be the best but these kids stick together and try to do the right thing. They end up deal with issues of drugs, sex and problems with there families. It about growing up and making the best out of what you have. The book covers many controversial topics and many of the discussions in the books do not use proper English but for any kid who already reads well, this book could help guide their teenage years.-Overall I enjoyed reading this book."
4,"A review of a few songs, not the entire album","No tengo esta album..solamente algunas canciones from this album on an old tape. But what songs they are ! The guitar in Rebajas de Enero gives goosebumps of thrill. This is one of the few really classic rock songs I've heard from Sabina. Wisqui sin soda is another enjoyable song, as is Ballad de Tolito. I'm tempted to buy this album."
2,Not what I expected,"Have heard Steven Wright on the radio - hilarious. Purchased this DVD w/high expectations, but am disappointed. None of the funny lines I've heard before are on this SHORT-lived live comedy act. Most of the DVD is made up of a movie he did that I really never understood, nor found interesting or humerous."
5,Amazing,"Finally he puts put another DVD since his 1985 HBO special. I got a chance to see him in Canada so I know this DVD is great, you get over 2 hours footage. You won't be disappointed. He is one of my favorites along with Mitch Hedberg, Austin Peterson, and Dimitri Martin.Enjoy."
1,CD Review,"Not a great CD. Just 3 good songs, the rest you really can't listen to it more than once. I am disapointed from Natasha..if you like that style of music I think 'Oumeima' is better."
4,Byrd Flying High on Fine Tone,"Byrd may not have been a virtuoso, but his beautiful trumpet tone and pure soul are standouts on this lovingly restored 1961 recording. Top-drawer players of the time joined Byrd and baritone sax man Adams on this one. Their version of ""Stardust"" is unforgettable, and upgrades my rating of this record a full star from 3 to 4."
4,excellent,"Wow: What a pleasant surprise. Years ago, I picked up this groupsDry Your Eyesa Philly Soul album Van McCoy produced in 1967. This was very, very sugary, with washed out audio . The album had its moments--the title track not being one, but was not a standout.This is: The production is totally different--well balanced, and lush without being creepily sappy. The vocals are excellent, and the dynamics have a much better range. I don't know if Gamble and Huff had a hand here, but their type of perfect tightrope act between sweet and nutra-sweet soul comes off fantastically on this.Soul really was a producer's medium, especially in the 1960s, and this album shows me how good a great band can sound when moving from the wrong hands to the right ones."
4,"Hard starter, becomes a page-turner","Yes, there's a surfeit of fancy words. Yes, there are some detestable characters. But it's also a ripping good read once the author gets going. My copy was a gift, and at first I was turned off, but soon I couldn't put it down. I cooked dinner with my nose in it, I stayed up late, I used every excuse to do errands where I'd have to stand in line, just so that I could have more time with this page-turner. The unhappy result is that I finished in two days and now I need another book to read...."
5,great score,"whether or not you liked the movie, this score is unforgettable... great for theatrical use...I loved the fanfare in this one..."
3,Good - Could Have Been Better,"This book, where highly informative and detailed in regards to cataloging which songs were recorded and when - lacks the same attention to detail in its narrative. The amount of information given for each recording session seems to be based on the author's interest in it. For example the author glosses over many of the soundtrack recording sessions by intimating that he believes them to be inferior and without substance. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not, but an unbiased and uniformed account of the actual day of recording - no matter what was recorded - would have made this a better book."
1,Purchased product not as advertised!!,"I was purchasing the items first and foremost because of the images on the plate, Thomas and Bertie. My special needs son who has Asperger's and Autism to name a few really relates to them and his current plate (same as shown on sales item) is wearing.I had looked at other web sites and could have gotten the plates I received (Thomas and James images) cheaper, but I was looking at the images displayed on the product above.To get the dinnerware sets that were pictured would have made my son very happy.To get the set I paid for and received I am very disappointed, especially as I had to pay additional shipping (through my brother in-law) to get it to Canada.No longer a fan,"
3,The Fugitive Kind,Honestly the only reason I purchased/read this play is because I had to for a college class that I was taking. All in all the play was alright; I never would have chosen to read this on my own. This play wasn't bad; I did like it better than some of Tennessee Williams' other plays. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you really enjoy the works of Tennessee Williams.
5,First rate comedy,"If you like Airplane, the Naked Gun, The Pink Panther, or Gone With the Wind, you'll love The State. Original laughs, subtle jokes, and trust me, you can watch it like 100 times. Get it at any cost."
5,the best...EVER,"This was the greatest show ever to be televised. when it went off teh air, i was devistated. Now this is the only momento us State fans have left. I had almost forgotten it until a friend put it in at a party. At first people were mad that the music was turned off but after only a few sketches the whole party was rolling...the video was played over and over..my advise buy 2,incase you ware one out. My only wish is that there were more"
5,Monkey Torture,"I peed my pants because this was so funny. For more zany humor, please see Wesley Willis. I especially like the song, ""Jesus is the Answer"". And by the way, men cannot grow beards in space!"
4,Very Informative,"A very well written book; easy to read, even for the lay person. I highly recommend it."
4,Very plausible synthesis,"Klein tells the six million-year-old story of human evolution from a ""splitter's"" perspective. Accordingly, H. habilis is distinguished from rudolphensis, and the Asian H. erectus from the African ergaster and the European antecessor. Neandertals are accorded some humanity, but are treated as a separate species. They evidently lacked the inferred genetic mutation for modern speech that supposedly arose some 50 kya. While Klein avoids any mention of the earlier evidence for speech, and argues away inconvenient dates, he offers a coherent synthesis of all the recent data."
5,The Big Bang of Human Consciousness,"This book, along with The Human Career by the same author, is one of the clearest and most detailed accounts of the evolution of man, and points directly to the insufficiently appreciated suddenness of the human transition to behaviorally modern man (as opposed to anatomically modern man). While I don't find it convincing to think this the result of some sudden mutation, the presentation of the facts is very balanced, and the result suggests something more than the usual Darwinian account, which seems implausible when confronted with the clear picture of sudden origins. The result seems more like punctuated equilibrium than the standard paradigm. An important book.John Landonauthor ofWorld History And The Eonic Effect (Amazon)(with a discussion of the issues raised by Klein)"
5,Given as gift. Prompt delivery.,Since I bought this item as a gift. I can not rate the item. But the receiver loved it. I recieved it before the delivery date. Which was nice.
4,A great collection for die hard Bon Jovi Fans,This Box Set contains 4 CD's and a DVD of mostly unreleased songs.This is not a Greatest Hits set.This is for the Bon Jovi fan who has everything else and wants more.I grew up in the eighties and had both Slippery When Wet and New Jersey on vinyl and have followed this band for the last 20 years.They are part of the soundtrack of my life and I have all of there albums.I have felt for along time that while they are a very good band there need to be the biggest Rock Band out there and to sell albums has stifled there creative edge.This Box Set proves that this band deserves to be considered one of the best bands of the last 25 years.Every song on this set is good to very good.There are 15-20 songs that could have been hits.If you grew up in the eighties like me and like Bon Jovi I highly recommend this set.It showcases a side of the band rarely heard on there studio releases.
5,Not your typical box-set,"Apparently ""Fruit Loop"", the first reviewer of this product, knows nothing about this box set and has definitely not listened to it. This is not a ""best-of"" set. Your old favorites are not there. In fact, none of the songs ""Fruit Loop"" listed are even on the box set (other than a rare demo version of Living on a Prayer included as a hidden track)! Why review something you do not know about?Anyway, this box set contains 50 rare and unreleased songs. 38 of them have never been available anywhere before. The other 12 are rare b-sides or bonus tracks from other countries. The songs are from the 80's all the way through today. I think this is a great concept for a box set, rather than just giving the fans material that they already own. Leave it to Bon Jovi to be innovative and give the fans what they want.To the other reviewers out there, please do not review products that you haven't taken the time to find out about, much less have actually seen or heard."
5,"100,000,000 FANS CAN'T BE WRONG: BY BON JOVI","LOVE, LOVE, LOVE BON JOVI, I ONLY BOUGHT THIS SO I COULD HEAR THE SONG WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD BUT I LIKED THE OTHER SONGS TOO, THANKS"
2,Hardrock slowly dies with this album...,"I don't like to say it, but Bon Jovi is getting worse with this album. As a huge Bon Jovi fan, I bought this album immediatly and listened to it. The first month I loved this album and I played it over and over, but the second mont the songs became annoying and the lyrics made me sick. I was bored of the same lyrics and the same ""messages"" in the songs. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a great Bon Jovi fan, but this album doesn't deserve a place in the Bon Jovi collection..."
2,"Yes, they can be. They are.","For fans, I suppose this would be a rather big delight; for non-fans, it's nothing that will turn you on to the band from Jersey. They had some okay, cheesy hits in the '80s - but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays."
3,Great stuff but poor presentation.,"You would not put this book down--an engrossing book. Organization of the book keeps you wanting the following: 1. Graphical presentation could be added 2. Time Line graph showing the history of Space Exploration in the U.S and U.S.S.R 3. Introduce subjects prior to using their names or nick names in contexts. One example, an international reader like me may not know who 'Ike' is. 4. Definition of technical terms"
3,Bizzy Bone is the man,"The song by Bizzy Bone on this CD is awesome. He goes the fastest I have ever heard anyone go in a song. If you listen to the end of his first verse, he burns up the track. I may be saying this just cuz I love Bone Thugs and have all their CD's, but this CD was worth it just to get the Bizzy song. I don't care about any other songs, I only listen to Way 2 Strong."
2,one excellent song,"the whole cd itself is not very impressive however the song ""Get Involved"" by R. Saadiq and Q-Tip is EXCELLENT! It has such a good beat and rhythym to it. If there is a single availabe for this song i recommend that you buy it and forget the entire CD."
3,Good long scale bass carrying case.,It great for short traveling distances and just for store a bass it's great. I have a Fender P Bass and a Squire 5 string J Bass and the both fit perfectly one at a time. If you are a musician and can appreciate good storage for a multiple of bass guitars this makes sense and is affordable. If your doing serious gigs spend the extra money on a better case.
5,Fantastic,I ordered a bass for my teenage daughter & wanted a high quality case. The case arrived within two days and exceeded expectations. The price was fantastic. I would highly recommend to others.
3,"Okay, but not Salvatore's best.","I would say that I was disappointed, but I wasn't expecting a Dark Elf Trilogy. The characters, especially the main character Luthien, were not very well developed and rather simple. Oliver was interesting, but he was the only developed character. Luthien, the main character, just was not that likeable. I never found myself cheering for Luthien, but Oliver was cool. The plot is ok, but I didn't really find the cyclopians very interesting for bad guys. Some of the things within the book were well written and interesting, but it would hurt anyone's view of the book when you are comparing it to his Forgotten Realms masterpieces.Salvatore is still a great author, but I would recommend reading all of his Forgotten Realms novels before tackling this one. There are so many great fantasy books out there you can probably find a better one you haven't read, but hardcore Salvatore fans might enjoy it."
4,If you want action,"If you want good adventure story with a lot of battles, heroes, villains and magic creatures, well, this is your book. The story of Luthien is hardly original, but it is extremely interesting. You can not put the book down, so... I reccomend it."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","Salvatore's blatant lifting of names and characters from various sources, most notably Tolkien, makes it difficult indeed for me to take this novel seriously. Perhaps it's not intended to be completely serious, but Salvatore's calling his main male character Luthien (a very important *female* character in Tolkien's mythology) and his native land Eriador (the western part of Tolkien's Middle-earth), not to mention Oliver deBurrows, a ""halfling"" thief whose dialogue is almost lifted from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" really did me in, even though the story itself is not inherently flawed."
5,more great stuff by salvatore,"what can i say, i've been reading him forever, and he dosn't disapoint me at all. the characters are lively, and while ouraggeus at times, fun as hell. Oliver nad luthien are a great duo, with witty banter and fighting galore. just pick it up, you'll love it."
2,Not very durable,"I have the first version of this mag, and they are not good, you get a lot of misfires after some months of use. I don't really know about the newer versions though."
3,Wordy,"If Mr. Burke left the long convoluted descriptions of every cloud, river, tree etc. out of the novel it would have been a good 175 page mystery, instead it is easy at times to forget the story line, while worrying about what kind of fish might be lurking in what pool and how our hero is casting for said fish. I assume some of the folks in Western Montana may not totally agree with the makeup of Burke's residents, but it is fiction. Certainly not a waste of time, but could have been much better."
2,Bitterroot leaves a bitter taste,"I am long-time admirer of James Lee Burke's books and I think I have read all of his Dave Robicheaux novels, as well as a few others set in different locales. Let's hope he soon returns to Louisiana. Montana does not seem to provide him with the same inspiration. Bitterroot reads like a bad parody of Ernest Hemingway, overlaid with a patter of homespun philosophy and pop psyschology. It is filled with tortured similes and other forced descriptive devices. Perhaps his publisher expects a new book each year, but I would prefer to wait longer rather than seeing a fine writer waste his talent.."
1,not for gerbils,"We have two gerbils, Guinness and Harp. Even though this product is colorful and appealing, it is better to get a 40 gallon tank with a hardware cloth lid. The gerbils chew diligently on the tubes and will eventually escape."
3,Not as useful as I thought it would be,"This didn't cover the topics I wanted it to, but it may still work for you if you are learning to use Captivate. It is definitely easy to read and use, if that is your priority, but it didn't tell me much I didn't already know. I purchased this because I was running into some brick walls while using Captivate and the book was touted as containing some tricks and tips. Honestly, I think the software itself is restrictive, and it isn't the author's fault that they couldn't remedy Captivate's shortcomings."
3,Only for those who like for the dead to be covered.,"Overall the CD was put together well, but the musicians could have made it a little more upbeat. It doesn't compare to the ""Jazz is Dead"". I enjoyed the song selection better than ""Jazz is Dead"". If this CD was done with the same producer, but different musicians, and add the lyrics, it would be excellent. If you think you might like it, buy it. If you have any doubts, don't buy it."
4,Solid quad Knockin' follow-up,"This is the earth-shattering follow-up to the knockin' debut Kings of Bass. RX and Fury outdid themselves with this! I have such great memories of this album. I bought it at Musicland or the Wherehouse at the Arden Fair Mall on 8/13/93 when I was on my way to see Jason Goes To Hell the first day that movie came out! See how music, any music, can stir up old memories of where you were in your life when you first heard it? This album brought me much joy in the following year of high school! Ahh, memories!"
5,A joy to page through,"We all experience it at times, and this book reminds us that there are angels among us in different guises and all walks of life. New York City is a living testament to all the countries of the world living shoulder to shoulder in peace and Panja Jurgen's vision of this understanding began well before the events of the past few years. Her tribute couldn't come at a better time. The photographs are evocative and bold and at times heart-wrenching, but always insightful and often amusing. With the reflections on the nature of peace in ourselves and in our world woven through the pages, it helps us to remember the precious parts of life in an increasingly frightening world. The next time you speak with your mailman, next door neighbor, or that strange fellow you see on the street, look for some wings glimmering behind them."
4,great item. did not fit my toaster oven,"Beautiful stoneware, sturdy. Unfortunately, I must have measured incorrectly because they didn't fit my toaster oven. The good news: Amazon took them back, no problem!"
3,I don't beleive 90% of it.,"I'm a science mayor and it's hard for me to beleive most of the book, however I did enjoyed reading it."
3,Not for the skeptic...,"I found it to be a very entertaining book. As an open-minded skeptic myself what I found most interesting was getting inside the mind of someone who's life is based on religious belief. The episodes of her life described were truly amazing and up to a point it made me really question the ""paranormal"". However I couldn't feel but a bit of apprehension caused by the clear personal bias of the author. She never ONCE mentions a case of her psychic failure. (she does mention that she is human and she makes mistakes with her gift...but no example of her mistakes are given) Also, it would be nice if she gave someone concise sources of documentation, more so than just her word. Even though I am much more open to ""psychic"" powers and other unexplicable events, I found it very difficult to absorb some of her teachings are ""absolute truths"" with no proof. However, if the books purpose is to give people hope, then by reading the other reviews, I can say the book serves it's purpose."
3,Just another average spirit guide book.,"If you've read other such books, you'll get no new informationhere. Sylvia's psychic ability is presented here as a ""gift""from God, and I have no doubt that she's very intuitive. My doubts arise when she begins quoting her spirit guide, Francine. Francine's view of the afterlife is just a bit too idlyllic. In other words, it sounds as if she's telling us all exactly what we want to hear, not what we should hear. Sylvia's stories of her life are the most interesting parts of the book. But, what troubled me was her claim that it was somehow more difficult and traumatic than any other person. In fact, her life seemed fairly average on the trauma scale. All in all, I did enjoy the book and read it in 48 hours. Just make sure you take your grain of salt, there is alot of self back-patting in here. She has lots of hits, it seems. But no misses."
1,"This is NOT a new, original, book...it's a new title","Warning to potential purchasers...this book is simply Ms. Browns previous book ""My Guide, My Self"" with a NEW TITLE. The chapters are identical, the paragraphs are identical. While it is a good book, don't waste money buying a second copy of it like I did!!! I'm very disappointed that neither Amazon nor Ms. Brown had the courage to tell us that! Do they need our money so badly that they must misrepresent this book to increase sales?"
5,"Absolutely wonderful, positively insightful!!","I have seen Sylvia Browne on television several times and since the first time I saw her, I felt that she was truly a gift from God. Even so, I didn't realize that she had faced so much sorrow in her life. Now that I have read her book, I see that she has had to deal with and overcome so much in her life, not to mention learning to use her gift to the best of her ability to serve God and to help others. And throughout it all, she has maintained a terrific sense of humor which is still very much a part of her today. I am more convinced than ever what a truly wonderful gift from God she is. I feel blessed to have been made aware of Sylvia. She shares openly and honestly about the other side and the meaning of life in general. Her book is an absolute must read! I look forward to any future books by or about her."
2,Disappointing,This book was a disappointment. It was much smaller than I was expecting and the content was superficial. The content was mainly commonsense with very little additional useful information. Almost nothing on showing. It was an easy and pleasant read but not the right purchase for someone seriously interested in cat breeding. I felt I had wasted my money.
5,All-Around Music Lover,"This is the best aussie pop punk band I've ever heard. They're also the only aussie pop punk band I've ever heard, but oh well. The songs are excellent from beginning to end, with great guitar licks (though not very complex, don't expect anything groundbreaking) and a really good singer. Their lyrics are great, as is their sense of humor, if you watch their music videos. They are my favorite pop punk band, much better than the more mainstream bands like Blink-182 (which I am not fond of). Be forewarned though: The song ""Not The Same"" is probably where you heard Bodyjar, because it was on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, and besides from that, is their most popular song in the US. Don't expect all of the songs to have that sound. This band does great experiments with their amps, and I love the sound - but it's not common."
3,Don't fix what isn't broken.,"I bought this cd yesterday on a complete whim. I saw some names I recognized: Information Society, Berlin, Boy George. Ok, so I took a chance. I was expecting an edgier grinding sound to the music. More of a techno twist. Unfortunately, I got that on maybe one or two songs. ""Live to tell"" sounds completely rehashed. There was nothing new to offer, basically. Some songs needed more bite. The title of the cd ""Virgin Voices"" had some reference to the the fact these bands are little heard of. Deep down inside I was thinking...SACRILEGE! They are messing in Madonna territory. But, I figured, they are giving an established artist's work a different spin. Honestly, you are better off sticking with the originals or the exquistely produced ""Ray of Light "" for the essential techno grooves you were hoping to find on this forgettable cd."
4,cool madonna and fun good cd,"thesse people mad because gothic rock bands doing madonna for one i like this cd what if i said to thesse people madonna was going to do rush,s subdivisions if you want madonna than go buy madonna cd,sfor one i think thesse artists are awsome thesse crybaby fans they can,t handle somebody who does their queen tunes than don,t by tributes!IF MADONNA covered rush thesse people would think that be awsome!it,s crazy but fun it has flaws but nice do this cd is awsome better than my rush tributes cd !thesse guys doing madonna is great for one i haven,t heard from madonna in 9 yearsthe people on this are doing on this cd is what most people in the pop world won,t do parising madonna thesse guys parise her beforethe pop world did"
2,Judge for yourself and listen to the samples before buying.,"My opinions on this CD stem from my enjoyment of industrial music and unique takes on cover songs.I agree with other industrial or techno fans that The KMFDM, Gene Loves Jezebel and The Voluptuous Horror Of Karen Black covers were really good. They satisfy my craving for industrial while providing a fresh perspective on hit songs.The Dead or Alive cover was pretty good as well. As far as most of the other tunes, I felt like I was listening to a close copy of the original. Is it a tribute to Madonna to attempt to perform and sing a song in the style that Madonna sang it? I don't think so. My idea of a tribute or good cover is to provide imaginative and creative angles on a classic song. A good example would be Garbage's version of a Beach Boy's tune in the song ""Push It"".Judge for yourself and listen to the samples before buying."
4,Fresh new takes on Madonna classics,"I agree with another reviewer. This CD is great by all means. The hard-core, ""I only live to serve Madonna"" people aren't going to necessarily like it, because they probably just want to hear only Madonna. A tribute CD is for other groups who want to do THEIR interpretation of another artists work. And this CD accomplishes that well. I am not a big Madonna fan, but I really like this CD."
1,Phheww! What an album of remakes or is it really tribute?,"I'm working in a music industry and everytime i've tried listened to every new releases by artistes or tribute albums. To me, these was the worst tribute that i've ever heard.I was really shocked when i listened to most of the songs done by those sort of 'weird' hardcore Artistes. Anyway, there's no comment for certain artistes/groups or band like Dead or Alive, InSoc. & Berlin cause i listened to their albums. To the rest, pls don't even try to insult her musics for the next Vol., maybe (hope not). Even Madonna,herself, do/did better covers or remakes in her own versions...To Madonna, i really can't wait for that version of yours ""American Pie"" by Don Mclean to be release soon.. Settle!"
3,Do You Remember Cutting Crew???,"The year was 1987. ""(I Just) Died In Your Arms"" was all over the radio. Everything seemed to be going in a new direction, including music.Cutting Crew emerged with a sort of pop, sort of techno, sort of rock sound. ""Broadcast"" has stood the test of time. This CD could easily be mistaken for a recent release.While Cutting Crew is neither especially profound or insightful, their music is uplifting. For 80's buffs this one is great!"
4,What a Incredible Album,"THis album contains great songs, great arrangement and excellent vocal performance by Cutting Crew. It's very moving, all the musics are so good that all could be singles. The only ""but"" is cause the song I've been in Love Before, here it is mixed in a way that cut off the instrumental introduction to previously track, and that introdution is edited too (less 7 seconds) and the ending of the track happens the same (fading out 6 seconds before the real end of the track).But the album itself, it's great!!!!"
5,Works great!! no more flees,Used the same day I got it. which was quick!! easy to apply and both dogs are now flee free!!!!
5,Super Series,"One of the Best TV series of the 80s. Too bad it only ran 2 seasons. Thanks to A&E for the reruns, but agree DVD of entire series is the way to go. Love the 60s Oldies music on the soundtrack. Do any of you experts out there know the name of the singer and/or song title playing at the end of the Julia Roberts episode?"
3,"Economics fascinating, strategy kind of bizarre","The first half or so is a very fascinating instruction on how our money system works. It was very interesting learning what actually causes inflation, and what inflation actually is. It's not a good thing, but not exactly the boogieman I thought of when I was a child and people talked about it. Very good.The second half of the book is a very clear product of the time this was written, and seems bizarre and impractical. The basic message: hoard everything you can. When inflation was in the double digits as at the time, this probably seemed to make sense, but he goes as far as recommending buying a second card and putting it up on blocks, because you'll need a new one in five years. All to avoid inflation.Well, as it turned out, inflation was killed by the Fed soon after this book was released, so that advice would have been pretty bad."
4,Brutal. Beautiful.,"As most reviews have already stated, Mads Mikkelson is brilliant per usual. He is an actor who makes you forget he is acting, not matter the challenge of the role. Stine Stengade is up to the task as well.Some here have said the story is too cliche or that it has been told so many times. So were Shakespeare's stories, almost all of them taken from prior source material. There are scant few movies you'll see that tell a new story. What makes a story is the way it is told (the film and director), the words written to tell it and the actors who bring it to life. And it's in those elements that this movie achieves its mastery."
3,"Great performance, but poor video quality.","The performance for this recording is on par with that of others of Die Fledermaus. Where it falls down is in the quality of the DVD. The color was off and faded in a number of places, and it is visibly a stage performance that was roughly adapted for video recording. One of the benefits of watching a performance on the small screen is that you can see greater detail of expression on the actors faces and your view is directed to the dramatic focus. It's like having the best seat in the opera, practically on stage. As such, this recording disappoints. Too many wide angle shots and set pieces that, while perfectly acceptable for stage, become distracting on screen.I greatly prefer the Vienna Philharmonic production, also available on Deutsche Grammophon."
1,Shipping & Customer Service was HORRIBLE.,"I tried contacting you 6 times, both on your official site and your Amazon website. You expedited shipping promised 3-5 day shipping. I got it in a week! I want a refund on my shipping please.It is kind of ridiculous."
2,Not really worth buying,"I don't see what people see in this album. I couldn't rate it a 3 even. There are about 3 songs toward the end that are worth having. It's a long way from Olias or Change We Must.I'm a Yes fan since 75 and Jon's voice is my favorite musical artistry, bar none. But this album is one of his weak ones, as he can produce.P"
5,Absolutely fantastic to the real Elvis fan!!!!!,"Though many of these songs have ben heard in several arrangements, it makes no difference to the real Elvis fan. In addition, we love to hear the laughter, and the comments, as tis shows us a side of the rel elvis few of us ever managed to get to know. You simply had to know the man to want to continue listening to out takes, etc. Just listen and enjoy!!!!! The only thing which could make it any better would be if there were more laughter or talk, or if Elvis were still here."
5,Fantastic,"Great album, i originally heard them on Pandora. Glad i bought the cd, i love all the songs. instrumental music at its best."
4,Quite a good book...,"This was a very easy and fast read. It's the story of a small town boy who's life is changed when his parents die in a car crash. He is then given the chance to become a lawyer with his parent's life insurance money, and he takes it.After graduating college, he gets a job in a prominent law firm and ends up marrying the bosses daughter. They have two children, and over the years he becomes richer and richer.As the years go by, he becomes more and more richer and finally gets himself into a large debt.Well, as I said the book was really good. I didn't really like the ending, but I was expecting what had happened for a long time."
4,Loved it,"Belva Plain has made another story worthy of being made into a mini series. I can only hope it happens someday! In this one, Robb MacDaniel's life changes when he goes to law school. He leaves behind his home town, as well as, ""the girl next door"". He marries another generous woman named Ellie. As time goes by, Robb's career bring enormous successes and money is no longer a concern. However, soon money is all that matters. Robb never understands that cash in the bank is not the same as owning as much as possible.Belva Plain also shows the effects all this has on Ellie, his two children, as well as the the girl he left behind all those years ago. Surprise ending! The thing I love best about Belva Plain's writing is that she can create a wonderful and realistic story, without using all the harsh language so many other authors use. Highly recommended reading!"
1,Very disappointing,"I have read all of Belva Plain's novels. This book was so disappointing. The beginning of the story captured my interest but by the middle it became boring. The ending sort of fell off a cliff--it was as tho the author couldn't think of an ending and it sort of abruptly stopped. The characters were stilted and I felt no sympathy for any of them. The main character, Robb, starts off with such high ethical standards and just throws them to the wind. It was so unbelievable."
3,my review,"Robb MacDaniel is a man who has had to struggle to have it all. However, life has lent him a hard hand. He has had to hurt people he loved. He tries to pay back by helping others. However, his early ambition comes to haunt him.Belva Plain writes a very compelling story here. Her characters seem very alive and you become familiar with Robb's struggles and happiness.Good book."
4,good roots here,"the gladiators released this album after being critized for losing their influential position in the roots world. in other words, the album was the group's attempt to prove their status as one of reggae's best band. and they did just that with this album. there are some old songs from the group's other albums as well as new ones on this album. the group does not hide that fact that they are highly influenced by bob marley. there are remakes of bob's songs (chatty mouth and talking blues) on the album. however, and i think it was a good move on the part of the group, they do not try to impersonate marley as so many reggae artist try to do but fail. i also recommend the gladiator's trench town (which was their first release and is a better introduction than back to my roots)"
4,informative true story that every parent should read.,a crucial read for parent of all children in the school system today. This mother's story will prepare a parent or guardian to recognize problems with children that performs well at home and on standardize test while the school faculty indicate the child can't learn. This book shows that sometime you have to go above the teacher's and yes the principal head to get the results you deserve in regard to your child's education.
5,Why is this so inexpensive?,"It's hard to imagine how they can build a unit this compact with this number of features and at such a low price. Just based upon the number of input ports, knobs, levers and electronic components alone this should cost a lot more than it is.More importantly, the sound quality will blow you away."
4,Does so much for so little. . . .,"Everyone's reviews are correct, but to put this into perspective, I lent my non-FX model to a friend of mine (which was a big mistake), cuz they trashed it, and a prong from the power supply that connects to the unit was bent. I purchased the 1202FX, and I never looked back. I use this for small events, and I have never gotten bad sound out of it. I rely on another Behringer mixer for my small studio. It's not what you have, it's what you do with it, and I'm proud to say I have recorded several artists (from hip-hop to R&B;, to Acoustic/folk music), and the results were better than I expected.Pick one up. . . .with it's size and ability to control every nuance in sound through analog means (pre-production), this is a great bargain."
3,Owner's manuel,"I'm sure the 1202 FX is all that it is supposed to be, I'd like to find out but the manuel is really insufficient."
3,"I just ordered this game a day ago, along with 'Black Mirror'","I've been reading some reviews here to give me some thought of to how this game will be mostly. I have not received this game yet, but I'm due to receive it in a few days by mail. I can't wait to play this one, and 'Black Mirror'. I have played 'Myst' before, and I have 'Dracula:resurrecton, and the other Dracula game'. I mostly play Battlefield:2 online or IL2:Pacific Fighters or RainbowSix games, and games like FarCry, Deadly Dozen 1 & 2, theres some other games I have to aswell. Anyway, from what I'm reading in here, alot of people have mixed feelings about this game. I sure hope this game turns out to be fun and I'll be back to write another review."
2,Disappointed,"My 4 yr old enjoys this tent, but we are disappointed that it does not usually stand up all the way. One of the sides almost always stays bent. It just doesn't seem to pop up all the way, even with the support bar in the ""roof"" in place. My daughter doesn't seem to mind, but it is always lopsided which drives me crazy!"
4,Not what was in the Box,"I have no problem with the product, in fact it's kind of neat. Lots of room and my daughter and son like to hang out in it, however, my box says castle, but it's not. Mine has two yellow flags and dosen't say princess on the top, any one else have this problem?Love the Product though."
5,18 mo. old granddaughter loves this house!,"Since our granddaughter visits once a week, we appreciate that this Princess House is easy to store in a walk-in closet and is easy to set-up and take-down. She loves playing in the house and usually insists that her mom, both her grandparents, and two poodles go into the house to sit and talk to her. This is her very favorite activity."
3,In Wall Speakers,"These were inexpensive, but their performance was lacking. Purchased 8 pair of AUDIO SOURCE AS6 speakers and have been very happy with those."
4,Great center channel for the price,"I bought this to be the center channel in my living room setup. I own the DV-62 for my home theater setup, however, my entertainment center couldn't handle the size of that speaker, so I chose this one instead.I've been very happy with the purchase of this speaker. It made a huge difference over my previous center channel (some KLH model). They say the center channel is one of the most important pieces in your home theater, and this one delivers on that promise.I'd recommend any of the BIC speakers to anyone. I have both in-wall and floor standing models in various setups, and I've been extremely impressed with them, especially when you consider how much cheaper they are than their competitors."
4,A hidden diamond in Mike's discography,"it is a music to ""Killing fields"" - a tale about cambodian civil war and terror brought by red khmers in eigthies and seventies.Mike did a great job and made a really moving soundtrack that brings to life whole film without watching it in the moment.with a use of massive choir,strings,lots of synths and slightly hidden guitar he creates a specific claustrofobic atmosphere (""Evacuation"",""Execution"") but also he brings some more hope into whole music (""Etude"",""Good news"").a great,moving music to a great moving movie.Get movie and the music as well - they both deserve it."
4,music that paints pictures,"this is oldfield's most visually evocative album ever. the music was so brilliantly matched to the action that every track brings a scene vividly to mind. a helicopter landing in a bombed out street, a cow being airlifted, the sweep of the cambodian fainforest, the horror of the killing fields. not so sure it won't sound weird if you haven't seen the movie, though. there's some serious sound experimentation going on here."
2,Laurel's iPhone/iTouch application more helpful than her books,"I've read ""The Pathway"" and have learned something about her system. The word ""somethng"" is used here because ""The Pathway"" doesn't go far enough to present Laurel's teaching in a package that's easy to understand. If you have an iPhone or iPodTouch, her application that costs just 99-cents, presents her ""solution"" much better than her books do. That's where I begain to understand the full method -- from the inexpensive application from iPod that makes Laurel's method most easily understood.Because I know this review won't sell books, I hope Amazon conveys his message to you."
4,Great but a little heavy for Lahey's no knead bread,"I didn't know how much I would be using this dutch oven for baking bread when I bought it or I would have paid a little more for the Lodge Logic 4 quart one with the big loop handles (model P10D3). This one is pretty large and heavy to take in and out of a blistering hot oven, expecially when it's blisering hot itself, and the bigger handles and slightly smaller size of the 4 quart one might make the job of baking a little easier and safer. But if you're strong and agile, this dutch oven certainly works for the purpose of making terrific rustic Italian bread.The only other fault is that it didn't come particularly seasoned (as it was advertised), but that's pretty simple to take care of."
5,Love it!,"Cooking is fun and the clean up is easy! This makes food taste better, I'm a heroine to my husband, and I am very pleasantly surprised at how quickly it cleans up. It's seasoned we'll and is just getting better."
5,Awesome Dutch Oven,I love my new dutch oven. I received it promptly and in great shape. There was no rust on it at all. I put it to use right away by making pork in chile verde and it came out great! It went from the stove top to the oven just like that. Clean up was a breeze as well. I can't wait to use this again soon.
2,Too Heavy,"I heard a lot of good review about this dutch oven, that's why i bought it. But after i received i was very disappointed. this pot is very heavy, and i returned it, i only got half of what i paid, because of the return shipping cost like $12 something."
1,Disappointed,"Very Disappointed !!!This Item is really, really bad. Everything I try to cook in it turns black and has a metallic smell and taste.Also my stomach was on fire from eating cocked food."
5,This is the Dutch Oven you want for indoor cooking,"Short review. This will become one of the most important pieces in your kitchen. I like the handles better than the other lodges, and NOTHING compares to cast iron.Alton Brown raves about this thing and for good reason. He also writes of a casserole pot, don't get it unless you are a chef. This works everywhere that one does. An excellent buy.My only word of caution. I love the loop handles, but IF you are one of the rare people who still cook with a campfire, get the other 5qt lodge."
2,I Returned It!,"After reading the rave reviews here, I thought that I would love this item. But I didn't and wound up returning it. First of all, when I received the item, I noticed that there was some rust on the cover. It did seem to be built pretty solidly and was pretty heavy. I then tested it out by boiling some rice. It did seem to heat pretty evenly, however, I noticed a heavy metallic taste to the rice. The rice was swiftly discarded as I didn't think it was safe to eat."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"It became rusty after first use! And moreover, my food turned black! Can't stress this enough, DON'T BUY IT! Really disappointed(("
5,Best Value Around,"This is one of the most basic and useful cast iron cooking items. I use mine exclusively for baking ""no-knead""-type breads, so I don't have to worry about seasoning issues. (I have an enameled pot for stovetop cooking and and braising meats in the oven.) In my experience the black iron bakes browner, crisper-crust breads than Dutch ovens with enamel coatings. In addition, with this pot I don't have to worry about melting the lid handle top at the high temperatures, 450-500F, that I use for bread baking. Use a recipe with 3 1/2 cups of flour to make the right-sized loaf for this pot. At $35, with free shipping, this Dutch oven is a great value and a purchase that will last many lifetimes."
5,Great quality,I am a fan of the Lodge products. I got this after getting the large griddle. We have used it numerous times and it is just bulletproof. The care is easy. Just clean with little or no soup to retain the non stick effect. Nice heat retention of even heat from iron.
5,Worth every penny,Husband bought me for a present... I absolutely love it... Would recommend to others... I do use mine every other day...
1,rust haunting,"I liked the handles and the look , however ; I should not have thrown out the box so soon as I received it. I cannot return it now. I cooks good, but I cannot get rid of the rust , I tried and tried. It does not worth the $42.21 , which included shipping and handling. It is a waste of my money."
5,TOP QUALITY!,"This dutch oven is fantastic, easy to clean & keep clean and it's made in America, a tip I have been warned when buying cast iron as the safety standards may not be as good and cast iron is so heavy, it can cause serious harm, but it's affordable so you can't go wrong with Lodge as it's simply the best cast iron around and the cost is about the same, but I'd pay more for Lodge just to be on the safe side. It's a good thing I don't have to pay more here:-)This one even takes to tomato dishes quite well, although I try not to, but the dishes I make in my cast iron dutch oven are the best! This is my 1st and only piece by Lodge as my iron frying pans are imported & 1 is not too good and 3 are a bit better, but compared to this......well there is no comparison! I need to replace my imports with Lodge and until I do, I'll just use this wonderful lodge dutch oven.Thanks again, Amazon for the fast, free S & H and another fine product."
1,Too small,I had one of these for our minivan that was about 2 gallon in size. This one is about a quart size. I should have read the description better. I returned for refund.
5,Dream-Like,"This cd is among Rowland's best.If you are on a quest for music to relax and calm the spirit, any of Mike Rowlands' cds will do just that.Hopefully you will gift yourself or someone else with this balm that will not only soothe but quite the soul and release it into a pleasant,dream-like state."
5,A True Talent!,"Jessica's debut CD is by far extraordinary! She's got one heck of a voice for such a young age. However, I did see the reviewer who compared her to other teen singers like LeAnn and Lila...why is this necessary? Can't people appreciate the talents of all these young artists? There is room for all of them to be stars! Why do people always seem to think there can't be more than one country star who are teenagers? Jessica most definitely is a star -- that's for sure. Her strong and powerful vocal range and emotion are what makes these songs stand out. I think ""Unbreakable Heart"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard. She does it well as she does all the rest of the songs on this album. Jess - you're truly a beautiful talent with a bright future ahead of you! Keep it up!"
4,Very good album for a beginner,"I love all of the songs except for two, but those aren't that bad. I really enjoy this album. She has a wonderful voice and is going to be a star!"
5,A Classic!,"Marnie's book is the definitive work on sexual addiction issues in women. This book will no doubt inspire many who have suffered in silence to seek the professional help that is needed. Marnie shares her story in a powerful way that will inspire the reader in their personal journey of healing. This book is also for the friends and family members of people coping with sexual addiction issues. Not only does Marnie provide great insight into managing addiction, she shares a vision for life beyond addiction. This book will become a classic in the field of addiction. Speaking as a professional counselor working in the field of sexual addiction, this book will be a tremendous asset to the profession."
4,Calming,My Tai Chi instructor uses this CD and I liked it enough to buy it. It features the true Oriental instruments rather than the cheesy keyboard synthesizer that creeps into some of the meditation and new age music. A couple selections had a contemporary feel with use of piano; I'd rather stick to the Oriental instrumentation but all the music is interesting and very restful and serene. I am happy with my purchase.
2,Murderer,"One of the members of the group (Labrant Dennis) currently sits on Florida's Death Row for the murder of his child's mother and her ""friend."""
5,C&B Reviewer Tanya Bates -,"Alvin Morrow explains the methods of the Willie Lynch Letter in terms that anyone can understand. The ability to break down these effects are uncanning. With each new chapter, Black men and women are able to see how these brutal mental conditioning methods first used in slavery, affect each Black person today. Also, honest solutions are provided to promote unity, allow for healing, and ultimately freedom from these damaging mentalities.Rating: 5"
1,Not Good!!,"I just purchased this item - I am returning it. Tigerdirect has been great however, the product does not accept .wma files with licensing. So, if you download a song from a digital music store - you can sync it but it will not play because it doesn't support the licensing file. If this is not an issue - the buttons worked but, there was a slow response time from pressing them and the unit responding. Features were good but product definitely came up short!!"
2,Outdated,I purchased this book for a class I am taking in graduate school. The book is cumbersome to read and severely outdated--especially when it comes to cultural considerations. We had quite a conversation in class about the book--not flattering.
3,It's NOT pink!,"I WANTED PINK!!! But, even though I called ahead of time and said ""It absolutely HAS to be pink so don't even send it if it isn't pink!"", I got a black one. Un-freakin' believable. It's going back."
2,I'm a huge Moore fan.... but not a fan of this book,Moore is about the only writer of comedy that I find worthwhile reading. I believe I've read all but two of his books and I've loved them all (Lamb and a Dirty Job are my favorites) but this book just didn't seem up to the standard of his other work. I felt it was very very slow to start and even once it go up to speed just wasn't that interesting a story. I love reading Moore b/c he rights the kind of books that have me laughing out loud as I read and I just didn't feel this book was all that funny. I still enjoyed the story and writing style is certainly Moore.... but thought overall it was simply weak in comparison to his other great works.
5,Great book,Love this author and I lost my original copy some how. Finally found a copy online and purchased it immediately. Could be more satisfied with my purchase. Got the book fast and in great condition. Have purchased several more of Moore's book since and have been completely satisfied with each purchase.
3,OK album with an outstanding song with Sinead O'Connor,"Beautiful music by The Edge, but a little bit boring if you listen to it for a long time. The song, where Sinead O'Connor is on vocals is enough for you to buy the album"
4,"Blood, Blood Everywhere","Evan and his family are moving to Atlanta. The only problem with this is that Evan has to go to his weird Aunt Kathyrin's. Aunt Kathryn is totally deaf and can't hear a thing. She has refused to learn to lip-read or learn sign language. Evan hates it over there. Aunt Kathyrin also has this creepy black cat. What does the cat have anything to do with it? We'll, let's just say curiosty killed the cat. Anyway, the only company Evan has at his Aunt's house is his cocker-spaniel Trigger. Then Evan meets a girl who lives a few blocks away. Her name is Andrea but everybody calls her Andy. Andy and Evan go to this old toy store in the town to find a birthday present for Andy's cousin. While in the shop Evan finds this cool can of Monster Blood. He buys the blood and takes it home. But there is something very strange about the Monster Blood. It keeps getting bigger and bigger. The Monster Blood turns out to be a horrifying surprise."
3,Demon Rumm,"A reprint of Sandra Brown's Loveswept romance, Demom Rumm is sheer escapism with an almost implausible romance forming between hot-shot actor Rylan North and Kristen Rumm the wife of the deceased aeronautical daredevil Demon Rumm. Yet Ms. Brown manages to acquit herself with crackling sexual tension between Rylan and Kristen. Rylan is the alpha-male bad boy actor who stays with widow Kristen Rumm to mold his screen role as her husband. He ends up falling for her while learning her struggles as Demon's wife. The deft dialogue and pacing helps to bolster the formulaic premise and as usual, Brown's acumen in seizing the emotions of romance readers renders this a serviceable read."
4,"Wonderful Concert, But Who Picked These Songs?","This is post-electric PT at his best, backed by one of the best ensembles of studio muisicians around at the time. The sound is to die for and the band is tight as a drum. However, I have the concert video of the entire performance , and the song selections on this CD really stink. You'll never know what you missed! Too bad."
2,Too few songs,"For those who are complaining that this cd has too few songs, the full twenty-two songs are now available on a two disk set via Townshend's website Eelpie. And part of the proceeds go to charity! Finally!"
4,Good overview of Holistic Health,This book has a good overview of Holistic Health. I'm using it in my Holistic Health class and find it very interesting. The read is easy. It gives you a general idea of the different types of Holistic Healing.I especially like the list of vitamins they have in Chapter 2 or 4. It talks about what the vitamins are important for and what food it can be found in.
5,Great hamburgers!,"Really useful for your kitchen. The only thing I don't like is a) It's a bit expensive b) They should sell more burger containers separately (or at least in 4-packs, 8-packs) instead of buying another set. If you're having a picnic it's hard to go with just 4 hamburgers for everybody :("
3,"First try, then buy","When I heard about this new album, Beaucoup fish, I could not wait to get it. At the CDshop it was not possible to listen it first. Unfortunately, because I think I would not have bought it. Although all tracks sound OK, the innovative mindblowing innovations just don't come up like they did with the two former albums. Maybe it is just too much to ask, after such incredible albums Dubnobass.. and SecondToughest..."
4,"Fine work, chaps!",The album grabs you and keeps you listening intently for the duration - beautiful work - Underworld have managed to evolve and keep ahead of the styles...
5,Perfect again.,"Buy this CD. And buy their other ones. I used to listen to only techno, but then I drifted away from it because it seems that it lacks soul lately. Well, not so with Underworld. While they're one of the only techno acts I still listen to, they remain one of my favorite bands in general. This album is just full of perfect songs, from the first to the last."
3,not as good as the others,"this underworld album was okay, but it wasn't as god as some of their other albums. my rating is a 3/5 because it had phat beats, and a little bit of mixing goin on. they used the synthesizer too much, though, and i liked underworld better when they were progressive house guys. they try to spin trance! it's funny. buyt dubnobasswithmyheadman if you want a really good underworld album, not beaucoup fish."
1,"Maybe it's me, maybe not.....","I just don't see this as an overall ""strong"" record. Although I have enjoyed many of Underworld's songs in the past--I think 2 maybe 3 songs stand out on the CD and the rest is unlistenable. I don't think my opinion is due to the fact that I just don't ""get it"" or I ""don't appreciate art"" because I like a diverse variety of music both new and old--this CD's just not all that. Get Backstreet Boys or Britney Spears instead...."
5,An old favorite,"I first read this book probably more than 20 years ago...since then I have bought two hardback copies. The first someone borrowed and did not return it. The second one does not leave my house. If that is not an indication of how good it is, I just bought it for my kindle. It is about Eric Collier and family moving to Meldrum lake, and moving beavers in, and shows how having beavers back in the area affected the whole ecosystem..."
3,Unfortunate debates going on here,"I've just been reading all the reviews and it's quite sad to see and feel the anger going on here. Breastfeeding or bottlefeeding is a mother's personal choice and I think mothers should be respected on whatever decision they make in regards to feeding choices for their infants. What a sad situation in this society to have people ""feed in fear"", feel guilty and throw insults at each other for fear of the wrath of either side."
1,A thinly veiled attempt to debunk latest medical advice,"I just hope anyone considering this book knows that it used to be titled ""Bottlefeeding Without Guilt,"" which should tell you something about the author's real motivation here.I agree with some of the other reviewers....save your money and try something else if you really need support. Perhaps your doctor can refer you to a group or something else that could be helpful to you.The author here is just content to rant about how some people believe that breastfeeding should become the recommended form of feeding infants (which incidentally seems supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization) and that makes some mothers who can't (or who don't want to) breastfeed feel guilty.I honestly feel sorry for mothers who CAN'T breastfeed....a group that the author seeks to make larger for some strange reason......but why attack those who do? There is no reason to feel guilty if you feel confident about your choice."
1,What an angry woman!,"It is terribly sad that Peggy Robin did not receive the information that she needed to breastfeed. However, she has launched and attack on La Leche League in an attempt to make herself feel better. LLL is made up of woman who volunteer their time to help other women interested in breastfeeding. Her information is flawed and her attitude hateful. I'm happy that Peggy Robin is outnumbered by thousands of women that have found LLL loving and helpful. If a LLL Leader ever showed Peggy's bitter attitude toward a bottle-feeding mother they would certainly not be worthy of acreditation in such a wonderful organization."
1,What a waste of a tree!,"Peggy Robins sounds like a very guilty and bitter woman. I know now that I am not alone with finding this book a complete joke. She has misinterpreted flimsy data and twisted it for her own use. Most of her statistical information is laughable. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this "" guide to bottle feeding"" is really one woman's personal anti-breastfeeding soap box. What a waste of a tree! Mother of two totally breastfed, illness-free, and brilliant children!"
4,"You can do away with the ""Sopohmore Jinx"" here!!","She really couldn't lose with the Neptunes behind her anyway..............honestly, think of a wack track the Neptunes dropped for anyone........hmmmm?? I couldn't recall one either. Maybe you can recall an artist you didn't like but the track was surely blazing if the Neptunes had anything to do with it.Kelis 2nd addition will without question justify her ground as one of the top R&B stars to emerge from the underground scene and he past 3-4 years. Her vocals haven't missed a step, creativity is sure on point and that over all ""Kelis flow"" has this CD occupying the 13th slot in my CD changer and for a long stay.....I'm not sure why this was released over seas 1st. Maybe she didn't want to be including in the long line of B.S. artist that we see in American music lately.......but anyway.....I got my copy and lovin' it!oNe"
1,If I could give it zero I would,This book contains no really usefull information for ISDN configurations on Cisco routers. A real waste of time.
4,Nice Ring,"I Bought this ring a few years ago- it's trendy and has a nice appearance, although it does bend (and mine did eventually snap, after heavy use and being beaten up a few times(I'm rough on all my rings)). It's a cool small ring, but I like it nonetheless, and will probably buy another!"
4,This one will keep you thinking about what happened...,Great twists and turns and special effects. Hard to be believe this is an indie film. Bravo!!
3,"Not the best, not the worst!!","I think we all need to give her a break! I mean sure it is not the best I have heard, and yes she should stick with acting, but what is wrong with her trying something new?? Would you not want too?? Why do people give such a hard time to actors who try singing? I mean lots of singers try acting, and lets just say some movies have gone horribley wrong because of that. So to sum it up I would say that it is not all that bad. A couple songs have a really good beat and are great for dancing. I would give this cd a B+ and that Lindsay can make more cds or stick with acting, it does not matter."
4,Suprisingly Good,"After reading all the reviews on Amazon.com, I expected this cd to pretty bad. But after listening to the song samples , I found out that it was pretty cool. The only thing I didn't like on this cd was that all of the songs sounded pretty much the same. (Don't get mad at me but if you like this cd, you should buy Hillary Duff's cds. Why does everyone hate her?) So far, the only song on this Cd that I don't like is To Know Your Name."
5,surprised,"i must say i was hoping for the worst after listening to a few tracks on mtv.com. but after listening to the cd beginning to end, i feel that it is a very good first album. i think she can grow a lot but i think this is definitely a good step. i want to see her perform live. the only thing i dont like is the cover i think it looks tacky and she could have done much better."
4,LL's first CD is pretty good for a first try,"I really do like this CD. I think shes got a good voice, and the lyrics are good... Something reminds me of Hilary Duff, who I don't really like. But I'll get over it, because I like LL as an actress and now a vocalist. I got this CD yesterday, so I hope to get more attached to this CD.I think that most of the songs range from 3/5-4/5. Only Symptoms of You, First, Rumors, and Anything but Me are better. The lyrics are ok, the vocals need a bit of work, but overall the CD is a 4/5."
5,Linsay Lohans The Best!,"This is the best albums, I've listened to. Lindsay Lohan is one of the best singers. I love all of the songs on her New C.D. This would make a great stocking stuffer, and a great gift for someone. Congratulations Lindsay!"
1,Not another bad singer,"Lindsay is a very talented actress BUT not very talented in music. She fits in with all of thoes wannabes also known as Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson and many others. What has happened to good music? The Beatles, for example, were from the 60's and people still play and love their music. In this generation there are no classics and there are not going to be any. I am a teenage but I know what is good music and this IS NOT GOOD MUSIC AT ALL. in one of her songs she says ""tell me that its over"". Well Lindsay I'm telling you that YOUR SINGING CAREER is over."
2,DOWNLOAD THE GOOD TRACKS,"THE ONLY GOOD SONGS ON THE C.D ARE RUMOURS, VERY LAST MOMENT IN TIME, + OVER (DOWNLOAD THESE). The rest of the album is 100% FILLER MATERIAL! Lindsay Lohan tricked people into buying this C.D via the release of 'rumours' (which is without a doubt the BEST track on the album). I WAS SHOCKED that the rest of the album is NOTHING LIKE 'rumours' but sounds like a pathetic copy of Hilary duff's latest album 'fly'. 'Very last moment in time' is a typical feel good pop/rock song which sounds like it is taken from a movie soundtrack + 'over' is listenable BUT NOT GREAT. THERE IS A REASON WHY I-TUNES SELL $15 PRE-PAID CARDS 2 DOWNLOAD MUSIC, PLEASE EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT 2 TAKE REVENGE ON SINGERS WHO DECIEVE THEIR FANS. IF U HAVE BOUGHT THIS C.D DEMAND A REFUND, U DESERVE MORE FOR YOUR MONEY + DON'T U FORGET THAT!"
1,"""Rumors"" was misleading.","First I should say, I'm more of a hip-hop/rap/r&b; fan. I bought this album because I love the single ""Rumors"" and assumed the entire album would be hip hop based, unlike Hilary Duff. Boy was I wrong. Not only was ""Rumors"" just a BONUS TRACK, the entire thing was rock (pop-rock..whatever). If you like Ashlee Simpson, Hilary Duff or other pop-rock, you'll surely like this album. Hiphop lovers, stay away, even though the song ""Rumors"" is excellent.This isn't a very thourough review because I really didn't enjoy this album. Not only can she not sing (check our ""rumors"" live at sessions@aol and you will see) well, I didn't like ANYTHING about this album, with the exception of ""Rumors""."
1,Garbage One Hit Wonder,"Rumorz...that will be the only hit song in this girls career. I see why she chose that to be her first single release. The rest of the cd sounds like a bad rip off of Hilary Duff(who I might add actually has talent). So take a little advice consumers, save your cash. I would rather waste my money on a Britney Spears cd! Now that says something!"
1,Oh please...,"I onlygave 1 star to this album cuz I can't give negatives stars... The girl can't even ""sing"" her own song... what was that GMA perfomanca? plz... I actually heard the cd on mtv's the leak to see it if it was worth buying, IT'S NOT!!! don't waste your money on this... buy a Green Day album instead! or if you want pop music, go with Gwen Stefani... or of course Hilary Duff! but c'mon I have nothing against her, but this cd just sucks! the only good track is rumors and it's because of the funky beat cuz her voice sucks... the worst track on this ""album"" is speak... awful, and the next single ""over"" is just as bad... DON'T BUY IT... trust me on this one..."
2,It's an OK album,"Yeah, at first my best friend said that this was a really good album! So I decided to buy it. When I first heard it, I was like, this is what I bought? I was a little dissapointed. I thought she would be better than this. It's like, the album you listen to once or twice, then you're done with it. You can DEFINATLY tell she smokes. Her voice is pitchy. VERY pitchy. Sometimes, the notes she doesn't really hit, and it sounds awful. I would rather listen to William Hung."
2,A much less talented version of Hilary Duff,"Some people should just NOT produce an album. . . . Lindsay Lohan is one of those people. She should really stick to acting. She can't sing. The best part of her songs are the instruments. Her songs are catchy, but not good, and rather annoying. I only like 2 songs on the other album, the rest annoy me. Honestly, Lindsay, stick to acting!!"
4,Solid Job Lindsay,"I gotta say, I'm not really a fan of hers, but most of the tracks on this album are pretty solid. Not really what I'm used to hearing from her, but it's good that she's doing a variety of things now."
4,she is fine,wonderful album lots of good jams i liked speak the best but rumors is also up there as on of the great ones only thing is she needs to get her own style some of the songs sound a little britneyish but over all i liked it
2,Could do MUCH better!,"I'm disappointed. By watching all of Lindsay's movies I was excited about her music career. But when I got her album it was disappointing. I reckon the only good song was 'Rumours.' You could do much better, Lindsay!"
1,18 Going on 30--What happened to the Role Model?!!,"My preteen daughter listened to Lindsay's cd at a friend's today. This was going to be her top item on her Christmas list, but after 1st being shocked & disgusted by the cover & flippin pictures inside, the music was not enough to overcome the disappointment. Has Lindsay forgotten the fans that made her so popular?!! They are much younger & less ""experienced"" than she is. She would do well to remember her roots. Too much too fast. We won't be buying it."
1,Awful! No more please,"Please no more tween/teenage actress releasing CD. Lindsay's becoming the next Britney Spears, and that's even insulting to Brit! WTF, her CD debuted at No.4 on Billboard's Album chart? Has the music world gone mad? Her career will fade away in 3 years at best. If you want a real artists, I'd recommend Michelle Branch, Mandy Moore or Leanne Rimes. Go away, Lindsay Please!"
1,what a tragic waste!,Lindsay has a beautiful voice...too bad she didn't show it on this album! The songs on the album are good pop songs - but the fact that Lindsay decides to be just another popstar is dull and will not be helping her become a serious actress or singer. She needs to do something different!
3,Totally Unexpected!,"When i kenw Lindsay Lohan's gonna release an album, i thought it will be sucked! But after it released for weeks, my friend told me that he bought it and he said that i should check it out. So, i bought it, and it was totally unexpected!! The songs are great! Loves it! I'm not saying that ALL the songs are great, but most of'em are really hot! Loves it! And so, if you're willing to buy it, good for you. If you're just thinking of buying it, it wouldn't be a huge lost if u didn't buy it."
2,Please don't,"So, Lindsay Lohan has joined the ranks of people who think just because they make big bucks in the movies, they can become a great singer. Sure, some people can pull it off, but those are the people who have talent.I loved Lindsay in ""Freaky Friday,"" and more so in ""Mean Girls"" because she does have acting talent. As for her vocal talent, she doesn't have a powerful voice. Her singing isn't totally bad--she'd be good in a musical group, just as long as she doesn't sing lead. Lindsay doesn't do well singing solo because she can't hit those high notes, she barely makes it to the low ones, and she mostly screws-up everything in between. This is really shown her in her album, unfortunately.[...]."
5,That's Hot!!!!,"Hey,guys.Lindsay Lohan can definitely sing.she just need more vocal practise,that's all.Rumors makes me hit the dancefloor,Over is an emtional awesome song while First...not so sure yet.But she's good."
3,A Stretch,"When it comes to making a good album, new [...] can only do so much...Track 6 was particularly good."
2,2 stars= truthful,"talent in music= only barely co-wrote 4 songs.music hits= this album is her only hitmusic flops= ""rumors,"" ""over""why no success= barely showing/or has musical talent, is kiddie star, & on disney radio""first"" was played on disney radio today. seems like she'll never be a true talent in music! stick to acting, unless you songwrite or produce most of the album & show talent!"
4,Great Album,"Anyone who think Raven, Hillary Duff, or Lindsay Lohan can't sing or act are crazy. They are great and good at what they do. Really this is a great album.SPEAK IS JUST GREAT(...)So buy it and rock on like I did!"
5,What [...] is wrong with ya'll?,"[...] Do ya'll have ears?This is a great debut album. It mixes pop, rock and trance together. The mix of this album is awesome.First- 8/10 great album opener.Nobody 'Til You- 8/10 love the music.Symptoms of You- 7/10 the chorus isn't that great.Speak- 10/10 3rd single awesome song. This is where the trance was mixed in with pop.Over- 10/10 2nd single. This is a awesome ballad. The vocals are great.Something I Never Had- 8/10 good song.Anything But Me- 9/10 pop mixed with rock.Disconnected- 9/10 another great slow song.To Know Your Name- 10/10 definetly my favorite song on the album. This is the song that mixes pop, rock and trance together. I hope it becomes the 4th single.Very Last Moment In Time- 8/10 great lyrics.Rumors- 10/10 1st single again pop and rock mixed together. Great song.This album to me is perfect. Most of my favorite types of music are on this album. Overall rating 9.5"
2,Did Not Like It,"I did not like Lindsay Lohan's debut. John Shanks's production was good, but it did not save Lindsay's very weak voice. She sequels in her songs too often, it sounds like she's using voice enchancing all the time. I also don't like that she didn't write her songs. Lindsay is an MTV fake! Ugh! I was looking forward to a decent album with Lindsay-written lyrics, but I didn't get that! Don't buy from this fake!"
1,Disappointing at best,"When my 7 year old daughter received this as a gift, before even hearing the music, I was very disappointed when she opened the CD and there was a very provocative picture of Lindsey -- not the image my 7 year old needs to have. Things got worse when we opened the CD jacket further only to find a picture of Lindsey with both of her middle fingers prominently displayed. I'm disgusted and she has now been banned in our home."
5,A Lot Better Than I Expected,"Speak has eleven great songs. They all have a hard rock edge. The mixing and Lohan's powerful and emotional vocals make for a very pleasant listening experience. I have to say that this is one of my favorite CD's. The best songs are the first three tracks. The main themes of all the songs are love, desire, and a longing for privacy and independence."
2,Hilary Duff Is My Girl!!!!,Hilary Duff is far more talented than Lindsay Lohan..... Also Hilary Duff looks WAYYY better than Lindsay.. I love to listen to Hilary's voice because she can actually sing!!!!!!!!!!
2,Is this music?,"I really just have to applaud Lindsay Lohan for her ability to blatantly copy Britney Spears and still get away with it. I give this album two stars for that! But other than the total lack of originality or thought, there really is nothing special about this album. Lohan is a very talented actress, and also has a very beautiful voice. But, this album shows none of her talent or ability. Try again Lohan!"
2,Not the next Britney -- Music wise.,"Music-wise... Lindsay doesn't cut it. She is definatly no where near the good music of Britney Spears.However, with that wasted-music contract running around known as Hilary Duff, she does beat some of her competition. Unlike Duff, Lohan's voice doesn't get totally on your nerves as she has some sort of emotion backing the words coming out of her mouth -- Unlike Duff who ""sings"" without emotion and in one tone.But when it comes to the pop sensation of Britney Spears, she doesn't have it. Britney's first 2 albums still reign supreme. I'll take Baby one more time and Opps over this any day.Outside of their carrers... Lohan is just as trashy as Britney, only without the charsima and like-able, upbeat personalty of Spears.Acting wise.. The girl has talent, unlike the joke known as Hilary Duff and the girl with dead acting talent, Britney. But that has nothing to do with this album."
1,Very Dumb,"I hate Lindsay Lohan's first album Speak. Her songs made my eardrums bleed from beginning to end of this crappy album. It hurts! This is annoying. All of her songs are very corny. I got rid of this album, and bought real music. I'm extremely annoyed about crappy manufactured pop junk! I perfer listening to anime music and real music with real singers & real musicians. Say no to manufactured pop! Don't buy this crappy album."
1,Not even a 1.,"We have yet another cd coming from yet another pop sIut-sicle manufactured in Hollywood.Do NOT buy this CD.It sucks more than Paris Hilton could at a drunken frat party.Lindsay can't sing, and all that synthesizing can't hide the lack of talent she has.This is a worthless cd that will probably sell well despite its crappiness because1) ""She's sooo cool and pretty and she RAWKS, i wanna be just like her!!!!!111!11"" type sIut-sicles-in-training love herand2) Pathetic excuses of the male gender want to shag her and pop those implants of hers.Don't give in to this Hollywood crap. Listen to some real music."
2,umm.......,"Charlie who says about the Hilary stuff..... I have a couple things to say to you,1. Learn how to spell her name!2. Hilary is very talented and she is way more than Lindsay3. That may be your opinion but it's annoying!!Hilary Duff is awesome, she had gone more through Lindsay and she is still better than Lindsay... now I will stop hating Lindsay cause I like lindsay too.... she is a great actress but I have never bought her album.... I have listened to the album once and I was very dissapointed, since then I haven't... but in the other hand I have ALL Hilary's album.... she is very talented. But Anways I do like Lindsay it might not sound like it but I do! Lindsay and Hilary BOTH Rock!! but in my opinion I like Hilary way more!! P.S. YOU BOTH ROCK :-D"
4,"Gov't Mule, short story long","Being familiar with GM for some years as I was, imagine my delight, as I shipped my daddy's ashes up north (final road trip for the old man in the Lincoln) after making a stop at Nervous Charlies just north of... uh is it Nashville or Memphis, one of them places. Fahrworks, as we like to say in southern Ohia. Daddio was on the dash, and Afro Blue with C. Leavell came on the radio station. I tell you what, we had the perfect road music. Don't tell me the old man wasn't appreciatin...We were driving north between Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, did a very nice dodge while on the Gulf...I just didn't trust the ashes to be mailed so I waited until the last minute to get out of dodge...now, I ask you, is there a God? Yup, at least in my final party book. CYA"
3,Sadly ONE song REMIXED...,"I guess for the money I spent: $10.10....I expected a bit more. This isn't a thing against Irene Cara, I love her...It I guess is the seller..I was bambooZled...lEsson, Learn, I will keep the CD however.If your willing to spend EXTRA $$$ buy this CD if you like to spin one song in multi versions. I do however find the song uplifting...because I do like her music and the over-all intent of the message in the song."
5,These speakers are incredible!,"The BIC AMERICA RTR-1530 speakers really sound amazing and are an excellent buy. The previous reviewers were 100% accurate in their assessments of these speakers. The 15"" woofers pack alot of bass and the mid-range and tweeters are sharp and clear. The best money I have spent in a long, long time. I highly recommend these speakers!"
5,Great Speakers!!!,"For the price you can't go wrong. After i received the first one i ordered the second one with in fifteen minutes. They are sold as a single speaker not a pair, so you do have to order 2."
3,STAY STREET!,I have been a fan of Mr. Riley as from the first Guy album. I have almost all he has ever produced. I really feel it's a shame that the presure of producing an album that everybody has to like has resulted in this disappointing piece of work. I know you can do better TEDDY. You can't be everything to everybody. Stay with the core fans!STAY STREET!
5,Blackstreet Gets Better With Each Album,"This album is definitely the Shhh! I have all the Blackstreet albums and I must say that this is Blackstreet's best one yet. There's slow songs, fast songs, and flat out Jams! I bought the Enhanced CD version with ""On the Floor"" as a bonus track you could only listen to on the computer. My only complaint is, why is one of my favorite songs so hard to access? It's alright though. I think the collaborations are great, and every single song is worth a thousand hours of airplay. Thanks, Blackstreet for making one of the Best Albums of the Year!"
1,Finally they have a wack album!!!,{Finally} compared to {Another Level} is a wack album . The songs on here aren't hitting at all. I have to listen to {Another Level} just for me to keep from shock. I guess Silk or 112 will be my favorite male R&B group now.
1,Disappointed,Mega disappointed in this one. How could a group who had an absolutely brilliant song like U Blow my Mind (my all-time favourite) come up with this stuff? I was really looking forward to the release of this album and couldn't understand how they changed so much.
1,It is great,The music is great and the words are great. It is fantastic! I gave it one star because I was lying!
1,Weak. Just weak.,"I don't see why people are always talking about the ""Sophomore jinx"", because the second albums from most people(including Kurupt, Nas, and Black Moon) are pretty cool, but the third albums often aren't very good. Look at Jay-Z and TLC, Nas. They all made good sophomore albums. They all disappointed me with their third albums. Blackstreet did two great albums(although I hate most pretty boy R&B sh*t), and this one stinks like a skunk. I only liked ""Think About You"". The rest is garbaggge!"
5,Excellent time saving menus,"In anticipating major foot surgery, I purchased this book to prepare and freeze 2 -3 weeks worth of dinners so all my husband would have to do is reheat a meal each evening. Each meal makes more that enough for just the two of us. I was able to fix a different meal each night, and freeze what was leftover. Everything was execellent and very simple to fix. The flavors stayed after freezing and reheating. We especially liked the spaghetti sauce. I will never buy spaghetti sauce again ! The menu ideas were appreciated also. I found that I can substitute lower fat ingredients in some cases without lessening any flavor. This will be one cookbook I will use quite frequently."
3,Good Concept But too much Meat,"I really like the concept of this method, but I can not use the recipe schedule in the book because every single one of them is a meat dish. I would love to have a vegetarian option available for the next edition (hint hint). As it is, I do intend on trying it out and adapting the plan to a less meat oriented menu."
2,Too much work for too little reward,"I was attracted by the concept of this book - home-cooked meals there when there wasn't time to prepare them. I decided to try the two week entre plan first and gradually assembled the ingredients over a couple of weeks. I set aside a Sunday when I knew I could work almost undisturbed. This was some marathon! Discounting preparation the night before and clear-up it took me nearly 12 hours. Still, I thought it may be worth it. The draw backs of the meals are the necessity to plan and remember to defrost the night before (they take at least this long to thaw). My family are also less than enthusiastic about the recipes and also claim they have that frozen taste. I may use a few of the recipes in future and cook those in bulk (the spaghetti sauce was good) but otherwise this is not a project for our family."
4,5 hours of cooking makes a smooth month of dinners!,"We love this cooking plan. The book includes shopping lists and delicious recipes. Freeze the sauces in zip-locks, then simply heat later and add fresh pasta or rice and salads. Unfortunately, the publ. tells us it is out of print. get it while you can. Im buying 4 today."
3,New Edition?,"I just recieved my new edition of Once-A-Month Cooking first written in 1986. I was dissapointed in the fact that the only new things added were a two week plan and table talk questions in the back(okay there may be a few more things). On the front cover it says that they are now including a low fat recipe plan but that was included in the old book. All of the recipes are the same as well. I am in favor of the book and love the idea which I will be trying myself soon, but was hoping to see new recipes so that some friends and I could trade books. Anyway, do recommend the book but was only dissapointed in the new edition."
1,"Slow, dull, tiresome","I was very excited to get The Ritual Bath to read on my Kindle after reading many glowing reviews. I could not have been more disappointed. The pace was slow, the characters uninteresting. The main character, Rina, spent the book alternately cleaning and cowering from noises outside while waiting to be rescued by Decker. I read half the book and will not finish it. It was unpleasant and a total waste of time. If I had a hardcopy of this book I would throw it in the trash. Do not waste your money or your time."
3,Kind of a slow start to a series.,"In this first in the series, Peter Decker is called to handle the rape of a woman inside a Jewish complex. Although I enjoyed the informative part of the book which dealt with the mikvah and the other rituals of the Orthodox Jews, the character of Peter Decker seemed one-dimensional and wooden. The attraction between Peter (and outsider) and Rina is an interesting twist when you condsider that Peter was given up for adoption and raised in a Baptist family although his birth mother is Jewish. However, Peter's and Rina's growing attraction for each other creates an interesting storyline, and hopefully the author will be able to develop this character (Decker) into someone who isn't quite so one-dimensional."
4,Excellent Reading,"I have never been disappointed by any of her books nor her husbands, for that matter. I am an avid fan of her Decker/Lazarus novels and can't wait for the next one."
4,ok,"I am not into pop music anymore, but I got to admit these boys put on a fantastic concert. When watching it at home you can't help but to dance along! Great show."
4,Guerilla Learning How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With or Without School,As a certified teacher and a Homeschool mom I found this book to be a great work cumlinating many important aspects of Education in general. Many of the suggestions offered to Homeschoolers in the book are attainable and filled with basic common sense. The basic premis of the book is Learning happens naturally every minute of every day (Life is one big school) we as parents and eductors need to remind ourselves and others of this basic fact. For anyone interetsed in the foundations and history of American Education I suggest John Gatto's Book The Underground History of American Education. Knowledge Protects
5,One of the best books i've read!,"donald miller is such a wonderful, honest, ""wears his soul on his sleeve"" writer. this book gave me a fresh, new perspective on Christianity. it is a great book for a person who is a Christian or someone who has questions about Christianity."
5,Calling for change!!,"This book was amazing. I loved Donald Miller's writing style and how he took me through non-fiction, while still keeping me interested. BLJ brings up so many points that I don't feel many authors are courageous enough to say. Miller is humble, and aims to teach through his experience. It's astounding how you can go through life being a ""Christian,"" yet not lead a Christ-centered life, but now I can see how common this really is. The word Christianity in the eyes of a Christ-follower is a very different word than it is to someone who does not believe. It is hard, but we need to take responsibility and try to give Christians a better reputaion, and benefit ourselves as well!! Miller is calling for us to be genuine and loving! Please read this, you won't regret it!"
5,"Amazing Book, Easy Read","Donald has an excellent writing style that keeps you wondering and intersted at the same time. I read the book pretty quick and enjoyed every bit of it. He brings up thoughts and questions that you sometimes thought that you only thought. It is not a heavy religious book at all, just at the title states 'nonreligious thoughts on Christian spirituality. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good read."
5,I really enjoyed it,"I really enjoyed this book because Donald Miller sounds like a Christian guy who wonders a lot of the same stuff I do, but happens to be a writer. I liked the fact that Miller seems to be on the road with me in the journey to faith instead of telling me what to do. Plus it has some funny bits in it - which again, makes me happy there are people like me actually trying to figure out an authentic life lived for Christ looks like."
2,Had some Good points,"I was told by a lot my friend's that ""Blue like Jazz"" was a must read... Now that I have read the book, I am not to impressed. Don seems to ramble through the whole book. Granted, he did make some valid points but overall I would not recommend this book for others to read. Come on Don the problem with Christianity is not just the ""right wing"", Republican, and church going people. Granted they have tarnished the imagine, but you should just judge these groups. We need to love all, Republican's or homosexual. That is what Jesus would do...."
3,Not an Anne Lamott with testosterone,"This book is ok and might be a fine tool to give to a nonbeliver as an outreach tool, but as a Christian it did not bring me much insight into anothers spiritual journey. The back cover and the reviews are more a tool to help sell the book, then an actual review. So if you are expecting an Anne Lamott type book you WILL be very dissapointed."
2,Made me blue...,"I was disappointed in this book. I expected a book about a man's search for and conclusion to finding God. However, the God that Donald Miller found is a bit short of the God of Scripture. Too often his solutions to his search were to better the world. If God is who he says He is, then when you find him you have no way to do anything but just worship Him and continue to worship Him. The state of the earth is so minor to the state of those that don't believe Him.I wish Donald spent more time thinking of Man's state before God."
1,"Only for the mature Christan, if you want to read it","There is a lot of contradictions between what the author says and the Bible says. plus there are a lot of ""new age"" themes, not to mention ""emergent church"" doctrine. If you feel compelled to read it, just make sure you're really well-grounded in the Bible, and question everything that is written, and you should be OK. But, of course, reading the real truth of the Bible is far better. God bless."
4,gripping and touching,"Don Miller's way with words leaves you at times breathless and at times frustrated. His narration is stunning, his dialogue contrived. But what he accomplishes is something few Christian writers are able to attain--he touches your heart with sensitivity and insight, not just with narrow, moralistic invectives. For that reason alone, this book is worth reading.Miller has learned the craft of writing well, and it shows. If you can get past his overly critical caricature of church life, you'll leave with new insights into yourself and your relationship with the divine."
5,amazing!!!,This is the best and most original book i have read on Christianity in years. I am buying copies for my friends.
2,Skip this one,"Miller is too busy trying to convince Christian readers that liberals and hippies are good people and conservative Christians and their churches are bad that he neglects to make a strong argument about Christian spirituality, which is what the book is supposed to be about. Blue Like Jazz lacks both organization and depth in its content. I'd say pass on this one."
2,Bad Theology,"Blue Like Jazz is what happens when a person suffering from ADHD and bad theology has a need to sell books to make a living. We have been set free from relying on our feelings to guide our faith! It doesn't matter what our fleeting feelings tell us, we have an unchanging and graceful God who will never leave us!"
5,Loved it!,"As a Southern Baptist, conservative, and literalist I loved this book. On the surface Donald Miller and I probably don't share a lot in common, but the one thing we do have in common is Christ. He stripped away the non-essentials (such as denominational differences and some other limiting attitudes) and his words/actions convicted me of the essentials of truly living a faith-based life that can make a difference. It is a very enjoyable read with a lot of practical reminders of how Christians should function in the world. Thanks Don for getting my attention and teaching me through your growing and learning process."
2,"confusing, dated, and qustionable","I'd been interested in silat (and other martial styles) for some time, so I finally ordered this dvd. First off, it seemed to be cheaply burned from an old vhs tape onto a disk. Second, there seems to be confusion as to what is on volume 1&2 (breaking and history were to be on 1 but were on 2, etc). When it comes to the juru short hand forms... it gets weird. The practitioner does a couple punches while slapping his arms... then the combat application shows a grab and sweep (huh?). You can pull some useful techniques and ideas from it if you are willing to dig (or are running out of new moves in traditional systems), but as a martial art tape, it looks sloppy, tense, and confused."
3,"Good Lyrics, no beats","I have had this CD for a couple months now. I don't see what everyone is getting so excited about. This CD lacks any good beats. Even Holla and Kill Em All all that great. Ja has some good lyrics, but so do many others in the industry right now. He just doesn't have to beats to back them up. Hopefully Ja Murder, Inc will help ja out. Definate potential."
3,Its aight but not that great,"This kid can rap, but the CD lacks some tight beet's. Great rappin, poor beats. Thats about it."
5,Ja Rule cd is bangin. Every track on the album is the s**t.,"Ja Rule is the mother*****n shit. Every on the album is tight. This a album that I don't skip,because every track on the album is beatin."
5,best Helix,"This and ""No Rest"" were as great as Helix got. Great vocals, and you actually notice a great drummer...the crash cymbal, wow! Title track, ""Bringin' to the Party"", ""High Voltage"", are all true party anthems about being young, having fun, taking chances. Problem is Helix stopped taking chances after this, and began sounding like everybody else with garbage like ""Another Taste""; then one guy died, another retired, the rest quit and Helix crashed and burned out. Pitty they could not keep going. Would like to see this reissued with some unreleased demo's or live tracks."
4,"Bah, good looking on my ak","Bought this so I could use it as a bayonet on my airsoft gun, it served its pour se, but the design is pretty flaw-ful,Eg. The blade is croked, the spring will make sounds if you press on the blade, the blade looses colorUltimately , it's good for the price"
4,Can still poke your eye out but safer than a real one,The retract-ability of this prop was good. It is a sturdy piece so you can play stab things all day as long as they aren't eyeballs.
3,Didn't like it - But others might,"I used to use the purple CoverGirl tube of mascara, Washable Waterproof. Unfortunately, this flakes so I was on the hunt for another one. I don't like this mascara. I like to do touchups if I'm going from work to going out and you can't do that with this mascara. It's also kind of hard to wash off because it comes off in ""tubes"" and I have an insane amount of eyelashes. However, if you do like KissMe mascara - then this is for you. It's basically a replica at less than half the cost!"
5,A must...for anyone,This is the most touching movie I've seen since I was 8 watching the Iron Giant. It shows very well was most LGBT youth go through at some point in their life and the awful recoil it can have on their life and the lives of those around them
4,a humanist bemoans the death of humanism,"Sabato is a romantic and idealist living in an era when the triumph of capital and technology has rendered humans into little more than slaves of the machines they have created. He correctly points out the huge disparities of wealth in the world, caused by the single minded pursuit of money and markets to the detriment of social harmony and balance. The book is not a chronological account and jumps from subject to subject which can sometimes be frustrating to follow. But its brief account is not tedious and it brims with hope for humanity. His well-reasoned pleas will in the end fall on the deaf ears of the automatons who daily toil in their jobs, never questioning their predicament, or imagining that there is a more meaningful life, silently marching towards oblivion."
3,Fascinating content that could have been better presented.,"The stories of ten women who were air-dropped behind enemy lines in WWII to work as secret agents for the British Special Operations Executive, this book seems at first glance to be full of tasty tales of bold women and their daring exploits. Unfortunately, while the author may be an acclaimed historian, he's not a terribly good writer. The juicy nuggets excerpted from case files are encased in layers of clunky prose, making the reading less exciting and more just plain hard work. A better writer could have woven the facts into gripping narrative threads; I hope that better writer will come along and do this amazing material justice."
4,"Dantesque, a new circle of hell - 3.5 stars","A quick read, not a great novel, but charmingly written -- the parts on happiness are worth reading. The rich people are caricatures, but as a story it's not unconvincing in this day of people risking danger and humiliation just to get on TV. It is difficult to end such a story, and I didn't find the ending believable, but it didn't ruin the book."
1,CD player,I ordered CD player for personal use so I saw this player but when I got it only one side of the sound works I had to get my own head phones so when I hooked them up together I only got sound from one speaker
1,This product stinks,I have tried it and the fist time I traveled in the car and hita bump it skipped.
4,A classic soul group with a classic soul sound,"If you're a lover of classic soul as I am, you'll love this cd."
3,meh,It'll keep my guitar safe but I'm sure it'll wear out quick. Especially the thin layer of fake leather on the ends
4,Very Good Value,"This is a very good cd player. I mainly use it in my car, but it has never skipped or given me any problems. The main reason why I like this product is because it reads cd-r discs perfectly. I have had a lot of problems with even big expensive stereos reading my TDK burned cd's. But this player gives you great sound for both regular and cd-r discs. It is a steal at this price (especially when you don't have to buy a car stereo and get pressured to buy a $300+ system). I would much rather replace this product 5 times because the sound quality is just as good as an internal system in your car."
1,it BITES,"I decided to try this cd player cuz it wuz hecka cheap, it was supposed to be pretty good, WRONG. go with the panasonic sl-s360 a lot better than this piece of trash, go with the name brand, there's a reason those things are popular"
4,PIG AWAY WITH MURDER,The story was pretty good. I like murder storties.I the only thing that was not good was when Alex got away.Martyn was pretty brave when he went up to deans faceand the way he like Alex. I will give this story 4 stars
1,A PARENTS REVIEW - ZERO STARS,"My son got this book for free at a school function. I wish he had picked another! This book is disgusting. A kid kills his father (by accident, sort of) and then lies and lies to cover it up. The body sits rotting in the apartment for days before the kid and his neighbor dump it. They put makeup on the corpse to make it seem alive for the aunt. They try to frame another kid for the murder. The friend takes advantage in the end, and betrays him. Besides the obviously disgusting story line, this book is full of examples of dishonesty. The worst part is he gets away with it all. Is this a good example for our children? I think not! NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,*The Mystery of Martyn Pig*,"I thought the story ""Martyn Pig,"" was good. Although i didn't like the beginning and the end of the story it was still decent. Towards the middle of the book I started to get really interested in the story. I like the way the story made me wonder and the suspense got my attention a lot. Towards the end of the story the investigating and the police questioning, really interested me. For a minute,I thought Martyn pig was going to give in. By giving in I mean, tell the truth of the murder of his father. The story was really thrilling and mysterious in many ways. I also think the story could have had a better ending. But after all, the book was ok."
3,THE EXPERIANCE,"The experience of reading the book Martyn Pig was a good one. The book was really good, it had a lot of trilling adventures. Martyn and Alex did a lot of crazy but smart things. They did things you would'nt think a young pre-teen would think of doing. the writer of Martyn Pig made the story exciting through out the whole story. there was never a part, in my opinion, that was boring. so, in conclusion , I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to read adventure books."
3,martyn pig by jessica,the book martyn pig was a good book. I liked the book because it was very interesting. my favorite part of the book ias when Martyn and alex got rid of the body. I also liked when martyn had to hide his dad when he died because his auntwas going to come over. Alex and Martyn had to hide his dad and Martyn came up with a plan. He told his aunt that martyn'sdad was sick. i think that the ending could be better.
2,"Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy (2-Disc Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)","Got this movie on a recommendation. Acting is wonderful, but the casting of the characters is a bit of a give away of the plot. I had never read the book and had heard great reviews of this movie. Immediately guessed who the baddy was because the character cast was just out of place. Acting was superb, but here is the downside.... the story line is DRAGS along. Kinda like being in the dental chair waiting for the drill.... you know its coming, but it just seems to take forever to happen, and when it does.... its just painful."
2,"I was so excited to see this movie, but it turned out to be really boring.","Honestly I do enjoy spy movies and dramas. I couldn't wait to see this movie, but in the end it was so boring that I could hardly watch until the ending."
1,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sp...zzzzzzzzz","I love this cast! Love Gary Oldman and John Hurt, and most especially love Colin Firth. That said, wow, what a dense plot, what straight-faced line delivery, and such confusing cuts back and forth to the past, back to the present. At least I THINK that is what was happening. Don't ask me, though, because I fell sound asleep after about a half hour of wondering if Gary Oldman's character was going to remain silent through the entire film or eventually speak. My husband also fell asleep.Recommendation: For fans of serious, British, ponderous, impenetrable drama."
1,confusing,Too confusing. jumping back and forth in time; characters all looked alike... and Who shot Who in the end? and why? Too confusing in my opinion...
2,Very Slow Movie,"The acting was good, but I found the story quite slow, and didn't quite keep my attention the whole time."
2,tinker tailor soldier bored,I was really disappointed in this story..it was slow and hard to follow..it is a remake of an old movie.I would like to see the original and see if that is better
3,"Slow, quiet, and complex.",The movie was very slow and complex. The dialogue was often quiet (so much secret whispering). I think the movie went over my head. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to it.
1,Are intelligent and elegant code words for boring as can be?,"I wanted to like this movie. Had not read the book but enjoy these types of stories. I just could not make it past the first 45 minutes. The movie moved at the speed of slow, and seemed to relish keeping the audience confused for a long, long time. I did not find this amusing. I don't need light fluff that puts the storyline right in my face, but I cannot tolerate this pretentious garbage. Ok, director, you know the story line and I don't and you want to remind me of that for at least half the movie. Go away. I don't have time for this, nor do I want to try that hard - I watch movies for entertainment."
1,BORING!,Totally boring! The biggest waste of time I have experienced in a long time! It was kind of like watching wet paint dry.
1,Maybe reading the book first would have helped.,"Rarely do I watch a movie and find after the first 30 minutes that I haven't a clue to what's going on. My wife and I were both watching this. At the 30 minute point I asked her if she was as lost as I was. I was relieved to find I wasn't alone.After reading the wide variety of reviews, good and bad, it's clear that some people did like this movie. To me, the trailer was a little misleading because it made more sense than what I saw during the first 30 minutes of the film.If you feel you must watch this movie, you should probably read the book first and then try the movie. I am sorry I rented this one."
1,1st Kindle Hiccup,"I bought the new Kindle Fire a couple months ago. Overall i love the device, especially for books. The movie downloads are slow and sometimes don't ultimately download--frustrating when you get on a plane! I ended up ""downloading"" and PAYING for this movie several times, and was never able to get customer service on the phone to credit."
2,tinker tail... whatever,"I marveled at the ever-so-long 5-star analyses/critique/comparisons of this current version to 6 hours of Guinness. Not much of this is easy on the eyes or the brain. Oldman's robot-like performance, the garbled mumble of most of the British, Hungarian, Russian, etc articulation, plus the dreary venues/cinematography brought this equation to mind- slooow + confusing = boring. A huge yawn for me and for anyone wanting this thing to get off the ground, I wanted to be entertained, not burdened by a bunch of unremarkable talking heads being 'intellectual spies'. But then you have to be a major Le Carré fan to find this even interesting, much less entertaining. I returned the rental after 45 min. into the film."
2,disappointing,"While I cannot fault the actors, I do fault the director, director of photography, and art director. The film was basically in black and black with occasional shades of ochre and tan to indicate that a light had been turned on. Murky scenes - dialogue obscured by irritating soundtrack - massive leaps of faith hoping the viewer can follow what is already a subtle plot line (i.e., in the book). In short, a failed attempt to transform a well-written, complicated book into a two hour film. Stick with the mini-series."
1,Worst movie ever,"I can't believe I had to watch this movie, but I'd paid so I stayed for the whole movie, we hated it and everyone around us said it was worst movie they'd ever seen. Don't waste your time or money on this movie"
1,Another insomnia cure!,I just couldn't stay awake watching this horrible flick.had to watch it in 6 segments.this just another wombat!this is one forgettable movie.
3,lacks the human warmth and charm of the BBC version,"On its own this version might do relatively well, but it seems a mere shadow of the BBC version starring Alec Guinness. I found the tone very different. There is desperation in the first, certainly, but it is offset by British humor, and more importantly, a warmth that comes through the stiff upper lip. To me, the first ultimately was a film about the value of human relationships, while this felt nihilistic by comparison.In its own right it is a tight, intelligent movie. Nonetheless I thought they botched Connie, and somehow the characters felt unbalanced -- Collin Firth as Bill Haydon stands too far apart from other members of the Circus. Gary Oldman is technically superb but feels a bit mechanical.So if you have have the time, see the 1979 version as well."
1,Worst movie ever!,"We almost walked out of the theater, the sound quality was so bad and following the plot was even worse. Ridiculous moviemaking!"
2,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,Movie was slow and inclined to lose your interest too early.I would have liked to have seen the director improve the suspense quicker.
2,"Slow paced, difficult to follow","I'm a reasonably smart guy, I like mysteries and spy dramas, but this was just difficult to follow and stay into. It seemed to drag on interminably without any sense of rising or falling action or interest."
2,Tedious in the extreme,"I'll tell you why I say it's tedious. There is no attention to characterisation whatsoever. We are given no clues as to the motivations of the characters. They just go about doing mysterious 'stuff'. Colin Firth gets in a whole sentance explaining why he went over to the russians. It's just a pity the sentance is banal.Because the characterisation is missing, the movie is an endless parade of events happening to people we know nothing about and care about less. The plot is built up slowly and it requires intelligence to watch and decypher; that doesn't make it an intelligent film - just one in which the plot has been finely chopped. I'd rather join the dots in a children's play book.I gave it one star for the faithful recreation of the 70s, another for the photography."
1,Very poorly done. Unworthy of Oldman,"I have seen many of Gary Oldman's films and the man really intrigues me. He is probably the best character actor of our day and yet he does not seem to get the better films. Regarding this film, the story was a bit confusing - too much going back and forth in time. If I could say anything to ALL actors and actresses of today it would be ""Take diction lessons!"" Everyone speaks in whispers with marbles in their mouths. This is the reason I love older movies - movies of the 30's, 40's and 50's....one can understand everything EVERYBODY says. I had to turn on the captioning to understand what was being said in this film. Jeez!! I will continue to watch Oldman's perfomances but this was not one of his best. In fact, no one was worth watching in this film."
1,Slower than Slow,"If you like to watch people walk slower than snails, pause and do nothing at all for 30 seconds at a time, this is the movie for you. If you like confusing plot lines that move back and forth in different time zones without letting you know you've moved back ten years in time, or forward again, then this is the movie for you. If you like to watch people sitting in a car, for no known reason, endlessly swatting a fly...with no apparent relation to the story other than an artsy symbolic message for the directors and movie critics to ooh and ahh, then this is for you.About 3/4 of the way I finally gave up trying to figure out where they were goimg...I didn't care who the mole inside the spy service was. Naturally, predictably, the mole turned out to be the guy you recognize who hardly says a word the whole movie. What a shocking surprise.Do yourself a favor and rent something else....anything else"
1,WTF - I can't believe how bad this movie is!,"Catchy title, bad, bad movie. I guess I should read the book to make any sense out of it. Couldn't understand half the mumbled, mangled British dialog. I really like Gary Oldman but he acts like he just showed up to collect his check. Yeah, I know, he is in character and is brilliant... hogwash. Save your $$$, this is the worst movie I have seen in ages and I've seen some bad ones."
3,The use of Guerrilla warfare in the Pacific against Japan,"On Guerrilla Warfareis a 1937 Chinese text onhow to fight the Japanese and win. The British called these tactics:'commando'; hit hard and unexpectedly and run.The movie is like Billy Mitchell's B25 bomber raid from an aircraft carrieris about America innovating in the face of defeat.No one in this movie mentions that the Chinese they were basingthis methods on were Communists. In fact at that time the Sovietsand Chinese Communists were Allies against the Germans, Italians andJapanese. Other than that this movie is a lot like a John Wayneblood and guts war movie."
3,Not Your Best Work,"I recently saw this video, It's the Pied Piper Charlie Brown, and I have to say that I've seen better from Charles Schultz. Charlie Brown is reading the Pied Piper to Sally, but since it deals with rats Sally is having Charlie tell it with Sports Mice and Snoopy as the Pied Piper. At the end,Sally doesn't believe that it could really happen, so Snoopy is outside on his dog house inchanting Linus, Lucy, Peppermint Patty, and Franklin. They are dancing around his dog house."
1,Not the same as the classic peanuts,This movie was poorly written. The adults in the original movies were never seen and had honky voices. The peanuts were hardly in this movie and the animation is not even close to the originals.I would not have bought it if I had seen the copy write date (2000). I only saw the title and peanut classic. I would not recommned any except maybe collectors.
5,Great Lens,"As an amateur photographer, this lens was a stretch to justify. However, the picture quality is absolutely amazing and worth every penny - this lens will not disappoint. The VR is also a significant feature and allows the photographer (or student) to get away with the near impossible in low light, high zoom conditions. I am using this lens on a D80 Nikon and all functions work flawlessly."
5,A good lens hampered by non-user reviews,"Is the new version of this lens better? Yes.Is the old version bad on FX? NO!Most of the people who whine about this lens don't own it and haven't shot with it. I own this lens, and I love it. Looks great on DX and full frame film. Great on the D3.When can you tell a big difference between this lens and the newer version? Wide open in the corners on a D3x.How many of you shoot a D3x? Exactly. Unless you own or plan to own a D3x, this lens is for you. It has great optical quality and the difference in price between this and the new version can buy you a body or several other more useful lenses. Heck, you could even get a TC extender for the difference in price.This lens is a weatherproof workhorse. That fact isn't changed by a new lens or whiny babies who don't own it."
4,"Love, love, love Tamora Pierce","She can do no wrong and her young adult fiction is always a pleasure to read. This is a sequel to the Circle of Magic and Circle Opens series and brings our young heroes Sandy, Daja, Briar, and Tris back together for a captivating tale of power, corruption, kidnapping and general magical adventure.Better than Harry Potter!"
2,Definately Not Impressed,"One word: Ugh! I'm usually a GIGANTIC Tammy Pierce fan, this book was just sooooooo horrible! The plot disappeared under a mound of completely irrelevant romance. She made one of my favorite characters lesbian! And Sandry, Briar, Tris, and Daja seemed to be fighting ALL THE TIME!!!! It was so completely unlike how they reacted to each other through the other eight books that it made me want to scream! I definately don't recommend this book, especially for anyone under thirteen."
1,I love Tamora Pierce,"I am rating this book very low as I normally love her books. This book however was full of so many non climaxes I am not sure where to start. As reading I kept thinking this is it, this is the base line of the story; the driving force that will make the 4 reconcile to each. Instead I got a whole lot of pages of temper tantrums, misplaced trysts and political maneuvering ... For example the 4 have the same fights over and over, the intimacy between the characters and there love interests usually blends well into the story, in this book it was like she was trying make a statement, which she repeat over and over. And My god how many times can the same boring thing happen in this book?? I say all this in respect to the author, her books tricksters choice and queen as well as the terrier book where FABULOUS. I read everything she does and was sorely disappointed this time..."
4,Better,"This book is much better than Pierce's other books, and has a realistic touch to it, instead of being and ideal tale. With a better plot line and more subconflicts, it has a refreshing suspense and don't-want-to-put-it-down kind of effect. A drastic change from her earlier books, this one is by far her best written book. Unfortunately, since it is the continuation of a series, you might want to read the other books preceding it (8 books, 2 quartets)."
3,train wreck,"reading/watching the relationship between the four is like watching a train wreck! they were in complete discord, even when they seem to be having FUN in the arguments with each other there was like an underlying sense of, i don't know, anger? disaster? if anyone thinks in musical terms, it's like badly clashing notes with nothing to smooth it over. They were each in their on little pool of self pity and 'my experience was worse than yours' i just wanted to smack them all in the face. Not to mention sandry kept bringing up the fact that they left her and so on and so forth my eyes just blacked out. i prefered the circle of magic and the circle opens more than this one...but that is probably because i liked tammy's tortallian universe much better, so i approach the circle with slight disinterest."
2,A disappointment,"I've read all of Girzone's books and this one ranks definitely at the bottom of the list. Although he did stimulate some heavy pondering on my part about the role of the bible, other than the tearjerking opening scene with the little boy this book left me flat. Since he's a retired priest I've come to expect some level of Catholic theology but in my humble albeit Protestant opinion this book went over the line. I was glad when this book was over, a first for this Girzone fan."
5,Great Product!,"I have the beginnings of a 'swan neck' bend in my index finger. I usually wear a sterling silver finger splint, which is beautiful, but expensive. Because I have lost a couple of silver splints, I now keep a few of these inexpensive plastic Oval-8 splints on-hand to wear when I am at a higher risk of losing a splint: yardwork, camping, travel, grocery shopping, etc. If I lose one of these, I'm not out of pocket by much. The plastic splint is very comfortable, quite durable, and it works well to prevent the curves of my finger from growing more pronounced. My silver splints were sized by a physical therapist, and fit perfectly below and above the first knuckle. The fit on these plastic splints is not as perfect, but fit surprising well for 1/10 the cost. I highly recommend this product. It is comfortable enough to wear 24-hours every day without impeding normal activity."
5,A staple work on the Ardennes,"Students of the Ardennes Offensive will be familiar with a few standard works: Cole, Dupuy, Whiting, MacDonald, etc. Although appearing in bibliographies less frequently than some of the more recently accessible works, Toland must be considered a ""must-read"" for any serious student of the campaign.Toland's style is at once informative, descriptive, and compelling. But for the extensive details and the fact that the reader knows this is history, the work could be a gripping novel. And, as one reads more and more works, some of the words begin to sound familiar. Do what I did and check the bibliographies: you may find familiar passages are actually taken from Toland.Read this book."
3,Nope,"This book was very well edited and reads quickly. Unforunately, while I wouldn't call it biased, it is clearly an AMERICAN book and carries quite the patriotic slant... In other words, it is quite obvious the author's patriotism has leaked onto the pages.The initial German victories were presented more factually while the American counter-attack was analyzed far more depth with an annoying amount of praise for the latter. The American army is also clearly the focus of this book, so do not expect a balanced account. I for one, am reading my next book by a Brit."
2,A Disappoinment,"I purchased this case made for Musician's Friend in China. I'm sorry I did. This case sells for less than half the price of a real Gibson, Gator or SBK case. There's a reason for this. It is extremely cheaply made. The frame of the case is very thin and will crack under pressure. Also, rather than stitching the vinyl covering onto the case, it is glued. If you visit MF's website and read the reviews, you will find others who have recieved defective case, like myself, where the vinyl has pulled away and is coming off of the case - even at time of delivery. Mine appeared the same way, with the glue peeled off of the case and the vinyl covering coming away. It's not an easy repair and the case needs to be returned. It's not something you can fix yourself, it's obviously a defect with the cases Musician's Friend is having manufactured for them abroad. I highly recommend spending more money on a better case. This one is, well, basically, junk. Quite a disappoinment and waste of my time."
4,"Great product, but the wires are not long enough.","Yes, I needed longer wires, but they are impossible to find, and I'm working with such a small area, attaching extension wires wasn't an option."
4,Invaluable for the Novice,"After reading this book in preparation for an upcoming trial, I felt more confident and more in control for my role as an expert witness. I actually enjoyed testifying."
3,Through it all,"Like the title says through it all its an OK CD Player i got the one with the car kit and its pretty cool. The buttons are kind of hard to use,the lid doesn't pop open to its full extent and it just didn't fulfil my expetations. If you can look through all that (in which i did) its a sharp. I got it for ... so 4 that price with a ... dollar car kit and a ... (retail value not mine) dollar cd player it is ok"
1,Don't buy this book,"I have never read a book (until this one!) where the author said there was a better book on the same subject. Leys recommended reading ""Batavia's Graveyard"" by Mike Dash after reading his. Take his cue - buy that one not this one. There is no substance to this one at all. How it got published I'll never know."
3,"""Hurricane Eyes"" Is Their Best","I haven't heard everything from Loudness, but I've got a few albums from them including this. This was their apex musically. ""SDI"" is a classic heavy one from them. Minoru is a unique singer. His accent always added something original to his voice. That's a plus-not a minus. ""So Lonely"" is a classic ballad that is well performed. ""In My Dreams"" is another keeper. Akira Takasaki is a talented guitarist also. Great album."
2,HURRICANE EYES FALLS SHORT,"OKAY, IF YOU LIKED THUNDER AND LIGHTNING YOU WILL THINK THIS OFFERING(SANS S.D.I) IS NOT UP TO STANDARDS. THE SOLO'S ARE FLAT AND THE SONGS ARE JUST NOT AS CATCHY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED. IF YOU ARE A COLLECTOR ITS A GOOD ADDITION TO THE ARSENAL.MY SUGGESTION: DONT MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST PURCHASE . INSTEAD, GO FOR THUNDER IN THE EAST OR DISILLUSION. IF YOU LIKE HEAVIER METAL CHECK OUT THEIR LATER OFFERINGS, GHETTO MACHINE, OR ENGINE BOTH VERY COOL AND STYLISTICALLY DIFFERENT."
4,very good album..,"Had this one on tape when it came out..great music! the tracks ""this lonely heart"" and ""rock n' roll gypsy"" are some of the best songs from the 80's I thought, but like always a great band fell in the cracks of the hair bands..."
2,Not worth it.,"This bass tube will not hold up to 500 watts, it can barely hold up to 300 watts...and the bass is miniscule at best."
2,Alchemy's newest production,"This is the second feature from Alchemy, the urban division of Full Moon Pictures. It is refreshing to see a minority film in which the characters are not stereo-typed with street language and poverty jokes. Instead you get a refreshing script that could have been written for any actors. Darrow Igus turns in a strong performance as the doctor hoping to conquer society thru his army of zombies. Unfortunately, the film is only 72 minutes, much of it padded with musical performances (all geared toward selling the sound track) Because of this there is little room for character development and motives. The zombies are not flesh eating gory zombies. They are mind controlled victims of musical lyrics. There is enough horror to make this enjoyable and I hope this offshoot of Full Moon continues to produce further pictures."
2,Hardly the cream of french house...,"Why? It's too ""synthetic""...what I mean is the samples and cuts just get annoying after a while. I stopped listening after track 2. That's a serious disappointment in my book. I have over 3000 house tracks and frankly this cd ranks well down at the bottom. Ernest St. Laurent is always killer and the Heat Wave track by Phoenix is good too...but then the cd goes downhill.....reviews are very tough to gage for most people reading them and I know others on here really liked this cd. I just don't feel the same way."
4,Better than expected!,"I grew up in the beast era of transformers and I always loved to get toys of beast transformers that I never saw in the show. As far as I know Transmetal Airazor didn't appear in Beast Wars, Beast Machines, Beast Wars II, or Beast Wars Neo. However, she really is a great toy. Like all transmetals she has a vehicle mode that turns her bird mode into a kind of pontoon sled thing that some planes have so they can land in water. I thought it was weird at first but I've grown attached to it. She also has this ""armored"" mode for her robot form that looked cool but proves to be kinda useless since she wouldn't be able to move her hands in this mode.All in all it's a must buy for any collector and a fine edition to any shelf."
3,"great for beginners, a little boring for the rest","I got this book when I first started making kid's clothes. It's great for that; easy instructions, projects come out as described, and I didn't need lots of buttons and other doodads for them. As I became more proficient I got bored, and starting improvising with the patterns and designs. This is a great beginner, basic book, but if you are experienced skip it and go for the Candi Jensen series."
3,Beginner Book,I bought this book because it said fresh and fun designs but they were very simple and not all that fun. Good designs if your starting out and want to start a nice project.
2,Not That Cute,"The patterns in here are easy, but I only liked a few of them. The rest are things that most people probably wouldn't want to dress their child up in. I would recommend that people check this one out of the library instead of buying it to make sure that they really want to make the patterns in it."
3,basic,"The sweaters here are pretty basic. Boatneck, dropped sleeves, boxy construction, oversized styling, not much variation between patterns. But I did make one using Lion Brand microfiber yarn and it is one of my son's favorites."
5,Exactly what I needed,"Got this product in exactly on time, swapped out the bad for the new and PC booted up without the bios warning of fan failure. New fan blades are larger and fan is 1/4"" thicker than the old one but fit perfectly. Easy to install on PC, took about 5min to swap fans.*always make sure that you are not working on a computer on carpet but rather a hard floor surface, and make sure to ground yourself to the case so you dont give a static charge to the PC before connecting cables to the motherboard including the fan connector."
4,Pretty Good Product,"Pretty nice boat. I bought this boat before I owned a Real one! I still like it and the kids have a lot of fun with it. I had servo issues when it was new, but Megatech replaced the broken parts in a very satisfactory manner. It is a great teaching tool for kids who want to learn how to sail (although there is no replacing the real thing)."
3,Still refer back to it,Was used a lot for a college class! I still refer back to it occasionally when I need to refresh my memory on a mathematical process.
2,"Extremely poor quality, beware","I purchased these speaker stands because they were the cheapest I could find. I have small satellite speakers that are extremely light, so I figured that this would be a decent solution. Out of the 4 stands that I bought, 2 will absolutely not work as far adjusting height (they just slide down to the lowest position), and one had screws that were stripped out on the base. I can make repairs and rig the stands to work (just to avoid the hassle and expense of returning), but I had to do it over again I would not buy these stands. I'll leave it at 2 stars because they were so cheap, and they do look nice, but remember that you usually get what you pay for, and in this case, maybe a bit less."
5,"Etheral, boundless, beautiful music","Folks, get your thesaurus out, this music makes you speechless and at peace. I love this CD. I play it adnauseum. It's pretty music, even hard nose classical music fans can truly appreciate it. I wouldn't classify it as New Age music (it's the section you'll find it in) it's just nice beautiful music, well composed, well played. Mia Jang's feelings, soul and sincerity flows out of her, into her fingers tips and trips into the melodies of her music, you can feel it, buy it, highly recommend it!"
2,Needs more,"Okay for starters let me just say that Christain movie do have a low budget, but that is no excuse. It was an awful movie, not faithful to the book at all (oh yeah Frank Peretti the author, was in the movie!)!!! There is no one part that was entirely faithful. It was such a good book I was expecting so much more from the movie. I mean they had about 5 seconds devoted to one of the coolest parts in the book, and they even screwed that up! Wrong characters and everything. Abel Frye did not hang himself there ten years before, he never even exsisted for crying out loud! Let's just say, if you're going to make a book into a movie do it well or don't do it at all."
2,The Book is WAY BETTER! I don't recommend this movie!!,I just read Hangman's Curse. The book is incredible. As soon as I finished the book I decided to head over and rent the movie. I pretty much regreted it. The movie is totally diffrent from the book and I mean totally! It is absolutely nothing like the book. I personally could not stand the way they change everything and took all the details out.
5,Great Product,"Rx Nutrition is a great product. I learned many new things about nutrition that I've never heard before. The DVD provides instruction on when to eat, how much to eat, and the proper combination of foods (carbs, protein, fat).The DVD also provides valuable information on how to properly fuel your body for exercise. Food for exercise is in addition to your normal food! The DVD gives recipes and advice for the types of food to consume before, during and after exercise.I highly recommend this product for anyone who struggles with weight and/or the athlete who want to optimize their athletic performance.Thanks Dr. Rick Kattouf for producing a great instructional video!"
4,Mein Kamph,I liked it. The only problem was you couldn't tell who was a diva and who was a guest. Three of the other concerts were better ballanced. (not the Aretha tribute)
4,If I Could Turn Back Time,I think it's one of the best songs in the album. I'd like you could deliver it to Spain so I could get it. THX.
3,What!??,I have these same stickers and they are wonderful. They look beautiful in my childs scrapbook...however I did not buy my stickers from amazon. I bought them at Michaels. BUY THEM THERE OR AT JOANNE FABRICS! They are only $2.99. Where the hell does amazon get the idea that they can charge the price they are charging? RIP OFF!
3,Awkward and old fashioned,I investigated this book because of an interview in the NY Times with someone I don't remember who mentioned this as a book that was an overlooked classic. I found it to be awkwardly written and not very compelling. I think I must have missed something that made anyone think it was a classic.
3,(...),"I didn't find the movie all that good, but it is a book. How in the heck could this be propaganda? Gay people do exist in all walks of life. Get out in the real world a little more."
1,not what I expected,"After all the hype over this movie, I was expecting something great. What a disappointment!!! I found myself fast-forwarding through parts because it was soooo boring. The story was mediocre, and the acting wasn't much better. Really, after the sex scene, I was so ready to be done with this movie. It came across as violent, and that left me queasy (and FYI, if it had been a man and woman in the exact same scene, it would have bothered me just as much).Save your money...not worth it."
3,It was OK,"Dont get me wrong, I liked the movie but I don't think it was a 5 star movie or worthy of an academy award nomination (although I dont think any ""Hollywood"" movie nowadays is worthy of an academy award). The cinematography was indeed well done. I read other reviews and I get the feeling that many give it 5 stars just because its a gay movie and they may not have seen other quality gay movies. While watching Brokebake Mountain, I did not get any emotion out of it like I did with other recent gay movies such as ""Latter Days"" or ""The Trip"". Nevertheless, I'm glad I finally saw Brokeback Mountain and will be adding it to my DVD collection."
5,Everyone should see!,"Excellent portrayal of what is ""Real life"". Well performed by all major actors, sympathetic to theme."
4,"I fell for it, too","Ok, gay cowboys. I'd heard all the jokes. Still, this one is as good as you've heard. Sure, it gets a little icky here and there. And Jake really does look a little gay. I could barely understand Heath Ledger's cowboy accent, filtered through Aussie. Yet, the story is compelling, and the female stars as the wives are very good, indeed. Watch it. You won't be sorry."
4,Very good!!!!!!!!,"I got my mom to watch this and even she was impressed, and she can be very critical, especially when it comes to movies.The basic plot:-Two men meet in the summer of 1963, when they are both employed to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. There, they become friends - and, later on, lovers, even though both insist that they are not ""queer"" (gay). When their jobs come to an end, they go their separate ways, but neither are totally happy until, four year later, they meet up. Over the next 20 years, they meet up (once or twice a year). I won't give away any more...........This movie has been referred to as a ""gay cowboy movie"", but, after watching it, I feel that it is SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT!! It is about love, it is about accepting who you are (including your sexuality), it is about being true to yourself because, if you aren't, you will always be miserable.Just watch it."
5,"If all movies are like these, then the book industry will need to retire!","Usually I am not much of a movie finatic. Particularly since most movies today don't have content, just glamours tricks on film.But I have read numerous feedback about Brokeback Mountain, so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and the movie is so good, I had to pick up a copy of the story book in which Brokeback Mountain is found.Mind you, though, that content is what many movie viewers don't know about. So if the only movie you watch is action, or flicks, then you probably aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate this film."
2,Boring,"Had to watch the video for a class. Aside from the homosexual undertones, I found this movie slow and boring."
1,"awful, awful, awful","Two married with children people leave their vows and families to pursue ""love."" Poorly written and acted, although nicely photographed - this is an abysmal film. Without the homosex aspect it would have barely registered a blip. Glad my viewing was someone's DVD left around, so I took a look to see what the fuss was. A clever marketing ploy to get their audience to pay anything to see their cause forwarded, but ignored by the rest of us. Give it a pass."
5,Excellent Grade A movie,"I have finally seen the movie on DVD, and it has been worth the wait. The movie is a cinematic masterpiece. I've seen Crash, and feel Brokeback Mountain should have won the oscar hands down. Previous reviews will give you a rundown on the story line, and masterful direction of Ang Lee. On a rating of 1 to 5 I'd give it a 6."
5,Superb DVD but wrong zoning,"DVD is perfect but due to its US Zoning, I could only read it on my PC in low definition, and not on my TV linked HD-DVD nor my std DVD. This was a huge disappointment for me. Since I did not find a version with Europe Zoning suitable for France elsewhere, I did not return but was very upset not having been alerted properly on that.I would have expected a clear zoning indication plus a warning in your ordering system when a customer from a country not in scope of DVD/HD-DVD zoning tries to order it.Regards."
2,dull film -- not worth the praise,"This is unmitigated camp -- poorly acted, saddled with a sappy New Age soundtrack, excruciatingly ""sensitive,"" and full of stereotypes.Healthy gay audiences -- the ones who aren't perpetually suffering but going out and living their lives unashamedly and without apology -- have already adopted it as a cult film, laughing hysterically and adding new dialogue to screenings in Greenwich Village, where it is already a cult classic on the level of ""Mommie Dearest"" and ""Showgirls.""The only good thing about it is the photography. Ansel Adams would have been proud."
1,mumbled lines and bad acting,"The only redeeming thing about this movie is the scenery. I am not giving this movie one star because of the sexual content. I am giving this movie one star because of the acting. Heath Ledger mumbled his lines do badly I could not understand a word he was saying, and I watched this move twice. A cardboard standup would have displayed more acting ability than Jake Gyllenhaal. My advice, don't bother."
5,It is incredible!!,"This cd totally touches my heart! It speaks to me in new ways everytime I listen. These artists are real and have been through the everyday struggles of all christians and it is very evident in the cd ""40 Acres."" I promise you won't regret it, you will be changed!><>"
5,Still their finest,"I have a large number of non-Christian friends of about my age (34), who tend to associate CCM with painfully sincere lyrics and an embarrassingly over-produced sound. Of all the albums I own that I use to ""break them in"" to the contemporary Christian sound, 40 Acres (along with either of Jennifer Knapp's recordings) is the most successful. This is a wonderful album, rich both in praise and in wisdom, and rich both in the angst of young adulthood (yes, Christians get ""angsty"" too!) and in trust in God. Yes, I tell my friends, Christians worry about finding the right person (and ""Table for Two"" is a marvelous meditation on that subject) and about differentiating themselves from family and friends and walking one's own walk with God (the marvelous ""Faith my Eyes"").The tunes are fabulous, the lyrics witty and candid, the spirit undeniably faithful and Christian. Though their new album is also excellent, this one will live longer in my cd collection."
5,One of the best ...,"...Christian music albums of 1999. I bought it based purely on the quality of the last album and think I actually like it better! So often I skip through tracks when listening for the first time, but didn't with this one. For some reason, it's so easy to listen to; the lyrics are introspective and ""real"". A little more country/folk than the last, but still maintaining a young, fresh, alternative sound."
4,they are an awesome and talented group!,"yes!!! This is an awesome cd!!! It isn't very hardcore alternative...if you know what I mean...but it is a little more mellow. The song ""thankful"" is great and ""shifting sand"" is great too. I would suggest this cd to anybody who liked the last cd. At first I didn't like it that much but it really grows on you."
5,2 year old likes it,Seems like a good lunchbox. My 2 year old loves it. Feels sturdy. Thats about all that matters. Its blue.
3,Thomas Lunchbox,"The box was a huge hit with my 4 year old and he LOVED the extra, ""hidden"" compartment for his treat on the front. Ours however got a crack in it within the first few weeks. It must have dropped just right on a corner. It's still usable, but we'll probably be switching before Christmas break."
2,"Cute, but not durable","My son got the Thomas the Tank Lunch Box Set at the start of kindergarten. By the second day, the front compartment had broken off. We are very disappointed with the quality of this product as my son is not a rough and tumble young man. :-("
1,This is a TOTAL piece of garbage!!!,"I wanted to organize my finances, and friends have recommended using quicken. I have a degree in finance and work at a software company, and this has to be the most confusing program I have ever used. Entries are constantly being placed into the wrong categories, payments to credit cards are showing up as INCOME and EXPENSES at the same time. Transfers between checking and savings keep showing up as income on reports (by quicken's estimate, I am making 4x my salary in income just because I move money between accounts.)I think I am going to dump this program and use Excel instead ... I spend aboout 3 hours every week just trying to get everying to balance, and this program is taking a lot longer than it would do do things by hand. I've been trying to get ths software up and running for over 3 months, and it just doesn't work, period. Quicken: What are you doing?!? This was supposed to make my life easier ..."
2,What a buggy piece of garbage.,"I have been using Quicken since ""Quicken 4"" on my Mac. It WAS a great program. This version is okay except for the investment portfolio. It is full of bugs, and is not at all intuitive (ironic, eh?). Further, you cannot simply ""fudge"" and enter your historical transactions ... so my cash balance is wrong, and impossible to correct. After researching online, it is clearly a bug that Inuit will not even acknowledge.Hopefully they will get their act together for 2005, otherwise, I'm out of there!!"
1,Major BUG,"I have been using new version for about a month, today got a sort of memory error that causes Quicken to shutdown. They don't have a fix. I am stuck. Tried reloading software, didn't fix problem. This has to do with Net Worth graphs looking at more than 12 months of data. Tried running performance reports and could never get any % always got N/A.DO NOT UPGRADE"
3,Works fine for me,"After seeing the other reviews, I was hesitant to buy. But the forced upgrade gave me no choice. I would have been happy to keep my Quicken Basic 1999. I use Quicken only for investment tracking. I had no installation problems, as others reported. It found and converted my old data. I was real happy that it asked if it wanted to uninstall Quicken 1999 for me, because I was afraid I would screw it up if I did it myself. Installation and conversion went flawless. It backs up to my CD-RW with fewer problems. Had to re-register to get on-line quotes. Don't like to give my address away. But on-line features work. Although a major investment firm I use does not participate in their downloads.Seen no bugs so far, but we'll see.Only giving 3 stars, due to forced upgrade. I assume they'll do that to us again someday."
1,Wish I could give this a Negative Star,I've used Quicket since 1998 and upgrade every two years. Bought this product almost two months ago (wish I'd read these reviews) and have had nothing but problems. It keeps crashing and so I went to the web site and did an product update. Stopped crashing but then all of my data was corrupted. (Said I had a net worth of $2.4 million) Did the online help and they told me to uninstall and reinstall & upload the updates and then go back to my original data from when I first converted to 2004. Did this and had to re-enter all information from about three weeks. Data continues to become corrupted with faulty reporting. I have spent countless hours reloading and updating and finally gave up. Found an old 2002 file from first of January and I'm in the process of installing 2002 back on and updating all transactions (stock dividends & investments can't be done automatically). Don't buy this product. A company as large as Intuit has to fix this. It's a disgrace.
1,Absolutely Amazingly Buggy,"I have NEVER seen a commercial release of software this buggy before in my 20 years as a computer user. Almost every button does nothing, it hangs all the time, the online functionality is a complete failure (never even runs when you click the button), the download of the original software takes hours and locks your computer up (the download of msft money takes 7 minutes in contrast). DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE. I fiddled with it for 2 hours, and then promptly demanded (and got) a refund."
2,"one step forward, two steps back","I was quite astonished when I upgraded to 2004 from 2002. I thought I was two releases behind, so it would be prudent to upgrade. While the user interface changes (I question if it was for the better: think fisher price toys), so much functionality is either now optional, forced, or not available in lieu of ""neat"" stuff which honestly is just dumbed down controls for a low-tech audience. For a list of this stuff, check out the other reviews as I have nothing new to add and several folks say it much better. In then end, I would question first why you think you need this upgrade? and if not an upgrade, but a first time purchase, save money and find an old version on ebay -- it's worth it."
1,When Good Software Goes BAD,"In my thirty-seven years of existence I have never been agitated enough about a product to write a complaint letter / review; however, Quicken 2004 is so horrible I just had to warn people. DON'T' BUT THIS PRODUCT.I have been a Quicken user for over 10 years, and I 'm just amazed at the poor quality of this release. The user interface is clunky and quite often flashes unnecessarily, on-line updates often fail, and one of my on-line accounts is de-activated because Quicken keeps sending the wrong password intermittently.And what genius decided to put the ""accept all transactions"" button so close to the ""accept a single transaction"" button. Twice now, I have accepted all transactions with invalid categories, because I mistook one button for the other.Buyer Beware!"
1,Disappointing is an overstatement,Do yourself a favor and save money by not buying this version of Quicken. Buy an older version instead if you are a loyal Quicken user. I have been upgrading my Quicken to newer versions every time there is a new release to Quicken since 1995. This is the first time that I truly can say I HATE IT. It put transactions into wrong accounts. I couldn't move the transactions to correct them. To say nothing of the awkward way to manually enter stock transactions. Heaven help you if you aren't doing an automatic download. After 2 months I had had enough and switched back to my older version of Quicken. I had to reload the transactions from those two months but it was worth it to avoid the continuing hassles. Granted my tax estimater is off but that is really the only drawback. And I won't even bother to address the spyware issues since everyone else reviewing that has gone on to great length about it. Buy this version at your own risk.
1,DO NOT BUY QUICKEN,Poor programming. Importing feature make errors repeatedly. Have to reinstall several times to get working with errors caused by quicken. Error messages blame financial institution but turns out to be quicken error. Overall I do not recommend quicken and wish I had read the rest of these comments before buying in the first place.
1,Thanks for the Feedback,"I was all set to purchase Quicken 2004. I received the letter from Intuit stating they were discontinuing support and quote downloads for Q2000. As always, I check Amazon's customer feedback for products before I buy them. I have always been loyal to Intuit and bought their products, but last year's TurboTax put me off, and this just put's me off further. Thanks everyone."
1,Give it back to Intuit!,"I have had nothing but unresolvable problems with the past couple revisions. The other reviewer is right, customer support stinks, Intuit is slow to repond or fix bugs and the product which we are all purchased to centralized our financial information, the very core of our existance, is at best ""dangerous"" to chance using it with your data. Count me as another one to flee to Microsoft Money."
1,INTUIT You Owe Us All A Refund!!!!!!!,"Another consumer who wasted $35 (at Sam's Club) on this horrendous software!Not only does it have all of the aforementioned problems, but its screens are a cluttered mess! What torques me is that I'm unable to rid the screen of things I don't want, need, or use.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!If you have 2000, stick with it. I'm hoping I can reload my 2000 version. 2004 will be donated to some unsuspecting soul via the local Salvation Army thrift shop."
1,Can't add - hate the GUI,"Like many of you I was forced out of Quicken 98 and into 2004. What a lot of useless junk on the screen and ""support"" tells me there's no way to trim down the display. Furthermore the system crashes and can't add during reconciles (!).But here's my question: is there another forum for discussion besides Amazon? A place where we can share usage secrets and compare Quicken with Money or Quickbooks?"
1,WHAT A RIPOFF - IT'S QUICKEN 2003 WITH A NEW BOX!!,I have been using Quicken for over 10 years and have never been more unhappy with an upgrade than this. I really cannot tell the difference other than the colors.INTUIT - GIVE ME MY $60 BACK!!!
3,Solid Audio Rack Stand.,"Realizing my DVD, satellite receiver, Tivo, 8-bit Nintendo and archaic VCR were stacking up and cluttering up my interior I purchased this in an attempt to put more order in my life (cables management is step 2 but that's another story). It is solid and heavy and takes a little effort to put together (though nothing as bad as IKEA) but the result is nice and the back has a decent way of putting the cables down the middle and the backs being able to be pulled off with Velcro for easier access. The black is nice but it's still not as modern as I would like it to be."
4,A Must Read for the Modern Age,"I teach an undergraduate class on psychology and the African American experience and have found this book to be a simple but powerful introduction to the reality of the enslavement of Africans. Although intended for a young adult audience, most college students are unaware and untaught this information and thus unprepared to take advantaged of the more critical information provided at that level. This book is an excellent primer.I'll also add that the audiobook is also done well. The voices bring additional weight to the experiences of those enslaved."
5,THESE GUYS WRITE FANTASTIC SONGS.,"I'll say this up front, I know these guys through my brother who does their website and was their soundman for a couple years. These guys will be HUGE someday. Cool guys who know how to write a great song. And they are GREAT musicians. Not like most bands that are popular and can't play for s***! It's unfortunate that things didn't work out with Dan their original Bass Player but I guess things are meant to happen for a reason. So keep your eyes and ears out for these guys. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Great way to monitor power usage,"I bought this to monitor the usage of my HTPC to see if the power supply I was purchasing for it would offer enough power without stressing it. This device functioned superbly. It is an easy one-look way to check the usage of a device. It also can give you an idea how much you might be spending to power something.If you purchase one, walk around your house and plug various things into it (including some of those things with a 'soft-off' state, like a TV). You'll realize how much money in power is literally wasted every minute.Excellent device."
2,Not user friendly,"This is not user friendly at all. The unit is designed so that you cannot have anything else plugged in as it leaves no room for the bottom half of a duplex outlet. Try to test your tv and you need an extension cord for the cable box or any other appliances you may have at an outlet. This was a poor design as all that had to be done was to reverse the locations of the plug and receptacle on the unit.The unit has no memory. When unplugged it loses everything. You have to crawl under desks, behind furniture etc etc to read the numbers. Not very convient at all. Definately would not recommend it."
3,covers other outlet,The product seems to be working fine but deserves a back eye for halfway covering the 2nd outlet. This is just silly. Maybe the slightly more expensive one doesn't do this?
5,Fun!,"What a fun product. When I first bought it I ran around plugging everything into it, seeing how many watts each device was drawing. Now that I've had it for a while I will admit that it's been gathering some dust, but it still gets used from time to time. After my most recent power bill at the apartment I think I'll dust it off and give everything a thorough test and see where I can make improvements. A neat gadget, and worth it when you're considering where to improve your energy consumption."
1,Useless,"... and I had such high hopes. According to this thing, none of my appliances use any power at all. I wish.Returning."
4,Operating instructions,"I like the idea of comparing electric usage on different items in my home but I am still trying to figure out what the number readings mean. I'm sure I can put this tool to good use, but there were no practical directions for use. What I got so far is a bunch of number readings but don't know how It has readings for volt, amp, watt, hz, kwh, va, pf, and hour. What in the world is pf (power factor), or, what is the ""hour"" reading, how much time has lapsed since your started the reading, the clock time,or what?. I'm sure I can put this tool to good use, but there were no practical directions for how to use and apply the readings.Ed, MO"
4,p3 info,A product that does what it states. Fast and easy to use. Opens up the details of how much energy a product consumes. Share it with your friends.
4,Wish it had a battery,"This is a great product that will help you find where you are wasting electricity in your home/office or anywhere you plug stuff in. The only complaint I have with this product is that when I plugged it in to my home entertainment system, I was unable to read the display without unplugging it becuase of the size of my entertainment system.. Ended up using logitech notebook webcam and flash light to see results.. Everywhere else in the house was much easier to get to."
5,Energy Meter,This is a very neat item. Looking to find your energy leaks?Plug your household products into this and see what kind of enery you are wasting. Some phone chargers actually use energy when left plugged in to the wall and not to the phone. Toasters can also be an energy drain when left plugged in.
2,"Nice product, Bad warranty","This seemed to be a good item, It performed well for few months of use. Then I pluged in a wet vac to check the amp draw and it went blank.I emailed the company about a replacement as it was only 9 months old. they stated the warranty is six months, I could ship it to then and pay $15 and recive a new unit. On the Amazon site it shows one year warranty."
5,Interesting Tool,"I've had my eye on one of these for a while and finally just got one.It does smell strongly of electronics. Doesn't really bother me. I ran it to a max of almost 200W on a computer, haven't had any issues with it so far. It does have a limit of 125V, 15A, 1875VA.As pictures and reviews show, you may want an extension cord or power strip, because it will cover more than one outlet.It measures: Voltage and frequency of outlet. Current, power (W), apparent power (VA), and power factor from the the draw of what is plugged in. Accumulates kWh, shows timer of how long it has been measuring this in minutes and hours.I found that my transformers don't really draw much when not on (<0.1W, display shows 0.0W). A monitor in standby or a suspended laptop can use a few watts, which will add up eventually.The more expensive 4460 or 4480 models have more features but did not seem worth it to me."
2,Not easy to use.,"I wanted this item to compare electrical usage between different appliances. I am not an electrical or mechanical genius, but I thought it would be easier to use than it is. First of all, since it has to be plugged into the wall outlet, it can be difficult to get in place, & then difficult to impossible to read. We made a ""pigtail"" to eliminate this problem, but I still don't always know what the results are telling me. No instructions to speak of doesn't help. It may work for contractors, but not for everyday people"
4,Useful Too - Idea for upgrade though,"Very good tool for assessing appliance energy utilization. You can see current usage real-time. For freezers which cycle on and off, you can measure consumption over a day or week or any length of time.I'd like to see either an illuminated readout or the ability to unplug and have the readings remain visable. It is tough to see usage when in a dark place."
5,Great Device,"If you ever need to find out which one of your electrical devices is a guzzeler, this will do it, and for not too much money. However you will need to add an extension, 3ft or 6ft is fine."
4,"Really a ""watt"" killer","Works as described. With battery back up would get 5 stars. You can plug in and individual component (fridge) or a system of appliances (stereo system) and it will tell you exactly how many killowats used in a given period, allowing you to calculate very accurately how much that unit will cost to run a year. Super idea. Suggest they add a feature that will do the ""year total average"" calculation for you. THAT would be 6 stars!"
3,KillaWatt monitor,"This itemm seems to work as designed. With nothing else to calbrate it, I can't tell how accurate it is. I ussed it to compare two refrigerators, and am satisfied with the results. The only daw back is that it does not store any information after being unplugged, so you generally have to have an extention cord to make it practical."
5,P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor,It works as described. I have used it to check power usage on different items in our home and now know how much power is being used by different components. Good to have!
2,Not convenient to use,"Because of its size and shape, there are very few places this device can be plugged in without displacing other plugs. Thus,to use it in my entertainment center (TV, DVD player etc.) is impossible. To use it for my refrigerator requires unplugging other appliances that share an outlet. The device should have a cord coming out the back. In fact, one could purchase a very short extension cord, connect it to the back of the unit and solve this problem. But why should you have to?"
1,"good, inexpensive meter",This inexpensive watt meter produces amble information about the type and amount of power we use. I have it hooked up to a cellar dehumidifier and hope the power costs will help us decide whether to get a more cost efficient machine. It is very easy to use and read.
4,Great product,"It was sent super fast to me! Works great, although I think it may be a bit inaccurate for very low wattages."
5,Fun experimenting,"My fridge was running ALL THE TIME. We were able to test it. The wattage was not as bad as I expected, but it wasn't really efficient, either. I was very happy to replace it. Be persistent in your tracking so you do a whole week (or some useful measurable amount) of normal usage of what ever it is you want to test. It accepts three prong appliances."
5,Great Product!,This is a great product. It has helped us determine which items in our house have been using so much electricity and costing us so much money. This product will pay for itself in savings and then will continue saving us money.
4,Usage monitor can save money,"Great device for under $30, except it cost me a lot of money to replace the two energy hogging 25yr old referigerators I had! One suggestion for improvement is a battery backed up memory. As soon as it is unplugged or circuit is interrupted for any reason the data is lost."
5,Everyone wants to borrow this,"This is very handy for finding out your energy waster throughout the house. It can aid in saving you massive dollars on your electric bill. It is accurate and tells you how many amps, volts, and watts are being eaten up. Get on!!! This is also a fair price-just don't tell your neighbors you have one or they will be using it instead of you."
4,P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Monitor,"This really does work, but the problem is that there is no easy way to put this in a plug if the plug is behind something. Obviously houses have things in them, so that is a little disappointing, but this does work well. I think that it helps in understanding which appliances and electronics are sucking out the most energy, but the problem is if you have a ton of surge protectors, then unplugging and plugging all your things is a hassle. I think there should be a surge protector Kill A Watt which and determine how much energy is being used by each socket."
3,Cool - but could be improved...,"I had to decide between buying this unit and buying the competition - the ""Watts-Up""Watts Up PRO- the pro model of the Watts Up does cost more - but it does more too. My biggest complaint with the ""Kill-A-Watt"" is that the unit covers both outlets in a dual receptical (even if you plug it in the ""top"" outlet as pictured) - so you will want to buy a short pigtail if you need to use this in a duplex or quad outlet. The ""Watts Up"" comes with a cord.Otherwise, it is a fun tool - my kids ran all over the house testing things to see how much power they consumed."
1,I RECOMMEND THE OTHER VERSION,"Make sure you get the other version of this product. This version (the 4400) does not project electricity costs!The ""EZ"" version, theP3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor, is more useful as it projects your electricity costs."
3,Try Using Your Hand Instead,"I played around with this product but to be honest it is quicker and easier just to use your hand instead. Put your hand on the energy consumer. If you burn your hand this item is a MAJOR energy consumer. 50 watts plus. If it feels warm is is a MINOR energy consumer. Say 15 watts. If you feel no warmth at all -- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT! Objects that consume a reasonable amount of energy at least feel warm. For example, a cell phone charger plugged into the wall with no cell phone attached. Put your hand on it. Does it feel warm? Yes? Then Unplug it! No? Then Don't Worry About It!"
1,not what you think,"DON'T BUY THIS...I read the review and thought this would save me work and some math, I was wrong. This product reads like it will calculate your power usage (hour, day, week, etc.) it doesn't they don't even give you the formulas to figure out the information the ""large LCD"" gives you. SAVE YOUR MONEY, the power usage numbers that come with the product will serve you just as well"
3,Kill a what?,"The Killawatt works OK for 110V appliances but does not work on 220V - i.e. electric dryer, water heater, stove, oven, or other 220v watt eaters. Perhaps another model other than the one I bought works on 220V. Check it out before you buy. Also, there is absolutely no explanation of the various electrical jargon that the device measures. Volts, watts and Kwh are pretty obvious, but the other measures are a mystery. Also no reference to average Kwh usage by typical appliances. This info is on every new energy star appliance, low to high usage, etc. and there should at least be a website link to find this info so one knows if the appliances that they are measuring are watt hogs or perhaps not worth the expense of replacing. Conclusion: not worth the price without 220 V capability and some basic information on what it all means."
5,P4400 Kill A Watt,"I wanted to put a Microsoft MCE computer on line in the living room, but I was afraid of the power usage, We live in Hawaii and pay some of the steepest prices for electricity. Using the P4400 Kill A Watt put my mind at ease. The LCD screen is very easy to read, I had no issues or problems with operating the device. Its nice knowing just how much electricity a device will use, and estimating how much it would cost to run, helps. I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone."
5,P4400 Kill A Watt electricity monitor,"I bought this unit to measure appliance power consumption to size a solar system. One simply plugs the appliance into the unit and the unit into a 120v power outlet. It will give instantaneous readouts of volts, amps, and watts; and more importantly it will give total watts used over a period of time.It won't save you a dime, it just tells you how much power an appliance uses. It was exactly what I needed at the time, I doubt that I will every use it again."
2,over priced,"Product over priced,the only buttom I uses is the watts per hour. For the average commsumer the other buttoms are useless."
4,"Works Well, but blocks outlets",This is an effective tool for monitoring power usage of applications. It's easy to use with a straightforward interface. My only real complaint with it is that it is hard to plug in without blocking other outlets.
4,Kill a Watt Monitor,"All I can say is that my husband has been having a ball checking out electricity with his new ""toy"". It was worth the money also in showing us where we could save energy."
2,Takes up both outlets,"This is a simple little product really, but it does what its supposed to do. And I would have given it 4 stars based on that...BUT...what idiot designed this thing? It takes up both outlets because of the way they placed the prongs. They are too far toward the middle of the device so it extends over the other outlet. What's with that?And it would have been really nice if they made the plug swivel so it could extend off either end and also work better with surge protectors, etc."
2,Too difficult to use - covers entire outlet station,"Probably would not have returned this if it did not cover both outlets when plugged in. Item is relatively difficult to use and requires some research before being able to determine electrical consumption rates for varying items. Digital output is easy enough to read. Would prefer an item that I can simply enter the cost per watt for my house and have the product display cost per hour, etc."
4,No Backlit LCD?,"I bought this great little gadget to quickly check which devices in my house were using the most power. I was successful, but this product seems to have been designed for long-term energy metering, not quick power checks.First, the LCD panel is not backlit, so if your outlet is in a dark corner, be prepared to get a flashlight and get on eye level to accurately read the display. Second, while it has many different modes for measuring power, I did not see a kilowatt-per-hour reading, which is why I bought it. You can still work out the kWh from the wattage output, but it's more trouble.These strike me as modest upgrades that would have made this device truly excellent. But for the price, this is still the best one out there."
2,CDI BOX For 1986 Honda TRX 200 SX,I purchesd a cdi box from RICKS MOTOR SPORTS for a honda 1986 TRX 200 SX. When i received the new cdi box it was for a TRX 400 not compatable for with my 1986 trx 200 sx. I left a note in the return package call me or e mail if the wright part available. Have not herd back from anyone i guess part not available.
4,Crock is an attractive beverage dispenser.,"Mine leaked! I replaced the Tomlinson spigot with another unknown brand that I found locally. While the spigots looked identical, the gaskets were different. The Tomlinson had two plastic gaskets and the replacement spigot came with one silicone gasket. The silicone gasket works perfectly.I expected the water from the crock to be cool, but it's no cooler than the water straight from the 5-gal water bottle.I also purchased a Dolphin Pump and it works great right on the 5-gal water bottle. The water from the water bottle is just as cool as the water from the crock. So, forget the crock for water storage and get the pump.However, if you want to serve iced tea, the crock would be very good. The ceramic interior doesn't stain or retain odors.I purchased a white lid for my crock from WaterCrockShop.com."
1,Life span of this TV is 4 years,I've had this TV for about 4 years and it's broke. I've researched online and other people have the same experience with this TV as me.. about 4 years of use and it breaks.. out of warranty.. so it'll cost a lot to try to fix it..I bet lot of those 5 star rating are people giving those reviews without using for more than few months..What a waste of money. WILL NEVER BUY OR RECOMMEND SHARP TV AGAIN!!!!
2,Staying At Home,"Dominique says that these songs are close to her heart and about HOME. Dominique dear, as the old saying goes.""You should have stayed at home. Let us hope that your teaching endeavors are much better."
4,Rock On!,"I went to a DKM show and Anti-Flag was opening for them. I was totally blown away! The passion and love these guys play with is incredible. I give massive repect to any band that can open with a d--- good cover of ""White Riot."" Thier CD represents everything good about the first amendment. But however good their CD is, their live show is 10,000 times better. Check 'em out!"
5,¡Son hijos de putas en la Rosario!,"Bersuit Vergarabat `va forzar todo en la concha de su...' por esto letra, y otros mensajes políticos contra el gobierno argentino esta canción era prohibido. Y tal vez por esta razón, cuando yo fui profesor en Gualeguaychu, mis alumnos me dan este CD. Les agradeció mucho.Diez años más tarde, aun estoy disfrutando Bersuit, compre otros discos deles, mas recuerdo Libertinaje. Pienso que es el mejor. Otras canciones excepcionales, `Se viene' `Vuelos', y `¿Qué paso?'"
4,GREAT FOR THE CAR,"I bought this CD player for my mother, who has never owned a CD in her life. She jogs and also has a tape player in her car so i bought the Jogger with the car hook-up. She has not stopped raving about it! She can't believe the improvement in the sound quality. So if you are looking for a good car hook-up and are worried that the sound won't be good, I will vouch that it is at the very least an improvement from a tape player. Her car is a 98 and in good condition so that may help the sound quality. I read a review saying that the sound quality was terrible, but I have to say that was probably an old car with a bad tape player. Also, you can't expect a portable CD player with a car hook-up to sound as good as a regular full sized CD player, especially for $70. For the quality and price i give it 4 stars."
3,Humble beginnings for this great band...,"If my memory serves me correct, this was the band's debut album, and except for the great track ""Electricity"", this album has little else to offer. Many of the tracks are very much in the experimental stage, and overall production was a bit weak. ""Dazzle Ships"" is another very experimental album of theirs, but there the band's experience and artistic flair really comes through well. Although I rate this as their poorest effort, the album is a must for the true OMD fan - even if only to hear the humble beginnings of this great band.If you do not own any OMD music, then perhaps the ""Best Of"" compilation is the place to start. If you already own that, then maybe move to ""The Pacific Age"" or ""Crush"" next, especially if you're a recent OMD fan. Hardcore fans should find this album interesting and worthwhile to own, but keep those expectations down."
3,Bent fairy tales,"If you like fairy tales that turn the genre traditions on their head, this is the book for you. Contains: ""Little Polly Riding Hood"" by Catherine Starr; ""The Gentle Knight"" by Richard Schickel; ""The Faithful Bull"" by Ernest Hemingway (yes, THAT Hemingway); ""The Signal"" by Jack Sendak; ""Princess Dahli"" by Tanith Lee; ""Molly Mullett"" by Patricia Coombs; ""Gudgekin the Thistle Girl"" by John Gardner; ""The Cat-King's Daughter"" by Lloyd Alexander; ""The White Seal Maid"" by Jane Yolen (a bittersweet tale of love and sacrifice); ""The Dark Princess"" by Richard Kennedy; ""Petronella"" by Jay Williams; ""The Wrestling Princess"" by Judy Corbalis (this, along with ""Petronella"", was my favorite. Both had strong female leads and great characterization); ""The Enchanter's Daughter"" by Antonia Barber; ""The Story of the Eldest Princess"" by A.S. Wyatt; and ""The Outspoken Princess"" by Dov Mir."
5,An Unearthed Jewel,Lisa Ekdahl's fragile voice is the perfect foil for the cool jazz of the Peter Nordahl Trio. The simplicity of the music and song becomes more and more enchanting with each play. Her Scandanavian accent lends just enough uniqueness to these standards to keep them fresh and enjoyable.
1,Returned for repair unsatisfactory,"After little use and only four months after purchase, the power button failed to turn camera off. I returned it for repair and they sent it back saying it was beyond economic repair, due to liquid damage. It was never exposed to any liquid to my knowledge."
3,"Not bad at all, but...","I've had this camera for about a year or so. It was a gift, mainly just to capture those moments in life that you just need to catch.That's what my dad said when he gave it to me anyway.I read all the one star reviews, and I'm happy to say that nothing like what is described in those reviews ever happened to me.I'm not a photography student, but I know if you are seriously into photography this is not the camera for you.Pros; durable, very nice picture quality, nice to look at, many choices of types of shooting to choose from.Cons; horrible battery life (Recommend investing in a lot of rechargeable batteries.) and, this may just be the memory card, but sometimes it takes so long between pictures.Overall, a very nice camera for the average picture taker."
3,Zoom Disappointment,"We have had this camera 18 months and purchased it for the 4x Zoom and 7.1 megapizels. It takes great photos if you have good light and don't use the max zoom. The shutter speed is slow and it won't take photos of moving objects (i.e., my husband and son in a lazy river). Plus the battery life is terrible and rechargable don't last very long.Speed between photos is also slow so I can't capture my little guy doing silly stuff."
3,Too bulky for a point-and-shoot,I owned this product for 3 years.Pros:-Affordable-Uses AA batteries (very convenient)-Big display screen-Good flash-Good zoomCons:-Drains batteries quickly-Quality of pictures not that sharp for the average joe or experienced photographer-Too bulky for pockets
4,GREAT CAMERA,"EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CAMERA IS GREAT, EXCEPT THEY ONLY WENT WITH A 2 BATTERY SYSTEM. THAT MAKES THE BATTERIES NOT LAST AS LONG AS A 4 BATTERY ONE. THAT'S THE ONLY THING WRONG. CANNON MAKES A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IN ALL RESPECTS."
2,camera batteries,"I think this is a complicated camera, gonna take some time to learn. I am very surprised at the battery consumption. I have not used it and the batteries are already low."
3,broke,we had 1 year and had 2 replace or get a re-furbished one. great pics but not durable. liked the size.
3,Well...,"The camera works well and takes great pictures. This is the most important aspect. It was described as being in ""new"" condition, very few scratches. I was disappointed in the condition. It can hardly be described as new. It has dents and scratches. The display has scratches. The most disconcerting thing is the body of the camera feels loose, like it has been dropped at some point. The bottom line is, as long as it works it is worth the price. There were other sellers with the same camera, which might have been better choices."
2,Canon Powershot A560 Review,"I've had this camera for four years and I dislike it very much. The picture quality is atrocious. After a while (depending on how much you use the camera), the camera breaks. The lens cover stopped opening and closing as I powered on and off the camera. Batteries for this camera are a huge expense. Regular batteries only last about 15-20 minutes (also depending on how much you use it) and even if you use lithium batteries they do not last that long. Also the interval between taking pictures is very slow. Another part to thins camera breaking is that half of the settings on mine don't work or broke. The automatic setting breaks quickly and also the camera takes terrible low light pictures, even on the night setting. If you are thinking about getting this camera, I recommend getting a different one."
3,I hope Canon fixed the lens,"My employer provided me with the older A 530 model. It's OK, but the lens has VERY noticeable barrel distortion at the wide end, enough to ruin shots that show buildings or anything else with straight lines (like the ocean horizon). If the 560 has the same lens (and the numbers look the same), then I can't recommend it, even at the price. I hope others will tell me that the newer models have fixed this problem."
5,AMAZING!,"I have an aunt that is a hair stylist, she gave me a perm because I wanted one, But I wanted spiral curls. But due to all the previous damage to my hair from it going from dark brown to blonde and such it was a mess and it was very poofy. So I had a friend who told me about this product. Before I had the perm I could just get right out of the shower let my hair dry and it was perfectly straight! Now after the perm and then this treatment its back to normal! I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to have my hair back to normal!!"
1,Sport Diver II Camera,"I used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it. It took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more, then nothing for the rest of the roll. We swam with sharks and I have nothing to show for it. Should have bought a disposable one."
3,Nice sock but would not consider plus size,"Good quality sock, but not really plus size in the ankle/leg area. Did not seem stretchy enough. I will have to pass them on to my boys who wear 8 men's size."
1,piece of junk,"a while ago my cd player broke, i decided to let it r.i.p. and take my mom's, cos she never uses it. the minute i started listening to it i was disgusted. by what you ask? the same problems as everyone else:*it's flimsy and breaks very easily, and i'm one of those people who uses the special spot on their backpack for cd players.*it skips like a mofo.*THE WHITE NOISE!!!!!*AAA batteries are annoying.*volume doesn't go up that loud.*the ""surround mode"" [...stinks] so bad and makes good music sound [...bad].*the headphones are junk.there is one good thing about it:*it's slim and tiny, but it still has a nice big LCD."
2,Not pleased,"These wireless headphones were easy to install and use but have too much static and are easily blocked so if you even try to adjust them on your ears, you can lose reception for a few seconds. I also don't like the behind the head construction. I wouldn't buy them again. I have a pair of wireless headphones I can use with my PC that work much better, with much nicer sound quality and range."
4,"Nice, cheap wireless headphones.","I purchased these headphones as a cheap solution for hearing the tv while using a loud treadmill fan. The headphones work well.The headphones do not exactly fit my big head but it's good enough. I wear them as much as 45 minutes at a time without issue. Note that these are infra red headphones so you need a clear line of sight between the headphones and the transmitter. At least when u do lose the signal, you dont get the loud static noise in your ear."
3,Lower Your Expectations...,"It's a paradox: even though one good idea or piece of wisdom can expand life infinitely,because of the expense of this program, people considering buying it should be aware that it may be much shorter than they expected (some tapes only run 25 minutes a side), that the speakers even repeat the same anecdotes, and that much of the material is quoted from other sources (particularly poets). The program includes some GEMS, particularly from Deepak Chopra.(I found the tone of the Dyer contributions condescending.) Still, for a person truly looking for ""what it's all about"" (on a limited budget!), I would recommend the ""Living, Healing & Being"" audio series by Mitchell May or ""Creating Your Heart's Desire"" by Sonia Choquette. In closing I would like to say that the speakers' good intentions in creating their program are tangible and thus I hesitated to write this, but for the price, I feel the buyer deserves more."
5,Simply Love is Simply Class,"The purity of Kay's voice is breathtaking! She really knows how to manifest in her songs the heart and soul of a beautiful person. The exquisitely lyrical music, and of course the lyrics themselves, shows an artist of depth beyond her years. She has a great voice that can really touch your heart."
4,One of the best family films I've seen.,"This is a touching, funny film. Definitely for the whole family. Two bumbling ex-con's are suspected of kidnapping a little girl, when in reality she had runaway from home because her parents were to busy to pay attention to her. The ex-cons want to return her but they don't think anyone will believe their side of the story and the little girl is in no hurry to return to her parents. I've looking to buy this film since I first saw it in 1982."
3,Not the best quality but okay for the price I paid.,"The quality of the movie was less then par. It looked like someone took the original vhs and just copied it onto a dvd. I can't really complain though. The price I paid gave me the quality I deserved, I guess.... So to sum it up. Great price for vhs quality movie."
4,I loved this movie...,"I loved this movie when I was five. I even insisted that we name my little sister Savannah. I can't say that I'd stand in line to see this movie again, but if you have a five year old, it's sure to be a hit."
5,Why?,"I am just wondering why Savannah Smiles is not being made? I think it is a must see classic! There are a lot of no name movies out there you can buy, so is this just a way make people suffer?"
4,old but very cute,This movie I was when i was a little girl and I have been looking for it and I finally found it. This is one of the sweetest cutest movies ever. I always forget that every single time it makes me cry but other than that it is a really great movie. I hope all of you enjoy!
5,Funny and sweet movie!,"Over the years I have watched this movie several times. It is somewhat dated, but still worth a watch. Try it."
5,savannah smiles,"Savannah Smiles was the very first movie I saw when I got cable 25 yrs ago. My husband, myself and my 3 children thoroughly enjoyed the movie then and were even more happier to see it again now. And we sat there and watched it two more times that day, that's how much we loved it."
3,Count on 2 weeks shipping,The product came as advertised but took almost 2 weeks to come in the mail.
5,Beloved movie from childhood,"I loved this movie as a child and loved when I watched it again as an adult. I wouldn't recommend it for small children to watch though, but older children and adults should watch this movie at some point in their lives. You gotta love Savannah. It makes you think about how much your kids know and how much they pick up on from parents and how naive they can be at the same time. Great movie. Maybe I'll watch it again tonight!"
3,Informative but a difficult to decipher,"I found this book difficult to digest. The language used throughout appears to be some form of official medical speak; so much so that - as an example - in one section, I could not determine whether the author advocated drinking cranberry juice or not (until the last sentence of that sections which seemed to suggest that it is a benefit). That being said, I found the information useful although not very clearly presented. I look forward to a revised edition in which the editor(s) revises the language so that it is comprehensible to those without a medical or nutrition background."
5,Must read if you like history or people!!,I found this book a few years ago and read it cover to cover! Let us say that history is stranger than fiction. You will also learn that some of the scandals we have now have been done way before in American history. A great example is the voting debacle in Florida with George Bush. That was not the first time it has happened in American history regarding a presidential election miscount!! I am on this page now because I gave away this book years ago and REGRET it!I was watching a documentary on Sacco and Vanzetti and realized I had read about it in this book years ago!!MUST READ!!!
4,my thoughts,"i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was fantastic, the acting as well as the presentation. for a change it lived up to my expectations. thanks."
3,gran torino,This movie missed a golden opportunity to educate the american people of the great sacrifice of the Hmong people and the ongoing genocide of these people for their fierce fighting along side of our troops in Viet Nam.
1,SAD RACIAL STEREO TYPES BONUS POOR ACTING,"All I can say is my Love for Clint has been tested.Words like ""cracker"" ""hunky"". Did Archie Bunker write this?The slang was dated, obviously from his Dirty Harry days.Clint lines were the only ones delivered with meaning.The other ""actors"" sounded like they were rehearsing for a school play.The fondation was set, but nothing but nonsense was built upon it.The over zealous Father from the church was laughable.The Mhoung gang was funny as well.We found ourselves laughing at inappropriate times.PRO: NOT AS AWFUL AS SPIKE LEE'S MIRACLE AT ST ANNA."
1,Horrible!!!!,"To this day I still do not understand the praise this movie gets! I get what the movie is trying to do. I get the whole racism, old man in a new world, coming to terms with yourself...blah blah blah. Those things are all well and good if they are done in a halfway decent fashion. First off the acting is on par with any Soap Opera on TV. I could barley sit the through the thing because of this. I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie. Second the whole story is just corny as hell. This is pretty much it ""Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace "". The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass. It was so over dramatized....I can't even stand to talk about movie.Do you self a favor and skip this Over Hyped piece of garbage!"
3,Eastwood works.,"Haven't had time to watch it, but like Eastwood movies and heard it had good reviews."
5,Great movie to own.,If you like Clint Eastwood you will enjoy having this movie in your collection. I recommend this movie to all audiences.
5,Clint Eastwood fans should buy this movie!,"This movie is a must have for Clint Eastwood fans. You will laugh, cry and go through a wide range of emotions from watching this film."
4,I'm no hero.,"Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't. Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted. The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one. Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone. She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it. The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy. The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off. Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power."
3,Grand Torino DVD (Full Screen Edition),"All I Can Say Is, So I Don't Give Away What The Movie is About Is That I Did Not Like The Ending."
2,How the Clint Stole Christmas,"Seriously, can you believe this insipid film? At best, it's a good episode of ""CHiPS"" -- at worst, a bad episode of ""CHiPS"". And what horrid acting, all around! Hard to actually see Clint's heart growing bigger, but you know it did. Well, you assume as much. Don't you?"
5,Amazing Film,"I saw a review earlier that mentioned the movie ""Crash,"" which was a terribly overrated film. ""Crash"" does not compare to the brilliance of Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino."" This movie teaches a wonderful lesson and does so beautifully.Being Eastwood's last starring role in a film, he did a magnificent job at creating a believable character.I could go into more details about the film, but this is one that everyone should see for themselves. Words will not do it justice."
1,not that into it,"I'm not crazy about this movie. I think the best part of the whole movie is the ending. When Walt leave's his house to the church. Instead of his son's family. They don't deserve that house after the way they were to him. I'm also happy that he gave his car to that chines kid instead of his granddaughter. She also doesn't deserve anything,"
3,Gran Torino,Loved the movie but the closed captioning did not work so I tough it out when I watch this film. This is the second DVD that was sent out because the first one would not load or play and I kept getting the message of error on disc.
3,One of Eastwoods best...,"Movie is GREAT! Have watched it several times and it clearly is a masterpiece. I am only giving this item 3 stars though due to the lack of special features on the disk, It is presented like a poor quality dvd with no special features, menu sucks, cheap case and insert, etc. A shame really that they would treat a movie that way..."
2,Missed opportunity to be a great film- Instead of a cliche,"I enjoyed most of this film. However, I agree with others that the film relies on contrivances and an unoriginal storyline. It seems that the writer felt that the film had two possible ways to go: One way could be the ""Dirty Harry"" route where Eastwood brilliantly gets violent revenge on the bad guys...Or, the other possible ending could be melodramatic with much hanky-wringing and a ""message"". Neither option is appealing given the age and health of the main character...and the values he was trying to teach the young man. There was a huge missed opportunity to tell a different story based on the certain realities that each of the characters must accept. This could have been a great film...Instead it's just more of the same."
4,I can't hear you!,"We rented this movie this week and the sound was so quiet, we couldn't even watch it! We turned up the TV as loud as it could go (far too loud for anything else we were watching) and still missed a lot of dialogue. The checkout attendant at Blockbuster had the same problem. So did our friend from Texas who came to visit.You can make it work if you have your TV hooked up to a sound system that can crank up the volume, but if you are watching it on just a TV set, you won't be able to hear much.If you get this movie, buy a stereo system to go with it."
5,Gran Torino,"Great movie. I'm a Clint Eastwood fan. It was funny, sad, and the ending was a great surprise. It is a movie you will keep thinking about."
4,Great movie but BluRay price lowers the score,"As with almost all Clint Eastwood films, he has again come through with an impactful creation. There is someone in this movie that you can identify with, no matter who you are. Mr. Eastwood solicited people with the right heritage to be his stars. Unknowns and the real deal. That's one reason you can feel the emotions.I rate the film itself a five plus but the high prices for BluRay just make my blood boil. It's the music CD rip off all over again."
5,I love Clint Eastwood so I had to get it.,This movie turned out to be a great movie. Not just because I like the actor so much but because it had such a wonderful plot. It made you feel that even in troubled areas in our cities it can take only one person to make a difference. Really it is a great movie and I'm not a big movie purchaser but this one I have watch several times.
3,"Good performance, disappointing recorded sound","I heard Salonen and the LA Phil perfrom this at Avery Fisher Hall in New York over a year ago, and it was a revelation-- they played the music like they owned it. Salonen's easy going way with the tempi and his way of getting the orchestra to sneak up on climaxes just did it for me. So, this recording was one I looked forward to. Most regretably, Sony seems to have sabotaged the project. The sound is tight, closed in, way under recorded--yes, this can happen with digital recording-- and lacks the sense of space Bruckner demands. There are great moments,. but you have to experience them through a subtle haze. The horn opening disappoints as well, although in general the brass are great in ensemble. I have noticed this stinginess in recorded ambience in other LA Phil recordings on SONY; what's the deal?"
3,Great book for the Al-Qadim campaign setting.,"It's a very nice book to have around. Very good refrence, or just to get a better look at Zakkhara."
3,Good quality but does not include the entire alphabet!,"This is a great toy and made in the USA to boot! However, if you are looking for a toy to help teach your child the Hebrew alphabet, look elsewhere, as not all of the Hebrew letters are included in this set."
5,Well worth the investment.,"I sell products in Israel and love the Hebrew letters. I bought this product to decorate my little store. I scattered them about. Whenever my children come to work with me they play with them. They are so attractive that customers wanted to buy them. I now sell them individually. One block at a time. Each one is like a tiny piece of art. I have run out of them and need to buy more. They are durable and perfect for a baby, toddler and older children. Even adults will enjoy them. I love them."
4,good toy,"I don't do much electronic works these days for me to say whether this is good or not, but I like the auto-range feature of this product, and it gives you a battery tester (small batteries). I liked this one over the ones, they were selling at home-depot mainly because it had auto-range, and was similar price."
3,multimeter,"When i ordered this i probably should have waited until i had a better understanding of what i needed. One problem for me is thae the display is hard to read when it is laying flat on my workbench. Especialy the top of the display which shows if it is displaying in ohms, kilo-ohms or megaohms. If i had to do it over again i would not have bought an auto-ranging meter. Otherwise it works good."
4,Great for the money,"This a pretty nice multi meter for the price. A perfect gift for the gadgeteer in the family, especially the younger ones that you don't want to lose the one out of Dad's toolbox."
5,I really love it!,I bought this long time ago and still having it around. It is always there when you need it. Very accurate reading (regarding the price) and nice display.
1,Seemed great....,"I really liked the price on this meter and after countless times of using it I have had it. I just missed the return date from amazon and I am really bummed about it. This thing takes forever to sync if it even does. I have had countless dead batteries that I wanted to test and after leaving the tester on for 5 minutes it still does not register volts of any sort... just keeps going from 155 to 0... Not sure if it is just my tester but I have since replaced it with a 5 dollar junk tester that I can manually select that gives me the reading I want asap. More tech isn't always better and this one is a great example of that. No disrespect against equus, I have a number of their tools and they work great, just not this one."
4,Good little inexpensive tester,"I actually have two of these and got a second one because I liked the first so much. For the money, these are surprisingly functional and useful. The units do tend to smell rather strongly like cheap plastic, however, and at this point I'm not sure how well they will hold up longer-term, but so far so good."
4,Good Multimeter,"I'm a newb when it comes to doing things with electricity so this was my first attempt at using a multimeter. The price of this unit scared me but I took a chance and have not been disappointed. I really like the big display as it make for easy reading in some tight spaces. If you want top-o-the-line go Fluke and be prepared to spend fluke money. But if your a weekend warrior like myself, you won't be disappointed in this unit."
1,Worked great for thee months...,"It worked great for three months, then died. I tried putting fresh batteries in it, but that didn't help. Will never buy another Equus product again."
1,Broke Almost Immediately,"I was impressed by the perfomance of this product... until it broke irreparably about 2 weeks after I bought it. Unfortunately, I was out of the country and have missed the deadline for returns, so I've lost $25."
1,Didn't read review~NOT for DS Lite,"**This charger does not work with DS Lite**I did not read the last review, so had to find out the hard way that the charger I had bought does NOT work with the Nintendo DS Lite. I highly recommend the seller re-wording your title to read ""Nintendo DS"" (not DS lite) so that no one else makes the same mistake. It is a bit misleading IMHO. I guess I should know if there is a difference between DS and DS Lite, but this was a gift for my daughter, and I am not gaming savvy enough to know the difference!"
4,No complaints,The product works as intended and has lasted for a couple of years now (with intermittent use). Seems to be holding up fine.
2,Buy the albums themselves,"This is just another compilation album. It takes tracks from Trash(89), Hey Stoopid(91) and The Last Temptation(93). However being a fan of all 3 of those albums I can tell you that you will be more satsfied buying those 3 albums on there own rather then this.However, if you havent heard anything from those 3 albums apart from Poison, then this may be a pretty good introduction to this ere of Alice's music. But then again, so would buying all the albums rather then the compilatations."
4,Quality product only one complaint,"The clock is made well and I like the fact that it has two timers built into one. However, I wish it would shut off automatically when not in use."
3,Fair,The case was cracked in three different places. The cd had some scratches on it that I had to clean off. The cd did arrive in the time period it was supposed to it was just ar the end of the time period.
4,Great,"A crash course into the heart of the ever developing music industry is something that every record producer, musician and publisher out there wants to read. Especially useful for rookies and people just starting out this guide might be the next bible of the industry, with step by step structure and an almost infinite amount of very useful information. A great read to be recommended to all that are curious about making it big in the music industry, and a book to follow by all involved in this area. A 101 crash course that is heading for success ."
5,Great children's bible,I love this bible! I have been waiting to buy a bible for my 3 year old because I wanted the best. I wanted a bible with realistic and artistic illustrations and good literature. This bible has these qualities.
2,Buy this if you feel like wasting $45,"This cd player is really junky. there are so many down sides to it. 1)the headphones are really cheap. They were made of cheap plastic, and broke very easily. 2) The anti-skip feature is basically useless, since it still skipped when it was activated. 3) it's pretty bulky. 4)It doesn't play very long when you use 2 AA bateries instead of the AC adapter. 5) it doesn't play CD-R cd's. The only reason why I still gave this product 2 stars was because it was pretty good when it was new, and everything worked perfectly. However, this product is NOT worth it for the price. To be honest, a cheap CD player like this should be priced for $15."
2,Low Capacity - Cheap Tire,"Bought these to replace a lost smaller 16"" wheel. Hub can be knocked out for a 1"" axle. The Wheels are fine, going slow over perfectly smooth terrain or with low weight loads. I had my wheels loaded (heavy) and they ""potatoe Chipped"" in that the wheel completely changed shape and the rubber came off. Easy enough to put back the rubber back on, but I'm looking for replacement."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD,"Actually, the movie is funny and very good. But, it is the DVD which made me think twice. I have one word for this Sruthilayam DVD - GARBAGE. There is no other word I can think of, other than GARBAGE.The reason behind is the WORST VIDEO QUALITY and mp3 like audio quality. The quality degraded to levels unseen in DVDs. It actually hurt human senses to watch such pathetic work ""mastered"" by equally unscrupulous and despicable people. In short all my excitement turned into immense frustration (to see so many new DVDs from Sruthilayam by degrading their quality). The main reason though I feel is that they are putting two tamil movies in one DVD and hence, GARBAGE DVD comes out.If there is a negative rating, I would like to give ""Negative 5 star"" for the quality of this DVD and many other DVD from Sruthilayam"
3,too theoritical,"This one is too academic and difficult to digest, although it (probably) has some good ideas. Applying them is the question? Reminds of of Lebowitz's book on KM."
2,Photocopy cover,"Wow thought Amazon could afford an actual original cover for this movie----well the distributor should anyway!! Crapy artwork- hope movie is not of same low quality, as I got it for a friend."
2,Do NOT buy it if you're going for animation...,"I read the book and saw that the book teaches you more of a CAD style MAX than the MAX that an animator would like to see. If you want to design kitchens and bathrooms, this book is for you. If you want to design or animate characters...move on to something else."
2,Not exactly what I had expected...,"As a musician, I realize how important it is to keep an audience interested with both the proformence and the MUSIC. These guys put on a great energy filled show but after listening to the CD without them in my presence I was highly dissapointed. Maybe it's just me but I just don't think they were all that good from a hardcore perspective, they were just too soft on most aspects of their music. On a final note, these guys put on a great show, but don't waste your money on this CD."
3,Riding the wave of Blue Like Jazz,"Miller wrote an excellent book in Blue Like Jazz and he is attempting to ride the wave of popularity that he gained from that book as he wrote this book. Unfortunately this book seemed rather contrived and lacking the authenticity found in Blue Like Jazz. Some of the stories are really good, but overall it is poorly put together and it doesnt bring any resolution that I can see."
2,Searching For God Knows What,"I have recently finished reading ""Searching For God Knows What"" by Donald Miller. Normally it would take a few days to a week to finish a book this size but I have been really stuck on this one for some reason. I don't think it's the actual message that is a turn off for me but just the writing style. I questioned some of the book on whether it was true but I'm far from being able to tell it if it is or not. Sometimes I didn't know if he was agreeing or disagreeing with himself and I just felt a bit lost. I feel that as someone who is beginning a journey of studying the bible and doesn't know a lot about it that this was just over my head at the moment. I hope to come back to it one day and reread it with a new perspective. From reviews I've read there is a lot of praise for this book mixed with a lot of criticism. I do suggest reading it for yourself to see if it's your kind of book."
4,Such a neat perspective . . .,"I borrowed this book from a friend. I think it has a great perspective on living a christian life. I took many ideas from this book. The biggest one is that we don't need to worry about what anybody thinks of us, because God is the only one who matters in the end. I think it would be a great book for a teen to read that may be struggling with peer pressure. He is a good author.JLB"
5,love this book.,"I love this book. I can read it over and over. His perspectives are so awesome, fresh, and unique. The descriptions of what he thinks Jesus looks like changed my perspective forever. I love the story about the lifeboat and countless other things. Great book!"
4,Don Miller is a good story teller,"I like to read people's personal stories that reveal the private struggles of their inner world. Don Miller does that in this book, not overly introspective, mind you, but enough vulnerability that caused me to identify with what he was writing about.This book, seemed to me, to be like hanging with a friend over big cups of strong coffee and staying up late to talk about whatever.I like his writing style.And for me, being from Portland, I very much enjoyed Miller's local references. I love this city and I can tell he does, too.(...)"
2,"Do some research, man.","This book insulted my intelligence. I just finished taking a semester survey course on the Old Testament, and it was painful to see how much scripture Miller took out of context. Also, like another reviewer, I was bothered by the fact that he kept referring to Moses as the author of Gen-Deut. If he would do some scholarly research instead of just thinking really hard about things, this book would have been a whole lot better. Also, ""Blue Like Jazz"" is ten times better and easier to read."
3,The school boredom,"Ok, I dont usually read books, though if they strike my fancy I might think about it. I have to read books for school for a thing called reading counts. Anyway I like Sci-Fi books more than any other. This was a fairly good book, though draggy in some areas it kept my attention (which is hard to do). Over all this is a fairly good book, read it if you have some free time."
4,Your Hit Parade - The Unforgettable '50's,"I am a great fan of 1950's music. However, I purchased this CD specifically for one song - Guess Who by Jesse Belvin. Unfortunately, the listing was incorrect and the song is not actually on the CD. I was disappointed. Otherwise, the CD is great."
4,Fast Shipping! Top title!,"Very funny, but I think it is a little bit short, round about 1 hour! Wish this DVD wasn't the last one of the Axis ;-)"
5,BEST BLOWDRYER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been using the Elchim blow dryer for about 10 years now. This is by far the best of the best. I am very surprised that people have had issues with the cord breaking. I have NEVER had that issue. But, I think like everything you buy, maybe you/they weren't so lucky. I have hair so thick and long. I do not think that their is anyone that has as much hair as I do. This blow dryer dries my hair so fast and leaves it so shiny! I recommend this blow dryer to anyone. Worth every single penny!"
1,Warning!!! Fire may shoot out of cord/handle connection during use,"While my wife was using the Elchim Professional Type 2001 1500/1800W hair dryer to dry her hair, FLAMES - yes that's right flames, not sparks - shot out of the base of the handle at the point where the power cord enters.This was totally unexpected since the wire and handle showed no visible signs of damage. Thankfully, my wife was not injured. However, please be aware that this may occur with this dryer and could cause serious injury to someone. My wife has had the dryer for 3 or 4 years and has not abused it.I emailed Elchim to advise them of the problem and asked if they would like to test the dryer to see what may have caused it. I told them I would be happy to send it to them if they sent me a prepaid shipping label. After receiving no response, I sent a follow up email. Still no response.My only intention is to alert buyers/users of this potential danger so that no one gets hurt."
5,Has lasted over 10 years,"I bought this when I was in college as a huge splurge, and I still can't get over the fact that it's still going strong. It still dries my hair super quickly and I've been using it since 2000!! I dont think I have anything else in my apt that has lasted this long."
3,Not Good for Fine Hair,"Having baby fine hair and not a lot of it, I find my hair feels more dry and brittle after using this dryer for the last month. There are 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, the 1st heat setting being ""cool"". The 1st speed setting is too low even for my hair. The highest speed and heat settings are way to strong and burning hot for my head. The switch placement is a pain as you have to be careful not to accidently hit them when holding the handle. I don't think this dryer is worth its higher price."
2,not for younger women,"As a recently diagnosed 28-yr.old, this book depressed me more than informed or enlightened me. The women in the author's online circle are mostly 40-50 yrs. old, and while they have years of experiencing problems with MS, much of their info is outdated, as they were diagnosed, or not diagnosed with outdated methods, such as before the MRI came about, etc., whereas I got a diagnosis within a week or two after my first onset of an episode with the slew of testing at a wonderful clinic. Also, their experiences or episodes can be treated today, though they perhaps couldn't be treated 20 years ago. My problems are under control through the treatments available today, but reading these stories made it sound like I was in for an intolerable haul. I would not recommend this book to a younger (<30) MS patient because so much is outdated and actually lead me to a bout of depression."
3,Not uplifting as I had hoped...,"I had hoped to find a book filled with encouragement. However, that is not how I felt while reading this book. As a woman living with MS, I have found that a positive attitude is the only way to go. Much of this book bemoans the limitations MS has placed on the lives of the writers (and some is simply whining-sorry ladies). I would have loved to read more of what inspires them to live their lives to the fullest."
1,WARNING: This product does NOT work,"Actually, my rating for this product isn't one star, it is ZERO. My husband is an engineer: after many exasperating days of having the program either ""go nuts"" or simply crash, he has had enough. If an engineer can't make it work...well, you get the idea."
1,Polarized Opinion at its Finest,"Being a politically interested citizen I have delved into the current swarm of political rants flooding the book stores both praising and demonizing Bush and have come to the same conclusion about this book as ""Unfit for Command"" (perhapse the least credible of the lot). If you really do believe Bush to be an able, clear-headed, ""compassionate"" leader then you will probably find Matter of Character compelling and affirming of your views as well as a reasonably engaging read. The sources are articulated in a clear enough fasion for political literature and nothing is ground-breaking enough to necessitate any truly inspirational journalism. On the other hand if you believe Bush to be an elitist, simple-minded bully, cowing to a manipulative old-boy network then you will fundamentally dissagree with not only the marginally researched basis of this book but its conclusions as well."
1,Nothing But trouble,"I hate this modem, I havent had anything but trouble out of it. It took forever to get it up and running. When it would connect it would loose its connection soon. I ran new phone lines and done everything to correct the problem- the best solution I found was to pull it out of my machine"" a pentium 2 350 meg with 192m of ram"" and throw it away. I put my old 33.6 off brand back in my computer and that is what I use now."
2,THIS 56K IS VERY DISSAPOINTING!,"I really do not like this 56k. It is hard to hook up and it keep booting me off!!!!! I hate it!. I dont think this is worth anything. three words, dont buy it!"
4,Halo Benders earn their wings on The Rebels Not In,"This side project for Built to Spill's Doug Martsch and Beat Happening's Calvin Johnson, in the past, has been like most side projects: Good but don't quit your day job. On The Rebel's Not In, however, they finally release an album that can stand on its own merit. It is by far their best put together and sounding album. The songs seem less like their almost spoken-word earlier material and more like, well, songs. The odd pairing of Martsch and Johnson's voices achieve a kind of strangely appealing harmony. The dynamic duo are in no danger of ever waking to find this album in the Top 40, but it possesses a quirky sensibility that is, at the very least, unique."
1,"Disgusting, didn't even bother to finish it","This author certainly left nothing to the imagination, and I really wish he had. It was disgusting pretty much from page one. I didn't even bother to finish it, and haven't watched a Bogart movie since. Thought about donating to the library, but would feel bad if someone actually read it. This one is worthy of the trash can and not much else.Bogart may have been that much of a degenerate, but this book is really too much information. And I'm really disappointed that the TCM (Turner Classic Movies) web site even suggested it."
1,"cruel, cruel book","I refuse to rate this book at all. This is one of the cruelest books I have ever read. I read it while sitting at the bookstore. It is filled with such ridiculous imaginary conversations and half-truths...the author knows enough about certain dates, etc., to manage to concoct lengthy conversations that never took place. If the families of everyone vilified in this terrible book don't file lawsuits for slander, character assasination, and libel, then there is no justice at all. I happen to love Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck. If they were alive, they would be enraged and filing these lawsuits themselves.This ""author"" should be ashamed of himself. So should anyone who reads this book and feels ""enlightened."" This is utter trash.Shame on anyone who writes such drivel and profits from it."
3,track listing,"I was ripping this prior to putting it on my father's Ipod and the copy I have seems to have a few different tracks than those mentioned in the previous review. Maybe Time-Life changed them between issues.Since there isn't a listing here:1. Dust My Broom - Elmore James2. I'm A King Bee - Slim Harpo3. Got My Mojo Working - Muddy Waters4. Spoonful - Howling Wolf5. Big Boss Man - Jimmy Reed6. Bad, Bad Whiskey - Amos Wilburn7. Frosty - Albert Collins8. Farther Up The Road - Bobby ""Blue"" Bland9. I Can't Quit You Baby - Otis Rush10.

2,Not one of her best.,"I was very disappointed with Lorrie'snew album. It does not have the typicalLorrie sound to it, and I think it ismore pop than anything. I'm sorry butI do not like it."
4,Lorrie Is Back,"Lorrie is back with her newest release, My Heart. It's a 11 song collection of the ups and downs of love. The first single is the power ballad duet with Sammy Kershaw titled Maybe Not Tonight. Lorrie has the gift to choose good songs, songs good enough for radio if given time and airplay. One of the standout tracks is the Bryan Adams cover of ""The Only Good Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You"", a good rockin tune. Overall the album is a treat, my fave track is the title track."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book, but it can be slow in parts and the ending is sort of abrupt- it just, stops after Colleen has her pups. Overall, 4-4 1/2 stars, and I would reccomend it. Get reading."
2,Not Much on Anne...,"I had great hopes for this book, however, there is very little information on Anne, herself. While the suvivor accounts in the book are certainly interesting and valuable historically, if you are truly seeking details on Anne's last few months, you will not find it here."
5,A Must Read,"Whenever I feel depressed, defeated, worthless and hopeless, I read this book. I've read this book more than once. Every time I read it, I gain courage and strength. This book is my Bible. It touches my heart and soul."
3,"Some good ideas, but heavy on jargon and distraction","This book loses its momentum by focusing on jargon and buzzwords intead of clear and solid points. The effort of reading this book is not a complete loss - there are some good suggestions and models, but any of Gerald Weinbergs books are shorter and better reads with 10x less pretension and unnecessary complexity."
2,Don't Bother !,"OK, it gets two stars for being German and it is mixed together. The music selections are just not that good. I would suggest ""COP / Infiltrate & Corrupt"" which you can also get at a bargain price."
5,Clear skies!,"The 2002 Hubble calendar is even better than the 2001! More nebulae and even a Herbig-haro object. The Ring Nebula, the Eskimo Nebula, and a beautiful blue reflection nebula are my favorites. Last year's had a couple radio images and planetary images that weren't as spectacular as the deep-space ones; 2002 is all deep-space.As last year, this year has multiple factoids on most days of the month. Birthdays of famous astronomers and physicists, milestones in science, and acheivements in the Space Race. Definitely recommended for anyone who loves to ""keep looking up."""
2,"Over Alarming, Somewhat Informative","This book made me anxious and distraught about my daughter's condition with allergies. The author used many dark examples of negative allergic reactions. What an eye opener to all of the things that can happen to your child! However, I felt much of the advice and guidance was lost when the extreme consequences were used for every case example. One of the first chapters did offer some consolence that I was not alone - something that I appreciated reading. It is hard to remember that when you see non-allergic toddlers that can try a bite of any food that they want."
3,Nice,"Well as is stated in another review it is nice to have this Francis movie for those of us who are true fans. Her musical scenes are by far the best, Waiting For Billy is a very nice one with great shots of Connie. The best thing about this movie is the transfer, they (WB) did a great job. THe color and clearity are top notch. I enjoyed it after all these years. If you are a Connie fan so will you."
4,gorky park,"this is a great cd from the band gorky park. lots of good rockers and a few ballads in there too. too bad there not together, this cd makes up for the band. so crank it up man...."
1,Tread Softly,"Truly, this is probaly not today's preteen's cup of tea. YOu have to keep in mind throughout that this book was written quite some time ago. To me at least. ^_^ It's basically about a girl named Katie who lives on Apple Street and is sick of all the boys who live there. She has lots of brothers but her friends all live farther away. She hates boys. And she also very chastely discovers them. Wow. I was bombarded with bad illustrations in my copy (a discard from the library) that looked as if they had been drawn by some well-meaning 5tb garder. Any boy hating young, young girls might enjoy this book as it's rather short- I think about 108 pages, but please don't read it for a complicated plot or amazing, well written characters or anything like that...."
3,Good CD with Technical Flaws,"This CD has good music and excellent sound quality, but there are some issues with it. The big one that I noticed right away is that the record company placed the track markings after some of the songs had already started. This tells your CD player when to start the next track if you are flipping through songs. A lot of the beginnings of the songs get cut off. You have to go back to the end of the previous song to even hear them. If you want to listen to this start to finish, you will never be bothered, but it makes scanning to a certain song really annoying."
3,Pretty Good!,"Not the best I've ever heard from ibiza, but decent enough to give it a passing grade of C+ Both cd's carry thier own great tracks, but some of the other tracks could have been replaced with better ones out there..."
5,their own thing,"It's amazing, this digital age. Here are two guys who have been hoofing it in local bars for 30 years, then decided to make their own record. They wrote all the songs, then produced & engineered the entire album on a home digital studio, and did a fine job of it. Randy Hoggatt probably could have 'made it' as a musician if he'd been willing to leave Coffeyville, Ks., and Mike Hughey is an extremely talented producer/engineer. They both respect each other's particular talents and it shows in this CD. Hoggatt does the heavy work performance-wise, doing almost all the lead vocals and guitar work, whereas Hughey did all the production and engineering.To their credit, they don't sound like anybody else. At the same time, the entire CD has a good, consistant ambience.Whether or not you like the cd will depend on your musical tastes, but 'Changes' is certainly a professional piece of work that these guys should be proud of."
4,Johnny Fontane's Best!,"I was introduced to Al Martino via his role in the Godfather. His marvelous voice and charm as he serenades Connie is a scene that I always remember when I hear Mr. Martino sing.Despite not having ""I Have but One Heart"", this compilation still is quite stellar for all Al Martino fans. Songs introduced to me in this compilation that I found to be excellent are ""Wiedersehn"", ""Sausalito"", and my favorite ""To the Door of the Sun"".Al smoothly performs the range of traditional to more modern tones. This CD is worth a look and a buy."
4,"GREAT SHOW, GOOD CD","True, some of numbers that made the show such a joy were not included in the CD, but what is here more than makes up for it. Some of these songs have never been recorded in these arrangements, some never even recorded before. Having been witness to the show at its world premiere in Toronto, I can honestly say the show has grown and the CD is testament to that fact. Listen with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed."
3,The show is great- the CD is not,"I just saw Fosse in NY yesterday, and i thought it was amazing. But I wasn't expecting it to be good at all when i first walked in, because this CD is just not that good. Except for numbers like Big Spender and Sing, Sing, Sing, the CD on a whole seems very dull and lifeless, but on stage, even the dullest of songs (except for maybe the incomprehensible ""Cool Hand Luke"") was one fantastic event after another. See the show, but don't waste your time with the CD, and DEFINETLY don't judge the show from just listening to the CD."
3,Needs The Visuals,"The Tony-winning production of ""Fosse"" was an excellent revue of Mr. Fosse's contributions to Broadway, but doesn't exactly translate as well to cd. Still, a nice ""highlights"" buy!Best tracks include:Life Is Just A Bowl Of CherriesBig SpenderRich Man's FrugHot Honey RagSing! Sing! Sing!The voices and orchestrations are good, but I would suggest purchasing the original cast albums instead.Try ""Chicago"" or ""Sweet Charity"" for the best examples."
5,"104 year old Grandma""Boba"" loves it",Excellent Second Grade reader and Great service. This was my 104 year old Grandma's second grade reader. When i read the poems to her she recites them with me. What a memory she has. She has almost all of them memorized from it from back when she went to a one room school house in Ellsworth County Kansas. She will say isn't there one in there about such and such and i will find it and read to her.
5,"Drying Rack, what do you expect?","This drying rack is great, as has been said in other reviews it is a little smaller than some of the more expensive ones you can buy. But overall it is really nice I use it almost everyday and it has worked like you would expect a drying rack to do, my clothes are dry by the next day and ready for hanging up in my closet. The metal doesn't really bother me but if you are against a metal drying rack then don't buy this one. I would recommend this for a single person not multiple people as it is (as was said before) smaller and if you live in an apartment this would be perfect for you."
1,poor quality control,"these pens are cheap and when they write, they do write really well. unfortunately, about a quarter of them just never write. this is the second or third box i've had, and it happens every time ... i thought, for a while, it was just bad luck but now i know better and i'll never buy these crappy pens again. when you consider the price against only 3/4 of the box, it's no longer that cheap. i'll stick with pilot g-2 - they cost a little more, but they all WRITE, which is about the sole quality i desire in a pen!"
1,Mediocre,"What a mediocre martial arts film. Don Wilson is a great marital artist, but his acting skills need serious work. In fact, most of the story was so lame, the films only saving grace was Terry Farrell. Not a great part for her either, but she did the best she could with the material and what she was given. Her performance was...ok. But in the end nothing could save this film from becoming a horrid direct to video B-movie release compared to superior action/martial arts movies."
2,Poor condition,"The book was in poor condition, inside and out. Regardless of it having been an old library book, it was described as being in ""good"" condition, which I understood to mean that it was in ""good"" condition despite the fact that it was a library book, not in ""good"" condition for a library book. Simply put, what I actually received is not what I expected to receive, based on the seller's descriptions."
5,Historical Perspective,This special edition thoroughly covered the historical perspective of reading instruction in America and is an excellent resource in the field of reading.
3,You get what you pay for,"We ordered this as an interim wedding band for my husband while his real one was being made. It scratches and dings easily, but it served its purpose."
5,The Best of the Melodic Metal Genre,"I've listened to several of Jorn's works from ""Worldchanger"" to Ark's ""Burn the Sun,"" and while they were solid cd's, I didn't think there was anything special about either. I think that Masterplan has finally found Jorn finding his place in the metal realm. This has got to be the best cd that I've listened to this year...by far! Very melodic, but also fast paced. I liked everything about this album, but I guess if I had to pick, my favorite tracks would be...""Spirit Never Dies, Enlighten Me, Kindhearted Light, Crystal Night, Soulburn, Heroes, and Through Thick and Thin (bonus track on Japanese version). To me, Masterplan is most assuredly a cd of the new millenium with echoes of the best metal of the 80's!"
4,I like it.,"You will not find a more cost efficient Ac Adaptor for powering your guitar pedals. This one rocks. If you are plaining on hooking up more then 5 pedals, I would recommend you spending more and getting a Ac Adaptor that has more mA's like the -Godlyke PA9 Universal Pedal Power SupplyAll in all this is a great product for the price. Go grab it if you are in the market for a Ac Adaptor.Casey Schultheis"
1,Broken in 10 seconds,I connected to Fender Mini Tone Master and strummed my guitar a few times. Then it was broken within 10 seconds. I also heard there was some noise while no nose with 9v battery. Maybe the voltage in Australia is 240v and it was not suitable. I would not recommend to the users in the country with high voltage. The price was reasonable and it may work for most of people. But it was just a waste for me.
3,How to learn to use extrasensory perception,"Jane Roberts is probably best known as a channel of Seth, an ""energy personality essence no longer focused in physical reality."" She first encountered him while testing the ouija board for this book.Jane Roberts thinks everyone has, and also unconsciously uses, ESP powers. In the book she presents various exercises to learn to use them consciously. There is a chapter dedicated to each of them, from telepathy to clairvoyance and past life recall. Each chapter also has Seth's comments."
5,Betty Blue,"The music fits in perfectly with the movie. I'm a Gabriel Yared fan myself - he actually answers his email, gang! Go to his website and see for yourself!!Five stars for this soundtrack.P.S., Now hear this, yes the songs are short - but still, I can listed to it at my desk for an extended period of time without having to change it. I don't find it boring at all..."
5,"A ""feel good"" film that really made me feel good","Based on a true story, this 2002 film is well made and inspiring. It's set in Ireland in 1953 and stars Pierce Brosnan as a working-class carpenter with three children. When his wife abandons him, the children are taken away because Irish law at that time did not allow a father to bring up his children. What follows is the story of his legal battles to get his children back.The script is wonderful with just the right amount of building tension. Sophie Vavasseur is cast as the 10-year old daughter and she does a great job. So does the rest of the cast which includes Julianna Margulies as Brosnan's love interest and Stephen Rea as his lawyer.This is a ""feel-good"" film and I really did feel good at the happy ending. Recommended"
5,GREAT SERVICE,"RECIEVED MOVIE W/ IN 7 DAYS OF ORDERING. ITEM WAS CHRISTMAS PRESENT & IT ARRIVED IN NEW CONDITION AS PROMISED. WILL BE USING THIS SELLER IN FUTURE. ****DO NOT USE HERMAN STREET FOR ANY PURCHASE- THEY ARE CROOKS, THEIVES & LIARS****"
5,Well worth waiting for,"This album is a wonderful mix of rockers and ballads. It shows that concrete blonde has matured but not lost there edge. It is made up of the stuff that makes up all there albums. Love, freindship, comments about the state of the world. Violent is very chilling given the events of Sept 11. Roxy is catchy and fun. ""When I WasA Fool is a telling and vulnerable song of the sort Johnette Napolitano is known for. My favorite is Take Me Home which seams to me heavy with atmosphere. The musicianship is good and the vocals are subtly beautiful."
2,Where is the real Concrete Blonde,"Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this album. The entire project seems so uneven. The songs are average at best. There are no standout cuts. Being a huge fan, I of course had to purchase it. This album is definitely for the fans only. Come on guys, try taking a little more time on the next album. This album sounds like a mess."
2,Middle Age Spread,"Concrete Blonde's Group Therapy is the aural equivalent of middle age spread. There are excellent songs here, especially ""True, Part III"", ""Valentine"", and ""Inside/Outside"", and a few real clinkers (""Violent"", ""Fried""), but the entire thing could use toning and tightening. Average song length pushes the five-minute mark, with little melodic or thematic development. Johnette Napolitano, in fine mettle, is easier to take since she has nothing to prove. Still, there's weariness in this CD, and the sad realization that it takes twice as long to end up in the same damn place."
1,Totaly Lost Their Edge,"Why did they even bother. Theyve totaly lost it.If you listen to the album enough times, you will understand it. But now matter how many times you listen to it, you won't find any genius under there. A girl I know played Still In Hollywood, the album, last year and I fell in love with it and its still one of my favorite albums. Then I bought their other albums and wasnt that impressed, mostly because it was a little dated when I heard it. It just didnt have that edge, that rough but precise feel of Still In Hollywood. Way too produced. And this album is even worse. Like another reviewer stated, nothing stands out. Sounds very uninspired and REALLY lacks the emotion they used to have. Well what do you expect when you stop for years, and get old. Yep, theyve gotten old."
3,Fond Memories,"I wanted to see this movie as an adult because it was one I had enjoyed so much as a child. John Lund's slapstick performance as Skyler Tatlock stood out for me back then. Now I appreciate the performances of Barry Fitzgerald and Monty Woolley. It has the feel and appeal of The Man Who Came to Dinner or Holiday (with Carry Grant). The sad thing is the poor quality of this 1948 B&W film. I bought it for my video library and will watch it again, however, it is only available on VHS and is one of the films that really needs to be cleaned up and re-released. Unfortunately, important films are probably in line before it."
3,Boring,"This is absolutely their worst album.Some of the songs are decent..likewhen girls telephone boys, good morning beautiful, pins and needles and hexagram, but the rest is just blah and pretty much boring. If some of the songs that I like werent on here I seriously would only give it 2 stars.Deftones got better with each album and just went downhill with this one. Adrenaline was good, around the fur was great and white pony was excellent.Ive also noticed that chino is using some computer on his screaming. or whatever the dj guy mixes his scream. I dunno if chino is losing his voice or what.Hopefully their next release will be good."
3,Don't Follow The White Pony...,"The 4th Deftones album would be amazing.. if it was made by almost anyone but the deftones. Since it was made by the deftones, and it followed White Pony, its a tad bit disapointing. Some of the songs pretty dull, and don't feel like they'll be memorable after a while. I don't think there are any 100% bad songs, but no classics either. I'm defnitly not giving up on em! They already have another album in the works and i bet it will blow this away!"
1,total crap,"this is one of the worst albums ever by any nu metal band,man what a let down,anyone who thinks this is a good album has their head u their bum,get white pony adrenaline and around the fur,but forget this dud it is below mediocre"
4,...in with the new,"Got this cd a couple of days before it was released, after seeing the video for ""Minerva."" On a whole, a good album. Takes elements from Around the Fur and White Pony and finds a comfortable in-between. Highlights: Battleaxe, Needles and Pins, Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event, Deathblow, Minerva. Low points: Hexagram, When Girls Telephone Boys."
2,What Happened?,"Being a Deftones fan from way back, and understanding that their musical style has been transforming into something more ""melodic"", I was nervous about buying this album. Turns out I was right. This album is a continuation of their attempt to develop Chino's voice into something melodic...which is not possible, it seems. The first two albums' vocals capitalized on their angst and energy, keys to their early success. White Pony began the downhill slide, with Chino's vocals beginning to become dragged out. The music on this album is great, as usual, but the vocals aren't working for me...your mileage may vary. Bring back the old style."
5,Best Deftones album,"Sorry to all those White Pony Bandwagon fans, but this is their best of them all.Self titled > Sat Night Wrist > Around the Fur > Adrenaline > White Pony > Diamond EyesThey're all fantastic though, in their own way. None of their albums sounds like the others. eagerly waiting on their 7th album late this year!"
2,By far the deftones worst album,"I have been a dedicated deftones fan for years and could not believe how washed up and tired this new album is. How the deftones could have done so much with their previous albums and then just dropped this bomb is beyond me.All the tracks are strict B material and have very little to offer in terms of engaging a listener. It just a barrage of menontenous trashing and wailing that is enough to make a fan who has treasured their unique and innovative spin on metal cry.But I will try not to get misty eyed and just say that some may be able to find some enjoyment in its purity of noise, but I find it pure crap. I've tried giving it an honest chance 7 times or so now and each time have to struggle to make myself keep listening."
2,Another highly anticipated release....,"sadly, falls flat on its face. I've been waiting for another ""Around the Fur"", but I guess my wait continues. Imagine all of the different strengths of all of the great Deftones albums, mixed together but completely without drive or energy. The songs are just uninteresting. The poor production doesn't help either. The whole ""primal"" feel is cool, as long as you can make songs that accentuate it, which the Deftones didn't. There are three good songs on the album, and the rest all sounds too messy and similar to really enjoy. Bloody Cape, Battle Axe and the brilliant Deathblow are all amazing, and Chino shines through out. But don't believe the hype for this one. Its just really not that good."
4,As expected.,"This album will definitely show that the Deftones are as versitial as they want to be. From hexogram to moana it just held me in awe that i could not believe that a band with such force in their music can do it in a whole album while the music being way more ""experimental"" to us because we didn't know that the deftones were ""that sort of band"". Again i think people have underestimated them and i believe this album is a point to show that they can make hard music & moody tracks meld them together in a excellent album. When i picked this album out i picked it because it was the Deftones but listening to it, and looking at the booklet(with full color) it showed me that the Deftones were reflecting their lives through this album somehow. And just that feeling & acknowledgement gives you a window to chino,abe,chi,stephen,& franks journey as a band & their growth."
4,different,"They still have the ""emo"" in them but there is something missing. Anyways its still an awesom Cd but it cant beat white pony nor adrenaline... Very very good"
3,"Decent follow up to ""White Pony""","I had started listening to the Deftones before nu-metal became the next big thing, and I had considered ""Around the Fur"" and ""White Pony"" the band's best albums. This self titled follow up to ""White Pony"" finds the band taking on a darker texture to their music a la ""Adrenaline"" while mixing it in with their more melodic style a la ""White Pony"", however ""Deftones"" really doesn't offer anything new or groundbreaking that the bad hasn't allready done. ""Needles & Pins"", ""Minerva"", ""Deathblow"", and ""Bloody Cape"" are solid tracks, but ""Lucky You"" (also featured on The Matrix Reloaded soundtrack) sounds way too much like filler material. The band as a whole sounds like they haven't progressed as much as they really have on this recording, and as a whole ""Deftones"" just feels rushed. All in all, I'd take the Deftones over the heap of whining nu-metal and melodic post grunge music of today any day, but this album is nowhere as good as it could and should have been."
2,very lacking,"before i start id just like to say i have never felt the need to write a review fo anyalbum before, but this i felt did. this album well, so say it bluntly, lacks alot for deftones i feelthe songs are structued similiarly, or perhaps played like pony, but just seem to be all over the place. dont get me wrong, the lyrics and meanings behind the songs are still there, just the way they truend out wasnt the best. from being a big deftones fan, i would recomendto buy this album on the cheap.. or... get it by other means. white pony was the peak of them trying new stuff, i feel thats where it stopped."
3,New Deftones fails to deliver,"The new deftones album 'Deftones' hasn't delivered on the hype that surrounded it. Musically this album is powerful with hints of Around the Fur in the powerful guitar lines and heavy drumming. However lyrically the album is a let down. Chino has not reached his potential on this album. He puts in a luckluster effort which cannot backup the powerful guitar lines. Personal favourites include Battleaxe, Minerva and Moana. The enhanced feature on the cd is not very good. It includes video of all of the band members but fails to compete with the video footage off the Back to School single recently released.A dissappointing and luckluster effort from the guys this time around."
5,A Gem in the Rough,"With all the copy-cat bands in the heavy-alternative/metal arena these days, it's such a relief to hear something like The Deftones! They consistently put out unique and intricate music, and this new album only adds to that. After the lushness of 'White Pony,' I was nervous that this new album would push The Deftones to an over-produced sound, but that didn't happen. Instead, the band raised the bar (and the energy!) and worked out an album filled with powerful--sometimes primal--pieces. Lots of screaming abounds, recalling earlier 'Adrenaline' and 'Around the Fur' days. It's harsh at times in a way that makes you feel great to be alive and in the middle of such creative genius. Even the lightest song on the album, the brilliant post-shoegazer single ""Minerva,"" has a strength that few metal anthems can hold up against. This album was definitely worth the wait and is highly recommended!"
3,dissapointing,"This cd is ok, but thats not good enough for a deftones cd. Anniversary of an uninteresting event is the worst song i have ever heard, why in the world are some of you supposed deftones fans praising that song?? Adrenaline is still the best cd by the deftones and since this album as been released, I have actually gotten a new appriciation for the white pony."
3,Disappointing Mystery,"I was extremely excited to read a Harvard-set mystery featuring an academic sleuth who is both African-American and female. Unfortunately, the mystery (plot, surprises, credibility) is the most flawed aspect of this book, which reads more like a romance novel. I have no doubt that the author knows the territory (she is a graduate of Harvard-Radcliffe), but she has a lot to learn about writing and literature. Too many stereotypes, self-conscious ""reversals"" of stereotypes... BUT despite what I consider fatal flaws (I'd really rate it at 2 1/2 stars), it's an enjoyable read if you don't mind the Race Relations 101 sociology and the Intro to Feminism yadda-yadda. And isn't it a little odd that every single male at Harvard finds the heroine irresistible? Not nearly dark or well-crafted enough for my taste. However, since I went to graduate school at Yale, I'm going to try BLUE BLOOD, the second in her Ivy League series."
3,The history more interesting than the human interest,"I found the excellently-researched background of Easter Island and its mysterious statues more interesting than the human element in this story. Like another reader stated, it left me wanting to know more.Of the two female protagonists, I felt the most for Elsa, who loved a man she couldn't have while married to a man she didn't love in order to secure a stable home for her autistic sister, though I found Greer more likeable and engaging.I'm afraid for the most part the book was over my head, as it got a little too heavyhanded with detail, and I wish the author had given more time to the unfortunate German captain and his crew that figure in the story as well."
3,Too long but ties up well,"I found parts of this novel to be too long winded and quite dull, especially the pollen/scientific descriptions. There were also parts that were very engaging. I alternated between wanting to sit reading for hours, and thinking ""Why am I reading this?"" Some of the events described were too coincidental and unlikely. Those things felt forced to me. I did, however, like how Elsa's story finished - the two stories were woven well together where they overlapped in time - and the ending saved the book for me."
5,Easy to travel with,My 5 year old loves this item. We can pick it up and take it anywhere in this handy little backpack. Much easier than the ziplock bags to keep each cartridge and book togeather lol.
4,Please help!,"I am DYING to get my hands on a song that I have been tol FOW sings. It's called ""Today's Teardrops"" and is very country feeling with acoustic guitar and such...PLEASE email me if you know of it, or where I can get it... please, I'm desperate!"
4,wish i had listened to this sooner,"Let me just say I wish I had discovered Fountains of Wayne sooner. They're a really great band. I can't remember them being very popular when this album came out but heard their name being thrown around a lot later.This album was described in Wikipedia as a concept album, centered around teenage youth living in suburbia in the late 90s, 2000s. It sounds like it got thrown to the side and not many people remember it. I think it perfectly captures all the emotions and drama of going through high school. Sports, parties, camping, relationships, getting your first car, the girl next door, getting in trouble etc.Now being in college i wish i had this, because it reminds of the good times (and the bad) in high school. this all sounds cliche and corny but its nice to listen to a whole album that takes you back to a certain time and place that was worth remembering"
3,fun groovy lyrics,"Very different from their Debut Album. More folksy and groovy songs are in this album. I think the artists are trying to make more social comentary here. Every song in Utopia Parkway is good, but only on one or two are really radio worthy. Don't get me wrong I got my money's worth and was entertained. Some of the songs like Red Dragon Tatoo reminded me of the chase scene music from old 70's cartoons like Scooby Doo. I bought this on the strength of their first album but I would not have bought their first album if I had heard this one first."
4,This is just marvelous feel good stuff....,"Utopia Parkway is one of those records where you can hear a snippet of just about everything that went before. .... For me, I hear first wave British Invasion tunes from the likes of Donovan, the Zombies, and even Herman's Hermits. Couple those musical roots with inspired lyrical turns of phrase and you have a very winsome combination. The music and lyrics are nostalgic and on a few occasions seem to veer a little too far into sentimentality. However, if that is the worst of its faults, you can call Utopia Parkway a very good recording indeed."
4,"A few disposables, otherwise transcendent moments.","Every year a few records come out that I know will define the year for me when I look back as an old man. This one crept up on me and has become my cause celebre. Okay, I'm a pop sucker which apparently is a small percentage of music fans these days. What's up with kids? I miss the simple problems and optimism that drenched the gloom and testosterone of my teen years ( You know the feeling. ) but I listened to Cheap Trick. I don't get Limp Bizkit or whatever...bet then my dad didn't get Cheap Trick. ""Troubled Times"" is just essential. I've listened to it probably 50 times and I'm a 35 year old with a life. Thank God for these guys, The Hang Ups, The Red House Painters and others that just NAIL it despite radio's ignorance."
3,Not really the best,"I found this book to be in the middle of realistic and not realistic enough. The plot was about Gail, a young woman (still in high school) who is already sexually active. In the beginning she is being stalked she doesn't really have any idea who it is and thus can't protect herself. She decides to babysit for a neighbor and gets raped by her stalker who is really her ""best"" friends boyfriend. I found that this book just touches on the surface. Gail jumps out as being eerily real, but the people she meets are all one demensional. If I had a choice to read this book again, I probably wouldn't. If it couldn't keep my attention the first time, I doubt it will a second read through."
1,Don't read it,"I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one."
4,My Favorite Martian was a really fun and clean family movie.,"I saw the movie on my plane flight to South carolina, and it had me laughing out loud, and my dad and step-mom were laughing and they didn't even have the headphones on. I definitely can't wait until it comes out on video!! It is a great family film, and i wish there were more like it."
4,good movie,"I seen parts of this movie on starz. So, thought I had to have it. None of the video stores seemed to have it, so I ordered it off Amazon.. It came as promised, no problems...."
4,Cute remake of a old series.....,"The movie is cute but nothihg like the series was, LOVED the series. Shipping was good."
1,My favorite martian...,A stupid movie that could have been something worth watching. First there is a bit of nudity in the first 20 minutes and the rest of the dialogue is lacking for what is suppose to be childrens/family movie. Disney missed it with this one.
2,"Average, boring stuff!","I remember I went to see this in theatres when it first came out. As I was walking into the theatres I saw a large billboard on the wall advertising this film. Scralled across it was the word ""Poop"" in large white letters. And I agree. This movie is poop."
3,What more can I say?!?!?!??!?!?!,"I had to put a review on this one. I grew up listening to these kats and still like them today. No this isn't a classic album compared to some of era that it came from and the other artists that were around (KRS, Rakim, Big daddy kane, etc). But it is still a fun album with decent beats adn some ok lyrics. Now we all know that Milk is Mc lyte's cousin. So I pose this question. Knowing that this is not a superior album, would these kats have made it without MC lyte's help? I would probably say no. But I am glad lyte did get them in the game for the brief time period they had. My favorite joint on the album is definitely top billin'."
3,good effects with some minor flaws,"if you can really pass of some of the cornyness of this movie it really pays off big time... Seann William Scott is a hoot as always and its a treat to see him getting his groove on with Jaime King(James King, also a model) and Chow Yun-Fat is phat in this movie as the man who trains Scott to be the new protecter of the scroll...very good action but like I said it only goes so far to be so good....some what of a corny title..but hey.....theres a lot more corny titles of movies out there then this...fun for its time"
1,Bulletproof monk,Bulletproof monk was terrible it had some what good action scenes in it the storyline was horrilble the actors were hardly acting some funny parts in the movie I would give it 1 star
3,bulletproof junk?,"This is not the worst movie, but it's not very good either. I'm somewhat biased. I miss the double gun handling Fat movies. I wish he would return as some kind of ""killer"". Yet, even if he wants to pursue martial arts movies, he certainly shouldn't be doing it in a silly ""Jackie Chan"" style movie. I've always agreed with people comparing him to a modern day chinese Cary Grant. He has too much class for something like this, and I believe it's a step in the wrong direction. You may be a big Fat fan(as I am), and have to see his movies no matter what. If so, wait for it to hit the ... theater, or your local video store. In this way, you'll appreciate the money you've spent a little more."
4,Loved Victoria Smurfit's Nina Character,"By the end of ""Bulletproof Monk"", the ancient Tibetan secrets that are supposed to be its focus are less interesting than an acting-for-the-camera mystery.How can an unknown Irish television actress (Victoria Smurfit), who looks like a pre-implant Patsy Kensit and whose supporting part is relatively small, flat-out steal the movie from the the actors with the four bigger parts?A related question would be how Smurfit, wearing loose fitting pantsuits, can come across about seven times sexier than former spokesmodel Jaime King? Actually King's character is pretty sexy, but when Smurfit appears midway into the film you forget all about King.Impressive performance Victoria, you elevate an ordinary formula movie-your scenes alone make it worth watching.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
4,Bulletproof Monk,"I feel this 'martial arts' film is better than the average of it's genre; there's a plot that makes sense, it's got enough action, a little love story, a 'morals' type message and no need to be dubbed. Good cast."
3,For history,Goes through many couples and their struggles throughout the decades of the twentieth century. It is o.k.
4,A must-read about Russian/American romance and marriage.,"I'd like to thank Lynn for writing this book. I feel strongly that anyone, especially American men, should read Wedded Strangers before committing themselves to a cross-cultural marriage. The pains you save may be your own! Lynn's chapter, ""The Mindset"", towards the end of the book, I thought especially well-done. Perhaps now is the time for a rigorous, statistical study of the Russian/American marriages that have taken place this decade. Such a study would be a welcome follow-up to the historical and anecdotal work Lynn Visson has given us in Wedded Strangers."
3,But......,"I don't know exactly if this book is good for learners of neuroanatomy or not. But in my opinion, its content and ways of description are too complicated for a beginner to learn. Therefore, as a beginner of neuroanatomy also, I don't recommend beginners to buy this book for study. By the way, does anyone want to recommend a better textbook of neuroanatomy to me? Please tell me as soon as possible."
1,Not suitable as a wall phone,The display is fixed and angled down which makes it impossible to read when wall-mounted unless you are less than 4 foot tall.The voice mail indicator is an icon on the LCD display and can not be viewed from accross the room. Most phones with this feature have a light that eluminated so you don't have to get within 1 foot of the phone to see if you have a message.This phone didn't come with a short wall-mount cord. I used one from an old phone.I have always been pleased with Panasonic procducts up until now. I plan to get a different phone and put this phone in a spare room where I don't have to use it.
1,Major Disappointment - Broke on 2nd Use,"I do NOT recommend buying this Hammock. I bought it for my son who weighs just 145lbs (it's suppose to hold up to 300lbs) and it broke the second time he used it. We are now past the 30-day return period, but I am hoping Amazon will come through and refund the entire amount of purchase."
1,Hammock review,This product was very disappointing. The rack construction is not very good. The rack collapsed the first time in use with about 1/2 of the weight limit requirements on it. Returning for refund.
1,Fabric Ripped After Slight Use,"This product was a gift that we gave. After three months of LIGHT use, we attended a party where this hammock was used. Someone laid in it and the fabric ripped and sent the user to the ground. After inspection it appears as though it was the fabric stitching pulling and then finally tearing. Very embarrassing as I thought I purchased a half-way decent hammock.This is a low quality hammock which I don't think anyone would find a use for as the quality is so too low. The life of the hammock after light use is about a few months."
1,Unable to set up; hammock did not fit support structure,"Was delighted to receive this hammock as a Christmas Gift. However, we were unable to set it up. We followed the directions (starting setup over several times in case we missed some small detail.) Went online and viewed Kelysus video on set up as well. Each time was the same result. The hammock could not connect between the two attachment points. Measured the hammock -- seemed to be appropriate for the description. Made the assumption that the manufacturer used wrong parts for the support structure that resulted in the support structure being too long.Return to Amazon was easy with a quick refund."
2,"Kelsyus XL hammock - trouble setting it up, not very comfy","I bought at Costco due to attractive price. I am pretty handy but I could not stretch the hammock enough to connect to the hooks on either end. I then took the arc supports out of the hammock to see if then it would stretch but then not only did it not stretch enough from end to end but I could not get the arc support back in their pockets.I ended up cutting 1"" off each arc support and am now quite satisfied...plus I used an extra S hook on hand to make the hammock more comfy.Not enough time on it yet to make an evaluation on comfort and durability."
3,good,"Good quality sound! Worthwhile because the production is very good, songs range from mediocre to good"
1,they've really hit their low this time........,"the last album was pretty crappy. I think they tried to re-create an ""adult"" sounding album, ala Behaviour, but missed. The best song from the last album (Sexy Northerner) was not even on that album (it was a b-side), and here is extended and completely stripped of vocals. What's the point? This chumbo remixer sure got a deal off of that song. The other remix ""Here"" is good, but after repeat listening, actually sounds too generic and inferior to other mixes. I can't see what the big deal about ""London"" is either, seeing as how there are two versions, one practically instrumental, the other a slow piano version. As for the other songs, they're just crap really.....They basically released crap versions of ""Behaviour"" (on Release)and ""Relentless"" (on Disco3). Go for those two albums, leave this one at the store!"
5,"FINALLY A WORTHY FOLLOW-UP TO ""VERY""!!!","This is without a doubt the best album the Pet Shop Boys have released since 1993's ""Very"". The songs are upbeat and every one is dance-floor ready. But the big selling point is that they have released an album appropriately enough in the midst of the 80's electro-clash revival - but it's not new for them - this is the music they've always done until recently with ho-hum releases like ""Bilingual"", ""Nightlife"", and ""Release"". This is a fad that the Pet Shop Boys started themselves, and it sounds just as good now as it did in the 80's, if not better. In my opinion, the best track on the album is ""Somebody Elses Business"". It's nice to have ""Positive Role Model"" on a CD finally, as it has become something of a new cult favorite among a lot of dance clubs. Basically, this is THE DEFINITIVE Pet Shop Boys album and is a pure joy to listen to."
3,The book may be O.K.. But;,"Unfortunately, the copy I received has a moldy smell which makes it unpleasant to read, so I have only started it. The part I have read reads like a little girl gushing about her lovely parents."
5,"Good, and to the point","I lived in the Hawaiian Islands for several years and was aware of a lot of the history and issues. This book really gets to the core of the important things quickly without much elaboration, and is very readable. It would be great reading for anyone planning to go there even for vacation - doesn't take long to read and hits all the important stuff. Doesn't gloss over the controversial issues."
3,short and sweet,"I was reading, again, the novel Hawaii and this book simultaneusly. They both gave me a wonderful feeling for the island and its history. This short history was easy reading, fast reading and it covered the main aspects of the area that I visited and fell in love with."
3,Not recomended for 20 GA.,"It does fit and work on a 20 GAUGE,but it's pretty loose. It fits just fineon my 12 GA."
4,Duane Eddy and Santo and Johnny,"Duane Eddy is seond only to Santo and Johnny.Both artists instrumental geniuses..perform w/ their heart and soul..unlike others, who merely go through the motions...you hear that Ventures?..you use to be ' the one '..guess you just got tired."
2,NOT THE ORIGINALS!!!,GOOD SOUND..BUT THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE RE-MAKES OF THE ORIGINAL HITS.NOT BAD...BUT I LIKE THE ORIGINAL . AT LEAST ADVERTISE THAT IT IS A RE-MAKE.
3,Pretty good,this film is pretty good.Paul Hogan was cool&Laidback thru out.it's Lighthearted but it works like a charm.very basic but it had wide appeal.
3,Country mouse-city mouse parody,"This is a run-of-the-mill man-out-of-his-element comedy. Paul Hogan is the outback croc poacher who comes to NYC, where life is REALLY dangerous and weird, and has all kinds of adventures with muggers, prostitutes, the subway, etc. Lots of slapstick, visual comedy. It made zillions of dollars at the box office, as you might expect, but there is nothing exceptional about the movie."
3,the original non child endangering croc man,"the story is that this chick goes to the outback and hears a story about a local guy who killed a croc with but a knife.she goes to do a story on him.shes a reporter.she hangs with him for a few days and finds out hes never left the outback,never been to a big city and hangs out with ruffians and aboriginees his whole life.so she takes him to ny with her.he runs into much trouble.the kids like it.its about as good as the second one.his ol lady is 80s hot but into days world she would need much work.his movie lightning jack is not as good .its alright."
4,Funnneeeee!,"It's old (1986) and it's schmaltzy and old-fashioned, but Crocodile Dundee is still worth watching if you missed it first time around. Paul Hogan, fresh from Down Under, is so perfectly cast that it quickly becomes apparent that he's not really acting at all: this is just who he is. He plays a relaxed Aussie tracker who shows an American reporter around his native bush country, then accompanies her to her own turf in New York City. It's the old fish-out-of-water theme, and Hogan and co-star Linda Koslowski (whom he later married, in real life), play it off perfectly.Pure confection, but also pure fun."
1,Dumped my Bass,"Might be better for guitar, but after leaving my bass on it for 10 minutes or so, it tipped and dumped my bass on the floorIt's simply not balanced well enough."
1,GARBAGE DISHED OUT BY IDIOT,"IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES FOR ANYONE WHO SERVED WITH THE 173D AIRBORNE IN A COMBAT ROLE TO REALIZE THIS BOOK IS TRASH WRITTEN BY A POSER. WHILE HE MAY HAVE SERVED WITH THE UNIT HE IS STILL A POSER, ACTUALLY MORE DAMAGING THAN SOMEONE PRETENDING TO TO HAVE SERVED. HE DESERVES TO BE OUTED AS THE FAKE HE IS. THAT IS MY OPINION."
4,"Awesome Idea, Bad Tecnology.","In this game, you are Stevie, Lisa, or Carole. You are staying at a farm where you: take care of your horse, ride around, practice jumping, and try to solve a mystery.I loved this game, but it was very slow. Then I lost it. But I want to buy it again, it was such a great game.I reccomend this game to someone who likes horses, and has a fast computer."
5,A must read for coping with everyday life. Inspirational!,"Not only does Wemp hit on the bullseye exactly what is lacking in our society today, but he backs it up with personal experiences and scripture, evident of God's work in his life and through this book."
2,Film Music vol.2,I am very disappointed with the music selections and actual music itself. I have only listened to the CD a couple of times hoping my first impression was wrong. It wasn't and I will most probably give the CD to someone.
5,The Matrix Soundtrack Rocks! Just like the movie!,"What a brilliant compilation. Can't understand why it didn't win a Brit award this year.I absolutely love the use of it in the movie, especially during the club scene when 'Dragula' morphs into 'Mindfields'.Great stuff!"
3,"Not great, but a good sampler of techno","This isn't the best stuff I've heard, but it was EXCELLENT when I first bought it :) it inspired my search for Techno... the best out there that I've found is Meat Beat Manifesto. U can't go wrong with them..."
4,"The sound track had good music, but the music was too old.","The Matrix shound track was great. It had many good bands with different types of music, but itdidn't have enough new music. I did like all the band and all the songs, but I still have to give it 3.5 stars."
4,A Great Mix of Music 4 your Ears,"I think this CD Album rocks, it brings together metal and dance songs and the end result is a very powerful album that suits the mood of the film. Best album i've got in a long time, Apart from Du HAST, yeah DU Hast (dont ask?). By the way, you have to see the film as it kicks butt, film of the year / 5 years for definate."
4,THE MATRIX KICKS @SS!!!,"I loved the movie (saw it three times) and the soundtrack is pretty good. There is one song that I really like but have no idea who the person is. It is track #4 and called ""clubbed to death"" by Rob D. I looked around for this artist but he does not seem to have anything else out there. I really loved this song and it was worth the 13 bucks alone. If anyone knows who the heck Rob D is, PLEASE e-mail me. Thanks."
5,A aural bag of mind candy on a saturday night !,"I really enjoyed the ride. Fortunate enough to see it at Manns Chinese in Hollywood made it an event as well. This is the type of soundtrack that film makers lust after, sleek weapons, black leather, martial arts and a sound that inspires you to see it put in cinematic motion. To all the fans that saw this and connected, I am shooting a short film about a group of dead special operations soldiers returned to commit angelic revenge. Looking for this type of sound for ""Angels Blood"". Something fast, pumping with a complicated techno beat would be perfect. If it has any angelic background noise thats a plus. Help me with my score I will get you a copy of the completed product. We need more like the Matrix. Start here!"
4,Well,"First of all: Whoever said that Rob D wrote all the music for ""Clubbed to death"" is incorrect, it is actually based on the 1st of elgar's enigma variations. The most famous enigma variation is Nimrod. This is a different variation, and my favourite one actually, and I'd recognise it anywhere. The strings at the beginning sound like they are directly sampled, and the piano bits are just an arrangement of the strings. That's not to say it isn't well done. That, and the propellorhead's track are highlights. They make me come over all matrixy and want to run up walls.There's a definite unmistakable sound here, and it's part of what makes the film seem so stylish."
4,welcome to the real world,"The soundtrack for the matrix is filled with techno beats and rock.If you loved the movie there is no doubt that you would like the music that helped give it it's vibe.The music is for any fan of rock or techno.The beats and sounds that were made for this sdtrk helped shape the feeling of the movie.Any fans of such groups as marilyn manson,deftones,prodigy and rage against the machine will find that this sdtrk belongs in there collection.Personally having bought this back in 1999 I have to say that it never really gets old.Overall I would say this is a good album especially the songs by Manson,Rage,and rammstein.Everything sounds good and I would say it's better then alot of the sdtrks out there.There are 13 tracks and a run time of about an hour overall this is a must buy for any music fan."
2,Simply disappointed,"If there were some way to remove all the words from the music this would be a killer Soundtrack, but lets face it listening to the stuff makes you wonder if your going to wig out and turn into some kind of anarchist. Probably the most disappointing thing about the CD is the fact that they left out the song that Neo is listening to when Trinity first contacts him. It was a Technology flick and they didn't even add any goodies for the PC user. I am simply disappointed!"
5,This Cd Rules,"This cd rules. Not only the movie kicks a**. But so does this awsome cd. Any rock fan will love this cd, i do. It simply kicks a**"
2,The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture,"Alright, so the movie was great. If the movie was your inspiration for wanting this CD/tape, then you've been mislead. The music itself is somewhat interesting. Half of the music would sound a lot better when you're watching the movie. My recommendation: forget about it!"
1,"Great headset, but they break!","I loved these headsets when I first bought them. Yes, they're big and ugly, but I've tried many other types and have never gotten such perfect sound quality.After I bought mine, about 15 other people in my office joined in and bought one, too. Then they started breaking -- all in the same exact spot where you can adjust the headband. Already, four are broken just four months later. I wonder how many more will break after I write this.So sorry, great product, but it doesn't matter much if it breaks."
3,Try to get your hands on some of his other recordings!,"Though this album features some of Jan's more interesting Jazz experiments, like Bird Island and Valdez (he really should have tried more of those), really his best work is on albums like ""Eli"" (with Kaz Lux), ""Puccini's Cafe"", ""Focus in Time"". A superb live overview is the double CD ""10.000 clowns on a rainy day"""
1,not really worth it.,"Horrible pillow. It's curved in the middle, so you have to squish your back into it. It is also so much smaller than the picture; so it doesn't even support your entire back. Plus, the company will charge you for all shipping fees (including the amount they shipped to you in the first place) if you are returning it. That plus a 30% restocking fee made it not worthwhile to return it. Totally bad purchase."
3,"Good Movie, Just Not A ""Saint"" Flick","If the title and main character were named anything other than ""The Saint,"" you'd have a great action movie. However, in regard to the modern day Robin Hood character created by authour Leslie Charteris (who is not mentioned ANYWHERE in the credits AT ALL.....) in the late 1920's, the only ""Saintly"" tie-ins are: Roger Moore's voice-over at the end of the film (the original TV Saint), A Volvo coupe (although not white), the trademark stickman pin, and Orbital's update of the Saint Theme. Everything else, right down to The Saint's origins, have little to do with the character. I did like the movie, but after reading so many of the stories, I prefer the RKO films of the 30's / 40's and the TV series with Roger Moore (re-issued on DVD and VHS) as a closer comparison to The Saint character. A good flick, just not the Saint....."
2,By any other name,"I just wrote a scathing review of the ""I Spy"" movie, grouping it with the worst of the television-to-big-screen productions. Among those I included ""The Saint"" and realized that I hadn't warned the unwary about this movie. Tom Keogh's review describes the problem with this movie perfectly. It might be an OK espionage movie but it's a miserable treatment of Simon Templar, as anyone would know who is familiar with Leslie Charteris' knight errant. Where Val Kilmer uses goofy disguises to accomplish his task, Simon Templar would brazenly face the villian with the dare to thwart his imminent undoing. George Sanders and Roger Moore were superior as Simon Templar and enjoyed the benefit of superior writers if not Leslie Charteris, himself. Sadly, who ever sold the rights to this property was only seeing the dollar signs. Simon Templar should have paid them a visit."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have never seen one of Val Kilmer's movie's before.But I sure have since then.He is an excellent actor and there seemed to be real chemistry between him and Elizabeth Shue.So far I have watched it 8 times and plan on watching it many more.The action keeps you on your toes wondering what will come next,and the romance is really sweet."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"Not a classic but well worth watching over again.I had forgotten the whole jist of the story.Thoroughly amused by all of the disguisesElizabeth Shue was most excellent -Val kept you guessing [not like the JACKEL, with Bruce Willis but still good]Great addition to the collection of memorable characters."
3,Nothing too Special...,I got real tired of this song real fast. This song is nothing special both lyric wise and melody wise. I would advise against buying the single. I give the song 2.5 stars-- there are better things to spend your money on.
1,Unsuitable as a self-teaching guide,"This book contains several errors. It is unsuitable as a refresher and COMPLETELY unsuitable as a self-teaching guide. I suggest ""Trigonometry Refresher"" by A. Albert Klaf."
5,Great parenting tips made easy!,"As a psychologist I see many busy families in my practice who are looking for simple to read, easy to follow, and impactful parenting tools to use in their homes. This book has it all! Parenting is a full time job in the midst of a hectic life-style. This book brings practicality and lightness to a topic that everyone with children can use. I encourage parents to buy this book and impliment the wonderful loving tools Dr. Melanie offers. A great book for grandparents and step-families as well."
1,Check CD immediatly,"I bought several Beatle CDs to complete my collection. Unfortunately I was traveling when they arrived and so did not open the order until after the return by date. All the other CDs were fine but the ""Help"" album is defective and will not work on several of my CD drives. If you order this CD open and check it immediately or you're out of luck."
3,Works...but,"My exhaust gas temperatures exceeded the O2 sensor rating under heavy load, so I decided to purchase this heat sink. The product has a hole in the side of the cylinder that extends into the exhaust. This hole must be facing the exhaust port when installed. There is an index mark on the ""nut"" to accomplish this. The problem is: What do you do if the index mark doesn't line up correctly after installation? No shims were provided to achieve proper alignmnet. One thick brass washer was provided. Forget your local hardware store for metric shims. I ordered aircraft copper crush washers from a website that recommended them for their 18 mm spark plugs for antique Harleys. Replacing the existing washer with one crush washer did the trick.The product works as a heat sink and I found no affect on AFR readings, with or without the heat sink installed. If it wasn't for the installation problem, I would have rated it higher."
4,Good dark electro music,"The first time I heard this CD, it reminded me a bit of older Clan Of Xymox. This CD has good song writing, good vocals, and a dark feel without being too dark."
4,A Hell of a Tale,"This is the way to tell a story! I felt like I was there, was really grabbed by this one. This book graces the otherwise limp, fluffy fantasy/sci-fi shelves."
1,Unprofessional production,"Learn to breathe! It's very, very important.I achieve much relaxation when i Stop. Concentrate. Breathe Deeply. Learning how is important, too.But this set of tapes is poorly done.The first tape is sales, WHY you should learn to breathe,and what the benefits are. I already have the tape, i'm sold.Please stop selling.The second tape is laughable. The author fills the tape with minutes of dead space as we 'breathe together'. The author will say ""Here's a breathing exercise. Let's try it."" The explanation of how to do the exercise takes 1 minute. Then, there is 2 minutes of silence.This happens quite often. The 2nd side of the 2nd tape has 5 minutes of new-age flute music, to get you in the mood.For me, this book didn't work."
4,"12"" World Globe","This was purchased for my 4 year old grandson who keeps wanting to play with his father's ""very good and expensive"" globe. Anyway, gave it to the boy for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. He's learning where he lives in the US and where other family members live or visit."
2,Flimsy - Made out of reinforced cardboard,"This is a beautiful globe with all the educational properties you need, but if you are looking for something to last a long time, I would pass on this one. The glove is made out of reinforced cardboard, and the base is light plastic. Mine came very quickly, but was split apart at the equator (where they put it together in manufacturing), so I had to send it back. I wish they made it better."
2,Flimsy!,"Got this because of the good reviews and cheap price. It's a great globe, but the stand is extremely flimsy. You can't pick it up without it feeling like it is going to fall apart. In fact, simply by bending the holder a little bit the globe will come right out of it. I guess I'm just used to the globes we had growing up that had metal stands. This one has a plastic one that I'm not impressed with."
2,Light-weight base,"I purchase two of these as gifts, each for a home that had children. I was disappointed that the base was plastic and light. When children spin the one we have, older but with a sturdy base, it stays where it is. I was envisioning this one sliding all over. Too bad, 'cause it was otherwise nicely made.PS I returned them."
4,Great service!!!,"The service was great! However, the picture illustrates a harris D814 or Siemons 814 Impact tool. The Fluke Networks D814 is actually a differnt color and the picture does not reflect that. The tool works fine, however those in the industry know and trust the signature siemons/Harris 814 by its color(s) The fluke version is Fluke colors."
5,This is a good headset,"This is an excellent and comfortable headset at a very good price. I have had mine for a very long time and has never failed me. The sound quality surprised me for such a cheap headset. It has a noice-cancelling mic too. If you are looking for headset to fit a 2.5mm jack, this is the one. Cord length is very good too. The headband is very sturdy and it is highly unlikely that it will break unless you sit on it!"
1,More of the Same,"This is the sort of negligible and pedestrian collection that gets published as the result of the writer's entering a competition and having his or her submission adjudged to be better than the other contest entries. In most cases, the winning entry gives the reader a sense of how god-awful the other entries must have been. The Drew Heinz Prize has a long history of duds and dogs, and this collection is another. It's not that it's outright terrible; it's just that it's a collection of formulaic workshop-style exercises. The prose is uniformly drab. The plots are mechanical. The characters are pale echoes of people you've read about, too often, elsewhere. Prizes like the Drew Heinz are ensuring the increasing marginalization of serious literary writing."
5,I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG!!!!,"I HEARD THIS SONG A FEW MONTHS BACK ON A STATION OUT OF DALLAS, TX ON THE NET. I JUST FOUND OUT WHO DOES IT AND I THINK THEY ARE GONNA GO FAR! REALLY GOOD COUNTRY AND ALTERNATIVE COUNTRY MIX. THEY NEED MORE EXPOSURE!!"
4,Smart case solves the problem of too many little plastic cases,"I am not a professional photographer, though I do take photographs as part of my work as a field researcher. And I take a lot of photographs, which means a handful of 1GB CF cards floating around in my bag. Those little clear plastic cases are tedious to use and just as likely to get lost as the cards themselves. This case was something of a miracle in that somebody seemed to have gotten it right.And it is almost entirely right. The one place where the case errs is that the hard rubber could actually be a little softer. First, it would make it easier to snap the cards in and pop them out, and it would, even if only in my imagination, cushion the cards should the case endure a fall.$20 is about the upper end for what I would pay for such an item, but having paid it and having used the case, I am happy with it."
2,very 80s,This album has a very 80s sound with a touch of freestyle. It's ok but not too great. Just one more 80s album....
4,Cd Is Fly,He mixes phat beats and lyrics in a verbose line of songs. He uses his talents and his friends such as Ja Rule to mix some fly beats.
1,Not what I was expecting,"When I got these headphones I was hoping for clarity and at least some range of volume within the headphones, but the sound is somewhat muted and I have to wiggle the jack where it connects to the DS in order to get sound in both ear pieces. It could be just something with my DS, but I don't think so.Also, I got the primarily so I could do the vocal testing in Brain Age 2, but it still cannot pick up my voice. The mike does work with Brain Age 1, so it could just be that game.I'm going to try the Nintendo bran next. If that fail, I'll just use my mp3 headphones and just don't worry about the Brain Age vocal tests.Let down."
3,Pretty but doesn't work all that well,"I only use them to hear the game out of it. The mic feature of it does not work properly. The games I have that you need to use it for whatever reason cannot understand me clearly. Once I remove the headset and try again it works just fine. I still say it is worth the money however, especially if you want a headset simply for your DS."
1,A few problems,"A few problems with the device. It took a long time to get in and once it did it was the wrong one. Not sure if that is a problem with the picture, or what. As far as the performance of this model, it is too small and does not fit properly on the lumbar region of the spine. The twist ties are sown on with very thin material, and in about 2 weeks it rips.It does come with a cover for the roll which is a positive.The crinkles that the night roll makes when it is bent push into the sides of the stomach and hurt after about 20 minutes.Overall I am severely disappointing in the device and its performance. I wish there was a way to warrant it with a 0 star.There are better products out there, just take 3 minutes to look and find something else.-Very sad purchaser."
3,Somewhat effective but uncomfortable,This product does help maintain the arch in the back but I was hoping for a comfortable fit and it is not. Hard to sleep with it on. It is not contoured to fit well.
3,Not easy to install but responsive return,"The hitch was not at all easy to install. In fact, I had to return it to Amazon the first time because the holes did not match up and then the second one was very difficult to get bolted on. Nevertheless, it looks wonderful and I've been using it ever since."
5,Outstanding performance and value!,"I got the V770 to replace an aging Creative TNT video card with 8mb of video memory. The Diamond card blew my mind with its performance! Using my slower, Celeron-based system, the Diamond V770 cranked out very impressive frame rates in Falcon 4.0, which is my mainstay in computer gaming. A superb card, very simple installation, and a great price make this a perfect card for someone wanting performance without extra features found in some other, more expensive cards. Outstanding!"
5,great,"It isn't the glen cambell album I was looking for, but, it had most of the songs my husband and his family grew up on. They were very happy and so was I."
2,Universal Remote Control,"The Philips PM4S 4 device Universal Remote Control is a nice looking remote. It is easy to program with one drawback. The list of devices is somewhat extensive. It is easy to connect with different devices once they are programed.The one disadvantage that I have found is that some television sets are not in the programing instructions, and the auto program feature does not work well with the unlisted set I had. I was not able to program that tv into the remote control. I would have to think twice before recommending tis item to others."
1,hugely disappointing,"This film was quite possibly the worst film i have seen this year. I normally love tim burtons films but it just shows blockbusters isn't really his strong point. The cast for start was badly ensembled. Walberg was far too wooden, tim roth was just plain annoying and carter put on the worst ape impression i have ever seen.On the dvd, there is about 13hrs of extras but i havent even watched 1 minute of these due to the fact that the film was so bad. Stay away from this film."
2,Monkey Business,"A bland, generic, corporate-motivated PG-13 near-dud of a movie. I never saw the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, but it had to be infinitely better than this mess. The DVD, from what I understand, is a well-assembled package, but a mediocre movie is still a mediocre movie. Proceed with caution."
1,Wrong Director + Poor Script = Bad Movie,"When it was announced that Tim Burton would be directing the new Planet of the Apes movie, I cringed. To me, Burton is goth (i.e. Beetlejuice, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands). Putting Burton at the helm of a classic sci-fi/adventure film was wrong. His directing style is painfully incongruent with what fans expected from a new Apes film. This dud of a movie is the byproduct of that terrible Fox decision.Tim Burton aside, the other major problem with this movie is its script. The story is confusing, rushed as well as predictable. With twenty-some years since the release of the final Planet of the Apes movie, you'd think someone could have written a great script. Instead, we get another ""dumb down the audience"" McMovie complete with a large breasted female character.Skip this one. It's only a renter. Instead, buy the 1968 classic of Planet of the Apes. A much better film which I have never tired of viewing over the years."
2,Watch the original instead,"This movie was predictable. The ending was predictable. Why redo a classic with all of the bombs that could be redone/reworked. If you love the original, don't waste your time with this one. This movie is proof that expensive special effects wont make a classic movie better."
4,APPLES AND ORANGES,"FOR ALL OF YOU OUT THERE THAT SEEM TO THINK THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOOOOOO BAD, YOU NEED TO STOP COMPARING IT TO THE ORIGINAL. IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL; IT IS NOT A REMAKE. SO SHUT UP ALREADY ABOUT THIS ""IT AIN'T AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL"" SH#T. THE MOVIE IS FINE IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON IT'S OWN MERITS AND STOP COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES."
2,Tim Burton's Folly,"While it is often a mistake to compare remakes to the original film, I will gloss over the mediocrity of Mark Wahlberg's performance and focus on what concerns me most. When this film was made, Charlton Heston, who gives an outstanding but unbilled performance as a dying simian patriach, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. In short, he was a man dying from a terrible, degenerative illness. To cast him as a dying man was both egregiously cruel and insensitive. Shame on Tim Burton!"
1,Bad. Really really bad.,This movie isn't worth the time to even bother writing a detailed review. I had to turn it off after the first 45 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. No redeeming qualities to mention. Just stupid. I'm really disapointed because I usually like Tim Burton movies and think Mark Wahlberg has been good as well.Bottom line - you've already wasted enough of your time reading this review. Don't waste anymore by watching the movie.
1,worst movie of the year,"Firstly, it's not fair to compare or contast this film agains the 1968 Heston film. New story, new characters. That said, this movie is a horrible, vomitous mass whose only saving graces are outstanding makeup effects and the best on-screen villain since Darth Maul. Mark Wahlberg can't act his way out of a paper bag. Burton, I fear, will lose Hollywood credibility for this snoozer, even though he's a tremendous visionary. Certainly, the dropped early Schwarzenegger/Stone treatment of this sounds more appealing."
1,no reason for this movie to exist,"Take everything that made the original good (arguments against war, religion, military, corrupt political system), now flush that all down the toilet. Add some boring CGI special effects and sexy Hollywood hunk. Now make the whole film about thinly-veiled racism (speciesism). Slice that as thin as you possibly can, because Americans are a lot dumber now and can only hold 1 major theme in their mind at any moment. Finally, end the thing with a lame time-paradox (which never even remotely gets explained, therefore it makes no sense by definition).The original film had an iconic ending....the Statue of Liberty buried. It was a grand anti-war, anti-nuke statement. Tim Burton must of missed the point of all that...Maybe his hair was in his eyes during that scene..."
1,Ugh...,"Absolute crap. Avoid it at all costs or be prepared to ask for your money back. What was Tim Burton thinking? Couldn't get Johnny Depp for this one? Marky Mark is about the worst substitute he could get for Chuck Heston's part (or anyone's part, really. Hope you can read this, M.M.). And the ending makes a nod at the original novel (that no one has read but me and T.B., apparently...) but makes not a damned bit of sense. There's a reason that the DVD is selling for .99 at CDNOW, beware..."
1,I resent having spent two hours of my life watching this,"This is the worst movie I've seen in years. Even with the ""big-screen spectacle"" I was bored. A lot of movies you can say ""It was bad, but at least it was entertaining for a couple hours"". Not this one, just boring. I would have walked out had it not been a group trip."
1,Really Baad,"Just awful. Undeveloped and fractured characters abound. Loose ends everywhere. Embarrasing Charleton Heston cameo (gives away a GUN). A chimp (a real one) steals the final scene. A tacked-on cliff-hanger ending to make up for the poopy real one. Kris Kristofferson! The only saving grace is the lovely Nova-... character, who gets plenty of camera time. Mark Whalberg does his best, but he's a little better than this. Try him in Boogie Nights. I'm not comparing this to the original, it's apples and oranges. There is no sweep or spectacle in this, it's all very stagey and wooden, and predictable. OK, Helena Bonham Carter is good, but she's behind that chimp make-up, and her character is also marginalised by the end. Embarrasing."
1,Let's just pile on here,"...Within a couple of minutes the hero is already speaking perfect English with apes. Maybe they were all wearing some kind of translation device they forgot to tell us about. Massive holes in the plot to the point of absurdity. What was with the villian ape in the end, did he just go nuts and become harmless or something? I guess not by the ""surprise"" ending, but how lame. Why didn't they just animate this? It would have been cheaper."
1,This is just plain bad,"Too Violent, Too depressing, Too ridiculous. What a mess. Why did they do this movie. I cannot imagine. The writers should never be allowed to make another movie. THey took a perfectly interesting tale of scifi/fantasy and made it a violent almost unwatchable mess. Shame on the populist director for making this drek. The worst part is, that is made a ton of money in the theaters which will cause them all to probably make another one. Maybe it will not be as grotuesque. I must admit though that the ape makeup was awesome."
1,Missed the entire point of the original film.,"I loved in the original Planet of the Apes how Taylor was a misanthrope, he hated humanity, yet on this world he is the one who must defend it. Brilliant.This film totally lost the plot. I wish I could give it a Zero rating. They should have let Arnold and Cameron remake it."
1,"Good features, Stinky movie","Let me say this: based on supplemental features alone, this is probably a 4 star DVD. There are many documentaries and such, though I must say Tim Burton is very annoying on the commentary track. He seems to go on and on without really saying anything insightful.The movie is a mess. If you're familiar with the original film (it's hard not to compare the two), you know what an impact the ending has on the whole movie. By trying to match that shocker ending, this new version COMPLETELY NEGATES the ENTIRE film that built up to it. I defy anyone to actually make sense of it. Not even Tim Burton could! Sure, he said it made perfect sense to him-- but he didn't want to explain it for fear it would foul up Fox's plans for a sequel.This is a completely disposable blockbuster. Watch or re-watch the original, or even it's sequels, before wasting time and/or money with this."
1,worst movie of the millenium,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a very very long time. Both the plot and the acting are very shallow. Marky Mark cannot act, and his acting is so bad as to be distracting. Estella Warren is barely in the movie, only a superficial role, really. The movie is nothing like the original.At first I thought it was pretty cool to see a cameo of Charlton Heston as an ape, until I realized he was just using the role to spew his NRA philosophy that guns are what make us the greatest. So, what if you forget the plot and the acting, what about action? The action plain and simple stinks as well. Two of the head apes fight each other for what I thought would be a good fight scene, and poof it's over. Boring. The two endings are just ridiculous, especially the last one. I would pay people not to see this movie and any sequels, for their own good. This movie gives a bad name to scifi, Hollywood, and the original planet of the apes."
2,Not Worth the Money,I went to the movies to see the Planet of Apes just to see what the hype was all about. Well after sitting their and enduring the whole movie I was totally disgusted with the ending. How in the world did he go back to the past only to find the apes had taken over? And when he kissed the ape chick that was totally nasty....ewwww Mark Whalberg!!!!If you like Sci-fi then you might consider this movie...if you don't then SAVE THE MONEY!!!
2,Only APES the original,"Why monkey around with a good thing?! This version is big on special effects and make up, but sadly lacking in plot & character. Stick with the original instead of catering to this second banana!"
1,My Play3 can't detect Planet of the Apes [Blu-ray] disc,3 star for movie0 star for blu-ray disc because my play3 can't play it.
2,extremely disappointing,"This is my first review of a movie here, prompted by some of the reviews I read for this remake of a classic original. I watched with great anticipation for a technically enhanced or even superior Planet of the Apes. Wow what a disappointment. Storyline was really bad, makeup special affects were not all they could be ,such as the female ape characters, but others were well done. A missed opportunity for Mr Burton. Maybe I hoped for too much."
2,Great special effects... NO CLOSURE!!!,"COME ON!!! This is a PRETTY good story with REALLY good specail effects. BUT THERE'S NO CLOSURE!!! When I watch a film I want closure. Is that too much to ask? I don't mind a little bit of an open end which could POSSIBLY lead to a sequel, but, for the LUVVAGOD, let's don't end a film with the OBVIOUS plans of a sequel. Uhhh if there's no sequel planned then... well, that just makes the movie that much worse, doesn't it.This film has no ending. When the film stops rolling I was sitting there saying to my wife... Is there another cd?No Chaz. That's all there was... You picked it.All that aside, if you don't care about closure, if a complete story means nothing to you, and your whole movie-watching life revolves around action and good special effects, then yeah, this movie was a renter. Sorry, but I can't bring myself to buy it."
1,Tim Burton should be ashamed for letting this get released.,"This is a movie that relied solely on special effects and makeup for its success. Strip these away and what is left is a bad action movie with two dimensional characters (one woman in the movie is so poorly developed I would say she was one dimensional, I couldn't figure out why she was there other than to look good), horrendous dialogue, and an ending that just came out of left field for me..."
1,Monkey don't see; monkey don't do.,"This movie was so bad that my wife left half way through and my friend and I looked at each other afterward with apish grins wondering why she was so much smarter than we were. We should have aped her and left before we spent any more time monkeying around.There was no character development and no character motivation. The makeup was great; the wire work was bad. The physics of the movie was absurd. I was particularly amused by how bad the crash landing on the Lincoln memorial was and how he just popped right out of the pod afterward, fresh as a daisy.If you were planning to see this, I don't mean to throw a monkey wrench into your plans, but skip it and read the book instead."
3,Ape Lincoln,"Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just run of the mill science fiction filmmaking. The story and character development is very minimal. Since we have all become such sophisticated filmgoers over the years, the denouement is predictable and is somewhat just unimpressive. Mark Wahlberg as astronaut Davidson is convincing and likeable. Tim Roth as the brutal adversarial ape Thade is convincing and dislikeable. The real culprits here are uninspired Tim Burton's direction and a very bland script by Mark Rosenthal, Lawrence Konner and William Broyles Jr. Composer Danny Elfman's score is nondescript. One standout element is Philippe Rousselot's artistically alluring yet gritty cinematography."
5,Every human MUST read this -,"This book compares human and animal slavery in a way you can never ever forget. The words and pictures are unforgettable. You will feel the feelings of those humans and those animals who are used (and being used now) as slaves.Read this book, and change your life! (it really helps) Many thanks to Amazon.com for recommending this book to me..."
5,An excellent resource for drama teams,"The sketches in Planting Seeds confront the audience head-on with tough issues such as envy, adultery, materialism and finding purpose in life. Lamkin is able to communicate biblical truth on these topics in a way that is relevant, thought-provoking, witty, and, at times, humorous -- without being condescending or preachy. The ideas, characters and dialog are woven together in a way that allows the audience to become absorbed in the drama and to really feel it, instead of passively watching it. These sketches are chock full of creativity. My favorite is the humorous ""Just Look at Yourself"" which addresses the issue of materialism and discontent by having a large-screen television accidently delivered back in time to a caveman."
5,Powerfully written dramas that open hearts,"I have directed several of these dramas as sermon starters at my church. They have invariably hit the mark, sometimes with laughter (""Look at That!"") and sometimes by hitting a nerve that causes a painful silent response (""Unsinkable""). The author has a knack for seeing us as we are and translating that into short, powerful drama moments. The power of drama to capture an audience's attention cannot be overstated, and these dramas do just that."
1,THEY ALSO SERVE...,"I have nothing to add to the other one-star reviews of this bad movie, except perhaps to emphasize the incomplete and inadequate ending, but I found it interesting that, if you watch the credits to the end, you get some idea of the kind of help a wealthy man gets when making a movie. For in the credits (which seem to include most of the population of Bucharest), you can learn the names of (1) ""Mr. Seagal's Stunt Double"", (2) ""Mr. Seagal's Photo Double"", (3) the provider of the ""Wardrobe for Mr. Seagal"", (4) ""Mr. Seagal's Make-Up Artist"", (5) the ""Executive Assistant to Mr. Seagal"", and (6) the ""Driver of Mr. Seagal's Trailer"".Further, you can even learn the provider of ""Mr. Seagal's Trailer"" (Translux International Ltd.).The mystery is that, among all the members of Mr. Seagal's entourage, we are not told who is ""Mr. Seagal's Voice"". At least I didn't see that.A bit more work along these lines and Mr. Seagal may discover how to make a film with no personal presence at all."
1,attack force should be shot down!,"I am a major segal fan but I can honestly say this was a total waste of film. segal has a voice over for more than half of his limited dialogue, the story is absolutely ludicrous and the special effects are awful. the only thing I can think of he is just needed the money or something. I threw the movie away. It is one of THE WORST movies I have ever seen!!!!"
3,"Has its moments, but ""Martinis..."" is much better","I discovered Sam Phillips via ""Martinis and Bikinis"", a simply marvelous album. I've seen her live and she's a quirky, edgy, brilliant performer, with an odd, dry, tongue-in-cheek deadpan delivery that is her unique style.I also liked Omnipop, the followup to Martinis and Bikinis. I picked this one up later. My general sense is that the songwriting is less strong here. It certainly has its moments, but this one has never gotten under my skin, colored my dreams, and lived in my CD platter like ""Martinis..."" has. I'd say ""Omnipop"" also exceeds this albuum.A fine first effort, but she got much better.Rock on,SB"
1,This antiquated card as a gold box???,"Amazon has the audacity to hawk this as a ""gold box"" bargain for [money amount]on 01/29/03. This was a good graphics chip in 1998. Worth about [money amount]today for a basic system. Since this card, we've seen the TNT Ultra, then the Geforce, Geforce DDR, Geforce 2, Geforce 3, Geforce 4 and now Geforce 5 subsequent generations of cards. Bottom line? It's grossly inadequate for any newer games.Let the buyer beware!!"
1,Slow Going,"This grinder is clumsy to use and took me 30 minutes to grind enough beans for a double espresso. It wobbles about and the handle bangs your hand with each revolution. If you were at the top of a mountain, it might be worthwhile, otherwise forget it."
1,Horible card,"This is one product that we need a ""0 Stars"" optinon on how do you rate this product, its absulutly horible. I got it to replace my VooDoo3 2000, thinking it would be better with more video ram, no, it was flickery, and slow, my desktop had lines all over it and i couldnt even run games. Do not buy this card, get a Geforce 2 or some VooDoo."
2,What a disappointment after Friendship Cake.,"This book really fell flat. Lynne Hinton's first book Friendship Cake what such a good read. I was sincerely disappointed in her second work. She had a good beginning, but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant, and a little dull. There was some hope of a good plot, but something was definitly missing. Try again Lynne, you have talent. Maybe try a sequel to Friendship Cake. The characters that you developed in that book are really good."
3,I think this needed to be a bit more developed!!!!,"""The Things I..."" was a pretty decent read. I do feel, however that the character development was not very thorough!!!! I did enjoy Tessa and Liddy...I just wish I knew a bit more about them."
5,"Excellent, one of my all time favorites. Nice compilation.","My kids grew up with this CD, it was nice to be able to find a copy that they could add to their own Christmas collection."
3,Plot Change? Blame the Reagans!,"Many reviewers of this movie comment its lack of faithfulness to the plot of the book. For example, the teenagers in the novel are all using drugs and having meaningless sex. The only person with a drug problem in the film, however, is Downey Jr.'s character, while the rest of the cast (Gertz and McCarthy) try to save him while they fall in love. As far as I can see, this is a direct result of Reagan's ""just say no"" anti-drug and pro-family campaigns of the 1980's. The film makers were making a piece that reflected the political climate --- they weren't necessarily interested in staying true to the plot of the novel (which, by the way, isn't necessary for a good film adaptation - but that's another discussion)."
5,From riches to depravity,"I could not believe the reflection which this movie cast upon the eighties generation of the youthful wealthy. It was full of rich and detailed scenes of unleashed gratifaction in which the wealthy enjoy. The movie also explores a very dark, and somber experience of the young fallen financially elite. I see that the movie shows us the atrocities of what a heavy drug user will do for a ""fix"". In all I have to say this movie will relate to most all generations, save the eighties jargon."
2,Shock value?,"Less Than Zero was a film I've heard people say was powerful, meangingful, and deeply moving so I decided to watch it one evening. I was less than impressed with this ""drug"" film, Robert Downey Jr., is over the top and Jami Gertz well who said she could act? The only performance worth a damn is Andrew McCarthy, he actually cares about his snobby, heartless friends, I always thought McCarthy was highly under-rated. This film goes absolutely nowhere, it's mudane, tries to be glamourous, and it's boring to look at. If you want a real and profound film about the ugly and dangerous world of drugs, I would check out Requiem for a Dream. Stay away from this uninspired mess!"
5,Great Movie,"So my mother, who was in high school when this movie came out, decided to purchase this movie for me. I have to say that I think Robert Downey got a little help from the drug addiction he already had, but his acting is still amazing. Yes it's a low budget cheap 80's film, but isn't that what made the 80's so great? I will admit that at the end of the movie I cried. Breakfast Club is of course going to be number one in my book, however this is a close second of mine."
2,Read the book instead!!!,"I finished reading ""Less than Zero"" by Bret Easton Ellis a few months ago (which I really enjoyed) and thought I'd check out the movie. What a disappointment! Other than both being about rich kids in L.A., the movie is much more shallow than the book and doesn't follow the same plot."
3,fair,"ginger baker,s new cd coward of the county is ok,but not as hard drivin as middlepassage, wich realy rock,s with havey drum beating,i hardly recormand middlepassage."
1,biased and poorly written,"poorly written, and clearly biased. I was extremely disappointed in the book."
1,Give Me a Break!,"Hella Winston had a lot of fun trying to understand Orthodox Judiasm. Unfortunately, she decided to write only negative aspects. If you want to understand Judiasm, Hella Winston, sign up for Aish Hatorah (aish.com)!"
5,Shame on Amazon,"for allowing people to post ""reviews"" that are no more than right wing Orthodox propaganda. I have actually read this book and see no merit in the claims of ""Mark"" below, nor the review he links to. This book very openly states that it is about rebels, not the Hasidic world as a whole, but I do wonder whether these reviewers protest just a little too much. After all, if this hadn't hit a nerve I don't think they would be reacting with such vehemance. The fact is that the book tells some very compelling stories about what it's like for people who were born into a fudamentalist way of life, but who no longer believe in it or want to live that way. Even though it is about Hasidic Jews, there are so many parallels with other fundamentalist groups, many people will be able to relate to the strories of these people."
3,Not as NRBQ as I'd hoped,"While there were a few songs I really liked, many were kind of ho hum. Think I'll look for a 'greatest hits'."
4,Bring it out on DVD !!!!,"This is a super movie that has a great plot,great actorsand tons of intrigue.With a cast as terrific as this,Ican't understand why it hasn't made it to dvd.Especiallywhen some of the worst CR*P in the world is now on dvd.If you want this movie on dvd then please click on yeswhen asked if this review was helpful."
1,not recomended,"i purchased this product because of what others have placed in their reviews and for 16.00 i guess that was a good price to pay to know not to purchase this item ever again, the static is horendous. that all you hear static"
4,What's a title anyway?,I liked the speed of shipment as well as the portability of the transmitter. That was the purpose of purchase in the first place. Thanx!!!
5,Very nice,The beauty is in its simplicity. My three year old in two days could 'read' the lines and he took it into preschool this week as his favorite book.
2,this is something to consider,"high trust = community organization &/or national loyaltymid trust = clan, extended family, or sub-caste = the radius of loyaltylow trust = nuclear family being the radius of trustThe wider the circle of trust and loyalty the more people can cooperate and the more people can cooperate the more they can accomplish. And, this thinking could (or maybe should) led to the conclusion that if all people had high levels of trust for humanity in general along with fierce loyalty to all humanity, we would probably be flying to the next star system by now.Unfortunately, instead of realizing we are all human beings (nature allows any of us to have healthy children together), we are too busy trying to oppress one another and trying to prove that those people are inferior and trying to figure out how to exterminate the other."
5,"Mana simplemente ""The Best""","Hola mi nombre es Juan y como puedes ver soy uno mas de los fanaticos del fabuloso grupo MANA. Para mi su ultimo disco Mtv Unplugged es uno de los mejores discos que e escuchado en estos ultimos dias y como pueden checar las canciones nuevas no nuevas pero cantadas en ese genero si lo son, yo pienso que esas canciones son bien compuestas al genero de rock/pop y especialmente MANA el number one in USA in rock, es como un relampago fuerte el nuevo disco porque hiso gritar a todos y cantar sus canciones. Yo me despido en caso de que alguien lea mi opinion acerca de MANA escribeme un e-mail a juanruelas@juno.com"
5,Must Have,"I had never heard any of Mana's music before(I live in WI & there are no Spanish music stations here; I know, it's a bummer). I bought this CD after listening to Santana's latest. My favorite song on that CD is ""Corazon Espinado"" w/Fher on vocals. I figured I should expand my musical collection to include not just salsa, merengue, and hip hop. I put it in my car & wanted to take the long way home. It has been the best ""let's see if this is any good"" CD I've ever gotten. Since then I've gotten their ""Mana Live"" & ""Donde Jugaran Los Niños?"" They're all good, but I have to agree that this one is great. Add this to your collection a.s.a.p.. You don't even need to know Spanish. You'll enjoy it no matter what language you speak."
2,LE FALTA MAS ROCK!!!,"ESTE CD ESTA MUY POBRE DE MUSICA ROCK-CONTIENE MUCHOS COVERS, POR FALTA DE TALENTO, Y CREATIVIDAD, NO ES DE ROCK, ES DE TROPIROCK- JA! JA! JA! MANA NO SOBREVIVIRA MAS!!!"
1,"No cigar, not even close","The format, on a computer disk, was an exciting presentation for me, BUT, on the pages where the exercises were outlined, where the lines were presented on which to do your exercise, the program had a read-only, no-write restriction. Not to be daunted, I printed the book to paper so I could do the exercises. Too bad, paragraphs overlapped paragraphs, lines of type printed on top of other lines of type. I never determined if the book/disc was at all useful in content, because the format was so very useless. Better luck next time."
1,"Mediocre book with bad, non-erotic stories","My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste your money."
2,It Leaks,It was a very slow leak and I wasn't even able to determine where it was coming from. But things still got pretty wet underneath. Sent back for refund. I'll stick to the Brita pitchers I guess.
2,Leaking,"I bought the Brita and love the taste, however we had a leak where the spout it. I guess the seal shrinks when it is in the cold and causes a leak. I returned one after owning it for a week and then the replacement started leaking after two weeks. I wouldn't want another one."
3,"Needs redesign, Tip for disassembling to clean","I just melted my third Ultramax dispenser in the bottom rack of the dishwasher, so I'm shopping for a new one. I'm glad so many people have complained about the poor design, perhaps some day it will make a difference when they finally come up with a new model. Until then, here is my tip for easy removal of the the reservoir: Wrap a loop of fishing line around the white upper reservoir before you place it in the lower part. I wrapped it twice for extra strength, and tie the ends tightly. When you want to remove the upper part, simply lift up on the loop of fishing line and it pulls right out. The line is thin enough not to interfere with the fit of the lid. I wipe the line with 10% Clorox each time I clean the unit and replace the filter. They could easily fix this problem by texturizing the sides of the white upper reservoir. I'll try that next..."
3,"Can be difficult to fill, some leaking","I own a previous model that was just like this except without the electronic reminder. I keep mine in the fridge. It can be a pain to fill, and the water is susceptible to fridge odors since the cap is vented. I've noticed minor leaking from the spout's connection to the housing, and I'm keeping my eye on it. Had it for a year and a half. A couple of times when I've cleaned it (as I do every two months at filter replacement) I have noticed possible mildew/mold/suspicious-looking pink stuff."
2,Not so great a deal...,"Initially, the product worked great. Bought it for our small office because I was tired of drinking pool water. After the first filter was replaced, tho, I started noticing problems. Funny taste to the water within days of replacing the filter; I noticed some of the water wasn't draining into the tank, but sitting up top fermenting (I guess). I started wiping it out with a paper towel soaked in vinegar. I guess if I did this every day, it wouldn't be a problem, but what a pain! Even propping it up doesn't seem to help. It has to be the design that is causing the problem. We live in a dry climate (NM) and the water was being used up regularly so mold shouldn't have been an issue.My PUR pitcher doesn't have that problem. I'm probably going to pitch this one and buy a PUR pitcher for the office. Sad, considering the cost."
5,love it!,"I LOVE having a lot of cold water in my refrigerator whenever. Unlike the smaller britas, you do not need to fill up nearly as often, so it is always cold!"
2,The Brita 18 cup...ANNOYING....,"My husband and I just bought it thinking that it would be nice to have one that contains more water. Though when we opened it the reservoir didn't come out NOR were there ANY handle or instructions on how to pull it out. The 8 oz was better designed and works great!! Not this 18 cup one it is VERY frustrating and a WASTE of money in my opinion. We are very disappointed in the design of it and that the company didn't have any instructions on how to get it out as well as WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? Seriously, there should have been a way to get the reservoir out..."
3,What is there in item when ordered NOT actually coming to you,"I have ordered BRITA WATER Filter system (with dispenser), when I gave the order the timer was there in the item.BUT when I got it delivered they provided a paper kind of timer by which I have to take care when I need to change the Filter in the dispencer. I need it any how that is why NOT returned back. and always thinking the returning shipping cost associated with it. means you incurr shipping cost out of nothing for U."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I really have enjoyed using this product. It was a lot smaller then I had expected so it doesn't take up all that much room in the fridge. I use a pitcher to fill it up and it is quick and easy. Very pleased and it was exactly what I wanted. Would recommend it to anyone who drinks more then a pitcher of water a day, because of the volume it holds."
3,"Convenient, BUT mold, leaking, and hard to clean","i like that it's a large container and convenient as far as having clean water always available. however, much like many people, i've experienced mold issues, leaking frequently, and most frustrating in my opinion - the fact that it is near impossible to easily clean. the design of the product is pretty ridiculous and it definitely makes you wonder if they tested it before putting it on the market. doubtful...otherwise they would have realized there's no way to easily remove the filter holder part from the actual container. makes it pretty challenging to thoroughly clean. after googling how to clean my brita ultramax, i came across a helpful but negative review of the product and this person suggested to fill the entire container then tip the unit upside down and allow the pressure and weight of the water to push the filter out. this luckily worked and i was able to clean it. but honestly i'm a bit disappointed it's so poorly designed."
1,Bad Quality.,"Product was leaking and I had 3 sent back and forth. I finally found a functional one at Bed, Bath, & Beyond.Sorry we couldn't do business with this product.Jason"
1,WRONG ITEM!!,THE ITEM SHOWN IN THE PICTURES IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I ACTUALLY RECEIVED! THIS HAPPENED TWICE!!! i ordered this Brita filter and as u can see they advertised a this unit coming with a small screen to monitor the condition of the filter and notify u when its ready to be changed. i received the same filter but without this screen. i asked for a replacement and its still the wrong one.
1,I hate this dispenser!,The Brita Ultramax has leaked all over our refrigerator for the last time! I bought the dispenser and then replaced it when the first one started leaking within a week. The second one has begun to leak a couple of months out. How can Brita sell this kind of rubbish and keep their reputation?
5,great product,"just trying to get away from plastic bottles. We also have to bleach our well on a regular basis, so this dispenser is perfect."
3,"close ,but no cigar","Multiply by 10, no 20 times what LL describes in ""Gutted,"" then you can you may begin to comprehend the true meaning of ""gutted.""A must read for anyone considering buying a fixer-upper. My advice, buy a house already gutted, renovated, and move in ready."
5,inspirational,"My Psychology teacher presented my class with this book, and I can't tell you how glad I am that she did! Despite being tragic this is a story that we all benifit from hearing it. I just had the chance to meet the author and it was possible a life changing expirence."
1,"""Postcards for the Holidays""","I could not agree more with the 2 ""negative"" reviews I saw. I would not have 90% of these cards in my album if I had gotten them for FREE! ""Personal taste"" aside, to show cards in such poor condition is mind-blowing, especially in a book whose cover promises much more. I'm a very recent collector of Holiday postcards, so I've been buying every reference book I could find. ""POSTMARKED YESTERYEAR"" by Pamela Apkarian-Russell is a wonderful book. Joe Hohmann, Madia, PA"
2,"Hurl, then whirl","2 1/2If not for the third and final track in another short full length, the disc's dated dichotomy of electronic invigoration and pop desperation would have been busted beyond repair."
5,Organizational Psychology Professor,"This book is inspirational and helpful to doctoral students (probably master's level students too), and to instructors teaching qualitative methods. What I find most helpful about it is that it honors the subjectivity of qualitative methods. It is a feminist approach that begins with the self as knower, not an easy transition for those trained in the positivist tradition. Furthermore, Margot Ely involves her students in the writing of the book, demonstrating the peer relationships she establishes with learners and the possibilities for collaborative learning among adults. It is a great book full of ideas and reassurance. It s not a step-by-step guide to a particular approach or method. Rather, it is a guide to experiencing fully being a qualitative researcher and the level of engagement and transformation researchers should expect from the undertaking. I highly recommend this book for both new and more experienced people teaching qualitative methods."
3,Decent flavor....,"Not quite as ""mushroomy"" as I was hoping for, but the subtle flavor is definitely there."
4,"Basic, but helpful","This book is great for teens between the ages of 15 to 18, or for those who are still in highschool. It gives great advice on how to save money and the basics of investing. I'm 19 and this book was a bit helpful but told me most things which I already knew about, like how not to fall into credit debt etc."
1,WRONG,"I ordered this item cause it says it will fit my 2000 Dodge Durango SLT, but I received it all excited, and it don't fit,It should be more specific on what it fits cause it don't fit my vehicle but it says direct fit, bull crap."
4,Not Neil Gaiman but a Lot of Fun!,"It's really more of a 3.5 stars but I rounded up. I, too, read about this book on Neil Gaiman's website and I wasn't sure what to expect. What I found was a quick and quirky read about Scottish fairies who wind up in New York. Morag and Heather the two main fairies who hail from the ""old country"" and wind up displaced but making the best of things in a crowded city in the 20th century. They find Italian, Black, and Chinese fairies along the way and make friends with two unusual humans. The adventures are happy and silly.It's a fun read with a light tone, in fact, it could be considered ""young adult"" except for the pornography channels the male human likes to watch on television. If you are expecting something deep, forget it, but if you want to laugh out loud and enjoy yourself for a bit, go ahead and get this book."
3,"Silly, but not a bad read.","Not really my normal material but given my mood of late I thought maybe I could use some whimsy and this was recommended. I think it could have been ended better but what it did, I think, it did pretty well. It was fun and very offbeat and I can say I have never read a book before where the main heroine wore a colostomy bag.You aren't going to go to this book for depth or truth but as escapism, I think you will enjoy it. It helps, perhaps, if you are a fan of the New York Dolls."
5,hot mamas,I borrowed this cd from a friend and have kept it for almost a year. It is what I always listen to in my car and at home. Zap Mama's collaboration with The Roots is going to break down barriers in music. It's smooth grooves and soft vocals will put you in a good mood any time you listen to it.
5,Proposal Writing Advice that Works,"The book was recommended to me by a literary agent and after reading through it and using it as an example I can understand why. It's just an excellent book proposal reference.The first part of the book goes through the steps and elements necessary for a book proposal. The descriptions are straight-forward, easy to read and follow, and the ""formulas"" are easy to copy. The second section, as the subtitle says, contains 10 full book proposals, along with margin notes that explain why different elements of the included proposals are good examples to follow.This was the third book proposal writing guide that I read when I was working on my own first book proposal. I liked this one because of the margin notes and the element descriptions. It's just well put together and follows a logical (to me) format. Plus, I sold my very first proposal, so I guess the advice from the Herman's works."
2,My Ancestors,"My ancestors founded the first European colonies in America around the same time as Plymouth colony. This book is outdated but a nice piece of history. It's at a juvenile reading level, but still nice to find at the local library. Present day followers of the pilgrim religion still work at the local public library I go to and they don't mind I check out books on it. They are the founding fathers of America as we know it today, getting Indians down to a minority. People still pay respects to the Revolutionary fathers today. The book is nothing special, but the lifestyle, able to do whatever they want. The worship is called Service of Holy Communion."
2,bo,"coming from a math/physics , obviously non-literary , background i was lookingfor a nice overview of mailer's work.unfortunatley, this is simply a series of conversations in the present ( circa2004) with his much younger son. includes a tremendous amount of anti-republican andpro-democrat harping. even if you agree with him, it seems to wear thing pretty quickly. certainly mr mailer has more important and meaningfulwork to display in a collection.not much meat , or even potatoes, here"
2,hard to read,"While the story is great, it becomes grueling to read an entire novel written in the first person especially when it is broken English. It made me want to stop reading after the first chapter. Otherwise, it is entertaining."
4,Pretty fast and in a good condition.,I did not even know that this item was coming from Argentina. And it was pretty fast too. Condition and packaging are good.Thanks.
2,magnificent voice and performance but................,"why i do not know but babs in perhaps her best performances ever, chose to leave off the act 2 finale the yentl medley, as well as the encore, somewhere... why??????????!!!!!!!!!! she was never in better voice than here at the mgm grand, but she left off what i and i am sure, many other buyers, what was the pinacle of this concert the finale of the yentl medley, and the final encore of somewhere! luckily i have the 2 cd concert and played it after watching this major dissapointment! i thought for sure all would be here and was so let down! otherwise, she is/was in magnificent voice and really tore the house down, but i cannot fathom why she chose to leave the greatest 2 moments off of this cd! it was a steal at $10.49, but i would have spent ten times that amount for just those 2 great moments on this dvd! a major letdown, at least for me!"
3,Not as good as HBO special,"3 stars just because it's Barbra. I taped the HBO special in the 90's and still watch it all the time, I even transferred it to DVD from VHS. But wanted something with digital picture and sound. Even though this is the same basic concert, the HBO special is much better. Probably because it's closing night, they worked out the kinks and polished the act by the end. This version on DVD just comes off as unpolished. The dialogue between the imaginary shrinks isn't as cute or funny as the HBO special. The Mike Meyers ""Linda"" scene was kind of cute but overdone and too long. By all means, get this if you've never seen the concert at all. But I wish HBO would release the HBO special instead. The HBO performance is so much more polished."
5,Barbra The Queen!!!,"Today made my day because I got my DVD before it hit the stores.This DVD is so much better than Timeless it's not fair.Barbra is glamorous as usual and her voice was alot better than Timeless. She looked beautiful and I loved the black gown. I love the song selection and the bonus features are a real treat. I hope that her TV specials come out on DVD real soon. What made the DVD was the skit with Mike Myers as Linda Richman. It was absolutely hilarious and a real joy. Although I gave it five stars,It was annoying to see the camera cut to all the celebrites in the crowd after every song. Who cares about seeing Michael Douglas (...) every five minutes? All in all this is a great DVD and I recommend it to anyone."
5,A sensous gothic thriller,This book is really hot! I never knew the Victorian era could be so wickely exciting.
2,Meh,"The inner bag in the packaging was ripped open, so bones were everywhere upon opening. The inner bag looked like it had been sealed at one time and cleanly cut open. Thought I was buying new bones? Also, I feel the price is a bit high."
4,Good Read,"I like this book because it was not like most of Kings other books in that this one is set back in time, the mideival period. I also like this book because it has a lot of fantasy and midieval elements to it. The book has a lot of good vs. evil and stuff like that, but overall i liked it just because it was a different kind of King novel. There wasnt that much horror and gore but more like a fairy tale about kings and queens."
2,RIP OFF,"I hate to be negative in anything that i say, but this was a rip off. I got this for my little brother last Christmas and got sat on big time by the coast. I think i payed something like 15 dollars plus another maybe 12 or something ridiculous for shipping? I was sort of excited to receive it because my little brother loves the Ben 10 show? Well the action figure is about 4 inches tall and not worth the money i paid. The toy its self is pretty cool i guess but not for that money."
3,Not what I expected at all.,"Sure, it looks cool and everything. It's very long and once you stretch it, it's very useful in a live scenario, but it can sometimes fall off. Maybe it's because of my guitar, but maybe it isn't. Sometimes, when the cable is bent at certain angles the guitar just stops sounding. My guitar sounds fine and works perfectly with any other cable i have tried. Maybe I got a faulty one? Anyway, not what I expected at all."
4,A little smaller than casino buttons but still good,This dealer button is smaller than what I observe in typical casinos. I measured this to be about 1.75 inches in diameter but it is still perfect for home use. The lettering was flush and I observed no defects.
3,Great for listening if in the mood for dozing off,"This CD is far from there best. In my opinion they ran out of ideas and were just making sounds. I mean that's cool to an extent, but it gets kind of boring after a while. I would listen to this if I was reading a book or something that didn't require much thinking."
1,Let me make up my own mind!,"I was very disappointed with this book. It could have been a very interesting story - Lee Harvey Oswald's mother's point of view. However, it was written not too long after President Kennedy was assassinated (1965), and Ms. Stafford obviously still had those events fresh in her mind when she interviewed Mrs. Oswald. Ms. Stafford's opinions of Mrs. Oswald were biased and she failed to allow Mrs. Oswald's point of view to come through. She refused to let the reader have his or her opinion of Mrs. Oswald. This was a total failure, since we may have been able to possibly understand (even a fraction) another side of Lee Harvey Oswald. As far as history is concerned, everyone has a right to his or her side of the story."
1,Whats Up????,I ordered this book on July 17/03. This is Oct 9/03 and it has not been shipped yet?? I have no way to get in touch with Amazon.com(that I know of) Someone please tell me what is going on.........Thank you. Wayne Adamson
3,Easy Reading,"This book is sort of a sequal to ""Red Red Rose"", the story of Val and Elspeth. I enjoyed this book more than ""Red Red Rose"". Jack is a dandy of a man and Annie is a very practical lass from Yorkshire who thinks Jack is too much of a rake to marry. The fact that Annie keeps calling and thinking of Jack as a rake, when he clearly is not, was annoying. Jack was not a rake, just very charming, and Annie's attitute towards his charm was silly. I also wish the book had let us know if Val and Elspeth's baby was indeed a boy to be named after Charlie. Again, the book was easy reading, not great, but enjoyable."
4,Not bad,"Works fine, the battery life isn't the best so you may need to upgrade to a better battery. Playback is great but the only problem I found was in darker areas you need a lot of light for clear playback. It's my first camera so I may need to adjust something somewhere."
3,Motor noise,"Camcorder has good features but the motor noise is quite loud and is captured while recording. Other reviewer had mentioned that turning on the wind filter feature helps and I tried this, but the noise is still audible during playback on the camcorder as well as when transferred to the computer and played back from there."
3,Toaster review,"Product looks nice and seems to be made well. Toasts bagels great. Toast a little disappointed, one side toasts more than the other."
2,"Pink Floyd, Pulse",Wait til October for the band to realise this. This is just a bootleg of the VHS version.
5,It's time again for jazz and poetry night,"This is the best new funk record I have heard since Fishbone's ""Truth and Soul"" and if Angelo (Fishbone) hears this record D.J. Davis (All That) will be looking for a new Sousaphone. The grooves on this record take me back to Maceo Parker with the Rebirth Brass band on ""Southern Exposure"". The bass lines are looping in my head even as I write this (they almost never stop). In short, buy this record - NOW ! And if my review makes no sense to you then buy the other two records mentioned above (or face it man, you ain't from here ;-)"
3,Modest but pleasing,"The question I had was how does this compare to the other pinball movies out there? So I finally rented it. It's like a more stripped-down version ofSpecial When Lit - A Pinball Documentary (Blu-ray), covering some of the same territory and people, but not as ""cinematic"", you might say.There is a kind of trilogy so far of recent pinball movies that I've been recommending.TILT: The Battle to Save Pinball (Two-Disc Set)is still the best, a very absorbing tale of the Pinball 2000 attempt to save Williams, with lots of great stuff on the second DVD as well.Only Interstellar Pinball Lives Foreveris a very strange puppet movie that I really like, definitely not for everyone, but it's obvious that the filmmaker loves pinball and pinball designers. For the third movie, probably get Special When Lit, but you can swap its place with Pinball Passion, depending on which is less expensive, since they are very similar to one another (even though Special is more of a complete movie)."
3,Pin,"""Special When Lit"" is a better doc, however this one is pretty well done. Still, a must see for all pinheads.."
1,Awful book! Deceptive description.,"The book description is very deceptive. The description makes it sound as if the book shows all types of scenery as the Truck travels the U.S. I thought it would be a great book to help my youngster see a bit of America. But beware, most of the pages are ONLY close-ups of the side of the Truck and of road signs. Only 3 or 4 pages show scenery; very disappointing. I thought the book was so awful that I am returning it, paying the postage, and don't care if I lose money on the deal."
3,Nice but not the sorting hat,"This is a well made hat for the price. I worked with Costumes for 3 years at a Spirit Halloween store when i was a teen and I learned the difference in brands and fabric. I can look at most products and tell you it won't last or it is worth the $60. This product IS worth the $18 I paid but the face is non-existent. It is just how the hat folds that makes the face but I have seen a really nice prop hat that held the face stiff so it is always there.... I am sure I can pin this one to stay but I don't believe it will be good enough for our ""sorting"" at our party. If you are crafty then this is worth it but if you are going for authenticity then spend the extra money for a better one."
3,"ehh, it was all right","this book isnt the best to use if you're completely lost in calc and hoping to cram it at the last minute. i had a really good teacher for calc so did not have to rely on a prep book too much, but still i found this book helpful in just doing practice problems. for 2007, the practice frq they provide you in this book are nothing like the ones on the actual test. but i'd have to agree that this book is on the easy side, so beware."
5,Particular Passions,Particular Passions: Talks with Women Who Have Shaped Our TimesI purchased this book in 2009 and have found it to be an invaluable source of information about many women whom I admire. I applaud Lynn Gilbert for creating this delightful collection of short biographies.
3,Nada que ver con la misma version en ingles,"Esta version en ambos idiomas es muy pobre, le faltan muchas recetas y fotografias en comparacion con el original en ingles y hasta tiene partes que se les olvido traducir. Muy limitado"
1,Songs of Inspiration/I Believe,"I love this albumn. I have written a book for my family and his songs,voice, are perfect for my project."
1,Horrible experience with Awesome Collections,"I thought I was getting Bag Pipes for my Daughter to learn to play. They came with no holes drilled in the Chanter, the bag leaked, the drones did not fit. Sid (big shot with Awesome Collections in Pakistan) assured me if I sent them back he'd reimburse me for the pipes and shipping. He did give my initial money for the pipes back but refused to pay shipping which was $93.00. Amazon, after months of emails, gave me $93 worth of Amazon credit. Sid actually said he'd pay me half of the shipping if I would give his company a 5 star rating. (Lying is an art form in Pakistan) I wouldn't trust Sid to pass me the salt at dinner. I'd like to give Awesome Collections a negative 5 stars. I can't believe Amazon keeps these guys in their catalog. The other reviews here say; get a good chanter, practice with the chanter first, take lessons, then buy a quality product. Wise words."
5,Rare Gem !!!!,"For all of you have never heard of this band now it is time to find out what you have been missing. WS has been around since 1990, and was ahead of there time. This Classic has most of there greatest songs ever recorded on one album. I believe they did not get the credit they deserve because they where to anti-Goverment (Hell, they where just telling the truth!). I have all there cds to date and plan adding the newest one, which will be released this year 2001. What do you have to lose? Buy it and you will see what you have been missing. I play WS for people to this day and they can't believe they are not on the radio. Well good luck and god bless!! >))))""><""((((<"
5,Why did Bone Chillers just disappear all of a sudden?,I always enjoyed watching Bone Chillers on Saturday Mornings. Even though it was more funny than it is scary. It was an excellent television show. Too bad they don't have the book series or the t.v. series on anymore...I miss that show...So entertaing...
4,good tool for the garden,"I think that the poulan cultivator works very good in the garden. I bought mine and it did a great job loosening up the soil for planting and works good for running between rows chopping up any weeds that are growing. Don't fool yourself though, this is not a heavy duty rototiller. Your not going to turn up your whole yard and replant the grass! I have a 20 x 80 foot garden an it works great, however I originally put this garden in with a rototiller."
3,"First Use, Gear Stripped","Purchased for my husband as a gift in April. He went to use it to redo some areas of our yard that needed reseeding. Worked well but within the first hour, the tiller stopped turning. It has a stripped gear shift and the only co that does warranties for it in our area said after having it for a week, they are still waiting on the replacement part from Poulan. So much for reseeding this fall. They don't know when they will get the part from Poulan."
4,A good little cultivator for the $$,"Purchased as an attachment for my TroyBilt string trimmer. Wasn't sure what to expect as far as power but this attachment digs right through soil backed by the TroyBilt 31cc motor.It is a bit cumbersome to handle for tall folks. Has potential to really get away from you. Make sure the handle on the shaft is tight. For the price, this is great way to turn over the soil."
3,Strong but not efficient,"I purchased this item based on in depth research and reviews from those who use it. So far I had no problems with it. It seems to be strong built, but I will see if it stands the wear of time. It is a heavy attachment and not very easy to handle. It does not go deeper than 1-2 inches in the soil unless the soil has been previously broken manually, yet the soil must be moist. Then it will go in about 3-4 inches if that. To me it seems to be more like a heavy toy, not a very useful or efficient tool. It may a professional one for its strong built but it is a beginner for its applicability and/or practicability. Quality-wise it deserves 4 stars but for efficiency only 3."
5,The glory of Sir Edward Elgar,"This album is ""historical"" with the performances having been recorded in 1947 and 1956 (stereo). I continue to be heartened by the astonishing sonic restorations available to today's listeners and this CD is yet another example. Sir John Barbirolli's interpretation should satisfy anyone who admires the 1st symphony. This is not just Elgar's big ""Tune"" as Elgar was known to have described the main theme of the first movement. This is a sophisticated and profoundly worked out orchestral piece, waiting to be explored by those who think they have heard it all, but think Elgar was a stuffy Victorian."
5,Excellent book!,The minute I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I love the way Mike shows you on how to let your dog be an actual hunting dog and not just a dog for field trials. By reading his book you can tell Mike has an extreme love for dogs. I highly reccomend this book!
2,Not a typical Karen Ranney book,"This book was very slow and very boring. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was out of respect for Ms. Ranney's previous books. The lead characters came out of nowhere (especially the heroine). Neither hero or heroine had any personality. It really was a depressing book, and not expected of Ms. Ranney."
2,not happy,the first set of covers i received were the wrong covers so i sent them back the next set i received had the logo half in the seem so it look's like i bought seconds.
2,Don't waste your time,"If you, like myself, absolutely loved reading Bridges of Madison County and were content with the ending, don't waste your time on this epilogue. Yes, it would have been wonderful if Francesca and Robert could have met again later in life but we know from reading Bridges, they did not. They both lived a good life having their ashes sprinkled over Roseman Bridge upon their deaths. In A Thousand Country Roads, it's like you get your hopes up that there's a possibility they will see each other again all the while knowing it's just not going to happen. This book tells a little bit of what happened in their lives after meeting each other and confirms that what they had was indeed unique and very special. Neither could be with anyone else for a lifetime afterwards. I read the book simply because the first story touched me so deeply. This one left me feeling blue."
1,Not Very Happy,"I WANT TO READ ""THOUSAND COUNTRY ROADS"" ON MY KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I HAVE BEEN AN AMAZON AND KINDLE CUSTOMER TO BE LEFT OUT IN RWAD A BOOK OF MY CHOICE JUST BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE IT AVALIABLE IN PRINT ON MY KINDLE. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME AGREE WITH BARNES AND NOBLE'S NOOK IS BETER THEN KINDLE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IN BRAGGING ABOUT Y'ALL, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME STOOP THAT LOW."
1,Can I get a refund?,"This is one book I should have borrowed from the library...""Bridges"" was one of a kind, turn-paging and heartfelt drama which I could not put down till I completed it. ""Country Roads..."" is long and drawn out, boring, with no hooks whatsoever, nothing to make you want to keep reading through the end. I was relieved when it was over and wished I hadn't looked forward to Francesca and Robert's ""in-between"" story so much because it was such a disappointment. Mr. Waller has a wonderful gift but with this story, he missed the mark terribly."
2,"A Thousand Country Roads, a book that wasn't","We knew that Robert and Francesca had not met since the four days; however, I expected the book to promote some emotional connection to ""Bridges"". I enjoyed the beginning of the book but felt that, without any connective commitment, another manuscript was cut and pasted at the last minute. The author admitted he wanted to write about Sinclair... too bad he didn't do that. Thankfully, Clint Eastwood was able to do with the movie what the ""epilogue"" could not do, preserve the reasonance of the story."
4,Infectious,"How could you not dance to this? This album being my only source of knowledge about Zimbabwe music, I wonder if the country's musicians are capable of making music anything less than utterly positive. Besides being danceable and utterly positive, this music is also rich and complex, allowing new discoveries with each listen."
4,unavailable but available,"This album may not be available anymore, but some tracks are. Henry Essence have recently put their entire back catalogue onto their official website at http://www.henryessence.co.uk, so you can get your hands on 'Margarita' and other lost gems."
4,Child,This book has met the end of learning about Anxiety and how early childhood teachers can learn to address it.
3,Good costume prop,"Served its purpose at Halloween, but the fit is way too large for a normal sized head. I had to tailor it to fit and sit right. The feather is poor quality. I will look to replace that part of it later on. I had to line the cone portion of the hat with a stiff paper cone so it would be balanced and not flop all over the place. The hat band is solid green and not green and black checkered pattern as was worn in the films. Not good if you want authenticity, but ok if you just want a similar look. Fabric is lower grade. It would have been so much better in a velvet for stabilility and richness. I made it work, but I would not buy this again."
4,Beautiful & Worshipful,I discovered this album when doing a song search. I decided to pick it up and I'm so glad. It is a wonderful and sweet worship album. I love the mixture of voices and many different instruments. I love the honest and raw worship. I would recommend this album highly.
5,Trash ero,I like this! So trashy and naked in all sorts...messy and very tickeling! Easy to feel horny...
3,"Good machine, but only usable with tricks.","The first impression was very good. The coffee maker made out of shiny stainless steel looks very solid and impressive.After we have unpacked everything we tried to make our first espresso, following all steps in the manual. When we turned the button to the position for coffee, a lot of steam escaped and part of the coffee powder was blown out. In the cup was only light brown water.We repeated the procedure and the third cup of coffe was OK. We turned off the machine and repeated the procedure with the same result. In the meantime we have learned that after each new warming up start, one first has to reliese steam without the coffeee holder, until the hot water comes out. After that, even the first cup of coffee is perfect like all the following."
5,A great deal to make great espresso,"I like this machine enough that I bought two of them. One for home and one for the office. It makes great espresso, warms up quickly, has a good size tank, and is easy enough to use for my wife (who is techno-phobic) to figure out and she loves it too.The second machine I bought had a drip tray that was corroded by the coffee, but Lello replaced it free of charge. Great customer care!"
3,Good for the money,I am not an expert on this type of product however I can say that for the first time in my life I am experiencing an excellent cup of coffee every morning. One thing that is a little irritating is that you have to wait at times for the machine to convert the water into steam when heating up the milk. Another is that I had to order a second machine because the first did not work. All in all I am happy with my purchase mainly because of the price.
3,leooo Ariete Espresso Maker,"We are still experimenting with this machine. The finished espresso still is not consistent. When making two cups of coffee, two uneven streams of coffee flow. This makes it difficult to get a uniform strength.I am reading the various forum topics and notice that quite a few people have similar problems. A number to contact would be helpful."
4,... on the cobblestones of Florence I enjoy my espresso!,"Paid $99, shipped FREE. Got it in 4 days - works like a charm. It's solid, classy-looking and makes a perfect espresso/cap/latte. Illy coffee makes the difference too. Choose a good-quality coffee, folks, and use filtered water for a fine result. Frothing the milk yields a bit of a clunking noise (not hugely disruptive) but a tad loud (4 stars.) All in all - it's really a steal! IMHO - nothing can compare, for the price."
2,It's finally coming- in time for the Holidays!,Poof it finally appeared....Hallelujah mine is scheduled to arrive today- what a great surprise! Don't give up-it will arrive eventually...now I just have to see if it works and or if it is damaged. Wish me luck- I will post my results in a weeks' time.2 Stars for now.....
1,The Phantom Espresso Maker,"Ordered this Sep 8, and I'm a week shy of waiting two months for it to ship.It looks like a really nice machine, and it's at a great price, but I have no way of really knowing since I've never seen it.Amazon graciously upgraded me to nicer shipping (instead of taking 1000+7 days, now it will take 1000+3! Wow!), but my estimated ship date just keeps coming and then getting pushed back again."
3,Good for beginners,"Pair this machine with a decent grinder, around the $100-$150 range and you've got a good set up. My mistake was going with a cheaper Braun grinder, it lacks the consistency needed for good espresso.With the right technique, you will be making perfectly timed shots. Only complaint I have is that this machine seems only make five or six double shots before it runs out of steam. After that,the coffee starts breaking up and boiling, literally exploding from the portafilter.Machine is well built and attractive looking. The finish is easy to maintain. The bottom of my drip tray is starting to corrode and peel away after only a few months. I expect this machine to last two or three years. I'll be looking at a Gaggia or Rancilio as my next machine."
5,LOVE this Espresso Maker,"After looking at espresso makers for over a year, I finally broke down and ordered this machine. I've been SO happy with my purchase. I seems like a great alternative to the run of the mill Krups-like machine or the much more expensive products. It is attractive and makes a great cappuccino. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I haven't used my ""normal"" coffee maker since the day this arrived and was just thinking today that I might move it to the basement. The cup warmer on the top is the only feature that I would note is fairly worthless. Unless you are going to leave the machine on, it takes too long to warm your mug."
4,Great quality for a great price!,This machine is a great deal-- makes excellent coffee. Looks like a $500+ machine.
2,malfunctioning already?,"We waited from July to December for this item to arrive. It's barely into January and it is already broken. We treat our appliances with great care, so it was not abused. When it works, it makes excellent coffee. However, I am shocked that it is already broken. For us, it was a waste of alot of money."
2,"The good, bad, and ugly.","This is the second time I have purchased one of these coffee makers. It makes great coffee quickly and it is dependable. My major gripe is with the drip tray. They are crap. I shelled out an extra 25 bucks for the latest one thinking that surely for that much more they put in a stainless steel tray. Nooooo, it's the same painted or coated junk as the last one. You would think that this is no big deal but the coating bubbles up and falls off and rust bubbles up and over the sides rendering it uncleanable and simply downright ugly. I would hold out for a maker with a stainless steel drip tray. I have had this new one for a few months an have resorted to foil to attempt to stave off the budding cancer which is already moving right along. Why a company would go to such great pains to build a good product and then finish it off with this kind of crap is a mystery to me. Other than this I would go five stars but the tray is a real downer,"
3,a little help please...,"so recently my boyfriend noticed that i drink alot of espresso so he bought me this very nice hefty machine. it looks great, but my problem is... i don't know what i'm doing with it! where's the manual?i was very excited to get started with it so i bought some ese pods and a can of grounds. i pulled a couple of shots, but honestly i have no idea what i'm doing. they were so-so. can someone with this particlar machine give me a 101? i would greatly appreciate it, thanks!"
4,I have had it for 8 mo. and It colapsed....,I have had expressos every day since I got this. The first unit had to be returned and replaced because it would not work. This one that I've had for 8 mo. has worked great till psat month. It won't deliver the coffee. I done everything the manual tells you to do in order to troubleshoot without resolve. I don't know where to turn. The company is in Italy but apparently like most american companies the product is manufactured in China. I want to see if they will allow me to use the 1 year warranty that they guarantee... I really like this expresso machine and wish I could replace it.... I gave it 4 starts because it has worked great and is easy to handle. Any begginer can learn who to make the most amazing Cappucinos:)...
2,"Use of this appliance can be dangerous, be warned!","I gave this Espresso maker to my wife as a birthday present. While I was at work she took the instructions and was trying to make some Espresso. The result was a broken cup, coffee all over the place and my 3 year old daughter having 2nd degree burns. This required a visit to the Emergency Room.I am not sure what exactly went wrong and if it affects all units or just a few, but apparently the same ""explosion"" (the porta filter violently flying off) happened to at least 3 more people. Definitely the instructions how to ""lock"" the porta-filter are neither clear nor sufficient and the design appears to be flawed.If you own this Espresso maker and still decide to use it, please be very careful, and keep your kids at a distance. I don't want to happen to anybody else what happened to my little daughter."
4,The best coffee maker!!!,"I love this machine,it makes the greatest coffee. I lost it in one trip, so I'm getting a new one. Some other friends after our experience got one to.The only problem that this machine has is the metallic tray that will rotten with the coffee drips if you are not careful."
2,Worked less then a year,"When it worked, it worked nice but,it should last longer then 9 months. The machine fails to steam Milk or pull a shot of Expresso. I suspect the pump has failed."
3,Lello 1375,"This is a replacement machine for me.I have had machines with better steamer wand operation. Otherwise, it is fine.The water tank is a little difficult to manage compared to others also. It is tall and narrow, making it difficult to disconnect. Then ""handle"" is the cover and it appears to not be strong enough to use as a handle when the tank is full. Also, to connect it, there are two plastic tabs on the back of the machine that must be lined up correctly. They are difficult to find without turning the maker around. Further, these tabs are easily broken - so be careful."
4,Above average machine.,"This is my third cappuccino maker and by far the best I've purchased.Pros: Good and hot steam frother, pump driven, sleek/beautiful look, good quality cappuccino.Cons: Can be a bit noisy when running.Overall, highly recommended for entry-level cappuccino/espresso makers."
2,Nice tiles - Packaged Poorly,Plastic holders and case came damaged. It was packaged poorly in a box 20 times the size of the set. I returned the time and Amazon promptly refunded the purchase price.
1,Used damaged product,"After this set arrived, I opened the box and two of the racks were broken and did not match the other two racks. Also the cellophane over the tiles was broken open and it was definitely a used and damaged set. It was very upsetting and Amazon promptly sent me (by email) a label to return the product."
3,Travel MJ Set,"Price was very good. Set is helpful for players who wish to practice putting together various hands on the mah jongg card. Set is not usable for regular play... can't build walls, and tiles are thin and too wide for the racks."
2,An expensive let-down for sure,"This case has a couple of things going for it: the extra pockets are very nice to have, the construction is solid and the materials are a nice alternative to leather. My main problem with this case is that it doesn't do it's job which is to carry and protect the device inside. The elastic bands lose their pull within a week, and when your device is under them it's very hard to use. Even when the elastic was fresh my Handspring wouldn't stay underneath them.In short, the decision to use elastic bands to hold the PDA are a design flaw that for me killed an otherwise great case. Avoid this one."
1,Book of the Long wind,Wolfe has significantly lost his form in this series compared with the Book of the New Sun. He's trying for the same sense of phantasmagoria but fails. You can see him trying too hard. The world is unconvincing - I tried to suspend belief and just go with the flow but it was just too slow.
2,"What in the ""Whorl"" is going on?",The biggest letdown in my recent reading memory. None of the plotlines were brought together in any satisfying way - yet this was supposed to be the last in a series of four novels.Even Wolfe must feel the need for wrapping up all those loose ends since he's releasing yet another volume.
1,SIZE? ANYONE? ...BULLER?,"Ah, just a suggestion... they might sell better if you include the size!!! DUH!!!"
3,AJL,Very dissappointed with the range. Not a far as my old 2.4GHZ. Three walls within the house makes the signal break up.
5,Define success,"It's not the sounds that are disjointed, incongruent and senseless, it's the world. On Dazzle Ships, dismayed idealists struggle to make sense of it all - or at least bring it to the forefront of the listening mind. Predating U2's equally dystopic, less reckless and more profitable Zooropa by a decade, it is as relevant today as it was in 1983.The Dazzle Ships montage, a carefully composed collection of bangs, echoes, beeps and voices, dares to explore the chilling question: What does impending death sound like?The multilingual automated speaking clocks on Time Zones relentlessly count down to . . . something.As in life, moments of order, and even beauty, punctuate the album, such as in Genetic Engineering, Telegraph and Romance of the Telescope.As a soundtrack to world disorder, the album met with commercial disaster. Still, Dazzle Ships remains among the most maligned albums ever to get it right."
2,Moments,"This film had a couple of moments which held interest, but for the most part I found it extremely superficial and well, narcissistic on the part of the film makers. I am not by any means an expert on Derrida, and was looking forward to learning a bit more about him and his philosophy. I came away from it feeling as if the filmmakers finished this thing congratulating themselves on making a film about an important philosopher, but not having actually bothered to investigate much about what he has written and said. Say what you might about Derrida, he seems to have a curious and thoroughly investigative spirit, which is more than you can say for the boorish creaters of this movie. I was disappointed."
3,DERIDING DERRIDA,"I'm not familiar with Derrida's work so this review is not so much about the man but about the film about the man. It begins as we watch the Philosopher trying to cope with the minutae of existence: getting dressed and searching for car keys. Then it segues to his US tour where fawning academics hang on his every word. If you like that sort of thing this film will be a real treat for you. Otherwise, you might try my new favorite film: Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story.Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story"
1,unbelievably self-absorbed and insipid,"Agree with the prior customer views, big time. On Derrida's resistance to the project, he gets no complaint from me. He clearly gave extraordinary access and tried very hard to cooperate, but the crew was so intrusive and inefficient with lights and mikes and the questions so insipid, that he just seemed constantly amazed at what he was being subjected to. Alas, name it Derrida Butters His Toast if you want to do some self-inflated student art project. I learned close to zero about Derrida the thinker, other than he seems to be a nice old French fellow with a long standing marriage and a successful practice in teaching and writing.Taking on a project with this potential, spending years with this level of intimate access, and calling it Derrida, suggesting breadth of content, but bringing little insight about his thinking to the screen outside of mostly silly gimmicks, is a sad sad thing."
3,immature,"This film could've been a lot better--let's hope someone with a bit more philosophical aplomb and cinematagraphic acuity runs into Derrida! A start, but certainly not the last word on the philospher. In fact, one gets the feeling throughout the film that Derrida himself thinks this project will inevitably crash into gaseous cliches and unharnessed energy. Really, one is better off sneaking into NYU and hearing him speak..."
5,I have been STAIND,"This is another awesome band with another awesome CD. Although this isn't STAIND's first album, it is by far the most accessable and commercialized. This band rocks! Personally, the vocals are what really gets my attention, even tho I am a musician rather than a singer. The guitar, bass, and drums are all good, but the voice of the lead singer is so ear-catching, that one has to stop and listen to it. RECOMMENDED HIGHLY!"
4,"Good hard band, fills the Alice in Chains void in my life.","Solid album, not %100 origial, but what is? These guys are great if you like really heavy music. Somewhat like Tool, Alice in Chains or Godsmack."
4,Great Sophmore Effort,"This CD is straight from the text book of groove oriented rock. The next phase in the Helmet esque guitar arena. Melodic guitars and raw emotion make this a very disturbing yet a must have for your cd collection. The guitar parts are structured in an ever so brilliant manner. Coupled with the melodies and the lyrical content, this cd will take you on a trip to the darkest places in your mind. No doubt, a band that can rock and will be around for a long time."
4,Grit your teeth and bear it. It's worth it!,Thankfully Fred from Biskit talked this band into screaming less and singing more. The singer in this band has an awesome voice and only brings the CD down when he screams. A little wail or scream is always good here and there but too much and you lose me. This CD doesnt lose me till the last couple of songs. I want to headbang and drive fast with one song then cry and drink with the next. This CD is as good or better than Godsmack's debut.Where is the next CD?!!!!!! It time for #2!
5,"Staind KoRn rip-offs, what are you on about ??","How can you say that Staind are KoRn rip-offs they sound nothing like them for gods sake, your just one of these Die Hard KoRn fans who want to belive that every band ever sounds like KoRn, for one Staind at the moment are a better band that the recently (well since the first album) Lame KoRn, anyway think before you make your accusations. Whats next ""How come Britney Spears can get away with ripping off KoRn so much"" Anyway i dont like the way Meatal music is going in America these days, i still live where its unfashionable to like KoRn, RATM, Limp Bizkit or Staind"
4,"Nice, but not great","I like this CD (I don't own it but I've heard it) and probably my favorite track is Just Go. I love the vocal/guitar dissonance that song has, it really hits you. I also love the secret song after the 9th track. It's a one-man acoustic guitar peice and it's very cool. The only thing I really have againced it is that like alot of albums today, it is very repetative. Bands need to have different music on their albums. That's why I like the secret song, because it is totally different from the rest of the album."
2,boring,"These guys should have stayed far away from fred durst. they would have eventually made it big without him and they probably would have recorded a much better record. this disc has a few tight songs, but over all are too repetitious and sound like the same old thing i keep hearing on the radio and MTV. maybe someday they'll wise up and come up with something new and original because i know they have it in them."
4,Definitely Different,"Staind is my favorite band, even though I just recently (as of the summer) got really into them. I LOVE 14 Shades of Gray, and Chapter V is amazing too. So when I got Dysfunction, I was totally amazed. It is much more hardcore than the two most recent albums. Of course, Aaron Lewis makes all the songs have meaning and emotion with his unique voice, which is what I think sets them apart from all the other bands out there. My favorite song was by far the hidden track, which is a ballad. It is depressing but beautiful. People who fell in love with their newer stuff might find this album to be too much screaming (yes, screaming). Actually, most of the songs on this album remind me of Infest (Papa Roach). Anyone who likes Staind will like this album, but you have to have an appreciation for different variations of rock. Just wanted to put out a warning to fans like me who had no idea Aaron Lewis could actually scream and make it sound musical."
5,"This CD frikin kiks, buy it now","Raw is in my opinion the best song on this disk but if you like limp bizkit, KoRn, and stuff like that youll like this. its phat as hell"
2,My worst impulse buy... Regret it every single day,"Aside from 3 songs, this album is horrible. If you buy this album, you seriously need to reconsider your own intelligence (or lack thereof)."
4,Refreshing and Intriguing,"Though I read this account two years ago, I still vividly recall of my impressions. This is not a book you soon forget. Though some say this is hype or improbable, I found it believable and think it was accurately written (however,I am sure certain details were left out). Mr. Barris makes no apologies for his behavior, which I found particularly interesting because to do what he did one would have to be able to be an emotionless sociopath or psychopath. He is obviously highly intelligent and for someone who created many of the game shows we still watch 40 years later, this was the ultimate game! Anyone who favors the genre of murder mysteries or finds True Crime intriguing, would not want to pass up this book. I also think those in law enforcement and the psychology professions would gain insight into the motivations of a hired killer.If you enjoyed the movie, the book is much better!"
5,THE BOSS OF ALL BOSSES!,"Plain and simple, Boss Bitch is BANGIN! Along with the rest of the Raise up record click, they put down an instant Memphis classic. If you enjoy tommy wright III, Gangsta Boo, and 3-6 mafia, you'll love Boss. She has a tight and unique rap style,(with a lil TUNG TWISTIN TA BOOT!) that could be consider by some equal or even superior to La Chat and Gangsta Boo. You think MYSTIKAL can get LOUD AND CRAZY wait till you hear Boss. GREAT lyrical skills by her and her tight gueststars(Bar None, Krazy K, Corrosion, many others)bringin new talant, and the beats are just BANGIN on every track. My favorites"
4,i <3 creative products,these headphones definitely do not disapoint. you are not going to get much better for the price. the sound is great and they fit pretty darn well into your ears.
2,I couldn't get interested in this book,"I have tried to read this book; however, it took more than the first chapter and more to get to the point. I think novels should begin with some sort of ""bang"" to hook readers in. This didn't happen in this book."
3,What's all this?,"I really enjoy the song ""1999"" and this new version is just as good as the orignial, but what's all these different versions here all about? Most sound little like the original and one is practicaly just the lyrics just being read out loud. Weird."
3,Where did these songs come from?,"I have to admit I'm not a diehard Ricky Nelson fan so others may not agree with my opinion, but I was disappointed with this CD. There are 4 or 5 big sellers that are very good, but most of the others I'd never heard of and do not care for. They might be early songs, but I remember watching this kid grow up and liked his singing then.Quality is okay, but I just don't care for the playlist."
1,Same weird problem...,"Installation wasn't too bad; I used the optional 'T harness' to make the connections to the ignition switch. However, I have the same problem now that another user here reported: Every once in awhile the remote goes ""out of range"" (the antenna icon disappears) when I try to start the car. I could be standing right next to the car and it doesn't matter -- it thinks that it is out of range. I have to try several more times to try to get it to start. I have no confidence that this thing is going to work now if I'm not standing right next to the car to see if it really started. So, not much use as a remote starter. I'm calling Bulldog tomorrow; if they can't get this working right or send me a working replacement it is going to be ripped out of the car and sent back for a refund."
3,Edit; Worked great for awhile,"Installed this in two Mazda 6 cars in the Summer of 2010. The Summer of 2012 the one Mazda 6 that we still own started getting a dead battery when it was not used for a week or so. This car has recently passed only 15,000 miles so the battery should not be bad. I tested it with a tool that performs a drain test and it was bad. I replaced the battery and the dead battery problem came back. The only thing that stopped the battery from draining was to unhook the Bulldog Remote Starter. I plan to upgrade to a better brand next Summer."
1,AWFUL Customer Service,"I have had a Bulldog remote starter for a few years. Remotes break at least twice a year. They were always good about replacing it but once I actually got one to last a year I had to buy one. That's fine. First NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE. I MEAN EVER! You have to leave a message the may call today they may call tomorrow or the next day. I bought a new remote $19.99. That sounds fair I guess, but they charged me $12 to ship it. Basic shipping!!! I live in the same state (OHIO). Are you kidding. Besides the fact that you need to have a PHD to install it it does work good. By the way this replacement remote is $49.99"
2,Non-existent tech support,"I purchased this product a little over a year ago and it worked fine until about 5 months ago. The transmitter will not start the vehicle and only unlocks the doors after about 5 trys. I emailed their support several times for help but never received a response. I even called and got nowhere just like the other reviewer. Stay away from this product, you get what you pay for!"
3,Only one song,"I bought this CD years ago only because of one reason... the song ""The Promise"" which at the time I couldn't find anywhere else but on this CD. I thought that I would probably like the rest of the CD but I didn't. The other tracks do not compare to ""The Promise"" at all. To me, ""The Promise"" is clearly a ""One Hit Wonder""."
2,One song + filler,"One great song ""The Promise,"" does not an album make. After the first track it is all downhill. No surprise that this band became a one hit wonder."
3,sierra globe,"On the whole,globe is exactly as described and colors are lovely. Only criticism I have is that many of the boundaries(borders,rivers,etc.) are not adequately pronounced."
5,Great Product! No Problems! Avoid the Zoji!,I would avoid the Zojirushi for the prolems listed below. I've had this Panasonic Thermo Pot a couple of years and use it all the time. It never has had a problem with the lid rusting. The pump is very quiet and Everything on it works great. Would buy again.UPDATE The one the that the other party got and lid is rusting must of been a fluke. I have three different Panasonic thermal pot and have never had a rusting problem. I would avoid the Zojirushi: The electronic pump is very noisy and goes out of order after a couple of years
1,Not worth a dime!!,"I made a big mistake by choosing to buy this book by the Planchard's, it's not worth wasting your money and time. This book was supposed to be written for new users taking them to a learning curve which is supposed to assit them in step-by-step drawing process, unfortunately unlike other authors of 3-D design literature, this one is an utter fiasco and should be taken of the shelves of all vendors. I got lost in the middle of the commands and steps...maybe the authors assume that we know what the hell they're talking about!! in shorts this book is written for themselves probably. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TOUCHING IT."
1,C-H-E-A-P,"This ring is cheap and doesn't feel sturdy or even real. Actually, I don't think it is real titanium."
3,Any editing at all?,"I discovered the translations by the Maudes in the 1950's. Compared to what was available, they were terrific. This can be seen in the first parts of this fine novella. We then begin to get strange and stilted constructions, typos, and a strange refusal to capitalize names. Makes for an annoying read.I have this on kindle and listened to the audio version, following the text. The voice often sounds human, but too often sounds like a poorly educated machine. The meaning of sentences is distorted and the inclusion of punctuation marks adds a touch of humor that Tolstoy never intended. The audio feature degenrates into ludicrous farce in every one of the kindles I've sampled so far. Not as successful as it should be."
2,Buyer beware,"Oops! My book group wanted to do a ""short"" book with ""meat"" and we thought Hadji Murad by Tolstoy would be perfect. Without thinking I purchased the cheapest new Hadji Murad I saw.It's the Filiquarian Pulishing,LLC book I'm talking about. It turned out I'd purchased a book that reads like it was translated from the Russian by computer. It certainly never had a human editor. The spelling was bad but the grammar was worse. What I could tell was a wonderful, exciting and relevant story had no charm. Shame on Amazon for selling this. Shame on me for not sending this copy back and reading Hadji Murad as Tolstoy intended."
4,Makes a great gift for your favorite movie buff!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He wasn't expecting this; usually he gives me a list and I choose from it. I saw this while looking for one of his other selections and thought he'd like it. I figured, even if he doesn't, I will. We both love it! Great for listening on long drives up the turnpike!"
2,Serious deviation from original sounding themes,The serious soundtrack collector should be aware that of all the Silva Screen compilations - this box more than others deviates greatly from the orginal soundtrack recordings. In particular - Midnight Cowboy - becomes a layered jazz montage of the main theme.
1,Not what it seems,In the picture the bottle looks to have water in it. Which makes you think it comes with saline. It does not it is just the bottle. The item is listed as eyewash bottle but the picture is a little misleading.
1,"What kind of song is ""Liquid Dreams""?","When the show ""Making the Band"" debuted on ABC last year, I got hooked. I saw every episode but one. When I realized that O-Town has no vocal talent whatsoever, I moved on. However, when it was advertised that O-Town would sing at the Miss America Pageant, I was intrigued. When I watched, I was appalled. Not only was O-Town even worse musically, the lyrics to their song ""Liquid Dreams"" were horrible! On the CD, the sound is better, simply because of computer enhancing. With no positive traits, O-Town is not worth paying any attention to."
4,YOUR WORD IS FIRE.,"re YOUR WORD is FIRE: Hasidic masters on Contemplative Prayer.EASY to read and inspiring. Entries are a bit short, though."
4,"Great percussion, hypnotic melody","Rai Rebels captures the liberation music found in the port city of Oman in Algeria.Hypnotic Arab melodies marry a strong percussive beat for some of the most distinctively compelling music around.I could listen to ""Sidi Boumeddiene"" by Cheb Khaled on repeat for hours on end, for the extended instrumental of fading drums that make its conclusion.Unfortunately some of the other tunes are a bit monotonous, but what is good on this CD is very, very fine indeed -- nothing like it."
3,As Time goes By -You Must Remember This,"We avidly have viewed the first six seasons as they have been released on DVD - I was disappointed with this offering only because it covers series not yet released on DVD/VHS and eliminated any element of surprise regarding the forthcomng romances of Judy and Sandy. We started to view this DVD but decided to wait until they release the final three seasons to ""Remember this"""
5,A wonderful series,This series is one of the very finest TV comedy ever made. The British dry humor is delivered to perfection and the acting is without peer -- Geoffrey Palmer as Lionel Hardcastle and Dame Judy Dench as Jean Pargeter are superb as is the balance of the cast. The chapers never fail to please.
5,My Favorite Momus,I have nearly every Momus CD to date and this is the standout favorite in my book. Smart and creative. If you are interested in Momus this one is a safe bet.
5,great series,"I hope there will be more episodes soon. This is one of those great video series that's enjoyable for parents, too."
